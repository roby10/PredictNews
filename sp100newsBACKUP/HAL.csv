1,HAL,Analysis: Underdog Weatherford chases oilfield services pack,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As the smallest of the world’s big four oilfield services players, Weatherford International (WFT.N) always seems to have something to prove.  That’s especially true now, with its stock suffering since a $500 million accounting error unearthed this year only added to the uncertainty of a separate four-year corruption probe.  Pieced together by acquisitions a decade ago, the perpetual underdog of the full-service oil patch players is also under pressure to demonstrate how its many parts can work together.  Money has poured into the sector as high oil prices boost prospects all around. Yet like industry No. 3 Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N last year, Weatherford is the “show-me” stock of the bunch, according to Dahlman Rose analyst James Crandell, meaning that investors are waiting to be convinced.  “People want to see them put some quarters on the board before they begin to give the company credit,” Crandell said.  Investors generally have a good impression of Chief Executive Bernard Duroc-Danner, the smooth-spoken economics Ph.D. who built the company, but many are tired of waiting.  More funds fully sold out of Weatherford WFT.VX in the first quarter than bought initial stakes, according to the latest data, whereas the opposite was true for rivals Baker Hughes, Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), and Halliburton Co (HAL.N).  Baker Hughes in particular was handsomely rewarded for reviving its international arm: its stock is up 61 percent in the last year, and five analysts upgraded it in the past 90 days, versus Weatherford’s 29 percent rise and no upgrades.  “Right now Weatherford’s in the doghouse a bit,” Crandell said. “But I’m confident that Weatherford will deliver given the environment I see ahead.”  North America’s outlook only seems to get better. A survey of 445 exploration and production (E&P) firms by Crandell last month found 2011 spending set to grow 22 percent in the United States and 16 percent in Canada, up from forecasts of 8 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in December.  This spending is boosting the profits of Weatherford and others, but analysts say the real potential is elsewhere.  Duroc-Danner knows this well, having spent years gearing up outside North America to prepare for a battle that pitches his outfit against rivals with deep pockets and solid reputations.  “The overseas stuff is more likely to go to the brass nameplate people, but there is more opportunity <in the United States> for lesser names,” said Milt Ezrati, market strategist at Lord Abbett, which sold 36 percent of its Weatherford shares in the first quarter, taking its stake down to 0.8 percent.  Lord Abbett also sold 14 percent of its holding in industry leader Schlumberger. Ezrati, who declined to discuss particular stocks, sees the outlook for energy prices as flat, at best.  Yet oil prices are still around $100 a barrel, giving E&P firms enough profit margin to seek reliability over the value of Weatherford, long seen as the low-cost option in services, said Doug Sheridan, head of EnergyPoint Research in Houston.  “You’ve got a situation where being the scrappy underdog can only play so long,” Sheridan added. “At some point, people look at it and say, ‘You’re just a scrappy underdog.’”  Duroc-Danner, son of a Total (TOTF.PA) exploration head, became CEO in 1990 at Energy Ventures which, after its $2.5 billion Weatherford Enterra takeover in 1998, took on the new name and went on a three-year spree that swallowed 20 firms.  Sheridan said it could be argued that the company never truly integrated all these operations into a common culture.  A key test was its much-heralded bundled service contract at Chicontepec in Mexico, where it had to scale back last year as the country curtailed some oil developments.  The company has also faced four years of scrutiny of other adventures abroad. Various U.S. agencies are probing its part in Iraq’s oil-for-food program, along with its past operations in certain sanctioned countries, including Sudan and Iran.  The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Weatherford’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) compliance and the embezzlement of $175,000 in payments to government officials in Europe, according to company filings, beyond which it cannot comment.  Dan Newcomb, founder of the FCPA practice at law firm Shearman & Sterling, said the cases tend to run about two years, but can drag on depending on the complexity and number of countries involved. Such probes from multiple agencies can be enormously distracting for a company’s management, he said.  “During the investigation, everybody’s very worried about ‘Am I going to get fingered?’ — not just people who might justifiably be worried about it,” Newcomb said.  A record $800 million FCPA settlement by Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE), which took two years to resolve, is the benchmark.  “Siemens was enormously expensive, but it went to the very top of an organization in many, many countries,” Newcomb said. “This (Weatherford) isn’t at that level yet.”  Weatherford’s reputation took another hit in March when it had to adjust its results by $500 million over four years due to “material weakness” in its tax reporting.  The stock is down by a fifth since then, whereas the oil service sector .OSX has declined 4 percent in that time.  But change is afoot. The company is seeking a new top accountant and now has a chief operating officer. The promotion of Peter Fontana to COO late last year left Weatherford’s Eastern Hemisphere boss to seek “other opportunities,” but gave Dahlman Rose’s Crandell reason to believe in the turnaround.  “If the company can get its act together internationally, there’s a lot more upside than its peers,” said Crandell, who has followed the sector for three decades. “That’s a bet I’d be willing to make.”  ",7072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oilservices-weatherford/analysis-underdog-weatherford-chases-oilfield-services-pack-idUSTRE76661420110707
2,HAL,Texas jury rejects ex-KBR employee Iraq rape claim,"HOUSTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A Texas jury rejected claims brought by a woman who said she was raped by fellow employees while working for KBR Inc in Iraq six years ago, according to a KBR spokeswoman.  In a case that received attention across the United States, Jamie Leigh Jones alleged she was drugged and raped by KBR employees working as firefighters in Baghdad and accused the company of tolerating abusive behavior and sexual harassment.  But a company spokeswoman said on Friday the federal jury in Houston found in favor of KBR and a former KBR firefighter also named in the lawsuit “on all counts.”  Jones had sought compensatory and punitive damages from KBR, an engineering group that was once the biggest U.S. military contractor in Iraq, and Halliburton Co, KBR’s parent until its 2007 separation.  The lawyer for Jones was not immediately available for comment.  The Jones case generated many headlines because of other KBR controversies in Iraq and the fact that Halliburton and KBR fought to settle the case through arbitration, as specified in her contract.  KBR asked the U.S. Supreme Court to consider its case for arbitration over a court case, before withdrawing that petition last year.  “Since 2005, KBR has been subjected to a continuing series of lies perpetuated by the plaintiff in front of Congress, in the media, and to any audience wishing to lend an ear to this story,” KBR said in a statement.  “The outcome of this jury trial as judged by her peers is the same result that the State Department got in the 2005; that the Justice Department found in 2008,” KBR added.  The case in U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas is Jamie Leigh Jones v. Halliburton Company d/b/a KBR Kellogg Brown & Root et al., 07-2719.

6,HAL,GE names new head of oil and gas equipment unit," GREENVILLE, S.C., July 13 (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) named Dan Heintzelman, 54, to head its fast-growing oil and gas equipment business.   He will succeed Claudi Santiago, 54, who is retiring, the largest U.S. conglomerate said on Wednesday.   Heintzelman, currently head of GE Energy Services, will become chief executive of a GE unit that played a major role in the company’s $11 billion wave of energy-related acquisitions over the past year, which included takeovers of Dresser Inc and Britain’s Wellstream Holdings.   With oil prices on the rise — U.S. crude futures CLc1 are up 30 percent over the past year — and a renewed interest in natural gas production in the United States, Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE has zeroed in on equipment sales to oilfield services companies such as Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) as a growth area.   “We think this is a platform where we’ve got some competitive advantage that can grow for a long period of time organically,” GE CEO Jeff Immelt told investors in May.   Heintzelman will succeed Santiago in December.

7,HAL,UPDATE 1-Halliburton to tap Poland shale for Chevron," * Work to begin in fourth quarter   * Three-year contract; financial details not released   * Halliburton shares firm slightly   NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - Oilfield services company Halliburton Co (HAL.N) said it had won a contract to help oil giant Chevron Corp (CVX.N) tap into Poland’s vast shale rock formations in search of natural gas.   Halliburton is the leading player in hydraulic fracturing of shale in the United States, where the controversial technology has been used to unlock huge quantities of gas that were too difficult and expensive to tap only a decade ago.   So far, only a handful of test wells have been drilled in Poland’s shale rock, but geologists have estimated the fields there and in other Eastern European countries may contain massive amounts of natural gas.   Poland is not expected to begin significant natural gas production for at least a decade because of the need to build infrastructure for the energy industry there.   Currently, Eastern Europe is heavily dependent on Russian shipments of natural gas.   Halliburton said on Wednesday that work under the three-year contract is expected to begin in the fourth quarter. Financial details of the contract were not released.   Shares of Houston-based Halliburton rose 43 cents to $52.65 in early trading.

8,HAL,"BP promises safer drilling, without admitting flaws","LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - BP Plc promised improved drilling practices on Friday as the company balances twin aims of rebuilding investor and public confidence after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill while not admitting flaws in its own procedures.  BP said it would more closely oversee the work of its contractors, echoing its position that the rig blast, which killed 11 men and led to the spill, was the fault of its contractors, including driller Transocean and Halliburton.  The companies have filed lawsuits worth tens of billions of dollars blaming each other for the blast, and any admission by BP that its existing drilling procedures needed improvements could weaken its legal position.  BP said it would also establish centers for monitoring its drilling wells in real time — something some rivals already do and which might have prevented the well blow-out that caused the disaster.  The London-based company declined to comment on whether it was addressing shortcomings in its internal procedures that were highlighted in government investigations, such as its reliance on a single barrier to keep oil and gas in the well.  BP’s rivals including Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and BG Group have criticized its design for the Macondo well, saying it contributed to the disaster.  BP said its plans go beyond regulatory requirements.  “BP clearly understands that they have to win back not only the regulators’ confidence, but the confidence of the public as well,” the head of the U.S. offshore drilling regulator, Michael Bromwich, said at a congressional hearing in Washington.  The regulator has already established strong, new safety and environmental standards that all operators are required to meet, said Bromwich, director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement.  Appointed after the BP spill to overhaul the drilling regulator, Bromwich said he has been pleased by BP’s cooperation with the agency since the disaster. He welcomed BP’s plans to strengthen safety.  “We’ll always look favorably on companies that will impose on themselves higher safety standards than what our current regulations require,” Bromwich said.  The agency will consider whether to encompass any of the voluntary standards BP has adopted as it moves ahead with plans to develop additional drilling regulations, Bromwich said.  A BP source told Reuters in April that the company had filed one drilling application. The agency would not offer specific details on Friday about any pending BP applications to drill exploratory wells.  BP said on Friday that it would only use blow-out preventers (BOPs) — devices designed to prevent uncontrolled releases of oil and gas from wells — with twin sets of shears which could slice through drill pipes, and that it would have third parties verify the testing of BOPs.  The failure of the BOP on the rig that was drilling BP’s Macondo well contributed to the oil spill, although the panel convened by President Barack Obama to investigate the disaster said even if it worked properly the fatal blast would still have occurred.  BP will also require lab testing of the cement mixtures its outside cementing contractors recommend for lining and sealing oil wells, and provide the results to the offshore safety regulator.  BP’s Chief Executive Bob Dudley, who took over from Tony Hayward after the leaking Macondo well was capped, had previously outlined some of the measures at public events in the past month.  Representative Edward Markey, the top Democrat on the U.S. House Natural Resources committee, said BP’s plans show that offshore drillers can comply with tougher safety rules.  “It is time for the oil industry and their Republican allies in Congress to drop their opposition to stronger requirements,” said Markey, an outspoken critic of the oil industry.  “If BP can do this, so can everyone else,” he said.

14,HAL,Halliburton profit jumps on strong U.S. demand,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the world’s second-largest oilfield services company, reported a forecast-topping 54 percent jump in profit on Monday as a U.S. onshore drilling boom showed no sign of cooling off.  The second-quarter results clearly demonstrate how Halliburton has benefited from its North American leadership in the pressure pumping technology that enables oil and gas producers to tap in to shale rock.  High oil prices have prompted those producers to plunge billions of dollars into developing fields such as the Eagle Ford shale in Texas, creating a tighter market for equipment that allowed Halliburton to push through price rises.  “It was both top and bottom lines, and a significant component was pricing,” said Roger Read, an analyst with Morgan Keegan & Co.  The North American boom was likely to last through 2012, helped by the move to more developments that benefit from high oil prices as natural gas drilling slows.  “What we are seeing in North America, plus the continued international recovery, will lead to even a more favorable earnings picture as we go through 2011 and beyond,” Chief Executive Dave Lesar told analysts on a conference call.  Second-quarter net profit climbed to $739 million, or 80 cents per share, from $480 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, it earned 81 cents per share, topping the average analyst estimate of 74 cents from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Second-quarter revenue rose 35 percent to $5.9 billion and came in above the average analyst forecast of $5.71 billion. (For a graphic on Halliburton versus its competitors: r.reuters.com/dyw62s )  UBS analyst Angie Sedita, who anticipates more positive earnings surprises from Halliburton driven by North America, noted that the stock traded at a discount to its peers.  Shares of industry leader Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), with far more exposure to markets beyond North America, were down 0.5 percent on Monday morning while those of Houston-based rival Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N rose along with Halliburton.  Halliburton said its margins would grow more slowly in the third quarter than in the second due to cost inflation and a slowdown in the recovery of Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling as new permits become harder to come by.  “The pace of permit issuance has slowed again and the fact that some of the initially permitted wells are nearing completion creates a risk that the Gulf recovery could slow or stall in the second half of 2011,” Lesar said.  Second-quarter activity outside North America was soft. While seasonal pickups in the North Sea and Russia lifted revenue, the Libya shutdown, delays in Iraq, rising sub-Saharan Africa costs and sluggish markets in Britain and Algeria all cut into profits in those markets. Lesar said those factors shaved 4 percentage points off Eastern Hemisphere margins.  Halliburton shares were up 0.3 percent at $53.22 on Monday even as a 2 percent drop in oil prices hurt the sector .OSX.

20,HAL,UPDATE 4-Rowan deal takes Ensign Energy to US south," * Ensign to buy Rowan land rig division for $510 mln   * Marks Rowan’s exit from onshore rig business   * Rowan to deploy proceeds into offshore drilling   * Rowan stock rises 4 pct, Ensign 3 pct   (Adds analysts’ comments in paragraphs 7 and 12, link to Dealtalk, interview)	   By Krishna N Das	   BANGALORE, July 20 (Reuters) - Canada’s Ensign Energy Services , an oilfield services provider, said it will acquire 30 land drilling rigs from U.S. company Rowan Companies Inc for $510 million to expand into the oil-rich shale fields in southern United States.	   Global exploration and production companies have piled on to the shale fields — underground rock formations rich in oil and gas — as crude oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 continue to rise. This boom in U.S. onshore drilling has helped sales at most services providers, including the world’s No. 2, Halliburton .	   Ensign, which provides drilling, production testing and  well services to the oil and gas industry, is already present in the Rocky Mountain region and California. Buying the 30 high-power rigs from Rowan will help it tap into new discoveries in Louisiana, Alabama and Oklahoma.	   “It’s good for Ensign to expand their U.S. operations,” said Duncan Williams analyst Lewis Kreps, adding that the price Rowan is receiving for the rigs is “OK, and over $600 million would have been good.”	   Separately, Rowan said the deal, for which it expects to obtain regulatory approval within 60 days, also includes working capital of about $30 million.	   As of February, Rowan had 18 land rigs in Texas, eight in Louisiana, two in Oklahoma and one each in Alabama and Alaska. Its rigs are ideal for extended-reach drilling in shale fields such as the Haynesville, Deep Bossier and Eagle Ford — mostly oil rich.	   “While Ensign has historically been known to purchase assets at trough-of-cycle valuations, this is a unique opportunity to own a set of strong assets while expanding Ensign’s previously concentrated U.S. footprint into higher growth regions,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Michael Mazar said.	   As all of Rowan’s rigs are of over 1,500 horsepower, Ensign will be better equipped to compete with larger U.S.-based rivals like Nabors Industries and Patterson-UTI .	   Wednesday’s deal will take Ensign’s global drilling fleet to 340 marketed drilling rigs, with 115 rigs located in the United States.	   The transaction follows Rowan’s exit from onshore drilling business. It has already divested its drilling and mining gear unit to Joy Global to focus on the lucrative deepwater market. 	   “We expect that our after-tax proceeds, estimated at about $370 million, will be redeployed into our offshore drilling business and recently announced deepwater expansion,” Rowan Chief Executive Matt Ralls said.	   Jefferies & Co analyst Judson Bailey said that following Rowan’s sale of its land rigs “for a better-than-expected (price), its investors should begin to focus more on the undervalued nature of the company’s shares as well as its attractiveness as a takeover target”.	   Calgary, Alberta-based Ensign said the deal will be funded through its existing working capital, available credit lines and a new term facility of up to $400 million from HSBC.	   Goldman Sachs advised Houston-based Rowan on the deal.	   Ensign shares rose 3 percent to a near three-year high of C$19.95 in morning trading on Wednesday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.	   Shares of Rowan climbed 4 percent to a two-week high of $39.15 on the New York Stock Exchange.

22,HAL,UPDATE 3-Schlumberger says Kibsgaard to become CEO on Aug 1," * Kibsgaard appointed COO in February 2010   * Gould to retain chairmanship until April 2012   * Tony Isaac to become nonexecutive chairman next year   * Schlumberger shares up 1 pct ahead of results on Friday  (Adds analyst comment, background on new CEO, SAN FRANCISCO to dateline)   NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, July 21 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world’s largest oilfield services company, said on Thursday that Chief Operating Officer Paal Kibsgaard would succeed Andrew Gould as chief executive on Aug. 1.   Kibsgaard, a 43-year-old Norwegian, began his career with Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) in 1992 before joining Schlumberger in 1997 as a reservoir engineer in Saudi Arabia. He was formally introduced by Gould as the next CEO in February. [ID:nN23158951]   The succession has been closely watched since Gould has become one of the most respected leaders in the global energy industry after eight years as CEO and a 36-year career at a company, which has relationships with nearly every major oil producer.   The Briton is stepping down because he turns 65 at the end of this year. Since he took the helm in February 2003, Schlumberger’s shares have soared nearly 370 percent as the company expanded its services and geographic reach.   Simmons & Co analyst Bill Herbert said Gould did a fine job of purging the company of a litany of non-core businesses, while paying down debt and sharpening its strategic focus.   “The result has been to not only re-establish (Schlumberger) as the leading enterprise in the oil service industry, but as one of the leading enterprises in the global energy business,” Herbert wrote in a note to investors.   Kibsgaard, asked in February about what made him paranoid, said it was complacency within his company, which has a stock market value greater than rivals Halliburton Co (HAL.N), Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N and Weatherford Ltd (WFT.N) combined.   “If you are the leader in anything, and you think that staying the leader is easy and you can relax, that is a recipe for disaster,” Kibsgaard said.   Under Gould, Schlumberger has pushed to take a leading role in Iraq, where it is working with oil producers to return output to levels not seen in about a decade.   Gould will remain chairman until the annual shareholders meeting next April, when current lead independent director Tony Isaac will take over as the new nonexecutive  chairman.   Kibsgaard, who has held operational and management roles in the Middle East, Europe and the United States, became COO in February 2010 and was widely seen as the next CEO when Gould started discussing succession last October. [ID:nN22120005]   Schlumberger’s shares rose more than 1 percent to $89.35 in early trading on Thursday, in line with its rivals.

The government’s findings on the spill that killed 11 workers and ravaged the Gulf coast last summer has been widely anticipated by investors for clues on possible legal ramifications BP and its partners may face from the disaster.  The U.S. Coast Guard and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management was expected to release the results of their joint investigation next Wednesday, but the team said they need more time to “ensure that all evidence is properly weighed and considered.”  “The team is in the final stages of completing its report and expects to release it in the near future,” the investigative team said in a statement.

26,HAL,"Schlumberger quarterly results jump, shares rise","NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) beat estimates with a 64 percent jump in profit on strong U.S. demand and deepwater drilling, while international activity showed clear signs of improvement after a long wait.  Schlumberger shares rose 3 percent in early trading, as the world’s largest oilfield services company delivered its first set of market-pleasing results this year.  The stronger North American trend drove an estimate-beating 54 percent jump in earnings for rival Halliburton Co (HAL.N) this week, though Halliburton shares were little changed on Friday.  While half of Halliburton’s revenue comes from Canada and the United States, the region accounts for less than a third for Schlumberger, which sees big improvements elsewhere led by a dramatic increase in Saudi Arabian activity.  “None of the other countries are executing with the speed of Saudi. So yes, it’s going to come, but it’s not there yet,” Chief Executive Andrew Gould said on a call with analysts — his last before he retires as CEO and hands off the top job to 44-year-old Paal Kibsgaard.  Iraq is also a key factor in the improving international outlook, along with the North Sea and East Asia, he added.  Asked about Iraq, where many oil firms have found it hard to establish a foothold, Kibsgaard said it is likely to be Schlumberger’s seventh biggest out of 14 markets in the Middle East and Asia, before improving to No. 3 next year.  Oil and gas companies’ spending picked up far more quickly in North America than elsewhere this year as oil prices surged and producers rushed to tap fields rich in liquids.  Schlumberger said onshore U.S. strength and demand from the world’s deepwater regions drove second-quarter earnings, while Gulf of Mexico activity was improving after the drilling halt that followed last year’s BP Plc (BP.L) Macondo oil spill.  Second-quarter profit rose to $1.34 billion, or 98 cents a share, from $818 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier.  Leaving out one-time items, Schlumberger earned 87 cents a share from continuing operations, topping the analysts’ average forecast of 85 cents as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue rose 62 percent to $9.6 billion, topping the $9.2 billion that analysts had expected.  The strong North American performance offset disappointing earnings in Europe, the former Soviet states and the Middle East, UBS analyst Angie Sedita said, though she also saw high energy prices eventually driving those businesses as well.  “Schlumberger offers the best play on the international ... and deepwater markets, which should slowly start to improve later this year, with greater gains in 2012,” Sedita said in a note to investors.  Gould expressed optimism about deepwater in particular, a view supported by the dozens of new rigs in the pipeline.  “There have never been so many deepwater rigs on order. So to the extent that we have exploration success in deepwater ... I think that the exploration cycle can be a lot more sustained than it was last time, when it was abruptly terminated by the financial crisis and by the Macondo incident,” he said.  Gould also said the steep ramp-up in demand for services in the U.S. market and elsewhere is straining the sector, making it difficult to get equipment and staff to customers.

28,HAL,"Baker Hughes profit surges, but outshone by rivals","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oilfield service company Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N posted slightly better-than-expected quarterly earnings, driven by rising profit margins outside North America that offset some weakness closer to home.  North American results were hurt by the usual seasonal slowdown in Canada, where the spring snow melt hampers activity, and as many Gulf of Mexico rigs served by the world’s third-largest oilfield services company remained sidelined.  Baker Hughes shares were down 0.3 percent to $79.67 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.  Larger rivals Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Halliburton Co (HAL.N) delivered better-than-expected results last week, largely driven by a surge in U.S. activity.  “Although international revenue and margins beat our expectations, the bar may have been set too high in North America by some of Baker Hughes’ less Canadian-sensitive competitors,” analysts at Raymond James said.  High oil prices have prompted energy producers to boost activity in liquids-rich shale fields in the United States, driving up prices for pressure pumping and other activities.  Baker Hughes had a solid performance outside North America, with profit margins above 13 percent, or more than a percentage point up from last quarter and nearing its 15 percent year-end target. Chief Executive Chad Deaton said more international price rises would kick in over the quarters ahead.  “The momentum is definitely building, there is no doubt about it,” said Deaton, who could see the international margin recovery cap his seven-year stint as CEO when he steps down at the end of the year.  Second-quarter net profit rose to $338 million, or 77 cents a share, from $93 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items, Baker earned 93 cents a share, above the 91 cents that analysts, on average, expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue grew 41 percent to $4.74 billion, topping the $4.55 billion analysts expected.  While shares of Houston-based Baker Hughes dipped in afternoon trade, Halliburton rose 0.4 percent. Shares of Schlumberger, which has far more international exposure, added 1.2 percent.  The brightening oilfield outlook beyond the North American shale boom was underlined by analysts increasing estimates and price targets for Schlumberger. Dahlman Rose increased its price target for the industry leader to $124 from $116, while RBC Capital Markets bumped its target up to $113 from $110.  U.S.-traded shares of Weatherford International Ltd WFT.VX(WFT.N), which has aggressively geared up for more international growth, rose 1.5 percent ahead of its quarterly results on Tuesday.

30,HAL,Mexico's Pemex lines up debut private oil tenders," * Contracts for first oil fields to be awarded on Aug. 18   * 17 companies qualified for tender   * Contracts to drill in more-mature fields by end of year   By Mica Rosenberg and Adriana Barrera   MEXICO CITY, July 29 (Reuters) - Mexico’s state oil monopoly Pemex on Friday named the list of companies qualified to bid on the country’s first-ever oil field operating contracts in a historic auction to be held in mid-August.   The list of 17 companies includes global players like Halliburton Co (HAL.N), Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), Repsol (REP.MC) and Pacific Rubiales PRE.TO as well as some smaller operators.   Pemex wants private industry to help reactivate three small oil fields in southern Mexico, the first step toward opening up the nationalized energy sector.   The company hopes outside expertise and capital will help Mexico reverse a dramatic drop in oil output.   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   For Factbox on contract auction           [ID:nN27195636]   For story on Pemex’s Q2 results           [ID:nN1E76S0D5]   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Mexico, the world’s No. 7 oil producer, lost nearly a quarter of its production capacity between 2004 and 2009 because of aging oil fields and a lack of exploration.   Significant investment by foreigners has been barred in the past, protecting national pride around the country’s oil resources expropriated by the government in 1938.   But a 2008 oil reform allowed Pemex to offer more flexible contracts that incentivize production by offering bonuses when targets are exceeded.   The idea is to roll out auctions at mature fields first and then move on to more coveted exploration in deep waters.   Twenty-seven companies were interested in the tender for the Carrizo, Magallanes and Santuario fields, after more than 50 bought information packets.   Only 17 fulfilled all the requirements.   The winners will be chosen on Aug. 18 based on who can produce a barrel of oil most cost-effectively.   There is wide international interest from oil companies eager for more access to Mexico’s energy sector. Some remain wary of bureaucratic hurdles of working with the state behemoth but others have been impressed with the advances.   “Obviously there have been some problems, but in general I would say this has been the most orderly process for production and exploration contracting in Mexico’s history,” said David Enriquez, a lawyer for one of the firms in the contest.   “The companies are very happy with the timeframes and the level of information (being provided),” he said.   Mexico relies on oil revenues to fund around a third of its budget and Pemex often operates at a loss since the government gobbles up around half of its revenues. Rising oil prices have helped Pemex turn that trend around recently.   Two debt rating agencies downgraded Mexico in late 2009, citing its heavy reliance on the declining oil industry and a lack of political will to broaden the tax base.   Although Mexico’s oil output has stabilized around 2.6 million barrels per day, a renewed decline in production could one day force Mexico to become a net oil importer.   Bigger oil players like Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), BP Plc (BP.L) did not bid on the smaller fields but are likely watching how the process unfolds.   The three blocks total just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent, a fraction of Mexico’s proven reserves of 13.8 billion barrels.

31,HAL,Environmental groups press EPA on fracking fluid," *Environmental groups take new tact in fracking war   *Groups want EPA to force disclosure of chemicals   *Strong resistance expected from industry   By Lily Kuo   WASHINGTON, August 4  (Reuters) - Environmental and public health groups petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday to force U.S. oil and gas companies to disclose the chemicals used in natural gas drilling.   The petition signals a new tact by green groups in the fight between the booming U.S. natural gas industry and environmentalists who want more regulation of a controversial, but game-changing technology, hydraulic fracturing.   Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, involves blasting water treated with chemicals into the earth to release hard-to-reach shale gas.   Critics say use of the drilling technique has contaminated community water supplies and caused long-term health effects like cancer and organ damage.   The petition targets not just fracturing, which takes place after drilling, but the entire process including transport of gas and wastewater as well as fracking.   “What this petition is seeking to do is get the health and environmental data that we need so that we can really assess the risk,” said Deborah Goldberg, managing attorney of Earthjustice, a nonprofit law firm that is filing the petition on behalf of more than 100 environmental and public health groups.   The petition calls on the EPA to force manufacturers or distributors of chemicals used in oil and natural gas drilling, such as Halliburton (HAL.N), to disclose chemicals used as well as conduct toxicity tests.   By addressing the companies that make or sell the chemicals used, the petition pushes the EPA to sidestep a 2005 energy law that says only states can regulate fracturing done by drilling companies.   “We’re asking for things they clearly have the authority to do,” said Richard Denison, of the Environmental Defense Fund, in a news conference on Thursday.   The petition comes a day after the Environmental Working group issued a report that fracturing fluids contaminated a water well in West Virginia in 1987.   Industry leaders have long argued that fracking, which occurs far below water aquifers, has never contaminated water supplies.   If the EPA adopts the petition’s requests, it can expect strong resistance, petitioners said.   “From what I’ve seen in the past, there’s going to be a strong push-back to any change ... They’ve got things the way they want them,” said John Fenton an organizer from the Pavillion Wyoming Area of Concerned Citizens.   Efforts are further complicated by the fact that using natural gas, with its lower carbon footprint and domestic supply, is part of the Obama administration’s energy policy.   The EPA is conducting a study on how fracking could affect ground water supplies that is due out next year. The Energy Department advisory group is also examining safety practices of gas drilling.

The Canadian company expects high equipment utilization in western Canada and strong financial performance throughout the remainder of the year and into 2012 as a wet spring in western Canada delayed a lot of fracturing and coiled tubing work into the third and fourth quarters.	   Calfrac also raised its 2011 capital program by C$59 million to C$382 million ($396 million), of which C$38 million is expected to be spent in 2012.	   Despite North American seasonal slowdown in Canada, where the spring snow melt hampers activity, Calfrac posted a profit of C$12.1 million, or 27 Canadian cents a share, compared with a loss of C$10.3 million, or 24 Canadian cents a share, last year.	   Analysts, on average, had expected the company to post a loss of 8 Canadian cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	   The company, which gets more than 80 percent of its revenue from North America, benefited from high levels of pressure pumping activity in the unconventional oil and natural gas plays of western Canada and the United States.	   Revenue jumped 63 percent to C$269.5 million, ahead of estimates of C$215 million.	   In the April-June quarter, U.S. crude oil prices CLc1 soared 32 percent to average $103.49 a barrel.	   The company also expects crude oil and natural gas liquids prices to remain strong, which should assure expanded capital budgets at many of its customers.     	   Calfrac’s larger North America peers like Baker Hughes  , Schlumberger Ltd and Halliburton Co  have also posted strong profits.  	   Additionally, Calfrac, which has operations in Argentina, Russia, Mexico, said it plans to commence operations in Colombia during the second half of 2011.

33,HAL,U.S. fracking needs broad diesel oversight-lawmakers," * Lawmakers say narrow definition could lead to loophole  * Drilling practice mostly exempt from federal oversight  * Probe found drillers used diesel in fracking 2005-2009  By Ayesha Rascoe  WASHINGTON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers pressed the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday to adopt a broad definition of diesel for its upcoming guidance on use of the fuel in a natural gas drilling practice that critics say can taint water supplies.  The EPA is developing a framework to oversee the use of diesel in hydraulic fracturing, the only area where the practice is subject to federal oversight under the Safe Drinking Water Act.  A narrow definition of diesel fuel could provide drillers with a loophole that would allow them to use some forms of diesel containing toxic chemicals without obtaining a permit, the lawmakers warned in a letter.  “We urge you to craft a definition that provides consistency to industry while serving to protect public health and the environment,” said the letter, signed by House Democrats Henry Waxman, Edward Markey, Diana DeGette and Rush Holt.  Waxman, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, along with Markey and DeGette sponsored a probe that found 12 oil services firms, including Halliburton (HAL.N) and BJ Services BHI.N, injected millions of gallons of fluids containing the fuel into wells between 2005 and 2009. [ID:nN31240520]  Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, injects a mixture of water, sand and chemicals into rock formations at high pressure to force out oil and natural gas.  Innovations in the decades-old practice have allowed drillers to tap vast shale gas reserves that previously were out of reach.  But the spread of the technique to new areas has prompted a backlash from homeowners near shale gas developments who complain the practice has contaminated their drinking water.  Drillers say fracking is safe, noting that it is carried out thousands of feet (metres) below ground, much deeper than most water sources.  Seeking to allay public concerns, the Obama administration set up a panel to weigh in on what immediate steps are needed to improve the public and environmental safety of fracking. That panel’s initial report is due this week.

34,HAL,Marshall Islands report blames behavior for BP spill,"HOUSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Failure to react to repeated signs of problems with BP Plc’s Macondo oil well in the Gulf of Mexico and bypassing basic well control standards caused last year’s deadly blowout, the flag state for the drilling rig that exploded and sank said on Wednesday.  The Marshall Islands, where Transocean Ltd registered the doomed Deepwater Horizon rig, also said in a report on its investigation that failure to follow well abandonment plans approved by U.S. regulators played a part.  The rupture and explosion killed 11 workers and spewed more than 4 million barrels of crude into the Gulf in the worst-ever U.S. offshore oil spill.  The report did not specifically blame any of the companies involved, from well owner BP and driller Transocean to blowout preventer maker Cameron International Corp and well-sealing cement maker Halliburton.

36,HAL,UPDATE 2-Mexico's Pemex awards historic private oil contracts," * Pemex announces private operators of mature oil fields  * First incentive-based oil contracts in Mexico’s history  * Bigger companies eyeing potential deep water projects  (Updates with quotes, size of Petrofac investment)  By Mica Rosenberg and Luis Manuel Lopez  MEXICO CITY/VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Mexico’s state oil monopoly Pemex awarded its first-ever private oil-field operating contracts on Thursday as the company seeks to kick-start foreign investment in the nationalized energy sector.  British energy services firm Petrofac (PFC.L) won the right to operate two of the three mature oil fields up for grabs, and Mexico’s Administradora en Proyectos de Campos (APC) won the third.  Petrofac, which designs, builds and maintains facilities used in extracting and processing oil and gas, will be the first foreign company to operate fields in the world’s No. 7 oil producer in more than 70 years.  The new contracts are the fruit of 2008 reforms aimed at attracting more private investment into the lumbering oil industry to bring new dynamism to the sector.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Factbox on contract auction           [ID:nN1E77H0JS]  Story on Pemex’s Q2 results           [ID:nN1E76S0D5]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  The fields total only a small fraction of Mexico’s proven reserves of 13.8 billion barrels, but Pemex is hoping strong interest in other areas, especially deep-water contracts off the Gulf of Mexico planned for next year, will help reverse a slide in production.  “This is the beginning of a new phase. We want companies to help us exploit this resource by working hand-in-hand with us,” Pemex CEO Juan Jose Suarez Coppel said after the announcement.  “With more flexible contracts ... the potential is huge,” he added at the event held in the city of Villahermosa, Tabasco, an oil-producing state on the Gulf coast.  LESSONS LEARNED  More than 50 companies bought information packets about the Carrizo, Magallanes and Santuario fields in southern Mexico to get a peak at Pemex plans, twenty-seven made bids but only 17 fulfilled all the requirements.  Even companies that did not win the contracts said they were pleased with the process.  “This was a good start for Pemex ... we are hoping this will open doors for more companies to exploit these reserves that have been passed over,” said Manuel del Villar, the director of GPA Energy, which submitted a losing bid for the Santuario area.  “This is the first round, there will be others and we learned lessons,” he said.  Mexican oil output has fallen 24 percent since a 2004 peak of 3.4 million barrels per day and a renewed slide could one day force it to become a net crude importer.  Around a third of Mexico’s budget is funded by oil revenues so the decline in production has had serious implications for the country’s financial health and was one of the reasons behind a ratings downgrade in 2009.  Nationalized since 1938 and a large source of Mexican pride, Pemex [PEMEX.UL] has managed to stabilize oil output at around 2.6 million bpd and is aiming for 3 million bpd by 2015.  Pemex has not yet discussed private involvement in its largest oil fields, Cantarell and Ku Maloob Zaap, which make up more than half the country’s production. The company has sunk billions of dollars in the complicated Chicontepec project, but with disappointing results so far. [ID:nN1E77720E]  The three mature fields are currently producing nearly 15,000 barrels of oil per day, up from output last year, and the hope is to boost production to 55,000 bpd with the outside help, Pemex said in a statement on Thursday.  “We are sure that we will be able to significantly increase the recovery of these reserves for the benefit of all Mexicans,” Carlos Morales, head of Pemex upstream operations, said.  Global players like Halliburton Co (HAL.N), Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Repsol (REP.MC) had bid for the contracts, but were out-priced. The contracts were won by the companies offering to produce a barrel of oil at the lowest cost.  Petrofac, a FTSE 100 group, offered to produce crude for $5.01 per barrel in the Magallanes and Santuario fields, well below Pemex’s maximum. APC offered $5.03 per barrel for the Carrizo field.  Petrofac said it has committed to an investment of approximately $500 million.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded Petrofac stock to “buy” on Thursday but did not mention the Mexico contracts in its research note published before the announcement.

39,HAL,Halliburton sues BP for defamation over Gulf spill,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N) is suing BP Plc (BP.L) (BP.N) for “negligent misrepresentation, business disparagement and defamation” related to BP’s claims about who was to blame for last year’s Macondo oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.  Halliburton said BP provided inaccurate information prior to Halliburton carrying out its cementing services the day before the disaster, according to the lawsuit, which was filed in Texas state court.  Halliburton said BP knew or should have known about an additional hydrocarbon zone in the well and that the British company failed to tell Halliburton before it designed the cement program and then did not disclose it after the blowout.  “BP was solely responsible for identifying all hydrocarbon-bearing zones in the well and for identifying where the designed top of cement should be located in order to isolate all such zones,” Halliburton said in the lawsuit.  BP said it was reviewing the lawsuit and so could not comment in detail, but it noted investigators had found multiple parties responsible for the accident, including Halliburton, and that independent investigations identified “serious problems” with the cementing of the well.  BP and Transocean Ltd RIGN.VX (RIG.N), owner of the drilling rig that exploded and sank after the well blowout, are already locked in a legal battle over which company was at fault in the April 2010 disaster, which killed 11 workers and caused the worst offshore spill in U.S. history.  Halliburton, the world’s second-largest oilfield services provider, said on Friday it had also moved to amend its claims against BP in separate litigation in New Orleans to include fraud.  The Houston-based company said it was fully indemnified under its contract with BP because it had performed the cement work according to BP specifications.  In April, London-based BP sued Transocean, Halliburton and Cameron International CAM.N. Cameron made the blowout preventer for the well, a so-called fail-safe device that failed to automatically shut down the well.

41,HAL,Analysis: Damages ruling may be pivotal in BP case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A key court ruling in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill litigation could change the landscape in the massive case — encouraging more plaintiffs to sue, or spurring the parties to make a deal to resolve what could be a long string of trials over damages.  Last week, the judge overseeing a group of spill-related lawsuits against BP Plc and its business partners ruled that claims for punitive damages — not just compensatory damages — could be brought by fishermen and other plaintiffs alleging harm to physical property. If a jury ultimately awards these plaintiffs punitive damages, defendants could be forced to pay out big.  The ruling gives some potential plaintiffs more of an incentive to sue because of the possibility of higher damage awards, experts say. Some people have been on the fence about suing or seeking payouts from BP’s $20 billion victims’ compensation fund, which offers settlements as an alternative to litigation.  Also, the possibility of massive settlements to resolve the plaintiffs’ claims involving BP and other corporate defendants may now be more likely.  That is because tossing punitive damages into the legal mix tends to scare defendants. Punitive damages are awards that are often multiples of the amounts that plaintiffs are reimbursed for their losses. They are intended to punish defendants and prevent others from engaging in similar conduct.  The prospect of punitive damages of any size is a “potent inducement to settle,” said David Logan, dean of Roger Williams University School of Law in Bristol, Rhode Island.  Such claims can strengthen plaintiffs’ bargaining position in settlement negotiations by presenting an added risk for defendants, said Howard Erichson, an expert in complex litigation and a professor of law at Fordham University.  Neither BP nor the plaintiffs’ attorneys would comment on the possibility of a settlement before a liability trial is scheduled to begin in February 2012.  The February trial will decide who is to blame for the largest-ever U.S. offshore oil spill. If there are claims outstanding by the time that proceeding is done, multiple smaller trials will be scheduled to determine specific dollar amounts for damages.  The punitive damages ruling was handed down by Judge Carl Barbier of U.S. District Court in New Orleans, who will preside over the February trial.  In an emailed statement on Thursday, BP representative Daren Beaudo said: “The court’s decision builds on the earlier dismissal of several other types of plaintiffs’ claims. The court agreed with BP on several key issues, including dismissing plaintiffs’ state law claims, limiting availability of attorneys’ fees, and significantly narrowing the group of plaintiffs who are eligible to try to prove punitive damages.”  Co-defendants Transocean, Cameron, Anadarko and Halliburton declined to comment.  BP is sparring with its former business partners over the disaster. On Friday, Halliburton said it had moved to add fraud claims against BP in the federal multi-district litigation pending in New Orleans, and had also filed defamation and other claims against BP in Texas court. Halliburton handled cementing services on the blown-out Macondo well.  BP has been hit with unrelated legal woes in Russia, as special forces there raided its Moscow offices earlier this week in connection with legal action brought by minority shareholders in its Russian joint venture TNK-BP. BP said on Friday that the lawsuit was “absurd.”  In the U.S. oil spill litigation, the punitive damages ruling had been one of the major issues pending before Judge Barbier.  While the ruling largely benefits plaintiffs, it is not a straightforward victory for them, legal experts said. Barbier dismissed all claims brought under state law in the ruling, as well as general maritime negligence claims against Anadarko and MOEX, a unit of Japan’s Mitsui & Co Ltd.  Supreme Court decisions in the last decade could also serve to limit the size of punitive damages juries can award, said David Uhlmann, a professor of law at the University of Michigan. In the long-running Exxon Valdez case, the high court in 2008 ruled that punitive damages could not exceed the amount of compensatory damages awarded.  Also, it is not clear how much the ruling could translate into in dollar terms for the Gulf spill plaintiffs. Plaintiffs who say they suffered indirect losses — as opposed to fishermen and those with property damage — are not eligible for punitive damages. It is unknown how many of the 108,000 private claims before Barbier alleged such indirect losses, including restaurants and hotels claiming lost revenue as tourism fell.  Still, the prospect of winning punitive damages for clients could help plaintiffs’ lawyers bring more claims from property owners and fishermen, said Byron Stier, a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles.  “The punitive damages green light is huge,” Stier said. “That’s the threat to BP, and that’s what’s animating the plaintiffs’ lawyers.”  Plaintiffs’ lawyers are competing with the BP victims’ compensation fund, known as the Gulf Coast Claims Facility.  Lead plaintiffs’ lawyers in the litigation criticize the fund’s offers to settle with BP and other defendants in exchange for giving up the right to sue. They say claimants may be better-served in court. Kenneth Feinberg, who administers the fund, has said litigation will take years and could prove less generous than the fund.  If punitive damages are not limited by the Exxon precedent, the potential upside for some plaintiffs who choose to go to court is massive.  But if that is not the case, suing might not be victims’ best option, said Uhlmann, of the University of Michigan. Victims, he said, may do better turning to the settlement fund rather than “litigating for years and seeing most of the additional money paid to their attorneys under contingent fee arrangements.”  The case is In re: Oil Spill, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana, 2:10-md-02179.

Neither BP nor the plaintiffs’ attorneys would comment on the possibility of a settlement before a liability trial is scheduled to begin in February 2012.  The February trial will decide who is to blame for the largest-ever U.S. offshore oil spill. If there are claims outstanding by the time that proceeding is done, multiple smaller trials will be scheduled to determine specific dollar amounts for damages.  The punitive damages ruling was handed down by Judge Carl Barbier of U.S. District Court in New Orleans, who will preside over the February trial.  In an emailed statement on Thursday, BP representative Daren Beaudo said: “The court’s decision builds on the earlier dismissal of several other types of plaintiffs’ claims. The court agreed with BP on several key issues, including dismissing plaintiffs’ state law claims, limiting availability of attorneys’ fees, and significantly narrowing the group of plaintiffs who are eligible to try to prove punitive damages.”  Co-defendants Transocean, Cameron, Anadarko and Halliburton declined to comment.  BP is sparring with its former business partners over the disaster. On Friday, Halliburton said it had moved to add fraud claims against BP in the federal multi-district litigation pending in New Orleans, and had also filed defamation and other claims against BP in Texas court. Halliburton handled cementing services on the blown-out Macondo well.  BP has been hit with unrelated legal woes in Russia, as special forces there raided its Moscow offices earlier this week in connection with legal action brought by minority shareholders in its Russian joint venture TNK-BP. BP said on Friday that the lawsuit was “absurd.  In the U.S. oil spill litigation, the punitive damages ruling had been one of the major issues pending before Judge Barbier.  While the ruling largely benefits plaintiffs, it is not a straightforward victory for them, legal experts said. Barbier dismissed all claims brought under state law in the ruling, as well as general maritime negligence claims against Anadarko and MOEX, a unit of Japan’s Mitsui & Co Ltd.  Supreme Court decisions in the last decade could also serve to limit the size of punitive damages juries can award, said David Uhlmann, a professor of law at the University of Michigan. In the long-running Exxon Valdez case, the high court in 2008 ruled that punitive damages could not exceed the amount of compensatory damages awarded.  Also, it is not clear how much the ruling could translate into in dollar terms for the Gulf spill plaintiffs. Plaintiffs who say they suffered indirect losses — as opposed to fishermen and those with property damage — are not eligible for punitive damages. It is unknown how many of the 108,000 private claims before Barbier alleged such indirect losses, including restaurants and hotels claiming lost revenue as tourism fell.  Still, the prospect of winning punitive damages for clients could help plaintiffs’ lawyers bring more claims from property owners and fishermen, said Byron Stier, a professor at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles.  “The punitive damages green light is huge,” Stier said. “That’s the threat to BP, and that’s what’s animating the plaintiffs’ lawyers.”  Plaintiffs’ lawyers are competing with the BP victims’ compensation fund, known as the Gulf Coast Claims Facility.  Lead plaintiffs’ lawyers in the litigation criticize the fund’s offers to settle with BP and other defendants in exchange for giving up the right to sue. They say claimants may be better-served in court. Kenneth Feinberg, who administers the fund, has said litigation will take years and could prove less generous than the fund.  If punitive damages are not limited by the Exxon precedent, the potential upside for some plaintiffs who choose to go to court is massive.  But if that is not the case, suing might not be victims’ best option, said Uhlmann, of the University of Michigan. Victims, he said, may do better turning to the settlement fund rather than “litigating for years and seeing most of the additional money paid to their attorneys under contingent fee arrangements.”  The case is In re: Oil Spill, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana, 2:10-md-02179.

49,HAL,U.S. blames BP for Gulf spill,"WASHINGTON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - The United States heaped the lion’s share of blame for the country’s biggest ever offshore oil spill on BP on Wednesday as the government issued its final assessment of last year’s Gulf disaster.  In a report that may be pivotal in the multibillion-dollar legal battles to come and could set the stage for criminal charges, the Coast Guard and the offshore oil regulator said BP was solely to blame for 21 of 35 contributing causes to the Macondo well blow-out that led to the leak, and shared blame for eight more.  After the most definitive look yet at the disaster, investigators said BP focused excessively on containing costs and speeding up operations, and made a series of decisions that complicated cementing operations, which they said were the central cause of the disaster.  While the findings were broadly in line with several previous investigations, this report offered the most comprehensive glimpse into the government’s official view on the causes of the Gulf oil spill, including analysis of the recovered blowout preventer and violations of federal regulations by the companies involved with the well.  “BP’s cost or time saving decisions without considering contingencies and mitigation were contributing causes of the Macondo blowout,” the report said.  BP shares soared 5 percent on the day as investors viewed the findings as spreading responsibility more broadly. Shares of Halliburton — which was responsible for cementing — dipped 0.33 percent. Rig operator Transocean rallied more than 4 percent.  The report held no major surprises, said David Pursell, an analyst with energy investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt & Co in Houston, but it “very much points a finger at BP more clearly than I would have expected.”  “What they’re saying is, it’s BP’s well. Transocean may have made some mistakes, but part of that was because BP didn’t tell them or communicate to them about increasing operational risks. BP is the operator of the well, it’s their responsibility,” Pursell said.  Investors will now turn their attention to the courts, where numerous cases pitting the companies against each other, the public and the government could drag out for years.  Each company involved found some reason for validation in the report.  Transocean said the report “finally puts to rest all previous allegations that improper maintenance of the blowout preventer contributed to the tragedy”.  Halliburton said the report “accurately places responsibility on BP”, which it said was responsible for all the operational decisions in the contributing causes.  BP said it agreed “with the report’s core conclusion — consistent with every other official investigation — that the Deepwater Horizon accident was the result of multiple causes, involving multiple parties, including Transocean and Halliburton”.  The report highlighted a litany of errors that preceded last year’s explosion on the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 workers and spewed more than 4 million barrels of oil from the Macondo well into the sea.  BP failed to communicate decisions regarding the cementing that increased operational risks to Transocean, the contractor that owned and operated Deepwater Horizon, according to the report.  The cement’s failure to maintain the integrity of the well was the central cause of the blowout.  BP worked with Halliburton to design the cement job. Because the well was over budget, “BP sought to minimize these losses by reducing the volume of cement it pumped into the well” and a key analysis recommended by a Halliburton engineer was skipped, according to the report.  The Justice Department has already sued the well’s owners, BP, Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Mitsui & Co, as well as Transocean.  Those civil claims are before a federal court in New Orleans, where a trial allocating blame for the spill was scheduled to begin in February.  More charges could be brought, legal experts said.  “Today’s report increases the likelihood that BP, Transocean, and Halliburton will face criminal charges for their roles in causing the Gulf oil spill,” said David Uhlmann, a professor at University of Michigan Law School and formerly the top environmental crimes prosecutor for the Justice Department.  In June 2010, U.S. attorney-general Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department had opened criminal and civil investigations into the causes of the disaster.

Transocean said the report “finally puts to rest all previous allegations that improper maintenance of the blowout preventer contributed to the tragedy”.  Halliburton said the report “accurately places responsibility on BP”, which it said was responsible for all the operational decisions in the contributing causes.  BP said it agreed “with the report’s core conclusion — consistent with every other official investigation — that the Deepwater Horizon accident was the result of multiple causes, involving multiple parties, including Transocean and Halliburton”.  The report highlighted a litany of errors that preceded last year’s explosion on the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 workers and spewed more than 4 million barrels of oil from the Macondo well into the sea.  BP failed to communicate decisions regarding the cementing that increased operational risks to Transocean, the contractor that owned and operated Deepwater Horizon, according to the report.  The cement’s failure to maintain the integrity of the well was the central cause of the blowout.  BP worked with Halliburton to design the cement job. Because the well was over budget, “BP sought to minimize these losses by reducing the volume of cement it pumped into the well” and a key analysis recommended by a Halliburton engineer was skipped, according to the report.  LEGAL IMPLICATIONS  The Justice Department has already sued the well’s owners, BP, Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) and Mitsui & Co (8031.T), as well as Transocean. [ID:nN16216485]  Those civil claims are before a federal court in New Orleans, where a trial allocating blame for the spill was scheduled to begin in February.  More charges could be brought, legal experts said.  “Today’s report increases the likelihood that BP, Transocean, and Halliburton will face criminal charges for their roles in causing the Gulf oil spill,” said David Uhlmann, a professor at University of Michigan Law School and formerly the top environmental crimes prosecutor for the Justice Department.  In June 2010, U.S. attorney-general Eric Holder announced that the Justice Department had opened criminal and civil investigations into the causes of the disaster.

54,HAL,UPDATE 1-Release of key BP oil spill probe expected soon," * Probe will spread blame to BP, contractors-report   * Release of BP oil spill report imminent - official   * Other probes have blamed accident on series of mistakes   * Report to help guide future drilling regulations  (Recasts, adds details from Wall Street Journal report)   By Ayesha Rascoe   WASHINGTON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - A U.S. government team investigating last year’s massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill will blame BP (BP.L) and its contractors for mistakes that led to the disaster in a report expected out as early as Wednesday, according to the Wall Street Journal.   The final report from U.S. Coast Guard and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) investigators has been heavily anticipated by investors eager for clues on possible legal ramifications BP and its partners may face from the drilling disaster.   The results of the investigation will echo previous probes of the Gulf oil spill, faulting BP for seeking to save time and money without considering the safety ramifications, the Journal said.   The report will also blame Transocean  RIGN.VX, the contractor that owned and operated the Deepwater Horizon rig, for continuing work on the well after encountering multiple hazards, the newspaper said.    The investigative team has declined to say when the report, which was initially supposed to be released earlier this year, will officially be issued.   But BOEM chief Michael Bromwich said on Tuesday the team was in the “final stages” of completing its investigation and the release of the report was “imminent.”   A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that the report could be released some time on Wednesday.   Last year’s explosion on the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 workers and spewed more than 4 million barrels of oil from the Macondo well into the sea.   The drilling disaster spurred a slew of investigations, lawsuits and regulatory reforms.   The Justice Department has already sued the well’s owners, BP, Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) and Mitsui Co Ltd, as well as Transocean. [ID:nN16216485]   More charges could be brought, however, and the findings from federal investigators could provide fodder for lawsuits that BP and its contractors have filed blaming each other for the biggest offshore oil spill in U.S. history.   Other official investigations of the spill have blamed the catastrophe on a series of mistakes made by BP and its partners.   Probes conducted by a presidential commission and the National Academies have said one key mistake was the rig crew’s decision to move ahead with the abandonment of the well despite tests that indicated problems with the well’s integrity.   The presidential commission also blamed contractor Halliburton (HAL.N) for faulty cementing on the well.   The Coast Guard also released a draft report in April citing serious safety lapses in the lead up to the accident by Transocean, which as the owner the oil rig, falls under the USCG’s jurisdiction. [ID:nN24172462]   Both Halliburton and Transocean strongly dispute these findings, however.   Unlike some of the earlier probes, the report from the Coast Guard and BOEM will include findings about Macondo’s blowout preventer, which was supposed act as a last line of defense against a major spill.   A forensic review commissioned by the federal team found that an off-center pipe stopped the device from operating properly. [ID:nN04251695]   In addition to the legal impacts of the federal report, the team’s investigation may lead to further changes in the regulatory landscape for offshore drilling.   Following the Gulf spill, the government imposed a raft a new rules aimed at preventing another disaster and began a complete reorganization of the scandal-prone offshore drilling agency, which was then known as the Minerals Management Service.   The new rules, coupled with a temporary moratorium on deepwater oil exploration, slowed oil and gas development in the Gulf significantly.   Oil drilling activity is picking back up in the region, with 20 deepwater floaters drilling in area, up from 4 at this point last year, according to a Barclays Capital Research note.   Bromwich said the team’s findings would help guide future regulatory efforts for his agency, but he does not anticipate the report will call for any immediate changes in drilling rules.

55,HAL,Analysis: BP oil spill report may prompt $30 billion pay-out,"By Tom Bergin - Analysis  LONDON (Reuters) - Findings of the second major investigation by the U.S. government into the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, may press BP into putting over $30 billion on the table to quickly settle its outstanding legal headaches.  The report, released on Wednesday, was even more damning of BP’s behavior than the Presidential panel’s findings, which were issued in January and February. Both reports also highlighted mistakes made by BP’s contractors, driller Transocean and cement specialist Halliburton.  The investigations have not left London-based BP eager to face the Department of Justice or civil claimants in court.  “We would like everything settled as soon as we can, otherwise you have lingering reputation issues and investor uncertainty,” one insider said after the latest report.  BP declined to comment on its legal strategy.  Companies often drag out litigation, as payments in the future have less value than payments now.  Exxon Mobil fought claims related to the 1989 Valdez spill for almost 20 years, confident it could beat down the massive sums sought by, and initially awarded to, its opponents. In the end, it was largely successful.  But BP’s case is not seen to be as strong. The Valdez spill happened when a drunk captain guided his tanker onto a reef, while the official investigations put most of the blame for Macondo on BP management structures and decisions.  The man hearing the civil damages claims against BP, Judge Carl Barbier, has set a February trial date. BP is likely to make a “significant” offer soon afterwards, the insider said.  “I expect that early next year you will see the mother of all settlements,” another source close to the company said.  BP estimates the cost of the oil spill will end up at around $42 billion, including all environmental costs, compensation, legal claims and fines. So far, it has spent around $25 billion.  It has paid around $7 billion to compensate fishermen, hoteliers and cruise ship owners, mainly through the $20 billion fund it created under President Barack Obama’s direction, and expects to pay out another $7.4 billion, according to its regulatory filings.  Lawyer Brent Coon, who is representing some of the claimants, says that from what he has seen, actual economic damages could be much higher.  “So far they’ve been handling mainly the smaller cases.”  Coon sees BP being forced to pay out another $10-20 billion to cover economic claims. Some legal experts believe the total could even be much higher.  BP’s provision also includes $3.5 billion related to Clean Water Act fines. But if BP is found to have been grossly negligent, which it denies, it could be fined over $21 billion.  Even before the conclusion of the highly critical official investigations, the government indicated it would press for the higher level of fines associated with gross negligence.  However, the oil industry lobby’s growing strength in recent months, combined with the Obama administration’s wish to see the case resolved well before presidential elections in November 2012 could mean the DoJ accepts a discount to the maximum fine.  Nonetheless, a fine of over $10 billion is possible, lawyers say.  BP’s provision also excludes punitive damages but Judge Barbier has ruled these can be claimed, at least in relation to maritime-related cases, such as losses by fishermen, which Coon estimated at around $5 billion.  While recent awards have generally seen punitive damages awarded at levels equal to or less than actual economic damages, Zygmunt Plater, Professor at the Boston College Law school, said claimants could receive a multiple of any compensatory award because the latest government report linked the accident to BP’s cost-cutting efforts.  Even at a 1:1 punitive-to-economic damage ratio, BP may have to offer an additional $5 billion to cover punitive awards.  Combined, it appears BP may have to put over $30 billion on the table to cover the DoJ and civil claimant cases against it — some $20 billion above what it has budgeted for.  Plater, however, said the risk of a court awarding much more meant that if BP could put all criminal and civil cases against it to rest for $40 billion, it should jump at the chance.  Such sums are substantial even for a company with a market capitalization of $114 billion.  BP’s share price, which has failed to rebound since the well was capped, is already factoring in a bigger final bill.  Analysts said the discount to rivals suggests investors are pricing in pre-tax costs, above what has already been spent, of around $60 billion.  “The key issue in the BP investment case is the resolution of the Macondo liability,” UBS analysts said in a research note this week.  “We believe this will be critical in derisking the valuation of BP, freeing management to address strategic challenges.”  Nonetheless, BP insiders say the company is not willing to offer any amount to win legal peace.  A third source familiar with the company’s thinking said the period around February could represent a window for cutting deals, but that if claimants were not “reasonable,” the company could take the Exxon route and litigate for ten or 20 years.

56,HAL,Santos to begin drilling in Bangladesh sea," DHAKA, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Australian oil and energy firm Santos will begin drilling in the coastal waters off Bangladesh this week to explore hydrocarbon, a significant development in the sector, a senior official said on Sunday.	   “We have agreed to allow the firm to sell its product from the new offshore structures directly to private buyers at market price,” said Mohammad Hussain Monsur, chairman of the state-run Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation, or Petrobangla.	   He told Reuters that Santos would drill in block 16 in the Bay of Bengal, Chittagong.	   John Chambers, president of Santos in Bangladesh, told Reuters it would invest $126 million for a three-well programme.	   “The mobilisation of this drilling rig is a major milestone for Santos in Bangladesh,” Chambers said.	   He added the drilling is targeting new reservoirs identified following 3D seismic studies during 2010.	   Santos first came to Bangladesh in 2007 when it acquired interests in block 16 (Sangu) and block 16 (Exploration) from Cairn Energy , then the operator. 	   Today, the participants in block 16 (Sangu) are Santos with 75 percent and U.S.-based Halliburton on 25 percent while Santos has all of block 16 (Exploration).	   Santos has received expressions of interest from large privately owned industries in Chittagong that are willing to buy gas from its offshore fields in Bangladesh at market price, including fertiliser factories and power plants.   The country requires new energy sources. Petrobangla forecasts the country’s gas reserves will run out by 2015 at the current consumption rate.

57,HAL,UPDATE 2-Chesapeake forms oilfield services subsidiary," * Sees valuation up to $10 billion   * Boots & Coots exec named CEO   * Unit formed ahead of IPO, other move  (Adds byline, analyst comment)   By Anna Driver   Sept 19 (Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N), the second-largest U.S producer of natural gas, said on Monday it formed an oilfield services subsidiary in a step ahead of a possible public offering or other means of wringing value from the assets.   Chesapeake also named Jerry Winchester, the 52-year-old former chief executive officer of Boots & Coots International Well Control Inc as CEO of the new unit. Boots & Coots was acquired by Halliburton Co (HAL.N) last year.   “This is one more step taken ahead of monetizing this business,” John Abbott, an analyst at Pritchard Capital Partners, said. “They’ve talked about this thing being valued at $7 billion, but the question is, how do you make the market realize that value?”   In addition to an initial public offering, Chesapeake may also consider a partial spin-off of its services business, the analyst said.   Chesapeake said it believes its oilfield service business will be worth as much as $10 billion in 2012.   Chesapeake, which has been building its drilling rig, hydraulic fracturing and other services in recent months through investments and acquisitions, said the new unit will be called Chesapeake Oilfield Services LLC.   Chesapeake, one of the most active drillers in the United States, said the new unit will be a hedge against oilfield inflation and provide services to the company’s exploration and production company at low prices.   Pritchard Capital has assigned a value of $6.9 billion to Chesapeake’s oilfield assets, Abbott said.   Shares of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma-based Chesapeake fell $1.24, or nearly 4 percent in morning New York Stock Exchange trading to $30.58.  (Reporting by Anna Driver in Houston, editing by Gerald E.

58,HAL,BP oil spill poses long-term threat - US study," MOBILE, Ala., Sept 20 (Reuters) - Oil mats submerged in the seabed more than a year after the biggest oil spill in U.S. history pose a long-term threat to coastal ecosystems across the northern Gulf of Mexico, according to Auburn University researchers.   A study released on Tuesday by the school’s engineering department showed that tar balls churned to the surface by Tropical Storm Lee and deposited along Alabama beaches this month had “essentially identical” chemical composition as samples taken from mats after the BP Plc (BP.L) (BP.N) oil spill from the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig blowout.   The civil engineering study — conducted before, during and after the tropical storm’s landfall on Alabama beaches — indicated the spill’s remnants were largely unchanged 17 months after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded and sank off the coast of Louisiana.   The data directly linked the recently deposited tar balls to the 2010 spill of more than 200 million gallons of oil.   “The data question the validity of the widely held belief that submerged oil from the Deepwater Horizon accident is substantially weathered and thus depleted of most polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,” the study said.   “Also, it supports the hypothesis that submerged oil may continue to pose some level of long-term risk to nearshore ecosystems,” it said.   BP spokesman Scott Dean said the Auburn research has not had any immediate effect on the oil company’s ongoing response to the spill.   “We’re looking at the study, but it doesn’t change our commitment to the response,” Dean said. “We’ll continue to have crews out collecting tar balls as the reports come in.”   BP said it sent teams to assess the clean-up to the affected areas after Tropical Storm Lee and provided additional cleanup crews.

59,HAL,Lack of sand helps explain well costs gap -Kodiak," * Kodiak at $9.5 mln per well vs $6 mln each for Whiting   * Flooding delayed shipment of sand for fracking -Abraxas   SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 26 (Reuters) - A big difference in well expenses around North Dakota’s shale is largely due to variable costs of a key ingredient in the hydraulic fracturing process, the CEO of Kodiak Oil & Gas Corp KOG.N said on Monday.   Sand is a common “proppant” used to keep fractures in shale rock open after a frac job is complete. But a pricier ceramic substitute, such as that made by Carbo Ceramics Inc (CRR.N), is used in its place to varying degrees, depending on either the nature of the well or the availability of sand.   Executives say getting their hands on sand in North Dakota’s remote Bakken shale region can be hard, while a wider U.S. fracking boom in some cases has led to shortages of the stuff that cannot be easily resolved. [ID:nS1E78E1GZ]   Kodiak CEO Lynn Peterson said much of the difference between his company’s $9.5 million per-well cost in North Dakota and the $6 million of Whiting Petroleum Corp (WLL.N) had to do with Whiting’s greater use of sand.   Peterson also said trucking costs in the region contributed to inflation in the oil-rich region, which saw a surge in activity as crude oil jumped to as high as $100 per barrel.   “Some of these costs, quite frankly, have gotten out of control,” he told investors at a conference hosted by the Independent Petroleum Association of America.   Peterson said the problem with trucking costs would be solved once more infrastructure was built in the area, which he believed could not handle many more trucks.   As for the ceramics mix, Abraxas Petroleum Corp (AXAS.O) CEO Robert Watson said he aimed to use an average of 40 percent ceramics on Bakken wells. But on a recent well, Abraxas was forced to inject 60 percent ceramics because flooding had prevented a shipment of sand from arriving in the region.   Whiting believes it is the largest customer for Halliburton Co’s (HAL.N) white sand in the region, since it has their crews committed to its wells, Whiting CEO James Volker told Reuters on the sidelines of the IPAA conference in San Francisco.   At $6 million per well, and $80-per-barrel oil, he told investors that Whiting could expect at least a 3-to-1 return.

60,HAL,"UPDATE 1-KBR settles Brazil bolts dispute, Halliburton pays"," * Dispute over faulty bolts on subsea oilfield flowlines   * Halliburton covers $200 mln settlement for former unit   Sept 27 (Reuters) - U.S. engineering company KBR Inc (KBR.N) has ended a five-year dispute over failed bolts on subsea oilfield flowlines off the coast of Brazil, settling for $200 million to be paid by former parent Halliburton Co (HAL.N).   KBR said on Tuesday it was notified late last week of the award in favor of Barracuda & Caratinga Leasing Co, controlled by Brazilian state oil giant Petrobras (PETR4.SA).   According to filings with regulators, Petrobras asked KBR to replace certain subsea flowline bolts that failed through mid-November 2005 and later replaced other bolts on its own.   In March 2006, Petrobras said it submitted the matter for arbitration in New York under the guidelines of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.   The $2.5 billion Barracuda-Caratinga contract given to KBR had included construction of 54 wells and related equipment, as well as the start-up and operations support for the fields.   The award of about $200 million includes the estimated costs for bolt replacement and costs incurred by Barracuda in the arbitration. Under their 2007 separation, Halliburton Co agreed to shoulder any Barracuda-Caratinga costs.   Halliburton, the world’s second-largest oilfield services company, has now cleared another large KBR-related liability, given that KBR settled with Britain’s Serious Fraud Office in February over a Nigerian bribery case. [ID:nLDE71F2FD]   In July, a Texas jury rejected claims brought by a woman who said she was raped by fellow employees while working for KBR in Iraq six years ago.

According to the U.S.-based Energy Information Administration, Ukraine has Europe’s fourth-largest shale gas reserves at 42 trillion cubic feet (1.2 trillion cubic metres), trailing Poland, France and Norway.	   The former Soviet republic is keen to boost domestic gas output to ease its dependence on Russia which has led to frequent rows over price in the last few years.	   Naftogaz did not disclose any details of its agreement with ExxonMobil, which is an active shale gas player in neighbouring Poland. Last month, Ukraine said it would sign a $800 million shale gas deal with Shell (RDSa.L).	   Naftogaz said it had also signed a cooperation agreement with Total on potential Black Sea shelf gas exploration and a service deal with Halliburton .	   In January 2009, a pricing row between Moscow and Kiev resulted in the stoppage of Russian gas flows to Europe for about two weeks, tarnishing Moscow’s image as a reliable exporter and spurring a European quest for new suppliers.

64,HAL,FACTBOX-Key political risks to watch in Ecuador," QUITO, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The implementation of contentious justice reforms, tensions between the government and the media, and talks aimed at patching up relations with the United States are key issues to watch in Ecuador.   Leftist President Rafael Correa won a May 7 referendum on 10 reforms to overhaul the justice system and limit media ownership, as well as to ban activities such as bullfighting and gambling in casinos.   He argues the judicial overhaul is key to tackling crime, the number one worry of Ecuadoreans. But opposition leaders say the reforms are designed to give Correa more control over judicial appointments.   In early September, Correa declared a 60-day judicial “emergency” to ensure legal services while the justice system is overhauled. [ID:nN1E78410H] A process to select the members of Ecuador’s supreme court has started and should last a few weeks.   Three of the 10 reforms have to be ratified by lawmakers, and the ruling Alianza Pais coalition is scrambling to win support for them since it does not control Congress.   Lawmakers passed an anti-monopoly law in late September creating watchdogs that will control prices and foster competition. The law also bans bankers from having investments in other industries, including the media.   Ecuador sentenced three newspaper directors and a former columnist to jail in July, and fined them and the paper $40 million for libeling Correa, prompting widespread condemnation from rights groups. [ID:nN1E76K1YF]   Correa has accused the media of being corrupt and calls them “the real opposition,” while news outlets accuse the president of trying to silence media critics.   Congress is expected to pass a bill in the next few weeks to create a media watchdog that critics fear will be used to censor journalists.   Correa is part of a South American leftist alliance that includes presidents Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Evo Morales of Bolivia, who have changed laws to boost their power and have also been accused of stifling media freedom.   What to watch:   — Worsening tensions between Correa and the media.   — Congress passing the controversial media reform bill.   Violent police protests rocked Correa’s government last year, reviving memories of Ecuador’s volatile history. He called them an attempted coup. [ID:nN30130945]   The government’s relations with the police remain tense and it has announced a plan to subject hundreds of policemen to lie detector tests to find out if they are involved in corruption or criminal activities.   Ecuador’s military calls the shots during crises and the police mutiny was no exception. Correa appears to have promised the military new equipment, but the soldiers’ assertiveness may also temper some of his policies, or undermine stability.   Three presidents were ousted in the decade before Correa took office in 2007. The military often played a critical role by refusing to assist the leaders being buffeted by protests.   What to watch:   — Government shelving plans to subject police to lie detectors.   — Police announcing internal changes to prevent the government from ordering a clean up.   After excluding itself from debt markets by defaulting on $3.2 billion in global bonds three years ago, Ecuador has met funding needs with bilateral credit deals, mostly from China.   Ecuador signed a $2 billion credit deal with China in late June and and is in final talks with a Chinese bank for a $571 million loan, which would take debt commitments to China to around $7.3 billion, including loans, advance payments for oil sales, and energy project financing. [ID:nN1E75Q1PC]   The government last month launched a bid to attract foreign investment for a plan to spend $8 billion in infrastructure, including roads, ports and airports. [ID:nS1E78J1TE]   Increased investments helped Ecuador’s economy grow 8.9 percent in the second quarter versus the same period last year, and it is on track to meet its 5.2 percent growth target for 2011. [ID:nS1E78S16R]   Ecuador may return to international debt markets with a bond issue in 2012, but past defaults, instability and Correa’s tempestuous relationship with the private sector mean it may have to pay very high yields. [ID:nN22115400]   The government expects $7 billion in mining investments in the next few years, and officials have been in talks for months with miners aiming to develop large projects.   Correa said in August that the negotiations with the mining firms were “really hard,” in part because the government was demanding an 8 percent royalty payment while foreign investors were offering to pay 6 percent. [ID:nN1E77223Y]   Oil companies including Schlumberger (SLB.N), Halliburton (HAL.N) and Baker & Hughes BHI.N are in talks over $1.5 billion in investments to increase output in four large mature oil fields controlled by state-run oil company Petroecuador.   Ecuador has offered $168 million to Brazilian oil company Petrobras for its assets in the country, which were nationalized after Petrobras refused to sign a new contract giving the state a larger share of its revenue. Petrobras is reportedly seeking $300 million for its Ecuador unit.   What to watch:   — Petrobras may seek international arbitration.   — Government could increase pressure on miners.   A judge ordered Chevron (CVX.N) in February to pay $8.6 billion to clean up pollution at old drilling sites in the Amazon. Chevron denies the charges, and the 17-year-old legal saga looks far from over as both sides appeal. [ID:nN25225194]   A U.S. judge later froze the enforcement of the ruling outside Ecuador, but in mid-September an appeals court reversed the order, although the plaintiffs promised not to seek enforcement until their appeal process in Ecuador is completed. [ID:nS1E78I21W]   Correa expelled the U.S. ambassador in April over U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks that suggested Correa was aware of the corrupt police practices. [ID:nN05119498]   Washington responded by expelling Ecuador’s envoy, but Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said late last month that relations are on the mend and that both countries have appointed ambassadors, although the appointments still need to be ratified. [ID:nS1E78L00H]   Speculation is rife in Ecuador that the friction could prompt U.S. lawmakers not to renew a regional trade preferences deal that expired in February.   What to watch:   — Further legal rulings and moves in the Chevron case.   — U.S., Ecuador may ratify ambassadors in their posts.

65,HAL,U.S. to regulate contractors of offshore oil firms," * Says can keep current pace of issues of deepwater permits   * Cannot deliver drilling permits faster with current resources    By Gwladys Fouche	   STAVANGER, Norway, Oct 4 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities are looking to regulate the contractors of oil companies that work offshore in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, a senior federal official said on Tuesday.	   “We will regulate contractors as well as operators. There is no compelling reason or logic not to do so,” Michael Bromwich, director of the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, told an oil conference.	   The agency is responsible for overseeing the development of energy and mineral resources off the coast of the United States as the successor of the much criticised Minerals Management Service.	   During last year’s BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the role of contractors Halliburton , in charge of the cementing in the Macondo well, and Transocean , which operated the Deepwater Horizon rig, came into sharp focus in addition to the role the BP played as operator.	   Under current practice U.S. regulators turn mainly to the operator as the company accountable for all offshore operations.	   “There is a virtue in the administrative clarity in going only against the operators and not confusing the picture,” Bromwich told reporters after his speech. 	   “But in those instances when the violations by contractors are bad enough ... we should go after them as well,” he said, adding that this would affect only contractors that are involved in the development of offshore oil and gas leases. 	   Bromwich added that he had asked the bureau’s lawyers to examine whether it had the legal authority to go after contractors.	   “The lawyers said there was no doubt that we had the legal authority to do it. The question then became whether it was appropriate to do it, and I concluded that it certainly is.”	   Since February the bureau has delivered some 143 permits for 41 deepwater wells requiring subsea containment after U.S. authorities introduced more safety requirements in the wake of the BP oil spill. 	   Several permits can be submitted for one well.	   Many oil and gas companies have complained that drilling activities in the Gulf of Mexico are not picking up fast enough because permits are being delivered too slowly.	   Bromwich said the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management could keep to its current pace but could not go faster due to limited resources.	   Asked whether the current pace was sustainable, he said: “I think so ... I think we are on a pretty good path right now.	   “People have complained that it is not consistent with the historical pace,” he said. “We have a whole new set of regulations that the operators need to comply with before they submit their applications. 	   “Our personnel need to confirm that they are complying, and that process takes longer than it took in the past.” 	   Asked whether he could accelerate the pace, Bromwich said: “Not without additional resources, we can’t.” 	 	  (editing by Jane Baird)	  ",10042011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oilsafety/u-s-to-regulate-contractors-of-offshore-oil-firms-idUSL5E7L433M20111004
66,HAL,"UPDATE 2-U.S. sanctions BP, contractors for Gulf oil spill","* US issues 15 notices of violations for spill * First time sanctions issued against contractors * Face fines of up to $35,000 a day, per incident By Ayesha Rascoe WASHINGTON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. offshore drilling regulator on Wednesday formally issued sanctions against BP and the major contractors involved in the 2010 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig that killed 11 workers and spewed more than 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The newly formed Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement filed 15 “incidents of noncompliance” (INCs) to the companies. It did not release details of how much the companies may face in fines. By law, the companies face fines of up to $35,000 a day, per incident for the violations. In its final report on the accident issued last month the Interior Department outlined infractions committed by the companies. BP, owner of the ruptured Macondo well, received the lion’s share of the sanctions, with seven notices for violations ranging from failure to protect health and property to failing to keep the well under control at all times. In a first for the department, BP’s contractors Transocean , which owned the Deepwater Horizon rig, and Halliburton , which carried out cementing on the well, also face sanctions. The contractors each received four notices of violations, with Transocean accused of failing to properly maintain the rig’s blowout preventer and Halliburton accused of not properly cementing the well. All three companies have 60 days to appeal the sanctions. The agency said it will consider imposing civil penalties for the notices once the appeal period has ended. Any fines imposed by the drilling agency would be separate from the ongoing Justice Department lawsuits against BP and Transocean. A Transocean spokesman said the company does plan to appeal its sanctions. BP said it has taken steps to enhance safety and the sanctions show that its contractors also played a role in the spill. “We continue to encourage other parties, including Transocean and Halliburton, to acknowledge their responsibilities in the accident,” BP said in a statement. BP and its contractors are embroiled in various lawsuits blaming each other for the spill. Halliburton did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Traditionally, the department has only gone after well operators for rule infractions. But after last year’s spill, the department has asserted that it has authority to regulate contractors. The decision to sanction Transocean and Halliburton reflects the “severity of the incident” and the department’s commitment to holding all parties accountable, the regulator said. “The joint investigation clearly revealed the violation of numerous federal regulations designed to protect the integrity of offshore operations; these INCs are the next step in vindicating the regulatory program designed to protect the interests of the public,” BSEE Director Michael Bromwich said in a statement. Executives from the three companies and officials from the drilling agency are set to testify at a House Natural Resources committee hearing on Thursday about the government’s probe of the Gulf spill.

70,HAL,"Halliburton Q3 beats, modest tone weighs on shares","(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the world’s second-largest oilfield services company, posted a higher-than-expected profit, but its stock reversed Friday’s gain due to the less exuberant outlook of its management. Chief Executive Dave Lesar talked of the risk of decreased U.S. gas-directed drilling, and expected some rigs to be redeployed to liquids-rich regions, though he also noted such shifts can weigh on efficiency and financial performance. Kurt Hallead, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, pointed to the executives’ discussion of flat international pricing against seasonal weakness in North America as indicating fourth-quarter profit estimates would need to be trimmed from the current average of $1.03 per share. Halliburton’s profit surge in the past year has been driven by the need for drillers to tap its hydraulic fracturing expertise to extract oil and gas from U.S. shale rock “The bear case mentality is that U.S. fracking has peaked,” Hallead said of what investors had to consider when buying the stock at this point in the cycle. After a rally on Friday, Halliburton shares fell as much as 7.8 percent on Monday, despite another strong quarterly performance. Third-quarter net profit rose to $683 million, or 74 cents per share, from $544 million or 60 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Halliburton earned 94 cents per share, topping analysts’ average estimate of 92 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 40 percent to $6.55 billion. Analysts had expected $6.39 billion. Many analysts expect the North American shale boom to last at least through 2012, even with the weak American economy, as producers plow billions of dollars into developing U.S. oil shale fields. Lesar said Halliburton expects to have hired 17,000 people this year, including 12,000 in the United States, implying an increase in its worldwide headcount to about 77,000. While acknowledging some clients may cut back on spending, Lesar warned against comparisons with the drilling downturn of 2008. He cited the emergence of new U.S. oil resources, easy access to capital, the higher number of large customers in U.S. land drilling, improved contracts and equipment shortages. “All of these factors provide me with continued confidence in the resiliency of the North American market,” he said. Delays in operations in Iraq and an operational shutdown in Libya hurt third-quarter results, though Halliburton said profit from operations outside the United States “recovered at the rate we expected” during the quarter. Three rigs did start operating in Iraq toward the end of the quarter. In Libya, where rebels have ousted ruler Muammar Gaddafi, the company is assessing whether to reopen. Halliburton has put behind it a major liability attached to former unit KBR Inc (KBR.N), which just settled a five-year dispute over failed bolts on subsea oilfield flow lines off Brazil for $200 million.

73,HAL,Halliburton probes Angola unit after email tip-off,"* Halliburton has briefed DOJ/SEC on investigation * Halliburton, rivals all well versed in FCPA matters By Braden Reddall Oct 21 (Reuters) - U.S. oilfield services company Halliburton Co conducted an internal investigation of its Angolan operations after an anonymous email alleged its employees breached corruption laws. The disclosure on Friday comes only months after Halliburton closed the book on the final bribery probe related to $6 billion worth of contracts awarded for a Nigerian project to former subsidiary KBR Inc . The Angola-related email arrived in December 2010, and said certain current and former Halliburton personnel violated the U.S. Foreign Corruption Practices Act (FCPA), principally through the use of an Angolan vendor, Halliburton said. “The email also alleges conflicts of interest, self-dealing and the failure to act on alleged violations of our COBC (Code of Business Conduct) and the FCPA,” the Houston-based company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. After advising the U.S. Department of Justice of the probe, which includes assistance from outside lawyers and independent forensic accountants, Halliburton met last quarter with the DOJ and SEC to brief them and provide them documents, it said. The company described the investigations as “at an early stage” and could not predict their outcome or consequences. FCPA investigations are not uncommon in the industry. Weatherford International Ltd  has faced four years of scrutiny over its part in Iraq’s oil-for-food program, along with its past operations in certain sanctioned countries, including Sudan and Iran. The DOJ and SEC are probing Weatherford’s FCPA compliance and the embezzlement of $175,000 in payments to government officials in Europe, according to company filings. In 2007, Baker Hughes Inc settled investigations — disclosed four years prior — into its operations in Angola, Kazakhstan and Nigeria, for a total of $44 million.

75,HAL,BP says Halliburton destroyed Gulf spill evidence,"(Reuters) - BP Plc accused Halliburton Co of destroying evidence that the oilfield services company did inadequate cement work on the Gulf of Mexico oil well that blew out last year, and asked a federal judge to punish Halliburton. The accusation, in a BP court filing, raises the stakes ahead of a trial, expected in late February, to assign blame and damages for the April 2010 blowout of the Macondo well, which triggered the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history. Citing recent depositions and Halliburton’s own documents, BP said Halliburton “intentionally” destroyed the results of slurry testing for the well, in part to “eliminate any risk that this evidence would be used against it at trial.” The oil company also said Halliburton appeared to have lost computer evidence showing how the cement performed, with Halliburton maintaining that the information is simply “gone.” BP asked U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans, who oversees spill litigation, to sanction Halliburton by ruling that Halliburton’s slurry design was “unstable,” a finding of fact that could be used at trial. It also asked Barbier to direct that forensic experts be hired to find the missing computer data. “These remedies are amply warranted in law and by principles of fair play, and they are essential to ensure this court’s trial is not tainted by Halliburton’s misconduct,” BP said in the filing. Halliburton is the world’s second-largest oilfield services provider. A spokeswoman, Beverly Blohm Stafford, said the Houston-based company is reviewing BP’s filing. “We believe that the conclusion that BP is asking the court to draw is without merit and we look forward to contesting their motion in court,” she said. The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig’s explosion on April 20, 2010, caused 11 deaths, and brought tens of billions of dollars of lawsuits. Halliburton has accused BP of fraud and defamation, among other claims. BP has also sued Transocean Ltd, which owned the rig, and Cameron International Corp, which made a blowout preventer. In October, Anadarko Petroleum Corp, which owned 25 percent of the well, agreed to pay BP $4 billion toward clean-up costs and victims compensation. BP has also reached settlements with Mitsui & Co, whose MOEX Offshore 2007 LLC venture was a drilling partner, and Weatherford International Ltd, which provided equipment used in the well.

It also asked Barbier to direct that forensic experts be hired to find the missing computer data. “These remedies are amply warranted in law and by principles of fair play, and they are essential to ensure this court’s trial is not tainted by Halliburton’s misconduct,” BP said in the filing. Halliburton is the world’s second-largest oilfield services provider.

Citing recent depositions and Halliburton’s own documents, British oil company BP said on Monday that Halliburton “intentionally” destroyed the results of slurry testing for the well, in part to “eliminate any risk that this evidence would be used against it at trial.” Halliburton said BP has been aware of post-blowout tests for some time, but has chosen this late date in the litigation to mischaracterize the results of such tests. Contrary to BP’s assertions, Halliburton said the post-incident testing referred to in its motion was not conducted on rig samples. Rather, the informal testing BP refers to in its motion used off-the-shelf materials that yielded results that Halliburton believes have little or no relevance to the case.

81,HAL,BP challenges Halliburton court request on spill,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) has opened 2012 with a new legal move in its battle to force contractor Halliburton (HAL.C) to help pay the costs and expenses it incurred to clean up the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, which the oil major previously put at around $42 billion. Halliburton (HAL.C), the company that cemented the doomed well, had asked a court to force BP to recognize a contractual agreement that protected Halliburton against possible spill clean-up costs. In response, BP asked a court in a filing on Monday not to give a summary judgment on that request — one that would hand down a ruling without a full trial being held and could let Halliburton off the hook for a share of the total spill costs. BP restated a claim against Halliburton, first made in an April 2011 filing, that Halliburton should pay it damages “equal to, or in the alternative proportional to Halliburton’s fault,” to cover clean up costs and government fines BP might faces. Halliburton officials were not immediately available for comment. BP declined comment. BP shares traded up 2.2 percent at 1520 GMT, ahead of a 1.5 percent rise in the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index .SXEP. Its filing comes ahead of hearings on a collection of lawsuits, which are set to begin in New Orleans on February 27. The ‘multi-district litigation’ is expected to decide who will compensate those hurt by the spill, the extent of government fines and who will be remembered as the negligent party. BP has said it is ready to settle with its contractors, the parties who have suffered property and other damage, and the government, but not at any cost. Company sources told Reuters the company expects that if it does manage to cut a settlement of the cases, it will represent one of the largest legal settlements in U.S. corporate history. The explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in April 2010, which killed 11 workers and spewed more than 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf, has sparked a slew of lawsuits and federal citations against the companies involved. BP had been paying the costs of the response effort alone but Europe’s second-largest oil group by market value has now cut deals with its two partners in the doomed Macondo well, Anadarko and Mitsui. The two companies at first refuted their responsibility to contribute to oil spill bill, citing BP’s negligence.

83,HAL,Halliburton wins ruling vs BP over Gulf oil spill,"(Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday said Halliburton Co is not liable for some pollution claims arising from the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, setting back BP Plc’s effort to hold other companies responsible for part of the $42 billion cleanup. U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans said BP must indemnify Halliburton, which provided cementing services for the Macondo oil well, for third-party compensatory claims under their contract, even if Halliburton is found grossly negligent. The indemnification relates to claims arising from pollution or contamination that did not originate from Halliburton property located above the land or water. Halliburton would still be responsible for punitive damages, as well as civil fines under the federal Clean Water Act. “This is a very positive step for Halliburton, however outstanding issues still remain,” wrote Angie Sedita, a UBS Securities LLC analyst who has a “buy” rating on that company. “The claim of fraud against Halliburton and thus a breach of contract does appear to leave an open issue in the court’s eyes.” Barbier issued a similar ruling on January 26 that required BP to indemnify Transocean Ltd, which owned the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, on compensatory damages claims. That ruling meant BP could not shift more than $15 billion of costs for the spill. BP spokesman Daren Beaudo said the Halliburton decision sends a “strong signal” that contractors involved in critical well operations will be held accountable. He said it means BP’s indemnity “could be void” if Halliburton committed fraud. Halliburton spokeswoman Beverly Stafford said that company agrees with Tuesday’s decision “to the extent that it requires BP to honor its contractual indemnity obligations.” Barbier oversees multidistrict litigation over the April 20, 2010, explosion of the Deepwater Horizon. The accident caused 11 deaths and the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history. Barbier has set a February 27 start date for a bench trial to apportion blame. Halliburton is based in Houston, and BP in London. Halliburton shares closed up 11 cents to $36.78, and BP’s American depositary receipts rose $1.77, or 4.01 percent, to $45.91.

86,HAL,BP can't keep settlements out of oil spill trial,"* BP request premature -judge * Ruling is a victory for Halliburton * Halliburton: Settlements could reflect bias in BP favor * BP has settled with Anadarko, MOEX, Cameron, Weatherford By Jonathan Stempel Feb 7 (Reuters) - A federal judge rejected BP Plc’s  effort to keep evidence about settlements out of the upcoming trial to decide who is responsible for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Tuesday’s ruling by U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans, scheduled to preside in a non-jury trial beginning Feb. 27, is a victory for Halliburton Co, which had provided cementing services for the Macondo oil well. The Houston-based company had argued that evidence of settlements or negotiations could show the settling companies’ potential bias in BP’s favor, which Halliburton could then use in its defense. BP countered that excluding such information was consistent with federal rules on evidence, and that such details are irrelevant to establishing liability. Barbier concluded that the London-based oil company’s request was premature, even though there were “plausible scenarios” in which settlement evidence could reflect bias. “The proper course is to wait until any settlement evidence is actually sought to be introduced to determine admissibility,” he wrote. BP has reached settlements with two partners in the Macondo well: $4 billion with Anadarko Petroleum Corp, and $1.065 billion with Mitsui & Co’s MOEX unit. It also reached settlements of $250 million with Cameron International Corp, which made a blowout preventer, and $75 million with Weatherford International Ltd , which made a float collar used in cementing and which controls the flow of drilling fluids. Halliburton has not settled with BP. Transocean Ltd , which owned the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that exploded on April 20, 2010, also has not settled. Earlier on Tuesday, BP reported a higher quarterly profit and raised its dividend for the first time since the spill.

The company had expected North America’s fracking market to stay in balance through the year, but Chief Financial Officer Mark McCollum said the effects of a mild winter on gas prices could deepen the slump and lead to some overcapacity by mid-2012. Speaking at the Credit Suisse Energy Summit on Tuesday, McCollum repeated warnings about the disruptions of moving fracking crews out of natural gas basins to liquids regions. He also said weather disruptions could temporarily knock about a percentage point off profit margins, which were above 27 percent in the fourth quarter. “That then would go away as the year progresses,” he said. He anticipated improvement in margins outside North America, which were 15 percent last quarter, throughout the year.

88,HAL,BP wins exclusion of emails from oil spill trial,"* Emails on testing, cement work excluded * BP, Halliburton win rulings excluding emails * Feb. 27 trial over largest offshore US oil spill By Jonathan Stempel Feb 8 (Reuters) - BP Plc won a court order keeping several potentially damaging emails out of a scheduled trial to determine responsibility for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Wednesday’s ruling by U.S. Magistrate Judge Sally Shushan in New Orleans came a day after U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier rejected the oil company’s effort to keep evidence about settlements it had already reached out of the trial. The rulings came as Barbier prepares to preside on Feb. 27 over a non-jury trial to assign blame for the April 20, 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig, which killed 11 people and caused the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history. Plaintiffs include individuals and businesses, represented by a plaintiffs’ steering committee that had sought to introduce the email evidence, as well as states and the U.S. government. The main corporate defendants include BP, rig owner Transocean Ltd and Halliburton Co, which provided cementing services for the Macondo oil well. Anadarko Petroleum Corp, one of BP’s partners in the well, is also involved in the trial. Shushan granted BP’s request to exclude as hearsay several 2009 emails among Anadarko employees about tropical storm damage to another Transocean rig that had been under contract to BP. In one email, an Anadarko employee expressed disappointment that BP had not disclosed some information related to the damage, prompting another to respond: “Bummer. I’m amazed that they did not tell us about this.” Shushan also granted BP’s and Transocean’s request to keep out a June 2010 email from Halliburton employee Ryan Haire questioning their reported findings regarding some tests, saying he had no personal knowledge of those findings. The judge also granted Halliburton’s request to exclude an email from a BP geologist to a colleague in February 2010, offering “thanks for the shitty cement job.” Halliburton contended that the email was no more than a casual, tasteless joke made by one friend to another. Shushan concluded that there was no showing that the email was a “business record” of the cement work that could be introduced into evidence. Barbier had on Tuesday ruled in Halliburton’s favor on whether evidence of BP’s settlements with Anadarko and other companies was admissible at trial. Halliburton had said such evidence could show the settling companies’ potential bias in BP’s favor, while BP had countered that they were irrelevant to establishing liability. Bob Dudley, BP’s chief executive, said on Tuesday that he was prepared to settle the entire case on reasonable terms, but would otherwise go to trial. The London-based company also reported a higher quarterly profit and raised its dividend. BP has set aside roughly $42 billion for spill costs. Lucy Haskins, a Barclays Capital analyst, wrote on Wednesday that the cost could top $60 billion if BP were found grossly negligent.

Shale drilling has been largely a North American phenomenon so far, but new basins are being explored around the world. With 5,600 Asia-Pacific staff already, Halliburton wants to extend abroad its leadership in shale drilling in North America, where growth is slowing down. “Expanding into the Asia Pacific market and providing the same quality level of service we already provide in North America fits into that strategy,” said Jeff Miller, Halliburton`s senior vice president of global business development and marketing. China and India were early participants in the U.S. State Department’s Global Shale Gas Initiative, while Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia are expected to develop shale gas in the years ahead, according to an analysis by the Houston-based Baker Institute.",2102012,http://www.reuters.com/article/halliburton-brief/update-1-halliburton-teams-with-petronas-in-asia-shale-push-idUSL4E8DA64Y20120210

Halliburton disclosed in its annual report on Thursday that KBR, a U.S. engineering company, had filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The award to Barracuda & Caratinga Leasing Co, controlled by Brazilian oil giant Petrobras, related to failed bolts on subsea flowlines that were part of a $2.5 billion oilfield project contract awarded to KBR. After the settlement in September 2011, KBR said in a regulatory filing a month later that Halliburton may decide to challenge all or part of the award, in which case KBR would be responsible for the associated legal costs. Under their 2007 separation, Halliburton had agreed to shoulder any Barracuda-Caratinga award against KBR, formerly known as Kellogg Brown & Root. The Brazilians then filed a lawsuit in November to enforce the arbitration award. It is Barracuda & Caratinga Leasing Co v.

91,HAL,"Halliburton profit up, but North America pressured","(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the world’s second-largest oilfield services company, reported a higher quarterly profit as North American sales hit a record high despite major challenges, and its shares rose more than 4 percent. Chief Executive Officer David Lesar attributed the company’s strength in North America to new oil drilling activity in the United States. That helped offset a drop in natural gas drilling due to weak prices, which have fallen to their lowest point in a decade. Halliburton is the market leader in pressure pumping, used in hydraulic fracturing to extract oil and gas from shale. New technology has opened up new sources that are likely to keep prices low for years. Lesar said he expected the downward push on the pricing for hydraulic fracturing to ease up later this year, but said the huge shift of resources out of natural gas basins would weigh on the North American market leader in the near term. “While these moves are beneficial to us in the long run, they do not come without a short-term impact on our margins,” Lesar said on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. Halliburton is moving five more fracking fleets in addition to the eight moved last quarter, he said. Like many smaller rivals, the company is deferring some new deliveries of pressure pumping equipment, which is used in fracking, until next year. “We believe the (North American) pressure pumping capacity concerns will continue to overhang the stock over the coming several quarters,” UBS analyst Angie Sedita said in a note to investors. “However, it is already reflected in the stock, given the company’s 45 percent discount to historical valuations.” Halliburton shares were up 4.5 percent at $34.13 in midday trading on Wednesday, while global market leader Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) was up 0.7 percent. Halliburton said its first-quarter profit rose to $627 million, or 68 cents per share, from $511 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items that included a $300 million charge for estimated losses from the BP Plc (BP.L) Gulf of Mexico oil spill two years ago, earnings per share of 89 cents topped the analysts’ average estimate of 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 30 percent to $6.9 billion, including a record $4.2 billion in North America. Halliburton earned more than three-quarters of its 2011 income in North America, compared with two-fifths for Schlumberger. Halliburton said its North American margins would fall into the low 20 percent range by the end of 2012, down from about 25 percent currently, in what Chief Financial Officer Mark McCollum described as a “dynamic” market. “These margin expectations depend on, among other things, our success in recovering inflationary cost increases from our customers, and how soon the natural gas rig count levels off,” McCollum said. “We should have a better feel for this after the second quarter.” The company has suffered as guar, a key ingredient for fracking fluid derived from a crop mostly grown in India, rose in price by 10 times in the past year. McCollum said the guar gel system can now represent more than 30 percent of the total frack price to Halliburton customers in certain basins. McCollum said he expected North American margins to drop by between 2 and 2.5 percentage points in the second quarter. But Simmons & Co analysts said industry leaders would be much better able than smaller companies to withstand this kind of pressure. Shares of Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N, which issued a warning about troubles in the North American market last month, were unchanged on Wednesday.

98,HAL,Halliburton second quarter hit by costly Indian bean shortage,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N) said a shortage of guar beans in India meant North American profit margins this quarter would drop by twice as much as it had expected, knocking its shares down by 5 percent to an 8-month low. Guar, which is also used to make sauces and ice cream, is a key part of the hydraulic fracturing fluids that have been in high demand due to a boom in U.S. drilling and well development. Halliburton, the world’s second-largest oilfield services company, has said the guar system can now account for as much as 30 percent of the overall fracking price. “They’ve been passing along the cost incrementally, but because there’s been such a burst in pricing, it’s been hard to keep up with,” said Grant Fox, an analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach. Farmers in dominant guar producer India are scrambling to meet the demand for their crop from the other side of the world and prices are expected to ease by 2013. “The price of guar gum has inflated more rapidly than previously expected, due to concerns over the potential for shortages for the commodity later in 2012,” Halliburton said in a statement on Wednesday. The high cost of guar gum, which was noted by sweeteners and starches group Tate & Lyle Plc (TATE.L) when it reported results last week, has been felt across the oilfield services sector. Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N has talked of its “horrific” price, while Nabors Industries Ltd (NBR.N) is seeking alternatives. Analysts had previously speculated that Halliburton’s leadership in fracking might mean its supply chain was stronger and that it could absorb such cost rises better than others. But because of guar, Halliburton now expects second-quarter North American operating margins to decrease between 5 and 5.5 percentage points from the first-quarter level of 25 percent - a drop of 3 percentage points more than it expected in April. That would put the margins down below the low 20 percent range the company expected them to hit later this year. Halliburton plans to try to offset the higher guar costs in the second half of 2012 by seeking relief from customers and using more “synthetic and other guar alternatives.” “We believe higher costs will be difficult to recover from the customer,” UBS analyst Angie Sedita said in a note to clients on Wednesday, as she cut her estimates for second-quarter earnings by 12 percent. Halliburton shares, which had risen nearly 2 percent before the news, closed 3.5 percent down at $28.10 after touching their lowest since last October. Baker Hughes also erased early gains and ended down 1 percent at $40.65 after the warning from its larger rival.

The cause of the cost escalation is pricier guar gum, an agricultural commodity used in hydraulic fracturing fluids and in high demand because of the surge in U.S. well development. Halliburton has said the guar system can now account for as much as 30 percent of the overall fracking price. “They’ve been passing along the cost incrementally, but because there’s been such a burst in pricing, it’s been hard to keep up with,” said Grant Fox, analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach.

That puts the margins down below the low 20 percent range that the company had expected them to hit later this year. Sterne Agee’s Fox also expected the pricing impact of guar would likely begin easing later this year, or in early 2013. Shares of Halliburton, which had risen nearly 2 percent before the news, fell 4 percent to $27.95, their lowest level since last October. Shares of Baker Hughes Inc also erased early gains and were down 2.5 percent at $40.07 after the warning from its larger rival.

102,HAL,"After first-half surge, US drillers find respite in guar wars","* New guar supplies brought to U.S. market * Guar prices now at $7 a pound, half the levels seen in May * Halliburton has four months of supply in stock * Indian imports at risk as farmers slow guar sowing By Selam Gebrekidan NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas drillers are finally catching a break from the surging cost of a tiny seed at the heart of the nation’s oil and gas bonanza. After a surprise three-fold price surge in the first five months of 2012, which roiled earnings for oil services firms and threatened to stall the domestic boom, the price of guar gum — used to thicken the slurry of water, sand and chemicals that is pumped into wells during hydraulic fracturing — has halved over the past few weeks. Prices have tumbled almost as quickly as they surged as a fierce bidding war for short-term supplies eased, only after top buyer Halliburton amassed a four-month “strategic reserve”. Suppliers that had been sitting on last year’s harvest also unleashed those stocks on the market. Guar prices spiked to a record $14 a pound in the second quarter but have since dropped to as low as $6 a pound, according to FTS International, one of the top five fracking service providers in North America. “It looks like there’s plenty of guar out there and the market is starting to balance itself,” said David Pursell with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. For the bigger oil-service firms, who use millions of pounds a month, this price drop may cut costs by close to $100 million a month. Halliburton, the leading fracking services provider, for example, uses 12 million to 14 million pounds of guar a month, according to Barclays estimates. However, it is likely too soon for most companies to benefit from the decline. Even Halliburton warned last month that its second quarter-earnings, to be released on Monday, will be hit by the earlier price spike. And concerns remain that supplies will run short early next year. Most of the supply comes from India and farmers there have not covered as many fields with guar seeds as they did last year although they started planting early and had hoped to increase guar acreage by a third. This ebb and flow of supplies, and the attendant volatility it has brought to the cost of producing shale oil and gas may affect hopes for energy independence in the world’s top crude consumer. Gaur’s explosive rise this year was the most dramatic among the many specialized components in the “fracking” process”, which companies use to tap oil and gas from unconventional shale plays. Sand and ceramics prices, also key inputs, have risen too but at a smaller clip. Companies that provide fracking services to oil producers felt the pain most keenly. In April, Halliburton CEO David Lesar called attention to the price volatility that resulted from tight supplies saying it is “the fastest-moving commodity price that I have ever seen.” However, Halliburton itself likely contributed to the rally by embarking on an aggressive and successful campaign to build up a private stockpile that would protect it from future supply gaps. “We have about four months of inventory of guar in our warehouses,” company CFO Mark McCollum said in June. “We’re not using that...it is sitting there, but we had built that up and of course we’re buying the current guar in the spot market.” In the week following Halliburton’s statement, prices fell for the first time this year, quickly halving their value within six weeks, according to data from Agra Informa. Baker Hughes, the third-largest fracking services provider in the market, also has enough stocks to last it until August and is securing supply for the rest of 2012, Barclays said. Baker Hughes, which will report its second-quarter earnings Friday, declined to comment for this story. “Not long after (Halliburton) completed its strategic reserve buildup, a large quantity of guar entered the market, reducing the potential for a short squeeze in guar this fall,” Barclays analyst James West said in a note. Still, the U.S. energy industry remains heavily dependent on Indian imports since guar substitutes — such as cellulose gum derived from cotton fiber — have not proven as successful. Some 98 percent of U.S. guar imports come from India. “Nobody has come up with something synthetic that works as well,” says Calvin Trostle, an expert on the legume with the Texas AgriLife Research & Extension Center in Lubbock, Texas. Imports from India jumped 60 percent in the first five months of the year versus 2011, according to customs data. May imports were up 16.4 percent from a year earlier, the data showed. Any hiccups in India’s crop could make guar costly, quickly. After an early start to their planting season in May, Indian farmers have slowed sowing guar, disappointed by scant monsoon rains, according to official state reports. In mid July only 741,000 hectares (1.83 million acres) of land was seeded with guar in India’s northern Rajasthan state — home to 80 percent of the nation’s harvest, compared with 1.3 million hectares a year earlier. Farmers have until mid-August to catch up and they plan to sow a third more land with guar this year than they did in 2011. The Indian commodity markets regulator, which banned guar futures trading in March, plans to re-list the contracts once it ascertains the volume of crops planted in the country this year. The final output, however, will not be clearly known until harvests start in October and November. Halliburton and the other oil-service firms have a more optimistic outlook. “There’s been triple the amount of guar planted this year versus last year,” McCollum said in June. “And so when the crop comes...the price of guar will drop dramatically.”",7202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/shale-fracking-guar/after-first-half-surge-us-drillers-find-respite-in-guar-wars-idUSL2E8IJHO220120720
103,HAL,Halliburton Q2 tops Wall Street; sees better North America in '13,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N) posted a quarterly profit on Monday that topped Wall Street forecasts, helped by increased activity outside North America, where it expected margins would start recovering by early next year. Shares of Halliburton, the world’s second-largest oilfield services company behind Schlumberger (SLB.N), rose 2.5 percent despite a decline in oil prices weighing down the sector .OSX. Halliburton had warned last month that a shortage of guar beans in India would depress margins at its pressure pumping operations in shale fields, a key profit driver for the company. Guar, which is also used to make sauces and ice cream, is a key part of the hydraulic fracturing fluids that have been in high demand due to a boom in U.S. drilling and well development. Chief Executive David Lesar said on a conference call that the company’s decision to stockpile guar over the quarter meant it would be absorbing the higher guar costs for the rest of the year, even though prices were now declining. He referred to the elevated guar costs as like moving a “pig through the python.” “With 20/20 hindsight, simply put, we made the wrong decision. The result is we bought too much guar too early and paid too much for it,” Lesar said. “I want to be clear with you — I supported and agreed with the decision to secure the strategic guar reserve, and I will take the heat for it.” Halliburton has said previously that the guar system can account for as much as 30 percent of the overall fracking price. The shortage hurt earnings at its industry-leading fracking business and pulled profits slightly below the year-ago level. That compared with the results from Schlumberger and Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N, which both posted higher profits on Friday, also lifted by strength outside North America. Still, Halliburton’s North American results were not as weak as many company watchers had feared. “North American margin degradation was less than expected,” Barclays analyst James West said in a note to investors. At its current share price “we believe Halliburton represents compelling value.” Halliburton has benefited from its leading position in North America in recent years as oil and gas producers poured money into developing shale fields, although its rising costs and a steep drop in natural gas prices have crimped profits this year. Net profit slipped to $737 million, or 79 cents per share, from $739 million, or 80 cents per share, a year before. Profit from continuing operations was 80 cents per share, beating the 75 cents that analysts on average had forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 22 percent to $7.2 billion, well above the $6.96 billion analysts had predicted. A drop of the nearly 5 percentage points in North American margins was partially offset by increased profitability in other markets, particularly Europe, Africa and Russia and other former Soviet states. Guar accounted for about two-thirds of the margin depression in North America, Halliburton said. Halliburton earned more than three-quarters of its 2011 income in North America, compared with about 40 percent for Schlumberger.

104,HAL,UPDATE 3-Halliburton Q2 tops Wall St; sees better NAmerica in '13,"By Matt Daily and Braden Reddall July 23 (Reuters) - Halliburton Co posted a quarterly profit on Monday that topped Wall Street forecasts, helped by increased activity outside North America, where it expected margins would start recovering by early next year. Shares of Halliburton, the world’s second-largest oilfield services company behind Schlumberger, rose 2.5 percent despite a decline in oil prices weighing down the sector. Halliburton had warned last month that a shortage of guar beans in India would depress margins at its pressure pumping operations in shale fields, a key profit driver for the company. Guar, which is also used to make sauces and ice cream, is a key part of the hydraulic fracturing fluids that have been in high demand due to a boom in U.S. drilling and well development. Chief Executive David Lesar said on a conference call that the company’s decision to stockpile guar over the quarter meant it would be absorbing the higher guar costs for the rest of the year, even though prices were now declining. He referred to the elevated guar costs as like moving a “pig through the python.” “With 20/20 hindsight, simply put, we made the wrong decision. The result is we bought too much guar too early and paid too much for it,” Lesar said. “I want to be clear with you — I supported and agreed with the decision to secure the strategic guar reserve, and I will take the heat for it.” Halliburton has said previously that the guar system can account for as much as 30 percent of the overall fracking price.

106,HAL,Halliburton takes KBR to court over $256 mln tax dispute,"July 27 (Reuters) - Halliburton Co and KBR Inc  are battling in court over a $256 million tax dispute, as the two companies seek to put to bed the various issues lingering from their corporate break-up five years ago. Especially in relation to work done for the U.S. military in Iraq, Halliburton, the world’s second-largest oilfield services company, and its engineering spin-off have found themselves in court a number of times since their split, usually on the same side. Separately, Halliburton said in a regulatory filing on Friday that it was investigating payments to third-party agents relating to customs and visa matters in Iraq, as well as payments made to an agent related to customs in Angola. It gave no more details, except to say this was disclosed to U.S. authorities last quarter during a meeting about a separate investigation of Halliburton’s Angola unit over possible Foreign Corrupt Practice Act violations. As for the Halliburton/KBR tax-sharing agreement, it covers taxes for 2001 through their 2007 separation, which can only be finalized once the tax authorities and both companies have analyzed the results, Halliburton said. Halliburton said it requested last quarter the appointment of an arbitrator, in accordance with the agreement, to find that KBR owed it $256 million. But KBR denied it owes anything, arguing that Halliburton actually owes it money under the agreement, and that the dispute should be settled under the master separation agreement instead. So on July 10, Halliburton filed suit in the District Court of Harris County, Texas, to compel KBR to arbitrate it under the tax sharing agreement. KBR said in its quarterly filing with regulators this week that it was evaluating its response. It is not the first time they have tussled over the terms of their split. In 2010, Halliburton threatened to scrap its indemnification of KBR for corruption charge penalties if KBR decided to take control of a certain investigation. That probe was related to some bribes on $6 billion worth of contracts awarded to KBR for Nigeria’s Bonny Island liquefied natural gas project, a matter on which Halliburton finally closed the book last year.",7272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/halliburton-kbr-taxes/halliburton-takes-kbr-to-court-over-256-mln-tax-dispute-idUSL2E8IRATM20120727
107,HAL,Halliburton sees drop in North American revenue in third quarter,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the largest oilfield services provider in the United States, said a decline in North American drilling would lower revenue in the region in the third quarter from the second quarter. U.S. benchmark natural gas prices, despite pulling away from decade lows, are still down more than 25 percent from last year. So the number of rigs working has steadily dropped across North America, dampening services companies’ pricing power. Halliburton, which had been looking for steady revenue, said the effect of weaker pricing on North American profit margins in the third quarter would be between 2.5 and 3 percentage points. “We do expect that the margin degradation relative to price will level out as we conclude the year,” Chief Financial Officer Mark McCollum said at the Barclays CEO Energy/Power Conference in New York, which was available via webcast. Shares of Halliburton underperformed the sector on Tuesday as a result of the new profit outlook, trading down 2.2 percent at $32.05, compared with a 0.8 percent decline in the Philadelphia Oil Service index .OSX. Halliburton’s North American operating margins fell 5 percentage points in the second quarter from the first, to below 22 percent, with about a third of that drop caused by lower prices. The other two-thirds of the margin depression was due to the jump in prices for a key hydraulic fracturing ingredient, guar. McCollum reiterated that high guar prices would weigh on North American margins throughout the rest of this year. “I suspect that there won’t be significant relief from guar pricing in the fourth quarter,” he said, while noting the recent good news of rain in India, the world’s dominant supplier of guar beans. “All indications suggest that we should see a significant moderation in guar pricing as we go into 2013,” he added. McCollum said a positive aspect was that Halliburton’s substitute for guar, PermStim, met 5 percent of its guar demand in the second quarter, and the uptake had been even more dramatic in the current quarter.

112,HAL,"Halliburton profit falls on subdued U.S., fourth quarter looks tough","(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N) said its third-quarter profit fell due to inflated raw material costs and a slowdown in U.S. drilling, which showed no signs of picking up as many clients’ budgets for the year were already spent. Halliburton, the world’s No. 2 oilfield services company, said North American margins ended up even lower than it warned of last month - at just over 15 percent. It added that weaker activity and pricing pressure will likely erode them again in the fourth quarter. The margins stood at nearly 27 percent in the first quarter of this year. Shares of Halliburton fell 1.5 percent to $34.05 as its underlying quarterly profit came in lower than expected on Wednesday. Shares of rivals Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N were slightly higher on the New York Stock Exchange. They both report results on Friday. Oilfield services companies have had far less pricing power as depressed natural gas prices reduced the number of U.S. rigs targeting gas to a 13-year low. While the U.S. oil-directed rig count rose 3 percent from the second quarter, that did not offset a 18 percent drop in gas rigs, Halliburton said. North American revenue fell 5 percent from the second quarter, hit by weak hydraulic fracturing demand and partly due to disruptions caused by Hurricane Isaac. “We are also seeing activity reductions by some of our customers as they continue to moderate activity to operate within their stated 2012 budgets,” Chief Executive David Lesar said, before predicting a “pretty bumpy” few quarters ahead. International revenue rose 2 percent from the second quarter despite a 2 percent decline in the global rig count, lifted by solid growth in Latin America and the Middle East. Lesar remained confident in the long-term fundamentals of the overall business, saying the strategy was unchanged, with a focus on strengthening international margins and growing market share in deepwater, global unconventional drilling and underserved international markets. “Somewhat puzzling that the strategy is unchanged, given that the growth profile for the industry is considerably less robust than was the case coming into this year,” Simmons & Co analyst Bill Herbert said in a note to clients. Net income fell to $604 million, or 65 cents per share, in the third quarter from $685 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9 percent to $7.1 billion. Income from continuing operations, on an adjusted basis, was 67 cents per share, in line with expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But analysts said about 4 cents per share were due to lower taxes and corporate expenses. Halliburton’s second-quarter decision to stockpile guar, a key ingredient in fracking fluid, has backfired, now that prices are falling. That shaved about 6 percentage points off North American margins, but the pressure on profits will fade away early next year, executives said. The company also plans to start idling pressure pumping capacity until the current glut in North America is cleared. That will eliminate the need to keep fracking crews busy with lower-priced work. Capital expenditures for 2013 are expected to be lower than the anticipated $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion this year, Chief Financial Officer Mark McCollum said, as the company spends less on building new pumping equipment.

120,HAL,UPDATE 6-Transocean to pay $1.4 billion for role in BP oil spill,"* Transocean owned rig in 2010 Macondo disaster * Payment less than company set aside, shares jump 6.4 pct * Settlement still to be reached with plaintiffs * Halliburton still to settle with DoJ; its shares up 1.7 pct By David Ingram WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Transocean Ltd agreed to pay $1.4 billion to settle U.S. government charges over BP Plc’s massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 and the rig contractor admitted that its crew on the Deepwater Horizon was partly responsible. Transocean, which employed nine of the 11 workers killed in the accident, had set aside $1.5 billion for the U.S. Department of Justice out of a $1.95 billion Macondo loss provision. The settlement, unveiled on Thursday by the DoJ, includes $1 billion in civil penalties and $400 million in criminal penalties. Still looming is a settlement with the plaintiffs committee that represents more than 100,000 individuals and business owners claiming economic and medical damages. So the ultimate cost of Macondo to Transocean could end up being more than $4 billion, UBS analyst Angie Sedita said. Last year, BP reached a $7.8 billion plaintiffs liability settlement. The shares of Switzerland-based Transocean rose 6.4 percent to close at $49.21 in New York on the lower-than-expected DoJ payout, with Barclays having expected a settlement of $2.5 billion. The cost of insuring Transocean debt fell sharply. “The bottom line to me is they now can put away the big black cloud that has been hanging over them,” said Phil Weiss, an oil analyst at Argus Research. BP and its contractors have sought to push blame on to each other since the 2010 well explosion caused the largest-ever U.S. offshore oil spill. Lawyers and analysts see the federal settlements with BP, and now Transocean, as a solid legal framework to start putting the disaster behind them. Halliburton Co, which performed cementing work on the Macondo well, remains the only one not to have settled. Daniel Becnel, a Louisiana lawyer representing spill-related claimants, believes that settlement is merely a matter of time because none of the three really wants to fight it out in court. The BP-contracted Deepwater Horizon was drilling the mile-deep well on April 20, 2010, when a surge of methane gas caused a blowout. The accident led to a months-long U.S. deepwater ban and intense scrutiny of the offshore drilling industry, which is now booming worldwide despite lingering public concerns. Of the $400 million in Transocean criminal fines, $150 million will help protect the Gulf of Mexico, while another $150 million will fund spill prevention and response efforts there, the DoJ said. Transocean must also implement court-enforceable measures to improve safety and emergency response on U.S. rigs. “From what I have read, they (Transocean) played a part, but BP is the lion’s share and ought to pay $15 billion dollars.” said Tony Kennon, mayor of Orange Beach, Alabama. The U.S. Chemical Safety Board found that BP and Transocean both had “safety management system deficiencies that contributed to the Macondo incident,” and neither had adequate safety rules. The DoJ said that in agreeing to plead guilty to violating the Clean Water Act, Transocean admitted that members of its crew, acting at BP’s direction, were negligent in failing fully to investigate indications that the Macondo well was not secure. “Unfortunately, Halliburton continues to deny its significant role in the accident, including its failure to adequately cement and monitor the well,” BP said in a statement. Halliburton said it had substantial legal arguments against any liability, including an indemnity in its contract with BP. Halliburton shares closed 1.7 percent higher at $36.31. BP agreed in November to a DoJ settlement of its own worth $4.5 billion, including the largest criminal fine ever at $1.256 billion. The London-based oil company also agreed to plead guilty to obstruction of Congress, a felony. New York-traded shares of BP closed 2 percent higher on Thursday. Attention now turns to any possible settlements ahead of a Macondo-related trial due to start on Feb. 25 in New Orleans, including for Clean Water Act (CWA) violations that may cost BP $21 billion if it is found grossly negligent. “That’s where fairness will be found - or lost,” National Audubon Society CEO David Yarnold said of BP’s CWA case, since most of the fines would go toward restoring the Gulf of Mexico.",1032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-transocean-settlement/update-6-transocean-to-pay-1-4-billion-for-role-in-bp-oil-spill-idUSL1E9C34Q720130103
121,HAL,Global drilling lifts Halliburton out of domestic mire,"(Reuters) - Haliburton Co’s (HAL.N) overseas business lifted fourth-quarter earnings above expectations, belying how tough the market is for North American oilfield services due to the glut of natural gas. Shares of Halliburton, the world’s second-largest oilfield services company and the North American leader, rose nearly 5 percent on Friday to their highest levels for more than a year. Strong margins in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Africa helped make up for a 58 percent drop in operating income in North America, where the “unconventional” boom, driven by hydraulic fracturing, has produced all the natural gas that put the market for services so badly out of joint. In a reversal of past quarters, 53 percent of Houston-based Halliburton’s profits came from outside its home market, helped in part by the growth of “fracking” abroad. “Globally, 2012 was a watershed year for the expansion of unconventionals,” Chief Executive David Lesar said, noting its work on the first unconventional wells in China and Australia and moves toward them in Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Argentina. In the fourth quarter of 2011, Halliburton made only 22 percent of its operating earnings in international markets. Industry leader Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), which has long set itself apart by earning more money outside North America, posted better-than-expected results last week. Profits for competitor Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N, on the other hand, were hit hard by the U.S. slump. Oilfield companies’ pricing power, especially for the pressure pumping fleets used in fracking, has evaporated as the number of U.S. rigs targeting gas hit 13-year lows. North American land drilling is likely to remain subdued this year as oil and gas companies forecast spending around 2012 levels. “We believe that without a significant uptick in natural gas drilling, it is difficult to see a path for pressure pumping equipment to reach equilibrium this year,” Lesar said. Halliburton expects the North America rig count to improve from fourth-quarter levels in 2013, though it will be down slightly compared to 2012. The company, however, does view the fourth quarter as a low water mark for profit margins, which at 12 percent were half of what they were at the start of 2012 and what the company considers to be “normalized” levels. After last year’s stockpiling of guar — a key ingredient for fracking fluid — at record-high prices, Halliburton now believes its guar inventory will be at market prices by the second quarter, which will drive down costs. Halliburton expects 2013 margins in the Eastern Hemisphere to average in the “upper teens,” which is better than some analysts’ expectations. Fourth-quarter net income fell 35 percent to $589 million, or 63 cents per share, which beat the consensus expectation of 60 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 3 percent to $7.3 billion, above the average estimate of $7.06 billion. Simmons & Co analysts called the performance “commendable” relative to negative expectations, with both Schlumberger and Baker Hughes issuing profit warnings last month. Shares of Halliburton were up 4.9 percent at $39.64 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

123,HAL,COLUMN-Frac of the future: John Kemp,"By John Kemp LONDON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Oilfield services company Halliburton blamed the upfront cost of rolling out its “frac of the future” efficiency initiative, as well as lower rig rates and idled equipment, for shrinking margins in its North American business, when the company presented its Q4 results on Friday. Frac (or frack as it also called) of the future maybe causing the company some discomfort in the short term. But it is a perfect case study of how the drilling industry is innovating in response to pressure to cut costs and its environmental footprint. HIGH-HORSEPOWER GAS ENGINES Working with Apache, a major gas producer, and Caterpillar, an equipment supplier, Halliburton has started to convert some of its pressure pumping units employed in fracturing operations to a dual-fuel system that uses compressed or liquefied natural gas as well as diesel as a source of power. Natural gas is cleaner burning than diesel, allowing Halliburton to claim its dual-fuel system cuts carbon emissions and is more environmentally friendly. Much more importantly, natural gas is plentiful and cheap, especially in the oil and gas producing regions, while oil is more than six times as expensive on a calorific basis, and diesel is the most expensive refined fuel of them all. Converting pressure pumps to run on a gas-diesel mix is mutually beneficial for gas producers, who do not know what to do with all the gas currently coming out of the ground, and drilling companies, under pressure to show they can drill and complete wells more cheaply to cope with depressed U.S. gas and increasingly oil prices. Caterpillar’s Dynamic Gas Blending (DGB) sets allow customers to use up to 70 percent natural gas in their existing diesel engines with no loss of performance, and can be retrofitted to existing equipment, according to the company. The new DGB kits were specifically designed for petroleum operations, and were first released to customers in 2012. They have already been supplied to Halliburton and a range of other drilling and pumping companies. Oilfield operations account for only a tiny fraction of total diesel demand. But Dynamic Gas Blending engines could in principle be used in a much wider range of industrial operations, providing another way for cheap gas to displace expensive oil in one of the liquid fuel’s remaining core markets . “Caterpillar believes the price disconnect between petroleum and natural gas is here for the foreseeable future. (The company) sees natural gas as the future for high-horsepower applications — the higher the horsepower, the faster the adoption — and is betting that its commitment will pull the market along,” the specialist website “Fleets and Fuels” reported in September. “Large engines are going gas,” a Caterpillar official associated with the programme told a Houston conference. “It becomes economically suicidal not to do anything else (“Caterpillar embraces natural gas” Sep 27). Allowing for self-interested ebullience, there is clear interest in replacing expensive diesel with cheaper gas in a wide range of applications. Frac of the future is also introducing vertical storage silos for storing the frac sand (proppant) employed in fracking operations. Rather grandly named the “SandCastle PS-2500 Vertical Storage System,” which at least shows someone at the company has a sense of humour, it minimises the amount of ground space by the simple expedient of storing the frac sand in a vertical tower, with solar power providing all the operating power needs for the unit (). It is a prosaic innovation. But fracking firms are under intense pressure to drill and frack more wells from fewer and smaller pads. SandCastle is just one example of numerous large and small operational improvements drilling and fracking firms are introducing in the field to squeeze costs out of the process. They come in response to pressure from clients worried about the continued economics of exploration in a world where gas prices are already low and oil and liquids prices are coming under pressure and likely to fall in future. Necessity (in this case low natural gas prices) is again proving the mother of invention.",1252013,http://www.reuters.com/article/column-kemp-smarter-fracking/column-frac-of-the-future-john-kemp-idUSL6N0AU9EK20130125

According to a Halliburton filing on Monday, the payment was made in January to Barracuda & Caratinga Leasing Co (BCLC) to settle the dispute over failed bolts on subsea flowlines that were part of a $2.5 billion oilfield contract awarded to KBR. BCLC, controlled by giant Brazilian oil company Petrobras , first filed for arbitration of the issue in March 2006. The arbitrators found in BCLC’s favor in late 2011, and KBR challenged the decision in a New York court. Under the 2007 separation agreement between KBR and Halliburton, the oilfield services giant agreed to shoulder any Barracuda-Caratinga award against KBR. Halliburton disclosed in its annual report on Monday that it recorded an $80 million tax benefit in 2012 related to the satisfaction of this obligation.

129,HAL,"Halliburton in Gulf spill settlement talks, stock jumps","(Reuters) - Halliburton Co is in “advanced” talks to settle private claims against it in a trial to determine blame for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill, the oilfield services company said on Monday, as it booked a $1 billion pretax charge for a possible deal. Disclosure of the “court-facilitated” talks in the last month, which some legal experts tracking the BP trial linked to a series of missteps with evidence presented by Halliburton lawyers in the courtroom, helped push its shares up nearly 6 percent. The news came only days after the end of court proceedings for the first phase of the trial over claims brought by the U.S. government, Gulf Coast states, and private parties affected by the worst U.S. offshore oil spill. The second phase, due to start in September, will address exactly how much oil spilled. While Halliburton is not the subject of direct federal government actions, BP Plc has tried to hold Halliburton and rig owner Transocean Ltd partly responsible for damages in the case. Even with a private claims settlement, the exact scope of Halliburton’s liability will be unclear until the conclusion of the multi-district litigation consolidated under Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans. Halliburton carried out the cement work on the Macondo well, which spilled more than 4 million barrels of oil after the blowout which destroyed the Deepwater Horizon rig and killed 11 workers. “Over the past month or so, we have participated in court facilitated settlement discussions with some of the parties included in the multi-district litigation, with a goal of resolving a substantial portion of the private claims against us in this matter,” Chief Financial Officer Mark McCollum told analysts on a conference call. The company was not immediately available to comment further. Halliburton had a rough time at the trial over the past month. First, it belatedly introduced cement samples into evidence. Then the company’s lawyers produced documents late and prompted Judge Barbier to say he found their handling of the matter “troubling,” with a threat of sanctions. Legal experts following the case, speaking privately, said the developments only added to the urgency of a settlement deal. Halliburton believed an “early and reasonably valued” resolution was in the best interests of shareholders, and its most recent offer included cash components payable over time as well as stock, Chief Executive David Lesar said. “Discussions are at an advanced stage but have not yet resulted in a settlement,” Lesar said, explaining what amounts to an after-tax charge of $637 million, which pushed the company to a loss for the first quarter. The charge is based on where Halliburton is in the negotiations, Lesar said. It is on top of a first-quarter 2012 charge of $191 million after taxes, or $300 million before taxes. The $1.3 billion reserve does not include any potential insurance recovery. McCollum told the analysts the reserve may be revised up or down, but executives declined to take further questions about the possible settlement or trial on the call. Shares of Halliburton, the world’s second-largest oilfield services company, rose 5.6 percent to $39.29 on Monday. “A Macondo settlement would be a significant positive for the stock,” said UBS analyst Angie Sedita, adding that Halliburton also got a lift in the first quarter from higher-than-expected earnings in North America. The company reported a first-quarter loss of $13 million, or 1 cent per share, compared with year-earlier earnings of $635 million, or 69 cents per share. Excluding the charge and other items, it made a profit of 62 cents per share, ahead of the 57 cents analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 1.5 percent to $6.97 billion. Revenue outside North America grew 21 percent, and Halliburton said it had delivered better growth internationally than its two rivals over the past year. On Friday, sector leader Schlumberger Ltd and third-ranked Baker Hughes Inc posted higher-than-expected earnings. Oilfield companies’ pricing power, especially for equipment used in hydraulic fracturing, has collapsed in North America as the number of U.S. rigs targeting natural gas edges away from a 14-year low. But Baker Hughes said on Friday that the declines in fracking equipment rates were starting to taper off. Halliburton weighed in on Monday, saying pricing in general might increase this year as customers adopt new technology to improve well production and the “intensity” of services provided per well increases, even as the rig count rises only modestly. “We believe the worst of the pricing pressure is behind us,” said Chief Operating Officer Jeff Miller.

135,HAL,Nabors struggles in oversupplied fracking market,"(Reuters) - A profit warning from Nabors Industries Ltd (NBR.N) highlights the struggles facing smaller companies as they get squeezed by bigger oil patch rivals such as Halliburton Co (HAL.N) in an oversupplied U.S. land drilling market. Nabors shares fell 6 percent on Wednesday after it said second-quarter earnings would be short of market estimates. Nabors said much of the shortfall was due to reduced rentals of pressure pumping equipment used in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. “The North American pressure pumping market appears to remain one of ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ with the larger, diversified service companies starting to approach full utilization and the smaller competitors still feeling the pain of an oversupplied market,” Barclays analyst James West said in a note to clients. Nabors’ stock has been the worst performer among the sector’s top companies this year. It is now up only 4 percent year to date, while Halliburton is up 27 percent. Shares of Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N and Schlumberger (SLB.N), which offer more diversified services than Nabors and also have a bigger presence in the offshore drilling market, have risen 20 percent and 10 percent respectively. Analysts believe bigger companies with better technology will have an edge in capturing market share, even as the pressure pumping market recovers. West expects the margins of the larger companies to recover as onshore drilling activity increases in the coming months. Smaller companies would start to benefit only toward the end of the year, he said. The nearest rival of Nabors in pressure pumping, FTS International, had to withdraw its initial public offering late last year. [ID:nL1E8MSFNK] The market has not yet shown much sign of improvement for FTS either, with debt rating agency S&P; expecting its core earnings to decline by 19 percent in 2013. Bermuda-based Nabors acquired its pressure pumping fleet, the sixth-largest in North America, through its acquisition of Superior Well Services in 2010. Helmerich & Payne Inc (HP.N), Nabors’ most direct rival, focuses solely on drilling rig contracting, not pressure pumping. Nabors said second-quarter operating income would be in the range of $88 million to $91 million, falling short of market estimates. First-quarter operating income was $109.2 million. Analysts said it was the third time in three years that Nabors, which faces seasonal flux in the colder climates where it works, has warned on second-quarter profits. The warning also caps a challenging 2013 for the company behind the scenes, after an investor that took a 9.3 percent stake forced a board shake-up in April and put the management’s strategy under public scrutiny. Another mid-sized player, Basic Energy Services Inc (BAS.N), on Wednesday reported an improvement in service utilization in June compared with May, with oil-driven markets better than gas markets, even as overall pricing remained competitive. “We anticipate further modest improvements in demand through the third quarter, in both oil and gas markets,” Chief Executive Ken Huseman said. Renting out rigs remains the core business of Nabors, with drilling and rig services making up 70 percent of its revenue. The number working in North America has been capped as oil and gas companies cut costs by using more efficient rigs. Drilling efficiencies and an even-more muted natural gas outlook could leave the U.S. rig count flat for two years, Jefferies & Co analysts said on Tuesday, while downgrading their rating on Helmerich & Payne. West, who has an “equal weight” rating on Nabors shares, cut his price target by $1.00 to $15. Analysts at CLSA cut their rating to “under perform” from “outperform” and their price target by $3.00 to $17. Guggenheim Securities analyst Michael Lamotte cut his price target to $16 from $17, while maintaining his “neutral” rating. Nabors shares were down 6 percent at $15.00 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

137,HAL,Busy global oilfields shield Halliburton from U.S. gas glut,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N) on Monday delivered a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as it found greater success outside its natural gas-engorged home market in the United States. The world’s second-largest oilfield services company also said it boosted its share repurchase program by $4.3 billion after buying $1 billion worth of its shares in the second quarter and leaving only $700 million authorized from an existing program set up in 2006. Chief Executive Dave Lesar said the refreshed $5 billion buyback reflected growing confidence in the outlook as he predicted further profit margin improvement in North America. Analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt said the buybacks would grab as much attention as the results, though Halliburton shares fell 1.1 percent to $45.32 on Monday after a strong run in recent months. “We do not believe the market is yet fully appreciating its solid and growing international footprint,” Sterne Agee analyst Stephen Gengaro wrote. The Houston-based company reported a drop in second-quarter profit to $679 million, or 73 cents per share, from $737 million, or 79 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts expected 72 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 1 percent to $7.3 billion. “Relative to our primary competitors, we have delivered leading year-over-year international revenue growth for five consecutive quarters,” Lesar said in a statement. On Friday, sector leader Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) posted higher-than-expected earnings on greater international exposure, in stark contrast to U.S.-anchored Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N. A collapse in pricing for hydraulic fracturing services has weighed on all players as natural gas drillers have cut back in response to weak gas prices, but U.S. activity is showing signs of recovery. Barclays has seen a 4 percent rise in drilling permits in June in the 30 states it surveys, and the U.S. gas-directed rig count is rising. Analysts worried about a slump in the fourth quarter, when exploration and production budgets start to empty out, though Lesar believes higher oil prices should lead to “budget reloading.” He expected profit margin improvement to continue in North America after a 1.2 percentage-point rise to 17.5 percent over the second quarter. The U.S. gas rig count fell to an 18-year low of 353 in June, even as the count outside North America climbed to its highest in 30 years, according to Baker Hughes data. Halliburton highlighted more activity and sales in Malaysia, China and Angola, while saying that Latin America should bounce back after a disappointing first half. Halliburton shares are up 23 percent in the last three months, versus 18 percent for Schlumberger and 10 percent for Baker Hughes. Halliburton got a big boost in April, when it revealed talks to settle its liability related to the massive 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill. The company said the talks slowed recently because BP Plc (BP.L), operator of the blown-out well, has been in a legal battle over a separate settlement of claims with people and businesses in the Gulf states.

141,HAL,Halliburton pleads guilty to destroying Gulf oil spill evidence,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co has agreed to plead guilty to destroying evidence related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday. The government said the guilty plea is the third by a company over the spill, and requires the world’s second-largest oilfield services company to pay a maximum $200,000 statutory fine. Halliburton also made a separate, voluntary $55 million payment to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the Justice Department said. Halliburton also agreed to three years of probation, and to continue cooperating with the criminal probe into the April 20, 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. Court approval of the settlement is required. A Halliburton spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The disaster caused 11 deaths and triggered the largest U.S. offshore oil spill following the rupture of the Macondo oil well, which was 65 percent owned by BP Plc. Halliburton had earlier provided cementing services to help seal the well. According to the government, Halliburton recommended to BP that the Macondo well contain 21 centralizers, metal collars that can improve cementing, but BP chose to use six. The government said that, during an internal probe into the cementing after the blowout, Halliburton ordered workers to destroy computer simulations that showed little difference between using six and 21 centralizers. Efforts to forensically locate the simulations were unsuccessful, the government said. A document detailing the allegations was filed with the U.S. District Court in New Orleans. BP and Transocean Ltd previously entered guilty pleas related to other aspects of the Gulf oil spill. Neither immediately responded to requests for comment. The case is U.S. v.

142,HAL,UPDATE 1-Halliburton pleads guilty to destroying Gulf spill evidence,"* Third company to plead guilty over Gulf spill * Halliburton to pay $200,000 fine * $55 million to be donated to fish and wildlife group July 25 (Reuters) - Halliburton Co has agreed to plead guilty to destroying evidence related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday. The government said the guilty plea is the third by a company over the spill, and requires the world’s second-largest oilfield services company to pay a maximum $200,000 statutory fine. Halliburton also made a separate, voluntary $55 million payment to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the Justice Department said. Halliburton also agreed to three years of probation, and to continue cooperating with the criminal probe into the April 20, 2010 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. Court approval of the settlement is required. A Halliburton spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The disaster caused 11 deaths and triggered the largest U.S. offshore oil spill following the rupture of the Macondo oil well, which was 65 percent owned by BP Plc. Halliburton had earlier provided cementing services to help seal the well. According to the government, Halliburton recommended to BP that the Macondo well contain 21 centralizers, metal collars that can improve cementing, but BP chose to use six. The government said that, during an internal probe into the cementing after the blowout, Halliburton ordered workers to destroy computer simulations that showed little difference between using six and 21 centralizers. Efforts to forensically locate the simulations were unsuccessful, the government said. A document detailing the allegations was filed with the U.S. District Court in New Orleans. BP and Transocean Ltd previously entered guilty pleas related to other aspects of the Gulf oil spill. Neither immediately responded to requests for comment. The case is U.S. v.

143,HAL,Halliburton plea may help BP in spill liability battle,"(Reuters) - BP Plc appeared to gain an edge in the battle over liability for the 2010 Gulf of Mexico spill on Friday, after Halliburton abandoned one of its arguments that tried to paint the British oil company as unconcerned about well safety. Halliburton, which did the cementing work for BP’s well, on Thursday pleaded guilty to destroying evidence of internal tests it conducted showing there was no difference between the effectiveness of putting six or 21 casing centralizers on the well. Centralizers help stabilize the well bore during cementing and, prior to the settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, Halliburton had sought in court proceedings to pin blame on BP for the blowout because of its decision to save “time and money” by using only six centralizers. A payment of just $200,000 to the Department of Justice ends the DOJ’s case against Halliburton. At the same time, the plea seems to hurt Halliburton as it seeks to settle its share of private claims over the disaster, currently estimated at $1.3 billion. John Coffee of Columbia Law School said it would now be less plausible for Halliburton to argue in any litigation between the two companies that it had warned BP about something for which the evidence was destroyed. “This is a zero sum game between BP and Halliburton, particularly when it undercuts (Halliburton’s) argument they had an honest theory of why the cement wouldn’t hold,” Coffee said. “If it’s an honest theory, why would you destroy all the evidence?” Nonetheless, Halliburton shares rose nearly 4 percent on Friday, since its plea announcement late on Thursday coincided with it unveiling a $3.3 billion share buyback. Scott Gruber, analyst at Bernstein Research, said the company appeared more confident its oil spill liability was manageable in making a repurchase offer that would represent 8 percent of its outstanding shares at current prices. James West at Barclays believed Halliburton could even issue new debt to accelerate its buyback program. “Though we think a resolution of the Macondo liability is likely required before (Halliburton) makes any significant changes to its capital structure,” he added in a note to investors. Halliburton, BP and rig owner Transocean Ltd are all defendants in a federal civil trial that began in February to apportion blame and set damages for Macondo. The trial, under Judge Carl Barbier, is scheduled to resume on Sept 30. According to Margaret Thomas at Louisiana State University’s law school, Barbier could admit Halliburton’s criminal admission in the case and respond in number of ways, including monetary sanctions. She said he could even go so far as to strike Halliburton’s pleadings. “That’s incredibly rare and it’s a last resort that happens in very few cases, but he is empowered to do it,” she said. The disaster caused 11 deaths and led to the largest U.S. offshore oil spill. BP and Transocean previously entered guilty pleas and agreed to pay respective criminal fines of $1.26 billion and $400 million. Both declined to comment on the Halliburton plea. The civil penalties and damages are expected to run into the many billions of dollars, on top of what BP has already spent on clean-up and compensation. BP is struggling through a separate legal battle over the payment of claims to people and businesses for spill-related losses. A federal appeals court is considering the case, and Halliburton said this process was impeding its push to settle its own liability through talks. “The pace of those settlement discussions has recently slowed as we understand BP is challenging certain provisions of its settlement,” Halliburton said in a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. Halliburton also disclosed that its legal fees and other expenses related to Macondo totaled $223 million, of which $190 million is covered by insurance. The company said that last quarter it reached a favorable agreement with some insurers that allows it to continue being reimbursed for covered legal costs. The prospects of a global settlement of the civil litigation by all parties seems remote, since Barbier has not yet ruled on whether BP or its co-defendants were guilty of gross negligence. Some observers believe he will not issue findings on negligence until the trial’s next stage ends, probably in early 2014.

144,HAL,Halliburton pleads guilty to destroying Gulf spill evidence,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co has agreed to plead guilty to destroying evidence related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday. The government said Halliburton’s guilty plea is the third by a company over the spill and requires the world’s second-largest oilfield services company to pay a maximum $200,000 statutory fine. Halliburton also agreed to three years of probation and to continue cooperating with the criminal probe into the April 20, 2010, explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. Court approval is required. Houston-based Halliburton also made a separate, voluntary $55 million payment to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the Justice Department said. Edward Sherman, a Tulane University law professor, said the plea could suggest weakness in Halliburton’s position in negotiating a settlement over spill-related liabilities. “Their willingness to plead to this may also indicate that they’d like to settle up with the federal government on the civil penalties,” he said. “It may indicate a softening of their position.” Halliburton confirmed in a statement that it pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge and confirmed the plea agreement’s terms. The disaster caused 11 deaths and triggered the largest U.S. offshore oil spill following the rupture of the Macondo oil well, which was 65 percent owned by BP Plc.

Both declined to comment on the Halliburton plea. Halliburton, BP and Transocean are also defendants in a federal civil trial that began in February to apportion blame and set damages for the oil spill. The first witness for Halliburton, cementing service coordinator Nathaniel Chaisson, had testified that he was concerned about BP’s use of just six centralizers. The trial is scheduled to resume in September. Halliburton said in April it was in talks to settle private claims against it in the damages trial. The case is U.S. v.

145,HAL,Halliburton sees earnings hurt by Colorado floods: UBS,"(Reuters) - U.S. oilfield services company Halliburton Co (HAL.N) expects recent flooding in Colorado to hurt third-quarter earnings by as much as 3 cents per share, according to a research note from UBS. “(Halliburton) expects hit of $0.02 in Q3 on flooding in Colorado; could rise to $0.03,” UBS wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. Halliburton’s Chief Financial Officer Mark McCollum made the forecast when addressing UBS’ Houston Energy Symposium, the note said. Halliburton did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the McCollum’s comments. Floods that have devastated north-central Colorado, killing eight people and displacing thousands, have also disrupted oil and gas operations. The most severely impacted energy region is known as the Denver-Julesburg basin, centered in eastern Colorado and stretching into southeast Wyoming, western Nebraska and western Kansas.

147,HAL,Halliburton pleads guilty to destroying Gulf spill evidence,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Halliburton Co pleaded guilty on Thursday to federal charges of destroying evidence, stemming from its role in the 2010 BP oil disaster that killed 11 men and sent more than 4 million barrels of oil spewing into the Gulf of Mexico. A former Halliburton cementing technology director in Texas also was charged on Thursday with destroying evidence. U.S. District Judge Jane Triche Milazzo in New Orleans accepted the company’s guilty plea from Halliburton legal counsel Marc Mukasey, imposed the agreed-upon maximum fine of $200,000 and placed the company on a three-year probation term. Mukasey did not make a statement on the company’s behalf. The Macondo disaster, the worst-ever offshore oil spill in U.S. history, so far has cost BP about $42.4 billion in charges on its balance sheet from payouts, cleanup and restoration costs and ongoing litigation. The plea deal with Halliburton was first announced by the company and the U.S. Department of Justice on July 25. The U.S. Justice Department revealed the single count of destroying evidence filed against the former Halliburton manager, Anthony Badalamenti, of Katy, Texas, on Thursday. In its plea, Halliburton admitted to the misdemeanor charge of “intentionally causing damage without authorization to a protected computer.” Halliburton provided cementing services for BP at the ill-fated Macondo drilling operation. Those services included placing “centralizers,” or huge plugs, at various points in piping as it was placed inside the drilled well. Centralizers help ensure cement properly seals a well. Halliburton had recommended BP use 21 centralizers in the Macondo well, and BP chose to use six. Halliburton later claimed that if BP had followed its recommendation to use more, the well would have been more stable. According to court documents, the government alleged that in May 2010, as part of Halliburton’s review of the disaster, Badalamenti directed another manager to run computer simulations comparing performance of 21 centralizers with that of six. In June that year, Badalamenti allegedly directed a second manager to run a similar comparison. Both times, the simulations indicated there was little difference between use of 21 centralizers as opposed to six. Prosecutors allege that both times, Badalamenti ordered the managers to delete the simulation results from their computers, and both complied. The judge noted that a company executive had directed employees to preserve material related to Macondo. In an ongoing, multi-phase civil trial over the cause of the well explosion in federal court in New Orleans, both the government and BP contend that faulty cement work by Halliburton contributed to the disaster. BP also contends that Halliburton destroyed computer evidence that would have shown those errors.

150,HAL,"BP knew 2010 U.S. Gulf spill was risk, lawyers tell trial","NEW ORLEANS, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Long before the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, BP knew its Macondo well could explode and then lied about how much oil leaked, plaintiffs’ lawyers said at the opening of the second phase of the company’s trial on Monday. The British oil major is fighting to hold down fines that could hit $18 billion at the trial in New Orleans, which will determine responsibilities for the worst marine pollution disaster in the United States. “BP refused to spend any time or money preparing to stop a deepwater blowout at its source,” said Brian Barr, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, which include people affected by the spill, the U.S. government and Gulf states. “BP then made the situation worse,” Barr said. “By lying about the amount of flow from the well.” In response, a lawyer for BP told the U.S. District Court that the company followed U.S. spill preparation standards. The second phase of the trial, expected to last a month, is focused on how much oil spewed from the well and whether a series of efforts BP made to cap it over 87 days were adequate. “BP had a response plan that was fully consistent with U.S. standards for spill preparedness,” said a BP lawyer, Mike Brock. “BP did not misrepresent the flow rate in a way that caused a delay in the shut in of the well. It made reasonable decisions based on what was known at each step along the way.” In the costliest scenario the fines under the Clean Water Act could reach $17.6 billion - an amount well beyond the $42 billion BP has so far set aside for clean-up, compensation and damages. The first phase of the trial, which wrapped up in April, looked at dividing blame among BP and its contractors, Transocean Ltd and Halliburton Co, for the disaster that left 11 men dead and huge stretches of sea and coast fouled with oil. The U.S. government says 4.9 million barrels were spilled in the worst offshore disaster in U.S. history in April 2010. BP says 3.26 million barrels leaked from the well during the nearly three months it took to cap the blowout at the Deepwater Horizon rig. Both those totals include 810,000 barrels that were collected during clean-up that the judge has agreed to exclude. Judge Carl Barbier is not expected to assign penalties for BP until early next year in the third phase of the trial. Under the Clean Water Act, negligence can be punished with a maximum fine of $1,100 for each barrel of oil spilled; a gross negligence verdict carries a potential $4,300 per barrel fine. If the court judged the spill to have been 4.09 million barrels - the government estimate less oil recovered - the price of negligence could reach $4.5 billion. Gross negligence could run to $17.6 billion. BP shares have lost a third of their value since the disaster, as the company hived off $39 billion of assets that generated $5 billion a year in cashflow - or about a fifth of its earning power - before 2010.

151,HAL,"At trial, BP denies dithering during response to U.S. Gulf spill","NEW ORLEANS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Dithering and indecision at BP Plc delayed the capping of its Macondo well and worsened the extent of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, according to allegations by plaintiffs’ lawyers at trial on Tuesday that the British company denied. On day two of the second phase of a trial in New Orleans  over billions of dollars in potential fines, witnesses said they were surprised when BP abandoned one proposed method of plugging the well, which would have put a new blowout preventer on top of a similar device. “It was BP’s decision,” said Robert Turlak, an engineer from Transocean Ltd who worked on the well-capping team. “We were so close, we’d come a long way ... We had the equipment ready.” It eventually took 87 days to plug the well as a series of different capping methods were tried. By then, millions of barrels of oil had escaped into the sea and fouled coastlines in the worst offshore spill in U.S. history. BP lawyer Paul Collier fended off allegations of indecisiveness, saying the company carefully assessed hazards and discussed how to mitigate risks associated with numerous plugging options. He also said BP’s well-capping team had a mantra of “don’t make things worse.” Lawyers for the plaintiffs - which include people affected by the spill, the U.S. government and Gulf states, and former contractors Transocean and Halliburton Co - have sought to show that BP’s estimates on the size of the leak were unsubstantiated and complicated its efforts to cap the well. At one point after the April 2010 spill, BP touted the chances of stopping with leak with a so-called top kill that pumped heavyweight drilling mud into the well. But that did not work - frustrating U.S. officials at the time. “I believed the words (BP Senior Vice President) Kent Wells used, that this is a slam dunk,” former U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in a videotaped deposition played in court on Monday about the top kill. After that, “we began to be much more critical about what BP planned to do,” Chu said. Eventually, a “capping stack” that took weeks to build was used to shut the well. Capping stacks have since become crucial pieces of equipment standing by for emergencies in the Gulf. BP has insisted its response after the blowout that killed 11 men was fully consistent with U.S. standards and that it never misrepresented the amount of oil spewing from the well. The second phase of the trial in U.S. District Court in New Orleans, expected to last a month, covers how much oil spewed from the well and whether efforts to stop it were adequate. Internal company emails presented at the trial on Monday showed BP saying publicly after the spill that 5,000 barrels of oil a day were leaking into the ocean when it knew up to 100,000 barrels a day could have been leaking. In the costliest scenario the fines under the Clean Water Act could reach nearly $18 billion - an amount beyond the $42 billion BP has set aside for clean-up, compensation and damages. The first phase of the trial, which wrapped up in April, looked at dividing blame among BP and its contractors; Transocean owned the drilling rig and Halliburton did cement work on the well. The U.S. government says 4.9 million barrels were spilled, while BP says 3.26 million barrels leaked. Both those totals include 810,000 barrels that were collected during clean-up that the judge has agreed to exclude. BP shares have lost a third of their value since the disaster, partly because of uncertainty over future fines. The company has shed about $39 billion in assets to cover most of its provisions, but damages could rise. Under the Clean Water Act, negligence can be punished with a maximum fine of $1,100 for each barrel of oil spilled; a gross negligence verdict carries a potential $4,300 per barrel fine. If the court judged the spill to have been 4.09 million barrels - the government estimate less oil recovered - the price of negligence could reach $4.5 billion. Gross negligence could run to $17.6 billion. Moody’s Investors Service said on Tuesday that BP’s credit ratings could tolerate a moderate penalty under the Clean Water Act but warned that “a severe penalty resulting from a finding of gross negligence could change the equation.” Judge Carl Barbier has said he will not assign penalties for BP until the third phase of the trial, expected early next year.

152,HAL,UPDATE 1-BP's well control exec says he was unprepared for U.S. Gulf blowout,"By Kathy Finn NEW ORLEANS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - BP’s manager in charge of controlling the Macondo blowout in 2010 was never trained to permanently plug a ruptured oil well and said in court on Wednesday the British company was not fully prepared for the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. On day three of the second phase of a federal trial in New Orleans over the accident in the Gulf of Mexico, BP’s James Dupree also said “yes” when asked if the company was “starting from scratch” when it scrambled to stop the leak. The U.S. District Court trial could lead to fines of more than $17 billion. BP lawyer Mike Brock sought to show the company was as well-prepared for the leak as any other firm. He also emphasized that equipment needed to cap the well was not readily available in the industry at the time. The plugging approach that eventually worked after millions of barrels of oil leaked over 87 days, a “capping stack,” took weeks to build. Capping stacks have since become crucial pieces of equipment standing by for emergencies in the Gulf as the government has tightened safety and environmental standards. “I had no formal training in well-kill operations,” Dupree told the court, referring to the operation of plugging a well. He called the blowout an unprecedented worst-case scenario. “We didn’t have the equipment to attack a Macondo-type event, that’s why we had to engineer so many things on the fly.” “We didn’t have the preparations we have today,” he said. The company’s lawyers also sought to reject a central argument made by plaintiffs - which include the U.S. government, Gulf states and former contractors Transocean and Halliburton Co - that BP’s estimates of the size of the leak were unsubstantiated and complicated efforts to control the well. Internal company emails presented at the trial have shown BP saying publicly that 5,000 barrels of oil a day were leaking into the ocean when it knew up to 100,000 barrels a day could have been leaking. Dupree said his team was nearly sure at one point that an early capping attempt known as a “top kill” was working - only to be dealt a stinging setback when they realized the well was still gushing. “We thought we had killed the well...There was a celebration in the room,” he said. After the failure of the top kill, which pumped heavyweight drilling mud into the well and then put junk material on top of it, BP became concerned that too much weight would cause the well to breach. That prompted them to scrap another option, known as “BOP on BOP,” that would have put a blowout preventer on top of a similar device. Plaintiffs have suggested “BOP on BOP” would have ended the leak sooner than the capping stack BP finally installed. Dupree said safety was a concern when responding to the blowout that killed 11 men. “I’m really proud of my team,” Dupree said. “We executed all those operations and nobody else got hurt,” he told the court. BP’s team stressed that the company’s actions during the spill response were coordinated with the approval of government officials and that many of its team members were trained to control wells. Asked if BP was prepared, Lars Herbst, a top regulator for the Gulf, said he believed the company was “prepared to initially respond” to the blowout and later on “technology and procedures were developed to address that situation.” This phase of the trial, expected to last a month, covers how much oil spewed from the well and whether efforts to stop it were adequate. In the costliest scenario, the fines under the Clean Water Act could top $17 billion - an amount beyond the $42 billion BP has set aside for clean-up, compensation and damages. The company has shed about $39 billion in assets to cover most of its provisions. But damages could rise and BP shares have lost a third of their value since the disaster, partly because of uncertainty over future fines.

153,HAL,BP's well control exec says was unprepared for U.S. Gulf blowout,"NEW ORLEANS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - BP’s manager in charge of controlling the Macondo blowout in 2010 was never trained to permanently plug a ruptured oil well and said in court on Wednesday the British company was not fully prepared for the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. On day three of the second phase of a federal trial in New Orleans over the accident in the Gulf of Mexico, BP’s James Dupree also said “yes” when asked if the company was “starting from scratch” when it scrambled to stop the leak. The U.S. District Court trial could lead to fines of more than $17 billion. BP lawyer Mike Brock sought to show the company was as well-prepared for the leak as any other firm. He also emphasized that equipment needed to cap the well was not readily available in the industry at the time. The plugging approach that eventually worked after millions of barrels of oil leaked over 87 days, a “capping stack,” took weeks to build. Capping stacks have since become crucial pieces of equipment standing by for emergencies in the Gulf as the government has tightened safety and environmental standards. “I had no formal training in well-kill operations,” Dupree told the court, referring to the operation of plugging a well. He called the blowout an unprecedented worst-case scenario. “We didn’t have the equipment to attack a Macondo-type event, that’s why we had to engineer so many things on the fly.” “We didn’t have the preparations we have today,” he said. The company’s lawyers also sought to reject a central argument made by plaintiffs - which include the U.S. government, Gulf states and former contractors Transocean and Halliburton Co - that BP’s estimates of the size of the leak were unsubstantiated and complicated efforts to control the well. Internal company emails presented at the trial have shown BP saying publicly that 5,000 barrels of oil a day were leaking into the ocean when it knew up to 100,000 barrels a day could have been leaking. Dupree said his team was nearly sure at one point that an early capping attempt known as a “top kill” was working - only to be dealt a stinging setback when they realized the well was still gushing. “We thought we had killed the well...There was a celebration in the room,” he said. After the failure of the top kill, which pumped heavyweight drilling mud into the well and then put junk material on top of it, BP became concerned that too much weight would cause the well to breach. That prompted them to scrap another option, known as “BOP on BOP,” that would have put a blowout preventer on top of a similar device. Plaintiffs have suggested “BOP on BOP” would have ended the leak sooner than the capping stack BP finally installed. Dupree said safety was a concern when responding to the blowout that killed 11 men. “I’m really proud of my team,” Dupree said. “We executed all those operations and nobody else got hurt,” he told the court. This phase of the trial, expected to last a month, covers how much oil spewed from the well and whether efforts to stop it were adequate. In the costliest scenario, the fines under the Clean Water Act could top $17 billion - an amount beyond the $42 billion BP has set aside for clean-up, compensation and damages. The company has shed about $39 billion in assets to cover most of its provisions. But damages could rise and BP shares have lost a third of their value since the disaster, partly because of uncertainty over future fines. The first phase of the trial, which wrapped up in April, looked at dividing blame among BP and its contractors; Transocean owned the drilling rig and Halliburton did cement work on the well. The U.S. government says 4.9 million barrels were spilled, while BP says 3.26 million barrels leaked. Both those totals include 810,000 barrels that were collected during clean-up that the judge has agreed to exclude. Under the Clean Water Act, negligence can be punished with a maximum fine of $1,100 for each barrel of oil spilled; a gross negligence verdict carries a potential $4,300 per barrel fine. If the court judged the spill to have been 4.09 million barrels - the government’s estimate less oil recovered - the price of negligence could reach $4.5 billion. Gross negligence could run to $17.6 billion. U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier has said he will not assign penalties for BP until the third phase of the trial, expected early next year.

154,HAL,UPDATE 1-BP tells court it did not dither in response to U.S. Gulf spill,"* Trial concerns a potential near $18 bln in fines for BP * Plaintiff lawyers argue BP leak estimates unsubstantiated * BP lawyer says company carefully assessed hazards, options By Kathy Finn NEW ORLEANS, Oct 1 (Reuters) - BP Plc unnecessarily delayed the capping of its Macondo well and worsened the extent of the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill through dithering and indecision, according to allegations by plaintiffs’ lawyers on Tuesday that the British company denied. In the second phase of a trial in New Orleans over billions of dollars in potential fines, lawyers for the plaintiffs - the U.S. government, Gulf states and former contractors Transocean and Halliburton Co - also sought to show BP’s estimates of the size of the leak were unsubstantiated and caused delays by complicating efforts to cap the well. In the costliest scenario, fines under the Clean Water Act could reach nearly $18 billion - an amount beyond the $42 billion BP has set aside for clean-up, compensation and damages. Witnesses on day two of the trial said they were surprised when BP abandoned one proposed way to plug the well, which would have put a new blowout preventer on top of a similar device. “It was BP’s decision,” said Robert Turlak, an engineer from Transocean Ltd who worked on the well-capping team. “We were so close, we’d come a long way ... We had the equipment ready.” It eventually took 87 days to control the well as a series of different capping methods were tried. By then, millions of barrels of oil had escaped into the sea and fouled coastlines in the worst offshore spill in U.S. history. BP lawyer Paul Collier fended off allegations of indecisiveness, saying the company carefully assessed hazards and discussed how to mitigate risks associated with numerous plugging options. Collier said BP’s well-capping team had a mantra of “don’t make things worse” and experts who testified for BP said the method favored by Turlak was not ready. At one point after the April 2010 spill, BP touted the chances of stopping the leak with a so-called top kill that pumped heavyweight drilling mud into the well. But that did not work - frustrating U.S. officials at the time. “I believed the words (BP Senior Vice President) Kent Wells used, that this is a slam dunk,” former U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in a videotaped deposition played in court on Monday about the top kill. After that, “we began to be much more critical about what BP planned to do,” Chu said. Eventually, a “capping stack” that took weeks to build was used to shut the well. Capping stacks have since become crucial pieces of equipment standing by for emergencies in the Gulf. BP has insisted its response after the blowout that killed 11 men was fully consistent with U.S. standards and that it never misrepresented the amount of oil spewing from the well. James Dupre, who was in charge of BP’s well control efforts at the time, said the company consulted with experts across the oil industry on how to best cap the well. He said options were  evaluated simultaneously, not one after another, so as not to delay decision-making. The first phase of the trial, which wrapped up in April, looked at dividing blame among BP and its contractors; Transocean owned the drilling rig and Halliburton did cement work on the well. The second phase of the trial in U.S. District Court in New Orleans, expected to last a month, covers how much oil spewed from the well and whether efforts to stop it were adequate. Internal company emails presented at the trial on Monday showed BP saying publicly after the spill that 5,000 barrels of oil a day were leaking into the ocean when it knew up to 100,000 barrels a day could have been leaking. The U.S. government says 4.9 million barrels were spilled, while BP says 3.26 million barrels leaked. Both those totals include 810,000 barrels that were collected during clean-up that the judge has agreed to exclude. BP shares have lost a third of their value since the disaster, partly because of uncertainty over future fines. The company has shed about $39 billion in assets to cover most of its provisions, but damages could rise. Under the Clean Water Act, negligence can be punished with a maximum fine of $1,100 for each barrel of oil spilled; a gross negligence verdict carries a potential $4,300 per barrel fine. If the court judged the spill to have been 4.09 million barrels - the government estimate less oil recovered - the price of negligence could reach $4.5 billion. Gross negligence could run to $17.6 billion. Moody’s Investors Service said on Tuesday that BP’s credit ratings could tolerate a moderate penalty under the Clean Water Act but warned that “a severe penalty resulting from a finding of gross negligence could change the equation.” Moody’s also said there is uncertainty over what BP’s final bill will be from a settlement agreement reached last year with the Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee (PSC) - an uncapped system funded by BP that pays out money to tens of thousands of people and business affected by the spill. The cost of that deal was estimated at $7.8 billion but BP has revised it upwards to $9.6 billion and has complained that the settlement administrator is paying out far more generously than he was meant to in compensating the likes of fishermen, hoteliers and others making a living along the Gulf coast. BP has filed numerous challenges to the settlement to Barbier and a higher court - so far without success. It has also sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for being banned from bidding for new federal fuel contracts or new Gulf of Mexico drilling licences. Despite the Macondo spill, BP is still the biggest single holder of licences in the Gulf. Environmentalists have criticized the flurry of filings by the company and newspaper adverts it has run complaining about the high costs of the settlement agreement, along with television commercials BP has run urging tourists to return to the Gulf coast for fishing and birdwatching. Judge Carl Barbier has said he will not assign penalties for BP until the third phase of the trial, expected early next year.

155,HAL,Halliburton manager pleads guilty to destroying Gulf spill evidence,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - A Halliburton Co (HAL.N) manager formally pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court on Tuesday to destroying evidence in connection with the oilfield services company’s role in the BP (BP.L) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The plea by Anthony Badalamenti, former cementing technology director, was submitted a month after Halliburton also pleaded guilty to similar charges over the deletion of computer simulations of the stability of the ill-fated Macondo well. Halliburton provided cementing services for BP at the Macondo drilling operation - including the placement of “centralizers,” or huge plugs, at various points in piping as it was placed inside the drilled well. Centralizers help ensure cement properly seals a well. Halliburton had recommended BP use 21 centralizers in the Macondo well, and BP chose to use six. Halliburton later claimed that if BP had followed its recommendation to use more, the well would have been more stable. According to court documents, the government alleged that in May 2010, as part of Halliburton’s review of the oil spill which began in April and was plugged in July, Badalamenti directed another manager to run computer simulations comparing performance of 21 centralizers with that of six. In June that year, Badalamenti allegedly directed a second manager to run a similar comparison. Both times, the simulations indicated there was little difference between use of 21 centralizers as opposed to six. Prosecutors allege that both times, Badalamenti ordered the managers to delete the simulation results from their computers, and both complied - even though a company executive had asked employees to preserve material related to the well. The Macondo accident killed 11 workers and the government says 4.9 million barrels of oil spilled into the sea. It took 87 days to contain the well. In an ongoing, multi-phase civil trial over the cause of the well explosion in federal court in New Orleans, both the government and BP contend that faulty cement work by Halliburton contributed to the disaster. BP also contends that Halliburton destroyed computer evidence that would have shown those errors.

157,HAL,Halliburton tops estimates on foreign oilfield strength,"(Reuters) - Buoyant oilfield activity in Russia, Saudi Arabia and Angola helped Halliburton Co (HAL.N) narrowly beat expectations on Monday with a 17 percent rise in third-quarter profit, but its shares slipped since its main competitors did even better. The world’s second-largest oilfield services company has been chasing opportunities outside its traditionally dominant U.S. market to better take on larger rival Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), which also topped estimates with quarterly profits. “Our Eastern Hemisphere growth continues to lead our peer group,” Halliburton Chief Executive Dave Lesar said. “Consistent with prior years, we expect the fourth quarter in the Eastern Hemisphere to be our strongest quarter of the year due to seasonal year-end software and equipment sales.” The international expansion has come at a cost. Lesar said the company has invested close to $1 billion in recent years in a new Singapore facility and technology centers in Houston, Saudi Arabia and Brazil. Third-quarter net profit rose to $706 million, or 79 cents per share, from $602 million, or 65 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue rose 5 percent to $7.47 billion. Excluding restructuring charges, the company reported earnings of 83 cents per share, a penny above analysts’ average forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Halliburton executives warned last month of the restructuring impact along with a profit reduction of 2 to 3 cents per share due to flooding in Colorado oilfields. The company said revenue grew 2 percent in North America despite the floods, while adjusted operating income climbed 4 percent on a seasonal recovery in Canada and deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Halliburton expects some of the logistical challenges from the flooding to linger into the current quarter. Along with Schlumberger, rival Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N posted higher-than-expected earnings on Friday, boosted by offshore drilling and activity outside North America. Analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt said the strength of the results from its two rivals may have been raised the bar a bit for Halliburton. Sterne Agee analyst Stephen Gengaro summed up the quarter as “no major surprises” but reiterated his “buy” rating on Halliburton shares and a price target of $63. Shares of Halliburton fell nearly 2 percent to $51.44. The stock had risen 41 percent in the previous six months, compared with 34 percent for Schlumberger and 27 percent for Baker Hughes. Based on conversations with clients, Lesar said he expected client spending to increase in 2014 even though it may not show up in the rig count because customers were pushing hard to do more with less at well sites. Baker Hughes expects the U.S. rig count it compiles to average 1,750 rigs for 2013, down 9 percent from 2012, although the industry is drilling about 6 percent more wells per rig. On the other hand, the international count was expected to average 1,300 rigs in 2013, up 5 percent.

159,HAL,Halliburton raises dividend as it trims oilfield costs,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N) on Wednesday increased its dividend by 20 percent as the oilfield services company laid out plans to boost North American profit margins by 2 percentage points next year through cost reductions alone. Halliburton shares jumped 2 percent after the dividend announcement at a meeting between company executives and analysts. Pricing in the North American oilfield market remains competitive due to spare service capacity, as a natural gas production glut forced operators to scale back plans, the executives said. But they said Halliburton, the regional market leader, has invested in efficiency improvements and plans to raise margins in the region by 2 percentage points over the course of 2014 from 17.8 percent last quarter, part of a 5 point increase over three years. Any improvements to margins from higher pricing or rising rig counts in North America would come on top of that rise, Chief Executive Dave Lesar explained. “The five points is just going to come from the efforts we outlined today,” he said, calling the push a “multiple-year pay-off” for the business. “We have some 30,000 employees in North America - this is not a trivial exercise.” Halliburton said it would raise the dividend to 15 cents per share for the fourth quarter. The ensuing 2 percent rise in the company’s stock price came on top of a 5 percent rise in the two weeks ahead of the analyst meeting. The increased payout is part of the company’s ultimate goal of returning 35 percent of its operating cash flow to shareholders, Chief Financial Officer Mark McCollum said. Halliburton, the No. 2 oilfield services company worldwide behind Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), also aims for a return on capital employed of 20 percent in 2016, compared with an estimated 11 percent for this year. Among other goals, executives committed to tripling the revenue Halliburton earns from its mature fields business to $9 billion by 2016, while expanding in deepwater at least 25 percent faster than the market growth rate. Eric Carre, senior vice president for drilling and evaluation, cited industry estimates for deepwater market growth of 11 percent annually through 2018, with 62 percent of the new wells to be drilled in the so-called Golden Triangle: Brazil, West Africa and the Gulf of Mexico. Over the past three years, Carre said the deepwater market’s compound annual growth rate was 13 percent, against 31 percent for Halliburton. To achieve that, it invested $1 billion and increased its Golden Triangle staff by 35 percent. McCollum said a move toward generating a majority of the company’s revenue outside North America would help shave another 1 to 1.5 percentage points off its effective tax rate, after reducing it by 3 percentage points this year. In its home market, Halliburton spelled out the huge potential for efficiency improvements by giving the example of one fracking crew. It said that in handling 332 fracking stages, the crew used 888 truck-loads of proppant, a mix of sand or ceramic spheres used to crack the rock and pry it open freeing up the hydrocarbons. The crew also used 200 rail cars and 52 million gallons of fluid. Halliburton’s “frac of the future” effort that it is rolling out requires 35 percent less personnel and cuts completion time by 40 percent, instead of the 25 percent it had targeted, while reducing maintenance costs by half.

163,HAL,U.S. justices to hear Halliburton securities class action,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court, which in recent years has ruled for business in a string of high-profile cases, agreed on Friday to hear a case that could herald a dramatic decline in securities class action litigation. The case will give the justices an opportunity to re-appraise a 25-year-old precedent, Basic v. Levinson, that made it easier for securities class action cases to go beyond the preliminary certification stage. Shareholders, led by the Erica P. John Fund Inc, sued Halliburton Co (HAL.N), saying the company understated its asbestos liabilities while overstating revenues in its engineering and construction business and the benefits of its merger with Dresser Industries. Halliburton sought Supreme Court review after losing in lower courts. In the 1988 case, the court ruled that investors did not have to prove that their loss could be directly traced to the alleged fraud. Instead, the court held that any misrepresentation about a security would be incorporated into the market price. Any investor who purchased the security at that time could be presumed to have been directly affected by the misrepresentation. The ruling effectively launched the securities class action industry that exists today, according to Adam Pritchard, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. “Overruling ‘Basic’ would scale back securities class actions tremendously,” he said. Jay Brown, a professor at the University of Denver, Sturm College of Law, said it would be bad news for investor plaintiffs if the court required them to show they actually relied on false statements when making investment decisions. “It will make securities class actions almost impossible to pursue,” he said. Several former members of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the court to take the case. “At issue in this case is the viability and scope of the most powerful engine of civil liability ever established in American law,” their attorney, George Conway, wrote in reference to the “fraud-on-the-market” theory. There were 3,050 private securities class action cases between 1997 and 2012 leading to settlements worth more than $73.1 billion, the brief stated. Conway said in an interview that the court’s decision to hear the case was a consequential development. “It’s simply unlikely that the Supreme Court took this case with an eye to leaving ‘Basic’ in place,” he said. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers also asked the court to hear the case. Aaron Streett, one of Halliburton’s lawyers, said in an email that his team is “confident that we will prevail” after the court hears oral arguments, likely in February. Lead plaintiffs’ attorney David Boies declined to comment. Four of the nine current justices have indicated concerns about the “fraud-on-the-market” theory. Justice Samuel Alito said the court should consider overruling the 1988 case in a separate opinion he wrote after concurring with the majority in a securities class action case decided in February in favor of plaintiffs, Amgen v. Connecticut Retirement Plans. Three other justices dissented in that case. Alito wrote in his opinion that there was recent evidence the “fraud-on-the-market” theory “may rest on a faulty economic premise.” The Halliburton case returns to the court for a second time. In January 2011, the court unanimously ruled that a U.S. appeals court erred in rejecting class certification. The lawsuit was filed in 2002 on behalf of all buyers of Halliburton stock between June 1999 and December 2001. The alleged misstatements artificially pumped up Halliburton’s stock price, the lawsuit said, adding that the Houston-based company eventually made corrective disclosures that caused its stock price to fall. After the first Supreme Court ruling, Halliburton argued that the class could still not be certified because the alleged fraud did not affect the stock price.

164,HAL,UPDATE 3-U.S. justices to hear Halliburton securities class action,"By Lawrence Hurley and Jonathan Stempel Nov 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court, which in recent years has ruled for business in a string of high-profile cases, agreed on Friday to hear a case that could herald a dramatic decline in securities class action litigation. The case will give the justices an opportunity to re-appraise a 25-year-old precedent, Basic v. Levinson, that made it easier for securities class action cases to go beyond the preliminary certification stage. Shareholders, led by the Erica P. John Fund Inc, sued Halliburton Co, saying the company understated its asbestos liabilities while overstating revenues in its engineering and construction business and the benefits of its merger with Dresser Industries. Halliburton sought Supreme Court review after losing in lower courts. In the 1988 case, the court ruled that investors did not have to prove that their loss could be directly traced to the alleged fraud.

169,HAL,"UPDATE 3-Halliburton, Baker Hughes see slight pickup in N.America","* Halliburton adj profit $0.93/share vs est $0.89 * Baker Hughes adj profit $0.62/share vs est $0.61 * Baker Hughes shares up about 2 pct * Halliburton shares down 3 pct on weak forecast for LatAm activity By Swetha Gopinath and Garima Goel Jan 21 (Reuters) - Oilfield service companies Halliburton Co  and Baker Hughes Inc said they expect an improvement in North American margins, driven by a modest pickup in onshore activity and strong deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Halliburton and Baker Hughes, No. 2 and No. 3 in the industry, have been expanding outside the United States and Canada, where excess capacity and a drop in the number of rigs drilling for natural gas has eaten into margins. Strong activity in international markets, particularly the Middle East and Africa, helped both companies report stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Baker Hughes shares rose about 2 percent in morning trade. Shares of Halliburton, which initially rose on the results, fell 3 percent after the company said in a conference call that conditions would remain tough in Latin America. Halliburton said it was targeting an improvement of 200 basis points in North American margins in 2014, while Baker Hughes said it expected margins in the region to recover by at least 105 basis points in the first quarter. Halliburton, which expects 2014 revenue in North America to increase by a mid-single-digit in percentage terms, said the average U.S. land rig count was likely to increase modestly this year. Baker Hughes, which publishes a closely watched tally of active rigs, said it expected the U.S. onshore rig count to be essentially flat this year, but added that the well count would rise by 5 percent due to improved drilling efficiencies. Oilfield service companies are able to secure more business despite no growth in rig count as greater efficiency allows clients to drill more wells with a single rig. Baker Hughes said increased profitability in North America would offset a seasonal decline in its international and industrial businesses in the first quarter. The company said it expected first-quarter earnings to rise “slightly” from fourth-quarter adjusted earnings, excluding the impact of disruptions in Iraq. Baker Hughes temporarily suspended operations in southern Iraq in November, following protests over an alleged religious insult by a security adviser working in the area for competitor Schlumberger Ltd, whose operations were also disrupted. Halliburton said it expected a seasonal decline in first-quarter revenue in Latin America and that margins there would be more “severe than normal” due to higher costs in Brazil and reduced land drilling in Mexico. Falling output from older offshore oil fields in Brazil along with delays in bringing on new areas is weighing on drilling activity in the country. Halliburton expects margins for the Latin American region, which accounted for 13 percent of operating income in the fourth quarter, to stay in the upper single digits until activity begins to recover in the back half of the year. Fourth-quarter operating income from Latin America fell 21 percent, while revenue was flat at $1 billion. “We believe that 2014 will be a very challenging year for Latin America,” Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Miller said on a conference call with analysts. Both Halliburton and Baker Hughes received nearly half of their revenue from outside North America in the fourth quarter. Halliburton forecast double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2014, citing strong international demand. “Halliburton’s bullish outlook for 2014 should ease some concerns about the outlook for global E&P; (exploration and production) spending in 2014,” Barclays analysts said in a note to clients. Barclays expects oil and gas companies to spend about $723 billion on exploration and production this year, an increase of 6.1 percent from 2013, according to a report released last month. Baker Hughes said it expected the international rig count to grow by 10 percent this year. Baker Hughes said its revenue from Middle East and Asia Pacific jumped 27 percent in the quarter, while Halliburton’s revenue from the same regions climbed 13 percent. Most of their gains in the Middle East are coming from Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, which is lining up dozens of rigs this year to make up for supply disruptions in other countries, including Iran, Libya, Nigeria and Yemen. Market leader Schlumberger, which gets almost 70 percent of its revenue from outside North America, posted a better-than-expected profit on Friday thanks to robust drilling activity in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Baker Hughes said revenue from its operations in Europe, Africa, Russia and the Caspian region combined rose 10 percent in the fourth quarter. Halliburton’s revenue from the same areas rose 15 percent. Halliburton’s income from continuing operations rose 31 percent to $770 million, or 90 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. Revenue rose 5 percent to $7.64 billion. Adjusted income from continuing operations was 93 cents per share. On that basis, analysts on average had expected earnings of 89 cents on revenue of $7.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to Baker Hughes rose 16 percent to $248 million, or 56 cents per share, in the quarter. Revenue rose 10 percent to $5.86 billion. Excluding one-time items, Baker Hughes earned 62 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 61 cents on revenue of $5.67 billion. Halliburton shares have risen 35 percent in the past year, while Baker Hughes shares have risen 27 percent. The broader Philadelphia oil service index has risen 17 percent.

174,HAL,"U.S. securities class-action settlements rebound, may not last","(Reuters) - The number and size of U.S. securities class-action settlements rose in 2013, a new study shows, but the gains may not last if the U.S. Supreme Court limits investors’ ability to band together to bring lawsuits. Sixty-seven settlements worth $4.77 billion, the highest dollar amount in six years, won court approval in 2013, up from 57 settlements worth $3.26 billion a year earlier, according to the study released on Thursday by Cornerstone Research. Large settlements skewed the data, with more than half of the payout attributable to Bank of America Corp’s $2.43 billion settlement of claims it misled shareholders when buying Merrill Lynch & Co in late 2008. The peak years remain 2005 and 2006, when accords over WorldCom Inc’s and Enron Corp’s collapses led to respective overall settlement totals of $10.93 billion and $19.89 billion. But the median settlement - meaning half were larger and half smaller - was just $6.5 million in 2013, down from $10.3 million a year earlier, reflecting the diminishing impact of lawsuits related to the global financial crisis. Settlements over $50 million were three times more likely to have corresponding U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement actions, and four times more likely to have public pension plans as lead plaintiff, than smaller accords. Cornerstone said the number of settlements is unlikely to decline much soon, reflecting the “relatively high” number of recent lawsuits alleging misrepresentations or inadequate disclosures. The number of securities lawsuits seeking class action status rose 9 percent last year to 166. But the Supreme Court could change much of that. In Halliburton Co v. Erica P. John Fund, the court is weighing changes to a 1988 precedent that said shareholders may pursue class actions by relying on a presumption that company stock prices reflect all publicly available information. This “fraud on the market” theory frees shareholders from showing individually that they relied on false statements, and underpinned the subsequent boom in securities class actions. At oral argument on March 5, some justices showed sympathy for what Justice Anthony Kennedy called a “midway position,” in which the court would not overrule the precedent but instead require investors to show that a particular misrepresentation meaningfully affected a stock’s price. “If the ruling in Halliburton severely limits investors’ ability to get large-scale class actions certified, the future of such cases is up in the air,” Joseph Grundfest, a Stanford Law School professor who works with Cornerstone, said in a statement.

176,HAL,Halliburton expects margins to rebound in North America,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the world’s No.2 oilfield services provider, expects margins to improve in North America after being depressed for two years as companies step up spending to drill and complete wells. Halliburton’s shares rose as much as 5 percent to a life high after the company forecast a 25 percent jump in earnings in the current quarter, in line with market expectations. “I am more excited about North America now than I have been since late 2011,” Halliburton Chief Executive Dave Lesar said on a conference call with analysts on Monday. “Supportive commodity prices today are translating into stronger cash flow in operating budgets for our customers...,” he said. Rivals Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N also spoke of improved markets in North America after posting better-than-expected quarterly profits on Thursday. Weak natural gas prices had dragged down drilling activity in North America, intensifying competition among oilfield services providers for a smaller number of contracts. Halliburton, which also reported better-than-expected results, said excess capacity in hydraulic fracking equipment used in shale fields had tightened much faster than expected, at least in Texas’s Permian Basin. “We don’t think we’ll have any problem filling our frac calendar through the end of the year,” Lesar said on the call. The company said the tightening could also help it get bigger jobs and pass on some increased prices to customers. Halliburton said it expected further increases in earnings beyond the second quarter due to the recovery in North America and strong drilling activity in international markets. “We believe that there is going to be a healthy recovery in profitability levels for the services industry as activity continues to grow in the shale world,” said Sanford C. Bernstein & Co analyst Scott Gruber. Halliburton forecast a low-to-mid single digit improvement in revenue in percentage terms in North America and said margins would return to levels last seen in the second half of 2013. The expected rise in drilling activity onshore United States would more than offset a seasonal halt to drilling in Canada in spring, Chief Financial Officer Mark McCollum said on the call. Analysts said the forecast 25 percent growth in second-quarter profit ending June would translate to 91 cents per share, in line with the average estimate. The company, traditionally dominant in the United States, has been making a big push into international markets to combat the weakness in North America in recent quarters. Revenue and operating income increased 13 percent in the Middle East and Asia region in the first quarter. Revenue in Europe, Africa and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) rose 9 percent, while operating income jumped 21 percent. Revenue fell 9 percent in Latin America, while operating income declined 8 percent due to reduced drilling activity in Brazil and Mexico. Revenue increased 5 percent, while operating income was flat in North America. The company said operations in the region were hurt by lower prices for pressure pumping services, higher logistics costs and disruptions in drilling due to the harsh weather. Net income attributable to Halliburton was $622 million, or 73 cents per share, in the first quarter, compared with a loss of $18 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier.

However, thus far the earnings season has been mixed, with technology names like Google Inc  and IBM struggling to impress investors. * With fewer than one-fifth of S&P; 500 companies having reported results so far, about 63 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, exceeding the 56 percent average over the past four quarters. About 52 percent have beaten revenue forecasts, about even with the 54 percent average over the past four quarters. * Hasbro Inc reported adjusted first-quarter earnings that topped forecasts, though revenue was below expectations. Halliburton Co also reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. * Advanced Micro Devices rose 9.5 percent to $4.04 in premarket trading. Late Thursday, the last session before the Good Friday trading holiday, the chipmaker posted first-quarter results that beat expectations. * Perhaps the most eagerly awaited name on Monday is Netflix Inc, which will report after the market closes. The online movie renter was recently a trading favorite, soaring 300 percent last year as the S&P; 500’s biggest percentage gainer. The stock, stung by claims it is overvalued, has slumped recently alongside a broader decline in other recently high-flying names. Analysts will look to see whether the results justify its still-elevated price. * S&P; 500 futures rose 0.8 point and were slightly above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added 7 points and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 12.25 points. * The S&P; 500 and Nasdaq are coming off four-day winning streaks, and investors may look to take profits on any disappointing corporate news. * Dozens of S&P; components will report this week, including such closely watched names as Apple Inc, Biogen Idec  and Facebook Inc. A number of Dow components, including McDonald’s Corp, AT&T; Inc, Procter & Gamble and Caterpillar Inc, also report. * In company news, Britain’s Sunday Times reported that Pfizer Inc had approached AstraZeneca to propose a $101 billion takeover, an offer that was reportedly rejected. However, Astra’s cancer drug pipeline is still considered a draw for Pfizer. Shares of Pfizer, a Dow component, rose 1.5 percent to $30.70 before the bell while U.S. shares of Astra rose 5.7 percent to $67.11. * Last week the Dow rose 2.4 percent, the S&P; 500 added 2.7 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 2.4 percent. The Dow had its best week since December while the S&P; 500 closed out its best week since July. The CBOE Volatility index, a measure of investor anxiety, fell 21.6 percent over the week, its biggest weekly drop since January 2013.

180,HAL,Indonesia restricts foreign investment in oil services industry,"* New rules not to impact projects already underway * Could take as long as 5 years to fully implement * Halliburton, McDermott, China Oilfield among firms operating in country By Wilda Asmarini and Randy Fabi JAKARTA, May 5 (Reuters) - Indonesia has introduced new regulations restricting foreign investment in drilling, maintenance and construction in the oil industry, in an effort to give domestic firms an opportunity to better compete, government officials confirmed on Monday. The nationalistic policies were introduced as part of a major overhaul to foreign investment rules, which President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Friday said was a way to attract overseas investors. In a 100-page document released late on Friday, it eased foreign investment regulations for several industries including pharmaceuticals, large power plants and advertising. But it also introduced limits for foreign ownership of oil platforms, pipelines, maintenance companies, drilling firms and storage. “It is a priority of national interest to increase competitiveness in these industries and to allow national investors (to play a role),” Farah Indriani, deputy chairwoman of investment climate and development, told Reuters. The mining ministry said the new rules would not impact projects already underway and could take as long as five years to fully implement. Halliburton Co, McDermott International, and China Oilfield Services Limited are among the major oil services companies already operating in Indonesia. “It won’t disturb or change any existing contracts,” Naryanto Wagimin, programme director for the oil and gas directorate in the mines ministry, told Reuters. “If it was directly implemented today, maybe no (foreign) drilling companies would do business here,” he added. Under the new rules, foreign ownership of offshore oil and gas drilling services was limited to 75 percent from 95 percent. It also limited foreign ownership in pipeline projects and small power plants between 1-10 megawatts to 49 percent. Previously there was no such limit. Indonesia has steadily imposed regulations to get more control over its natural resources, most recently introducing a mineral ore export ban in January to force miners to process their raw materials in the country. Partly due to the ban, foreign investment growth in the first quarter slowed to its lowest level in nearly five years. The FDI data excludes investment in the oil industry.

181,HAL,UPDATE 1-Venezuela's PDVSA gets $2 bln credit line from oil service companies,"(Adds details on deals, PDVSA’s debt to providers) MARACAIBO, Venezuela, May 21 (Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA on Wednesday said it had been granted a total of $2 billion in credit lines by oilfield services companies Halliburton Co, Schlumberger NV and Weatherford International Ltd. “What we have signed is for the companies to increase activities in our country, in some cases doubling them,” PDVSA President and Energy Minister Rafael Ramirez said at a ceremony in the western city of Maracaibo. By giving credit lines to PDVSA, the companies will be able to increase their service contracts with OPEC member Venezuela. The deal may allow PDVSA, whose cash-flow problems are well known, to postpone payments of accumulated debts to its main service providers. Last year, it signed a similar agreement with Schlumberger after accumulating pending debts of almost $1 billion. PDVSA finances most of the socialist government’s spending and does not receive cash for a third of its crude and products exports due to debt agreements and international supply pacts. In 2012, PDVSA had accumulated $16.5 billion in debts to providers, but it has not released updated numbers since. Ramirez did not say when the new $2 billion credit would be effective or give details of the interest rate agreed.

183,HAL,COLUMN-Halliburton ruling could backfire for defendants: Frankel,"(The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.) By Alison Frankel New York - Let’s state the obvious: Big Business did not get what it wanted Monday from the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused in Halliburton v. Erica P. John Fund to overturn Basic v. Levinson, the 25-year-old precedent that permits shareholders to bring classwide claims of securities fraud. The justices didn’t even adopt the alternate approach — suggested by some Halliburton supporters in friend-of-the-court briefs — of requiring plaintiffs who want to sue as a class to show that supposed corporate misstatements had an impact on share prices. Instead, the court ruled only that defendants may argue against class certification with evidence that share prices didn’t drop as a result of the alleged fraud. Halliburton’s lawyer, Aaron Streett of Baker Botts, told me that’s still a “significant win,” especially considering that the justices might have upheld the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and barred defendants from using such price-impact evidence to keep shareholders from banding together. Streett said that the decision will give defendants a chance to fend off class certification with arguments that their share price didn’t drop at all, or that the drop was attributable to something other than the disclosure of their alleged fraud. But the cost of this small victory for defendants may turn out to be higher than they realize. According to David Boies of Boies, Schiller & Flexner who argued the Supreme Court case for investors — and shareholder lawyers Max Berger of Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann and Lawrence Sucharow of Labaton Sucharow, the Halliburton ruling not only won’t curb securities class action filings but could actually improve plaintiffs’ position after class certification. Here’s why. The Supreme Court’s decision does not give securities defendants a new right: They’ve always been able to argue at various turning points in these cases that their supposed fraud didn’t affect share prices. The Halliburton opinion just clarifies that defendants can use those arguments to oppose class certification. Realistically, said plaintiffs’ lawyer Berger, shareholders in almost all cases will be able to offer their own evidence that corporate misstatements led to drops in stock prices. Even if other factors contributed to the stock drop, Berger said, his side will be able to win class certification if alleged fraud had anything to do with the decline. “This ruling is not going to make our job more difficult,” he told me. “The decision says price impact can be considered at any time. Yeah, so what?” Securities fraud plaintiffs, in other words, are already equipped to counter price impact arguments opposing class certification with evidence from their own economics experts, who will say that share prices fell because of the alleged fraud. (And if investors can’t find experts to support their price impact theories, they should not have brought their cases in the first place.) It’s true, said plaintiffs’ lawyer Sucharow, that if price impact battles take place at the class certification stage rather than in summary judgment briefing, plaintiffs’ lawyers will have to spend more time and money on experts earlier than they’re used to. But the reward for defeating price impact defenses at the class certification stage, he said, will be a better position in post-certification settlement talks: Defendants won’t be able to argue that shareholders can’t prove price impact. There will no longer be uncertainty that defendants might succeed in getting the case tossed on a summary judgment motion based on price impact, Sucharow said, so shareholders will have better leverage in mediation or negotiations. “This decision could mean that the club defendants say I get when I win class certification has become an even bigger club,” Sucharow said. Moreover, Boies pointed out, defendants who decide to raise price impact arguments to oppose class certification will have to face shareholders’ discovery demands on the merits of their defenses. That’s going to expose defendants to depositions and documents requests they won’t welcome, he said. “Plaintiffs are going to get a whole lot more information at the class certification stage,” Boies said. Boies predicted that when securities class action defendants weigh the costs and benefits of price impact arguments against class certification, few will end up asserting them. “This could turn out to be a ‘be careful what you ask for’ decision,” he said. Of course, as Halliburton lawyer Streett told me, we’ll have to wait to assess the impact of the new price impact test for class certification until the lower courts have had a chance to apply it; courts in the 2nd Circuit have been using a version of the test since 2008, Streett said, and have denied “a decent number” of class certifications because shareholders couldn’t show price impact. One early test of the new ruling will come when the 5th Circuit considers the Halliburton case yet again, on its second remand from the Supreme Court. On Monday, both Streett and Boies said they expect to win at the appeals court. Meanwhile, the ever-resourceful securities class action bar is enjoying its new prognosis, after a near-death experience. “Believe me, if this is the sacrifice we make for keeping Basic, we made a great trade,” said Sucharow.

184,HAL,INSIGHT-U.S. high court bucks pro-business trend this term,"(Adds Wednesday’s Supreme Court rulings) By Lawrence Hurley WASHINGTON, June 25 (Reuters) - With only days remaining in its term, the U.S. Supreme Court is on track to at least partly dispel the impression that it is pro-business. In cases brought by business interests over the last nine months, including an effort to curb shareholder class actions and challenges to environmental regulations, the court has either issued narrow rulings that fell short of what those interests sought or ruled against them outright. By contrast, the court last year issued a string of rulings in favor of business, including several that curbed consumer claims against companies. Lawyers and law professors following the business cases offer various explanations for the losses and narrower victories this year. One theory is that the court under Chief Justice John Roberts is reluctant to overturn longstanding precedents, even when they happen to be anti-business. Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland, said the court has shown “it is more a minimalist status-quo court than a ‘pro-business’ court.” By one measure the business community has fared reasonably well this year. Its leading representative before the high court, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has so far amassed a record of 11 wins to 4 losses during the nine-month term due to end next Monday. That’s a winning percentage just slightly lower than last year’s 14-3 record. In the previous year the Chamber went undefeated at 7-0. The Chamber participates mainly by filing friend-of-the-court briefs, but is also directly involved in some cases, such as regulatory challenges. It does not generally participate in business-against-business disputes, such as a case on Wednesday in which the court ruled for TV broadcasters in finding that online startup Aereo Inc had violated copyright law. One remaining case yet to be decided involves the Chamber - a challenge to President Barack Obama’s appointments to the National Labor Relations Board, which has the potential to be a broad ruling. Even a win in that case, due to be decided as early as Thursday, would mean a year of mixed results. The Chamber’s wins have mostly been on technical issues. Even when the court has ruled in favor of business interests this term, the justices have ruled narrowly and rejected arguments that would have led to blockbuster decisions. On Monday, the court did exactly that in cases on securities class actions and environmental regulations. The court stopped short of overturning a precedent that favors plaintiffs in securities class actions and mostly upheld the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gases under a long-running air pollution program. The environmental ruling was so mild that the EPA announced it was pleased with the ruling even though it had technically lost. Monday’s ruling in the environmental case handed a partial win to industry by exempting smaller pollution sources from the regulation. “It wasn’t a perfect win but we think it was a very positive step in the right direction and a shot across the bows of the EPA,” Kate Comerford Todd, a lawyer in the Chamber’s legal office, said in an interview. Saying that “overall it’s a good term for the business community,” Todd cited a January win for Daimler AG  in which the court put limits on the ability of plaintiffs to file human rights claims against multinational companies in U.S. courts. In the securities class action case, which was brought to the court by Halliburton Co, the justices were unanimous in reaching a middle ground that could benefit corporate defendants, but the court didn’t go as far as the business community hoped. Roberts himself wrote the majority opinion in which the court declined to overturn a precedent that favors shareholders, saying Halliburton had failed to show the “special justification” that is required before the court throws out its prior holdings. “We are disappointed,” said Lily Fu Claffee, the Chamber’s chief legal officer. The justices again failed to give the Chamber what it wanted on Wednesday when the high court ruled in a class-action case brought against Fifth Third Bancorp. The court threw out an appeals court ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, giving a technical win to the bank and Chamber. But the court rejected the Chamber’s argument, which would have had broader pro-defendant implications if adopted. The bulk of the Chamber’s outright wins were on technical legal issues, such as a decision in December in favor of Sprint Corp over a dispute with the utilities regulator in Iowa. By contrast, the Chamber lost some higher-stakes cases. Most notably, the court in April upheld a separate environmental regulation proposed by President Barack Obama’s administration that was strongly opposed by utilities. The court, on a 6-2 vote, ruled that the EPA had not exceeded its authority in requiring some states to limit pollution that contributes to unhealthy air in neighboring states. The court also found against the Chamber in a 6-3 vote in March that whistleblower protections apply not only to publicly traded companies but also to subcontractors that do business with them. The ruling extends the protections to investment advisers, law firms, accounting firms and other such businesses. Business also didn’t fare particularly well in seven other cases involving corporate interests in which the Chamber did not participate and that did not involve a company versus company dispute. Business interests lost four out of seven, including one in which the court said on a 7-2 vote that victims of Allen Stanford’s Ponzi scheme could sue lawyers and insurance brokers who worked for him. Doug Kendall, president of the left-leaning Constitutional Accountability Center, said the business community’s failure this year to reach its goals may stem from its having taken “very aggressive positions,” setting its sights too high to garner a majority on the nine-member court. “They didn’t get what they asked for, but they are playing offense,” Kendall said.

187,HAL,"Halliburton's new China JV targets Xinjiang tight oil, gas","BEIJING, July 10 (Reuters) - A newly formed oil service joint venture between a private Chinese firm and U.S. oil service giant Halliburton Co plans to focus on tapping tight oil and gas reserves in China’s remote western region of Xinjiang. China is stepping up development of more difficult-to-extract resources including tight oil and shale gas, leading  more local firms to seek alliances with global oilfield service companies with high-end drilling technology and experience. The latest venture between Halliburton and China’s SPT Energy, known as Xinjiang HTDT, joins similar tie-ups between U.S.-listed Weatherford and China’s Sinopec Group and U.S. fracking giant FTS International with Sinopec. SPT has 20 years experience operating in Xinjiang while Halliburton would contribute its expertise in enhancing oil recovery using fracturing technology,” Sun Xiaogang, SPT’s chief financial officer, told Reuters. “Among the most geographically complicated regions in China, Xinjiang is rich in tight oil and tight gas resources,” he said, adding that the model could be used in other regions. SPT will hold 51 percent and Halliburton 49 percent of the new entity, which will have registered capital of $34 million and commit to a total investment of $100 million, Sun said. The venture was first announced in April.

188,HAL,UPDATE 1-Rebounding North America boosts Schlumberger revenue,"(Adds details from statement, background) July 17 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd’s, the world’s largest oilfield services company, reported better-than-expected second quarter revenue as drilling activity picked up in North America. Revenue from the oversupplied market - where all major oilfield service providers have been competing for fewer contracts - jumped 16 percent to $3.89 billion from a year earlier. Smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc also reported a higher-than-expected profit on strong growth in North America, earlier on Thursday. Schlumberger and Baker Hughes provide several services, including seismic surveys that determine where oil lies under the earth’s surface and hydraulic fracturing of wells. Robust drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico and a rise in onshore drilling in the United States helped offset seasonal weakness in Canada, Schlumberger said in a statement on Thursday. Schlumberger has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers, which include Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc.

189,HAL,Halliburton signals North America demand recovery after two years,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N), North America’s top oilfield services provider, said it would add fracking equipment and crew to take advantage of higher demand in the region, signaling an industry-wide recovery after a two-year slump. Shares of the world’s No.2 oilfield services provider rose 2 percent to a life-high of $72.20 after the company also raised its share repurchase program to $6 billion from $5 billion. Halliburton, like global leader Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), said while there was no impact on business yet due to the U.S. sanctions against Russia, projects being tendered later this year could be impacted. The country contributes in the “low single digit” percentage to Halliburton’s total revenue. “As tensions potentially escalate and the risk of more sanctions sort of looms, that’s what we believe puts some risk into the business in the back half of the year,” Chief Executive David Lesar said on a post-earnings call. Halliburton reported a 20 percent rise in second-quarter profit, meeting Wall Street’s expectations, as drilling activity increased in North America. Halliburton, which gets half its revenue from North America, said it expects margins in the region to touch 20 percent in the current quarter, up from 18.2 percent in the quarter ended June 30.  The company’s margin in the region was higher than Baker Hughes Inc’s BHI.N 12 percent and Schlumberger’s 18 percent. Halliburton said it would “immediately” speed up additions to its crew and hydraulic fracturing fleet as capacity tightened in North America. “I think it is a kind of vote of confidence that demand is on its way back,” said S&P; Capital IQ analyst Stewart Glickman. Prices for hydraulic fracturing, where water, chemicals and sand are blasted into wells to extract oil and gas, have been depressed due to excess equipment and a drop in natural gas drilling, brought on by low prices of the fuel. However, a recent rise in natural gas prices has led to increased drilling, helping boost revenue at Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes.  Halliburton’s revenue from North America rose sequentially to 11 percent in the second quarter – stronger than a 9 percent rise in the eastern hemisphere, where it had been making a strong push to combat the weakness in North America. The weakest region was Latin America, where revenue rose just 4 percent, dragged down by reduced activity, a delayed order and costs related to new projects in Mexico. Margins in the region are expected to improve in the second half, with full-year margins in line with those a year earlier. The company’s revenue rose 10 percent to $8.05 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $7.88 billion.

193,HAL,UPDATE 1-BP asks court to remove claims administrator in Gulf spill case,"(Adds quote from BP, background, separate settlement by Halliburton) HOUSTON, Sept 2 (Reuters) - BP Plc asked a U.S. court on Tuesday to fire the court-appointed lawyer tasked with paying out compensation to people affected by the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, saying the lawyer had not disclosed an alleged conflict of interest before taking the job. The motion in U.S. District Court in New Orleans said the lawyer, Patrick Juneau, lacks neutrality because he had advocated for claimants before the court appointed him to run the claims program. It was the latest in a series of legal challenges filed by the London-based oil major, which has complained previously that Juneau has been too generous and liberal when approving claims. “In order to restore the integrity of the claims program, the court should replace him,” BP said. Juneau has said he is just applying the rules of the 2012 settlement agreement that was approved by U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier. BP originally expected the class-action settlement to resolve economic and health claims by more than 100,000 individuals and businesses to cost $7.8 billion. It has since said the uncapped program could cost $9.2 billion and that this amount could grow. The 1,000-page settlement deal was negotiated by BP and a committee of plaintiffs’ lawyers to avoid individual lawsuits by compensating a wide class of businesses and individuals in one swoop. BP has sustained more than $42 billion in charges from the April 20, 2010, disaster aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig that killed 11 workers in the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. More charges are possible as the trial to determine blame and overall damages from the spill, including those under the federal Clean Water Act, is ongoing. Separately on Tuesday, oilfield services provider Halliburton Co reached a $1.1 billion settlement for claims related to its role in the spill. Halliburton provided cementing services on the blown-out Macondo well. The settlement protects Halliburton from certain punitive damages if the court were to rule later that the company had been “negligent” or “grossly negligent” for its role in the blowout, Chief Financial Officer Mark McCollum said. The case can be found under: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig “Deepwater Horizon” in the Gulf of Mexico, on April 20, 2010, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana, No. 10-md-02179.

194,HAL,Halliburton to settle U.S. Gulf spill claims for $1.1 billion,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N), North America’s top oilfield services provider, said it reached a $1.1 billion settlement for a majority of claims related to its role in BP Plc’s (BP.L) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The settlement, which includes legal fees, is subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, Halliburton said. The amount, to be paid in three installments over the next two years, will be put into a trust until all appeals are resolved, the company said.  “We think this is a smart move by Halliburton,” said Stewart Glickman, an equity analyst at S&P; Capital IQ. “While state claims by Louisiana and Alabama remain, we think this trims legal overhang.” Halliburton, whose shares were marginally lower on Tuesday, had set aside $1.3 billion for costs related to the incident. The Macondo well blowout and rig explosion in April 2010 killed 11 people and spilled millions of barrels of oil for 87 days after the blast. The settlement protects Halliburton from certain punitive damages if the court were to rule later that the company had been negligent or ‘grossly negligent’ for its role in the blowout, Chief Financial Officer Mark McCollum said. A decision is awaited from U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans ascertaining the extent of negligence of BP, Halliburton and rig contractor Transocean Ltd (RIG.N). Transocean agreed last year to pay $1.4 billion to settle U.S. government charges for its role in the disaster. BP, which also faces potential fines under the Clean Water Act in the United States, has so far paid about $28 billion. “BP has claims against us for contribution for their exposure under the Clean Water Act,” McCollum said at the Barclays CEO energy-power conference on Tuesday. “We do not think that stands the legal test because we are not under maritime laws.” Halliburton provided cementing services for BP at the well, including the placement of “centralizers” that help stabilize the well bore during cementing. The company had earlier blamed BP’s decision to use only six centralizers - to save “time and money” - for the blowout.

200,HAL,Halliburton sees no slowdown in drilling despite crude slide,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the world’s No.2 oilfield services provider, said there were no signs of a slowdown in drilling activity despite the recent 25 percent fall in oil prices. Halliburton’s shares rose about 2.5 percent in early trading after the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its quarterly dividend. “We believe industry fundamentals suggest that these lower prices are not sustainable,” Chief Executive Dave Lesar said on a post-earnings call.  Oil supply and demand would be back in balance in a “relatively short period of time”, he said. North American customers and national oil companies have not indicated that activity levels will slow down, Lesar said. Halliburton’s comments echo those of rivals Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N.     Market leader Schlumberger said it expected increased oil and gas spending in 2015 due to a rise in global demand, while Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N said clients would rethink projects only if oil fell to and remained at $75 for a few months.  Oilfield services companies are unlikely to be hurt by sluggish prices in the near term because most of their operations are contract-based, analysts said. Roughly 2.6 million barrels per day of world crude oil production comes from projects with a breakeven price in excess of $80 per barrel, the International Energy Agency said. This represents less than 3 percent of global third-quarter production of 93.2 million barrels per day. Brent touched a four-low of $82.60 on Thursday, before recovering on Friday. It was down 1.65 percent at $84.73 at 10:51 a.m. ET on Monday.

Baker Hughes, the world’s No.3 oilfield services provider,  said at the Barclays CEO Energy Power conference last month that it had “significantly” increased the number of its railcars and is buying more sand under contract, which helps buffer it against price rises. Companies are pumping in as much as a trainload of frac sand into a single well to coax more oil and gas from shale rocks. But the shale rush, especially in Texas and North Dakota, coupled with a rail jam that began after last year’s severe winter has resulted in shortage of sand at drilling sites. “We did experience some disruptions early in the third quarter, where work was delayed because we were waiting on sand deliveries,” Halliburton’s Chief Executive David Lesar said on the company’s post-earnings call on Monday. Halliburton has committed about $100 million this year to upgrade its infrastructure to move frac sand. The company signed up 30 additional trucking companies this year to transport sand, Jeffrey Miller, Halliburton’s president, said on Monday. It has also opened a center in Houston to monitor supply and track its rail and trucking fleets, he said. Halliburton is also buying more sand under contract, which it said helped shave 15-20 percent off spot sand costs. “Halliburton has probably been the most proactive in establishing a ‘just-in-time’ inventory system for most of their frac sand products because it is becoming such a logistical game,” said Societe Generale analyst Edward Muztafago, who has a “buy” rating on the stock. Halliburton and Baker Hughes are beefing up their transportation networks to also shield themselves from the increase in costs to move sand, which is adding to already high sand prices. Prices for various grades of sand increased by between 5 percent and 20 percent past year, said Taylor Robinson, president of commodity logistics consulting firm PLG Consulting. For example, Robinson said, sand delivered from Illinois to the Eagle Ford shale field in Texas costs $127 per ton on average, with transportation and warehousing accounting for nearly two-thirds of that. “I think there’s going to be a limit to how much of these additional cost escalations our customers are prepared to take, given their free cash flow situation and also given the drop in oil prices,” Schlumberger Ltd CEO Paal Kibsgaard said during the company’s earnings call on Friday. The world’s largest oilfield services company said last week that oil and gas spending would increase in 2015 as global oil demand was poised to rise, downplaying fears of an investment slowdown due to weak crude prices. Schlumberger did not respond to emails and calls requesting comment for the story. Baker Hughes declined to comment. Several sand miners are also stepping up investments in their transportation networks, which they use to deliver sand to companies such as Halliburton. U.S. Silica Holdings Inc, which has about 30 transloading terminals for transferring sand from railcars to trucks, plans to invest about $300 million to expand its logistics network by 2020, CEO Bryan Shinn said. U.S. Silica is constructing “one of the largest transloading facilities in the country” in the Permian Basin, he said, and expects to add another 15-20 locations in the next few years.

204,HAL,Iraq approves $278 mln oil deal with Halliburton,"BAGHDAD, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Iraq’s cabinet approved on Monday a $278.5 million drilling deal with U.S. oil service company Halliburton for the southern West Qurna- 1 oilfield, according to a government statement. Under the 30-month contract, Halliburton is to drill 30 oil wells in the 8.7-billion-barrel West Qurna Phase One field, operated by  U.S. major ExxonMobil, the statement said. Oil production at the West Qurna-1 field is running at a rate of 360,000 barrels per day due to problems with low levels of water injection, which is needed to boost production, officials said. Iraq has awarded lucrative oilfield development contracts to majors such as Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Exxon Mobil with the ambitious target of expanding its oil production capacity to 8.5-9 million bpd by 2017. Increasing export capacity is a cornerstone of Iraq’s ambitious plans to revive its oil industry after years of war, economic sanctions and neglect. Iraq wants to jump into the top ranks of global oil producers and exporters.

205,HAL,Baker Hughes says in talks with rival Halliburton,"(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Halliburton Co and rival Baker Hughes Inc are in preliminary talks on a potential merger, Baker Hughes said in a statement on Thursday. The statement said the discussions “may or may not lead to any transaction” but two people familiar with the matter said  Halliburton was in talks to buy Baker Hughes. Any potential deal between the two Houston-based companies could run into antitrust concerns. “Baker Hughes Incorporated today confirmed that it has engaged in preliminary discussions with Halliburton Company regarding a potential business combination transaction,” the statement said.  Halliburton declined to comment on the talks, which were first reported by Dow Jones and in The Wall Street Journal. The people familiar with the matter spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. Oil prices have slid by a third since June, eroding demand for drilling services and pummeling stock prices across the energy sector. That has prompted a flurry of chatter among executives and bankers about acquisition opportunities. A tie up between the No. 2 and No. 3 players in the services industry might allow them to better weather the downturn and resist pressure from producers to slash prices.     A potential merger would create a drilling, logistics and well services giant worth $67 billion, initially with 140,000 employees. But the merged entity would be only half the size of industry leader Schlumberger, which has a market capitalization of $125 billion. If a deal were struck, the companies could well have to sell assets to convince regulators they would not hurt competition, said Seth Bloom, a veteran of the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust division now in private practice. “The question with mergers like this is are there divestitures of submarkets that can solve the problem,” Bloom said. “It’s clearly not a slam dunk to approval but it’s not automatic that you can’t get it through. You have to drill down to see what the markets are like.” The deal is also likely to draw the scrutiny of regulators in Europe, China, Brazil and Mexico, others experts said. Arguably, the antitrust concerns would be greatest outside the United States, where there are relatively few services companies.

The energy sector cut its losses late in the session after Dow Jones reported Halliburton is in talks to buy Baker Hughes. Halliburton ended up 1 percent after earlier falling as much as 4.6 percent, while Baker Hughes rallied to close up 15.3 percent at $58.75. They were, however, the only two stocks to finish higher in the energy sector of the S&P; 500, which closed down 1.3 percent. Energy shares fell as Brent crude slid below $78 a barrel while U.S. crude tumbled 3.6 percent to $74.39, both at their lowest in more than four years. Wal-Mart closed up 4.7 percent at $82.94 after posting higher same-store sales for the first time in seven quarters. It earlier hit a high of $83.06. “Wal-Mart is showing strength, showing the natural relation it should have with (lower) energy prices,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. Consumer-related companies are expected to see more demand as lower gasoline costs free up cash. “But while we’re waiting for (other) consumer stocks to rise, lower energy prices continue to be a headwind,” Hogan said. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 40.59 points, or 0.23 percent, to 17,652.79, the S&P; 500 gained 1.08 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,039.33 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 5.01 points, or 0.11 percent, to 4,680.14. Despite the slight gains, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE 1,974 to 1,085, for a 1.82-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,800 issues fell and 893 advanced for a 2.02-to-1 ratio.

213,HAL,Proposed merger of oilfield firms poses challenge to Schlumberger,"(Reuters) - The proposed merger of oilfield service companies Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc would create a serious challenger to Schlumberger NV in international markets and cement the two companies’ dominance in North America. And that is the problem, according to some analysts. “The proposed merger would be dominant in North America, which could spur protracted (antitrust) scrutiny; and likely elicit howls of protest from customers everywhere, potentially requiring concessions to more than one national anti-trust authority,” analysts at FBR Capital Markets wrote in a note. Baker Hughes disclosed after the market closed on Thursday that it was in preliminary merger talks with its Houston neighbor. But muted market reaction on Friday highlighted the likelihood that any deal would face an uphill regulatory battle. Baker Hughes’ shares were up 0.2 percent in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange while Halliburton’s were up 1.4 percent. Schlumberger’s stock was up 0.4 percent. A combined Halliburton-Baker Hughes would have combined revenue of about $52 billion, based on 2013 results, outstripping Schlumberger’s 2013 revenue of $45.3 billion. The merged company’s business in North America would also be about double that of Schlumberger, which gets more than two-thirds of its revenue from international operations. Still, the merged entity’s market value of about $70 billion would be far less than Schlumberger’s $120 billion. Baker Hughes, whose shares were trading at $58.38 at midday, should be able to command a 25 percent premium to its Wednesday close of $50.98 for an enterprise value of $25.46 billion, Evercore ISI analyst James West said in a note. The proposed deal would give Halliburton, the No. 2 oilfield services provider, the leading market share in oilfield services such as directional drilling, coiled tubing and drill-bits, unseating Schlumberger in all three markets, said West. A deal would not be all bad news for Schlumberger, however. Analysts said that by reducing the number of big players in  the industry to two from three, pricing could stabilize. “Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes have been in a knife fight the past few years for international and offshore tenders,” Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co analysts said. “A combined company could help introduce more discipline to these bid processes and ultimately improve returns/profits for the industry.”  ",11142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bakerhughes-halliburton-research/proposed-merger-of-oilfield-firms-poses-challenge-to-schlumberger-idUSKCN0IY24H20141114

A stronger dollar and decline in gasoline prices affected a trio of economic reports on Friday as overall retail sales rose more than expected while U.S. import prices fell in September by the most in more than two years. In addition, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment for this month came in at 89.4, the highest since July 2007, buoyed by falling unemployment and gas prices. “It’s a consolidating day and everyone is focused on oil, what is oil telling us here?” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. “Is it going down because of a price war, or is it going down because of the prospects of the global economy slowing even further?” Brent crude was up 2.5 percent at $79.40 a barrel, bouncing from a four-year low, while U.S. crude advanced 1.4 percent to $75.22. While the Dow and S&P; have continued to set record highs, recent gains have been modest, with the S&P; 500 yet to post a gain of at least 1 percent this month. The benchmark S&P; index is on pace for a fourth straight weekly gain. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.04 points, or 0.01 percent, to 17,650.75, the S&P; 500 gained 1.05 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,040.38 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 3.34 points, or 0.07 percent, to 4,683.48. The S&P; 500 is up 0.4 percent for the week and has rallied 9.5 percent from a six-month low in October, buoyed by supportive economic data and corporate earnings. For the year so far, it is up 10.3 percent. Baker Hughes gained 0.3 percent to $58.90. The oilfield services company said it was in preliminary merger talks with larger rival Halliburton Co, which was little changed at $53.75. Virgin America Inc, a low-cost airline partly owned by Richard Branson, soared as much as 28 percent in its market debut, underscoring the buoyant mood in an industry that is seeing relief from lower oil prices. Shares were last up 27.5 percent to $29.33. Geron Corp surged 26.4 percent to $2.92 after it licensed its cancer compound to a Johnson & Johnson unit for up to $935 million.

221,HAL,UPDATE 4-Baker Hughes says in preliminary merger talks with rival Halliburton,"(Adds details on product lines, Weatherford share spike; adds HOUSTON/NEW YORK dateline, adds byline) By Terry Wade and Nadia Damouni HOUSTON/NEW YORK Nov 13 (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes Inc said on Thursday it is in preliminary merger talks with its larger rival Halliburton Co , though any potential deal would likely face antitrust concerns. Two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Halliburton was looking to buy Baker Hughes, in what would be the second-largest energy deal of this year. Oil prices have slid by a third since June, eroding demand for drilling services and pummeling stock prices across the energy sector. That has prompted a flurry of chatter among executives and bankers about acquisition opportunities. A tie up between the No. 2 and No. 3 players in the services industry might allow them to better weather the downturn and resist pressure from oil producers to slash prices. Baker Hughes said in a statement it has “engaged in preliminary discussions with Halliburton Company regarding a potential business combination transaction.” Halliburton declined to comment on the talks, which were first reported by Dow Jones and in The Wall Street Journal. A potential merger would create a drilling, logistics and well services giant worth $67 billion, initially with 140,000 employees. But the merged entity would be only half the size of industry leader Schlumberger, which has a market capitalization of $125 billion. If a deal were struck, the companies could well have to sell assets to convince regulators they would not hurt competition, said Seth Bloom, a veteran of the U.S. Department of Justice’s antitrust division now in private practice. “The question with mergers like this is are there divestitures of submarkets that can solve the problem,” Bloom said. “It’s clearly not a slam dunk to approval but it’s not automatic that you can’t get it through. You have to drill down to see what the markets are like.” The deal is also likely to draw the scrutiny of regulators in Europe, China, Brazil and Mexico, others experts said. Arguably, the antitrust concerns would be greatest outside the United States, where there are relatively few services companies. There are at least seven major product lines where there is overlap between the two companies. The companies offer scores of services and technology, from drill bits, to cementing and casing work, to artificial lift systems that improve output from wells. An analyst who follows the company and did not want to be quoted said Halliburton could get the deal down with a mix of debt and equity and still maintain its investment rating. News of the talks sent shares of another services company,  Weatherford International Plc, which has long been seen as vulnerable, up nearly 6 percent. Baker Hughes shares were halted in New York Stock Exchange trading due to volatility. They later reopened and shot up 18 percent. Halliburton shares rose as much as 3.5 percent before trimming gains at the close. The last major deal in the energy industry, announced in August and worth some $70 billion, was pipeline giant Kinder Morgan Inc’s move to fold its various units into a single entity.

223,HAL,Baker Hughes says in preliminary merger talks with rival Halliburton,"HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes Inc said on Thursday it is in preliminary merger talks with its larger rival Halliburton Co, though any potential deal would likely face antitrust concerns. Two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Halliburton was looking to buy Baker Hughes, in what would be the second-largest energy deal of this year. Oil prices have slid by a third since June, eroding demand for drilling services and pummeling stock prices across the energy sector.

225,HAL,"Oil price drop, merger talks feed energy sector deal speculation","NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Talks that could lead to oilfield services provider Halliburton Co buying rival Baker Hughes Inc may herald increased deal-making in the energy business as companies bet on a protracted drop in oil prices, industry bankers said. Competing service companies including National Oilwell Varco Inc and Weatherford International may also be targets, bankers and lawyers said. In any deal, the incentives will be the same: consolidation would allow them to better weather the downturn and resist pressure from oil producers to slash prices. The Baker Hughes/Halliburton talks have stalled after the companies weren’t able to agree on issues including price, people familiar with the matter said Friday. As oil prices fall, oil field service companies get squeezed, one industry lawyer said. That’s because when prices fall far enough, it’s no longer economical to get oil out of the ground. If it’s too expensive to drill, there’s no need to pay an oilfield service company. “The services guys are the last marginal dollar,” the lawyer said. While services companies are likely to feel the effect of lower oil prices sooner, overleveraged exploration and production companies may also be pushed to do deals over the medium term, bankers said. Such companies could include Apache Corp, Hess Corp, Marathon Oil Corp or Devon Energy Corp, bankers said. Those four exploration companies along with the oil services companies including Baker Hughes, all have market values that range between about $20 billion and $31 billion. In the end, price expectations will decide whether upstream exploration and production companies turn into sellers. If sellers’ management believe the oil price will rebound fairly soon, sellers would wait until then, hurting chances for large deals. Brent crude traded at $79.60 a barrel on Friday, down from $115.06 on June 19. Until prices stabilize, exploration and production company deals will likely remain asset-level deals in distressed situations such as Samson Resources’ sale of its Bakken assets. “Certainly there will be instances where you will find more compromised balance sheet operators possibly being more inclined to sell their entire position,” said Ted Harper, a fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors LLC in Houston. Not all will be targets, he said. Some exploration and production companies will seek to buy at a discount additional potential reserves near where they are already drilling “to enhance returns from existing production,” he said. Because exploration and production companies will slow or stop drilling if they are not making money, there is enormous pricing pressure on oil field services providers as oil prices fall. Indeed, the tumbling price may have pushed the companies into a dialog, especially if Halliburton’s management believes that oil prices could remain low for some time. While Halliburton “has first mover advantage” in its bid to acquire Baker Hughes, “it’s common knowledge that Schlumberger made a run at Baker Hughes years ago to plug a major hole in (well) completions. That hole remains unfilled,” Bill Herbert, oilfield analyst at energy-focused investment bank Simmons & Co told clients on Friday. “Further, GE is lurking in the shadows as well, manufacturing cultures are comparable,” said Herbert. General Electric Co. has a large oil and gas business. While another bidder for Baker Hughes may not emerge, oilfield services companies and private equity firms will be looking to buy up any Baker Hughes business units shed to meet antitrust requirements if the Halliburton deal goes through, bankers said. “There is going to be reasonably competitive bidding on the part of the General Electrics, the National Oilwell Varcos and some of the midcap players,” said Frost’s Harper.

226,HAL,Halliburton mulls hostile Baker Hughes bid as talks end - sources,"Nov 14 (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Halliburton Co  is mulling a hostile bid for smaller peer Baker Hughes Inc after the latter pulled out of talks on Friday, two people familiar with the discussions said. The companies have so far failed to agree on a price and other key issues such as how to address antitrust concerns, the people said. However, Baker Hughes could still return to the negotiating table, one of the people added. The latest development, first reported by Bloomberg News after the stock market closed, would start another chapter in a strained takeover courtship to create the second largest drilling, logistics and well services provider. Halliburton first approached Baker Hughes more than a month ago and considered making an unsolicited bid because Baker Hughes was reluctant to engage, a third person familiar with the matter said last week. All the sources asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Halliburton shares edged down 0.3 percent after ending 1.3 percent higher at $55.08. Baker Hughes fell 2.5 percent from its closing price of $59.89, also on the New York Stock Exchange. Halliburton has considered proposing a slate of directors to Baker Hughes’ board, one of the first two sources said. The deadline for such nominations expires on Friday.

228,HAL,Halliburton to buy Baker Hughes for about $35 billion,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co said on Monday it will buy Baker Hughes Inc for about $35 billion in cash and stock, creating an oilfield services behemoth to take on market leader Schlumberger NV as customers curb spending on falling oil prices. Halliburton expressed confidence that the tie up of the No. 2 and No. 3 players in the services industry would clear regulatory hurdles, saying it was prepared to shed assets to mollify antitrust concerns that could arise in Asia, Europe and the Americas. The deal, the second biggest in the U.S. energy sector this year, could create a company with more revenue than  Schlumberger. (link.reuters.com/kav43w) With oil prices down by a third since June, demand for drilling services has slipped and stock prices across the energy sector have suffered. That has stoked chatter among executives and bankers about acquisition opportunities companies could take advantage of to weather the downturn. Halliburton Chief Executive Dave Lesar said the combined entity would be more resilient and able to offer a wider suite of products globally. “Stronger in any market condition is better,” he told Reuters. “We are in a cyclical business.” Halliburton said it was ready to divest businesses that generate revenue of $7.5 billion to satisfy regulators and would pay Baker Hughes $3.5 billion if the deal was not cleared. “At the end of the day, we wouldn’t have done this deal if we didn’t believe it was achievable from a regulatory standpoint,” Lesar said on a conference call. Baker Hughes shares were trading well below the offer, suggesting that investors were not so sure of regulatory approvals. But Kurt Hallead, oilfield services analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the risk of the deal failing was low. “I think the assessment on divestitures matches up pretty closely with the work we’ve done. I don’t anticipate there being any roadblocks,” he said. The transaction would unite the two companies based in Houston and create an entity dominant in U.S. onshore services such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.  While there are at least seven major services where there is an overlap between the two companies, the deal would fill gaps in two product lines in Halliburton’s portfolio – product chemicals and pumps that boost output from wells. Baker Hughes shares rose nearly 11 percent to $66.44 each  on Monday, well short of Halliburton’s offer of $80.69, based on Friday’s close. After a steep run up last week, Halliburton shares were down 8 percent at $50.60. Schlumberger was up 0.6 percent at $95.85. Talks between the two companies started over a month ago and came to a head on Friday when Halliburton threatened to replace Baker Hughes’s board after its initial offer was rejected. Baker Hughes shareholders will get 1.12 Halliburton shares plus $19 in cash for every share held, and own 36 percent of the combined company. Baker Hughes will get three seats on the combined company’s 15-member board. The combined company’s 2013 revenue was $51.8 billion on a pro-forma basis, more than Schlumberger’s $45.3 billion. But Schlumberger’s market capitalization of $122.6 billion is twice as large as the united company.

229,HAL,Halliburton faces tough sell in taking Baker Hughes deal to regulators,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Halliburton Co will have a tough time convincing U.S. regulators to approve its $35 billion deal to buy smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc but could prevail with the right divestitures, antitrust experts said Monday. The deal, if approved, would create an oil services behemoth that would overtake current No. 1 Schlumberger NV. Halliburton and Baker Hughes, which have already reached out to the U.S. Department of Justice, will argue that the government should analyze the companies by business segment and identify overlaps, according to a person familiar with the deal. If the merged company was found to have too much power in one area, assets could be sold to competitors to ensure no monopolies are created. Halliburton has said it was ready to divest businesses that generate revenue of $7.5 billion. It also agreed to pay Baker Hughes $3.5 billion if the deal did not clear. But the Justice Department could instead consider that customers that want to contract a range of oil services to a single company would only have two main choices, Schlumberger and the new merged company, if the deal were to go forward. This option is increasingly attractive to oil companies after the 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico because they want to be able to hold one company responsible in an accident, said two antitrust experts who know the industry. “Many countries, national oil companies and majors want one throat to choke (if there is a spill), especially after the Gulf,” said one of the experts. Still, the Justice Department could conclude that the oil companies who do business with Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes are big and sophisticated enough that they don’t need government protection, said Andre Barlow, a veteran of the Justice Department now with Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC. “In the past, the DOJ has considered buyer power and the sophistication of the buyers with regards to this particular industry,” said Barlow, who expected the deal to be approved with significant divestitures.

236,HAL,US STOCKS-Energy shares weigh on Wall St but merger activity supports,"* Baker Hughes rallies, Halliburton tumbles after deal * DreamWorks shares slide as Hasbro talks stall * Indexes down: Dow 0.1 pct; S&P; 500 0.2 pct; Nasdaq 0.5 pct   (Updates to midday, changes comment) By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Nov 17 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Monday, as energy shares dropped alongside crude futures after Japan slipped into recession, while merger and acquisition activity and hopes for more stimulus capped declines and kept indexes near record highs. The M&A; news partly offset the declines as Allergan agreed to be bought by Actavis while Halliburton said it would buy Baker Hughes. Allergan and Baker Hughes were the top point gainers on the S&P; 500. Japan’s economy unexpectedly slipped into recession in the third quarter, setting the stage for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to delay an unpopular sales tax hike and call a snap election two years before he has to go to the polls. The Japanese data hurt crude futures prices, with Brent  off 1.1 percent at $78.55 per barrel. Brent futures prices have fallen in the last eight weeks and are down more than 30 percent from June. The energy sector fell 0.8 percent, the largest weight on the S&P; 500. “Concern about deceleration of economic growth particularly in Asia” weighed on markets, said Chad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey. He said the offset to this worry was monetary policy in Europe and what it will mean for markets in the near term. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said stimulus is gaining traction and the ECB is ready to do more to accelerate the recovery. At 11:54 a.m. (1654 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average  fell 9.08 points, or 0.05 percent, to 17,625.66, the S&P; 500 lost 3.01 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,036.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 23.17 points, or 0.49 percent, to 4,665.37. The largest percentage gainer on the S&P; 500 was Baker Hughes, up 10.6 percent on news Halliburton  would acquire it in a cash and stock transaction of about $34.6 billion. Halliburton shares fell 9.3 percent. Denbury Resources, down 11.2 percent, was the largest S&P; 500 decliner. It said it would cut its capital spending for next year in half. Allergan added 6 percent to $210.46 as the Actavis buyout values the company at $66 billion. Actavis shares rose 2.3 percent to $249.30. Negotiations between Hasbro and DreamWorks Animation  have been hampered by issues regarding the structure of the combined company, according to a person familiar with the matter.

237,HAL,Halliburton to buy Baker Hughes for about $35 billion,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co said on Monday it will buy Baker Hughes Inc for about $35 billion in cash and stock, creating an oilfield services behemoth to take on market leader Schlumberger NV as customers curb spending on falling oil prices. Halliburton expressed confidence that the tie up of the No. 2 and No. 3 players in the services industry would clear regulatory hurdles, saying it was prepared to shed assets to mollify antitrust concerns that could arise in Asia, Europe and the Americas. The deal, the second biggest in the U.S. energy sector this year, could create a company with more revenue than  Schlumberger. (link.reuters.com/kav43w) With oil prices down by a third since June, demand for drilling services has slipped and stock prices across the energy sector have suffered. That has stoked chatter among executives and bankers about acquisition opportunities companies could take advantage of to weather the downturn.  Halliburton Chief Executive Dave Lesar said the combined entity would be more resilient and able to offer a wider suite of products globally. “Stronger in any market condition is better,” he told Reuters. “We are in a cyclical business.” Halliburton said it was ready to divest businesses that generate revenue of $7.5 billion to satisfy regulators and would pay Baker Hughes $3.5 billion if the deal was not cleared.  “At the end of the day, we wouldn’t have done this deal if we didn’t believe it was achievable from a regulatory standpoint,” Lesar said on a conference call. Baker Hughes shares were trading well below the offer, suggesting that investors were not so sure of regulatory approvals. But Kurt Hallead, oilfield services analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the risk of the deal failing was low. “I think the assessment on divestitures matches up pretty closely with the work we’ve done. I don’t anticipate there being any roadblocks,” he said. The transaction would unite the two companies based in Houston and create an entity dominant in U.S. onshore services such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling.  While there are at least seven major services where there is an overlap between the two companies, the deal would fill gaps in two product lines in Halliburton’s portfolio – product chemicals and pumps that boost output from wells. Baker Hughes shares rose nearly 11 percent to $66.44 each  on Monday, well short of Halliburton’s offer of $80.69, based on Friday’s close. After a steep run up last week, Halliburton shares were down 8 percent at $50.60. Schlumberger was up 0.6 percent at $95.85. Talks between the two companies started over a month ago and came to a head on Friday when Halliburton threatened to replace Baker Hughes’s board after its initial offer was rejected.  Baker Hughes shareholders will get 1.12 Halliburton shares plus $19 in cash for every share held, and own 36 percent of the combined company. Baker Hughes will get three seats on the combined company’s 15-member board. The combined company’s 2013 revenue was $51.8 billion on a pro-forma basis, more than Schlumberger’s $45.3 billion. But Schlumberger’s market capitalization of $122.6 billion is twice as large as the united company.

238,HAL,"Exclusive: With Baker Hughes, Halliburton cements leading North Dakota role","WILLISTON N.D. (Reuters) - Halliburton Co’s $35 billion takeover of Baker Hughes Inc will create an oilfield services powerhouse in North Dakota with more than half the cementing market and a leading position in fracking, according to data seen by Reuters.  The deal, announced on Monday, will help Halliburton better compete with global leader Schlumberger NV, as well as smaller peers Calfrac Well Services Ltd, Trican Well Service Ltd and other oilfield services companies in North Dakota, the second-largest oil producer in the United States.   The North Dakota market share projections for the combined company will be of keen interest to competitors and regulators.   The deal faces stiff antitrust hurdles and likely will receive close scrutiny from regulators in the United States and European Union. Halliburton has said it would be willing to shed units that generate revenue of $7.5 billion to ensure the deal closes. Even though oil production in the state’s Bakken shale formation has grown exponentially in the past five years, more than 35,000 new wells are expected to come online in the state by 2030, highlighting the ongoing need for the services these companies provide. “We will rule unconventionals now,” one Halliburton manager in North Dakota told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity.     In the Williston Basin, the oil-rich geologic formation holding much of North Dakota’s Bakken and Three Forks shales, the combined company will control 53 percent of the market to line a new well with cement to prevent leaks, according to the data. The step is required by regulators and a key process to safeguard drinking water supplies. The combined company will also control roughly 36 percent of the Williston Basin market for hydraulic fracturing - the process commonly known as ‘fracking’ where water and sand are blasted into a well at high pressure to extract oil. And roughly 35 percent of the market for directional drilling, the process to drill wells horizontally, will be held by the combined company, according to the data. The Williston Basin market prowess in cementing and directional drilling would eclipse the united company’s global share of those markets. Fracking market share in the basin would nearly match the new Halliburton, globally.   Halliburton is very interested in Baker Hughes’ artificial lift division, which makes products that help old wells boost their productivity, as well as its production chemicals unit, according to footnotes accompanying the data. In a statement to Reuters, Halliburton said it is too early to discuss the status of the combined company. “It is important to remember that until the close of the transaction, Halliburton and Baker Hughes remain separate companies,” Halliburton spokeswoman Emily Mir said.  It was not immediately clear what Schlumberger’s market share is for various products and services in North Dakota, but the Halliburton-Baker Hughes tie-up gives the combined company clear dominance in most oilfield services performed in the state. Schlumberger did not respond to a request for comment.  The deal could lead to higher prices for some oil producers. Baker Hughes historically has priced its services below Halliburton, and the deal will allow Halliburton to make pricing more uniform. Continental Resources Inc, for instance, uses a plethora of oilfield service companies for various well completion processes, often choosing the lowest bidder. The deal also gives Halliburton access to Baker Hughes’ extensive North Dakota real estate holdings, including a training center it built earlier this year. Halliburton currently trains employees at centers in Oklahoma and Colorado.

241,HAL,UPDATE 1-Oilfield 'man camp' operator Civeo cuts jobs amid oil slump,"(Adds details on spin off concerns, REIT plans, rivals, customers, tax move) By Ernest Scheyder WILLISTON, N.D., Dec 29 (Reuters) - Civeo Corp, which provides temporary housing for oilfield workers and miners, slashed its workforce on Monday and said revenue could fall by a third as slumping crude prices force oil producers to cut costs The warning adds jitters to the already-wary global oil market and highlights weakness in Australia’s coal industry, one of Civeo’s biggest markets which has been battered by low global demand for steel. Civeo suspended its quarterly dividend and said it has reduced its workforce in the United States, its smallest market, by 45 percent, and in Canada, its second-biggest market, by 30 percent. Shares of the Houston-based company which was spun off from Oil States International Inc in May, fell 30 percent in extended trading. Civeo had long struggled before it became independent, even losing money in 2013 in the United States, its most-promising market. A 50 percent decline in crude prices since June has put new pressure on it as demand for temporary housing softens. Some oilfield workers also prefer to live in apartments, which many growing towns have urged developers to build. Williams County, North Dakota, has a moratorium on new temporary housing known as “man camps” which are made up of units that look like a cross between shipping containers and mobile homes. Civeo forecasts revenue of $160 million to $175 million for the first quarter ending March. Analysts on average expect $228 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Civeo expects, at most, 40 percent of its Australian and Canadian rooms to be rented by the time the new year starts. At this time last year, 75 percent of Canadian rooms and 55 percent of Australian rooms were rented. The company gained around 25 percent of overall 2013 revenues from the Australian coal mining industry. Before the spin off, some investors openly questioned the wisdom of floating the company as a “pure-play,” saying it would be undercapitalized and lack the protection of an established parent during a cyclical downturn. Those warnings now seem prescient. Civeo’s plans to try and abrogate the commodity-price cycle by setting up a tax-advantaged Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) have also unraveled. The REIT setback prompted the company to say in September it would try to relocate to Canada to enjoy lower taxes, though U.S. regulators have tried to stymie such moves. Civeo, one of the largest publicly-traded players in the “man camp” accommodations business dominated mainly by privately-held companies, has more than 20,000 dormitory-style rooms across remote parts of Canada, Australia and the United States for workers at Imperial Oil Ltd, Vale  and others. One of its main rivals, Target Logistics, a subsidiary of Baltimore-based Algeco Scotsman, operates dozens of locations throughout North Dakota and has long-term contracts with Halliburton Co and others. (Video tour of North Dakota man camp: here ) The man camps are often constructed with dozens of trailers joined together by temporary hallways, with a common cafeteria and entertainment facilities.

242,HAL,Oilfield housing firm's stumble may herald more oil industry pain,"WILLISTON, N.D., Dec 31 (Reuters) - A nasty profit warning and deep job cuts. A gutted capital budget, a suspended dividend and shares tumbling by more than half on a single day. The retrenchment at Civeo Corp, which provides temporary housing for oilfield workers and miners, is the most-severe symptom of pain inflicted on the oil service industry by the slide in crude prices, and may presage similar steps by peers. It also exposes the transient nature of the “man camp” business of dormitory-style temporary housing the company helped pioneer. Drilling, a barometer of oilfield activity, has been slowing for weeks as producers slashed spending plans by 20 to 40 percent. Baker Hughes reported last week the U.S. land rig count fell by 35 to 1,770 and hundreds more rigs will be idled, hitting scores of services companies from ones renting trailers to those repairing pumps. The pain will spread unevenly. Companies with weaker finances or older equipment are set to be hit sooner and harder by the more-than 50 percent drop in crude prices since June. Analysts and investors say Civeo’s problem is that it has spread itself geographically too thin, with not enough cash to quickly respond to customers’ needs. The company, spun off in May from equipment maker Oil States International Inc, has seen demand drop in Canada’s oil sands regions and in Australia, where it houses coal miners, leaving it with little cash to expand in North Dakota’s oil counties, where it has only two facilities. Civeo shares are down over 80 percent this year after tumbling 53 percent on Tuesday, compared with Oil States’s 15 percent slide and a roughly 13 percent gain in the S&P; 500  index. Several firms serving Australia’s mining sector, Civeo’s key market, have also been hit hard by the retreat in commodity and energy prices. For example, Alliance Aviation Services  Ltd  <AQZ.AX, which flies miners to and from remote camp sites, this month cut its earnings forecast, dropped an interim dividend and reduced its aircraft fleet. Businesses providing services to the camps are smarting too. “I took a massive plunge right along with the drop in coal prices,” said Fiona Berridge, who runs Scrubz Pro Clean, a linen and cleaning service for miners in the coal town of Moranbah in Australia’s Bowen Basin. “I used to have 35 people working here, now I have eight.” Stronger companies have proven more resilient, at least for now. Target Logistics, the top temporary housing operator in North Dakota and one of the largest in the world, says it is finishing 2014 with “high utilization” at its facilities. The privately-held company declined to be more specific, but said it did not expect a decline in 2015 occupancy. Analysts say the company has been able to land long-term contracts with companies like Halliburton Co and EOG Resources Inc, by offering them the size and scale Civeo cannot match. In North Dakota alone, Target Logistics has 10 camps and touts its ability to quickly add housing wherever needed. To save cash, oil producers have already started to ask drilling and well completion services firms to cut their prices by 10 to 30 percent, said PacWest, an energy consultancy in Houston. That is hurting the most so-called pressure pumpers, often small privately-held firms, that run fleets of diesel engines used to generate power for hydraulic fracturing jobs. “We expect cash flow and solvency challenges and more consolidation in the industry,” PacWest said earlier this month. Kirby Corp, which moves crude and other fuels by barge, issued a profit warning in December as its business overhauling diesel engines in onshore fields was hit harder by the oil slide than earlier anticipated. The largest services companies, Halliburton and Schlumberger , have said they will reduce headcount, while BP Plc  announced a $1 billion restructuring. In the offshore drilling market, Hercules Offshore  has cut 15 percent of its staff, while Transocean Ltd  has said it will scrap seven older offshore rigs as softer demand means only the newest rigs can win contracts.

245,HAL,"Halliburton, Baker Hughes to lay off thousands as oil slumps","(Reuters) - Oilfield service providers Baker Hughes Inc and Halliburton Co plan to cut thousands of jobs as drilling activity slows further due to a steep fall in crude oil prices. Global oil prices have tumbled almost 60 percent since June, hitting five-year lows as growing production and tepid global demand has caused a supply glut and prompted oil producers to scale back spending. “We expect our headcount adjustments to be in line with our primary competitors,” Halliburton’s Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Miller said on a post-earnings call on Tuesday, without giving a specific number. The company, which employees more than 80,000 people, said it cut 1,000 jobs in its operations in the eastern hemisphere in the fourth quarter. Baker Hughes, which is being acquired by Halliburton in a near-$35 billion deal, said earlier in the day it would lay off 7,000 employees. Shares of Halliburton and Baker Hughes were down about 2 percent in morning trading, reversing earlier gains after the companies posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter results due to resilient demand. The job cuts, which come days after industry leader Schlumberger NV said it would cut 9,000 jobs, underscore the abrupt slowdown in drilling activity seen in the past two months. The U.S. land rig count has fallen by 250 rigs, or about 15 percent, over the last 60 days, Halliburton Chief Executive Dave Lesar said on the call. Halliburton and Baker Hughes derive about half of their revenue from North America, a region they expect to fare worse than the rest of the world in the oil slump. Baker Hughes said most of the workforce reduction would take place in the first quarter, when it expects to book a one-time severance charge of $160 million to $185 million.

246,HAL,"UPDATE 4-Halliburton, Baker Hughes to lay off thousands as oil slumps","* Baker Hughes to lay off 7,000 employees * Halliburton says job cuts to be in line with primary competitors * Baker Hughes says falling rig count to affect 2015 results * Baker Hughes fourth-quarter adjusted profit $1.44 vs est $1.07 * Halliburton adjusted profit from cont ops $1.19 vs est $1.10   (Adds comments from Halliburton’s conference call) By Swetha Gopinath and Shubhankar Chakravorty Jan 20 (Reuters) - Oilfield service providers Baker Hughes Inc and Halliburton Co plan to cut thousands of jobs as drilling activity slows further due to a steep fall in crude oil prices. Global oil prices  have tumbled almost 60 percent since June, hitting five-year lows as growing production and tepid global demand has caused a supply glut and prompted oil producers to scale back spending. “We expect our headcount adjustments to be in line with our primary competitors,” Halliburton’s Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Miller said on a post-earnings call on Tuesday, without giving a specific number. The company, which employees more than 80,000 people, said it cut 1,000 jobs in its operations in the eastern hemisphere in the fourth quarter. Baker Hughes, which is being acquired by Halliburton in a near-$35 billion deal, said earlier in the day it would lay off 7,000 employees. Shares of Halliburton and Baker Hughes were down about 2 percent in morning trading, reversing earlier gains after the companies posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter results due to resilient demand. The job cuts, which come days after industry leader Schlumberger NV said it would cut 9,000 jobs, underscore the abrupt slowdown in drilling activity seen in the past two months. The U.S. land rig count has fallen by 250 rigs, or about 15 percent, over the last 60 days, Halliburton Chief Executive Dave Lesar said on the call. Halliburton and Baker Hughes derive about half of their revenue from North America, a region they expect to fare worse than the rest of the world in the oil slump. Baker Hughes said most of the workforce reduction would take place in the first quarter, when it expects to book a one-time severance charge of $160 million to $185 million. The company, which had 61,100 employees as of Sept. 30, said it was also considering closing facilities.

The lower forecasts implied less demand for fuel through 2016, contributing to crude oil prices taking another leg lower, which in turn fueled another day of weakness in the energy space despite some bullish results from major names. The IMF projected growth of 3.5 percent this year and 3.7 percent next year; both forecasts are down by 0.3 percentage points. The IMF advised advanced economies to maintain accommodative monetary policies to avoid increases in real interest rates as cheaper oil increases the risk of deflation. “This absolutely raises the odds that we’ll see more central bank action. The upside to seeing less international growth is that it is now very unlikely the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates mid-year,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. The European Central Bank is expected to announce on Thursday a program of bond buying designed to boost the region’s flagging economy. “If we don’t see something out of the ECB, that will really increase volatility,” Nolte said.

254,HAL,Many oil firms plan no North Dakota layoffs despite cheap oil,"WILLISTON, N.D. (Reuters) - Halliburton, Statoil ASA, Hess Corp and other North Dakota energy companies have decided, for now, not to lay off staff in the No. 2 U.S. oil producing state, hoping to be prepared for any prolonged rebound in crude prices. Many oil producers and their contractors are trying to strike a balance between cutting costs and maintaining workforce reserves after a more-than 50 percent drop in oil prices since last June.  The drop has made some oil patch investors anxious that North Dakota could experience a third oil bust after slumps in the 1950s and 1980s. Local business leaders, though, say they’re confident the state’s economy can abide the slowdown.  Indeed, oil prices are nothing if not volatile, up about 19 percent in the past four trading days after plunging for months. Whiting Petroleum Corp, the largest North Dakota oil producer, has no plans to lay off any of its 507 employees in the state, spokesman Eric Hagen said.  Oilfield service provider Halliburton has told its roughly 1,500 North Dakota employees that job cuts are not coming, for now. The update came in a letter to staff from Brent Eslinger, senior district manager for Halliburton in Williston, considered capital of North Dakota’s oil patch. Halliburton spokeswoman Susie McMichael added that the company “will continue to monitor the business environment” and cut costs as needed. Hess Corp, the state’s third-largest oil producer and one that uses Halliburton to hydraulically fracture wells, has no plans to cut North Dakota staff. “We’re all about lean efficiencies, but there are no plans for layoffs,” Hess spokesman John Roper said. Other large North Dakota producers, including Oasis Petroleum Inc and Statoil, have said they have no plans to reduce their workforce. EOG Resources Inc hasn’t “announced any layoffs,” spokeswoman K Leonard said. To be sure, all energy-related companies in North Dakota’s oil patch are hunkering down. Many of the state’s oil producers, including Hess and Oasis, have cut 2015 capital budgets. Whiting and EOG release spending plans later this month. While there are nearly 800 wells needing to be fracked in North Dakota, oil producers can wait up to a year to do so. Hess, for instance, plans to bring fewer wells online in 2015. Halliburton’s announcement last month that it will lay off 1,000 in the eastern hemisphere - as well as similar plans by peers Schlumberger NV and Baker Hughes Inc, which Halliburton is buying for roughly $35 billion - sparked concern that the companies would cull large portions of their North Dakota staffs, steps that would have a negative economic ripple effect. Such fears, for now, appear unwarranted.     Continental Resources Inc, North Dakota’s second-largest oil producer, did not return a call seeking comment on staffing levels.

258,HAL,Halliburton to cut thousands of jobs as oil slumps,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. oil services company Halliburton (HAL.N) said on Tuesday it expects to cut potentially more than 6,000 jobs across the globe because of a “challenging market environment” resulting from low oil prices.  Halliburton, the latest in a growing list of major oil industry companies laying off workers because of a worldwide  glut of crude, said it expects to let go 6.5 percent to 8 percent of its 80,000-strong workforce, amounting to between 5,200 and 6,400 jobs. The number includes the 1,000 jobs that had been cut in the eastern hemisphere in the fourth quarter of 2014, a company spokeswoman said. Halliburton said the impact of the layoffs would be across all company operations, but it did not offer specifics.  Oil prices have dropped about half to $50 a barrel since June because of the global glut of oil, forcing many companies to reduce spending. The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States has plummeted in recent weeks as drillers halt projects to save cash. Record high stocks of oil in the United States have continued to pressure prices. Layoffs by companies struggling with the slowdown have reached into the tens of thousands.  Baker Hughes, a U.S. oil services provider that is being acquired by Halliburton in a deal worth nearly $35 billion, said in January that it would lay off 7,000 employees. Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services company,  said last month that it would cut 9,000 jobs, or about 7 percent of its workforce.

Euro zone ministers agreed that technical talks between finance experts from Athens and its international creditors would start on Wednesday, with the aim of unlocking further funding. However, the ministers warned Greece that it had “no time to lose.” Greece’s debt issues have been on the back burner of late for U.S. investors, who continue to watch the region with caution. While the United States has little direct exposure to the country, there are concerns that extended uncertainty could spread throughout the euro zone. “There’s a lot of rhetoric out there, some of which feels like name-calling, all of which makes the situation read as worse than it used to be,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group in New York. In China, the pace of inflation unexpectedly picked up in February while producer prices continued to slide, underscoring the intense pressure on profit margins at Chinese companies and adding urgency to policymakers’ efforts to find new ways to support growth. The day’s losses were broad, with all 10 primary S&P; 500 sectors lower. Despite that, major indexes were less than 3 percent away from record levels, and the S&P; 500 appeared to find support at its 50-day moving average of 2,061.61. “Valuations are reasonable now. They’re not low anymore,” Colas said. “We’re at a level where we’ll still make new highs, but there will be a lot more volatility on the path higher.” Qualcomm Inc rose 1.5 percent to $73.80 a day after the chipmaker said it would buy back up to $15 billion of shares and raise its quarterly dividend.

265,HAL,Factbox: U.S. energy companies slash jobs as oil prices weaken,"(Reuters) - Oilfield giants Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and many others in the oil and gas industry have announced plans to lay off thousands of people in the past few months as global oil prices have halved since June. In March, Brent prices LCoc1 fell to a near six-year low, hurt by a global supply glut and OPEC’s decision not to curtail production. This prompted oil producers to trim their budgets and lower the number of rigs planned for 2015, hurting their suppliers and service providers. Smaller oil services company Weatherford said last month it would eliminate the position of chief operating officer, while tiny oil and gas producer Resolute Energy Corp (REN.N) said it would slash its CEO’s base pay by 96 percent.   Oil major BP Plc (BP.L) said it would freeze its base pay across the company this year, while Basic Energy Services (BAS.N) said it has implemented salary cuts for all management and administrative employees and made changes to some benefit programs.   The job cuts announced so far would not be sufficient to maintain profitability, analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein wrote in a note on March 16. The offshore oil services industry in the United States and Europe has to cut 10-15 percent more jobs over 2015, they said.

Following its $35 billion merger agreement with Baker Hughes Inc in November, Halliburton earlier this month outlined some of the oilfield services assets it will seek to divest to alleviate regulators’ antitrust concerns.  Bank of America has been mandated to sell parts of Halliburton’s Sperry Drilling business, which provides offshore and onshore drilling and petrophysical engineering services globally, the people said this week. These assets include directional drilling, logging-while-drilling, and measuring-while-drilling, the people added. The Sperry units for sale generate about $3 billion of revenue annually, and could fetch about that amount in a sale, the people said.  Separately, Deutsche Bank is working to sell Halliburton’s drill bits business, including the roller cone bits and fixed cutter bits, the people said. These assets could be sold for between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, the people added.

270,HAL,Lower cost cuts at Halliburton may give Schlumberger near-term edge,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co’s decision to cut fewer jobs and keep its logistics network intact to capitalize on its pending merger with Baker Hughes Inc could give Schlumberger NV an edge at a time when cost cuts look like the best way forward. Halliburton is sticking to an “elevated cost structure” as it bets on its capacity to take on more work as a bigger company once the $35 billion deal closes, a move that could cost the company a 2-3 percent decline in near-time margins. But work itself is scarce, with oil producers doubling down for a long downturn in the North American shale industry, which has been crippled due to a slump in global oil prices. Schlumberger, the world’s No.1 oilfield services provider, recently wooed shareholders with 11,000 job cuts, in addition to the 9,000 announced earlier. In comparison, Halliburton has cut 9,000 jobs. “I think in the very near term, Schlumberger is going to make more money than Halliburton because it’s not carrying the extra cost,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Boyd. Moreover, higher costs will hinder Halliburton’s ability to take on Schlumberger in international markets, which have been more resilient to the drop in crude prices. “By leveraging both its technological and cost advantages, I think Schlumberger has the opportunity to take share in areas that are not a primary focus for Halliburton and Baker Hughes,” said Tigress Financial Partners analyst Philip Van Deusen. But both Boyd and Deusen said Halliburton stands to gain in the longer term because of the deal due to benefits from synergies. Halliburton has said it expects the Baker Hughes deal to result in annual costs savings of about $2 billion. “... in a typical downturn we would have reduced our operating cost structure more than we have done ...,” Halliburton Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Miller said on a post-earnings call on Monday. “While this decision burdens current margins, it is clearly the right thing to do in the long run.” Halliburton’s margins in the January-March quarter slid more than 11 percentage points from the October-December period, according to Barclays, while Schlumberger’s margins fell by 6.7 percentage points. “Schlumberger’s margins in North America will likely be higher than Halliburton’s during the downturn,” said Evercore ISI analyst James West.

272,HAL,Halliburton profit surges past expectations as cost cuts pay off,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co’s (HAL.N) quarterly profit beat analyst expectations by the biggest margin in at least eight quarters as cost cuts helped the oilfield services provider offset a steep fall in drilling in North America, its biggest market. The company’s shares rose as much as 4.4 percent to $48.93 on Monday. Revenue fell by 4 percent to $7.05 billion in the first quarter, but beat analysts’ average expectation of $6.96 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, helped by strength in the Middle East and Asia and Latin America. However, revenue and operating profit from all other regions fell. North America, which accounted for more than half the company’s first-quarter revenue, “experienced an unprecedented decline in drilling activity,” Chief Executive Dave Lesar said in a statement. The average U.S. rig count has fallen about 40 percent since June and was at 1,110 in March, according to a Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N survey. Halliburton also forecast a fall in current-quarter revenue from North America as a 45 percent fall in oil prices since June continues to force drillers to slash spending. The company also forecast a fall in revenue from Latin America, hurt mainly by the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar against the dollar. Halliburton, which has cut more than 9,000 jobs, or over 10 percent of its global headcount in last two quarters, said it would cut capital spending by $500 million, or about 15 percent, to $2.8 billion this year. Industry leader Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) reported a better-than-expected profit last week and said it was shedding about 15 percent of its workforce, or 20,000 jobs. Baker Hughes, which will report results on Tuesday, had forecast cutting 7,000 jobs to rein in costs. Halliburton agreed to buy Baker Hughes for $35 billion last November, a deal aimed at helping the companies weather the slump in oil and resist pressure from producers to slash prices. Halliburton said earlier this month that it would sell three businesses to help get regulatory clearance for the deal. The company is likely to make additional divestitures to ensure the deal goes through, Chief Integration Officer Mark McCollum said on Monday. Excluding $1.21 billion in charges related to asset writedowns and other items, Halliburton earned 49 cents per share, above the average analyst estimate of 37 cents. The company’s shares were up 3.5 percent at $48.53 in morning trading.

273,HAL,Halliburton sees pricing pressure in North America,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N) warned of pricing pressure in North America, its largest market, and challenges in international operations as drillers continue to slash spending due to an extended slump in oil prices. The oilfield services company, however, posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by higher revenue and operating income from Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. Halliburton executives spoke to analysts on a conference call on Monday. Here is a selection of comments from the conference call. “Because of the lack of available work driven by the rig count decline and the resulting overcapacity ... we are seeing substantial pricing pressure in all of our product lines and a significant amount of service capacity is looking for work.” “Service company behavior has fallen really into one of three buckets. First, those who are still running their businesses to make a profit and returns for their investors; second, those who have decided that covering fixed cost is no longer important and therefore will take work to keep equipment busy and crews intact while operating at a loss; and third, those who are basically working at a price which covers only their cash costs.” “We are still seeing activity fall off week-to-week although the pace of decline has slowed.” “We are not going to call the bottom, but historically it’s taken rig count three quarters to move from peak to trough.” “We still expect Middle East Asia to be the most stable region for the company in 2015 as recent project awards in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE and Kuwait are anticipated to move forward.” “Input cost reductions around items like sand and logistics began during the first quarter and we expect to realize more of these cost savings as we move through the remainder of the year.” “In a typical downturn, we would have reduced our operating cost structure more than we have done, but in anticipation of closing the Baker Hughes acquisition later this year we want to preserve our underlying service delivery platform.” “We are not cutting as deep as we might have done so otherwise. Consequently, we’re carrying an elevated cost structure. While this decision burdens current margins it is clearly the right thing to do in the long run.” “North America will continue to be the most adaptable market ... The US unconventional business is now the lowest cost, fastest to market incremental barrel of oil available in the world today.” “When the recovery does come, North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be best positioned to lead the way.” “It’s a tough market out there and we are not going to try to call a recovery. There are just not enough convincing data points out there at this time for me to make a conclusion.” “The operators, vendors and service companies who deal most effectively with the velocity of this downturn will be those who profit the most when it turns. We fully expect Halliburton to be one of those winners.” “There will likely be additional divestitures and we plan to provide updates at the appropriate time; however, launching the sale of the drill bits and drilling businesses is a good first step toward expediting this process.”  “The eventual sale of (drill bits and drilling businesses) is subject to obtaining final approval of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition by the competition authorities reviewing the transaction.” “We believe we remain on track to complete the (Baker Hughes) transaction late in the second half of 2015.” “We continue to target annual pretax cost synergies of nearly $2 billion.” ",4202015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-halliburton-comments-ceo/halliburton-sees-pricing-pressure-in-north-america-idUSKBN0NB1IL20150420

Revenue fell by 4 percent to $7.05 billion in the first quarter, but beat analysts’ average expectation of $6.96 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, helped by strength in the Middle East and Asia and Latin America. However, revenue and operating profit from all other regions fell. North America, which accounted for more than half the company’s first-quarter revenue, “experienced an unprecedented decline in drilling activity,” Chief Executive Dave Lesar said in a statement. The average U.S. rig count has fallen about 40 percent since June and was at 1,110 in March, according to a Baker Hughes Inc  survey. Halliburton also forecast a fall in current-quarter revenue from North America as a 45 percent fall in oil prices since June continues to force drillers to slash spending. The company also forecast a fall in revenue from Latin America, hurt mainly by the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar against the dollar. Halliburton, which has cut more than 9,000 jobs, or over 10 percent of its global headcount in last two quarters, said it would cut capital spending by $500 million, or about 15 percent, to $2.8 billion this year. Industry leader Schlumberger Ltd reported a better-than-expected profit last week and said it was shedding about 15 percent of its workforce, or 20,000 jobs. Baker Hughes, which will report results on Tuesday, had forecast cutting 7,000 jobs to rein in costs. Halliburton agreed to buy Baker Hughes for $35 billion last November, a deal aimed at helping the companies weather the slump in oil and resist pressure from producers to slash prices. Halliburton said earlier this month that it would sell three businesses to help get regulatory clearance for the deal. The company is likely to make additional divestitures to ensure the deal goes through, Chief Integration Officer Mark McCollum said on Monday. Excluding $1.21 billion in charges related to asset writedowns and other items, Halliburton earned 49 cents per share, above the average analyst estimate of 37 cents. The company’s shares were up 3.5 percent at $48.53 in morning trading.

275,HAL,UPDATE 1-QUOTEBOX-Halliburton sees pricing pressure in N. America,"(Adds quotes from executives) April 20 (Reuters) - Halliburton Co warned of pricing pressure in North America, its largest market, and challenges in international operations as drillers continue to slash spending due to an extended slump in oil prices. The oilfield services company, however, posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by higher revenue and operating income from Latin America, the Middle East and Asia. Halliburton executives spoke to analysts on a conference call on Monday. Here is a selection of comments from the conference call. “Because of the lack of available work driven by the rig count decline and the resulting overcapacity ... we are seeing substantial pricing pressure in all of our product lines and a significant amount of service capacity is looking for work.” “Service company behavior has fallen really into one of three buckets. First, those who are still running their businesses to make a profit and returns for their investors; second, those who have decided that covering fixed cost is no longer important and therefore will take work to keep equipment busy and crews intact while operating at a loss; and third, those who are basically working at a price which covers only their cash costs.” “We are still seeing activity fall off week-to-week although the pace of decline has slowed.” “We are not going to call the bottom, but historically it’s taken rig count three quarters to move from peak to trough.” “We still expect Middle East Asia to be the most stable region for the company in 2015 as recent project awards in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE and Kuwait are anticipated to move forward.” “Input cost reductions around items like sand and logistics began during the first quarter and we expect to realize more of these cost savings as we move through the remainder of the year.” “In a typical downturn, we would have reduced our operating cost structure more than we have done, but in anticipation of closing the Baker Hughes acquisition later this year we want to preserve our underlying service delivery platform.” “We are not cutting as deep as we might have done so otherwise. Consequently, we’re carrying an elevated cost structure. While this decision burdens current margins it is clearly the right thing to do in the long run.” “North America will continue to be the most adaptable market ... The US unconventional business is now the lowest cost, fastest to market incremental barrel of oil available in the world today.” “When the recovery does come, North America will respond the quickest and offer the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be best positioned to lead the way.” “It’s a tough market out there and we are not going to try to call a recovery. There are just not enough convincing data points out there at this time for me to make a conclusion.” “The operators, vendors and service companies who deal most effectively with the velocity of this downturn will be those who profit the most when it turns. We fully expect Halliburton to be one of those winners.” “There will likely be additional divestitures and we plan to provide updates at the appropriate time; however, launching the sale of the drill bits and drilling businesses is a good first step toward expediting this process.” “The eventual sale of (drill bits and drilling businesses) is subject to obtaining final approval of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition by the competition authorities reviewing the transaction.” “We believe we remain on track to complete the (Baker Hughes) transaction late in the second half of 2015.” “We continue to target annual pretax cost synergies of nearly $2 billion.”   (Reporting by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",4202015,http://www.reuters.com/article/halliburton-comments-ceo/update-1-quotebox-halliburton-sees-pricing-pressure-in-n-america-idUSL4N0XH4QD20150420

278,HAL,Baker Hughes expects falling rig count to weigh on second-quarter,"(Reuters) - Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N, which is being bought by Halliburton Co (HAL.N) for $35 billion, said it expects “unfavorable market conditions” to persist in the second quarter as drillers turn off more rigs, intensifying a glut in oilfield services. The comments echoed larger rival Halliburton’s warning on Monday of pricing pressure hurting oilfield services in North America and challenges in international operations. The rig count in North America, a region that accounts for 44 percent of Baker Hughes’ revenue, has halved to 1,000 so far this year. The dramatic fall follows a 45 percent drop in global oil prices LCOc1 CLc1 since June. Oil producers have responded by quickly scaling back spending, which in turn has weighed on demand for Baker Hughes’ services. In response, the company is cutting 10,500 jobs or 17 percent of its global workforce. Baker Hughes also said it had closed and consolidated about 140 facilities worldwide, besides idling and writing off excess assets and inventory. Halliburton said on Monday that it had laid off about 9,000 workers, or more than 10 percent of its global headcount, in the past two quarters, while industry leader Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) said last week that it was shedding about 15 percent of its workforce, or 20,000 jobs. Baker Hughes, which publishes a closely watched rig count, said it expected the rig count in North America to drop 30 percent in the second quarter on a sequential basis, and by as much as 15 percent across Europe and Africa. The company swung to a quarterly loss in the first quarter ended March 31 as it recorded a $772 million charge related to restructuring and other items. Net loss attributable to Baker Hughes was $589 million, or $1.35 per share, compared with a profit of $328 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell nearly 20 percent to $4.59 billion. Up to Monday’s close, Houston-based Baker Hughes’ shares had fallen 6.4 percent since June last year.

292,HAL,"UPDATE 3-BP settles oil spill-related claims with Halliburton, Transocean","(Adds statement from plaintiffs’ attorneys) May 20 (Reuters) - BP Plc has settled with oilfield services provider Halliburton Co and contract driller Transocean Ltd cross claims related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the worst offshore disaster in U.S. history. BP still faces a potential fine of up to $13.7 billion under the U.S. Clean Water Act. Transocean, which owned the Deepwater Horizon rig, had settled its Clean Water Act liability for $1 billion. The U.S. government never sued Halliburton under the Act, one person familiar with the case said. “We have now settled all matters relating to the accident with both our partners in the well and our contractors,” BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said in an email. Transocean said BP would pay the company $125 million in compensation for legal fees it incurred, adding the companies will mutually release all claims against each other. The company added BP will also discontinue its attempts to recover as an “additional insured” under Transocean’s liability policies that will accelerate the company’s recovery of about $538 million in insurance claims. Transocean also said it would pay about $212 million to a fund set up to pay out claims to people and businesses harmed by the spill, subject to the approval by U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. “We applaud Transocean for adding to the settlement funds established in the Halliburton settlement to help compensate people and businesses for their losses,” said co-lead plaintiffs’ attorneys, Stephen Herman and James Roy. Transocean said it intends to make the payments using cash on hand. In September, a U.S. judge ruled that BP was mostly at fault and that Transocean and Halliburton were not as much to blame. Halliburton, which did the cementing work for BP’s well, had earlier blamed BP’s decision to use only six centralizers for the blowout that spilled millions of barrels of oil for 87 days. Halliburton said in September that it reached a $1.1 billion settlement for a majority of claims related to its role in the oil spill. London-based BP has already taken $43.8 billion in pretax charges for clean-up and other costs.

293,HAL,UPDATE 2-Nigerian oil union halts Halliburton operation over job cuts,"(Adds Halliburton reaction, background) LAGOS, May 26 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s main oil union has shut down the local operations of U.S. oilfield services provider Halliburton Co in protest against job cuts, the trade body said on Tuesday. Tokunbo Korodo, Lagos chairman for the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), told Reuters the group halted operations on Monday saying it was opposed to Halliburton’s decision to sack 46 local staff members. The union accused Halliburton of not following due process. Halliburton’s staff cuts in Nigeria are part of a company-wide jobs cull announced earlier this year to counter a sharp downturn in global oil prices since last summer that has shrunk profits. In April, the company, which provides drilling services to Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Chevron Corp in Africa’s top oil producer, said it had cut 9,000 jobs, or about 10 percent of the global workforce, and that more were planned. “Halliburton is in conversations with the union to resolve the pending issues,” a company spokeswoman said via email. “We will continue to monitor the business environment and will make additional adjustments...as needed,” she said. She declined to comment on how many jobs had been cut or what operations were impacted. The shutdown was confirmed by another oil industry trade union - Petroleum and Natural Gas Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) - which said the U.S. company sacked trade union executives in an attempt to weaken the bodies representing workers’ rights, Emmanuel Ojugbana spokesman for PENGASSAN said.

297,HAL,BP reaches $18.7 billion settlement over deadly 2010 spill,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - BP Plc will pay up to $18.7 billion in penalties to the U.S. government and five states to resolve nearly all claims from its deadly Gulf of Mexico oil spill five years ago in the largest corporate settlement in U.S. history. The agreement adds to the $43.8 billion that BP had previously set aside for criminal and civil penalties and cleanup costs. The company said its total pre-tax charge for the spill now stands at $53.8 billion. (link.reuters.com/duz94w) BP shares jumped more than 5 percent in New York trading as investors said the British company, often mentioned as a potential acquisition target, could now turn the page on one of the darkest chapters in its century-long history. Under the agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the states, BP will pay at least $12.8 billion for Clean Water Act fines and natural resource damages, plus $4.9 billion to states. The payouts will be staggered over as many as 18 years. The preliminary settlement, subject to all sorts of variables, avoids a substantial amount of further litigation. The rig explosion on April 20, 2010, the worst offshore oil disaster in U.S. history, killed 11 workers and spewed millions of barrels of oil onto the shorelines of several states for nearly three months. The agreement, which still needs to be approved by courts, covers Clean Water Act fines and natural resources damages, along with claims by Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas as well as 400 local government entities. “This is a realistic outcome which provides clarity and certainty for all parties,” BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement. “For BP, this agreement will resolve the largest liabilities remaining from the tragic accident.”  The size of the settlement was slightly more than the $17.6 billion that investors had initially feared BP would be fined for gross negligence under the Clean Water Act alone.    U.S. District Court Judge Carl Barbier, who has overseen the case, was expected to rule on that issue later this year. Even then, BP would have faced years of lawsuits to address claims by states and by the federal government under a natural resource damage assessment. The settlement announced Thursday closes off those remaining liabilities. “This agreement will not only restore the damage inflicted on our coastal resources by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, it will also allow Louisiana to continue aggressively fighting coastal erosion,” said Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, the hardest hit state. It was not immediately clear how BP will fund the settlement. BP has shed billions in assets to pay for the spill, eroding about one-fifth of the earnings base it had before 2010. BP’s smaller size among the bigger oil majors has made it vulnerable to potential takeovers, especially with the sharp drop in oil prices. “Companies have been slightly hesitant to make a bid while this has been hanging over it, so I think it does clear the way for a potential bid,” said Joe Rundle, head of trading at U.K.-based ETX Capital. BP said the government and the states could jointly demand an acceleration of payments if the company were acquired. Previous settlements also included an uncapped fund originally set at $7.8 billion to compensate individuals claiming economic harm from the spill. BP also settled with Transocean Ltd, which owned the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, and Halliburton Co, which worked on the Macondo well. “Now Gulf Coast restoration can begin in earnest. It’s time to heal the wounds that BP tore in Gulf Coast ecosystems and communities,” said David Yarnold, CEO of the National Audubon Society.

302,HAL,"Halliburton, Baker Hughes extend DoJ review date for deal","(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N have agreed with the U.S. Department of Justice to extend the date of the department’s review of Halliburton’s acquisition of Baker Hughes, a deal that would create an oilfield services behemoth. Halliburton has also proposed to “divest additional businesses of the companies” to get regulatory nod for the deal globally, the companies said on Friday. Several big deals, including Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) $45 billion offer for Time Warner Cable Inc TWC.N, have been scuttled in recent months amid indications that they would be blocked by antitrust regulators. Halliburton’s $35-billion offer for Baker Hughes is being scrutinized by regulators in several countries as the companies have overlapping businesses in the United States, Asia and Europe. Halliburton said in November that it was ready to divest businesses that generate revenue of $7.5 billion. The company said in April that it would sell three of its drilling businesses. The cash-and-stock deal, announced in November, will create an oilfield services provider with higher revenue than market leader Schlumberger NV (SLB.N). The review date has been extended to the later of Nov. 25 or 90 days after Halliburton and Baker Hughes achieve “substantial compliance” with the department’s second request, they said.  The transaction, which was expected to close in the second half, is now expected to close by Dec. 1.  Halliburton shares closed at $41.33 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, while Baker Hughes shares ended at $59.71. Up to Friday’s close, Halliburton shares had fallen about 25 percent since Nov. 14, the last trading day before the deal was announced.

303,HAL,Traders pounce as doubts grow about Halliburton-Baker Hughes deal,"(Reuters) - Growing doubts that regulators may not approve Halliburton Co’s $35-billion takeover of fellow oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc this year has thrown up a high-reward opportunity for investors with an appetite for risk. Typically, investors make money on mergers by picking up shares of the target company once the stock has steadied following their initial surge after the deal is announced. They sell when the shares touch the offer price just a few days before the deal closes, making money off the difference. Baker Hughes’ stock was trading at a discount of 8 percent to $67, which is what Halliburton’s cash-and-stock offer was valued as of Tuesday’s close. This spread has widened over the past three months as several big deals have fallen apart amid anti-trust concerns. The two companies on Friday agreed with the U.S. Department of Justice to extend the date of the department’s review of the deal. The transaction, which was supposed to close in the second half, is now expected to close by Dec. 1. But merger experts said the wide spread means the market remains less confident the deal will be completed this year. “(The agreement) does not remove any regulatory risk as the approval has still not yet been received,” said Roy Behren, portfolio manager at Westchester Capital Management. The risk has created an unusually attractive opening for arbitrageurs to make money by buying Baker Hughes shares while short-selling those of Halliburton. Halliburton’s shares have fallen about 17 percent to $42.56 since the deal was announced. Several big deals have fallen through in recent months amid indications that they would be blocked by anti-trust regulators. Most recently, Comcast Corp abandoned its all-stock $45 billion offer for Time Warner Cable Inc. The Baker Hughes-Halliburton deal is being scrutinized by regulators in several countries because the companies have overlapping businesses in the United States, Asia and Europe. Halliburton, which is counting on the purchase of its smaller rival to cope with a drop in exploration and development spending, has said it is willing to divest businesses. Based on current share prices versus the original offer, the market is pricing in a 65-70 percent chance of the Halliburton-Baker Hughes deal going through, said Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai. Usually, about 90 percent of deals close, analysts said. “It’s a wide spread, which people might want to take advantage of,” said Westchester Capital’s Behren. Behren thinks the deal will close, but he and other investors are hedging risk by shorting Halliburton shares, which will fall if the deal collapses. Short-sellers borrow shares to sell in anticipation that the price will fall. When it does, they buy back the stock and return it to the original owner, pocketing the difference. Nearly 6 percent of Halliburton’s stock was held by short-sellers as on June 30, compared with less than 2 percent before the deal was announced on Nov. 17. At current share prices, betting on the deal offers an 18 percent annualized rate of return, said Behren, who assumes the deal will close by the end of the year. A less-risky deal would be yielding in the mid-single digits, he said.

305,HAL,UPDATE 1-QUOTEBOX-Schlumberger CEO: pricing weak for rest of the year,"(Adds comments on Halliburton and Baker Hughes merger) July 17 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd, the world’s No. 1 oilfield services provider, expects little improvement in pricing levels in the near future as customers continue to keep a tight lid on budgets, it said on a conference call on Friday. The company on Thursday reported a quarterly profit well ahead of expectations as it managed to cut cost of revenue by more than a fifth, softening  the impact of reduced global drilling activity. Schlumberger, which provides drilling technology and equipment to oil and gas companies, expects exploration and production investment in North America to fall by more than 35 percent versus its forecast, in April, of a 30 percent drop. Here is a selection of comments from chief executive Paal Kibsgaard from Friday’s conference call: “The dramatic reduction in activity in US land has created a massive capacity oversupply in the service industry with pricing quickly plummeting to unsustainable levels, in particular for pressure pumping.” “There’s going to be a further impact of pricing in the second half of the year. We haven’t seen the full impact of that.” “There will be little to no improvement in pricing levels in North America and hence the market will still remain very challenging for the foreseeable future.” “On the supply side of the oil market, the global market share battle between OPEC and the high cost producers is still playing out with the first signs of flattening North America production starting to show.” “We do expect that any improvement in oil prices in the second half of the year will potentially lead to increased investment levels in 2016, both for exploration and development related activity.” “We are prepared to carry slightly more cost into Q3 and this is not a significant part. Now, I can’t say 100 percent certain that (growth is) going to come in Q4 or Q1, but what we’re saying is that we believe we are getting close to bottom.” On offshore projects: “Going forward in terms of sanctioning new projects, I think it’s going to be very important for the industry to be able to ... come up with technical solutions and field development plans that significantly reduces cost per barrel.” “We have fully exited Iran. When the sanctions are lifted and when it is permissible, we will evaluate going back in.” On Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc  merger: “It’s a bit difficult for me to say what the impact is. That’s more of a customer question, right? It obviously creates a bit of uncertainty from our customers, firstly, is the transaction going to go through?” “I think it creates uncertainty from the customer side as to how they go about awarding in tender situation and it has probably also led to potentially slightly lower rate of tendering in this part of the cycle.”   (Reporting by Swetha Gopinath, Kanika Sikka, Amrutha Gayathri and Anet Josline Pinto in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh)",7172015,http://www.reuters.com/article/schlumberger-nv-pricing-ceo/update-1-quotebox-schlumberger-ceo-pricing-weak-for-rest-of-the-year-idUSL4N0ZX4AO20150717
306,HAL,Halliburton secures $500 million to fund drilling in old wells,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N) said it had tapped BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) for $500 million to help fund drilling in existing shale wells, the first such move by a major oilfield services provider at a time when oil producers are shying away from drilling new wells. The world’s No.2 oilfield services provider, which is buying No.3 Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N to cope with a fall in demand, also reported a better-than-expected profit, helped by cost cuts. Market leader Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) and Baker Hughes have touted refracking, the practice of fracking existing wells, as means for oil producers to save money. Drilling normally accounts for about 40 percent of the cost of a new well. “Though a relatively small market today, we see significant runway for refrac in the future,” Halliburton President Jeffrey Miller said on a post-earnings call on Monday. Oil and gas companies have said refracking is still too unpredictable, but some such as Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) and Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) are using the technology to revive output from existing wells. The funding could help Halliburton speed up adoption of refracking, Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai said. “I think people are wondering why Halliburton themselves weren’t providing some of that financing.” Halliburton’s shares rose 2.7 percent to $41.05 and Baker Hughes’ rose 2.4 percent to $59.70, while the broader U.S. oil and gas index .DJUSEN was down 1 percent. Halliburton also said it was “fully committed” to buying Baker Hughes, days after the U.S. Department of Justice extended its review of the deal. The company has put up three drilling businesses for sale to alleviate regulatory concerns and said on Monday it was “pleased with the prices and level of interest” it had received. Desai said Halliburton tapped the capital market to help it conserve capital given the Baker Hughes deal and the effect of the oil price slump on its own business. Halliburton’s revenue from North America slumped 38.5 percent in the second quarter ended June 30. Revenue from outside the region fell 12 percent. The company said it expects an “uptick” in activity, including refracking, later this year and a “meaningful recovery” only in 2016. Halliburton’s net profit slumped 93 percent to $53 million in the quarter. Total revenue fell 26.5 percent to $5.92 billion. According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, the company earned 38 cents per share, higher than analysts’ average estimate of 29 cents. Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.78 billion.

Halliburton said on Monday that it was “pleased with the prices and level of interest” it had received. The second source called the potential purchasers “impressive.” The Justice Department concern focused on two areas, according to the first source. One is that the drilling technology businesses would go to small companies that could not effectively compete with the two leaders.

Apple shares slumped as much as 6.7 percent to $121.99, a day after the iPhone maker’s revenue forecast for the fourth quarter fell below expectations. The stock was the biggest drag on all three major indexes and contributed 40 points to the Dow’s overall decline. Microsoft fell as much as 4 percent to $45.35 after reporting its biggest quarterly loss, as the company wrote down its Nokia phone business and demand fell for its Windows operating system. Yahoo was down 0.8 percent at $39.38 after it forecast lower-than-expected revenue for the current quarter as it struggles to revive its core online advertising business. While markets are near record highs, June-quarter earnings of S&P; 500 companies are expected to dip 1.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data, well below the 5.9 percent gain forecast on Jan. 1. So far, 70 percent have reported earnings above analyst expectations, above the 63 percent average beat rate since 1994. However, only 55 percent have topped revenue forecasts, below the 61 percent average beat rate since 2002. U.S. companies are expected to post their worst sales decline in nearly six years in the second quarter, in part due to the strong dollar that reduces the value of U.S. companies’ overseas income. “The question now is if the markets are fully valued and can they move higher without earnings growth,” said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust in Santa Ana, California, which oversees $1.1 billion. Braakman said today’s moves could have been worse but positive results from big names such as Boeing and Coca Cola were helping offset some of the losses. “Ultimately, it’s earnings that drive the market not revenue and a lot of the growth in earnings is expected to come in the second half of the year.” Adding to the day’s weakness, commodities resumed their downward spiral with gold and oil prices under pressure. At 12:47 p.m. ET (1647 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 85.82 points, or 0.48 percent, at 17,833.47, the S&P; 500 was down 7.21 points, or 0.34 percent, at 2,112 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 45.10 points, or 0.87 percent, at 5,163.02. Five of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher with the utilities index leading the advancers with a 0.8 percent rise. The technology index was the biggest laggard with a 1.71 percent fall, its biggest drop in a week.

317,HAL,U.S. oil firms turn to fracking mixology as crude slides again," (Story refiles to correct name in last paragraph to “Beck” from “Bock”) By Ernest Scheyder WILLISTON, N.D. (Reuters) - U.S. oil companies, under renewed pressure from falling crude prices, are increasingly tweaking and mixing fracking technologies as they scramble to squeeze more out of wells and eke out profits after rounds of cost-cutting.  Shale oil firms need the experiments to payoff now more so than before given that oil prices have resumed their slide to trade around $49 per barrel this week from $60 a few months ago. Quarterly earnings - and the reams of data that accompany them - throughout the next few weeks will offer Wall Street the first opportunity to assess those efforts and pick potential winners and losers. When oil fetched $100 a barrel and profits were fatter, most companies followed a similar script. Now, many try to go their own way in a race to bring down the price level at which production remains profitable. Noting the new trend, CapitalOne Securities said in a recent note to clients that mixing up well completion techniques could result in “a step-change in well performance.”  For example, Continental Resources Inc is blending so-called plug and perforate well completion techniques with a “sliding sleeve” approach, betting that gains in oil volumes will outstrip additional costs of using more than one technology. Effectively, Continental divides a well into 30 or more sections, plugging off some and fracking others. For other parts of the well it uses a “sleeve,” a steel device that moves through the well and isolates small sections of a well at a time to be fracked.  The approach has lifted initial production rates as much as 50 percent compared with nearby wells where standard procedures using just one method were applied, Continental president Jack Stark told investors two months ago. Stark will address Wall Street analysts again on August 6 with an update on the new approach. The company is expected to report a 95 percent drop in quarterly profit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  To be sure, it will take months to fully assess the effectiveness of mixing and matching techniques across dozens of wells, though initial production rates, which get reported to state regulators, will offer a first glimpse.  Wells are fracked by injecting a slurry of water, chemicals and sand at high pressure down holes to crack rock and release hydrocarbons. The technology, known for decades, has made big strides in the past six years when shale oil companies developed horizontal drilling that made oilfields more accessible. Whiting Petroleum Corp, North Dakota’s largest oil producer, since this spring has experimented with pumping twice as much sand into a well during fracking as usual and has found it can boost output by as much as 40 percent.  The Denver-based company, which is expected to barely eke out a profit when it reports quarterly results on Wednesday, was so encouraged by the output rise that earlier this month it increased its 2015 budget by 15 percent to $2.3 billion to finish more wells this year. Meanwhile, Hess Corp has opted to stick with just the cheaper “sliding sleeve” technique. Data from state oil regulators show that Hess has some of the most productive wells in North Dakota.  “I want to preserve that efficacy I have with sliding sleeve,” Gerbert Schoonman, vice president in charge of Hess operations in North Dakota’s Bakken shale oil formation, told Reuters. By contrast, Exxon Mobil subsidiary XTO Energy has chosen to continue to use “plug and perforate” in some areas and “sliding sleeve” in others, and not mix them up. Exxon is expected to report a nearly 50 percent drop in quarterly profit on Friday.         “We’re trying to see what process works best in each part of the Bakken,” Tim McIlwain, XTO’s operations chief, said in an interview. Statoil is even looking beyond fracking designs. The Norwegian company is investigating whether artificial proppant shaped like the letter “X” could prove to be more effective at holding open cracks in shale rock than sand or ceramic balls.  The technology, which is still being tested, came from a competition for scientists Statoil held earlier this year with General Electric Co to find new styles of proppant. “You can get more diameter out of the ‘X’ with less material than you could if it were a sphere of a sand grain,” said Gene Beck, Statoil’s North Dakota operations chief.

323,HAL,"REFILE-RPT-'Frack now, pay later,' top services companies say amid oil crash","(Fixes spelling of Paal in 18th paragraph) By Terry Wade and Anna Driver HOUSTON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Business is so tough for oilfield giants Schlumberger NV and Halliburton Co that they have come up with a new sales pitch for crude producers halting work in the worst downturn in years. It amounts to this: “frack now and pay later.” The moves by the world’s No. 1 and No. 2 oil services companies show how they are scrambling to book sales of new technologies to customers short of cash after a 60 percent slide in crude to $45 a barrel. In some cases, they are willing to take on the role of traditional lenders, like banks, which have grown reluctant to lend since the price drop that began last summer, or act like producers by taking what are essentially stakes in wells. At Halliburton, some of the capital to finance the sales will come from $500 million in backing from asset manager BlackRock, part of a wave of alternative finance pouring into the energy industry that one Houston lawyer said on Thursday allows companies to “keep the engine running.” When its second-quarter net profit tumbled by more than half a billion dollars to just $54 million, Halliburton’s Chief Executive Dave Lesar told analysts the company needed to find new revenue. The BlackRock money, he said, would allow Halliburton to “look at additional ways of doing business with our customers, different business models, push beyond where we have been today.” Halliburton declined to provide additional details, including how many customers it has for its financing program, citing confidential dealings with clients. Schlumberger has said it has eight onshore refracking clients in North America. Another variant, which Halliburton has considered and Schlumberger has pushed, is one in which the companies cover up-front costs for a producer and then get a piece of a well’s performance. The services companies have made these special offers to producers in a bid to roll out the new business line of refracking, in which existing wells are worked over to lift output. Halliburton and Schlumberger tout refracking as a cheap way of adding barrels because it avoids drilling new wells, which can cost several million dollars each. One way to refrack involves injecting tiny rubber-coated balls and reactive fluids that can later dissolve in a well to seal off existing fissures in rock. This boosts pressure. Then, new cracks in rock that release oil are created with a pressurized frack slurry of sand, water and chemicals. It is not yet clear how much business refracking will generate. Oilfield services analyst Angie Sedita at the Swiss bank UBS said in a note to clients that refracking will “not be enough of a demand driver” in 2016 and will take time to make inroads. Two prominent shale producers, EOG Resources Inc and Anadarko Petroleum Corp, have both said refracking technology needs improvement. Others, including Chesapeake Energy Corp and Devon Energy Corp have said they have been refracking and are happy with the results. Devon said this week it has refracked 1,000 wells over the years in North Texas and indicated it has no plans to tap unusual financing from a service company. A few dozen wells have been refracked twice and the company said it is working on newer generation refracking methods for its large inventory of wells. “We’ve got a great opportunity there and we’re continuing to prosecute that on our own,” Tony Vaughn, Devon’s executive vice president for exploration and production said on Wednesday. Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard has acknowledged producers might be unwilling to give up output from a well they think will be lucrative, and instead choose a traditional services contract. “It’s just a reflection of do they want to capture more of the value themselves or would they like to outsource all the risk and potentially much more of the upside to us?,” he said on the company’s July results call.

329,HAL,Halliburton to pay $18.3 million overtime wages: Labor Department,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co will pay $18.3 million to more than 1,000 oil and gas workers it improperly exempted from overtime pay, the U.S. Department of Labor said on Tuesday, the latest development in a nationwide probe into wage practices in the industry. The department said Halliburton improperly identified workers in 28 job categories as exempt from overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. law governing wages and working hours. The company said it had begun paying the overtime and was cooperating with the Labor Department. The settlement is one of the largest for the Labor Department in recent years in an overtime case.  Under the law, employees are entitled to mandatory overtime pay only if they earn less than $455 weekly or have few or no management duties. The Obama administration recently proposed more than doubling the income threshold, rankling business groups and Republican officials.  The Labor Department said Halliburton automatically exempted all salaried workers from overtime without considering their income or job duties. “Ignorance is never an excuse for violating the law,” said Betty Campbell, a Labor Department official, in a statement.  A Halliburton spokeswoman said the company independently discovered that workers had been misclassified during an internal audit and began paying workers overtime as required by the law.  “Throughout this process, Halliburton has worked earnestly and cooperatively with the U.S. Department of Labor to equitably resolve this situation,” she said.  The company will pay $18.3 million to 1,016 employees. Halliburton has 70,000 employees in more than 80 countries. The Halliburton investigation was part of a larger ongoing probe into the oil and gas industry’s pay practices, particularly in U.S. states in the Southwest and Northeast. In December, the Labor Department announced that a number of companies involved in natural gas drilling in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, including Chesapeake Energy and Citrus Energy, would collectively pay $4.5 million to more than 5,300 workers who were improperly exempted from overtime pay.  Halliburton, which has been hit by slumping crude oil prices and is buying Bakers Hughes Inc in a $35 billion deal, is cutting more than 14,000 jobs.

337,HAL,RPT-U.S. mutual funds that bet bigger on energy sector get burned,"(Repeats with no changes to text) By Tim McLaughlin BOSTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - One-in-four U.S. large-cap mutual funds have increased their stakes in energy companies this year and many have suffered heavier losses than their peers as a result of ill-timed bets. The moves into shares of frackers, refiners and integrated oil conglomerates reflect a gamble that the sector will rebound after rising supply and slowing global growth triggered a nearly 60 percent slide in crude prices since the middle of 2014. But so far, the gambit has not paid off. “We are kind of holding our nose to buy them, but we see value there,” said Ernesto Ramos, who oversees about $15 billion in large-cap equity assets at BMO Asset Management. “We’ve been selling the defensive part of the portfolio exposed negatively to higher interest rates, such as consumer staples and utilities, and making room for what we see as a slow but gradual recovery in world growth.” BMO’s Large-Cap Value Fund boosted it energy exposure to 13 percent from 10 percent at the end of February after buying more shares of ExxonMobil Corp and refiner Valero Energy Corp , for example. With oil prices down, ExxonMobil is seen as a defensive play because its refineries and chemicals manufacturing can benefit from lower input costs and offset lower profits from crude production. Shares of Exxon and other oil majors, such as Chevron Corp  and ConocoPhillips are hardly doing any better than the S&P; 500 Energy Index, which is down 25 percent this year. Exxon shares are off 21 percent, while Chevron and Conoco are down 32 percent and 34 percent, respectively, reflecting expectations that the global crude supply glut will persist, ultimately weighing on their returns. A Reuters analysis of 265 actively managed large-cap funds with at least $500 million in assets and combined assets of about $1.8 trillion, revealed that 25 percent of them increased their energy sector bets this year. That overall group of funds produced an average return of minus 7.17 percent so far this year, according to Lipper Inc, a Thomson Reuters company. And three-quarters of the funds that increased  their exposure to energy performed worse than the overall average. (Graphic: link.reuters.com/mug75w) Investors have not been pleased with the shift, pulling nearly $27 billion from funds that increased exposure to energy, according to Lipper data. Those which did not, saw about the same amount of net investor withdrawals, but over a larger number of funds with nearly five times more in assets, Lipper data shows. BMO’s Ramos said managers and investors have to remain patient with their energy picks. “We think we will eventually be rewarded with these stocks,” he said. The $2 billion Ridgeworth Large Cap Value Equity Fund  made among the biggest bets on the energy sector among its peers earlier this year, raising its exposure to 14 percent at the end of August from 6.7 percent at the end of February, according to Lipper. The fund nearly doubled its stake in ConocoPhillips and bought more shares in EOG Resources, Hess Corp and Noble Energy Inc, disclosures show. All of those stocks are down at least 19 percent over the past three months, badly underperforming broad benchmarks. The Ridgeworth fund’s year-to-date total return of minus 13 percent is worse than 88 percent of similar funds, according to Morningstar Inc. Mills Riddick, manager of the fund, declined to comment for this story. Other portfolio managers who bet big on some energy stocks, thinking they found bottom, or somewhere near it, have been sorely disappointed, too. Take the $68 billion Investment Company of America fund , which bought nearly 23 million shares of former shale oil boom star Chesapeake Energy Corp during the first half of the year. That represented just 0.50 percent of the fund’s assets, but still hurt as Chesapeake shares dropped 43 percent during that time. Chesapeake stock has fallen 70 percent since November, and 39 percent since June, to below $7 a share. The fund, run by Capital Group’s American Funds, declined to comment, saying as a matter of policy the company does not discuss individual holdings. The fund’s year-to-date total return of minus 8.90 percent is worse than that of 66 percent of peers, according to Lipper. The fund is not alone as many other managers have made bets on the belief that the slump in oil prices would be short-lived. By contrast, large-cap portfolio managers that did not get caught up in the shale oil boom and remained skeptical about crude recovery delivered positive returns for their investors, according to the analysis. Sonu Kalra, manager of the $20 billion Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund, has kept his portfolio’s exposure to energy below 2 percent of assets. His fund’s year-to-date total return of minus 2.85 percent is better than that of 73 percent of its peers. This year he has eliminated positions in oil refiner Hess and oilfield services provider Halliburton Co while hunting for more information technology stocks. He said what a portfolio manager chooses to avoid can often be as important as what to own. “It has been that type of year.”    (Reporting By Tim McLaughlin; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Tomasz Janowski)",9302015,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-funds-energy/rpt-u-s-mutual-funds-that-bet-bigger-on-energy-sector-get-burned-idUSL1N12002D20150930

The Ridgeworth fund’s year-to-date total return of minus 13 percent is worse than 88 percent of similar funds, according to Morningstar Inc. Mills Riddick, manager of the fund, declined to comment for this story. Other portfolio managers who bet big on some energy stocks, thinking they found bottom, or somewhere near it, have been sorely disappointed, too. Take the $68 billion Investment Company of America fund , which bought nearly 23 million shares of former shale oil boom star Chesapeake Energy Corp during the first half of the year. That represented just 0.50 percent of the fund’s assets, but still hurt as Chesapeake shares dropped 43 percent during that time. Chesapeake stock has fallen 70 percent since November, and 39 percent since June, to below $7 a share. The fund, run by Capital Group’s American Funds, declined to comment, saying as a matter of policy the company does not discuss individual holdings. The fund’s year-to-date total return of minus 8.90 percent is worse than that of 66 percent of peers, according to Lipper. The fund is not alone as many other managers have made bets on the belief that the slump in oil prices would be short-lived. By contrast, large-cap portfolio managers that did not get caught up in the shale oil boom and remained skeptical about crude recovery delivered positive returns for their investors, according to the analysis. Sonu Kalra, manager of the $20 billion Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund, has kept his portfolio’s exposure to energy below 2 percent of assets. His fund’s year-to-date total return of minus 2.85 percent is better than that of 73 percent of its peers. This year he has eliminated positions in oil refiner Hess and oilfield services provider Halliburton Co while hunting for more information technology stocks. He said what a portfolio manager chooses to avoid can often be as important as what to own. “It has been that type of year.”    (Reporting By Tim McLaughlin; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Tomasz Janowski)",9302015,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-funds-energy/u-s-mutual-funds-that-bet-bigger-on-energy-sector-get-burned-idUSL5N11Y3ZK20150930
339,HAL,RPT-UPDATE 3-U.S. says BP to pay $20 bln in fines for 2010 oil spill,"(Repeats to widen distribution; no changes to headline or text) WASHINGTON, Oct 5 (Reuters) - BP Plc will pay more than $20 billion in fines to resolve nearly all claims from its deadly Gulf of Mexico oil spill five years ago, marking the largest corporate settlement of its kind in U.S. history, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on Monday. The agreement, first outlined in July, adds to the $43.8 billion BP had previously set aside for criminal and civil penalties and cleanup costs. The company has said its total pre-tax charge for the spill is now around $53.8 billion. (link.reuters.com/duz94w) The total penalties Lynch announced on Monday sounded higher than the $18.7 billion deal reached to this summer, in part because she included $1 billion in restoration work BP had agreed to long beforehand. BP’s shares rose nearly 3 percent in New York to $33.45 each. Investors have praised the agreement as essentially capping liabilities that could have been much larger. The fines - to be paid to the federal government, five Gulf Coast states and hundreds of municipalities over 18 years - will fund environmental restoration and economic development programs to address the worst offshore spill in U.S. history. “This agreement will launch one of the largest environmental restoration efforts the world has ever seen,” Lynch said. The spill fouled 1,300 miles of coastline and dumped more than three million barrels of crude into the sea, hurting fishermen and prompting overhauls of safety rules and emergency plans in one of the world’s most prolific offshore oil basins. The core of the agreement includes $7.1 billion for natural resource damages, $5.5 billion for Clean Water Act fines, and $4.9 billion in payments to states. The Macondo well blowout and the fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20, 2010 killed 11 workers. Federal and state officials formally filed the settlement on Monday and it should be approved by a U.S. District Court in Louisiana soon. “The filing of the consent decree does not reflect a new settlement or any new money,” BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said. In the past, BP has paid for liabilities by shedding assets, eroding about one-fifth of the earnings base it had before 2010. Its smaller size among the bigger oil majors has made it vulnerable to potential takeovers, analysts have said. BP has effectively settled all big claims from the spill. Previous settlements included a fund originally set at $7.8 billion to compensate individuals claiming economic harm from the spill. Other settlements included one with contractors Transocean Ltd and Halliburton Co.

Halliburton and bigger rival Schlumberger Ltd’s (SLB.N) disappointing results highlight the struggles of the oil and gas industry, which is seeing little hope of a rebound in crude oil prices The outlook for the battered industry continues to look gloomy even as Venezuela, an OPEC partner, plans to set a price band of $70 per barrel to stabilize the oil market. Analysts have said the plan would be doomed from the start as Saudi Arabia, the group’s de facto leader, has so far shown zero interest in returning to a strategy of supporting prices. Brent oil LCOc1 was down 3.1 percent at $48.87 per barrel on Monday. Halliburton further cut its 2015 capital budget by $200 million to $2.4 billion and said it had reduced global headcount by 21 percent since the beginning of the year. The company also said fourth-quarter revenue and margins were likely to be flat to modestly low compared with the prior quarter. “In North America, the prospects of reduced borrowing capacity for operators in a prolonged holiday season make the fourth quarter challenging and difficult to predict,” Halliburton’s acting CFO Christian Garcia, said. Chief Executive David Lesar said he expected customer budgets to reload in the first quarter, leading to a recovery in the second half of 2016. However, industry leader Schlumberger, which posted a 33 percent drop in quarterly revenue last week, said it did not expect a recovery in demand before 2017.

355,HAL,UPDATE 2-US regulators seek more concessions for Halliburton-Baker Hughes deal,"(Adds official statement, changes source, updates shares) Dec 15 (Reuters) - Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc said U.S. antitrust officials were not satisfied with the concessions they offered to win approval for their proposed merger, but said officials would assess further proposals. The two oilfield service providers said it was unlikely they would be able to settle with the U.S. Department of Justice by Tuesday, set as the earliest closing date for the deal. “Both companies strongly believe that the divestiture package, which recently was significantly enhanced to address the DOJ’s specific competitive concerns, is more than sufficient to address concerns raised by competition authorities, including the DOJ,” they said in a statement. The two companies also extended the deadline for closing the proposed merger, which would create the second-largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger Ltd, to April 30, 2016. The merger was announced last year. Halliburton and Baker Hughes said they remained focused on completing the merger “as early as possible in 2016”, but warned there was no guarantee that an agreement with the DOJ or other competition authorities would be reached. Baker Hughes shares were marginally lower, while Halliburton was up 1.2 percent in late afternoon trading on Tuesday. Both stocks were much higher earlier amid a broad rally in energy stocks due to recovering oil prices. The earliest closing date for the deal was extended to Dec. 15 after U.S. regulators requested more information. The merger was originally expected to close in late November. But Halliburton’s acting chief financial officer said last week that the deal would likely close in 2016 as talks with U.S. regulators continued. The two companies had agreed to divest $5.2 billion in overlapping businesses to address concerns that the merger would lead to higher prices and less innovation. The deal has so far won regulatory approvals in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Turkey, but is awaiting approval in countries such as Australia and Brazil. The European Commission has been reviewing the deal since Nov. 27 when Halliburton re-filed a request for approval after an earlier application was dismissed as providing insufficient data. The preliminary scrutiny is scheduled to end on Jan. 12. Halliburton was to meet EU antitrust regulators this week and would likely be told about competition worries, Reuters reported on Friday.

Halliburton presented “an enhanced set of proposed divestitures” to the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this month, CEO Dave Lesar said on a post-earnings call. The company reported a better-than-expected profit on Monday as deep cost cuts helped offset a drop in drilling activity. Halliburton has also informally notified the European Commission and other jurisdictions of the new sale plan, Lesar said on the call. He did not specify what the company would divest, but said Halliburton was in talks with interested buyers. Halliburton and Baker Hughes have so far disclosed plans to divest overlapping businesses, with combined 2013 revenue of $5.2 billion, to address concerns that their deal would lead to higher prices and less innovation. Total divestitures could be as much as $10 billion on a 2013 basis, according to Evercore ISI analyst James West. Still, it is “positive” that the DOJ has not tried to block the merger, West said. Some other analysts were more skeptical. “We are not as favorable on the timing and the potential for (the deal) to go through as we were previously,” said Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai. Baker Hughes and Halliburton have extended the deadline for closing the deal - first announced in November 2014 - to April 30. Lesar said on Monday the merger agreement would not automatically terminate even if regulatory approvals do not come in by April 30. Both companies may continue to seek regulatory approval, or either company may terminate the deal, he said.

369,HAL,"UPDATE 10-Oil up 3 pct on March producers meeting, U.S. project delays","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil futures jumped 3 percent on Thursday, reversing earlier loses after confirmation of a meeting of major producers and news of project delays and job cuts in the industry. Venezuela reaffirmed a mid-March meeting of oil producers that would include Saudi Arabia, Russia and Qatar, to stabilize prices that have slumped 70 percent in a 20-month rout. The four countries are involved in an effort to get oil producers in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and elsewhere to freeze production at January’s highs. Many traders believe an output cut and not freeze is what the market needs to clear the global crude glut. “It’s the Venezuela headline that got the market excited enough to rebound, though it’s baffling why as everyone knows of this meeting and that it’s not going to achieve anything,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital, a New York energy hedge fund. U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled up 92 cents, or 2.9 percent, at $33.07 a barrel. It had slid more than $1 at the session low. Brent crude futures LCOc1 finished up 88 cents, or 2.6 percent, at $35.29 a barrel, hitting a three-week high. It had also dropped more than $1 earlier. The rally in crude also boosted gasoline futures RBc1, which settled up nearly 5 percent after rallying from early in the day on strong demand for the motor fuel. USOILG=ECI  Aside from the March meeting, traders said sentiment in oil was helped by project deferments in the U.S. shale industry and job cuts that will slow production. Continental Resources Inc (CLR.N), one of the biggest shale drillers in North Dakota, said it planned to continue deferring project completions in the Bakken fields due to low crude prices. Oil services provider Halliburton said it will start a new round of global layoffs that will cut 5,000 jobs. Oil prices had fallen as much 3 percent earlier on Thursday after data indicating new record highs in U.S. crude inventories. Stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery point for U.S. crude futures rose by more than 503,000 barrels to reach above 67.5 million barrels between Feb. 19 and Feb. 24, traders said, quoting data by market intelligence provider Genscape. Officially, the U.S. government reported on Wednesday that Cushing added 333,000 barrels last week to reach 65.1 million for a fourth straight week of record highs. Nationwide, inventories rose to all-time peaks above 507 million barrels.

379,HAL,U.S. regulator sues ValueAct over Halliburton-Baker Hughes disclosures,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice on Monday sued ValueAct Capital for violating notification requirements related to Halliburton Co’s (HAL.N) deal to buy rival Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N, in a case that the activist hedge fund says it will fight.  The lawsuit centers on a 40-year old U.S. law that exempts investors who buy up to 10 percent of a company’s voting securities from disclosing purchases made only for passive investment purposes. The Department of Justice alleges that ValueAct was an active investor from the time it started to build its position in both companies shortly after the November 2014 merger agreement, and that the hedge fund violated the law - known as the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act - by waiting too long to disclose its intentions. “Plainly the regulators are trying to send a message that their view of what constitutes passivity is far more restrictive than what some portfolio managers apparently believe,” said Christopher Davis, a partner at law firm Kleinberg Kaplan who chairs its mergers practice.  The lawsuit said ValueAct used its access to senior Halliburton and Baker Hughes executives to formulate the merger and other strategies. The government is seeking a civil penalty of at least $19 million - a penalty it deemed “significant.” “ValueAct was not entitled to avoid HSR requirements by claiming to be a passive investor,” Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division said in a press release. ValueAct, a $16 billion activist hedge fund, said it will contest the case, a departure from similar violation lawsuits that ended with investors settling with the government. “We fundamentally disagree with the Department of Justice’s allegations in this case,” the San Francisco-based hedge fund said in an emailed statement. The lawsuit is another recent blow to ValueAct, which since August has had to stomach huge paper losses on its investment in embattled drug company Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX.N), which is under federal investigation.   ValueAct said having a relationship with a company’s management, conducting due diligence and engaging with other stock owners are basic principles of shareholder rights.  At issue is what defines passive investing. For ValueAct and other activist shareholders, engaging with management teams directly is a key part of their strategy to push for changes that activists feel is needed to boost a company’s stock price. In the government’s case against ValueAct, federal officials used emails to underscore their case that the hedge fund crossed the “passive” boundary as early as a month after the Halliburton agreement. The lawsuit says that on Dec. 5, 2014, the day ValueAct’s Halliburton holdings crossed the HSR Act threshold, a ValueAct partner sent an email to ValueAct’s founder and CEO Jeffrey Ubben suggesting a new compensation structure for Halliburton’s chief executive. The partner suggested that the compensation plan of Valeant’s CEO - a plan that is heavily weighted toward stock-based incentives - would be a good model for Halliburton’s chief executive, the government says in its complaint, to which Ubben agreed.  Halliburton is still awaiting regulatory approval for the acquisition, which was worth $35 billion when it was announced but has since fallen by nearly half, hit by the plunge in oil prices. The Hart Scott Rodino Act provides the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice with information about large mergers and acquisitions. Last August, Third Point LLC settled U.S. FTC charges that it failed to properly seek HSR clearance while it built a stake in Yahoo Inc YHOO.O in 2011. The hedge fund did not pay a penalty but entered a five-year agreement to make appropriate disclosures.  In the case of ValueAct, the hedge fund bought Halliburton and Baker Hughes shares shortly after the merger, having previously been a Halliburton shareholder.  In January 2015, ValueAct said in a regulatory filing that it owned more than 5 percent of Baker Hughes shares. In October that same year, with oil prices plunging and confidence in the deal sagging, it amended the filing to say that it was going to take an activist position in Baker Hughes. The following month, ValueAct filed its HSR disclosure, a person familiar with the matter said.  ValueAct’s Halliburton-Baker Hughes holdings have cost the fund dearly in paper losses, Reuters previously reported.    The Justice Department noted on Monday that ValueAct filed “corrective notifications” for three acquisitions in 2003 and two years later, failed to inform the government of three acquisitions, paying a $1.1 million civil penalty.

The move, which comes after months of talks on divestitures of some overlapping businesses, significantly cuts the chances of the deal going through, although Halliburton said it would “vigorously contest” the lawsuit.  The Justice Department said the merger, valued at $35 billion when it was first announced in November 2014, would leave only two dominant suppliers in 20 business lines in the global well drilling and oil construction services industry, with Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) being one of the two. In 11 of those lines, ranging from offshore well cementing to onshore fracking plugs, a combined Halliburton-Baker Hughes would have more than 50 percent of the market and in two cases more than 80 percent of the market. “The proposed deal between Halliburton and Baker Hughes would eliminate vital competition, skew energy markets and harm American consumers,” U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement on Wednesday. “Our action makes clear that the Justice Department is committed to vigorously enforcing our antitrust laws.” The Justice Department said that Halliburton had offered divestitures aimed at saving the deal but that these were inadequate.  “I have seen a lot of problematic mergers in my time. But I have never seen one that poses so many antitrust problems in so many markets,” said Bill Baer, head of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, in a conference call with reporters. Halliburton disagreed. “The companies believe that the DOJ (Justice Department) has reached the wrong conclusion in its assessment of the transaction and that its action is counterproductive, especially in the context of the challenges the U.S. and global energy industry are currently experiencing,” the company said in a statement. The companies also face difficulties with European antitrust regulators, which last month halted scrutiny of the deal for a second time, saying the companies had yet to provide an important piece of information. Halliburton shares were up 6.9 percent on Wednesday at $36.76 while Baker Hughes shares were up 8 percent at $42.65. Based on Halliburton’s latest share price, the deal would be worth $26 billion. The company’s shares have tumbled more than 35 percent over the past two years as a slumping oil price has hurt its customers.  If the deal collapses due to antitrust concerns, Halliburton must pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee, according to regulatory filings.     Despite that, Wall Street analysts generally agreed Halliburton would be in better shape than Baker Hughes if the deal fell through. “Halliburton would be just fine if the deal didn’t go through, even with the breakup fee,” said Rob Desai, an analyst with Edward Jones.  Halliburton’s profit margins would improve on a standalone basis because it had kept a relatively high cost structure and was holding off on deeper cutbacks until after the deal closed, analysts said. Without the distractions of integration work, it could also be more agile, they said.     Evercore ISI’s James West said Halliburton’s stock price could improve to $42 a share, or $45 excluding the breakup fee, which is worth $2.65 a share. Baker Hughes, as the acquisition target, was seen as facing greater difficulties if the deal does not go ahead. “Given the employee turnover, the cannibalization of its equipment at the onset of the downturn, and the general disorder within the company, we believe standalone-Baker Hughes’ revenue growth and margin improvement would lag its peers,” West said in a note.

395,HAL,U.S. lawsuit against activist ValueAct puts mutual funds on alert,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government’s lawsuit against ValueAct Capital targets one activist investor but could call into question routine practices across the $16 trillion mutual fund industry, according to attorneys and industry representatives. The U.S. Department of Justice last week alleged that the hedge fund improperly classified two company investments as passive - and therefore exempt from disclosure requirements - while taking an activist role with executives. ValueAct disputes the claim. Some communications the government cites as evidence are similar to discussions that are increasingly common between traditional, buy-and-hold funds and companies in their portfolios. The case comes as active and passive investors work more together to pressure management at underperforming companies. Activists court passive shareholders before launching such a campaign, and passive investors recruit activists to agitate, several activist managers told Reuters.  Traditional funds may need to reassess their compliance with disclosure laws, according to a memo to clients from Davis Polk, a New York law firm with expertise in financial services. “Such an institution will have to examine whether it can claim to have a truly ‘passive’ intent,” said the memo, issued in response to the ValueAct case. Those firms could include, for instance, T. Rowe Price Group (TROW.O), BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and Vanguard Group. Spokespeople at those companies declined to comment, and representatives of seven additional fund firms contacted by Reuters declined to comment or said executives were unavailable. The Justice Department also declined to comment. An industry trade group said the case could restrain shareholders from addressing important issues with corporate executives and board directors. “The DOJ case could have a chilling effect on dialogues between companies and their shareholders,” said Amy Borrus, deputy director at the Council of Institutional Investors, a Washington D.C.-based nonprofit whose members include pensions, endowments and major mutual funds. For a graphic showing the increase in company shareholder communication programs, see tmsnrt.rs/25PYHpm Competition for better returns has led some big mutual fund firms to take a more active role, weighing in on issues such as CEO pay and corporate governance. Vanguard Chairman and CEO William McNabb, in a speech last June in New York, described how the firm increasingly addresses matters of concern with companies in its portfolio. “We’ve become more targeted in whom we mailed letters to and more prescriptive in our language,” McNabb said. For example, Vanguard sent out 500 letters in March 2015 to independent chairs and lead directors outlining six principles of corporate governance, McNabb said. At the heart of the ValueAct case are six words in a 40-year-old law that requires disclosure of certain investments to assist the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission in antitrust review of mergers. The intent is to prevent investors from secretly buying up stakes to agitate for industry consolidation. The Hart-Scott-Rodino Act requires all buyers of voting securities worth more than $76.3 million to notify the government, unless they were bought “solely for the purpose of investment.” The government alleges ValueAct failed to disclose a $2.5 billion position in two companies that planned to merge - oilfield services peers Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Industries Inc. BHI.N ValueAct is fighting the case and has said that its outreach to the companies was standard shareholder input and not active investing. The firm declined to comment for this story. Among the evidence asserted by the government is a December 2014 meeting with the Baker Hughes chief financial officer, where ValueAct’s chief executive discussed gaps in the company’s North American margins and other underperforming areas. The government also cited a ValueAct email sent to Halliburton’s CEO in July 2015 to schedule a meeting about executive compensation. Davis Polk points out in its client memo that it’s common for investors with stakes deemed passive to discuss those topics with corporate management. “It does seem to be ... a typical subject of discussion,” wrote the firm, which represents Baker Hughes in the merger. John Briggs, an antitrust attorney with the law firm Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider LLP, called the case a one-off enforcement effort against ValueAct that does not necessarily signal a broader crackdown or a change in legal interpretation. But Briggs agreed that the case highlights the blurring boundaries between activist and traditional fund managers. A ValueAct win could further cloud the issue, while a government victory could prompt major investors to dial back pressure on companies. A managing director at a large asset manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that he and his colleagues routinely discuss business improvement and executive compensation with company executives, believing such topics do not cross legal lines. The ValueAct case could change that interpretation, the manager said. The lawsuit could take months or years to resolve. Any resulting limits on fund managers could clash with a separate effort led by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the early 1990s encouraging more dialogue between investors and public corporations. “The idea was that you want to free up those conversations, since more conversations allow more accountability,” said University of Delaware finance professor Charles Elson, who follows corporate governance. “Anything that pushes things in a different direction is problematic.” ",4122016,http://www.reuters.com/article/valueact-lawsuit-funds/u-s-lawsuit-against-activist-valueact-puts-mutual-funds-on-alert-idUSL2N17F1TD

Halliburton also postponed its earnings conference call to May 3 from April 25 to accommodate the April 30 deadline to close its acquisition of Baker Hughes Inc, the company said in a statement after the U.S. market closed on Friday. The No.2 oilfield services provider is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Monday, April 25. Baker Hughes is due to report on April 27, but has not held conference calls since the merger was announced in 2014. While the deal will help Halliburton narrow the gap with market leader Schlumberger Ltd, it faces stiff regulatory hurdles. The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit this month to block the deal. European Union antitrust regulators could make its objections to the deal known to Halliburton next week, Reuters reported on Wednesday. The merger was in part to help weather the oil price downturn that started in mid-2014, and its aftermath. Since 2014, Halliburton has reduced its headcount by about a third and slashed costs as its clients sharply reduce activity. “Life has changed in the energy industry,” CEO Dave Lesar said. President Jeff Miller said, “My definition of an unsustainable market is one where all service companies are losing money in North America, which is where we are now.” The company’s first-quarter revenue dropped to $4.2 billion from $7.05 billion. Miller said Halliburton’s margins have been resilient, with “decremental margins of only 22 percent for the quarter.” Schlumberger on Thursday reported negative margins for North America for the first time since the oil slump started. Margins become negative when costs exceed revenue earned. Halliburton said it expects spending on drilling and completion services to fall 50 percent in North America this year, following a 40 percent decline last year. It expects global spending to drop 30 percent for the second straight year. U.S. energy firms cut oil rigs this week to the lowest level since November 2009, Baker Hughes said. Halliburton said it expects that the second quarter will mark the “landing point” for rig count. The company said it typically sees margins improving at least a one quarter after rig count flattens.

Lewis, who will receive an annual base salary of 775,000 pounds ($1.13 million) takes over at a company facing record-low investments from its key oil and gas customers amid weak oil prices.

412,HAL,Halliburton and Baker Hughes scrap $28 billion merger,"(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N announced the termination of their $28 billion merger deal on Sunday after opposition from U.S. and European antitrust regulators. The tie-up would have brought together the world’s No. 2 and No. 3 oil services companies, raising concerns it would result in higher prices in the sector. It is the latest example of a large merger deal failing to make it to the finish line because of antitrust hurdles. “Challenges in obtaining remaining regulatory approvals and general industry conditions that severely damaged deal economics led to the conclusion that termination is the best course of action,” said Dave Lesar, chief executive of Halliburton. The contract governing Halliburton’s cash-and-stock acquisition of Baker Hughes, which was valued at $34.6 billion when it was announced in November 2014, and is now worth about $28 billion, expired on Saturday without an agreement by the companies to extend it, Reuters reported earlier on Sunday, citing a person familiar with the matter.  Halliburton will pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee by Wednesday as a result of the deal falling apart.  The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit last month to stop the merger, arguing it would leave only two dominant suppliers in 20 business lines in the global well drilling and oil construction services industry, with Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) being the other. “The companies’ decision to abandon this transaction – which would have left many oilfield service markets in the hands of a duopoly – is a victory for the U.S. economy and for all Americans,” U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in a statement on Sunday. The European Commission also previously expressed concerns that the deal might reduce competition and innovation. The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which enforce U.S. antitrust law, have filed lawsuits to stop an unusually high number of deals in the past 18 months. Lynch said last month that the number of big and complex deals being proposed made it “a unique moment in antitrust enforcement.” The collapse of Halliburton’s acquisition of Baker Hughes comes as both companies struggle to cope with the impact that lower energy prices are having on their clients.  Last week, Baker Hughes reported a bigger-than-expected first-quarter loss and warned that the rig count globally would drop steadily through the end of the year because of fewer new projects. Halliburton said last month it cut more than 6,000 jobs in the first quarter as revenue slumped 40.4 percent and it took a $2.1 billion restructuring charge mainly for severance costs and asset write-offs. The merger’s cancellation also represents a blow to the investment bankers who advised the companies, as their fee, typically in the range of a percentage point of a deal’s value, is largely predicated upon the transaction being completed.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) advised Baker Hughes, while Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) was lead financial adviser to Halliburton, with Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) also advising.

415,HAL,Halliburton aims to boost weak businesses after failed Baker Hughes deal,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N) said it would consider acquisitions to bolster its weaker businesses as the world’s No. 2 oilfield services company looked to move on after abandoning a deal to buy smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N. The deal would have helped Halliburton better compete with market-leader Schlumberger (SLB.N) for the dwindling number of contracts from oil producers as crude prices stay stubbornly low. While Halliburton is the market-leader in fracturing, cementing, and completion services, acquiring Baker Hughes would have boosted its artificial lift and production chemicals businesses, where the company is not dominant. “We are going to invest in those product lines where we’re a little bit weak, and we’ll look at selective acquisitions to round them out,” Halliburton Chief Executive Dave Lesar said on a post call with analysts. He did not elaborate.  During the 18-month period when Halliburton and Baker Hughes were trying to win regulators over to their merger, Schlumberger bought equipment maker Cameron International Corp to strengthen its drilling and production systems. Seaport Global Securities analyst Kenneth Sill said it remained to be seen if the deal changed the competitive landscape. “Halliburton has the best exposure in North American onshore completions, strongest pressure pumping in the world. So they are in great shape,” Sill said. Halliburton called off the Baker Hughes deal on Sunday after stiff opposition from U.S. and European antitrust regulators. Lesar stressed on Tuesday that he believed the deal would have been pro-competitive, but said the continued drop in oil prices had eroded some of the expected cost advantages and made it difficult to get “adequate value” for proposed divestitures. Still the abandoned deal has a silver lining for both companies in that they can now reduce costs that they were maintaining as a requirement for the deal. Halliburton said it would reduce “structural costs” by about 25 percent, or $1 billion, on an annual run-rate basis by the end of 2016. Baker Hughes plans to cut annual costs by about $500 million. The companies have been cutting costs to protect margins. Net loss attributable to Halliburton widened to $2.41 billion in the first quarter from $643 million a year earlier, due to $2.77 billion in asset impairment and other charges. Excluding charges, Halliburton’s earnings of 7 cents per share beat analysts’ estimates of 4 cents.

427,HAL,Halliburton signals better demand for fracking equipment,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co indicated that demand for its fracking equipment was returning, despite the fewer number of rigs at work, as high-intensity shale drilling soaked up all the available capacity in the market. Halliburton is the world’s largest provider of equipment used in hydraulic fracturing or fracking - the process of pumping water and chemicals, known as proppants, into shale rocks to extract oil and gas. U.S. shale oil producers - Halliburton’s customers - are now drilling longer horizontal wells with multiple fracking stages, and deploying more horsepower and proppants to cover larger areas. This high-intensity drilling is boosting demand for fracking equipment. “Let me start today with a headline: 900 is the new 2,000 for U.S. rig activity,” the company’s president, Jeff Miller, said on a post-earnings call on Wednesday. “I believe it will only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market.” The company reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and said it expected a “modest uptick” in rig count in the second half of the year. The U.S. rig count climbed by 7 to 447 in the week ended July 15, but is far short of the 1,931 at work in September 2014. Demand for Halliburton and rival Schlumberger NV’s fracking equipment has also received a boost because a number of smaller services firms have mothballed equipment in response to a two-year rout in oil prices. Even Baker Hughes Inc, the world’s third-largest oilfield service firm, said in April it was limiting its exposure to the pressure pumping business in North America to two basins. Many firms have also stripped idle fracking gear for parts to repair the ones in use. Up to 4 million of horsepower, representing about a fifth of peak capacity has been permanently removed from the market, Halliburton’s Miller said on the call. Halliburton, however, preserved idle equipment, positioning the company to quickly get back to work. A near 70 percent jump in U.S. benchmark oil prices since February has brought oil producers back to the shale patch. Many shale producers are now completing previously-drilled-but-uncompleted wells, and some even drilling new wells. If a service firm were to re-activate cold-stacked equipment today, it would cost about $300,000, while replacing parts on cannibalized equipment may run into millions, said Evercore ISI analyst James West. The high costs are likely to keep cannibalized equipment off the market, giving Halliburton an advantage, West said. Schlumberger is scheduled to report quarterly results on Thursday.

430,HAL,Halliburton sees weak service pricing even as rig count rises,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the world’s No.2 oilfield services provider, said it expects a “modest uptick” in rig count in the second half of the year, but emphasized that the current low pricing environment was unsustainable. Shares of the company were down about 1.6 percent at $44.24 in morning trading on Wednesday. Shale oil companies have started putting rigs back to work, encouraged by a near 70 percent jump in U.S. benchmark oil prices CLc1 since February. “We believe the North America market has turned,” Chief Executive David Lesar said in a statement on Wednesday. But the rise in rig count has come without a corresponding jump in spending by oil and gas producers as increased productivity in the hydraulic fracturing process yields more barrels at lower cost. Lesar said on a post-earnings call that while some efficiency gains were sustainable and would continue, “deep, uneconomic pricing cuts” would have to be reversed. “Price negotiations have been a bar room brawl,” company President Jeffrey Miller said on the call. With signs of recovery, the company has walked away from money-losing jobs in recent months and has been reviewing every contract and program, down to individual wells, Miller said. “It’s a tough market, but we believe pricing will recover as activity increases.” The company expects margins in North America to improve by 100 to 200 basis points in the third quarter. Halliburton derives about 40 percent of its revenue from North America and is more exposed to the region than larger rival Schlumberger NV (SLB.N). Excluding a $3.5 billion fee Halliburton paid Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N for terminating a proposed acquisition and other items, loss from continuing operations was 14 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 30.  Analysts on average had expected a loss of 19 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Halliburton and Baker Hughes scrapped their deal - valued at about $35 billion when it was announced in November 2014 - in May after opposition from U.S. and European antitrust regulators. Net loss attributable to Halliburton was $3.21 billion, or $3.73 per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $54 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier.  Revenue fell 35 percent to $3.84 billion, but beat analysts’ average estimate of $3.75 billion. Schlumberger is scheduled to report its quarterly results on Thursday, while Baker Hughes will release its earnings on July 28.

Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] has built up more than $19 billion in debts to providers as it struggles with low oil prices and a decaying socialist economy, leading some leading service companies to slow operations.

433,HAL,UPDATE 2-Halliburton sees weak service pricing even as rig count rises,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the world’s No.2 oilfield services provider, said it expects a “modest uptick” in rig count in the second half of the year, but emphasized that the current low pricing environment was unsustainable. Shares of the company were down about 1.6 percent at $44.24 in morning trading on Wednesday. Shale oil companies have started putting rigs back to work, encouraged by a near 70 percent jump in U.S. benchmark oil prices CLc1 since February. “We believe the North America market has turned,” Chief Executive David Lesar said in a statement on Wednesday. But the rise in rig count has come without a corresponding jump in spending by oil and gas producers as increased productivity in the hydraulic fracturing process yields more barrels at lower cost. Lesar said on a post-earnings call that while some efficiency gains were sustainable and would continue, “deep, uneconomic pricing cuts” would have to be reversed. “Price negotiations have been a bar room brawl,” company President Jeffrey Miller said on the call. With signs of recovery, the company has walked away from money-losing jobs in recent months and has been reviewing every contract and program, down to individual wells, Miller said. “It’s a tough market, but we believe pricing will recover as activity increases.” The company expects margins in North America to improve by 100 to 200 basis points in the third quarter. Halliburton derives about 40 percent of its revenue from North America and is more exposed to the region than larger rival Schlumberger NV (SLB.N). Excluding a $3.5 billion fee Halliburton paid Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N for terminating a proposed acquisition and other items, loss from continuing operations was 14 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 30.  Analysts on average had expected a loss of 19 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Halliburton and Baker Hughes scrapped their deal - valued at about $35 billion when it was announced in November 2014 - in May after opposition from U.S. and European antitrust regulators. Net loss attributable to Halliburton was $3.21 billion, or $3.73 per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $54 million, or 6 cents per share, a year earlier.  Revenue fell 35 percent to $3.84 billion, but beat analysts’ average estimate of $3.75 billion. Schlumberger is scheduled to report its quarterly results on Thursday, while Baker Hughes will release its earnings on July 28.

436,HAL,Halliburton signals better demand for fracking equipment,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co indicated that demand for its fracking equipment was returning, despite the fewer number of rigs at work, as high-intensity shale drilling soaked up all the available capacity in the market. Halliburton is the world’s largest provider of equipment used in hydraulic fracturing or fracking - the process of pumping water and chemicals, known as proppants, into shale rocks to extract oil and gas. U.S. shale oil producers - Halliburton’s customers - are now drilling longer horizontal wells with multiple fracking stages, and deploying more horsepower and proppants to cover larger areas. This high-intensity drilling is boosting demand for fracking equipment. “Let me start today with a headline: 900 is the new 2,000 for U.S. rig activity,” the company’s president, Jeff Miller, said on a post-earnings call on Wednesday. “I believe it will only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market.” The company reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and said it expected a “modest uptick” in rig count in the second half of the year. The U.S. rig count climbed by 7 to 447 in the week ended July 15, but is far short of the 1,931 at work in September 2014. Demand for Halliburton and rival Schlumberger NV’s fracking equipment has also received a boost because a number of smaller services firms have mothballed equipment in response to a two-year rout in oil prices. Even Baker Hughes Inc, the world’s third-largest oilfield service firm, said in April it was limiting its exposure to the pressure pumping business in North America to two basins. Many firms have also stripped idle fracking gear for parts to repair the ones in use. Up to 4 million of horsepower, representing about a fifth of peak capacity has been permanently removed from the market, Halliburton’s Miller said on the call. Halliburton, however, preserved idle equipment, positioning the company to quickly get back to work. A near 70 percent jump in U.S. benchmark oil prices since February has brought oil producers back to the shale patch. Many shale producers are now completing previously-drilled-but-uncompleted wells, and some even drilling new wells. If a service firm were to re-activate cold-stacked equipment today, it would cost about $300,000, while replacing parts on cannibalized equipment may run into millions, said Evercore ISI analyst James West. The high costs are likely to keep cannibalized equipment off the market, giving Halliburton an advantage, West said. Schlumberger is scheduled to report quarterly results on Thursday.

437,HAL,Baker Hughes says North America recovery unlikely this year,"(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes Inc said it did not expect a substantial recovery in drilling and pricing in North America this year, in contrast with comments from bigger rivals Schlumberger Ltd and Halliburton Co. Baker Hughes’ shares, however, rose about 3 percent to $45.88 after the company said it expected margins to improve across its businesses due to recent job cuts and other restructuring actions. “I don’t subscribe to the hopeful commentary,” Baker Hughes Chief Executive Martin Craighead said on a post-earnings conference call on Thursday. Schlumberger said last week the oil downturn appeared to have bottomed out, while Halliburton said it expected a “modest uptick” in North American rig count in the second half of 2016.  “I believe oil prices in the upper $50s (per barrel) at a minimum are required for a sustainable recovery in North America,” Craighead said. Baker Hughes’ outlook was more “sanguine” than its peers’,  said Evercore ISI analyst James West, noting that oil prices have slid from last week, when Schlumberger and Halliburton reported results. Prices for both globally traded Brent futures and U.S. crude are down about 5 percent this week. In May, Baker Hughes and Halliburton scrapped their long-stalled deal - valued at about $35 billion when it was announced in 2014 - due to opposition from U.S. and European antitrust regulators. The companies had hoped the merger would help them weather the worst oil price crash in a generation. Baker Hughes said in May proceeds from a $3.5 billion breakup fee from Halliburton would fund a $1.5 billion share buyback and a $1 billion debt repayment. Baker Hughes, which expects to save an annualized $500 million in cost by the end of 2016, said it cut 3,000 jobs in the second quarter.  The company had laid off 2,000 employees in the first quarter and 18,000 last year. Baker Hughes had about 43,000 employees at the end of 2015. The company also said it was planning to launch new products this year, most of them for lowering costs and optimizing oil production. Net loss attributable to the company widened to $911 million, or $2.08 per share, in the quarter ended June 30. Excluding charges related to restructuring and asset writedown, the company reported a loss of 90 cents per share, bigger than the 62 cents analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 39.3 percent to $2.41 billion. ",7282016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-baker-hughes-results/baker-hughes-says-north-america-recovery-unlikely-this-year-idUSKCN1081C8

445,HAL,Trump adds antitrust expert to Justice transition team,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican antitrust veteran has been named on Monday to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team for the Justice Department, a choice that lawyers say signals a more hands-off approach to antitrust enforcement compared to Democratic President Barack Obama. David Higbee, a partner at the law firm Hunton & Williams LLP, worked for President George W. Bush’s administration from 2001 to 2005, spending the last year in the Antitrust Division. Since then he has advised clients on merger reviews, antitrust litigation and government investigations.  Higbee joins Joshua Wright, an economist and former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, as the only two people on Trump’s transition team with a background in antitrust. The Obama administration has challenged an unusually large number of mergers in the last few years, leading to the collapse of Halliburton Co’s plan to buy Baker Hughes Inc, among others. Currently, the Justice Department is suing Anthem Inc to prevent it from buying Cigna Corp and Aetna Inc to stop its purchase of Humana Inc. While Trump, who campaigned as a populist, has talked tough on media mergers such as AT&T; Inc buying Time Warner Inc, and singled out Amazon.com Inc for antitrust scrutiny, Higbee’s naming heralds a return to a traditional Republican view of merger enforcement, lawyers said. “Higbee will have that sensible caution,” said Bruce McDonald, another veteran of the Bush administration now at the law firm Jones Day. “He will be more confident in business and markets and less confident that government can identify and fix problems.” An antitrust division designed by Higbee would be tough on price-fixing and mergers of competitors but would be cautious in challenging deals where companies buy suppliers or incidents where companies are accused of breaking antitrust law to run competitors out of business, McDonald said.

446,HAL,Halliburton shareholder class action to settle for $100 million,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N) on Friday said it had reached a $100 million settlement to resolve a long-running securities fraud class action lawsuit against the oilfield services provider that twice reached the U.S. Supreme Court. The deal resolves a lawsuit in federal court in Dallas accusing Halliburton of misrepresenting its potential liability in asbestos litigation, its expected revenue from certain construction contracts and the benefits of a merger in 1998. Halliburton said the company itself would pay $54 million of the $100 million settlement, while its insurer would fund the rest. The deal, which would be subject to court approval, has no admission of liability, Halliburton said. David Boies, a lawyer for the lead plaintiff Erica P. John Fund Inc, in a statement welcomed the deal, which he said was a “significant monetary recovery for the class members in this hard fought, securities fraud class action.” The litigation has been pending for the Houston-based company since 2002, and came after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched a probe of Halliburton’s accounting for revenue on long-term construction projects. Halliburton, whose chief executive during the period in question was former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, settled that SEC case in 2004 for $7.5 million, but the class action litigation lived on for years to follow. The class action lawsuit accused Halliburton of misleading investors by understating asbestos liabilities, overstating construction and engineering revenue and inflating the benefits of a merger with Dresser Industries. The case twice reached the U.S. Supreme Court, most recently resulting in a ruling in 2014 that made it harder for investors to band together to pursue securities fraud lawsuits against publicly traded companies. In July 2015, U.S. District Judge Barbara Lynn certified the class of investors, but allowed them to pursue claims related to just one of six dates they said Halliburton made disclosures that corrected misleading statements. Halliburton subsequently appealed that ruling, and had been awaiting a decision prior to announcing Friday’s agreement in principle to settle the case. The case is Erica P John Fund Inc et al v. Halliburton Company et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 02-cv-01152.

448,HAL,Halliburton says North America revenue growth may beat rig count rise,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the world’s No. 2 oilfield services provider, said its revenue growth this year would meet or outpace the increase in the number of drilling rigs in North America. However, Halliburton’s revenue growth in North America in the latest quarter lagged the increase in rig count, sending the company’s shares down as much as 4.5 percent to $53.93. “They are really kind of throwing some cold water on North America pricing picking up in the first half of the year,” Barclays analyst David Anderson said. The company’s fourth-quarter revenue from North America increased 9 percent compared with the previous quarter, while the average U.S. rig count jumped 23 percent in the same period. “We expected a little more in terms of revenue growth just given what the rig count did,” Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai said. The reason for the difference was Halliburton’s decision to forgo unprofitable contracts, Chief Executive Dave Lesar said on a post-earnings call. That helped the company post its first quarterly operating profit in North America in a year and report an adjusted profit that topped analysts’ expectations. Rising oil prices are prompting producers to put more rigs back to work in low-cost shale fields in North America. “Animal spirits have broken free and they are running,” Lesar said. “Customers are excited again and our conversations have changed from being only about cost control to how we can meet their incremental demand.” To meet that demand, Lesar said Halliburton would start reviving hydraulic fracturing equipment it had idled when oil prices were slumping. However, Halliburton expects the reactivation costs to weigh on margins in the near term. Oil producers are more focused on North American shale fields than on expensive deepwater drilling and mature oilfields in international markets. Halliburton said there would not be an “inflection” in international markets until the latter half of 2017, echoing larger rival Schlumberger NV (SLB.N). “It is important to remember that our world is still a tale of two cycles,” Lesar said. “The North America market appears to have rounded the corner, but the international downward cycle is still playing out.” Net loss attributable to Halliburton rose more than five fold to $149 million in the latest quarter. Its adjusted profit of 4 cents per share was double analysts average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

461,HAL,Halliburton warns of first-quarter profit miss as costs rise,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the world’s No. 2 oilfield services provider, warned that its first-quarter profit would likely miss analysts’ expectations due to higher costs and weak demand in markets outside North America. Shares of the company, which forecast higher revenue from its U.S. land operations, were up about 1 percent in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company expects its earnings per share to be in low-single digits in the quarter ending March, Chief Executive David Lesar said on a conference call on Friday. Analysts on average expect earnings of 13 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The rise in costs is essentially because of the company’s move to reactivate more equipment and expand its headcount, in response to increased activity in shale fields across the United States. “By doubling this rate of activation and accelerating it to the front half of the year, we are in effect front loading much of the hit to income at the beginning of the year,” Lesar said.  Halliburton said it planned to hire over 2,000 field employees in its U.S. land operations by the end of the quarter. The company also said it was being impacted by higher costs for sand - used to keep wells open after fracking. U.S. shale producers have rapidly ramped up drilling over the past six months, encouraged by a near 50 percent rise in oil prices since February 2016, when they hit 13-year lows. Halliburton said it expected its first-quarter revenue from its U.S. land operation to surge by 25 percent from the fourth quarter. Activity in international markets in contrast remains sluggish, and an “inflection” is unlikely until later in the year, Lesar said.

464,HAL,U.S. energy stock options traders grow upbeat,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Traders in the equity options market are betting the U.S. energy sector is ripe for a bounce with one gauge of sentiment, options on the largest energy sector tracking fund, dipping to its least bearish position in six months. Recent trading in the options on the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund and individual energy company options, including Devon Energy Corp and Halliburton Co, highlights changing sentiment toward more investor optimism. “It looks like this week traders have started to position for upside in the energy sector,” said David Russell, senior manager at online broker E*Trade Financial Corp in Chicago. Buoyant oil prices since President Donald Trump’s election have not provided a boost for energy stocks as the sector’s profit rebound has lacked vigor. The S&P; energy index is down about 6.4 percent this year, making it the worst-performing  sector among S&P;’s tracking indexes. The broad benchmark S&P; 500 stock index, in contrast, is up 5.3 percent for the year. However, the recent climb in crude oil prices and upbeat expectations for the upcoming earnings season may be leading options traders to grow more bullish on the sector, analysts said. Through Wednesday, open put options on the Energy Select Sector fund outnumbered call options by a 1.34-to-1 margin, the lowest in six months, according to New York-based options analytics firm Trade Alert. In December, this measure of options market sentiment had soared to a bearish 2.57-to-1 margin, a 26-month high. Put options convey the right to sell shares at a fixed price in the future and are often used to protect against market declines. Calls, which convey the right to buy shares in the future, are usually used for bullish bets. Traders have also taken a liking to near-dated bullish options on Devon Energy, Halliburton and Schlumberger, said Fred Ruffy, analyst at Trade Alert.     Wall Street analysts expect a big rebound in energy earnings from a year ago, when S&P; 500 energy companies had a loss because of a sharp selloff in oil prices, according to Thomson Reuters data.

466,HAL,Halliburton gains from rising oil well completions in North America,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N) said on Monday that oil producers are completing nearly as many wells as they are drilling, a major reversal from when companies left wells unfinished in anticipation of higher oil prices. Increased demand for Halliburton’s pressure pumping and well-construction services helped the world’s No.2 oilfield services provider report slightly better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue.  Halliburton’s shares were up more than 1 percent at $47.72 in morning trade on Monday. “There’s no doubt that the pace of completions activity is catching up with the rig count, and we expect to see that relationship continue into next quarter, most certainly,” interim Chief Financial Officer Robb Voyles said on a post-earnings call. Halliburton’s long-time chief financial officer, Mark McCollum, is taking up the role of chief executive at smaller rival Weatherford International Plc (WFT.N). U.S. shale producers have been putting more rigs to work, buoyed by oil prices that have stabilized above $50 after a more than two-year slump. And since the fourth quarter of 2016, oil producers have also returned to complete wells they had left unfinished during the downturn on hopes of bringing them online when prices rose.   Halliburton said on Monday it expects revenue in its completion and production unit to increase in the upper teens in percentage terms in the second quarter, with margins expected to increase by 275-325 basis points.  The company’s revenue from North America rose 24.4 percent in the first quarter ended March 31. “North America activity increased rapidly during the first quarter, which was highlighted by our U.S. land revenue growth of nearly 30 percent, outperforming the sequential average U.S. land rig count growth of 27 percent,” Halliburton’s Chief Executive Dave Lesar said in a statement. However, Halliburton and larger rival Schlumberger (SLB.N) have been burdened by the costs associated with reactivating idled equipment to meet the increase in demand. Halliburton’s reactivation costs are expected to persist into the second quarter, President Jeffrey Miller said on the call.  The company on Monday posted an adjusted profit of 4 cents per share, edging past analysts’ average estimate of 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Analysts had sharply lowered their estimates after Halliburton warned last month of higher costs and weak demand in markets outside North America.

Lesar will stay on as executive chairman of the world’s second-largest oilfield service provider until December 2018, when he reaches the company’s mandatory retirement age of 65. The transition, which was expected, comes as Halliburton tries to recover from a two-year oil price downturn that has eroded profit margins and forced the company to lay off thousands of workers. Miller, 53, has a reputation inside Halliburton for working well with customers and employees, and for leading successful projects, according to former and current employees. Miller’s first task will be renegotiating contracts with oil producers, convincing them to pay more for Halliburton’s pressure pumping and other services.  The company, whose revenues plunged 33 percent last year to $15.9 billion, and its peers have warned since January that higher prices are needed to help provide the labor and parts needed to fuel the oil industry’s nascent recovery. Halliburton, with headquarters in Houston and Dubai, signaled last month that demand is rising, especially in North America’s shale oil patch. But the company has yet to be able to raise costs measurably, denting profit. “I look forward to leading our organization as we continue to collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize asset value for our customers,” Miller said in a statement.  Lesar, who became CEO after predecessor Dick Cheney was nominated to be U.S. vice president in 2000, will step back from day-to-day company management but still be involved in talks with customers and shareholders.  Lesar signed a new employment contract with the company through the end of next year that will prohibit him from working for peers for another four-year period. “I have known and worked with Jeff for almost 30 years and have great confidence that he is the best choice to be the next Halliburton CEO,” Lesar said in a statement.

He assumes the top role after Halliburton lost its long-time chief financial officer, Mark McCollum, who left in March to become CEO at rival Weatherford International Plc (WFT.N). Lesar’s unusually long tenure at the company was marked by growth but also controversy. The company came under withering criticism for its flawed work on BP’s (BP.L) Deepwater Horizon drilling rig before it exploded in 2010, causing the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

The rising business activity comes as Jeff Miller prepares to become the 98-year-old company’s chief executive officer next month, taking over from Dave Lesar, CEO since 2000. “We will continue to implement our strategy,” Miller said in an interview at the company’s Houston headquarters just outside George Bush Intercontinental Airport. “North America is absolutely our growth story today.” Miller, Lesar and other executives have been in talks with customers for months about raising rates for Halliburton’s myriad services, highlighting not only the company’s scale but its experience.  Halliburton was the first company to hydraulically fracture, or frack, a well, pioneering the process in 1949.  Many customers had locked in service rates during the two-year price downturn when Halliburton laid off more than 35,000 employees. Today, with the American shale oil industry whirring again, Halliburton is at max capacity for many services and itching to charge more.  Like peers, Halliburton has said it will not refurbish old equipment for field use until prices rise and has no North American fracking crews available until at least the fall. That limits the ability of customers to bring new wells online. “Customer urgency is the most-important part of that discussion today,” said Miller, an accountant by training. Lesar, who will retire as CEO but remain executive chairman until Dec. 2018, echoed those comments in an interview, adding that Halliburton is keen to work with producers to prevent rampant cost inflation. “We and our customers have to co-exist in this environment,” said Lesar, who became CEO after predecessor Dick Cheney was nominated to be U.S. vice president. “Everybody has got to make money.” Shares of Halliburton, which have lost about 14 percent this year, rose 24 cents, or 0.5 percent, on Thursday to close at $46.58.  Both executives expect oil prices CLc1 to remain near $50 per barrel for the foreseeable future, a level they believe will allow North American shale customers and Halliburton to grow in tandem. “Clearly, the rising star at this point in time is the Permian” shale basin of Texas and New Mexico, Lesar said, adding that the DJ Basin in Colorado and the Utica in Ohio are other shale areas where Halliburton is growing. Costs for sand used in fracking pressured Halliburton over the winter, since many mines are located in the northern United States. Still, both executives said they believe their supply costs should stabilize this year. Halliburton has hired more than 2,000 workers since the oil industry started to recover, more than half of them former employees. That points to the company’s lucrative salary and perks, as well as its culture, both executives said. “We’ve got a very loyal workforce,” Miller said. One role the company must soon fill is finance chief, after Mark McCollum left earlier this year to become CEO of rival Weatherford International Plc (WFT.N). “We have got some really good candidates for CFO,” Lesar said. “We can take the luxury of time to find the absolute best fit.” As Lesar hands the reins to Miller, Halliburton faces a re-energized competitive landscape. Rival Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N is set to merge later this year with General Electric Co’s (GE.N) oil and gas division, which is located right next door to Halliburton’s headquarters. It is a tense tie-up for Halliburton after it failed to buy Baker itself last year and had to pay a $3.5 billion breakup fee. “Our position in North America is second-to-none,” Lesar said. “We intend to hold that, no matter what the competition does.” ",5182017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-halliburton-executives-growth/halliburtons-incoming-ceo-sees-significant-price-hike-idUSKCN18E2Q4

Many customers had locked in service rates during the two-year price downturn when Halliburton laid off more than 35,000 employees. Today, with the American shale oil industry whirring again, Halliburton is at max capacity for many services and itching to charge more. Like peers, Halliburton has said it will not refurbish old equipment for field use until prices rise and has no North American fracking crews available until at least the fall. That limits the ability of customers to bring new wells online. “Customer urgency is the most-important part of that discussion today,” said Miller, an accountant by training. Lesar, who will retire as CEO but remain executive chairman until Dec. 2018, echoed those comments in an interview, adding that Halliburton is keen to work with producers to prevent rampant cost inflation. “We and our customers have to co-exist in this environment,” said Lesar, who became CEO after predecessor Dick Cheney was nominated to be U.S. vice president. “Everybody has got to make money.” Both executives expect oil prices to remain near $50 per barrel for the foreseeable future, a level they believe will allow North American shale customers and Halliburton to grow in tandem. “Clearly, the rising star at this point in time is the Permian” shale basin of Texas and New Mexico, Lesar said, adding that the DJ Basin in Colorado and the Utica in Ohio are other shale areas where Halliburton is growing. Costs for sand used in fracking pressured Halliburton over the winter, since many mines are located in the northern United States. Still, both executives said they believe their supply costs should stabilize this year. Halliburton has hired more than 2,000 workers since the oil industry started to recover, more than half of them former employees. That points to the company’s lucrative salary and perks, as well as its culture, both executives said. “We’ve got a very loyal workforce,” Miller said. One role the company must soon fill is finance chief, after Mark McCollum left earlier this year to become CEO of rival Weatherford International Plc. “We have got some really good candidates for CFO,” Lesar said. “We can take the luxury of time to find the absolute best fit.” As Lesar hands the reins to Miller, Halliburton faces a re-energized competitive landscape. Rival Baker Hughes Inc is set to merge later this year with General Electric Co’s oil and gas division, which is located right next door to Halliburton’s headquarters. It is a tense tie-up for Halliburton after it failed to buy Baker itself last year and had to pay a $3.5 billion breakup fee. “Our position in North America is second-to-none,” Lesar said. “We intend to hold that, no matter what the competition does.” (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by David Gregorio)",5182017,http://www.reuters.com/article/halliburton-executives-growth/rpt-update-1-halliburtons-incoming-ceo-sees-price-hike-above-10-pct-idUSL2N1IK1SH

While that increase will be more many customers would like, Halliburton said it needs to charge more if it its to provide the services needed fuel the industry’s nascent recovery, “Pricing momentum continues to move in a positive manner,” Jeff Miller, who will become the company’s chief executive next month, said in an interview. “Customer urgency is the most-important part of that discussion today.” Prices for pressure pumping and other services won’t jump, though, as in the last industry boom, outgoing CEO Dave Lesar added. “We and our customers have to co-exist in this environment,” said Lesar, who will remain executive chairman. “Everybody has got to make money.” Halliburton announced the leadership transition on Wednesday night.

482,HAL,UPDATE 1-Halliburton buys Summit ESP to strengthen artificial lift business,"(Adds details about deal, comment from analyst note, context) By Liz Hampton July 5 (Reuters) - Halliburton Co said on Wednesday it has acquired oilfield equipment supplier Summit ESP Inc, a move that helps the third largest oilfield services company by revenue enhance its presence in the artificial lift business. Tulsa, Oklahoma-based Summit ESP, which is backed by Oklahoma energy and banking billionaire George Kaiser, makes electric submersible pumps used to maintain well pressure to increase oil and gas production in aging wells. The devices, components in a business called artificial lift, increasingly are being used to prolong the life of shale wells. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. The transaction closed on Monday, Halliburton spokeswoman Emily Mir said on Wednesday. Halliburton said it will fold Summit into its existing artificial lift business. Summit Chief Executive John Kenner will become senior director of Halliburton’s ESP and Horizontal Pumping Systems (HSP) unit, reporting to Greg Schneider, Halliburton’s vice president of artificial lift business, according to Mir. Summit, which will keep its offices in Tulsa, was founded in 2011 and is led by executives including Kenner, who earlier held senior posts at Baker Hughes. Summit had revenue of about $180 million last year, according to researcher Spears & Associates. Reuters reported in June that Halliburton was in late-stage talks to acquire Summit. While the acquisition gives Halliburton a stronger foothold in the artificial lift business, the company will still lack a dominant market position compared with competitors Schlumberger NV and Baker Hughes, a General Electric Co firm. “The company may not be done expanding there,” energy investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt said in a note on Wednesday. Artificial lift is an approximately $12 billion-a-year global business, according to market researcher Frost & Sullivan, and dominated by Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and Weatherford International PLC. Electric submersible pumps are an about $5 billion-a-year part of that, it estimates. Halliburton had been the second largest oilfield services company behind Schlumberger, but fell to third following the closing of a merger between Baker Hughes and GE Oil and Gas this week. Summit has expanded its business quickly in the United States and Canada as drillers seek to pump more oil from shale wells, which have a faster rate of production decline than conventional wells. In May announced it had installed its 8,000th electric submersible pump (ESP), an increase of 1,000 since November.

486,HAL,Unsustainable oil services demand to hit U.S. shale boom: Halliburton,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - The U.S. shale drilling boom is likely to ease next year as demand on the industry’s service sector is unsustainable, Halliburton’s (HAL.N) business development head said on Tuesday. The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States rose to 763 last week, the highest in more than two years, showing that despite oil trading below $50 a barrel, shale oil explorers are still ramping up activity. Halliburton’s Mark Richard, senior vice president for global business development and marketing, sees that count rising above 1,000 by the end of the year, but not beyond that. “I think it might level off then. If our customers put too much out there, it’s costing too much and putting too much demand on service companies to provide equipment and people,” he told Reuters at an industry event in Istanbul. Oil services companies cut back dramatically when demand for their products fell oil prices started falling in 2014 and it has taken them longer to readjust their output. Richard said he sees 800-900 rigs as a more sustainable level in the medium term. The increase in shale activity has been a boon for companies like Halliburton which supply equipment to the sector and Richard said he had been able to raise prices in the U.S. because of rising demand, but declined to give details. However, appetite for oil and gas equipment is still weak outside of the Americas, Richard said. “We’ve hit the bottom in the first half of this year. Our customers are getting excited about things but we don’t yet see a lot of activity increasing.” Richard denied Halliburton was under additional pressure following the acquisition of rival Baker Hughes, which it failed to buy last year after regulatory opposition, by GE Oil & Gas last week. GE-Baker Hughes (BHGE.N) will leapfrog Halliburton to become  the world’s second-biggest oil services company after Schlumberger (SLB.N). “We’re number 1 or 2 in every product line we work in today. That hasn’t changed because GE bought Baker,” he said  ",7112017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-halliburton-shale-drilling/unsustainable-oil-services-demand-to-hit-u-s-shale-boom-halliburton-idUSKBN19W1BN

488,HAL,Oil rises 1 percent after Saudi vows to cap crude exports next month,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose more than 1 percent on Monday, after leading OPEC producer Saudi Arabia pledged to cut exports in August to help reduce the global crude glut, and Halliburton Co’s (HAL.N) executive chairman said the U.S. shale drilling boom would probably ease next year. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said his country would limit crude oil exports at 6.6 million barrels per day in August, almost 1 million bpd below levels a year ago. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak also told reporters that an additional 200,000 bpd could be removed from the market if compliance with a global deal to cut output was 100 percent. Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up 54 cents or 1.1 percent to $48.60 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled up 57 cents or about 1.3 percent to $46.34 a barrel. The Saudi and Russian energy ministers were in St. Petersburg for a gathering of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers. Ministers discussed their previous agreement to cut production 1.8 million bpd from January 2017 through March 2018. Falih said OPEC and non-OPEC partners were committed to cut output longer if necessary but would demand that non-compliant nations stick to the agreement. OPEC members Nigeria and Libya have been exempt from the output cuts, and market watchers remain concerned that production from the two countries is offsetting the impact of the global reduction. There was no discussion of deeper output cuts, and OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said Nigeria had no intention of going beyond its production target of 1.8 million bpd. Libya’s oil production has reached 1.069 million barrels per day, a Libyan oil source told Reuters, above a high reached earlier this month. In the United States, rig counts were up to 764 in the latest week, from 371 rigs a year ago. The executive chairman of energy services company Halliburton said he expected a U.S. rig count above 1,000 by year end, but that about 800 to 900 rigs was more sustainable in the medium term. “Today, rig count growth is showing signs of plateauing, and customers are tapping the brakes,” said Dave Lesar. “This tapping of the brakes is happening all over the place in North America.” Still, oil prices remain under pressure, said Tony Headrick, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging LLC in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota. “The upside is limited because as we move towards $50 that gives U.S. producers an incentive to hedge for future production,” he said. “It all leads to a neutral market, give or take $40-$45 dollars per barrel.” ",7242017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil/oil-rises-1-percent-after-saudi-vows-to-cap-crude-exports-next-month-idUSKBN1A80YF

Oilfield services providers such as Halliburton have been helped by a boom in North American drilling even though oil has stayed below $50.

The company’s revenue from North America surged 83 percent to $2.77 billion in the second quarter, due to increased demand for pumping and well-construction services in the region.  Halliburton said margins in its biggest market by sales grew “into double digits” in the quarter and CEO Jeff Miller expected margins from the region to improve.

Shares of the world’s largest construction and mining equipment maker rose as much as 5.4 percent on Tuesday to touch a more than five-year high. Caterpillar’s strong results are the clearest indication yet that the company is turning a corner after weak commodity prices and global economic uncertainty hit demand for its iconic yellow earth-moving equipment in the past few years. JPMorgan Securities analyst Ann Duignan called the results a solid “beat and raise” even as expectations were high coming into the quarter. Sales rose at all three of the company’s main businesses, with the resource industries unit, which makes mining equipment, reporting the biggest jump compared with a year earlier. While acknowledging that markets remain challenged, Chief Executive Jim Umpleby said “construction in China and gas compression in North America were highlights in the quarter.” Total sales rose 9.6 percent to $11.33 billion and handily beat analysts’ average estimate of $10.93 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales from Asia Pacific, Caterpillar’s third-biggest market, jumped 23 percent in the quarter, boosted by an increase in construction equipment sales in China. Demand for construction equipment in China is gaining momentum after bottoming out last year, driven by a Beijing-backed infrastructure push, a housing boom and increased investment linked to China’s modern-day “Silk Road”. Sales in North America, Caterpillar’s biggest market, were up 7 percent, largely due to improving demand from the mining and energy industries as commodity prices increase. Most of the demand in the oil and gas business came as rigs got back to work, but Caterpillar cautioned that prices would need to stabilize at “these higher levels” to drive long-term demand for equipment. The number of operational rigs in North America has more than doubled from its lows last year. But oilfield services providers such as Halliburton Co (HAL.N) have warned that growth in rig count was showing signs of plateauing.    Caterpillar said it now expects 2017 adjusted earnings of about $5 per share, up from the $3.75 it had previously forecast. The company lifted its full-year sales and revenue forecast to a range of $42 billion to $44 billion, from its previous forecast of $38 billion to $41 billion. Net income rose about 46 percent to $802 million. Excluding items, Caterpillar earned $1.49 per share, handsomely beating the average estimate of $1.26 per share. Caterpillar's shares were up 5.1 percent at $113.70. Up to Monday's close the stock had gained 16.6 percent this year, outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average's .DJI 9 percent rise.

496,HAL,"Halliburton, Schlumberger take hit on Venezuela bills in second quarter"," ((This July 25 story corrects to indicate majority of the impairment charged was related to PdVSA’s promissory notes, not all of the charge, in second paragraph)) By Liz Hampton HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela was unable to pay its biggest oilfield suppliers in cash in the second quarter, and top service companies Halliburton and Schlumberger accepted promissory notes that they immediately wrote down by hundreds of millions of dollars, their second-quarter reports showed.   Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield service firm by revenue, took a $510 million impairment charge, the vast majority of which was on promissory notes received from Petroleos de Venezuela SA [PDVSAC.UL] in lieu of $700 million in outstanding fees.  Halliburton similarly recorded a pre-tax charge of $262 million on promissory notes from its main customer in Venezuela in exchange for $375 million in fees, according to its financial filing.  Neither company identified PDVSA by name, and both described the oil company as their “primary customer” in Venezuela. A PDVSA source confirmed it issued the notes.  Foreign oil companies operating in Venezuela have become increasingly exposed to that country’s economic woes, which have worsened under socialist President Nicolas Maduro. A brutal recession and persistent low oil prices have the cash-strapped nation delaying payments or using government-issued notes to pay suppliers. Last month, Weatherford International plc said it would amend its financial statements to reclassify $31 million that was previously booked as revenue as interest payment and a reduction in accounts receivable because of PDVSA’s lengthy delay in payment.   Representatives from Halliburton and Weatherford did not immediately respond to requests for comments. Schlumberger referred questions on the impairment charge to its coming financial filings. Such problems have not stopped smaller firms for signing up for work in the country. Oklahoma-based Horizontal Well Drillers on Tuesday said it signed a memorandum of understanding to explore new drilling jobs for PDVSA in Venezuela.  Last year, the company, Schlumberger and Venezuelan contractor Y&V; agreed to drill a combined 480 wells for projects operated by PDVSA and its foreign partners, but that project has not yet started. The United States has been weighing financial sanctions against Venezuela that could halt dollar payments for its oil, Reuters reported last week, a move to pressure Maduro into halting plans for a new Constituent Assembly that would give him unchecked power.  If sanctions were to pass, payments to oilfield service firms could become even more challenging.

497,HAL,Halliburton to pay $29.2 mln to settle U.S. charges tied to Angola,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Oil company Halliburton Co will pay $29.2 million to settle civil charges it violated federal anti-bribery rules related to books, record-keeping and internal accounting controls while doing business in Angola, U.S. regulators said on Thursday. The Securities and Exchange Commission said Halliburton’s former vice president, Jeannot Lorenz, separately agreed to pay a $75,000 penalty in connection with the alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Both the company and Lorenz are settling the case without admitting or denying the allegations. In a statement, Halliburton said the Justice Department had also investigated the matter and was planning to close it out without filing related criminal charges. The probe began after the company received an anonymous allegation about possible FCPA violations in December 2010. The company said it “promptly” reported the tip about possible corruption to the Justice Department, conducted its own internal investigation and cooperated with the government. A lawyer for Lorenz could not immediately be reached for comment. The SEC said the alleged FCPA violations stemmed from contracts that Halliburton entered into with a local Angolan company in order to satisfy certain “local content regulations” for foreign firms doing business in the country. Some of those payments, the SEC said, “were made in advance of Halliburton obtaining lucrative oilfield service contracts.”",7272017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-sec-halliburton/halliburton-to-pay-29-2-mln-to-settle-u-s-charges-tied-to-angola-idUSL1N1KI1EX

501,HAL,"UPDATE 3-Chesapeake to cut rig count, bring fewer wells to production","(Reuters) - U.S. natural gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corp beat quarterly profit estimates, but said it planned to cut its rig count and bring fewer wells into production this year.  The company, which operates in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, the Utica Shale in Ohio and the Anadarko Basin in northwestern Oklahoma among others, said it would run 14 rigs by the end of 2017, down from 18 rigs now. “We suspect Chesapeake may cut back activity in the relatively gassy North Eastern Appalachia, Haynesville and (to a lesser extent) Midcontinent regions,” Barclays analysts wrote in a note. Last month, oilfield services provider Halliburton Co warned growth in North American rig count was “showing signs of plateauing”. U.S. energy companies added 10 rigs in July, the fewest in  any month since May 2016. Oil prices have fallen 7.3 percent so far this year, slowing the pace of a 14-month drilling recovery. Chesapeake said it expected to bring about 250 wells to sale in the second half of 2017 - 10 less than it had earlier projected. The company may also deploy less capital to rigs in 2018, while spending more on other assets, CEO Doug Lawler said.  Like many other oil producers, Chesapeake is working toward reducing expenses, while using new technology to improve production. “We expect to exceed our goal of 100,000 barrels of oil per day prior to (the) year-end,” CEO Doug Lawler said. The company had earlier expected to just hit the target. The company produced about 88,400 barrels of oil per day in the quarter, up 6 percent from the preceding quarter. Excluding items, the company earned 18 cents per share in the reported quarter, higher than analysts’ expectation of 14 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue for the Oklahoma City-based company jumped 41 percent to $2.28 billion.  Separately, Chesapeake said the U.S. Department of Justice was closing its investigation into its accounting methodology.  Shares of the company fell as much as 2.5 percent to $4.50 in late morning trading on Thursday.

502,HAL,Pullback in U.S. fracking sand use pressures producers,"(Reuters) - U.S. shale oil companies are pulling back on the amount of sand they use to hydraulically fracture new wells, responding to rising prices of the material that are driving up costs. Investors worry a slowdown in sand use, combined with new mining capacity coming online, could lead to a glut of the material and bring down prices. The worries have pressured shares of sand companies.  Sand prices soared in the last year as oil companies ramped up shale drilling and production. But with crude LCoC1CLC1 prices below where they started the year, oil producers are employing new well designs and chemical agents that lessen the use of sand that represents around 12 percent of the cost of drilling and fracturing. The price of frack sand is expected to rise 62 percent this year to average $47 a ton, according to researcher IHS Markit. That is expected to drive oilfield service price inflation to 15 percent over 2016, according to researchers at Wood Mackenzie.   Oilfield services provider Halliburton Co (HAL.N), which buys sand for its drilling customers, last month reported its first decline in average sand used per well, saying customers wanted designs that consumed less of the material. Average sand volumes for each foot of a well drilled fell slightly last quarter for the first time in a year, said exploration and production consultancy Rystad Energy. Volumes are expected to drop a further 2.5 percent per foot in the current quarter over last, Rystad forecast. “As alternative strategies are optimized, sand density will fall on a foot by foot basis – dramatically in time,” said Dallas Salazar, chief executive of energy consulting firm Atlas Consulting. For a graphic showing frack sand use per well over time, see: tmsnrt.rs/2fHzJbc Frack sand is mixed in a slurry and forced at high pressure into wells to free oil and gas trapped in rocks. Any weakening of sand demand would collide with several sand producers’ plans to open new mines.  Companies including Unimin Corp, U.S. Silica Holdings Inc (SLCA.N), and Hi Crush Partners LP (HCLP.N) are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on new mines to address an expected increase in demand. On Thursday, supplier Smart Sand SND.O reported it shipped less frack sand in the second quarter than it did in the first. Rival Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc (FMSA.N) forecast flat to slightly higher volumes this quarter over last. In the last six weeks, shares of U.S. Silica and Hi Crush are both off about 30 percent. Smart Sand is off about 43 percent since June 30.  Some shale producers add chemical diverters, compounds that spread the slurry evenly in a well, and can reduce the amount of sand required. Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) and Continental Resources Inc (CLR.N) are reducing the distance between fractures to boost oil production. The tighter spacing allows them to extract more crude with less sand.  In the Denver-Julesburg Basin of Colorado, Anadarko said the new well designs have increased oil and gas production by as much as 35 percent. It is “no secret we have experimented with less sand out there,” Bradley Holly, Anadarko’s head of U.S. onshore exploration and production, told analysts last month.  Analysts and frack sand providers continue to forecast an overall rise in sand consumption as more wells are drilled and completed. Smart Sand last week blamed its decline on operational and logistics problems. “The cases where people were scaling back [sand] usage, that was probably due to logistics problems,” Duane Scardino, Hi Crush’s corporate development manager, said in an interview this week. “It’s hard for me to imagine what would be more cost effective than frack sand.”  Still, Atlas Consulting’s Salazar said of the major U.S. shale basins, only two - Haynesville and Eagle Ford - are pumping in more sand per well.

505,HAL,Most U.S. oil executives see prices below $60/barrel through 2018,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Nearly two-thirds of U.S. oil executives see crude oil prices remaining below $60 per barrel through 2018 and not hitting $70 until at least the next decade, according to a survey published on Wednesday by consultancy Deloitte Services LP [DLTE.UL]. The survey, based on a poll of 250 executives at companies that produce, transport and refine oil and natural gas, reflects a shift from last year when many respondents forecast commodity prices would rise and capital spending budgets grow. U.S. oil prices CLc1 fell slightly on Wednesday to $50.79 per barrel.  This year’s more dour view, especially among shale industry managers, comes as executives are focusing on cost controls and returns and have largely stopped looking for a rise in commodity prices. This new paradigm is encouraging shale producers to base executive compensation on the best uses of capital, a strategy designed to keep costs low. “The bottom line is that companies should focus on cost discipline and operational efficiency,” said Andrew Slaughter, head of Deloitte’s Center for Energy Solutions. “The new reality seems to have set in; waiting for a significant price recovery may be a long haul.” Half of executives polled said they expect capital spending to drop next year, and nearly 60 percent said they expect a decline in the number of drilling rigs active across the United States. Production in the shale industry requires constant investment to keep up with well decline rates. Those polled said they expect to maintain or increase current production levels into 2018, though a drop in spending could prevent any sizable increase in U.S. output, helping to resolve a global supply and demand imbalance. That would fit well into a plan by the 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which on Wednesday forecast higher demand for its oil in 2018 and a worldwide supply deficit. In a wary sign for oilfield service providers, including Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes, (BHGE.N), roughly half of those surveyed by Deloitte expect service costs to slip next year. Greater well efficiency and new technologies - long touted by industry executives as a cure-all for low prices - were seen as having less of an impact on costs.     The mood among executives was less pessimistic for natural gas prices NGc1, with those polled saying they expect prices to rise above $3 per million British thermal units into next year. Natural gas futures NGc1 rose 1.5 percent on Wednesday to $2.93 per mmBtu.

506,HAL,Halliburton warns of slower growth as U.S. rig count drops,"(Reuters) - Oilfield services giant Halliburton Co (HAL.N) on Monday warned of slower growth at its oil well drilling and evaluation business, reflecting a steady drop in rig counts in the United States. The outlook suggests Halliburton’s current-quarter might not be as strong as its latest quarter, echoing warnings on Friday from its two bigger rivals, Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) and Baker Hughes (BHGE.N). Halliburton’s shares fell about 1.5 percent. Schlumberger was down 1.5 percent, while Baker Hughes fell 4 percent. North American revenue from Halliburton’s drilling and evaluation business is likely to fall in step with the average U.S. rig count in the fourth quarter, Chief Financial Officer Christopher Weber said on a conference call. The company’s drilling and evaluation business posted a 15 percent rise in revenue in the third quarter. After a strong start to the year, the average rig count in the United States has fallen in 10 of the past 12 weeks, soon after U.S. oil producers, including Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N), cut their budgets for the year. U.S. oil producers are under pressure to boost shareholder returns after ramping up spending earlier this year, while crude oil prices remained flat. “(Halliburton’s) commentary about rig counts driving near term growth creates some level of uncertainty regarding whether they will be able to meet Q4 estimates,” said Brian Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones. Halliburton, the market leader in the fracking industry, also reported lower-than-expected margins for the third quarter in its completion and production (C&P;) business, its biggest.

Oil accounts for over 90 percent of the nation’s export revenues.  Socialist President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday said the country plans to potentially restructure some $60 billion in bonds, widely seen as signaling a possible default that could affect other debt. New York-based investment firm Torino Capital estimates that, in addition to the bonds, Venezuela owes some $26 billion to creditors and $24 billion in commercial loans.  Oil services firms must now balance the prospect of future work in the OPEC-member South American nation against the risk of write-offs. Several have had to sharply write down the value of promissory notes received for past work in Venezuela. Suppliers with overdue bills linked to the nation include oilfield services companies, storage facility operators, and shipping firms. All play key roles in keeping its oil flowing to world markets.  U.S.-based oilfield services provider Halliburton Co has a $727 million investment in Venezuela, including $429 million in outstanding bills, according to its most recent financial report. Schlumberger has about $700 million at risk, including receivables and a promissory note for past work. Weatherford International has at least $158 million in outstanding bills, and Baker Hughes holds receivables and inventory valued at $100 million, according to their most recent financial reports. PDVSA’s [PDVSA.UL] late payments for time-chartered tankers have grown in recent months as it put commitments to bondholders ahead of suppliers, according to shippers and a PDVSA source. The company is also losing other service providers over the lack of timely payments. PDVSA could not be reached for comment. Reduced access to infrastructure for blending and shipping oil in large tankers from the Caribbean has contributed to PDVSA’s declining crude exports, which fell to 1.47 million barrels per day (bpd) in the third quarter, 9.7 percent lower from the same period of 2016, according to Reuters data. “They have sacrificed the company’s operations to pay bondholders,” the PDVSA source said.  After taking promissory notes from Venezuela earlier this year in exchange for $375 million in earlier debts, Halliburton wrote off $262 million of the notes. It is no longer seeking new work in the country, a source close to the matter said.  “We do not intend to accept further notes as payment if offered,” the company said in a regulatory filing last month.  A Halliburton spokeswoman declined to make an executive available to comment and declined to comment on the possibility of further write-downs. Baker Hughes confirmed the book value of its outstanding debts but declined further comment. Weatherford and Schlumberger did not respond to requests for comment. Shipping firms since last year have intermittently retained loaded oil cargoes as a way to pressure PDVSA for payment. The situation created bottlenecks to finding vessels for exports and domestic transportation, limiting shipments of Venezuelan oil. Wait times for tankers that bring refined products and petroleum to Venezuela have extended in recent months to as much as 120 days, signaling slower payment, according to trade sources and Reuters data.  In total, there are 12 vessels carrying components of gasoline, naphtha and other products waiting since at least October to discharge, according to Reuters vessel tracking data.

518,HAL,Halliburton upbeat on 2018 as oil recovery spreads,"(Reuters) - U.S. oilfield services company Halliburton Co (HAL.N) reported  a bigger-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit on Monday and gave an upbeat outlook for 2018, as higher oil prices continue to push U.S. production to near-record levels. Halliburton’s optimistic view for its U.S. and international operations comes as rising crude prices spur demand for oilfield services. Its results, along with those of larger rival Schlumberger (SLB.N), suggested the oil and gas recovery will spread beyond U.S. onshore to international exploration and production markets.   “I am very excited about the way 2018 is shaping up,” said Chief Executive Jeff Miller during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. “North American unconventional activity should be very busy,” he added, referring to growth in production from U.S. shale.  Halliburton’s shares were up more than 5 percent at $55.71 in midday trading.  The company took a fourth-quarter charge of $385 million for its operations in Venezuela, which has been mired in political and economic turmoil. Halliburton said it would continue to “vigorously pursue” payments from its primary customer there, but expects continuing delays in payments. Schlumberger last week reported a $938 million write-down on its Venezuelan assets and receivables. Other oilfield services firms have taken charges recently from receivables and promissory notes exchanged for debts from state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela PDVSA.UL.  The company posted an adjusted profit of 53 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate of 46 cents per share, as per Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  “The big takeaway is that they conveyed an unequivocally constructive outlook for the industry in 2018,” said Bill Herbert, research analyst with Simmons & Company. He pointed to the company’s expectation that its North American margins will climb to around 20 percent this year. Margins were in the mid-teens in 2017, he said.  The company was upbeat about the health of the U.S. oil industry given the rise in oil prices and increased drilling. The U.S. rig count is up almost 35 percent from last year, according to data from General Electric’s Baker Hughes (BHGE.N) “Commodity prices are supportive of increasing activity in North America and I am encouraged by the increase in tender activity and the positive discussions we are having with our international customers,” Miller said in a statement. Halliburton, which makes more than half its revenue from North American operations, said total revenue rose to $5.9 billion for the quarter, from $4.02 billion a year earlier. Revenue in North America was $3.4 billion, up from $1.8 billion. The uptick in U.S. drilling activity drove up costs for sand and trucking during the quarter, the company said on its call, but sand costs should decline in 2018 as local mines come online.  The company also reported $882 million in tax charges, largely the result of preliminary tax provisions related to the new U.S. tax law passed in December. Schlumberger on Friday beat Wall Street forecasts and predicted its international operations would grow in 2018 for the first time in four years. A stronger outlook for the international market follows a nearly 24 percent climb in the global Brent futures contract LCOc1 in the past three months. “As for the international market, I’m encouraged for the first time in three years,” said Miller.

523,HAL,Frack sand delays to hurt Halliburton first-quarter earnings,"(Reuters) - U.S. oilfield services company Halliburton Co’s (HAL.N) first-quarter earnings will be reduced by 10 cents per share due to delays in deliveries of sand used in fracking, Chief Financial Officer Christopher Weber said on Thursday. Halliburton’s shares fell 2.5 percent after Weber’s comments during a webcast presentation at the Credit Suisse Energy Summit. Shale drillers blast sand and water into wells to release trapped gas and oil inside the earth. Sand is the most sought-after proppant used in fracking. “We got multiple sand operators whose operations in the region were impacted and from which we purchase about one-third of our total sand volumes,” Weber said, adding that the delays would have an impact on Halliburton’s operating efficiencies and utilization. The company has been facing delays of up to 72 hours since February, Weber said. Most other pressure pumpers will likely see similar headwinds, further hampered by the cold weather Texas experienced in January, said Evercore ISI analyst James West in a note. West believes the impact will be limited to the first quarter and said earnings should return to normal as the company exits the quarter. Tudor Pickering analyst Byron Pope, however, said the delays would not affect other oilfield services companies. “This feels to me as though it’s more of a Halliburton-specific issue.” The company is expected to report first-quarter results in April.

527,HAL,Permian producers can halve sand costs through local sourcing-report,"(Reuters) - Oil producers in the Permian basin could save 40-50 percent on frack sand costs by sourcing it from local basins, market research consultancy Energent said on Thursday. Sand, used to hold open tiny cracks in shale rocks in order to allow oil and gas to escape, is the most widely used proppant for hydraulic fracking. So far, the industry has relied upon frack sand hauled over 1,200 miles from Wisconsin at a cost of $110 per ton, Energent, which is a part of market research firm Westwood Global Energy Group, said. By the end of 2018, Energent expects over seven million tons of premium frack sand to be mined inside the Permian Basin every quarter. That can result in potential savings of $500,000 per well, and cut back dependency on sand-by-rail by 800,000 tons in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to the first quarter, Houston-based Energent said. Last year, sand miners including Unimin Corp, U.S. Silica Holdings Inc and Hi Crush Partners LP spent hundreds of millions of dollars on new mines to address a surge in demand from the Permian. “It (local sourcing) will also focus attention on logistics within the basin itself ... which will also drive well economics,” Energent founder Todd Bush said. Apart from costs, hauling sand over large distances bring other logistical challenges. A severe winter has disrupted rail lines in recent quarters, delaying deliveries of sand from the U.S. Mid West and Canada. No.3 U.S. oilfield services provider Halliburton Co and sand miner Fairmount Santrol Holdings have said they expect rail delays of sand deliveries to affect their quarterly results.

528,HAL,"ProPetro Holding profit misses, shares fall","HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shares of ProPetro Holding Corp (PUMP.N) fell by as much as 12.9 percent on Tuesday after the U.S. pressure pumper reported a lower than expected quarterly profit on weather-related delays and a higher mix of lower-margin services.  The Midland, Texas, company posted earnings per share of 12 cents in the fourth quarter, below analysts’ expectations of 35 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Fourth-quarter revenue of $313.7 million was roughly in line with expectations of $311.7 million. Pressure pumping has been a bright spot in the oilfield services sector, which was hit hard by a brutal three-year downturn in prices that began in 2014. ProPetro’s operations are focused in the Permian Basin, a shale patch in West Texas and New Mexico where there has been strong demand for completion services amid a surge in drilling activity.  ProPetro’s results were affected by inclement weather, a larger mix of less-lucrative vertical completion jobs than previously anticipated, and more time off during the holidays, the company said.  Harsh winter conditions in the northern United States impacted the company’s supply chain, Chief Executive Dale Redman told analysts on a conference call. He cited rail, which is used to haul in sand from Wisconsin and Minnesota for hydraulic fracturing. He said customers performed more vertical well completions because of lease obligations.  Oilfield services competitor Halliburton Co (HAL.N) last month warned investors that its first-quarter results also would be hurt by rail delays affecting frac sand deliveries. ProPetro plans to add two new fracking fleets in the second and third quarters of 2018, bringing its total to 20. The company also plans to enhance its legacy fleet by an incremental 35,000 hydraulic horsepower this year.  Although demand for fracking and other well-completion services has climbed, more announcements of new builds have sparked concerns among investors and analysts that the market may become oversupplied.  “While the domestic pressure pumping sector remains under supplied (and Permian new builds warranted), we believe this announcement could be viewed negatively by a market still fearful of frac over building in NAM (North America),” James West, senior managing director and partner at investment bank Evercore ISI, wrote in a note following the earnings release, referring to ProPetro’s plans to add two fleets.  ProPetro shares were down 7 percent at $15.78 in late morning, off an earlier low at $14.78.

531,HAL,INSIGHT-U.S.-trained engineer takes on Algeria's energy monolith,"ORAN, Algeria (Reuters) - When the U.S.-educated CEO of Algeria’s state energy company Sonatrach ended a speech to staff by seeking questions, an executive sitting next to him quickly picked up the microphone. “There are no questions,” he said, and some 1,000 employees filed straight out. The scene revealed the scale of the challenge facing Abdelmoumen Ould Kadour, who took over Sonatrach a year ago with a mission to improve communication and transparency in a company that is central to stability in Algeria and beyond. Sonatrach funds 60 percent of the state budget, and falling oil prices have created pressure for change, while Algeria’s role as a major gas supplier to Europe means new tension between the continent and gas giant Russia could play into his hands. He will soon unveil a plan to lift stagnant output and has revived ties with European oil majors. But project delays, fraud scandals, secrecy and red tape abound in a country where adults remember civil war and change is often resisted. “It’s hopeless,” he confided to colleagues accompanying him to the company office in the northwestern city of Oran, one of dozens of such visits by the 66-year-old alumnus of MIT and Harvard to Sonatrach outposts witnessed by Reuters. On his first day, he said on another occasion, he was given so much paperwork to sign he feared he would do little else. “There was no medium and long term strategy, there was no communication, no coordination between Sonatrach’s executives, every single piece of information was confidential.” No stranger to setbacks, he spent two years in an Algerian jail for collaborating with foreigners after a decade in charge of a joint Algerian-U.S. engineering company co-owned by oil services firm Halliburton. He has brought in his own team to lead the revamp at Sonatrach, declining requests for an interview but sharing his views during his tour of the company. A company source said his turnaround plan would be unveiled “within weeks, if not days”. Designed partly to attract foreign investment, it is likely to come during or before a conference he hosts on April 16-18 which the CEOs of France’s Total(TOTF.PA), Italy’s ENI(ENI.MI) and Norway’s Statoil(STL.OL) are expected to attend. His broad goal is to turn Sonatrach into an integrated energy company by 2030 from its current sprawling state, which includes an aircraft maker and extensive social programmes and excludes renewables, which come under the environment ministry. While Western CEOs will expect concrete steps after years of bold announcements, the plan has spread unease among executives, several of whom told Reuters they feared sweeping management changes in Ould Kadour’s declared battle with red tape. In Oran, he told staff that Statoil, set to resume work at the Hassi Mouina gas field, had previously left because of bureaucracy. “Better communication, a better environment is key to convince foreign partners to work in Algeria,” he said. A Sonatrach source said Statoil is expected to invest $500 mln in gas, a figure described by a Statoil source as “speculation”. Last month Statoil and Britain’s BP(BP.L) agreed to strengthen cooperation in upstream oil exploration and explore solar energy to allow Algeria to export more of its gas. In December Ould Kadour revived ties in December with Total, ENI and Saipem(SPMI.MI), but his ability to nurture those relationships and reverse years of stalling production will depend on how his company’s 40,000 employees respond to his message of change. He is an unlikely manager in a country known for secrecy and a suspicion of Westerners dating from ties to the Soviet Union and the trauma of the 1954-1962 independence war with France. But energy revenues have halved since 2014 and President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the 81-year old leader who might run for a fifth term next year, is struggling to maintain a welfare state necessary for social stability. The government has launched austerity measures, banning the import of 900 goods and freezing public sector hiring and development projects. Doctors and teachers have been on strike in several cities for three months demanding better pay and conditions and the state has been unable to end dissent by paying out as it did when a barrel of crude cost $100 instead of $70 as now. This has turned improving the efficiency of the state oil company into a political imperative. “Ould Kaddour has no choice but to succeed as Sonatrach’s CEO,” a former energy minister told Reuters. Critics of the CEO say he has only been appointed because of Bouteflika and will last no longer than his many predecessors. “If Bouteflika quits, Ould Kaddour would be sacked in the next five minutes,” a former Sonatrach executive said. With the presidential election looming, Ould Kadour has sought to cut Algeria’s import bill by recruiting oil trader Vitoil to swap crude for the petrol in growing need at home. “The strategy was to show that Algeria, which is a big oil producer, is not spending gigantic sums on imports of products,” an oil insider said. One delayed gas field was brought online last year with three more slated to start producing this year, lifting annual gas output of 94 billion cubic metres by 9 billion cubic metres. Sonatrach has signed a $1 billion deal with Turkey to build a petrochemical facility, discovered crude in Niger and explored cooperation with Iraq. It is also considering shale, but protests in 2015 from Algerians fearing environmental damage have made that politically unpalatable for now. In further signs of a balancing act, company sources say Sonatrach will offer more flexible short-term gas contracts on terms of 10-15 years or less instead of 20-25 and invest $250 million in the Tinhert gas field project using Algerian firms. Ould Kadour’s sentencing by a military court in 2007 on charges working for a foreign country was part of an internal regime conflict typical for Algeria, observers say. An elite made up of the ruling FLN party, army and security has controlled Algeria since independence, with officials or executives of state firms sometimes losing jobs when a new faction takes over in power plays behind closed doors. After serving his two-year jail term, he worked in Qatar, France, Senegal and the United Arab Emirates before Bouteflika made him Sonatrach CEO in March 2017. Anis Rahmani, owner of private Ennahar TV station, said the CEO had told him he was devastated by being branded a traitor. “But the man has vision, a plan to transform the company into a modern and performing one, which is not the case now,” he said. He is more powerful than the energy minister, one insider said, but must also win backing from politicians resistant to opening up the country too much. A key energy law has been stalled for years but a draft is now due in July. It is likely to retain Sonatrach’s majority stake in all energy projects but offer tax incentives for investors, a Sonatrach executive said. “The law needs to be attractive,” he said. “If not it will be useless.” ",3292018,http://www.reuters.com/article/algeria-energy/insight-u-s-trained-engineer-takes-on-algerias-energy-monolith-idUSL5N1QR23Y
532,HAL,Halliburton revenue jumps on higher North American demand,"(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Halliburton Co (HAL.N) reported a 34 percent jump in first-quarter revenue on Monday as North American companies boosted oil and gas production amid rising oil prices.  The jump in revenue came despite a $312 million writedown on Halliburton’s remaining assets in Venezuela, and a hit to earnings related to the impact of cold weather earlier in the quarter. Halliburton expects normalized margins of around 20 percent in North America by the end of this year, supported by ongoing tightness in the hydraulic fracturing market, Chief Executive Jeff Miller said on Monday.   “We believe the pressure pumping market is undersupplied and will remain tight,” Miller said, pointing to high fracking equipment utilization rates and service intensity that is degrading existing equipment. Some 3.3 million of additional hydraulic horsepower is expected to be added to the U.S. pressure pumping fleet this year, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. The additions have stoked concerns among investors that companies could overbuild equipment.  Halliburton’s revenue from North America jumped nearly 58 percent to $3.52 billion in the three months ended March 31, while revenue from international operations rose 9 percent.   Total revenue jumped to $5.74 billion from $4.28 billion. Its shares were trading at roughly $51.13 on Monday morning, off about 1.6 percent as part of a broader decline in energy stocks. U.S. crude futures CLc1 were trading around $67.40, down about 1.45 percent.  Adjusting for items, Halliburton posted a profit of 41 cents per share in the latest reported quarter, in line with analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Halliburton in February warned it expected a 10 cents per share hit to first-quarter earnings due to delays in deliveries of sand used in fracking. Net income attributable to Halliburton shareholders was $46 million, or 5 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31. The company posted a loss of $32 million, or 4 cents per share to shareholders, in the same quarter a year earlier.     The company said it continues to see tightness in the U.S. labor market, and in supply chain segments such as rail and trucking. Higher prices will be needed to absorb the impacts of wage inflation, Miller said during the company’s earnings call on Monday.  Halliburton on Monday also said it would remain in Venezuela, which has been plagued with political and economic turmoil, but carefully manage its exposure in the OPEC-member country.
