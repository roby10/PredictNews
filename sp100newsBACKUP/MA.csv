1,MA,EBay buys Zong as mobile payments gain traction,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - EBay Inc said on Thursday it agreed to buy cellphone payments provider Zong for about $240 million in cash to help its PayPal unit push further into mobile commerce.  EBay does not expect the deal to affect its financial outlook. It should close in the third quarter of 2011.  Zong is eBay’s seventh acquisition so far in 2011. Other deals this year include the purchase of GSI Commerce, Magento and Where. The company is buying businesses and technology that can help it work with more merchants as commerce moves increasingly online.  The strategy has been welcomed so far by investors. EBay shares rose 1.4 percent at $33.38 on Thursday afternoon, leaving them up more than 17 percent so far this year.  Zong is a leader in mobile payments for virtual and digital goods, offering one of the main ways to load up on social-networking currency Facebook Credits and quickly purchase items while playing social games like Zynga’s FarmVille.  Zong lets shoppers pay through their mobile phone account. When checking out online, a customer enters his or her number in a box. Zong verifies it and sends a text, to which the customer replies. The payment shows up on the wireless bill at the end of the month.  Zong has access to 3.2 billion mobile users through relationships with more than 250 wireless carriers in 45 countries.  For PayPal, the deal will let its 100 million users fund their accounts with their phones — something the company didn’t offer before.  The move comes as PayPal tries to defend its business against inroads by Visa, MasterCard, Google Inc and big U.S. banks, which are developing ways for customers to pay online or with phones as well as cards.  The total value of mobile payments may reach $670 billion by 2015, from $240 billion this year, according to a recent Juniper Research forecast.  “Online and offline payment worlds are blurring with the growth of mobile and smart phones,” said Dana Stalder, general partner of venture capital firm Matrix Partners, which invested in Zong.  “It’s increasingly important for anyone in the payment industry to have mobile phone numbers authenticated and attached to their wallet offerings,” added Stalder, a former PayPal employee who helped start projects including PayPal Mobile.  With Zong, PayPal gets 30 million authenticated phone numbers already attached to payment accounts, he noted.  In a typical online checkout, shoppers see four options: Visa, MasterCard, American Express and PayPal. The fifth option is paying with a mobile phone number, Stalder added.  “PayPal will effectively be the payment operator behind two of the five main payment options in online checkout flows,” he said.  Zong will also give PayPal another way to make sure its nine million merchants get sales completed online quickly and smoothly.  Wireless carriers have low limits on transaction sizes and volume currently. If a Zong mobile purchase hits such caps, it will be easy to shift that transaction to another source of cash in the PayPal system, Stalder explained.  “What the merchant cares about is completed transactions,” he said. “This is a way of offering more funds-in capabilities and higher converting checkout flow for merchants.”  Ultimately, Stalder sees an opportunity for a company to create a “wallet in the cloud” that is funded by all sources of money and can be used to pay for anything online and offline.  In May, Google, MasterCard, Citigroup, Sprint and transaction processing company First Data unveiled a new service that lets shoppers pay for things with mobile phones.  A day after the announcement, PayPal sued Google for allegedly stealing trade secrets related to mobile payment systems.  On Thursday, PayPal Chief Financial Officer Patrick Dupuis said the Zong purchase wasn’t a reaction to rivals’ efforts to build mobile wallet businesses.  “There’s been a lot of chit chat on this. We don’t think mobile wallet. We just think wallet. We’re there. We’ve been in digital for six years,” Dupuis told Reuters. “I think it’s the other guys who are trying to compete with us.”  ",7072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ebay/ebay-buys-zong-as-mobile-payments-gain-traction-idUSTRE7663E420110707
2,MA,Swiss police raid cyber attack suspect's home," * Police in Ticino confiscated computer material	   * Man suspected of carrying out cyber attacks 	   ZURICH, July 7 (Reuters) - Swiss police have searched the home of an Italian citizen suspected of carrying out cyber attacks in Italy, prosecutors said on Thursday.	   “We confiscated computer material we will now have to examine closely,” said Xaverio Snider, a spokesman for the prosecutor’s office in Lugano, a lakeside town in Switzerland’s Italian-speaking Ticino region, an hour north of Milan.	   The man is suspected of being part of the Internet activist group “Anonymous” that attacked websites it considered hostile to WikiLeaks after it posted confidential U.S. diplomatic cables on its website last year. 	   Online payments service PayPal and credit card giants Visa and MasterCard were among Anonymous’ targets.	   Snider said the Swiss authorities intervened at the demand of their Italian counterparts, as all the alleged offenses had been committed in Italy.	   “The man is an Italian citizen but he was born in Ticino and has lived here all his life,” he said.	   Police in Italy said they have identified a group of hackers who have carried out several cyber attacks on Italian institutions and companies since January.	   Italy’s anti-cyber crime police CNAIPIC have identified three people, including a minor. So far they have made 32 raids in Italy, as well as the Lugano raid conducted in coordination with Swiss authorities, Italian police said in a statement.	   “The damage caused to institutions and companies hit by an attack is extensive; they are no longer able to provide services to users while the return to normal functioning of the web site often takes several hours, coming with a considerable cost,” police said.

3,MA,Exclusive: WikiLeaks loses Icelandic financial lifeline,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has lost a financial lifeline. Since December, bans by the world’s major credit card networks, it has been difficult for supporters of the controversial whistleblower to send him donations. But this week, WikiLeaks gained a brief respite with the unwitting help of an Icelandic bank.  The window was quickly closed.  On Thursday, WikiLeaks payments provider DataCell said it could start processing donations to Assange’s group again, circumventing a months-long ban by Visa and MasterCard.  An Icelandic bank called Valitor had agreed to accept payments processed by DataCell, but DataCell did not tell Valitor that those payments would include donations to WikiLeaks, the bank told Reuters on Friday.  “Valitor was not informed that DataCell would be conducting these activities when their business agreement was made,” spokeswoman Jonina Ingvadottir told Reuters in an emailed statement on Friday.  She cited Visa and MasterCard’s prohibition on the “service such as DataCell is offering WikiLeaks.”  The world’s two largest credit card processing networks were among several companies to cut off services to WikiLeaks late last year after the whistleblower organization made public a massive trove of secret U.S. diplomatic cables.  One person familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Friday that Valitor had blocked the Visa and MasterCard WikiLeaks donations and terminated its contract with DataCell.  Fewer than 100 donations were processed before Valitor blocked the payments, the person said.  Other media outlets this week reported that it was Visa Europe that discontinued the WikiLeaks donations, but DataCell told Reuters that Valitor discontinued all donations to WikiLeaks it had been accepting.  The failed Valitor partnership is the latest blow to Assange, who has struggled to gain funding since the major payments networks stopped processing payments to WikiLeaks.  The Internet vigilante group Anonymous temporarily shut down the public websites of both Visa and MasterCard in December after the companies began their embargo.  Visa and MasterCard send money from bank to bank around the world, on behalf of consumers, companies, governments and other organizations. But those organizations, including WikiLeaks and its processing partner, need bank partners.  DataCell founder Olaf Sigurvinsson confirmed that Valitor had terminated the contract with his company this week. He told Reuters that when he signed the contract with Valitor, “it was absolutely clear that we were going to continue our proposal to collect donations,” including to WikiLeaks.  He said DataCell has filed a complaint over Valitor’s actions to the financial supervisor in Iceland, and that it plans to file one to the European Union.  Visa Europe spokeswoman Amanda Kamin said in an email on Friday that “an acquirer briefly accepted payments on a merchant site linked to WikiLeaks.” She said as soon as this came to Visa’s attention, action was taken. Kamin did not elaborate further.  MasterCard said it has not changed its position on the WikiLeaks donation embargo.

4,MA,"WikiLeaks partner loses Visa, MasterCard loophole","   * DataCell found new bank to accept WikiLeaks donations   * Bank shut down donations within hours   * Visa, MasterCard embargo on WikiLeaks continues   By Maria Aspan   NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - A WikiLeaks partner found a new bank to accept Visa (V.N) and MasterCard (MA.N) donations this week, but the respite from the card networks’ months-long embargo was only temporary, because the bank shut down the payments within hours, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.   Visa and MasterCard, the world’s two largest card networks, blocked donations to WikiLeaks in December. But on Thursday, WikiLeaks payments provider DataCell said it could start processing donations to Julian Assange’s group again.

Fewer than 100 donations were processed before Valitor blocked the payments, the person said.   Other media outlets this week reported that it was Visa Europe that discontinued the Wikileaks donations, but DataCell confirmed to Reuters that Valitor discontinued all donations to Wikileaks it had been accepting.   It is the latest wrinkle in the long battle over payments to WikiLeaks. The Internet vigilante group Anonymous temporarily shut down the public websites of both Visa and MasterCard in December, after both card network companies stopped processing donations to WikiLeaks.

5,MA,EU wants to track cash in terrorism probes," * EU wants to track cash of terrorism suspects        * Data privacy cloud U.S. anti-terror efforts in Europe        By Francesco Guarascio        BRUSSELS, July 12 (Reuters) - Credit card companies such as Mastercard and Visa may be forced to share transaction data with European Union authorities under plans to investigate terrorism financing in Europe, due to be presented on Wednesday.        The EU’s executive Commission is set to unveil plans for a mechanism to collect and monitor financial information linked to terrorism suspects that would mirror similar efforts in the United States, EU officials said.        Like their U.S. counterparts, EU investigators would rely largely on data about bank transfers, collected by companies such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).        But EU officials say the scope of the programme could be extended to other sources of information about cash used by people suspected of terrorist activities, such as credit-card or money transfer companies.        “Other providers can also include credit companies,” one Commission official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.        Policymakers have pushed for the creation of a European system to track suspect cash and complement efforts in the United States because of concerns over data privacy when data is shared with investigators outside Europe.        Such worries had dogged talks between the EU and the United States over sharing bank transfer data provided by SWIFT last year and had led the European Parliament to veto a deal, before Washington agreed to more privacy safeguards.        As part of a deal giving Washington access to SWIFT data, U.S. policymakers agreed last year to help the EU create its own programme to track suspect cash.        U.S. investigators have tracked cash linked to terrorism suspects since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.   They say the data collected has helped investigations into numerous attacks in Europe, such as the 2004 bombings in Madrid and those in London in 2005.        But the amount of data transferred has been a cause of concern for EU lawmakers who say passing data about EU citizens in bulk violates their rights.        Setting up a European programme would alleviate some concerns, but the process is likely to take years. EU governments, and the parliament, will have decide exactly how data should be collected and used.        In a document to be presented on Wednesday, and seen by Reuters, the European Commission will suggest several options for creating the mechanism, with varying level of involvement by EU governments.

6,MA,UPDATE 1-US July 4 gasoline demand hits 4 yr low-MasterCard,"   * Independence Day demand 1.7 pct lower than last year   * Gasoline prices up 3 cents a gallon week-on-week   * Demand down 2.1 pct year-on-year last week   (Updates throughout)   NEW YORK, July 12 (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline demand for the July 4 holiday this year dropped to the lowest level since 2007 as Americans cut back on driving due to high pump prices, MasterCard’s weekly SpendingPulse analysis showed on Tuesday.   Just under 35 million barrels of gasoline were sold at retail locations nationwide over the four-day holiday weekend that started on July 1, MasterCard said, 1.7 percent lower than a year ago.   Independence day demand was stronger even in 2008 when oil had sold for as high as $145 a barrel and retail prices had jumped 37.5 percent from the previous year, SpendingPulse gasoline analyst John Gamel told Reuters.   “The overall trend is going back to negative territory,” said Gamel, adding: “Prices are 30-plus percent above last year’s levels and people are still cutting discretionary driving.”   The average price of gasoline rose 3 cents from the previous week to $3.58 a gallon, led by a sharp hike in Midwest gasoline prices, where outages at regional refineries buoyed prices in states such as Ohio, Michigan and Illinois.   On average, last week’s prices were 34.1 percent higher than the same week a year earlier.   The holiday driving demand also suffered because of heavy summer rains, particularly in northeast United States, where MasterCard registered the sharpest week-on-week decline.   By the end of the week, demand had dipped 2.1 percent year-on-year and dropped 5.5 percent from the previous week, the report showed.   “What we’re seeing is a general decline as the half-mark of the summer season approaches,” said Gamel.   Over the latest four weeks, average U.S. gasoline consumption fell 1.1 percent from year-earlier levels.   (Graphic on four-week average demand: link.reuters.com/dah62k)   MasterCard Advisors, a unit of MasterCard Inc (MA.N), estimates retail gasoline demand based on aggregate sales in the MasterCard payments system coupled with estimates for other payment forms including cash and checks.

7,MA,WikiLeaks files complaint over Visa and Mastercard,"LONDON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks and the Icelandic IT company DataCell filed a formal complaint to the European Commission on Thursday, saying payment companies Visa Europe and MasterCard Inc violated EU antitrust laws by blocking donations.  Visa Europe, which runs the largest card network in the European Union, and MasterCard blocked WikiLeaks from using its network to collect funds from donors in December 2010.  The complaint, filed to the Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission, says Visa and MasterCard breached antitrust provisions set out by Articles 101 and 102 of the EU Treaty.  DataCell, which has an agreement to collect credit card donations on behalf of WikiLeaks, says the credit card giants engaged in anti-competitive behavior and abused their dominant market position.  WikiLeaks, led by Australian Julian Assange, urged the EU Commission to order both credit card companies to lift their ban with “immediate effect.”  Visa and MasterCard stopped processing donations for WikiLeaks after the United States criticized the organization’s release of sensitive diplomatic cables.  Visa said last December that it was investigating whether the nature of WikiLeaks’ business contravened its operating rules.  Cyber hackers supporting WikiLeaks retaliated by attacking the Visa and Mastercard websites.  WikiLeaks has come under increased international scrutiny after releasing a slew of diplomatic cables that have embarrassed Washington.  Assange has also been subject to allegations of sexually assaulting two women in Sweden, which date from August, 2010.

10,MA,UPDATE 2-US arrests 14 for roles in PayPal cyber attack," * 14 arrested for Wikileaks revenge cyber attack on PayPal   * AT&T contractor also arrested for leaking sensitive docs  (Adds details about arrests in U.S. and Europe)   By Jeremy Pelofsky and Diane Bartz   WASHINGTON, July 19 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Tuesday arrested 16 people on charges they participated in major cyber attacks, including the crippling of eBay’s (EBAY.O) PayPal website as retribution for dropping WikiLeaks as a client.   FBI agents arrested 14 people in nine states and Washington, D.C., for the PayPal attack, which occurred last December and was allegedly coordinated by the hacking group Anonymous. It was the biggest response by authorities tied to a recent spate of high-profile cyber attacks.   Financial institutions like PayPal, Visa (V.N) and MasterCard (MA.N) withdrew services from WikiLeaks last year after the website published thousands of sometimes embarrassing secret U.S. diplomatic reports that have caused strains between Washington and numerous allies.   Hackers responded with so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks that flooded the companies’ websites with requests for information and rendered them unavailable to legitimate users, according to the indictment filed in federal court in San Jose, California.   PayPal suffered attacks for several days last December. Company spokesman Anuj Nayar said he could not comment on current legal action.   The 14 individuals were charged with conspiracy, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison if convicted, and intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.   The accused ranged in ages from 20 to 42 and lived in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico and Ohio.   One of the difficulties authorities have had tracking down hacking attacks is that they can be launched from anywhere and can come from an individual who can mask his location.   Law enforcement authorities believe Anonymous is mostly made up of hackers believed to be in their teens and early 20s. The group has taken credit for numerous attacks, including against Bank of America, Sony and the Malaysian government.   “The fact that they have been tracked back and that some of them have been arrested is a significant development,” said Mark Rasch, a former chief of the Justice Department’s cyber crimes unit and now director of Cybersecurity and Privacy Consulting for the government technology services firm CSC.   In a likely sign investigations are intensifying, U.S. authorities executed more than 35 search warrants around the country in their investigation of coordinated cyber attacks against major companies and organizations, the Justice Department said.   The Justice Department and FBI have been under pressure to crack down on hackers who have stepped up their attacks on corporate and government websites in the past several months in a bid to thwart their activities.   Stewart Baker, a former top official of the Homeland Security Department, said the FBI probably gave the case extra attention because of the public taunting the bureau received from Anonymous and related groups.   “It does look like some of these guys (hackers) were just fools. The PayPal attack in particular,” said Baker, now at the law firm Steptoe and Johnson LLP. “It looks like these bozos must have just said ‘Cool, an attack on PayPal. You can use my machine.’   “I think it makes it a lot less likely that that people will join the next digital lynch mob,” he said.   Another related arrest came in New Mexico where an employee for a contractor for AT&T’s wireless service faced charges of accessing a computer without authorization by allegedly downloading thousands of documents related to its 4G data network and LTE mobile broadband network.   The data was subsequently downloaded to a file-sharing web site in April and another one of the loosely organized groups of hackers, Lulz Security, subsequently publicized the data breach, the complaint said. AT&T had no comment on the arrest.   The other man arrested by FBI agents was in Florida where he was charged with illegally accessing Tampa Bay Infragard’s website and uploading three malicious files. The group is an FBI-sponsored organization focused on critical infrastructure.   The Justice Department said British police arrested one person and Dutch authorities arrested four for cyber crimes related to recent attacks on major companies and organizations.

11,MA,UPDATE 2-FBI arrests 14 in probe of hacker group Anonymous," * Arrests in three states- source   * Action comes after Anoymous claimed big attacks  (Recasts with 14 arrests)   NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - The FBI arrested at least 14 people on Tuesday as part of a wide-ranging investigation of the Internet vigilante hacking group Anonymous, a law enforcement source said.   The arrests came after claims by the group it broke into Apple Inc (AAPL.O) servers and launched attacks last year that shut down sites of MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and Visa Inc (V.N).   Arrests were made in California, Florida and New Jersey, a second law enforcement source said.   Neither source wanted to be identified as charges had not been unsealed.   The arrests followed raids on six locations in New York, including one in Brooklyn and five others on Long Island. They were searched for computers and computer-related accessories, the FBI said.   The equipment was suspected of being used by members of the grass-roots organization inspired by WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange.   No arrests were made in New York.   FBI officials in California and Florida said searches were underway but declined to confirm any arrests.   A spokesman for the FBI in New Jersey said one arrest was made there but declined to say where or on what charges.   Court papers for the sweep were expected to be unsealed later on Tuesday.   Anonymous, which law enforcement authorities believe is mostly made up of hackers believed to be in their teens and early 20s, also has released scores of private e-mails and other data from an Arizona police website.   The group teamed up with the Lulz Security group of hackers in June. LulzSec has breached websites of Sony Corp, the CIA and a British police unit.   Experts say the FBI raids should have been expected as the group’s actions have become more daring.   “I don’t think anybody should be surprised,” said Josh Shaul, chief technical officer of Application Security, Inc., which helps companies protect their data. “They played with fire and they got burned.”  ",7192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fbi-hacking/update-2-fbi-arrests-14-in-probe-of-hacker-group-anonymous-idUSN1E76I11C20110719
12,MA,UPDATE 2-Isis hooks up with four payment networks," * Isis in deals with Visa, MasterCard, Discover, Amex   * Still expects to offer service in 2012   * Sees 2012 launch with “handful” of banks   (Adds Isis comment, background)   By Sinead Carew   NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) -  Isis, a venture of three of the top four U.S. mobile providers, plans to launch mobile payments services with major payment networks Visa (V.N), MasterCard (MA.N), Discover (DFS.N) and American Express (AXP.N), the venture said on Tuesday.   The venture of Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc (T.N), and T-Mobile USA hopes to convince consumers to start using their mobile phones to pay for goods instead of plastic credit cards or cash.   Isis, which plans to kick off its service in the first half of 2012, will compete with Google Inc (GOOG.O) and No. 3 U.S. mobile service Sprint Nextel (S.N), which plan to launch services this summer.   Now that it has signed up the four payment networks, Isis expects to be able to more easily finalize deals with banks that issue credit cards, Ryan Hughes, Isis Chief Marketing Officer, told Reuters.   “It delivers a message to the banking community,” said Hughes, who noted that banks needed to know that their payment network partners would work with Isis before signing up as partners for the service.   Which payment networks are involved in the service launch depends on whether Isis has been able to sign up the network’s bank partners, said Hughes, who expects to have a “handful” of banks ready for its launch next year.   Participating banks need to invest in new technology to support a mobile payments and several have already done so, according to Hughes, who would not name bank partners.   Isis expects to make money from the service by generating revenue from their financial services partners and by offering merchants the option to link loyalty programs or coupon offerings to the Isis service, the executive said.   For example, instead of printing out a coupon found on a merchant’s website, consumers would be able to click on an Isis button to have the coupon delivered to their cellphone. Then the coupon could be applied automatically during a mobile transaction in that merchant’s store.   Hughes said merchants will be able to access an application interface to link their offerings with Isis.   While the company is still working on pricing for mobile payments, Hughes said he expects Isis to “take a small percentage of the cost of delivering” an ad or coupon to the Isis application.

15,MA,FBI raid seeks suspected 'Anonymous' computers," NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - The FBI on Tuesday raided three homes in New York for computers suspected of being used by members of the Internet vigilante hacking group Anonymous, an agency spokesman said.   One residence in Brooklyn and two others on Long Island were searched for computers and computer-related accessories. At least one laptop was removed from one of the homes, the FBI said.   No one was arrested.   “The searches are in connection to an ongoing investigation,” FBI spokesman Peter Donald said.   Anonymous, a grass-roots organization inspired by WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange, claimed to have broken into Apple Inc (AAPL.O) servers earlier this month.   It also launched attacks in December that temporarily shut down sites of MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and Visa Inc (V.N) using simple software tools freely available over the Internet.   Anonymous also has released scores of private e-mails and other data from an Arizona police website.   The group teamed up with the Lulz Security group of hackers in June. LulzSec has breached websites of Sony Corp (6758.T), the CIA and a British police unit.

16,MA,"EBay's PayPal going offline, targets big retailers","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - EBay Inc’s PayPal business has become one of the largest online payment systems, but its now heading offline, Chief Executive John Donahoe said in the wake of the e-commerce company’s quarterly results on Wednesday.  “We intend to help retailers grow their businesses offline in the same way we helped merchants grow online,” Donahoe said during a conference call with analysts.  PayPal will be testing “point-of-sale innovation” with a major U.S. retailer by the end of this year, he added.  During 2012, PayPal will roll out in-store payment services with up to 20 national retailers, Donahoe predicted, without identifying the companies.  EBay reported second-quarter results late Wednesday that were dented by acquisition costs, and the e-commerce company forecast third-quarter profit just below analyst forecasts, sending shares 1 percent lower to $32.58.  PayPal reported $1.073 billion in second-quarter net revenue, up 31 percent from a year earlier. That’s the first time PayPal has generated more than $1 billion in quarterly revenue.  PayPal’s growth has been driven by online payments. But Donahoe said on Wednesday that the boom in smartphone usage is blurring the lines between online and offline commerce.  “We’ve had merchants reach out to us quite aggressively, and saying they want us to bring PayPal into the Point of Sale,” he added. “We see it as an incremental opportunity, and a fairly significant incremental opportunity that will play out over the next three to five years.”  Ken Sena, an analyst at Evercore Partners, said investors want eBay to pursue the offline payments opportunity more aggressively.  One way may be to partner with daily deal companies including Groupon and LivingSocial, Sena said. Donahoe said eBay would consider such partnerships.  EBay has stressed that it’s agnostic about what mobile payment standards emerge as the dominant technologies, arguing PayPal will work with all platforms.  Near-Field Communication, or NFC, is one emerging technology that may let shoppers buy with their mobile phones.  Evercore’s Sena said eBay hasn’t described a strategy to help create the main standard. The concern is that once the standard is established, PayPal may not be the main way to pay.  “That’s dead wrong,” Donahoe told Reuters on Wednesday. “Merchants will make the decision.”  The only standard that will be accepted by big merchants will be one that accepts all payment systems, including those run by MasterCard, Visa and PayPal, he explained.  With roughly 100 million “wallets in the cloud” PayPal is too big to be excluded, Donahoe added.  EBay said second-quarter net income was $283.4 million, or 22 cents per share — down from $412 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. The decline in earnings was mainly driven by costs from eBay’s acquisition of GSI Commerce earlier this year.  “They are incorporating a new division and there are always costs associated with a large acquisition like this,” said Bill Smead of Smead Capital Management, which owns eBay shares.  Smead also noted that eBay shares have peaked several times around $34.50 during the past 3-1/2 years.  “It might take a little more good news to get it through there,” he said. “I’m not surprised to see a little selling as it approaches this level.”  Excluding acquisition costs, stock-based compensation expenses and other items, profit was $630.9 million, or 48 cents per share, versus $530 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier.  On that basis, both the profit and the revenue beat expectations.  Analysts on average expected EBay to make 46 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue in the latest period was $2.8 billion, up 25 percent from the second quarter of 2010. Second-quarter revenue was expected to be $2.607 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  EBay said it expects third-quarter earnings per share to be 46 cents to 47 cents a share. Analysts were forecasting third-quarter profit of 47 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  EBay will increase marketing spending in the second half of 2011, after keeping such investments flat in recent years, Donahoe told analysts during Wednesday’s conference call.  EBay will run television ads late in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter to try to lure more customers back to the company’s online marketplace and attract new buyers, he noted.  “I’ve said for now a couple of years that we’re holding off increasing marketing and focusing on our current customers until we get our user experience to the place where we feel it’s ready,” Donahoe said. “And we feel like we’ve passed that point now.”  Gross merchandise value, or GMV, excluding vehicle sales — a closely watched measure of activity on eBay’s Marketplace — rose 17 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, to $14.7 billion, eBay reported.  Sena of Evercore Partners said growth in gross merchandise value “shows the marketplaces business is undoubtedly pretty strong” and that changes in pricing and to the site were paying off.

18,MA,Analysis: Groupon growth lures rivals and regulators,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Groupon Inc’s rapid growth has attracted rivals and regulators, a twin threat to the largest online daily deal company as it gets ready for an initial public offering.  At a daily deals conference in San Francisco this week, executives from AT&T Inc, MasterCard Inc and Facebook described plans to expand in the industry. Google Inc, which tried to buy Groupon last year, is forging ahead with its own daily discounts on local goods and services.  “Groupon has faced big challenges this year and a lot of those have come from competitors,” said Boyan Josic, chief executive officer of daily deal tracker DailyDealMedia. “It’s a huge new sector that’s growing like crazy and there are no real regulations or industry standards.”  Last week, Connecticut’s attorney general said Groupon’s vouchers might violate state law. And industry regulation will be the topic of a panel discussion at a DailyDealMedia conference in September.  Groupon filed for an initial public offering in June, saying it hoped to raise at least $750 million. The IPO may value Groupon at $20 billion or more, although concern about competition and regulation may limit that.  “These problems call into question Groupon’s valuation,” said Harvard Business School associate professor Ben Edelman. “With competitors and regulators nipping at Groupon’s heels, the company may be worth less than their prospectus suggests.”  A Groupon spokesman said the company is planning on “working with regulators to explain our business model and practices,” but declined to comment on competition.  The daily deal industry may generate as much as $6.1 billion in annual gross revenue by 2015, up from $873 million last year, according to BIA/Kelsey, which tracks local advertising.  That growth potential has attracted a lot of new entrants. New York-based Yipit tracks more than 400 U.S. daily deal websites, up from about 20 in early 2010, said data product manager David Sinsky.  “In the last 12 months, there’s been an explosion in the quantity of competitors,” Sinsky said. “In the next 12 months, the quality of competition will increase.”  AT&T, MasterCard, Google and Facebook will be the biggest threats to Groupon, he said.  Amazon.com Inc started offering daily deals last month through its AmazonLocal service. The Internet retailer sources most of the deals from LivingSocial, Groupon’s closest competitor. Amazon bought part of LivingSocial in late 2010.  American Express Co said on Tuesday it would offer deals to card members in a partnership with Facebook.  AT&T Interactive, which runs the telephone company’s online yellow pages business, introduced daily deals in Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth and Los Angeles on Monday.  To source daily deals, the company is using “a fraction” of its roughly 5,000-member sales force, which sells yellow pages ads and other marketing services to local merchants, said AT&T Interactive Chief Executive Officer David Krantz.  “We’re able to self-fund and start this thing from existing resources,” he added.  By contrast, Groupon has spent heavily to recruit thousands of sales people in the past year.  Groupon is still the clear leader with 48 percent of the daily deal market, according to Yipit data for May, but that is down from 52 percent in April. Meanwhile, LivingSocial’s share rose to 24 percent from 20 percent.  Competition has already affected Groupon’s operations, Yipit’s Sinsky said.  Subscriber acquisition costs rose almost threefold in the first quarter from a year earlier, while the cost of attracting Groupon-buying customers jumped fourfold, according data in the company’s IPO filing.  And while the number of vouchers sold rose to about 28 million from 1.76 million, they fell on a per-subscriber basis to 0.42 from 0.67, data from the filing show.  Groupon typically takes 50 percent of revenue generated from deals, while merchants take the rest. But the company’s share has started slipping with the entry of rivals such as Google, whose commission is only in the mid-30 percent range, Sinsky noted.  Regulation may also change the way Groupon operates.  The main question is whether states decide Groupon’s deals are gift certificates, which are subject to expiration rules.  Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said last week that Groupon’s daily deals could violate a state law that prohibits expiration dates on gift certificates.  California also bans expiration dates on gift certificates. Under Massachusetts law, gift certificates are good for seven years.  Groupon deals usually last a year or less. If the company has to extend expiration dates, merchants might be less willing to sign up for deals, it warned in its IPO filing. Groupon would be on the hook to pay merchants for a longer time, increasing its liabilities.  Some U.S. states and overseas jurisdictions require money on unused gift certificates to go to the government. Groupon said it did not turn those funds over now, but warned that a successful challenge to its position could also increase liabilities.

19,MA,U.S. arrests 14 for roles in PayPal cyber attack,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Tuesday arrested 16 people on charges they participated in major cyber attacks, including an attempt to cripple eBay’s PayPal website as retribution for dropping WikiLeaks as a client.  FBI agents arrested 14 people in nine states and Washington, D.C., for the PayPal attack, which occurred last December and was allegedly coordinated by the hacking group Anonymous. It was the biggest response by authorities tied to a recent spate of high-profile cyber attacks.  Financial institutions like PayPal, Visa and MasterCard withdrew services from WikiLeaks last year after the website published thousands of sometimes embarrassing secret U.S. diplomatic reports that have caused strains between Washington and numerous allies.  Hackers responded with so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks that flooded the companies’ websites with requests for information and rendered them unavailable to legitimate users, according to the indictment filed in federal court in San Jose, California.  PayPal suffered attacks for several days last December. Company spokesman Anuj Nayar said he could not comment on current legal action.  The 14 individuals were charged with conspiracy, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison if convicted, and intentional damage to a protected computer, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.  The accused ranged in age from 20 to 42 and lived in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico and Ohio.  One of the difficulties authorities have had tracking down hacking attacks is that they can be launched from anywhere and can come from an individual who can mask his location.  Law enforcement authorities believe Anonymous is mostly made up of hackers believed to be in their teens and early 20s. The group has taken credit for numerous attacks, including attacks on Bank of America, Sony and the Malaysian government.  “The fact that they have been tracked back and that some of them have been arrested is a significant development,” said Mark Rasch, a former chief of the Justice Department’s cyber crimes unit and now director of Cybersecurity and Privacy Consulting for the government technology services firm CSC.  In a likely sign investigations are intensifying, U.S. authorities executed more than 35 search warrants around the country in their investigation of coordinated cyber attacks against major companies and organizations, the Justice Department said.  The Justice Department and FBI have been under pressure to crack down on hackers who have stepped up their attacks on corporate and government websites in the past several months in a bid to thwart their activities.  Stewart Baker, a former top official of the Homeland Security Department, said the FBI probably gave the case extra attention because of the public taunting the bureau received from Anonymous and related groups.  “It does look like some of these guys (hackers) were just fools. The PayPal attack in particular,” said Baker, now at the law firm Steptoe and Johnson LLP. “It looks like these bozos must have just said ‘Cool, an attack on PayPal. You can use my machine.’  “I think it makes it a lot less likely that that people will join the next digital lynch mob,” he said.  Another related arrest came in New Mexico where an employee for a contractor for AT&T’s wireless service faced charges of accessing a computer without authorization by allegedly downloading thousands of documents related to its 4G data network and LTE mobile broadband network.  The data was subsequently downloaded to a file-sharing web site in April and another one of the loosely organized groups of hackers, Lulz Security, subsequently publicized the data breach, the complaint said. AT&T had no comment on the arrest.  The other man arrested by FBI agents was in Florida, where he was charged with illegally accessing Tampa Bay Infragard’s website and uploading three malicious files. The group is an FBI-sponsored organization focused on critical infrastructure.

21,MA,U.S. cyber arrests seen leading to more hackers," * FBI seized computers and other records during arrests   * Likelihood of prison time has not sunk in, official says   By Jeremy Pelofsky   WASHINGTON, July 21 (Reuters) - The FBI’s arrest this week of 16 people who allegedly participated in high-profile cyber attacks is providing a treasure trove of information and will lead to further arrests, a U.S. law enforcement official told Reuters on Thursday.   The crackdown — on members of the group Anonymous — was the biggest reaction so far by U.S. authorities to a string of cyber attacks, and was meant to serve as a deterrent to others who may be considering joining the cause.   The arrests spanned nine states and the District of Columbia. FBI agents also executed more than 35 search warrants, seizing computers and other records. Those arrested could try to strike plea agreements offering to provide information to win more lenient treatment. [ID:nN1E76I23K]   Some private cybersecurity specialists have questioned whether the raids will have much lasting impact.   But the law enforcement official said, “This is the good example of a significant event that successfully removed a number of individuals from being part of the problem and will certainly lead to information that will result in locating other subjects.” The official declined to be further identified while speaking about an ongoing law enforcement investigation.   Members of Anonymous mounted attacks last year against eBay’s (EBAY.O) PayPal as well as Visa (V.N) and Mastercard (MA.N) after the companies severed their relationships with the WikiLeaks organization. The attacks included flooding the sites with data trying to render them inoperable.   The arrests included members of Anonymous at various levels of the loose-knit organization, the official said. The official declined to comment on whether they knew each other.   While attacks by Anonymous and related “hacktivist” groups have drawn wide attention, other cyber crimes aimed at espionage are a higher priority for the FBI. The latter have included intrusions at Google (GOOG.O), Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) and the International Monetary Fund.   “We didn’t pull resources away from those higher priority cases to work this,” the official said.   It remains an open question whether the arrests will have the desired deterrent effect. Anonymous and another hacking group, Lulz Security, issued a statement on Thursday saying they would continue their efforts.   “I think they (the FBI) are trying to send a signal that this isn’t cost-free in the hopes that it will scare off some of the others. If we’re lucky it will work,” said James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.   The law enforcement official said that people allegedly involved in the cyber attacks probably did not realize the risks of prison time and that prosecutors would likely seek stiff sentences. Those arrested, if convicted, could face up to 10 years in prison for trying to damage a protected computer.   “They’re probably not the types of people who have been prepared for any time in jail. This is not a joke,” the official said. “The reality of the fact that this is both a crime and that people will be actually doing time in jail I think really hasn’t sunk in to a lot of people who are getting involved in these activities.”   Lewis said one possible benefit from the cyber attacks is that it will lead network and website administrators to beef up their security.   “These guys exploit poor configuration, and that’s the simplest thing to fix but there’s just so much of it out there it will take a while,” Lewis said.

The arrest of the 19-year-old man, who UK police said goes by the hacker nickname “Topiary,” may be the most significant to date in a global effort to end a cyber-crime spree by the hacker activist groups Lulz Security and Anonymous.  Topiary is believed to have controlled the main Twitter account of Lulz Security, which the group used to publish data obtained by hacking into corporate and government networks. The messages were written in an irreverent style, filled with sarcasm, expletives and inside jokes that were sometimes difficult to decipher.  The arrest was part of a “pre-planned, intelligence-led operation,” the police service said.  “The arrest of ‘Topiary’ is important as it sends a strong message to other hackers or would-be hackers,” said Chet Wisniewski, a security researcher with UK anti-virus software maker Sophos.  “While many have found the antics of Lulz Security entertaining, breaking into computers and stealing the personal details of innocent people is a serious crime,” he said.  British police said the suspect was being held at a house in the remote Shetland Islands, off Scotland’s northeast coast, though they planned to take him to a police station in central London.  LulzSec has claimed responsibility for cyber-attacks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, multiple Sony Corp websites and the website of Murdoch’s British newspaper group, News International.  The group has attracted widespread global media coverage for its stunts and has nearly 350,000 followers on Twitter, the messaging website.  Last month, British police charged Ryan Cleary, 19, with attacking the website of Britain’s Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA) and sites owned by the British Phonographic Industry and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry.  Cleary, arrested as part of a joint investigation by London police and the U.S. FBI into recent attacks on high-profile websites, was given bail.  The FBI raided six locations in New York earlier this month and conducted searches in California as part of an investigation into the hacking group Anonymous.  The groups issued a statement on Wednesday, saying that the FBI had wrongfully arrested some of their supporters for participating in “digital sit-ins.” Those campaigns had temporarily shut down the websites of targeted groups by overwhelming them with Internet traffic.  “Anonymous ‘suspects’ may face a fine of up to $500,000, with the addition of 15 years’ jail time, all for taking part in a historical activist movement,” the statement said.  The statement also urged supporters to boycott eBay Inc’s PayPal electronic payment service. It asked supporters to close their PayPal accounts.  The hacker activists have previously attacked PayPal to show their opposition to the service’s refusal to process payments to WikiLeaks, the website founded by Julian Assange that published copies of secret U.S. government diplomatic cables.  A spokesman for PayPal said the company had observed no changes in normal operations, including the number of accounts that had been closed overnight.  Anonymous also claimed to have broken into Apple Inc servers in July. It also launched attacks in December that temporarily shut down sites of MasterCard Inc and Visa Inc using simple software available on the Internet.

Average gasoline demand dipped 3.1 percent year-on-year, the weekly report said, though it crept higher by 0.1 percent from the previous week.  ""Higher prices, extreme hot weather and uncertain economic conditions could all be playing a part in suppressing gasoline consumption this year,"" Spending Pulse gasoline analyst John Gamel said.  ""Gasoline prices appeared to have leveled off for now after some fairly sharp increases in the first half of July.""  (Graphic: link.reuters.com/dah62k)  The average price of a gallon of gasoline rose for the fourth week running, but the rate of increase slowed, adding just 1 cent last week at $3.70.  Gasoline prices are up 15 cents since the beginning of July. Last week's prices were 35.5 percent higher than the same week a year ago.  Over the latest four weeks, average U.S. gasoline consumption dropped 1.9 percent from year-ago levels, the 19th consecutive week that the four-week average has fallen behind last year.  MasterCard Advisors, a unit of MasterCard Inc (MA.N), estimates retail gasoline demand based on aggregate sales in the MasterCard payments system coupled with estimates for other payment forms including cash and checks.

26,MA,S&P; ends string of losses on tech rebound,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 index rose on Wednesday, snapping a seven-day losing streak, but worries about the economy kept investors jittery and trading volatile.  Trading was the busiest since mid-March, with more than 10 billion shares changing hands as the S&P dipped to a new low for 2011 before storming back to finish higher.  Technology shares gained after days of hefty selling that briefly pushed the Nasdaq into negative territory for 2011 before the composite index ended with solid gains.  But many investors view the gains as a short-term rebound after the S&P’s 6.8 percent decline over the past seven days.  “We are not in a bear market psychology yet, but we are definitely in a solid correction psychology,” said James Dailey, portfolio manager of Team Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.  Recent poor figures on consumer spending and factory activity underline the economy’s precarious position after a weak first half of the year. That, along with the festering European debt crisis, is likely to keep buyers cautious.  “The events in Europe and the U.S. debt ceiling issues that have been overshadowing the weak underlying fundamentals are gone now and investors are starting to realize that we are not in a good situation,” Dailey said.  The S&P technology index .GSPT was up 1.2 percent while energy stocks were the hardest hit. The S&P energy sector .GSPE fell 0.6 percent.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 29.82 points, or 0.25 percent, at 11,896.44. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 6.29 points, or 0.50 percent, at 1,260.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 23.83 points, or 0.89 percent, at 2,693.07.  Helping the Nasdaq, Research In Motion RIM.TORIMM.O shares rose 4.9 percent to $25.33 after unveiling two new and powerful versions of its touchscreen BlackBerry Torch, including an all-touch model, as it seeks to regain ground lost to Apple and Google.  MasterCard Inc (MA.N) shares also jumped 13.4 percent to $338.47 after the company reported second-quarter profit that rose 33 percent.  Traders said some buyers came into the market after comments from former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, who told the Wall Street Journal the Fed could consider a new round of stimulus to help the economy.  Driving the early losses was data showing the pace of growth in the U.S. services sector fell in July to its lowest since February 2010, while new U.S. factory orders fell in June, pulled down by weak demand for transportation equipment.  The news followed weaker-than-expected manufacturing data earlier this week, creating more angst about a pullback in the recovery.

28,MA,MasterCard profit jumps 33 percent,"CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc said second-quarter profit jumped 33 percent, as inflation in the United States lifted spending volume and more international consumers used debit and credit cards.  Shares rose as much as 10.9 percent.  The credit- and debit-card processor said signing up two big banks — SunTrust Banks Inc and Banco Santander SA U.S. affiliate Sovereign Bank — to offer MasterCard debit cards helped boost revenue in the second quarter, and should help next quarter too. The two banks had previously offered Visa Inc debit cards.  MasterCard executives told analysts on a conference call that the company benefited from overseas customers using debit and credit cards instead of cash to make payments, a long-term trend.  Spending over the MasterCard payments network also increased because of rising prices in the United States for gasoline and other goods, even though the broader economy has stayed sluggish.  U.S. economic weakness is now translating to slowing inflation or even deflation, which could cut into the dollar size of transactions that MasterCard processes in the coming quarters. But analysts said the company’s expanding international business can offset any domestic slowdown.  “They’re getting strength from other areas,” said Shannon Stemm, a financial services analyst with Edward Jones.  Purchase, New York-based MasterCard on Wednesday reported second-quarter net income of $608 million or $4.76 per share, up from $458 million, or $3.49 per share, a year earlier.  Analysts had expected $4.23 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Visa also beat analysts’ expectations when it reported quarterly results last week.  MasterCard executives said they would alter their U.S. debit interchange fee structure in advance of new industry fee caps being imposed on those charges later this year.  The fees are charged to merchants for processing customers’ debit card transactions. The so-called Durbin amendment to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law placed a cap on those fees which takes effect later this year.  MasterCard’s U.S. market chief Chris McWilton said the company would institute a two-tiered fee structure by October 1, with fees varying according to the size of the merchant. McWilton did not comment on how the new system relates to the Durbin amendment, or how it would affect revenue.  Last week, Visa said it would introduce a flat network participation fee, and lowered the per-transaction rate for processing all U.S. transactions.  MasterCard’s U.S. payment volumes were boosted by a spike in food and energy prices that fanned inflation earlier in the year, undercutting consumer spending and economic growth. But with gasoline prices off their peak of $4.02 a gallon in early May, inflation pressures are subsiding.  Consumer prices fell 0.2 percent in June, the largest drop in a year. Economists expect prices to moderate further in the months ahead amid sluggish demand.  MasterCard’s revenue increased 22 percent to $1.7 billion as its cross-border and overseas business grew.  Overall, MasterCard’s cross-border transactions rose 19.3 percent, and processed transactions increased 17.4 percent.  The company said it also gained from new processing business in the Netherlands and Brazil.  Total operating expenses increased 20 percent to $782 million. MasterCard said the rise was due to higher personnel costs related to acquisitions.  MasterCard shares were up 10.1 percent at $328.75 on Wednesday afternoon, off a new year-high hit earlier of $331.12.

Two key rating agencies confirmed the United States’ triple-A rating on Tuesday after Washington struck a last-minute deal to avoid a debt default, but threats of future downgrades remained.  “We had a complete repricing of the global equity markets, and investors have begun to look again and see whether at these levels it’s worth considering not just the negative effects the deleveraging of the government has created but what could be positive effects as well,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in New York.  “People are groping here ... at these levels we maybe overreacted a little bit to what has gone on in Washington and around the world.”  Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings maintained the top U.S. rating for now, but said more deficit-reduction measures were needed to put the nation’s finances in order and retain the rating.  Underscoring the threat, Moody’s assigned a negative outlook to its Aaa rating, which means a downgrade is possible in the next 12 months to 18 months.

34,MA,"US gasoline demand dips on prices, economy-MasterCard"," NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Reuters) - U.S. retail gasoline demand fell last week as high prices and economic uncertainty kept drivers off the road, MasterCard said in its SpendingPulse report on Tuesday.  Average gasoline demand in the week to Aug. 5 dropped 3.3 percent year-on-year and declined 1.8 percent versus the previous week, the report said.  Over the latest four weeks, average U.S. gasoline consumption fell 2.2 percent from year-earlier levels, marking the 20th straight decline for the four-week average.  Four-week average gasoline demand posted its lowest monthly figure in July since MasterCard started publicizing its findings in 2005.  The average price of a gallon of gasoline stayed flat at $3.70 last week compared with the previous week, although prices were about 34.5 percent higher than a year earlier.  MasterCard Advisors, a unit of MasterCard Inc (MA.N), estimates retail gasoline demand based on aggregate sales in the MasterCard payments system coupled with estimates for other payment forms including cash and checks.

35,MA,"Dealtalk: Undervalued, NetSpend may be scooped up","BANGALORE (Reuters) - Less than a year since it went public, NetSpend Holdings Inc’s depressed stock price and cut-throat competition in the pre-paid debit card market make it a potential takeout target.  Pre-paid cards — targeted at low income and under-banked customers — grew significantly during the economic downturn, but the card market is now over-crowded and has attracted regulatory scrutiny, priming the sector for consolidation.  Credit card giant American Express and payment processor MasterCard have both entered the pre-paid debit card space, and other financial companies are taking a close look, hoping to tap a broad source of fee-income, but making competition tougher.  Shares in NetSpend, which has lost some distribution partners and seen slower take-up of its cards, have spent most of the past six months below its $204 million October IPO price of $11. The stock price this month dipped below $4 to a life-low.  “NetSpend could be a strategic fit for other card companies, a direct competitor, or even private equity,” said Sterne Agee analyst Greg Smith.  The likeliest buyer is Green Dot Corp, NetSpend’s main rival in a U.S. pre-paid debit card market that Mercator Advisory Group forecasts will next year have funds of $118.5 billion — more than treble the 2010 total.  MasterCard recently forecast pre-paid volumes would top $840 billion by 2017.  “Green Dot would be a usual suspect here. I don’t see any reason why these companies should butt heads instead of getting together,” said Darren Chervitz, director of research at Jacob Asset Management, and a former holder of NetSpend stock.  While Green Dot has been insulated from some of the fierce competition due to its relationship with Wal-Mart — which brings in nearly two-thirds of its revenue — the same tie-up also makes it highly dependent on a single customer.  “You have to wonder if that’s a long-term relationship you really want to tie your horse to because, clearly, Walmart has the leverage in that relationship,” Chervitz said.  NetSpend has had some challenges retaining partners, but it does have a more diverse client base. Its largest client, ACE Cash Express, accounted for just a third of its 2010 revenue of $275 million.  “Green Dot is in a position to do a very accretive acquisition given where NetSpend is right now,” said Wedbush analyst Gil Luria said, noting the market is pricing in a possible buy-out of NetSpend.  “The stock has been volatile and, on the days it’s up, it’s my view that people bid it up because they feel the company is going to get sold,” Luria said.  NetSpend may also attract interest from Capital One, which tried to buy the company four years ago, Luria said.  NetSpend’s cheap stock valuation — it trades at 12 times forecast 2012 earnings, compared with 20 times for Green Dot — is likely to attract buyers, but the company may struggle to get what it thinks is the right price.  “I don’t think management would be interested in anything less than a 30-40 percent premium to even get the conversation started,” said Luria at Wedbush.  But the headwinds the company faces may leave it with few bargaining chips, and, while Green Dot’s market value is more than triple NetSpend’s, it’s unlikely to want to offer a big premium.  “I don’t think they’re (NetSpend) in a position to demand too much,” said Chervitz. “If you assume a 20-30 percent premium, you’re starting to come to a comparable valuation, which is like a merger of equals. I’m not sure that’s something Green Dot would want to do.”  If a deal gets done, it could signal a slowdown in growth for the pre-paid card sector as a whole.  “If you saw a deal happen, it’s not a bullish thing,” said Chervitz. “It probably says Green Dot is seeing some of the stress that NetSpend has seen, and sees the need to build up scale inorganically.”  ",8232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-dealtalk-netspend/dealtalk-undervalued-netspend-may-be-scooped-up-idUSTRE77M5AW20110823

Marshall’s appointment expands the Birmingham, Alabama-based bank’s board to 15 members. She was not immediately assigned to any board committees.

Demand rose 1.3 percent in the week to Aug. 26 compared with a year earlier, largely because of strong consumption related to the hurricane on the East Coast, MasterCard said.  Compared to the previous week, demand rose 2.5 percent.  The average price of gasoline at the pump last week fell a cent from the week before to $3.58 a gallon, MasterCard said.  “Prices at the pump are starting to level off as oil prices in the commodity markets have remained relatively steady,” MasterCard gasoline analyst John Gamel said in a note.  The four-week average for demand fell 2.7 percent compared with the same period a year earlier.

39,MA,"Heartland Payment sees growth in market share, margins","(Reuters) - Payment processor Heartland Payment Systems Inc HPY.N sees scope for growing its market share and margins at a time when the sluggish U.S. economy is expected to hurt its larger rivals.  The company, which competes with JPMorgan Chase’s (JPM.N) Chase Paymentech, KKR’s (KKR.N) First Data and Global Payments (GPN.N), caters mainly to small and mid-size merchants, who are doing better even as larger retail chains struggle with a cutback in consumer spending.  “Our business model allows us to make money at pricing levels that we think are challenging to some of our competitors,” said Heartland’s President Robert Baldwin in an interview with Reuters.  “We win some, they win some ... but we think we can take market share from them. Even modest moves in market share are very meaningful to us,” added Baldwin, whose responsibilities cover Heartland’s operations, administrative activities and internal controls.  While the weak U.S. market has forced payment processors to look abroad for growth opportunities and possible acquisitions, Baldwin said Heartland, which has operations in the United States and Canada, has no immediate plans of entering newer markets.  “There’s a ton of opportunity in the United States, and we want to focus on establishing a better share here.”  Heartland’s stock has grown 36 percent over the past one year, outperforming the broader S&P 1500 Data Processing & Outsources Services Sub-Industry Index .15GSPTKDP, which has risen 18 percent in the same period.  Stanford alumnus Baldwin, who served as Heartland’s chief financial officer for over a decade from 2000 to 2011, also said he sees the company’s margins growing over the next few quarters.  “We know we’ll achieve some more savings in the processing and servicing line because of the processing center consolidations that we still have under way, and the remainder is likely to come from our restraint in the G&A line item,” he said.  On a post-earnings call in August, the company said it hoped to complete its transition from 12 centers to 3 centers by mid-2012.  Heartland, which is expected to pass on benefits from lower debit interchange rules to its merchants, should also see better merchant retention in 2011 compared with last year, Baldwin said.  “Merchant retention has been trending better modestly over the last year, basically driven by the fact that we have fewer businesses going out of business,” he added.  On the proposed debit interchange rules, Baldwin said the company would see a lower cost from the reduced interchange, which it would pass on to its merchants, but it was too early to predict the exact outcome and benefits for the company.  Heartland Payment, which was the target of a massive cyber hacking attack in 2008, said issues from the data breach were largely behind them.  The data theft resulted in several lawsuits, including some from major card companies like Visa (V.N), MasterCard (MA.N), American Express (AXP.N) and Discover Financial (DFS.N).  “It’s absolutely way (behind) in our rearview mirror and we feel very good about the future,” Baldwin said.  “There are some things that could reemerge in the future but right now they’re very very quiet.”  ",9212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-heartlandpayment/heartland-payment-sees-growth-in-market-share-margins-idUSTRE78K65R20110921
40,MA,Discover Financial beats profit estimates,"(Reuters) - Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) reported higher quarterly profit, topping analysts’ estimates, on increased credit card spending by customers and lower costs for bad loans.  Net income rose to $649 million in the third quarter that ended August 31, from $261 million a year earlier, the Riverwoods, Illinois-based credit card company said on Thursday.  Earnings per share were $1.18, beating analysts’ average estimate of 96 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Discover stock slipped nine cents to close at $25.25 on a day when many financial stocks were down sharply.  “We achieved record results again this quarter as a result of further improvements in credit performance and record sales volume,” Chairman and Chief Executive David Nelms said in the announcement.  The delinquency rate for credit card loans over 30 days past due fell to a new low for the company of 2.43 percent, down from 2.79 percent in the second quarter and 4.39 percent a year earlier.  With the improvement in delinquencies, the company’s expenses for loan losses fell to $100 million, down 86 percent from $713 million a year earlier.  Discover reduced its reserve for credit losses by $359 million in the latest quarter, compared with $187 million a year earlier.  But the boosts from reserve releases are going to fade, executives cautioned after the announcement.  “We believe we have reached the end of the really large reserve releases like the one we had this quarter and the last few quarters,” Nelms said in an interview.  Nelms said that delinquency rates are unlikely to fall much further from their current record lows and that the company will have to make new provisions for losses as its makes new loans.  As a result, Discover will probably start building its loss reserves again in 2012, Chief Financial Officer Mark Graf said on a conference call with analysts.  The shift could be a bad, but inevitable, sign for future earnings reports from banks in general. Bank profits have been lifted for several quarters by reserve releases, which essentially reversed what proved to be excess expenses recorded for bad loans during the recession.  Nelms told Reuters the timing for the end of releases at other lenders will likely vary because of their different mixes of loans. Discover lends mostly on credit cards.  The trailing off of the accounting lift will put more pressure on financial firms to increase their businesses profitably, which is what Discover did in the third quarter. Sales on its credit cards increased 9 percent from a year earlier to $26.3 billion and were up from $24.8 billion in the second quarter.  The company said card volume rose because increased spending by new and existing customers and higher gas prices.  Interest yield on card accounts slipped 0.4 percentage points from a year earlier to 12.46 percent because of new restrictions from federal CARD Act, an increase in promotional rates and the fact that more customers are paying their balances in full.  Graf said the company’s profits from interest will benefit from a “tailwind” of lower funding costs in 2012 as it replaces deposits taken two or three years ago with new deposits at lower current rates.  Discover said it bought back 8.4 million of its shares, or 1.5 percent, in the third quarter for $198 million.  Through Wednesday, the company’s shares were up more than 36 percent this year.

42,MA,"Insight: China's e-payment booms, foreigners get the boot","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Use your fingerprint to buy a bowl of noodles for half off at 10 yuan ($1.60).  It was a proposition attractive enough to send Su Weiting out of the Shanghai noodle shop where she was getting lunch and around the corner to sign up for an account with yet another payment service provider, Live By Touch.  “When I used to buy something that costs over a thousand yuan, I would have to take a wallet bursting of cash,” said Su as she finally settled down with her noodles. “Using a bank card made things much easier. Now I don’t even need that. I can leave home without anything and bring things home.”  As consumption booms, especially through the Internet, China’s electronic payment service industry has taken off. With credit and debit cards, prepaid cards, mobile payments, online payments, and now biometric payments, dozens of companies are vying for a part of the fast growing pie.  It’s a cut-throat industry where deep discounts, presents, and points are luring new clients. Live By Touch, a small player so far operating only in Shanghai, links clients’ fingerprints with their bank accounts — call it the new Midas touch.  Last year, transactions through online payment companies, the PayPals of China, passed 1 trillion yuan ($156 billion) for the first time. And by 2013, it’s expected to triple, according to research firm Analysys International.  Cards, which make up the bulk of e-payments, swiped 10.4 trillion yuan last year in retail sales, making up about 35 percent of retail spending, according to the central bank. That in a country a decade ago was mostly a cashed based society.  The numbers can make overseas investors salivate, but it looks, once again, like they could be left in the cold.  While the e-payment service industry outside of debit and credit cards had largely been unregulated, the central bank last year implemented a rule that requires third party payment service providers to get a license.  And it said companies backed by foreign money needed special approval from the State Council, which has been interpreted by some local media as a move to kick out foreign investors.  “It’s difficult to say what the government’s policy is going to be in terms of enforcement, because they haven’t really had any chances to enforce things yet,” said Dave Carini, managing director of China Maverick Research.  It’s been a sensitive topic and several companies with foreign shareholders have declined to talk.  The rule has also caused a public spat between China’s e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and its shareholders SoftBank Corp and Yahoo! Inc.  Alibaba cited the rule as a reason for transferring China’s biggest online payment company Alipay, which has nearly half of the market, to a company wholly owned by its chairman Jack Ma. Yahoo and Softbank together have a fully diluted stake of about 69 percent of Alibaba Group.  In the end, the companies agreed that Alibaba Group would receive between $2 billion and $6 billion if Alipay is sold or listed, which some analysts said short-changed Yahoo! and Softbank.  “No one would have anticipated that 15 years ago that China would be the world’s largest internet market, one of the world’s largest e-commerce markets and have 750 million, 800 million people with cell phones,” said Gary Rieschel, managing director of Qiming Venture Partners. “So a lot of the rules are reactive as opposed to prescriptive.”  On some level, it shouldn’t be a surprise that the door is now closing on foreign investors in the e-payment industry.  China, like other countries, has long sought to preserve domestic dominance in key sectors, and the financial industry has been one of them. In the credit card segment, the likes of Visa Inc and MasterCard have long been barred from entering the domestic yuan card market despite China’s pledge to the WTO to open the payment service market by the end of 2006.  Earlier this year, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office requested the World Trade Organization establish a dispute settlement panel in its e-payment case against China to pry open China UnionPay’s monopoly on the domestic card market.  “I’m very hopeful China will eventually open up,” said Ling Hai, MasterCard’s Greater China division president. “I can’t comment on the timing but I think that’s definitely the direction it is going.”  Former U.S. Congressman and former WTO judge James Bacchus, said he believes the United States will win the case, and that China will have to implement the rulings or face possible economic sanctions.  “I think (the plaintiff countries) would be likely to act on this threat of economic sanctions if China did not comply because of the stakes in this particular case,” said Bacchus.  “It is certainly not in the interest of the United States or China’s other trading partners to allow China to allow China UnionPay to develop its own monopoly perch here in China and then use that to secure market access overseas.”  The WTO case against China comes as UnionPay steps up its efforts to chip away at Visa and MasterCard’s global market.  The Chinese card mammoth is already in over 110 countries and claims to be the third most used card in terms of transaction amount. And footloose Chinese travelers, most of them carrying a UnionPay card, are speeding things up.  UnionPay, majority owned by China’s Big Four lenders, had more than 1.4 billion debit cards in circulation last year and was valued at around $11.3 billion in July.  “Last year their transaction volume overseas increased about 47 percent, so they’re making a lot of headway internationally,” said Ben Cavender, associate principal of retail consulting firm China Market Research Group.  “If you look at Harrods in the UK, they installed UnionPay pay points.

44,MA,Analysis: U.S. consumers get swiped in debit fee crackdown,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A government crackdown on debit card “swipe fees” is unlikely to benefit consumers’ wallets, as banks seek makeup fees and retailers take the savings down to their own bottom line.  For months, retailers, card network companies and big banks brawled in Washington over the fees and even launched nationwide advertising campaigns. Consumers were often portrayed by retailers as the ones victimized by the billions of dollars in debit card processing fees that banks charge merchants.  On the eve of the mandated lower fees, it appears the skeptics who feared the measure would backfire on consumers were correct.  Bank of America said on Thursday it plans to charge customers who use their debit cards to make purchases a $5 monthly fee.  Representative Barney Frank, co-author of last year’s Dodd-Frank financial oversight law, said he opposed including the crackdown in the legislation.  He said in an interview with Reuters on Friday that shoppers are unlikely to benefit.  “I regard this as mostly a dispute between two groups of businesses, banks and retailers, and the consumer gets squeezed,” Frank said. “The banks will charge you more, and I don’t think the retailers are going to charge you less, which is why I didn’t want to put it in the first place.”  Some retailers are not shy about plans to pocket the savings.  Dave Ratner, founder of Dave’s Soda & Pet City chain in Massachusetts, said he will save thousands of dollars annually on swipe fees. Nearly 2 percent of his revenue currently goes to banks for debit and credit card swipe fees.  “This is just a huge relief and is getting back what is mine anyway,” said Ratner, who noted that merchants have been powerless to negotiate processing fees with banks until now.  “My customers would laugh at me if I said, ‘We are going to give you a dime off if you use a debit card.’”  Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, led the charge to include the swipe fee limits in Dodd-Frank. He has maintained that the legislation will decrease prices for consumers and help small merchants struggling to meet processing fees that amount to about 400 percent of the processing cost.  Dodd-Frank called on the Federal Reserve to craft the limits, which set the stage for a massive lobbying campaign. Banks and card network companies tried to get the cap set as high as possible, while retailers pressed for a low cap.  The Fed capped “interchange fees” at an average of 24 cents per debit card purchase. The current average fee is 44 cents on a typical debit card purchase of $38.  That translates into a $6.6 billion annual hit to financial firms, according to an August study by Javelin Strategy and Research.  Javelin also noted that seven of the top 10 banks had announced plans to eliminate free checking and the so-called Durbin amendment has banks rethinking their customer services.  The writing was on the wall for consumers. A November 2009 report from the Government Accountability Office found that limiting swipe fees would be good for retailers but not necessarily for consumers.  The independent congressional watchdog found that it would be difficult to tell whether retailers were passing along any savings to consumers, and that consumers may face higher card use costs as banks made up for lost income.  “If you are a consumer, and you are caught in the middle of this, you are going to end up having to pay more as a result of this sloppy legislation for a debit card,” said Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments Coalition, which represents card networks Visa, MasterCard, and several large banks.  Retail trade groups are steadfast that the windfall for them will not necessarily be a loss for customers.  Mallory Duncan, senior vice president of the National Retail Federation, said merchants will likely pass on savings because their industry is so competitive.  “The average net profit margin in the retail industry is approximately 2 percent,” said Duncan. “This reduction (in swipe fees) is another tool they can use to compete for customers.”  Dave Koenig, a director at the National Restaurant Association, agrees. “We do think that ultimately the consumer will get a reduction in prices just because of the competitive nature of the industry.”  A recent survey from Direct Response Forum, an annual meeting of payment professionals, provided a different assessment.  Its survey of 169 retail executives found that 41 percent of merchants said they won’t pass on the savings, and 56 percent weren’t sure.  Durbin is standing by the fee limits. He issued a statement on Thursday blasting Bank of America and touting the benefits of the rules once they go into effect on October 1.  “Small business and merchants will benefit from fee relief and consumers will benefit from lower prices,” Durbin said. “And banks that try to make up their excess profits off the backs of their customers will finally learn how a competitive market works.”  ",9302011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-financial-regulation-debit/analysis-u-s-consumers-get-swiped-in-debit-fee-crackdown-idUSTRE78T50O20110930

46,MA,UAE's Etisalat unveils pay-by-phone system,"DUBAI, Oct 11 (Reuters) - UAE telecoms operator Etisalat  on Tuesday unveiled the Middle East’s first pay-by-phone system, a move the former monopoly hopes will boost customer loyalty as it tries to arrest falling subscriber market share. Etisalat has teamed up with MasterCard to offer PayPass, an in-phone pre-paid debit card, on handsets. This is based on near-field communication (NFC) technology and will enable customers to use their mobile phone to make payments for goods and services costing $50 or less, pending approval from the UAE banking and telecoms regulators. Etisalat predicts it will launch the service before year-end. “Hopefully, by adding services, especially financial services, this is an application that our subscribers will appreciate and stay with us,” Enrique Beza, Etisalat senior manager for M-commerce, told reporters at a conference in Dubai. Rival carrier du now claims a 44 percent share of the UAE’s mobile subscribers, having launched services in 2007, and both operators are pushing smart phones to boost data revenues and offset flagging voice margins. Etisalat is promoting PayPass on Research in Motion’s  BlackBerry Bold 9900 device, although it will also become available on other smart phones. The operator plans to extend PayPass so that subscribers can link it to their bank account or credit card, but this will not be available until at least 2012.",10112011,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5E7LB2WI20111011

51,MA,Top banks accused of colluding on ATM fees,"(Reuters) - A New Jersey man sued Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo on Wednesday on behalf of ATM users, accusing the banks of colluding to fix the fees they charge customers to withdraw money. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., is the third such suit seeking class action status on the issue of automated teller machine fees in the past week. The latest suit alleges the banks worked with Visa and MasterCard to set artificially high rates on ATM fees. The earlier lawsuits were filed against Visa and MasterCard, Wednesday’s lawsuit is directed at both the card network firms and the banks. Customers who use ATMs not operated by their bank are often charged both by the operating bank and by their own bank, as a “foreign ATM transaction” fee. Successful ATM operators need access to the Visa and MasterCard networks, since the vast majority of debit cards are exclusive to them. Some cards can access alternate, cheaper networks. The lawsuits accuse Visa and MasterCard of forcing ATM operators to charge the same access fee to customers regardless of which network they use, in order to get access to the Visa and MasterCard networks. One of the other lawsuits was filed by a group representing the operators of ATMs. Wednesday’s lawsuit accused the banks, that collect the access fees, of colluding with Visa and MasterCard in setting the transaction price. A spokesman for JPMorgan declined comment. Representatives for Bank of America and Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

After releasing tens of thousands of confidential U.S. government cables, WikiLeaks needs $3.5 million over the next year to continue operating, Assange said. Visa and MasterCard stopped processing donations for WikiLeaks in December 2010 after the United States criticized the organization’s release of thousands of sensitive U.S. diplomatic cables from its embassies all over the world. In the 24 hours before credit card donations were blocked, the organization said it had received $135,000. Now, it is receiving on average about 7,000 euros ($9,700)a month. Assange said there were no lawful grounds for the blockade by Bank of America Corp, Visa Inc, MasterCard Inc, eBay Inc unit PayPal and Western Union Co, which he said had cost Wikileaks 95 percent of its revenue. “If WikiLeaks does not find a way to remove this blockade, given our current levels of expenditure, we will simply not be able to continue by the turn of the year,” Assange told a news conference. In July, WikiLeaks filed a complaint to the Directorate-General for Competition of the European Commission, saying Visa and MasterCard had breached antitrust provisions set out by the EU Treaty. Assange, who is fighting extradition from Britain to Sweden, where he faces allegations of sexual misconduct, said he hoped the European Commission would make a decision to hold a full investigation by mid-November. In interviews last year, Assange said WikiLeaks had extensive internal documents from a bank, believed to be Bank of America, an announcement that knocked 3 percent off the value of the bank’s shares. However, on Monday he said this data was now out of WikiLeaks’ hands and in the possession of an unnamed suspended WikiLeaks employee. “At this stage, we do not believe, unfortunately, that we will regain that material, which is a great loss,” he said. Daniel Domscheit-Berg, who last year was fired by Assange as WikiLeaks’ co-spokesman, told Reuters in August that he had destroyed about 3,000 submissions that WikiLeaks had received relating to Bank of America.

55,MA,MasterCard hits all-time high on strong growth,"(Reuters) - MasterCard Inc reported sharply higher third-quarter profit on Wednesday, easily beating Wall Street estimates on double-digit increases in volumes. The company’s chief executive also said on a conference call with analysts that consumers were still spending despite economic uncertainty, though growth comparisons will start to get harder from this month. MasterCard shares hit an all-time high in morning trading before giving up some gains, though they were still up 7.8 percent at $360.41 as of late morning. With those gains, the stock is up 61 percent for the year, against a 32 percent gain for competitor Visa and a 2 percent decline for the S&P; 500 Index. “We would expect strength in shares and outperformance over the near-term,” Barclays Capital analyst Darrin Peller said in a note, adding that MasterCard has actually underperformed the S&P; 500 over the last month. The company has increased efforts to poach U.S. business from Visa, just as Visa is expanding its international business. Within the last year, MasterCard has signed contracts with banks including SunTrust Banks Inc to process card transactions, gaining clients that once worked with Visa. MasterCard said on Wednesday it is also having some success internationally, with growth in transaction processing in Brazil and the Netherlands contributing to results and an expansion in Italy on the horizon. “We have really not seen any significant impact in Europe, given what’s going on there, from an economic point of view,” Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said on the conference call. The Purchase, New York-based card processing company reported net income of $716 million, or $5.63 per share, up from $519 million or $3.94 per share a year before. Net income attributable to the company was $717 million, versus $518 million a year earlier. Revenue rose more than 27 percent to $1.8 billion. Analysts had estimated MasterCard would earn $4.82 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was the company’s biggest earnings beat in the last two years, according to Thomson Reuters data. MasterCard said gross dollar volume rose 18.1 percent, while transactions processed rose 20.5 percent. For the rest of the year, MasterCard said its outlook is consistent with the guidance it gave at its investor day in September. It also maintained its long-term targets. The company said it bought back $77 million worth of stock in the third quarter and has bought back another $3 million already in the current quarter, leaving $879 million left under its current program.

56,MA,US STOCKS-Wall St on edge over Greece but Bernanke soothes,"* Fed monitoring Europe, prepared to act on economy * U.S. private employers add more jobs than expected-ADP * MasterCard profit tops view as revs jump 27 pct * Indexes up: Dow 1.5 pct, S&P; 1.6 pct, Nasdaq 1.3 pct By Edward Krudy NEW YORK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded from two days of sharp losses on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve said it is prepared to do more for the economy if conditions warrant, helping to stanch the panicky reaction to Europe’s debt crisis. Trading volume was light, however, possibly signaling that worries about Greece hold greater sway than the Fed at this time. Investors sold heavily this week after Greece said it would hold a referendum on an EU bailout crucial to stabilizing the euro zone’s financial system. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. central bank was closely monitoring developments in Europe and left open the possibility that the Fed could expand its holdings of mortgage debt if U.S. economic conditions worsened. “Bernanke was clear that they were prepared to do more, that they have the tools to do more,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York. “We remain in a very volatile situation.” The energy and financial sectors were among the strongest performers on Wednesday after having led the market lower in the previous two sessions. Some 7.4 billion shares were traded on the NYSE, the Amex and Nasdaq, which was more than 10 percent below the 20-day moving average and well below Tuesday’s high volume selloff when over 10 billion shares changed hands. “There’s no volume, which means there’s no conviction in the move; the market remains 100 percent “macro” driven, and any news out of Europe could still shift markets,” said Eric Lichtenstein, managing director at Knight Capital in Jersey City, New Jersey, The Dow Jones industrial average rose 178.08 points, or 1.53 percent, at 11,836.04. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 19.62 points, or 1.61 percent, at 1,237.90. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 33.02 points, or 1.27 percent, at 2,639.98. Also helping Wednesday’s market gains, data showed U.S. private employers added more jobs than expected last month, continuing a recent pattern of better-than-expected economic data. Conditions in Europe remained a wildcard as sources told Reuters the EU and IMF will not release an 8 billion euro payment to Greece until after the country has held its referendum, which could happen in December. Among advancing stocks, Citigroup Inc gained 2.3 percent to $29.83 and JPMorgan Chase & Co added 2.8 percent to $33.64. The KBW Bank index climbed 3.3 percent.

The Fed left interest-rate policy on hold and offered a moderately brighter economic outlook but flagged risks to growth that appeared to leave open the door for further easing. “It’s good news in the sense they are acknowledging there is some marginal improvement in the economy here right now,” said Karl Mills, president of Jurika, Mills & Keifer Investment Partners in Oakland, California. “There didn’t seem to be any reason for (additional easing) other than to say we are there with the fire hose of last resort and we will do whatever we need to do support the economy ultimately.” Mills said investors will focus on the G20 meeting in France and the effort to contain Greece’s debt crisis. Europe’s financial condition was a wild card for markets as Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou was to meet French and German leaders to discuss the implementation of the bailout for Greece. Papandreou’s call for a Greek referendum on the $178 billion bailout package, now endorsed by his cabinet, sent stocks and the euro tumbling on Tuesday. Data earlier on Wednesday showed U.S. private employers added more jobs than expected last month. A separate report showed layoffs planned by companies dropped sharply, bolstering the view that the economy is on a path of slow growth. The energy and financial sectors were among the best performers on Wednesday after having led the market lower in the previous two sessions. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 142.55 points, or 1.22 percent, to 11,800.51. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 14.40 points, or 1.18 percent, to 1,232.68.

French and German leaders will aim to push for quick implementation of the Greek bailout deal after the Athens government unsettled global markets by calling for a referendum on an agreement reached last week. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou won the backing of his cabinet to hold the referendum. Papandreou’s referendum call triggered a slide in global stocks. The U.S. benchmark S&P; 500 index fell 5.2 percent over the past two sessions, even as it closed its best month in 20 years on Monday. The expected advance in equities is a response to the steep decline after Greece’s proposal, according to Peter Jankovskis co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. He said that with the plan backed by the Greek cabinet, it “could be a sign (Papandreou) knows what he’s doing.” Futures added to gains after a report showed U.S. private employers added more jobs than expected last month and the September figure was revised higher. “It is not a huge amount better, but the fact that it was better than expected and there was a revision in the last month’s number is a pretty encouraging sign,” said Jankovskis. S&P; 500 futures rose 5.5 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration of the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures gained 49 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 9.75 points. The Fed looked set to take a breather from monetary stimulus measures, even if market turbulence heightens the chances of action later.

The world’s second-largest credit and debit card processing network said it incurred a $495 million after-tax charge related to merchant litigations in the United States over the fees they pay on credit card transactions. The company, however, doesn’t expect to see any significant or long-term impact on its interchange fees with regard to the settlement with merchants, Chief Executive Ajay Banga said on a post earnings conference call. Retailers — including D’Agostino Supermarkets Inc and Payless ShoeSource — allege that companies like MasterCard, Visa and others violate anti-trust regulations by fixing the stores’ fees for processing their payment cards. The lawsuit alleges that rules preventing stores from offering customers discounts for paying in cash or steering them toward less costly forms of payment, such as cash or competitors’ cards, are costing merchants an estimated $50 billion each year. Analysts, however, are not overly perturbed by this litigation charge. “The litigation charge was lower than expected and even if the charge increases, the company has $4.9 billion in cash, so it would be manageable,” Evercore analyst David Togut told Reuters. Continuing economic uncertainty in Europe has led to a decline in consumer sentiment in the region, MasterCard said. However, it continues to see growth in the northern and eastern parts of Europe. “We could see a slowdown in Europe as far as the company is concerned, but it wouldn’t affect them materially as we are seeing an increasing shift in payment mode from cash to electronic,” Guggenheim Securities analyst David Darst told Reuters. The company forecast a net revenue growth of 12 to 14 percent on a constant currency basis for 2011 to 2013 and said any negative impact from the litigation settlement is included in its forecast. For the fourth quarter, the company which competes with Visa and American Express, posted a net income of $19 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with $415 million or $3.16 a share last year. Total revenue was $1.72 billion, up 20 percent. Excluding items, the company posted a net income of $514 million, or $4.03 a share. Analysts had expected the company to earn $3.91 a share on  revenue of $1.72 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Cross-border transcation volume for the fourth quarter rose 17.5 percent, while processed transactions grew 23 percent to 7.7. billion. Excluding the charge, operating expense grew 11.5 percent to $968 million, from the previous year. Earlier in the month, American Express posted a higher quarterly profit on higher cardholder spending and a slower growth in expenses, and set aside more money to cover bad loans. Visa is expected to report fourth quarter results next week.

Retail gasoline demand rose by 3.4 percent in the week to Feb. 17, compared with the previous week, even as the average price of gasoline rose by 3 cents a gallon to $3.53, MasterCard data showed. The Presidents Day holiday on Monday led to the surge in gasoline consumption as motorists prepared to travel for the long weekend, according to John Gamel, gasoline analyst with MasterCard. “We saw this last year as well - in fact the week-to-week increase was slightly higher,” Gamel added. Demand grew by 4.5 percent week-on-week on the period before the Presidents Day holiday, MasterCard data shows. However, demand was 6.4 percent lower than a year ago as pump prices held 12.1 percent above levels seen in the same period in 2011. “There was some sluggishness in New England and Central Atlantic but this might be a post Super Bowl effect,” Gamel said.

78,MA,MasterCard sees controlled explosion in Asia plastic,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc is counting on responsible spending and rare defaults among its customers in Asia, along with a greater use of credit by the region’s young, its chief financial officer told Reuters on Wednesday. A growing middle class and rising consumption also set Asia apart from the West, the electronic payment giant’s CFO Martina Hund-Mejean said. “We are seeing a change in Asia. The older population are saving first and then they are spending. But when we do analysis on the younger population, we are seeing people using more and more of the credit line,” she said in an interview. “I sure hope that Asia doesn’t go the way that the U.S. went, where they had to learn their lesson, but I think at this point, we see responsible behaviour in Asia. It could be honour or ‘face’ that makes them not go overboard.” MasterCard (MA.N) charges fees to process card payments between the banks of merchants and buyers via its global network, its main rivals being Visa Inc (V.N) and American Express Co (AXP.N). A litigation-related charge took a large bite out of MasterCard’s fourth-quarter earnings, but it beat analysts’ estimates for the seventh straight quarter as consumers around the world used their plastic more. Asians tend to spend on items such as travel, dining and entertainment, as well as home furnishings, and this can only grow, as many of these markets are underdeveloped relative to the United States, Hund-Mejean said. “Population change, more middle class and consumption growth are big characteristics of Asia-Pacific. The other thing that I would say is the women. Women have the purse strings in many Asian countries,” she said. MasterCard has worked with banks in Asia to tailor many products for women, she said, with special cards for women and a marketing strategy to attract women from across Asia to shop at the annual Great Singapore Sale. Around 55 percent of the $37 trillion of global personal consumption spending was in cash and cheques, Hund-Mejean said, the rest being via electronic means such as credit, debit and prepaid cards. MasterCard has invested in a mobile payment technology, PayPass, that allows people to “tap and go” instead of swiping a card or providing a signature. Consumers can make purchases with a PayPass-enabled phone, card or mobile payment tag. “Cash costs society something,” she said. “You have to print it, you have to transport it, you have to count it. There’s also tax evasion.” Hund-Mejean said Asia-Pacific was likely to be MasterCard’s higher-growth region, with Singapore, Indonesia, South Korea and Australia the key drivers. But there remain some regulatory or infrastructure obstacles in the company’s path. In China, for example, MasterCard can handle only cross-border, not domestic, transactions. And some developing countries, such as Vietnam, lack the network for electronic payments. Of 36 analysts covering MasterCard stock, 26 have a “buy” or “strong buy” rating and 10 have “hold”, according to Thomson Reuters data.

83,MA,"Security breach hits U.S. card processors, banks","(Reuters) - Four giant card-payment processors and large U.S. banks that issue debit and credit cards were hit by a data-security breach after third-party services provider Global Payments Inc discovered its systems were compromised by unauthorized access. It was not immediately clear how many cardholders became victims of the breach, which affected MasterCard Inc, Visa Inc, American Express Co and Discover Financial Services, as well as banks and other franchises that issue cards bearing their logos. U.S. law enforcement authorities including the Secret Service are investigating and MasterCard said it has hired an independent data-security organization to review the incident. The shares of Atlanta-based Global Payments, which acts as a credit-checking middleman between merchants and card processors, were halted on Friday afternoon after dropping more than 9 percent on the news. MasterCard shares fell 1.8 percent to close at $420.54, Visa shares dropped 0.8 percent to $118, American Express shares fell 0.1 percent to $57.86, while Discover rose 1.2 percent to $33.34. Analysts said any financial losses from the data breach would be shouldered by merchants, card issuers and Global Payments rather than Visa or Mastercard, which operate payment networks. Global Payments said it determined that an unauthorized entity had accessed its systems and possible customer card data in early March. Krebs on Security, a blog that first reported the incident on Friday, said accounts had been compromised for over a month, between January 21, 2012 and February 25, 2012. Global Payments is holding an investor conference call Monday morning to discuss the issue. This Global Payments breach is just the latest in a long string of incidents that have put the personal information of millions of credit and debit cardholders at risk. Individual banks and processors said they had not yet determined the full extent of the breach, but Krebs on Security described it as a “massive” breach that may affect more than 10 million cardholders. Some industry experts suggested the figure might be much less, perhaps on the order of tens of thousands. Bernstein Research analyst Rod Bourgeois noted that Global Payments is a relatively small player in the transactions services industry, servicing 800,000 merchants with a 3.5 percent market share. By contrast, the largest competitor, First Data, services millions of merchants, with 22.6 percent of the market. JPMorgan Chase & Co, as well as American Express and Discover, which issue their own cards, said they are monitoring customers’ accounts and would issue new cards to anyone whose information may have been compromised. Citigroup Inc said it has been notified by processors of the breach. Bank of America Corp declined to comment on the matter and Wells Fargo & Co said it was too early to comment on the impact. Banks and processors emphasized customers would not be held liable for any fraudulent charges that may occur. Mike Simonsen, the Chief Executive of real-estate research company Altos Research, said he may have been a victim. Simonsen said he was contacted by his bank, Bank of America Corp, last week about his Visa card. Although there were no unauthorized transactions, the representative told him a vendor or law enforcement agency had flagged his account as compromised and so he would receive a new one. “It was very unusual,” he said. Global Payments, which has about 3,700 employees, was spun off from information-services firm National Data Corp in 2001. For the fiscal year ended May 31, Global Payment reported revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 13 percent from the year-earlier period. According to a company presentation in January, the company was projected to report fiscal 2012 revenue in the range of $2.15 billion. The company is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results on Wednesday and there had been the expectation Global Payments would report improving results. On Wednesday, Sterne Agee raised its price target for Global Payments to $65 a share from $58. Global Payments is one of dozens of companies that operate along the payment-processing chain, between the time a person swipes a card to pay and the time the payment is delivered. The account number, expiration date and possibly the cardholder’s name is sent from the point of payment to a processor, which then connects to Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover. Information is then sent to the card issuer — often a bank — which ultimately authorizes the transaction. The actual transfer of money occurs later. Processing companies, which perform millions of authorizations each day, are supposed to encrypt card information. But a breach could occur if someone gains access to the system and identifies a gap in the encryption. The information that was likely collected illegally from Global Payments is called Track 1 and Track 2 data. A person improperly using the information can transfer the account number and expiration date to a magnetic strip on a card and then try to use the card on a website. Thousands of U.S. banks that issue credit and debit cards receive daily alerts regarding breaches through a system referred to as CAMS, said Thomas McCrohan, an analyst with Janney Capital Markets. The illegal use of the data could be stymied if an online merchant asks for the three or four digits printed on a card known as the “CVV code.” “The systems can all be made tighter, but if they’re too tight no transactions would ever be approved,” said Edward Lawrence, a director at Auriemma Consulting Group, a payment systems consultant. “You still have to allow commerce to occur.” Rep. Mary Bono, a California Republican who chairs the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade, condemned the Global Payments breach and urged Congress to adopt stronger data-security legislation this year. “You shouldn’t have to cross your fingers and whisper a prayer when you type in a credit card number on your computer and hit ‘enter,’” she said in a statement. The Visa-Mastercard-Discover breach is the first major instance this year of consumer information put at risk by technological flaws or hacking, but there are plenty of examples of massive data breaches in recent years affecting banks, retailers, technology companies and payment processors. Last June, Citigroup said computer hackers breached the bank’s network and accessed data of about 200,000 cardholders in North America. Sony Corp also reported several recent attacks, including one last year in which hackers accessed the personal information on 77 million PlayStation Network accounts. Google Inc suffered a major attack on its Gmail accounts in 2011 that it said appeared to originate in China. Attacks against Gmail users involved direct attempts to compromise accounts by tricking users into revealing information - so-called “phishing” - or by gathering their passwords from other websites, rather than compromising Google systems, according to the company. Separately, TJX Companies Inc and Heartland Payment Systems Inc have had their systems compromised. On Friday, retailers were already beginning to look for fraudulent purchases from the compromised card accounts stemming from the Global Payments breach. They will bear the financial brunt of those crimes under rules worked out with the card associations and issuers, analysts said. “Our merchant community is sitting here girding itself and looking at their own fraud-prevention strategies and bracing for the influx of bad transactions,” said Tom Donlea, managing director for the Americas at the nonprofit Merchant Risk Council. “After Heartland and after the Sony breach, there was an increase in fraud activity.” (This version of the story corrects paragraph 29 to delete statement Google systems were compromised and adds that Gmail users were targets of a “phishing” scam) ",3302012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mastercard-breach/security-breach-hits-u-s-card-processors-banks-idUSBRE82T0VD20120330

86,MA,"Security breach hits U.S. card processors, banks","(Reuters) - The U.S. Secret Service is investigating a major cyber intrusion at an Atlanta-based payment processor that could expose millions of MasterCard, Visa, American Express and Discover cardholders to fraudulent charges. Processor Global Payments Inc said on Friday it had found “unauthorized access” into its system early in March and notified law enforcement and financial institutions. Payment network operators MasterCard Inc, Visa Inc, American Express Co and Discover Financial Services confirmed they were affected, along with banks and other franchises that issue cards bearing their logos. A spokesman for the Secret Service said the agency is leading investigations into the case but declined to give any details. Though Global Payments is far from a household name, middlemen such as the company are prized targets for hackers because of the vast amount of sensitive financial information they handle. The company’s stock fell more than 9 percent on the news before trading was halted. It said it would discuss the breach in a phone call for investors on Monday. It was not immediately clear how Global Payments was penetrated or how many accounts were exposed. Consumers who detect fraud usually can be reimbursed. That leaves merchants on the hook financially, though they could file claims against Global Payments. Analysts said MasterCard and Visa are unlikely to face costs from the breach, but MasterCard shares fell 1.8 percent to close at $420.54 and Visa shares dropped 0.8 percent to $118. The security breach is just the latest in a long string of incidents that have put the personal information of millions of credit and debit cardholders at risk. Individual banks and processors said they had not yet determined the full extent of the breach, but the blog Krebs on Security, which first reported the breach, said it was “massive” and could affect more than 10 million cardholders. Some industry experts suggested the figure might be much lower, perhaps on the order of tens of thousands. Bernstein Research analyst Rod Bourgeois noted that Global Payments is a relatively small player in the transactions services industry, servicing 800,000 merchants with a 3.5 percent market share. By contrast, the largest competitor, First Data, services millions of merchants, with 22.6 percent of the market. JPMorgan Chase & Co, as well as American Express and Discover, which issue their own cards, said they are monitoring customers’ accounts and would issue new cards to anyone whose information may have been compromised. Citigroup Inc said it has been notified by processors of the breach. Bank of America Corp declined to comment on the matter and Wells Fargo & Co said it was too early to comment on the impact. Banks and processors emphasized customers would not be held liable for any fraudulent charges that may occur. Michael Simonsen, chief executive of real-estate research company Altos Research, said he may have been a victim. Simonsen said he was contacted by Bank of America last week about his Visa card. Although there were no unauthorized transactions, the representative told him a vendor or law enforcement agency had flagged his account as compromised and so he would receive a new one. “It was very unusual,” he said. Global Payments, which has about 3,700 employees, was spun off from information-services firm National Data Corp in 2001. For the fiscal year ended May 31, Global Payment reported revenue of $1.9 billion, up 13 percent from the year-earlier period. According to a company presentation in January, it estimated fiscal 2012 revenue at about $2.15 billion. Global Payments is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results on Wednesday and an improvement is expected. On Wednesday, Sterner Agee raised its stock price target for Global Payments to $65 from $58. Global Payments is one of dozens of companies that operate along the payment-processing chain, between the time a person swipes a card to pay and the time the payment is delivered. The account number, expiration date and possibly the cardholder’s name is sent from the point of payment to a processor, which then connects to Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover. Information is then sent to the card issuer — often a bank — which ultimately authorizes the transaction. The actual transfer of money occurs later. Processing companies, which perform millions of authorizations each day, are supposed to encrypt card information. But a breach could occur if someone gains access to the system and identifies a gap in the encryption. The information that was likely collected illegally from Global Payments is called Track 1 and Track 2 data. A person improperly using the information can transfer the account number and expiration date to a magnetic strip on a card and then try to use the card on a website. Thousands of U.S. banks that issue credit and debit cards receive daily alerts regarding breaches, said Thomas McCrohan, an analyst with Jane Capital Markets. The illegal use of the data could be stymied if an online merchant asks for the three or four digits printed on a card known as the “CV code.” “The systems can all be made tighter, but if they’re too tight no transactions would ever be approved,” said Edward Lawrence, a director at Auriemma Consulting Group, a payment systems consultant. “You still have to allow commerce to occur.” Rep. Mary Bono, a California Republican who chairs the House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade, condemned the Global Payments breach and urged Congress to adopt stronger data-security legislation this year. “You shouldn’t have to cross your fingers and whisper a prayer when you type in a credit card number on your computer and hit ‘enter,’” she said in a statement. The breach is the first major instance this year of consumer information put at risk by technological flaws or hacking, but there are plenty of examples of massive data breaches in recent years affecting banks, retailers, technology companies and payment processors. Last June, Citigroup said computer hackers breached the bank’s network and accessed data of about 200,000 cardholders in North America. Sony Corp also reported several recent attacks, including one last year in which hackers accessed the personal information on 77 million PlayStation Network accounts. Google Inc suffered a major attack on its Gmail accounts in 2011 that it said appeared to originate in China. Attacks against Gmail users involved direct attempts to compromise accounts by tricking users into revealing information - so-called “phishing” - or by gathering their passwords from other websites, rather than compromising Google systems, according to the company. Separately, TJX Co Inc and Heartland Payment Systems Inc have had their systems compromised. On Friday, retailers were already beginning to look for fraudulent purchases from the compromised card accounts stemming from the Global Payments breach. They will bear the financial brunt of those crimes under rules worked out with the card associations and issuers, analysts said. “Our merchant community is sitting here girding itself and looking at their own fraud-prevention strategies and bracing for the influx of bad transactions,” said Tom Donlea, managing director for the Americas at the nonprofit Merchant Risk Council. “After Heartland and after the Sony breach, there was an increase in fraud activity.” ",3312012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mastercard-breach/security-breach-hits-u-s-card-processors-banks-idUSBRE82T0VD20120331

92,MA,Can you have too many credit cards?,"(Reuters) - Vitaly Pecharsky, chief technology officer for the shopping site SlickDeals.net, is something of a credit card collector and has 40 active credit cards to show for his passion. “I have cards for every situation in life,” says Pecharsky, 32, who lives in Las Vegas, Nevada. His portfolio of cards - the oldest of which he’s had for 16 years - grows when there’s a credit card deal he just can’t refuse. Most recently, there was one that offered cash back on dining. He has others that give back cash for anything from gas to groceries. He estimates he gets $2,000-$3,000 a year in rewards and cash back. His strategy might be tempting at a time when card issuers are increasingly dangling reward offers. About three-quarters of all card offers in the first quarter of 2012 involved a reward program - up from 66 percent in the last quarter of 2011, according to the marketing intelligence firm Mintel Comperemedia. But, does a guy like Pecharsky - who is something of an outlier since the credit bureau Experian says consumers have an average of three cards and only 15 percent have more than seven - make credit experts cry? Not really. The key for evaluating Pecharsky’s 40 cards isn’t how many he has, but how much he spends in relation to how many cards he has (and that he has no negatives like missed payments). “You can’t have ‘too much credit,’ but you can utilize too much credit,” says Anthony Sprauve, a spokesman for FICO, the company that calculates the leading credit scores. “Credit utilization (amounts owed as a percentage of available credit) counts for 30 percent of a person’s credit score. The more of someone’s available credit they are using the bigger negative impact on their credit score.” If you have $100,000 in available credit and $10,000 charged on your cards, then you have a 10 percent utilization ratio. If you have $20,000 on them, the rate is 20 percent, and so on. For consumers with the best credit scores - at 760 or above - their average utilization rate is 7.0 percent, says John Ulzheimer, president of consumer education at SmartCredit.com, who previously worked for the credit scoring company FICO and credit bureau Equifax. You might assume that trimming off unused accounts (especially pruning multiple accounts from a big issuer like JPMorgan Chase & Co or Citigroup Inc.) would be like any other housekeeping measure - just ridding yourself of what you don’t need. But credit experts like Ulzheimer say that more is better, as long as you aren’t tempted to actually use all that borrowing power. It is the unused credit that is valuable, while overusing credit can have the opposite effect. The danger of overspending has long made it the conventional wisdom in the personal finance world to limit the number of cards you have. But David Bakke, 45, editor of the personal finance site MoneyCrashers.com, currently has eight active cards. “It surprises people that I have so many cards since there are many myths that say that simply applying or having multiple cards will hurt your credit score,” he says, but he adds, “That’s just not true.” Both Sprauve and Ulzheimer caution that if you want to embrace this philosophy of loading up on credit, going on an application binge isn’t going help. It takes time for your credit history to form. Also, applying for a series of cards one right after the other will push down your credit score, because credit applications have a negative impact. The next challenge you’ll face once you have a stack of new cards is how to keep them all active, using them at least once or twice a year. If you don’t, says Ulzheimer, “the issuer of the card actually loses money, and eventually they’re going to close your account.” Some cardholders arrange to have different bills automatically charged to their different cards every month, just to make sure their cards get some use, but that can involve a lot of bill-paying organizing, too. Fail to pay every credit card bill on time and you can end up with penalty fees and interest high enough to negate the value of those card rewards. Thanks to the 2009 federal Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure (CARD) Act, consumers no longer face inactivity fees or charges to reopen a closed card. But if you want a closed account back, you’ll have to apply for it anew - meaning a negative to your credit score because another credit report will be run. When it comes to applying for a larger loan, like a mortgage, the number of credit cards you have won’t hurt you a bit, says David Boone, first vice president and head of mortgage origination for The Provident Bank in Jersey City, New Jersey. A bigger problem is applicants who don’t have at least three “trade lines” - credit cards or auto loans - to establish a strong enough history, he says. Someone with a lot of lines and lot of available credit who has kept usage low and maintained a solid history of payment is a good candidate for a mortgage. “We do scratch our heads sometimes,” Boone says. “Why does that guy have five Visa cards from Chase?” (The author is a Reuters contributor.)

That followed a revised $9.27 billion increase in outstanding credit in February. Analysts expressed some reservations whether the date reliably signaled a real pickup in demand, something that would normally fuel stronger growth, or just a need to rely more on credit in an economy generating anemic job growth. “The optimistic read is that consumers’ improved outlook on the economy and employment prospects led them to feel comfortable spending on credit, while a more downbeat interpretation is that credit is needed for consumers to keep up,” Nomura Global Economics said in a note afterward. The March rise in consumer credit was the strongest for any month since November 2001 when it soared by $28 billion. That was shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks when big automakers were offering zero-percent financing and other incentives to lure consumers back to their showrooms. New-car sales and production were a key influence on the 2.2 percent annual rate of economic growth posted during the first three months this year. The government estimated that about half of that growth came from increased new car production. The March figures showed consumers once again expanding their credit card use after two months in which they had paid this debt. So-called revolving, or credit-card, debt rose $5.18 billion after declining by $2.35 billion in February and $2.95 billion in January. Paul Edelstein, an economist with IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts, said it might mean that consumers have now paid down debt that they accumulated over the holiday season and were ready and able to take on more, but cautioned that was not a certainty. “The bearish view is that with income growth anemic, households needed to use their credit cards to pay for higher gasoline prices in March,” he added. The main increase in March consumer credit was concentrated in non-revolving credit, a category that includes student and car loans. It climbed by $16.17 billion following a revised $11.62-billion gain in February. Concern about student loan levels has increased in an environment where newly graduating students face difficulty finding a job and keeping up with loan payments. Congress is currently considering how to prevent a low interest rate for student loans from doubling on July 1 and is expected to find a way to do so, if only to avoid irritating young voters ahead of November’s presidential elections. A scarcity of job opportunities has led more people to seek retraining at colleges and universities which has also contributed to loan demand and growth in outstanding credit. “We expect that student loan growth will continue to push the level of consumer credit outstanding higher, and we look for revolving credit to expand as banks become more willing to lend,” Barclays Bank PLC said in a statement. Last week, the Fed said in its latest report on bank lending standards that bankers had become more willing to lend and that demand for business loans had increased in the first three months of this year. That was taken as a hopeful sign for expansion because credit standards had tightened sharply after the 2007-09 recession and any loosening of standards could indicate an easier flow of credit that is vital to fuel growth.

103,MA,"MasterCard loses card fee challenge, Visa Europe next","LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Mastercard lost a challenge to an EU ban on its cross-border card fees in a ruling that puts rival Visa Europe squarely in the sights of European regulators over its charges. Europe’s second-highest court on Thursday upheld a 2007 decision by the European Commission which was triggered by retailers’ gripes about the world’s second-largest credit and debit card network. The EU competition watchdog said at the time that the network’s cross-border multilateral interchange fee (MIF), levied on retailers’ credit and debit card transactions, breached EU antitrust rules and had to be changed. The EU ban is part of the EU executive’s strategy to break down barriers to e-commerce and cut costs for businesses in the 27-member European Union. “The General Court confirms the Commission’s decision prohibiting the multilateral interchange fees applied by Mastercard,” judges at the Luxembourg-based court ruled. “The methods of setting the MIF tended to overestimate the costs borne by the financial institutions on issuing payment cards and, moreover, inadequately to assess the advantages which merchants derive from that form of payment.” MasterCard President Javier Perez said the company would appeal but would also continue to levy fees agreed with the Commission in a 2009 settlement, pending discussions with the regulator on the next step. “We will apply 20/30, which is the level we have today, until further notice,” Perez said, referring to the 0.20 percent charge for debit cards and 0.30 percent for credit cards as part of the settlement. MasterCard had said at the time of the settlement that the fees, halved from their previous level, were temporary, pending the court ruling. Appeals to the EU Court of Justice are limited to points of law. EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia welcomed the ruling and called on Visa Europe, the European licensee of Visa Inc and Europe’s largest card network, to fall into line. “The Commission invites Visa and MasterCard to consider carefully how to bring the multilateral interchange fees in the EU in line with competition,” Almunia said in a statement. Almunia told Reuters in January that he was readying formal charges against Visa Europe, but had not decided when to notify the company. The Commission is now investigating Visa Europe’s credit card fees. Visa Europe, which cut its debit card charges in December 2010 to settle the Commission’s investigation into that part of its business, said on Thursday it wanted a business-friendly method of setting fees. “Visa Europe... has consistently said that it would like to reach a commercially acceptable agreement on an appropriate methodology for setting credit and deferred debit interchange in the interests of all stakeholders in the payments industry,” spokeswoman Amanda Kamin said in a statement.

116,MA,"Visa, MasterCard edging closer to fee pact: report","(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) could reach a settlement this month in a lawsuit in which retailers accuse the payment networks of charging excessive credit card fees, Bloomberg News reported, citing people briefed on the matter. The seven-year old case in Brooklyn federal court accuses Visa and Mastercard of conspiring to raise stores’ fees for processing their payment cards. Visa, Mastercard and the banks that issue their payment cards are accused of working together to steer merchants toward certain forms of payment. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson has supervised at least three settlement conferences between the parties since December, the court docket showed. A trial is tentatively scheduled to begin in September. Spokespersons for Visa and MasterCard declined to comment on Friday. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Craig Wildfang, declined to comment. Other lawyers for the defendants either declined to comment or did not immediately return requests for comment Friday. In a June 25 analyst report, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Glenn Fodor said senior leaders from Visa and MasterCard participated in two days of settlement talks last month, a sign that Judge Gleeson is pressing for a settlement. “Our view has always been that there is a very low likelihood of this case going to trial, and these actions by the court support that view,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. Merchants who brought the lawsuit — including D’Agostino Supermarkets Inc and Payless Shoe Source — said rules that prevent them from offering discounts for paying in cash or pushing customers toward a less costly form of payment are costing stores an estimated $50 billion each year. The case raises similar claims to another consolidated set of cases in Brooklyn federal court, filed by retailers in 1996. Visa and Mastercard paid $3.05 billion to settle that case, which only covered conduct up to January 1, 2004. According to plaintiffs in the latest case, the card companies’ behavior has continued virtually unchanged since then. Merchants bringing the latest case estimate that monetary damages could run into the tens of billions of dollars — a figure that Visa and MasterCard deny. In its report, Morgan Stanley agreed with the consensus estimate that the settlement could cost about $10 billion. MasterCard would likely pay its portion over several years while Visa would be “insulated from direct economic exposure” because of a plan already in place to cover the costs of the settlement. Banks that issue credit cards could also be affected by the settlement. Interchange fees could be lowered and banks could pay penalties partly covered by the shares they received in Visa’s public stock offering, according to the report. “Any greater reduction in interchange fees or penalties is likely a negative for bank stocks, though the degree of impact will ultimately be a function of the overall terms of the settlement,” the report said.

121,MA,"Visa, MasterCard, banks in $7.25 billion retail settlement","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc, MasterCard Inc and banks that issue their credit cards have agreed to a $7.25 billion settlement with U.S. retailers in a lawsuit over the fixing of credit and debit card fees in what could be the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. The settlement, if approved by a judge, would resolve dozens of lawsuits filed by retailers in 2005. The card companies and banks would also allow stores to start charging customers extra for using certain credit cards in an effort to steer them toward cheaper forms of payment. The settlement papers were filed Friday in Brooklyn federal court. The proposal involves a payment to a class of stores of $6 billion from Visa, MasterCard and more than a dozen of the country’s largest banks who issue the companies’ cards. The card companies have also agreed to reduce swipe fees by the equivalent of 10 basis points for eight months for a total consideration to stores valued at about $1.2 billion, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs. An additional $525 million will be paid to stores suing individually, according to the documents. “This is an historic settlement,” said Bonny Sweeney, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “In addition to refunding billions of dollars to retailers that paid artificially inflated interchange fees, the reforms will create real price competition, leading to reduced card-acceptance fees for retailers.” Noah Hanft, general counsel for MasterCard, said the company believed its interests were “best served by an amicable resolution” of the case. Visa CEO Joseph Saunders said the settlement was in the best interest of all parties and did not expect the settlement to impact its current guidance. But not everyone was pleased with the proposal. One class plaintiff, the National Association of Convenience Stores, slammed the deal in a statement from its president, Tom Robinson, who is also president of Robinson Oil Corp. “Not only does the proposed settlement fail to introduce competition and transparency, it actually provides Visa and MasterCard with the tools to continue to shield swipe fees from market forces,” Robinson said. The proposed considerations are a far cry from the $50 billion in swipe-fees paid each year by U.S. retailers, he said. The American Bankers Association, a trade group whose members include the bank defendants, said retailers, not consumers, stood to gain the most from the proposed settlement. “Big-box retailers will likely seize this opportunity to ask Congress for even more handouts,” said ABA president Frank Keating in a statement, referring to the Durbin amendment passed by Congress in 2010 limiting debit-card swipe fees - a move that banks say resulted in an $8 billion windfall for retailers. “The legal process worked and should send a signal to Congress that it is wrong to pick winners and losers in a complex dispute between two industries,” the Electronic Payment Coalition, which represents payment networks, said in a statement. Stores said Visa and MasterCard colluded directly and indirectly through the issuing banks to keep merchants from finding ways to mitigate credit-card costs. Plaintiffs in the case include supermarket chain Kroger Co, pharmacy chain Rite-Aid Corp and shoe retailer Payless ShoeSource, as well as trade associations such as the National Association of Convenience Stores, National Grocers Association and the American Booksellers Association. A number of banks that issue Visa and MasterCard cards, including JP Morgan Chase & Co, were also named as defendants in the lawsuit, along with Visa and MasterCard’s payment networks. A spokeswoman for Bank of America NA said it believed the terms of the settlement were fair. JP Morgan declined to comment. Citigroup Inc acknowledged its role in the deal and declined further comment. Swipe fees are set by the card companies and deducted from the transaction by the banks that issue the cards, essentially passing on the cost to merchants, the lawsuits said. An estimated 7 million retailers will be affected by the settlement, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs. Visa and MasterCard have been plagued by legal problems over their payment-card policies for the last decade. In 2003, the companies paid a combined $3 billion to settle a lawsuit by stores over their “honor all cards” policies, which tied acceptance of credit to debit cards. The U.S. Department of Justice brought and settled a civil antitrust suit against Visa and MasterCard in 2010. As part of the consent decree, the companies agreed to drop certain policies that kept stores from steering their customers to cheaper forms of payment. But the decree left intact policies that prohibit stores from charging customers more when they use certain payment cards, according to a July 2011 court filing from plaintiffs. The defendants denied that any collusion took place. In December, Visa announced it set aside an additional $1.57 billion to cover the cost of a potential settlement in the case, bringing its litigation reserve balance to $4.28 billion, according to a regulatory filing. MasterCard in the fourth quarter of 2011 recorded a $770 million pretax charge, as an estimate of its potential liability in the case, a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed. MasterCard said in a statement that it expected to incur an additional $20 million pre-tax charge in its 2012 second quarter financial statements to cover its portion of the settlement.

122,MA,"UPDATE 2-Visa, MasterCard, banks in $7.25 bln retail settlement","By Jessica Dye NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters) - Visa Inc, MasterCard Inc  and banks that issue their credit cards have agreed to a $7.25 billion settlement with U.S. retailers in a lawsuit over the fixing of credit and debit card fees in what could be the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. The settlement, if approved by a judge, would resolve dozens of lawsuits filed by retailers in 2005. The card companies and banks would also allow stores to start charging customers extra for using certain credit cards in an effort to steer them toward cheaper forms of payment. The settlement papers were filed Friday in Brooklyn federal court. The proposal involves a payment to a class of stores of $6 billion from Visa, MasterCard and more than a dozen of the country’s largest banks who issue the companies’ cards. The card companies have also agreed to reduce swipe fees by the equivalent of 10 basis points for eight months for a total consideration to stores valued at about $1.2 billion, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs. An additional $525 million will be paid to stores suing individually, according to the documents. “This is an historic settlement,” said Bonny Sweeney, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “In addition to refunding billions of dollars to retailers that paid artificially inflated interchange fees, the reforms will create real price competition, leading to reduced card-acceptance fees for retailers.” Noah Hanft, general counsel for MasterCard, said the company believed its interests were “best served by an amicable resolution” of the case. Visa CEO Joseph Saunders said the settlement was in the best interest of all parties and did not expect the settlement to impact its current guidance. But not everyone was pleased with the proposal. One class plaintiff, the National Association of Convenience Stores, slammed the deal in a statement from its president, Tom Robinson, who is also president of Robinson Oil Corp. “Not only does the proposed settlement fail to introduce competition and transparency, it actually provides Visa and MasterCard with the tools to continue to shield swipe fees from market forces,” Robinson said. The proposed considerations are a far cry from the $50 billion in swipe-fees paid each year by U.S. retailers, he said. The American Bankers Association, a trade group whose members include the bank defendants, said retailers, not consumers, stood to gain the most from the proposed settlement. “Big-box retailers will likely seize this opportunity to ask Congress for even more handouts,” said ABA president Frank Keating in a statement, referring to the Durbin amendment passed by Congress in 2010 limiting debit-card swipe fees - a move that banks say resulted in an $8 billion windfall for retailers. “The legal process worked and should send a signal to Congress that it is wrong to pick winners and losers in a complex dispute between two industries,” the Electronic Payment Coalition, which represents payment networks, said in a statement. Stores said Visa and MasterCard colluded directly and indirectly through the issuing banks to keep merchants from finding ways to mitigate credit-card costs. Plaintiffs in the case include supermarket chain Kroger Co , pharmacy chain Rite-Aid Corp and shoe retailer Payless ShoeSource, as well as trade associations such as the National Association of Convenience Stores, National Grocers Association and the American Booksellers Association. A number of banks that issue Visa and MasterCard cards, including JP Morgan Chase & Co, were also named as defendants in the lawsuit, along with Visa and MasterCard’s payment networks. A spokeswoman for Bank of America NA said it believed the terms of the settlement were fair. JP Morgan declined to comment.

128,MA,TEXT-Fitch says merchant settlement's impact on card industry muted,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) July 17 - The long-term financial impact on the credit card industry from the $6 billion settlement of the antitrust suit against Visa, MasterCard, and major card-issuing banks will likely be modest, according to Fitch Ratings.   While the agreement reached on July 13 offers merchants an opportunity to  temporarily reduce interchange fees paid to banks, we do not believe that the  fundamental economics of credit card transactions have been changed materially  as a result of the settlement.  In addition to the agreed eight-month cut in swipe fees by 10 bps for merchants  accepting Visa and MasterCard, the settlement also supports a merchants’ ability to impose credit card surcharges on customers to recover part of their  card-related costs.    We believe the October 2010 settlement between Visa, MasterCard, and the U.S.  Department of Justice (DOJ) already provided merchants with some flexibility in  offering incentives for customers to move away from higher cost payment methods  toward debit cards or cash. The incremental impact of the new settlement on  merchants’ willingness to apply card surcharges will likely be limited,  particularly in highly competitive consumer markets where customers would be  expected to respond negatively to surcharges on card transactions.  The introduction of surcharges would also not be permitted in several states  (including California, Massachusetts, New York, and Texas, among others) due to  state-specific laws/regulations that prohibit charging a fee to consumers using  a credit card.   The settlement does not impose a long-term cap on interchange rates, which Fitch believes removes a significant overhang from the card networks. This would have  represented the most negative outcome for card processors and banks over the  long term, given the potential decline in fees.    In terms of the settlement costs, named defendants were adding to litigation  reserves in recent periods, as the case progressed. Given the potential for some merchants to opt out of the settlement, we believe defendants will manage  litigation reserves accordingly.   American Express (AmEx) and Discover Financial were not parties to the merchant  suit, but AmEx continues to fight the October 2010 DOJ suit in court, which  would allow for surcharging between various card products.

132,MA,Wal-Mart opposes proposed settlement on credit card fees,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the world’s largest retailer, on Tuesday joined the growing chorus of merchants opposed to a proposed settlement with Visa Inc. (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) over credit card fees. Wal-Mart said the $7.25 billion settlement would not change a “broken” system of what credit card companies charge retailers for processing credit and debit card payments, known as “swipe fees.” “The proposed settlement would not structurally change the broken market or prohibit credit card networks from continually increasing hidden swipe fees, which already cost consumers tens of billions of dollars each year,” the company said in a statement. The class-action settlement between retailers and the two biggest credit card companies, which is subject to court approval, is intended to resolve stores’ claims that Visa and MasterCard conspired with major banks to fix swipe fees. The settlement involves a payment to a class of stores of $6 billion from Visa, MasterCard and more than a dozen of the country’s largest banks who issue the companies’ cards. The card companies also agreed to reduce swipe fees for eight months, for a total consideration to stores valued at about $1.2 billion. In addition, the deal would allow stores to start charging so-called checkout fees to customers who pay with MasterCard or Visa credit and debit cards. Wal-Mart said the settlement would constrain innovation in payments and force retailers to broadly waive their rights to take action against the credit card networks for “detrimental conduct or acts.” Among those that have come out against the settlement, reached earlier this month, are the National Association of Convenience Stores and Wal-Mart rival Target Corp (TGT.N). It will be up to U.S. District Court Judge John Gleeson to approve or reject the settlement, a process that will play out in Brooklyn federal court over the next few months.

Net income rose to $700 million, or $5.55 per share, from  $608 million, or $4.76 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9 percent to $1.82 billion. On a constant currency basis, revenue rose 13 percent. The card network also took a pre-tax charge of $20 million, related to its share of the settlement in the ‘swipe fee’ lawsuit. Excluding the charge, the company earned $5.65 per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $5.58 per share, excluding items, on revenue of $1.87 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MasterCard, along with rival Visa Inc and banks that issue their credit cards, agreed to a $7.25 billion settlement with U.S. retailers in a lawsuit over the fixing of debit and credit card fees. MasterCard had already set aside $770 million to cover most of its $790 million liability. Cardholders made $661 billion of purchases worldwide, on a local currency basis, during the second quarter, up 13 percent. Worldwide purchase volume has grown at more than 15 percent for the last four quarter. Card payments outside the United States grew 18.6 percent, in local currencies, compared with 8.7 percent growth in the United States. The network has reported double-digit growth in U.S. card payments over the last year. Card rival American Express also indicated slowing spending growth when it reported results last month.

137,MA,U.S. gasoline demand dips as prices rise: MasterCard,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. motorists bought less gasoline in the last two weeks compared with a year earlier as prices at the pump shot up, MasterCard said in its bi-weekly SpendingPulse report on Tuesday. Gasoline demand over the two weeks ended August 3 fell 3 percent from a year earlier as the average price at the pump rose 10 cents to $3.53 per gallon, MasterCard said. Last week’s four-week moving average for demand was 4 percent lower than a year earlier. (Graphic:link.reuters.com/mak44s) Week-to-week, gasoline consumption increased 1.2 percent in the week to July 27, then fell 0.9 percent in the week to August 3, the report showed. A price rally started in the Chicago wholesale gasoline market last week and spread across the nation as problems persisted at the Midwest’s largest refineries and a crude oil artery was shut down in Wisconsin after it leaked more than 1,000 barrels of oil. Some of these price gains led to price hikes at pumping stations, especially in Illinois, according to travel group AAA. Rising ethanol prices, as the severe drought in the U.S. farm belt raged on, aggravated the rising cost of fuel, according to Avery Ash, an AAA spokesman. MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report shows year-to-date gasoline demand is 4.6 lower than a year ago.

140,MA,Retailers press forward on $7.2 billion card fee settlement,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for U.S. retailers said on Thursday they expect to submit a proposed $7.2 billion antitrust settlement with Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc for court approval within the next several months, despite opposition to the pact from some large merchants. The plaintiffs do not expect to make any changes to the proposed settlement when it is submitted for preliminary approval by an October 19 deadline, said co-lead counsel Craig Wildfang following a hearing in Brooklyn federal court. “We’re going as fast as we can - not as fast as we’d like, but we’re making progress,” he told U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein during the hearing, referring to supporting documents for the settlement. The settlement would be the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. It would resolve a seven-year-old lawsuit accusing the two credit card companies of conspiring with major banks to artificially inflate interchange fees, the amount paid to process electronic transactions involving credit and debit cards. The settlement requires approval by U.S. District Judge John Gleeson, who oversaw retailers’ previous $3 billion swipe-fee settlement with Visa and Mastercard in 2003. As part of the new pact, the credit card companies have offered to pay $6 billion and temporarily reduce interchange fees, also known as swipe fees, to save stores approximately $1.2 billion over an eight-month period, according to court papers. Despite support from Visa and Mastercard, which would pay the bulk of the $6 billion, the settlement has received a frosty reception from several trade associations and some big retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp. The National Association of Convenience Stores publicly rejected the settlement, and trade groups representing grocers and pharmacies, among others, have since voiced objections. The settlement would allow stores to charge customers extra if they pay with credit cards, although that ability would be limited by state law and stores’ agreements with other card companies, such as American Express Co, according to court papers. The settlement would also give merchants the right to negotiate collectively over swipe fees, and includes broad releases shielding Visa and Mastercard from future litigation over similar swipe-fee issues, court papers showed. The objectors have said the settlement does not offer meaningful reforms to swipe-fee structures. Some merchants have said they either will not or cannot impose credit card surcharges on customer payments, and others have objected to the releases barring future swipe fee suits. If enough stores opt out of the proposal — representing at least 25 percent of annual U.S. retail volume collectively —Visa and Mastercard have the option to withdraw from the deal, according to court papers. Several of the main objectors are being represented by lawyer Jeffrey Shinder. His law firm, Constantine Cannon, served as lead counsel on the 2003 settlement with Visa and Mastercard, although Constantine Cannon is not among the three firms designated as lead counsel for the current litigation. Objections will likely be taken up with the court after the settlement is formally submitted for approval, according to Shinder. “There are fundamental problems with this deal that the court absolutely needs to address before it gives its preliminary approval,” he said after the hearing. Wal-Mart and Target did not immediately have additional comment beyond their earlier concerns about the settlement, according to spokespeople for both companies. The case is In re Payment Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, No. 05-1720.

158,MA,Gasoline demand dips as prices rise,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline demand fell last week, compared with a year earlier, as a sharp uptick in southern California gasoline prices raised the average price motorists paid across the nation, a biweekly report from MasterCard showed on Tuesday. Gasoline demand last week fell 3.9 percent from a year earlier, on top of its 2.4 percent decline, year-over-year, in the previous week, MasterCard’s report showed. On average, demand over the two weeks ending October 12 fell 3.1 percent lower than a year ago. The average price of a gallon rose 4.00 cents-a-gallon to $3.82, 11.7 percent higher than in the same week last year. This followed a sharp, 31-cent rise in southern California pump prices over the last two weeks, after refinery outages created a severe supply shortage there. MasterCard’s data also showed that the four-week moving average for demand fell 2.1 percent last week.

161,MA,MasterCard profit beats as international business grows,"(Reuters) - MasterCard Inc reported a quarterly profit that handily topped market estimates as more people, particularly in Asia, opted to use credit and debit cards instead of cash. The No. 2 credit and debit card network’s third-quarter profit was helped by higher consumer spending in the United States. But growth in U.S. purchase volumes was the lowest in a year, at 7.4 percent compared with 13.7 percent a year earlier. Purchase volume growth, excluding the United States, came in at a more robust 14.5 percent, with purchase volumes in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Asia growing at 19.5 percent. MasterCard has been boosting its presence outside the United States, cashing in on higher-growth markets in Asia and the Nordic countries. MasterCard signed an exclusive partnership with Sweden’s Nordea Bank during the quarter, doubling its share of cards with the lender. “We think we can double our market share in the Nordic and Baltic regions for the next three years, further extending our presence in these markets that are actually doing relatively well,” Chief Executive Ajay Banga said on a post-earnings conference call. In India, MasterCard signed deals with travel company Thomas Cook to provide foreign exchange prepaid cards, and with ICICI Bank and Western Union Co, for a reloadable prepaid card. MasterCard’s customers, including banks and prepaid card companies across the world, had issued 1.9 billion of the company’s cards as of September 30. Increased consumer spending worldwide raised MasterCard’s third-quarter profit. Net income rose 8 percent to $772 million, or $6.17 per share, from $717 million, or $5.63 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $5.92 per share, excluding one-time items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 5 percent to $1.92 billion, but fell short of the $1.94 billion analysts had expected. MasterCard continues to expect second-half revenue growth to be lower than the levels it saw in the second quarter due to the timing of deals and global economic uncertainty, Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said on the call.

164,MA,Hundreds of U.S. retailers balk at $7.2 billion card-fee pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly 1,200 retailers said on Thursday they will urge a federal judge to reject a proposed $7.2 billion settlement between merchants and Visa Inc (V.N) and Mastercard Inc (MA.N) over credit card fees, calling it an “unacceptable” proposal that would strip away stores’ legal rights. The proposed settlement was submitted in October for preliminary approval by the court. If it receives first preliminary and then final approval, it would be the largest federal antitrust settlement in U.S. history, offering nearly 8 million merchants $7.2 billion in cash and temporary reductions in the interchange, or swipe fees, that stores pay to process credit and debit transactions. Since it was first announced in July, the settlement has drawn a vocal chorus of opponents, including 10 of the 19 retailers and trade groups appointed to lead the litigation on merchants’ behalf. Those opponents - which include the National Association of Convenience Stores and the National Restaurant Association - delivered a brief Thursday that asks U.S. District Judge John Gleeson to reject the proposal. Nearly 1,200 other merchants said in court filings that they were unhappy with the deal and would submit multiple briefs expressing their dissatisfaction. They range from some of the best-known U.S. retailers, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Ikea, to small businesses and major trade groups like the National Retail Federation. “The declarations from about 1,200 merchants, small and large, from every corner of the country, and every type of merchant speak volumes about the fact that something is very seriously wrong with this deal,” said Jeff Shinder, a lawyer representing the named plaintiffs opposing the deal. Opponents said the settlement offers no meaningful reform to swipe-fee rates. They have also blasted litigation releases that would shield Visa and Mastercard from new lawsuits over swipe fees. “Fundamentally, these merchants and their representatives object to the settlement because it will neither introduce transparency nor give merchants the ability to inject competition in a market that has not functioned competitively for decades,” objecting plaintiffs wrote in a court filing. “And the release, given its scope, will make the competitive problems in the marketplace worse for merchants, not better.” Visa, Mastercard and lawyers for stores that support the settlement have said they are confident the court will approve the deal. Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments Coalition, a trade group representing Visa and Mastercard, has called the objections a transparent political ploy by some merchants to force congressional action limiting swipe fees for credit card payments. In a brief order last week, Gleeson said that “at first blush” the proposal meets the legal threshold for preliminary approval, but he noted that the standard will be more stringent for final approval. A hearing on preliminary approval has been scheduled for November 9.

165,MA,"Visa, MasterCard profits rise with card use","(Reuters) - Increased consumer spending and card use worldwide drove quarterly profits higher for Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N), according to new financial reports from the two payments companies. Visa, which operates the biggest network for credit and debit cards, said that payments, adjusted for changes in currency exchange rates, grew 6 percent in the three months through September from a year earlier and maintained the pace from the prior three months. MasterCard, which has the second-biggest network, said its purchase volume grew 12 percent in the latest three months from a year earlier. Both companies said growth in their businesses outside of the United States led the increases in payment volumes. Visa’s gains were led by growth in its Asia and Pacific operations and MasterCard, too, showed big gains in its Asia, Pacific, Middle East and Africa segments. Both companies are trying to capture new business from increasing consumer preferences for cards and digital payments instead of cash. At the same time, they are also experimenting with mobile payments systems partly out of fear of losing business to upstart technology companies. Visa said profit, in what was its fiscal fourth quarter, rose to $1.7 billion from $880 million a year earlier. But that increase included an unusual boost of $627 million from reversing previously recorded reserves against having to pay additional taxes. Excluding the one-time gain, Visa earned $1.0 billion, or $1.54 per share, in the quarter. Analysts on average had expected the company to earn $1.50 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Visa also announced on Wednesday that its directors have authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program, bringing to $2.3 billion the amount executives may spend to buy back stock for the company. Buybacks have been an important source of growth in earnings per share for the company. Visa said it expects annual net revenue growth in the low double digits and adjusted earnings per share growth in the high teens in percentage terms for its new fiscal year. “Visa delivered strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year, a result of our focus on growing our core business, accelerating expansion of our business outside the U.S.,” outgoing Chief Executive Joseph Saunders said. The company said last week that Charles Scharf, a former head of JPMorgan Chase & Co’s (JPM.N) retail financial services division, will succeed Saunders, effective November 1. Like Visa, MasterCard benefited from strong growth overseas. MasterCard’s third-quarter net income rose 8 percent to $772 million, or $6.17 per share, from $717 million, or $5.63 per share, a year earlier.

167,MA,UPDATE 3-US retail credit card fee settlement gets preliminary OK,"By Jessica Dye Nov 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday granted preliminary approval to a proposed $7.2 billion settlement between merchants and Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc over credit card fees, despite objections from hundreds of retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. If the deal receives final approval from U.S. District Court Judge John Gleeson of Brooklyn, New York, it would be the largest federal antitrust settlement in U.S. history, offering nearly 8 million merchants $7.2 billion in cash and temporary reductions in the interchange, or swipe fees, they pay to process credit and debit transactions. Visa and Mastercard agreed to amend their no-surcharge policies within 60 days of preliminary approval of the deal, allowing merchants to charge customers extra for paying by credit or debit, although that will be restricted by state law. The stores that take Visa and Mastercard will be provisionally certified for settlement purposes and notified of their legal rights. Full terms of the deal will not take effect unless Gleeson gives final approval, which Visa and Mastercard say they believe will occur. The judge will hold a hearing to give objectors a chance to weigh in before then, although no date has yet been set. The $1.2 billion in temporary swipe-fee relief will take effect shortly after class members have been given an opportunity to opt out of receiving the monetary damages, even if the deal never receives final approval, according to settlement papers. During a packed hearing on Friday, lawyers for dozens of objectors — including Target Corp and Home Depot Inc  — told the judge that the settlement offered meaningless relief for merchants saddled with an estimated $30 billion in annual swipe fees. They also argued that releases shielding Visa and Mastercard from new litigation over the same claims would violate their legal rights and give the two companies protection from for any future anti-competitive behavior. No opt-out mechanism is provided for the no-surcharge rules or litigation releases. Lawyers for several dozen stores that support the pact — which include major grocery chains Kroger Co and Safeway Inc — told Gleeson that these concerns were based on “misinformation.” “It’s a lot of smoke and there’s very little fire,” said Richard Arnold, who represents some of the objectors. Gleeson called the initial objections “overstated” but noted that the legal standard for final approval would be much higher. Gleeson has yet to schedule a hearing on final approval. “I don’t mean to suggest there aren’t a number of issues that are going to require significant scrutiny,” he said. Gleeson said he was considering whether to appoint an independent expert to help him understand the economic impact of the changes to Visa and Mastercard’s no-surcharge rules. Visa general counsel Josh Floum said the company looked forward to bringing “closure” to the case, after seven years of litigation, including two years of settlement talks. “While we recognize some merchants may have different opinions, the settlement represents a solution reached after years of litigation and months of negotiation,” said Mastercard general counsel Noah Hanft.

Still, the shopping season was still young in November. MasterCard Advisors, the payment company’s research and consulting division, found that in recent years, holiday shopping peaks from Dec. 20 to Dec. 22. “Many Canadians may have gotten an early start with Black Friday and Cyber Monday this year, but it’s still a very young phenomenon in Canada,” Senior Vice-President Richard McLaughlin, said in a release.

173,MA,UPDATE 1-Canada's Dec retail sales growth lagged U.S.-Mastercard,"* Canada’s 1.6 pct growth lagged 2.4 pct growth in U.S. * Online sales jump 26 percent TORONTO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Canadian retail sales grew by a tepid 1.6 percent in December, lagging even the disappointing gains posted in the United States, the month when holiday shopping peaks, according to data released by MasterCard on Wednesday. Sales growth north of the border came in at less the half of the 4.3 percent rate that retailers delivered a year earlier, according to MasterCard’s SpendingPulse, published by the payment company’s research and consulting division. The figure also fell short of growth in the United States, where sales rose 2.4 percent in December, capping off what analysts consider a lackluster holiday shopping season there. The performance is bad news for Canadian retailers, already facing rising competition from U.S. chains expanding in Canada, and bracing themselves for the entry of Target Corp in the spring. The arrival of the No. 2 U.S. discounter is expected to shake up the industry across Canada. In December, MasterCard released data for November that showed only 1.3 percent sales growth, compared with 4.2 percent a year earlier. In early January, Hudson’s Bay Co said sales growth at its established department stores had slowed in the nine weeks to Dec. 29. But an especially weak performance by the U.S.-based Lord & Taylor chain in wake of Superstorm Sandy pulled down the parent’s overall result. Sales rose 6.7 percent at Hudson’s established Canadian department stores. At rival Sears Canada Inc, by contrast, same-store sales fell 5.8 percent in the nine weeks to Dec. 29. Apparel retailer Reitmans Canada Ltd showed a 2.4 percent decline for the same period. The news was better in e-commerce, as online sales in Canada jumped 26 percent. MasterCard said the sector is growing more quickly than in the United States, where sales rose 12.6 percent. To be sure, online retail has emerged more slowly in Canada. In some cases, if shoppers want to buy from a major retailer, they still must order from sellers based in the United States, contending with higher shipping costs and import duties. Online sales were still a relatively small part of total sales, only 6.6 percent, but the segment has now grown more than 20 percent year-over-year for 15 consecutive months. MasterCard said grocery sales were higher than average, compared with the month’s sales over the last five years. Sales rose 1.3 percent, following a 1.9 percent gain last year.

For the past four weeks, demand was 0.1 percent higher on average compared with the same period a year ago, Mastercard said in its SpendingPulse report, even as demand slipped by 1.6 percent against the previous week as prices rose. “The four-week year-over-year metric began to turn to positive territory ... the first growth rate since the week ending Sept. 21, 2012, and only the second time in over a year,” said John Gamel, gasoline analyst for the Mastercard Advisors SpendingPulse report. The average price of gasoline across the United States was $3.41 a gallon last week, 8 cents higher than the previous week. The largest price spikes were in the Midwest and the Rocky Mountain region, although the latter still enjoys some of the lowest average prices in the United States at $3.04 a gallon. The Lower Atlantic region experienced the smallest rise in prices, up 5 cents to $3.39 a gallon. Compared with a year ago, the average price of gasoline was down nationally by 1.7 percent and was lower across all regions apart from the Midwest, where prices were 0.6 percent higher, and New England, where prices were flat. “Overall, we will have to observe if the year-over-year comparisons continue to remain positive and therefore indicate an upward trend in gasoline demand, especially if prices continue to rise,” Gamel said.

186,MA,Judge dismisses ATM fee collusion lawsuits,"(Reuters) - A federal judge has dismissed antitrust lawsuits accusing Visa Inc, MasterCard Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co of conspiring to fix automated teller machine fees. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C., said that, while the three lawsuits “bristle with indignation,” the plaintiffs failed to show they were injured, or that there was a conspiracy to charge excessive or artificially high fees. “Notwithstanding plaintiffs’ adamant insistence that consumers are being overcharged, the court simply could not find facts to support that contention,” Jackson wrote. The plaintiffs included several individual consumers, 13 owners and operators of independent non-bank ATMs that compete with bank ATMs, as well as the National ATM Council, a trade group for those owners and operators. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bank of America spokeswoman Shirley Norton and MasterCard spokesman James Issokson said their companies are pleased with the decision. Visa spokesman Will Valentine, JPMorgan spokesman Thomas Kelly and Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez declined to comment. Visa and MasterCard are the world’s largest payment networks. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are the largest, second-largest and fourth-largest U.S. banks by assets. In September, financial research firm Bankrate.com said the cost of using out-of-network ATMs rose 4 percent in the prior year to a record $2.50. It also said people who use such ATMs paid their own banks an average $1.57 fee, up 11 percent. The lawsuits filed in October 2011 accused Visa and MasterCard of setting rules that barred ATM operators from offering lower prices on independent PIN debit card networks that were not affiliated with either company. These networks comprise 200,000 ATMs nationwide, many of which are found in such places as convenience stores and gas stations, court papers show. The plaintiffs said the alleged illegal agreements required operators of ATMs that accepted Visa- or MasterCard-branded cards to charge consumers no more for using those cards than they charged consumers who transact on other ATM networks. Visa and MasterCard said this helped consumers by setting a ceiling on ATM access fees. The plaintiffs countered it established a floor beneath which fees for transactions processed on other networks could not be discounted. In finding no conspiracy among Visa, MasterCard and the banks to restrain trade, Jackson said that “at most, plaintiffs allege that ATM operators - both banks and independent operators - make independent business decisions whether to participate in the Visa and MasterCard networks.” The cases, all in the U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, are National ATM Council Inc et al v.

188,MA,"MasterCard aims at mobile payment market with launch of ""digital wallet""","LONDON (Reuters) - Mastercard (MA.N) unveiled its bid to dominate the mobile payments market on Monday with a ‘virtual wallet’ allowing customers to keep personal payment details in their phone and avoid checkouts by scanning bar codes in-store to pay. Financial services companies like the U.S. credit-card company as well as technology names Google (GOOG.O) and eBay Inc’s (EBAY.O) PayPal are looking for ways to capitalize on the prevalence of consumers’ sophisticated phones by providing programs that house credit and debit cards, coupons and store loyalty program details virtually. Mastercard said its MasterPass service, effectively an app, would let customers pay for their goods without approaching a cashier by instead scanning a bar code and creating a digital receipt on their phone or tablet that can be shown as they exit the store. It can also be used for easier online payments, allowing customers a “one click” way to pay without the hassle of having to input their credit or debit card details each time. It comes almost a year after MasterCard’s first foray into the mobile payments market with PayPass, which let customers pay at store tills by simply tapping their cards against a sensor. The U.S.-based credit card company said the MasterPass system would be rolled out in Australia and Canada by the end of March. The United States will follow later in the spring, ahead of the UK in the summer. Participating retailers include Argos ARGOS11.MX , BootsABAQUO.UL and American AirlinesAMRARJ.UL, while banks which have signed up include Spain’s BBVA (BBVA.MC) and Santander (SAN.MC), Citigroup (C.N) in the United States, Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) and Sweden’s Swedbank (SWEDa.ST). Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard, said banks would pay to use the technology, but would not give any detail on what the charges would be. Banks will also be able to use a “private label” version that can wrap their own cards into the MasterPass virtual wallets.

189,MA,REFILE-MasterCard aims at mobile payment market with launch of 'digital wallet',"By Laura Noonan LONDON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Mastercard unveiled its bid to dominate the mobile payments market on Monday with a ‘virtual wallet’ allowing customers to keep personal payment details in their phone and avoid checkouts by scanning bar codes in-store to pay. Financial services companies like the U.S. credit-card company as well as technology names Google and eBay Inc’s PayPal are looking for ways to capitalise on the prevalence of consumers’ sophisticated phones by providing programs that house credit and debit cards, coupons and store loyalty program details virtually. Mastercard said its MasterPass service, effectively an app, would let customers pay for their goods without approaching a cashier by instead scanning a bar code and creating a digital receipt on their phone or tablet that can be shown as they exit the store. It can also be used for easier online payments, allowing customers a “one click” way to pay without the hassle of having to input their credit or debit card details each time. It comes almost a year after MasterCard’s first foray into the mobile payments market with PayPass, which let customers pay at store tills by simply tapping their cards against a sensor. The U.S.-based credit card company said the MasterPass system would be rolled out in Australia and Canada by the end of March. The United States will follow later in the spring, ahead of the UK in the summer. Participating retailers include Argos, Boots and American Airlines, while banks which have signed up include Spain’s BBVA and Santander, Citigroup in the United States, Italy’s Intesa Sanpaolo and Sweden’s Swedbank . Ed McLaughlin, chief emerging payments officer at MasterCard, said banks would pay to use the technology, but would not give any detail on what the charges would be.

191,MA,EBay hit as 'gloves come off' over PayPal digital wallet fee,"SAN FRANCISCO, March 18 (Reuters) - EBay Inc shares hit a new low for 2013 on Monday as concern mounted about the impact of a new “digital wallet” fee on the company’s PayPal business. MasterCard Inc, one of the largest payment networks, said earlier this year that it plans a new fee for digital wallet operators like PayPal starting in June. The actual dollar amount PayPal ends up paying may not be that large, analysts say. However, they are worried that this is part of a broader move by payment networks to target PayPal, which has become more of a direct competitor recently. “Payment networks are taking the gloves off,” Bill Carcache and Brian Nowak, analysts at Nomura Equity Research, wrote in a note to investors on Monday. “The incumbents will do everything in their power to prevent PayPal from riding on their rails without extracting a toll.” EBay shares slid 0.5 percent to $50.18, on Monday afternoon, leaving them down about 4 percent so far this year. Since eBay mentioned the MasterCard fee in a regulatory filing on Feb. 1, the company has lost about 12 percent of its market value - while Amazon is down about 1 percent and the Nasdaq Composite is up 2 percent. Analysts put that under-performance down to this new fee and concern about rising tension between PayPal and the payment networks. “The fact that PayPal, as the largest digital wallet player, could be singled out by a network like this is clearly a negative,” said Ken Sena, an analyst at Evercore Partners. PayPal is moving from its online roots into the physical retailer world, where the vast majority of payments still take place. It is a big opportunity for the business and that has driven eBay shares higher in the past year. However, as a payment option in lots of physical stores, PayPal will be a much bigger threat to network operators like MasterCard, Visa Inc and American Express, analysts say. Historically, Visa and MasterCard viewed PayPal’s success in the online world cautiously, but they were also happy because the service generated extra e-commerce transactions that ultimately got processed through their networks. “Now that PayPal has started moving to the physical point of sale, however, competitive intensity levels are rising as PayPal encroaches deeper into what has traditionally been the incumbents’ turf,” Nomura’s Carcache and Nowak said. At a conference last month, Chris McWilton, president of MasterCard’s U.S. Markets, complained that PayPal “rides for free” on other companies’ business models. “They’ve got to be cautious that they don’t get too big and start making people wake up and say wait a minute, I’m actually losing business here because of your moving into the physical space,” he added. The MasterCard fee will be charged on “staged” digital wallets, such as PayPal, Google’s Wallet, Square, iZettle in Europe and Intuit’s GoPayment, according to analysts. Staged digital wallets share less information with card issuers and the networks, creating customer service problems and making it more difficult to deal with card rewards programs, Carcache and Nowak explained. MasterCard may be doing this to encourage PayPal and other staged digital wallet operators to share more valuable information about where transactions take place and with which merchants, Evercore’s Sena said. Sena and other analysts are concerned that Visa and other networks will create similar digital wallet fees. A Visa spokesman declined to comment on Monday. If all payment networks assess such fees, but they are limited to transactions in the United States and exclude payments on eBay’s marketplace, that could shave about two cents a share off eBay’s annual profit, Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, estimated recently.

192,MA,"Visa CEO calls digital wallet fee on PayPal ""appropriate""","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Visa Inc Chief Executive Charlie Scharf suggested on Wednesday that the payment network may impose a fee on digital wallet operators like PayPal, following rival MasterCard Inc. MasterCard said earlier this year that it plans a new fee for digital wallet operators starting in June. PayPal is not an official payment network in its own right. Instead, when people use PayPal to pay for something, the purchases are funded from their bank account or their credit and debit cards. Because of this, PayPal already pays huge amounts of fees to Visa, MasterCard and American Express whenever a PayPal purchase is funded with a credit card bearing those logos. Shares of eBay Inc, owner of PayPal, the largest digital wallet operator, have been hit hard on concerns other payment networks may roll out similar fees, cutting into PayPal’s profitability. “I think it is totally appropriate to do that,” Scharf said during the Barclays Emerging Payments Forum on Wednesday, when asked if Visa was planning a digital wallet fee. Digital wallets are electronic versions of real wallets that store card and bank information and can be used to buy things online quickly and anonymously.

The MasterCard fee will be charged on “staged” digital wallets, such as PayPal, Google’s Wallet, Square, iZettle in Europe and Intuit Inc’s GoPayment, according to analysts. Staged digital wallets typically share less information with card issuers and the networks, creating customer service problems and making it more difficult to deal with card rewards programs, analysts say. “Allowing data to be passed through to our issuers and then not allowing data to be passed through to our issuers makes us re-think about our pricing and our rules,” Scharf said on Wednesday. Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said it is “inevitable” that Visa will follow MasterCard’s move and introduce a digital wallet fee of its own. “This is a fully functioning duopoly.

194,MA,UPDATE 3-Visa has no plans for digital wallet fee at this point -exec,"By Alistair Barr SAN FRANCISCO, March 21 (Reuters) - Visa Inc has no plans to implement a “digital wallet” fee at this point, Jim McCarthy, global head of product at the payment network, said on Thursday. The comment came amid concern Visa might follow MasterCard Inc’s recent move to impose a new fee on operators of digital wallets, such as PayPal, owned by eBay Inc. During a Barclays investor conference on Wednesday Visa Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said that the payment network’s relationship with digital wallet operators is changing as they move more into physical stores. A Visa spokesman said on Thursday that Scharf’s comments were about evolving relationships with payment industry participants, rather than the potential for a specific new fee from the company. Digital wallets are electronic versions of real wallets that store card and bank information and can be used to buy things online quickly and anonymously. These digital wallets are increasingly moving into the physical world, through consumers’ use of smartphones while shopping in retail stores. As a payment option in physical stores, PayPal will be a bigger threat to networks like MasterCard, Visa and American Express, analysts say. “PayPal has a great relationship with the card networks and we are in fact one of their largest customers,” a PayPal spokesman said on Thursday. “We continue to work closely with both Visa and MasterCard as the market evolves and technology changes how consumers shop.” EBay shares rose 0.9 percent to $52.88 in afternoon trading on Thursday, even as the Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.9 percent. Still, PayPal could end up paying an extra fee to Visa, if the payment network changes its mind later, according to Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “If MasterCard is successful at implementing the fee, Visa will join them,” Luria said. “All they said today is that they are not doing it yet.”",3212013,http://www.reuters.com/article/visa-paypal/update-3-visa-has-no-plans-for-digital-wallet-fee-at-this-point-exec-idUSL1N0CDBRM20130321
195,MA,Wall Street worries about PayPal's real-world expansion,"* Analysts: PayPal offline less profitable than its online business * eBay to favor growth over profit margins -analyst * MasterCard, Visa may dent profits with digital fee -analysts * PayPal rewards could turn margins negative -analyst By Alistair Barr SAN FRANCISCO, March 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street is having second thoughts about following PayPal from its online roots into the physical world. PayPal, a leader online, launched a push in 2011 to become a payment option in brick-and-mortar stores. The move increases PayPal’s potential market by a factor of at least 10, and has been a big driver of the shares of owner eBay Inc, which surged 68 percent in 2012. But ahead of an investor day meeting at eBay’s Silicon Valley headquarters on Thursday, some investors and analysts are beginning to worry that the initiative will sacrifice profit margins for growth. “Profitability of on-site payment will be dramatically lower than it is online,” said Bill Smead of Smead Capital Management, an eBay shareholder who has been bullish on the company for several years. Smead’s Seattle-based firm has trimmed its eBay position twice in the past year. “If it’s going to be a lot less profitable, PayPal may not expand there as much as previously thought,” he added. “I would look for eBay to address this at the investor day.” An eBay spokesman declined to comment. For the year, eBay’s stock is up 0.6 percent, lagging behind the Nasdaq Composite Index’s gain of 7.2 percent this year. Concern about lower profitability at PayPal has weighed on eBay’s stock. “Margin expansion may take a back seat to growth,” Colin Sebastian, an analyst at R.W. Baird, wrote in a note previewing eBay’s investor day. This year, eBay has been trying to control Wall Street’s expectations for PayPal profitability. On Jan. 16, the company said PayPal’s 2013 margin would be 24 percent, down from a previous forecast of 25 percent to 26 percent. In a Feb. 1 regulatory filing, eBay mentioned a new fee that MasterCard Inc plans to impose on “digital wallet” operators like PayPal, starting in June, and warned that such changes could increase PayPal’s costs and reduce profit margins. “Any time you take a successful business and move it to other arenas, there’s great opportunity and risk,” said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer of Philadelphia Trust Co. “There’s lots of competition out there, and it’s too early to know what PayPal margins will settle down to be.” If other payment networks follow MasterCard and impose a digital wallet fee on PayPal, that could shave 2 cents a share off eBay’s earnings each year, Sanjay Sakhrani, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, estimated recently. Even without pressure from MasterCard and Visa, PayPal’s Point-of-Sale, or POS, business as it is known, will be less profitable than its online business, according to analysts. PayPal has signed up several large retailers, including Home Depot, Toys ‘R’ Us and JC Penney, to accept PayPal in their stores. However, PayPal is taking a smaller cut of sales to persuade these retailers to test the service. PayPal’s POS business is only 30 percent as profitable as its online business, Brian Nowak, an analyst at Nomura, estimated in a note previewing eBay’s investor day. The bigger and potentially more expensive challenge will be to persuade consumers to drop their credit and debit cards in favor of PayPal when they shop in stores, Sebastian, Nowak and others say. Nowak expects PayPal to develop a rewards program to give users some incentives, similar to the ones offered by big credit card companies like Capital One Financial, American Express and Discover Financial Services. However, if PayPal offered something like that, its profit margin on offline transactions would go negative, Nowak estimated. On Thursday, during eBay’s investor day, Nowak said he will be looking for the company to explain how PayPal can fund a rewards program and still turn a profit processing in-store payments. Merchants could share in the cost of a PayPal rewards program, but this has its limits, Nowak said. One of the reasons merchants are trying PayPal in the first place is that it is cheaper than what is currently offered by existing payment networks like Visa Inc and MasterCard, the analyst noted. PayPal has not disclosed what it is charging brick-and-mortar retailers, but Nowak estimates that the company takes a cut of about 1.5 percent, compared with about 2 percent to 2.2 percent charged by Visa and MasterCard.",3252013,http://www.reuters.com/article/ebay-paypal-margins/wall-street-worries-about-paypals-real-world-expansion-idUSL2N0CH1GP20130325

197,MA,MasterCard under EU fire over payment card fees,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - MasterCard (MA.N) is under investigation by the European Union over the level of fees tourists to the EU are charged when using cards to make purchases, which the EU competition regulator said could hamper cross-border trade. The EU watchdog said on Tuesday MasterCard’s fees were a concern in view of the growing role of non-cash payments. “Fees charged for payments made by cardholders from non-European countries can be quite high. Actually, these types of fees are generally much higher than those charged within Europe,” Commission spokesman Antoine Colombani said. The world’s second-largest credit and debit card network after Visa (V.N) has already been banned by EU antitrust regulators from charging cross-border card fees within Europe after a Commission ruling in 2007. The latest investigation will also examine some of the company’s other business practices in the EU which the regulator said could hinder e-commerce and cross-border trade. MasterCard’s premium cards, which levy higher fees than normal cards, would also come under scrutiny, Colombani said. MasterCard, which could be fined up to $740 million or 10 percent of its 2012 revenue if found guilty, said it would cooperate with the Commission. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) welcomed the regulatory action, saying inter-bank fees push up prices, hurting consumers whether they pay with cash or with a card. “So in the end, all consumers are hit by a scheme which ultimately rewards the card company and issuing bank,” BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said in a statement. EU retail lobby EuroCommerce, whose 1997 complaint triggered the first regulatory investigation into MasterCard, also welcomed the Commission’s action but said more could be done. “Despite a Commission decision and a European Court judgment, card fees in many member states remain far too high,” EuroCommerce Director General Christian Verschueren said in a statement. Mastercard challenged the Commission’s 2007 ruling, but did agree to cap debit card fees at 0.20 percent and credit card fees at 0.30 percent of purchases while waiting for Europe’s top court to rule on its challenge. EU regulators are also investigating Visa Europe, the European licensee of Visa Inc (V.N) and Europe’s largest card network, over its credit card fees.

202,MA,Retail trade group to opt out of $7.2 bln credit card-fee pact,"NEW YORK, April 10 (Reuters) - A major retail trade association said Wednesday it will reject a proposed $7.2 billion settlement with credit-card giants Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc over card fees, calling it a “bad deal” for nearly 8 million U.S. merchants. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, or RILA, said it intends to “make a statement” by opting out of the potentially historic settlement just as lead lawyers for the plaintiffs and credit-card companies are preparing to file papers seeking final approval from a federal judge in Brooklyn , N.Y. RILA represents some of the largest U.S. retailers, including Walmart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and Home Depot Inc, all of which have previously expressed dissatisfaction with the proposed settlement. The move could prompt a new round of criticism of the deal from large U.S. retailers and possibly more opt outs. The credit card companies believe they have a judge’s backing in the settlement, but a high number of opt-outs could imperil the hard-fought pact. The proposed settlement, announced last year, would resolve an eight-year old lawsuit on behalf of U.S. merchants accusing Visa and Mastercard of artificially raising interchange, or swipe, fees, which are paid to process credit-card transactions. The settlement includes a $6.05 billion payment and $1.2 billion in temporary swipe-fee reductions, as well as changes to Visa and Mastercard rules to allow merchants to charge customers extra for using certain cards. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson has already given preliminary approval to the proposal, potentially the largest private antitrust settlement in U.S. history. Nearly 8 million stores, restaurants and other merchants that accept credit cards have been given until May 28 to opt out or object to the deal. If merchants opt out, they will not be eligible to receive a portion of the monetary damages. However, they will also not be bound by parts of the settlement that would prohibit them from suing Visa and Mastercard over similar interchange issues in the future, and could potentially bring their own lawsuits. RILA general counsel Deborah White said that the group is opting out of the settlement on its own behalf, and that each of its members will have to decide individually whether to object, opt out or stay in the litigation. “We do have the support from a large majority of our membership for opting out and objecting, and we want to make sure we’re shedding light on what the true ramifications are for the proposed settlement,” White said in an interview. The group believes that the litigation releases in the settlement will force merchants to forego future legal claims against Visa and Mastercard in exchange for “paltry” monetary relief over years of harm from swipe fees, which have cost merchants billions of dollars, White said. RILA is among the first major trade groups to come out swinging against the deal, which drew a flurry of opposition at the preliminary approval stage last year.  The National Grocers Association said in February that it would opt out, and urged its members to do the same. Visa, Mastercard and a lawyer for lead plaintiffs supporting the settlement did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday evening.

Visa reported rising growth in the key U.S. market in contrast to MasterCard, which has suffered as some of its biggest issuers, including Citigroup Inc, struggle. Visa stock rose 2.2 percent in after-hours trading while shares in MasterCard, which reported earlier in the day, closed down 2.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. Both reported purchase volume increases of 9-10 percent from a year earlier, after adjustment for currency fluctuations, but  MasterCard said its growth was slowing in the United States, the biggest market. Annual growth in MasterCard’s U.S. purchase volumes eased to 4.6 percent from 7.1 percent in the previous quarter. Visa’s annual growth edged up to 4.1 percent from 3.0 percent. () As well, MasterCard was downbeat about coming months. “In the U.S., the second quarter right now looks a little bit dodgy, but there could be some upside going into the second half of 2013 as far as U.S. economic growth is concerned,” MasterCard Chief Executive Ajay Banga said on a post-earnings conference call. Visa raised its fiscal 2013 earnings forecast to around 20 percent in earnings per share from a previous outlook for gains in the high-teens. Consumer sentiment across the globe has remained muted, given the uncertainty in Europe and China’s slowing growth. U.S. consumer spending has taken a hit from higher payroll taxes. MasterCard said it signed a memorandum of understanding with China’s Alibaba Group, Asia’s largest e-commerce company, to offer epayment services to potentially 800 million Alibaba customers. Both MasterCard and Visa are trying to capture new business as consumers turn increasingly to cards and digital payments instead of cash. They are also experimenting with mobile payments as they fear losing business to upstart technology companies. Digital wallets are electronic versions of real wallets that store card and bank information and can be used to buy things online quickly and anonymously. They are increasingly being used on smartphones to shop in retail stores, posing a threat to networks such as MasterCard, Visa and American Express.

MasterCard shares were down 2.6 percent at $538.54 on Wednesday afternoon. They had previously risen about 6 percent this year. “In the U.S., the second quarter right now looks a little bit dodgy, but there could be some upside going into the second half of 2013 as far as U.S. economic growth is concerned,” Chief Executive Ajay Banga said on a post-earnings conference call. Consumer sentiment across the globe has remained muted, given the uncertainty in Europe and China’s slowing growth. Consumer spending has also taken a hit from higher payroll taxes and a delay in tax refunds. MasterCard customers made $690 billion of purchases worldwide on a local currency basis, up 10 percent from a year earlier, but down 5 percent from the fourth quarter of 2012. “Looking ahead, recent positive news about the strengthening of U.S. housing market — could be a good signal that the economy is turning. But we are going to watch, and the second half of 2013 will be the test of that,” Banga said. MasterCard maintained its forecast of 20 percent compounded annual growth in earnings per share between 2013 and 2015. Both MasterCard and its larger rival, Visa Inc (V.N), are trying to capture new business as consumers turn increasingly to cards and digital payments instead of cash. They are also experimenting with mobile payments as they fear losing business to upstart technology companies. MasterCard plans to charge a fee for digital wallet operators such as PayPal, starting in June. Visa’s CEO had said that the company may follow suit.

The company is also looking to boost its presence outside the United States, tapping higher-growth markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, where cash transactions dominate. Purchase volumes in Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa grew 19.1 percent.

209,MA,Consumer credit posts smallest gain in eight months,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Consumer credit recorded its smallest increase in eight months in March, a possible hint that Americans are still trying to pare their debts. Consumer installment credit rose by $7.97 billion to $2.81 trillion, the Federal Reserve said on Tuesday. It was the smallest increase since July and well below economists’ expectations for a $16 billion rise. For the first quarter, the total flow of credit rose at an annual rate of $157.1 billion, slowing from a $177.7 billion increase in the last three months of 2012. Revolving credit, which mostly measures credit-card use, fell $1.71 billion after rising $453 million in February. Credit from depository institutions fell in March, while advances by financial institutions were unchanged. “One sobering statistic that argues against a rebound in household credit growth in the near future is that student loans have been the driver of any growth in credit to households,” said Julia Coronado, chief North America economist at BNP Paribas. U.S. households built up a massive debt load as the housing bubble expanded. Efforts to pay down those debts have been a restraint on spending and the economy’s recovery. The drop in credit card usage casts doubt on views that household deleveraging is almost over, as recently suggested by other data that had fueled hopes consumers might soon borrow and spend more freely. Nonrevolving credit in March, which includes auto loans and student loans made by the government, rose $9.68 billion in March. That followed an $18.18 billion increase in February. Over the past year, nonrevolving credit from the federal government increased $108 billion, mostly reflecting increased tuition fees. Some economists, however, were little fazed by the drop in revolving credit and said it still appeared household deleveraging had run its course. “While the weaker March reading is disappointing, the relatively steady improvement in consumer credit growth over the past year should remain supportive for future consumer spending,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York. “While there have been concerns that student loans are exclusively been behind the improvement in the credit picture, consumer credit growth ex-student loans remains relatively robust.” ",5072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-credit/consumer-credit-posts-smallest-gain-in-eight-months-idUSBRE9460UX20130507
210,MA,CORRECTED-UPDATE 5-Huge cyber bank theft spans 27 countries,"(Corrects by adding Mastercard’s statement, instead of saying it declined comment) By Jessica Dye, Joseph Ax and Jim Finkle NEW YORK/BOSTON, May 9 (Reuters) - In one of the biggest ever bank heists, a global cyber crime ring stole $45 million from two Middle Eastern banks by hacking into credit card processing firms and withdrawing money from ATMs in 27 countries, U.S. prosecutors said on Thursday. The U.S. Justice Department accused eight men of allegedly forming the New York-based cell of the organization, and said seven of them have been arrested. The eighth, allegedly a leader of the cell, was reported to have been murdered in the Dominican Republic on April 27. The ringleaders are believed to be outside the United States but prosecutors declined to give details, citing the ongoing investigation. What’s clear is the sheer scope and speed of the crimes: in one of the attacks, in just over 10 hours, $40 million was raided from ATMs in 24 countries involving 36,000 transactions. “In the place of guns and masks, this cyber crime organization used laptops and the Internet,” U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Loretta Lynch said at a news conference. “Moving as swiftly as data over the Internet, the organization worked its way from the computer systems of international corporations to the streets of New York City.” The case demonstrates the major threat that cyber crime poses to banks around the world. It also shows how increasingly international and sophisticated criminal gangs have become, particularly those using the Internet. Prosecutors highlighted the “surgical precision” of these hackers, the global nature of their organization, and the speed and coordination with which they executed operations in 27 countries. According to the complaint, the gang broke into the computers of two credit card processors, one in India in December 2012 and the other in the United States this February. The companies were not identified. The hackers increased the available balance and withdrawal limits on prepaid MasterCard debit cards issued by Bank of Muscat of Oman, and National Bank of Ras Al Khaimah PSC (RAKBANK) of the United Arab Emirates, according to the complaint. They then distributed counterfeit debit cards to “cashers” around the world, enabling them to siphon millions of dollars from ATMs in a matter of hours. In New York, for example, members of the cell fanned out into the city on the afternoon of Feb. 19, armed with cards bearing a single Bank of Muscat account number. Ten hours later, they had completed 2,904 withdrawals for $2.4 million in all, the final transaction coming around 1:26 a.m., prosecutors said. Casher crews in other countries were busy doing the same, pulling some $40 million from Bank of Muscat to add to the $5 million they stole from RAKBANK in December, according to the indictment. In total, cashers made some 40,500 withdrawals in 27 countries during the two coordinated incidents. Prosecutors said the method of attack was known as “Unlimited Operations” in the cyber underworld. Representatives for the two banks could not be reached for comment outside of regular business hours. In a statement, Mastercard said it had cooperated with law enforcement in the investigation and stressed that its systems were not involved or compromised in the attacks. In late February, Bank Muscat disclosed that it would take an impairment charge of up to 15 million rials ($39 million) because it had been defrauded overseas by 12 prepaid debit cards used for travel. That charge was equal to more than half of the 25 million rials profit it posted in its first quarter ended March 31. Cyber experts said they believe the operation likely required the work of several hundred people, at least several of whom were highly skilled hackers capable of devising ways to penetrate well-protected financial systems. “Hackers only need to find one vulnerability to cause millions of dollars of damage,” said Mark Rasch, a former federal cyber crimes prosecutor, based in Bethesda, Maryland. The group may have targeted Middle Eastern banks because they tend to allow customers to put much larger sums on cards and do not monitor them as closely as banks in other regions, said Shane Shook, global vice president of consulting for the security firm Cylance Inc. “It’s a target-rich environment in terms of soft electronic security,” said Shook, an Arabic speaker who has spent more than a decade investigating cyber crimes. The case is similar to one in 2009 that targeted the prepaid debit-card unit of Royal Bank of Scotland, which lost more than $9 million in less than 12 hours, said Jason Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who supervised the Justice Department’s handling of that case. That case was considered a watershed moment in cyber crime prosecutions at the time. “This dwarfs that case,” he said. It is not clear if banks can seek to recover losses from card processors, legal experts said. Contracts usually have specific language governing the security protocols that must be in place, said Frederick Rivera, an attorney with Perkins Coie who specializes in financial services litigation. If the processors failed to follow those requirements, they could be liable for the losses. If they had adequate security, however, the banks “could be left holding the bag,” Rivera said. The banks might also be able to seek reimbursement under their insurance policies, many of which now have cyber crime provisions, or from the processors’ insurance carriers. Weinstein also said that the processors could face regulatory scrutiny over whether they provided proper security. The eight defendants - all U.S. citizens and residents of Yonkers, New York - were charged with withdrawing cash from the ATMs and transporting money, not hacking into the credit card processing firms or managing the operation. The seven arrested are: Jael Mejia Collado, Joan Luis Minier Lara, Evan Jose Peña, Jose Familia Reyes, Elvis Rafael Rodriguez, Emir Yasser Yeje and Chung Yu-Holguin (known as “Chino El Abusador”). All except for Rodriguez were arraigned on Thursday and pleaded not guilty. Rodriguez’s attorney was unavailable. Only Pena has been released on bail. The defendant who reportedly had been killed was Alberto Yusi Lajud-Peña, also known as “Prime” and “Albertico.” Lynch said it was unclear whether the murder was related to this case. Prosecutors said cashers often laundered their proceeds by purchasing luxury goods, and sending a portion of the money back to the organization’s leaders. Lynch said the New York gang kept roughly 20 percent of their takes, and sent the rest to the organizers. Authorities said they seized hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and bank accounts, as well as two Rolex watches and a Mercedes SUV, from the defendants. Investigators said that they found an email exchange with an account associated with a criminal money laundering operation in St. Petersburg, Russia, describing wire transfers. An investigation is ongoing to see if other cells are operating in the country, Lynch said, adding that U.S. law enforcement had worked with counterparts in Japan, Canada, Germany, Romania, the United Arab Emirates, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Italy, Spain, Belgium, France, United Kingdom, Latvia, Estonia, Thailand, and Malaysia to uncover the ring. No individual bank accounts were compromised by the scheme, Lynch said.

211,MA,EU Commission says Visa Europe offers cut in fees,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Visa Europe, the European licensee of Visa Inc. (V.N), has offered to cap its inter-bank credit card fees at 0.3 percent of transaction value for four years, the same level as the rival MasterCard (MA.N) network, to end a European Union competition investigation and stave off a possible fine. The European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday that the proposed reduction meant fees levied by Visa Europe, which is owned and operated by more than 3,700 European member banks, would be about 40-60 percent lower than at present. The offer is for cross-border and domestic fees. Visa Europe came under fire in July last year when the regulator said its fees harmed competition between banks and led to higher consumer prices. Its credit and debit cards account for about 41 percent of all payment cards issued in Europe, making it the largest card network in the 27-country European Union. In addition to cutting its fees, Visa Europe also offered to reform its rules, making it easier for businesses to seek better cross-border deals from competing banks. The EU antitrust authority said those interested in the matter will be able to comment soon on Visa Europe’s proposal before it decides whether to accept the offer. MasterCard, Europe’s second biggest credit and debit card network operator, capped its fees in 2009 in response to an EU investigation.

212,MA,"Large U.S. retailers sue Visa, MasterCard over card fees","(Reuters) - A group of U.S. retailers, including Macy’s Inc. (M.N) and Target Corp. (TGT.N), sued Visa Inc. (V.N) and MasterCard Inc. (MA.N) on Thursday, breaking off from a proposed $7.2 billion settlement reached last year over fees to process credit card transactions. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, came ahead of a May 28 deadline for the millions of merchants affected by the settlement to decide whether to forego receiving damages under the pact and pursue their own legal action. That settlement, pending in federal court in Brooklyn, would end litigation on behalf of merchants that accused Visa and MasterCard of inflating so-called interchange, or swipe, fees. Many retailers criticized the proposed settlement after it was announced in July 2012. They say the pact offers inadequate compensation and forces them to sign broad litigation releases that could shield Visa and Mastercard from future lawsuits over antitrust violations. By “opting out” of the settlement, the retailers can pursue separate litigation seeking damages over allegations of past antitrust violations. But even so, merchants would still be bound by other injunctive relief if the settlement goes forward, including changes to Visa and MasterCard’s swipe-fee rules. The pact received preliminary court approval from a federal judge in Brooklyn in November 2012, and Visa and Mastercard have said they are confident the settlement will win final approval. Representatives of Visa and MasterCard had no immediate comment on the new lawsuit. Also named as plaintiffs in Thursday’s lawsuit are JC Penney Co Inc. (JCP.N), Kohl’s Corp. (KSS.N) and TJX Cos (TJX.N). The lawsuit seeks compensatory and triple damages, as well as other remedies. On Tuesday, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

216,MA,"Visa, Mastercard ask U.S. court to declare card fees are lawful","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, opening another front in an eight-year battle over credit card fees paid by retailers, on Friday asked a federal judge to declare that the fees do not violate antitrust law. The lawsuit seeks to give the card companies legal ammunition against some retailers who are trying to opt out a proposed settlement under which they would receive a share of $7.2 billion in cash and fee discounts from the card companies. The complaint filed Friday in Brooklyn federal court by the credit card giants and a number of banks that issue their cards asks U.S. District Judge John Gleeson to declare that interchange, or swipe, fees are lawful and pro-competitive. On Thursday, Target Corp and other retailers, including JC Penney and Kohl’s, broke away from the pact. The retailers filed a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court against the credit card companies alleging past antitrust violations and seeking damages. The proposed settlement would end eight years of litigation by merchants who accused Visa and Mastercard of inflating swipe fees. Friday’s complaint was brought against retailers and trade groups who were named plaintiffs in the swipe fee litigation, but later opted out. If Gleeson rules that the swipe fees do not violate antitrust law, it could prevent them from pursuing separate damage actions. It could also affect the ability of other retailers who opt out to seek damages over swipe fees. “A declaration in plaintiffs’ favor against the defendants is necessary to prevent the continuation of endless, wasteful litigation between defendants and plaintiffs,” the complaint on Friday said. The motion from the card companies is the latest volley in a fierce legal fight over the settlement, which Gleeson preliminarily approved in November. If granted final approval, it would be the largest private antitrust settlement in U.S. history. On Tuesday, Wal-Mart and 18 other major retailers said they would opt out of receiving damages from the proposed settlement and consider separate legal action. They say the pact offers inadequate compensation for the billions of dollars they pay each year in interchange fees and forces them to sign broad litigation releases that could shield Visa and Mastercard from future lawsuits over antitrust violations. May 28 is the deadline for nearly 8 million merchants to decide whether to opt out of receiving monetary damages from the settlement. Visa and Mastercard, as well as lawyers for merchants that support the deal, have said they are confident the settlement will be approved. “Enough is enough - this battle needs to be put to bed,” Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments Coalition, a trade group representing the payment card industry, said Friday in a statement responding to the filing. If merchants that account for 25 percent or more of credit-card volume opt out of receiving damages, Visa and Mastercard have the option of terminating the proposed settlement.

219,MA,MasterCard in final battle to overturn EU ban on card fees,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - MasterCard (MA.N) will make a final attempt to overturn an EU ban on cross-border card fees in a hearing at Europe’s highest court next month, in a case with repercussions for the financial industry and global card payment systems. The case involves so-called multilateral interchange fees (MIFs) set by MasterCard, Visa and other credit and debit card firms and which are paid by retailers to banks that issue the cards. In 2007, the European Commission determined that such fees for cards issued in Europe were a violation of EU competition rules on fair competition and that they ultimately jacked up costs for consumers and merchants. Europe’s lower court upheld the regulatory decision in May last year. MasterCard has appealed and Europe’s top court, the European Court of Justice, will hold a hearing into the appeal on July 4, the court said on its website on Wednesday. The court does not set a date for a ruling and it could take several months or more than a year for the judges to reach a decision. If they rule against MasterCard, the company would have no further recourse to appeal. The case is important because MIFs are a major source of revenue for credit card companies. If the court rules they are illegal, it could have a wide impact on card payment systems and on how charges are imposed on consumers and retailers. European consumers and companies make more than 40 percent of their non-cash payments by card each year, a figure set to rise steadily as checks and money transfers die out. Limiting the fees credit and debit card companies charge has therefore become a high-profile consumer campaign issue for policymakers, while also attracting the attention of regulators. Following the Commission’s 2007 decision, MasterCard decided to cap its debit card fees at 0.2 percent and credit card fees at 0.3 percent, while also appealing against the decision to the lower court. Payment cards companies say merchants benefit from higher sales made by cardholders than those paying cash. In a separate case, the European Commission in April launched an investigation into the inter-bank fees MasterCard charges foreign tourists in the 27-country European Union, saying such charges could hamper cross-border trade.

223,MA,Federal Reserve appeals ruling on swipe fee for debit cards,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday appealed a judge’s decision to reject the agency’s cap on debit card transaction fees, a controversial requirement of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. The Wall Street reform law ordered the Fed to limit “swipe fees,” or the fees banks charge merchants when customers use debit cards. Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in late July that the Fed’s fee cap of 21 cents per transaction was higher than Congress intended. Banking industry groups protested that ruling, saying they need to charge the fees to offset the costs of offering debit cards. The Fed filed its appeal on Wednesday, according to documents posted on the district court’s website. “The Federal Reserve’s decision to appeal is the right thing to do for consumers who value debit cards and the financial institutions that serve them,” Frank Keating, president of the American Bankers Association, said in a statement on Wednesday. Lawmakers included the fee cap in Dodd-Frank in hopes it would trickle down to consumers in the form of lower prices. The Fed set the cap at 21 cents in 2011. Retailers, who had been expecting a much lower limit on swipe fees, complained the Fed had caved to lobbying by banks. The National Retail Federation and other groups filed a lawsuit to overturn the Fed’s cap. The judge’s eventual decision to rule in their favor dragged down shares of card companies Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc. The retail group criticized the Fed’s decision to appeal on Wednesday. “We are very disappointed to see the Fed giving in to the banks,” the group said in a statement. “The Fed has taken a position that will drag this out while retailers and their customers continue to pay billions of dollars in inflated fees.” Visa and MasterCard set the fee level that banks charge retailers for using their networks. Visa shares were up 3 percent at the end of the day on Wednesday, while shares of MasterCard fell slightly. Last week, Judge Leon ordered the Fed to determine whether it could write an interim rule lowering the cap, which would take effect immediately but could be adjusted later, and to report back to him on how long that would take. Scott Alvarez, the Fed’s general counsel, told Leon in court on Wednesday that the agency would prefer to keep the current fee cap in place while it went through the appeals process. Alvarez said it would be unreasonable to ask the Fed to craft new fee limits at the same time that the agency was asking an appeals court to approve its initial cap. Attorneys representing retail groups and banks both said they would have to change their systems to comply with an interim rule, even though an appeals court might wind up validating the original swipe fee cap. “Switching back and forth is something that imposes costs on everybody,” said Seth Waxman, an attorney with WilmerHale. He spoke on behalf of a number of banking industry trade groups, including the American Bankers Association, which were not directly involved in the lawsuit. Alvarez said if Leon did not stay his ruling, the Fed would ask the appeals court to do so. Leon said he would “keep an open mind” as he considered it.

225,MA,"Mastercard, Visa to cut French card fees -watchdog","PARIS, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Mastercard and Visa  have agreed to cut the fees to process credit card transactions in France by almost half. The French Competition Authority announced the agreement with Visa and Mastercard in the wake of proposed legislation from the European Commission that banks and payment firms limit the fees they charge on card payments. Card companies have waged a 20-year battle with the EU’s executive, which enforces antitrust rules in the 28-country bloc. A spokeswoman for the French regulator said that its remit was transactions within France, rather than the cross-border European transactions that are governed by the EU’s regulator. Both Visa and Mastercard will cut interbank fees to around 0.28 percent of the transaction value from about 0.5 percent currently, and will also reduce cash-machine fees to 0.55 euros ($0.74) per withdrawal from 0.75 and 0.60 respectively, the competition authority said in a statement. The agreement also comes after several moves by the French watchdog to cut bank customers’ fees in France. French banks agreed in 2011 to cut interbank card fees by more than a third and last year they pledged to cut fees charged for direct-debit bill payments. The watchdog has in the past criticised French banks for charging some of the highest interbank fees in Europe. A Visa Europe spokesman declined to comment. Mastercard did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",9232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/mastercard-visa/mastercard-visa-to-cut-french-card-fees-watchdog-idUSL5N0HJ1H320130923

Visa shares fell 3.1 percent to $197.50 in after-hours trade while those of rival MasterCard Inc fell 1 percent, ahead of its results on Thursday. Visa said it expects constant dollar revenue growth of low double digits and a foreign exchange headwind of 2 percentage points over the next year. It said its expectations are slightly lower than they were in June. It maintained its forecast for percentage growth per share in 2014 in the mid-to-high teens despite the continued slow pace of global economic recovery, and the growing impact of a strong U.S. dollar. Visa also authorized a new $5 billion share buyback program and said it believed the Federal Reserve had a strong case in its appeal against a court ruling limiting the fees banks charge retailers for debit card use. A successful appeal against the court ruling in July would protect an important revenue stream for card companies. Both Visa and MasterCard face slowing growth in the United States, their largest market. U.S. consumer sentiment slid in September to its lowest in five months as consumer lending rates rose and shoppers eyed sluggish economic growth ahead, a survey showed. Visa said its U.S. domestic payment volume dropped to 8 percent of global volumes in September from 11 percent in August. Visa and MasterCard have been trying to capture new business in emerging markets where more customers are signing up for cards and digital payments instead of cash. Net income attributable to Visa fell to $1.19 billion, or $1.85 per Class A share, from $1.66 billion, or $2.47, a year earlier. Analysts on average, had expected the company to earn $1.85 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total operating revenue rose 9 percent to $2.97 billion but came in short of analysts’ expectation of $3.02 billion due to a strong U.S. dollar. Visa’s results were hit by a $574 million income tax provision, compared with a benefit of $74 million a year earlier. The company gave no reason for the bigger tax bill. Visa’s payment volumes rose 13 percent to $1.1 trillion in the quarter. Foster City, California-based Visa’s shares have risen 35 percent since the beginning of the year, outperforming the broader S&P; 500 Index, which has gained around 24 percent.

The company, which also announced a new $3.5 billion buyback program, raised its quarterly dividend by 50 cents to $1.10 per share. Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said Tuesday’s actions were an indication of the management’s confidence in the company’s performance and the continued share appreciation. MasterCard’s shares have gained almost 60 percent this year as more people use cards for transactions across the world.

235,MA,U.S. judge approves retail credit card fee settlement,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Friday approved an estimated $5.7 billion class action settlement between merchants and Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) over credit card fees despite objections from thousands of retailers who complained it was inadequate. The settlement is believed to be the largest in a U.S. antitrust class action. Merchants first sued Visa and MasterCard in 2005, accusing the two companies of fixing the fees charged to merchants each time their customers used their credit or debit cards. They were accused also of preventing merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payments. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson of Brooklyn, New York, approved the settlement in a written order. He also dismissed some of the objections made by merchants opposed to the deal as hyperbole. At a fairness hearing in September, he noted that one objector cast Visa and MasterCard as Nazis. “I conclude that the proposed settlement secures both a significant damage award and meaningful injunctive relief for a class of merchants that would face a substantial likelihood of securing no relief at all if this case were to proceed,” Gleeson wrote. The value of the settlement, reached last year, decreased to $5.7 billion from roughly $7.2 billion after thousands of merchants opted out of the deal, according to Craig Wildfang, an attorney for the plaintiffs. Mallory Duncan, general counsel for the National Retail Federation, which opposed the settlement, said in a statement that his organization was reviewing Gleeson’s ruling and expected to file an appeal. “The settlement permanently ties the hands of thousands of businesses who wanted nothing to do with this misguided case, and a decision to approve it violates established law and common sense,” he said. The settlement provides for cash payments to merchants nationwide and lets them begin charging customers an extra fee when they use Visa or MasterCard credit cards. For Visa and MasterCard, Gleeson’s decision could go a long way to alleviate a major legal headache that has plagued them for more than a decade. In 2003, two years before the current case started, Visa and MasterCard settled a similar case with merchants over rules governing the use of their cards. Visa Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf said in a statement that the company “realized a significant achievement in our efforts to resolve the long-standing legal differences between merchants and the payments industry.” MasterCard general counsel Noah Hanft called Gleeson’s decision “an important milestone in putting this litigation behind us,” according to a statement. Approval of the current settlement has been opposed by many of the largest players in the retail industry. Around 8,000 merchants, accounting for about 25 percent of the transactional volume at issue in the case, opted out of the settlement. Among those opting out were the largest retailers in the United States, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), and Target Corp (TGT.N). Those businesses have complained about a broad litigation release in the settlement. The release forces all merchants who accepted Visa or MasterCard, and even those who will in the future, to give up their right to sue the credit card companies over rules at issue in this case or similar ones they may make in the future. Those objectors also argued that the settlement offered meaningless reforms that would not help them control the costs of accepting credit cards. Under certain circumstances, the settlement allows merchants to charge customers extra if they use Visa or MasterCard credit cards. But critics of the deal point out that those opportunities are extremely limited, and certain states prohibit such surcharging. The critics also say that merchants are unlikely to take advantage of surcharging for fear of upsetting consumers or losing them to competitors that do not impose a surcharge. Many retailers who opted out of the settlement have filed their own lawsuits. The case is In Re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, No. 05-1720.

236,MA,"RPT-Target, other U.S. breaches may spur security spending -executives","By Ross Kerber BOSTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - A rash of data breaches at big U.S. retailers may accelerate spending on high-tech payment cards, a MasterCard Inc executive and other industry specialists said on Monday, as companies look to keep the faith of their customers. Retailers and their banks face a deadline set by payment networks Visa Inc and MasterCard of October 2015 to accept new payment cards that store information on computer chips rather than on traditional magnetic stripes. The multibillion-dollar safety upgrade has many companies dragging their feet, and analysts estimated only 60 percent of U.S. sales terminals would meet the schedule. Now the loss of customer data reported at Target Corp, Neiman Marcus and other stores since December could move companies to the new standard more quickly, said Carolyn Balfany, head of U.S. product delivery for MasterCard in a telephone interview on Monday. The risks created by the breaches will clarify to companies the benefit of moving quickly to the new standard, she said. “That’s the clarity,” she said. Among companies that could profit from a faster switch to chip-based cards are those that make equipment used to swipe them, such as the United States’ VeriFone Systems Inc  and France’s Ingenico. MasterCard, of Purchase, N.Y., is the second-largest payment network operator behind Visa of Foster City, California. Visa has not made executives available to be interviewed since Target first reported its breach on Dec. 19. A response gaining attention among security specialists has been the conversion of U.S. sales terminals to a card standard widely used in Europe and Asia, sometimes known as “EMV” after the initials of its creator companies Europay, MasterCard and Visa. Cards meeting the standard carry chips to make them harder to counterfeit, and to protect sensitive data with encryption. They can also require users to enter a personal identification number, or PIN, to make purchases, an extra layer of security compared to the signatures used by traditional credit cards. Although the new technology may not have prevented the data thefts from Target and elsewhere, it would make any stolen data harder to re-use and has cut fraud where it has been adopted. In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Target Chief Executive Gregg Steinhafel said the company wanted to lead the retail industry’s move to adopt the new cards. His remarks echoed those made by the general counsel of the National Retail Federation on Sunday.

The cost of switching would have to cover new sales terminals and the issuing of new plastic to replace the roughly 1.1 billion credit, debit and prepaid cards now circulating in the United States. A traditional card costs about $1 to print, personalize and mail to a consumer, whereas the new cards can cost up to $10 each depending on the volume printed and the memory in their chips, estimated Javelin Strategy analyst Al Pascual.

Big equipment makers like VeriFone and Ingenico have already wound down sales of their older magnetic-stripe-only card readers in the U.S. Thierry Denis, president of Ingenico’s North American unit, said the breaches have focused attention on the retailers to upgrade their systems but that banks also need to issue the cards customers will need for the new card readers to catch on. “It’s chicken and egg,” he said.

238,MA,UPDATE 2-MasterCard suffers setback in fight to keep fees,"* Challenge to EU ban on transaction fees dealt blow * Adviser to top court says firm’s appeal should be dismissed * Move may bolster EU regulatory clampdown * MasterCard says interference will push up consumer costs By Foo Yun Chee LUXEMBOURG, Jan 30 (Reuters) - MasterCard’s five-year battle to keep multi-billion-euro cross-border card fees was dealt a blow on Thursday when an adviser to Europe’s top court backed efforts to reduce such charges. The legal opinion follows a European Commission ruling that said MasterCard’s cross-border “interchange” fees - levied on retailers’ credit and debit card transactions - broke antitrust rules and had to be changed. Mastercard challenged this but the court adviser’s recommendation now means it is likely to fail. The EU antitrust regulator says such fees cost businesses across Europe 10 billion euros ($13.64 billion) a year. Many consumer rights campaigners argue these hidden costs, charged when banks process payments by, for example, a German visiting London, are passed on to the consumer. “I propose that the court should dismiss the main appeal (by MasterCard) and the cross-appeals,” Advocate General Paolo Mengozzi at the EU Court of Justice said in his opinion. The court, which will issue its judgement in the coming months, follows such advice in the majority of cases. The opinion represents a setback to the world’s second-largest credit and debit-card company after Visa. Mastercard says such interference would actually lead to higher costs for consumers and encourage the black economy. The advice may also bolster support for proposed European Union rules to cap charges on card payments that have yet to be approved by EU countries and the bloc’s parliament. That crackdown is part of the Commission’s push to boost e-commerce in the 28-country bloc and reduce costs for business. Interchange fees are collected and kept by banks processing payments using cards. While MasterCard does not benefit directly from the charge, it fears a crackdown will discourage lenders from issuing its cards. MasterCard, which faces increasing competition from rival payment schemes such as eBay’s PayPal, was critical of the decision. “Practical experience in countries such as Spain, Australia and the United States shows that capping interchange shifts the costs for transactions from retailers on to consumers,” MasterCard President Javier Perez said in a statement. “A one-size-fits all approach to interchange across Europe will drive the cost of cards up for consumers ... and ignores the very different market realities across European countries,” he said. EU retail lobby EuroCommerce, whose 1997 complaint triggered the first regulatory investigation into MasterCard, welcomed the recommendation. “This should be another reason for the European Parliament to go forward with regulation on interchange fees,” said Ruth Milligan of EuroCommerce. MasterCard has said the value of cross-border card transactions is less than 5 percent of all purchases made by cardholders. A lower court threw out its challenge in 2012. In the long-running dispute with the European Commission about such charges, MasterCard has made some concessions. It agreed to reduce its debit card charges to 0.20 percent of a transaction and 0.30 percent for credit cards, pending this court ruling. Rival Visa Europe, Europe’s largest card network and the European licensee of Visa, has offered similar concessions.

The crackdown is part of the Commission’s push to boost e-commerce in the 28-country European Union and reduce costs for business - though MasterCard fears cutting the fees will discourage banks from issuing its cards. “I propose that the court should dismiss the main appeal (by MasterCard) and the cross-appeals,” Advocate General Paolo Mengozzi at the EU Court of Justice said in his opinion.

242,MA,MasterCard 2014 revenue to come in at low end of forecast,"(Reuters) - MasterCard Inc (MA.N) posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and said its net revenue for the year would come in at the low end of its three-year forecast range as customers migrate to Visa Inc (V.N) as part of a previously announced deal. In 2013, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), which issues both MasterCard and Visa-branded cards, signed a 10-year agreement under which the bank will commit more credit and debit card transaction volumes to Visa. “We don’t have any specifics on how these cards will migrate, but we are now assuming an impact in 2014. Given the size of this portfolio we can offset some, but not all, of this attrition with our wins,” MasterCard Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said on a post-earnings conference call. MasterCard shares were down 5 percent at $75.98 in late-morning trading. They fell as much as 10 percent. The company had forecast net revenue growth of between 11 and 14 percent for the period between 2013 and 2015. MasterCard reported a 21.1 percent rise in operating expenses at $1.21 billion as the company set aside $95 million for litigation settlements. The company also saw its rebates and incentives it offers to customers increase 23 percent to $925 million as it signed up more business. In the fourth quarter, MasterCard signed an agreement with pan-African bank Ecobank Group and also extended its agreement with U.K.-based Tesco Bank. MasterCard also renewed its agreement with Bank of Montreal (BMO.TO). MasterCard joined its larger rival, Visa, in urging U.S. merchants and banks to hasten the adoption of a more secure technology for credit and debit cards after security breaches at several retailers. “What we would now like to see is that all players within the payments ecosystem come together with a sense of urgency to ensure that the highest payment security standards are put into place,” MasterCard Chief Executive Ajay Banga said. MasterCard’s net income rose 3 percent to $623 million, or 52 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were 57 cents per share, below the average analyst estimate of 60 cents. Net revenue rose 12 percent to $2.13 billion. Analysts on average had expected $2.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters MasterCard’s worldwide purchase volume increased 11 percent to $805 billion from a year earlier, while annual growth in its U.S. purchase volumes rose 7.4 percent to $275 billion. The company announced a 10-for-1 stock split and raised its quarterly dividend by 83 percent last month. Shares of MasterCard have risen 66 percent in the 12 months ended December, outperforming the broader S&P; 500 Index .SPX which rose 30 percent in the year.

MasterCard joined its larger rival, Visa, in urging U.S. merchants and banks to hasten the adoption of a more secure technology for credit and debit cards after security breaches at several retailers. “What we would now like to see is that all players within the payments ecosystem come together with a sense of urgency to ensure that the highest payment security standards are put into place,” MasterCard Chief Executive Ajay Banga said. MasterCard’s net income rose 3 percent to $623 million, or 52 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were 57 cents per share, below the average analyst estimate of 60 cents. Net revenue rose 12 percent to $2.13 billion. Analysts on average had expected $2.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MasterCard’s worldwide purchase volume increased 11 percent to $805 billion from a year earlier, while annual growth in its U.S. purchase volumes rose 7.4 percent to $275 billion. The company announced a 10-for-1 stock split and raised its quarterly dividend by 83 percent last month. Shares of MasterCard have risen 66 percent in the 12 months ended December, outperforming the broader S&P; 500 Index  which rose 30 percent in the year.

247,MA,"MasterCard, Visa form group to push for better card security","(Reuters) - Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc said they had launched a cross-industry group to improve security for card transactions and press U.S. retailers and banks to meet a 2015 deadline to adopt technology that would make it safer to pay with plastic. The move follows several data breaches at U.S. retailers, including one at Target Corp late last year involving the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records. The new group - which includes banks, credit unions, retailers and industry trade associations - will initially focus on the adoption of ‘EMV’ chip technology, MasterCard and Visa said in a statement on Friday. EMV cards, already used in Europe and Asia, store information on computer chips rather than on traditional magnetic strips, making them harder to counterfeit. They can also require - depending on the issuer - that users enter a personal identification number, or PIN, to make purchases, adding an extra layer of security. However, the National Retail Federation, the world’s largest retail trade association, said it had not joined the group because there were no plans to immediately implement the PIN option, making for a “half-baked solution.” “They’re not serious about reducing fraud, unless they put a pin on,” said Mallory Duncan, the NRF’s general counsel. “We remain insistent that U.S. retailers’ customers be given the same protections as consumers in more than 80 countries who have both a chip and a PIN securing their credit and debit cards,” Duncan said in a statement. Visa and MasterCard declined to provide details on specific proposals for the technology to be used in the cards or the make-up of the cross-industry group. The American Bankers Association did not respond to requests for comment but Patrick Keefe, a spokesman for the Credit Union National Association, confirmed that the trade association was part of the industry group. “The recent high-profile breaches have served as a catalyst for much needed collaboration between the retail and financial services industry on the issue of payment security,” Visa President Ryan McInerney said in the statement. MasterCard and Visa had already set a deadline of October 2015 for U.S. retailers to adopt the new payment technology. “Probably about 80 percent plus of the larger retailers were going to be able to make the deadline anyways,” said David Robertson, publisher of payment industry newsletter The Nilson Report. Robertson said the formation of the group would help push small and mid-size retailers to adopt the new technology. Banks and retailers have been dragging their feet over the upgrade, at odds over how the costs would be split. The NRF has said it could cost the U.S. retail industry about $30 billion to upgrade to chip-based cards, including equipment, training and software. “Banks and retailers want to make sure that if they invest in new infrastructure, they’ll get the return in reduced fraud,” Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria told Reuters.

251,MA,"Coming to a store near you: UnionPay, the world's biggest bankcard","SHANGHAI, March 12 (Reuters) - In UnionPay’s curved glass headquarters in Shanghai’s financial hub of Pudong, a plaque commemorates a visit by former Chinese President Hu Jintao in 2010. Emblazoned on it is a quote from Hu urging the company to “step up the effort to internationalize and strive to build UnionPay into a major global brand for bankcards”. China’s renminbi currency is not yet an international currency - it is not freely convertible. Yet China’s official bank card has achieved Hu’s dream of global dominance. China UnionPay has become the world’s largest card brand with 3.53 billion cards in circulation, just over a decade after it was founded in 2002. Its $2.5 trillion in transactions in the first half of last year was second to Visa Inc’s $4.6 trillion, says industry newsletter the Nilson Report. UnionPay has achieved this kind of dominance by having a virtual monopoly on bank card transactions in China, and according to its rivals, offering low fees to retail merchants at home and abroad. In China, foreign rivals such as American Express, MasterCard Inc and Visa must use UnionPay’s yuan settlement network. Credit and debit card settlement is a big, profitable and growing business in China. Interbank card transactions jumped 37 percent from 2011 to 21.8 trillion yuan ($3.58 trillion) in 2012. Central bank regulations also give UnionPay the rights to settlements for all online transactions in China. UnionPay transactions overseas show equally impressive growth, rising 30 percent year-on-year in 2012, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Overseas revenue now accounts for around 5 percent of UnionPay’s total, according to a Hong Kong fund manager briefed by UnionPay executives. UnionPay, which is not a public company, does not disclose financial results or details. The United States, home to UnionPay’s biggest rivals, has complained long and often about its privileged status in China. In 2012, following complaints by Washington, the World Trade Organization ordered China to stop discriminating against foreign bank card rivals such as Visa and Mastercard, but did not make any specific recommendations. “A more efficient payment card system in China would be more beneficial for both merchants and consumers,” U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said at the time. China has yet to open the bank card market. UnionPay regularly waives fees that its rivals charge and is known for having the lowest fees in the market overseas, said the head of bank card operations at a Hong Kong-based bank who deals regularly with UnionPay. “It seems they’re at an expansion phase, so anything goes,” said the executive. “They don’t mind losing money to gain market share. Visa and Mastercard don’t offer anything like that.” “When we asked (UnionPay), ‘Are your international operations making a loss?’ We were told: We don’t look at those numbers,” he added. UnionPay said in a written response to questions about this assertion that its overseas operations were profitable. “UnionPay’s international business growth momentum remains good, and at the moment, it remains in a profitable state,” the company said. Third-party installers such as EasyLink have helped  UnionPay’s expansion by installing its terminals in overseas retail stores.

253,MA,"WRAPUP 6-Putin completes Crimea's annexation, Russia investors take fright","(Adds Rice comment, Canada sanctions, Moscow excludes OSCE from Crimea) * Kremlin to respond to U.S. sanctions in kind * Russian stocks plunge as investors fear wider sanctions * Visa, MasterCard stop processing payments for Russian bank * Europe looks to diversify from Russian gas, oil * EU signs deal with Ukraine, pledges financial help By Steve Gutterman and Adrian Croft MOSCOW/BRUSSELS, March 21 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin signed laws completing Russia’s annexation of Crimea on Friday as investors took fright at a U.S. decision to slap sanctions on his inner circle of money men and security officials. Putin promised to protect a bank partly owned by an old ally, which Washington has blacklisted, and his spokesman said  Russia would respond in kind to the latest financial and visa curbs after producing one blacklist of its own. His allies laughed off the U.S. sanctions, but shares on the Moscow stock exchange - which have lost $70 billion of their value this month - fell sharply after President Barack Obama also threatened to target major sectors of the economy if Russia moved on areas of Ukraine beyond the Black Sea peninsula. Obama’s national security adviser said the world was reassessing its relationship with Russia and Washington was sceptical of Russian assurances that troop movements on the Ukraine border were no more than military exercises. The financial noose began tightening with Visa and MasterCard stopping processing payments for a Russian bank owned by two brothers on the U.S. blacklist. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia might cancel its foreign borrowing for 2014 and raise less domestically if the cost of issuing debt rose. European Union leaders - who like Obama insist Crimea is still part of Ukraine - imposed their own sanctions on 12 people, including Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin and two aides to Putin. Canada sanctioned 14 people. Shaken by the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War, the EU also pledged to cut its reliance on Russian energy and signed a political deal with the pro-Western Ukrainians who took power after Moscow-backed President Viktor Yanukovich’s overthrow last month. In a Kremlin ceremony shown live on state television, Putin signed a law on ratification of a treaty making Crimea part of Russia and another creating two new Russian administrative districts: Crimea and the port city of Sevastopol, where Moscow keeps part of its Black Sea fleet. Thousands of Russians marked the annexation with fireworks and celebrations in Simferopol, capital of Crimea where the  population is around 58 percent ethnic Russian. “Many people wanted this, to go back, not to the USSR, but to that big country of ours,” said Anna Zevetseva, 32. “We are waiting for things to improve and for investment from Russia.” Ukrainian and Tatar residents stayed behind closed doors. Sergey, a 64-year-old Ukrainian businessman who did not want to give his surname, saw no reason to celebrate. “An occupying force is in my country and we have been annexed,” he said. A referendum last Sunday after Russian troops seized control of Crimea overwhelmingly backed union with Russia but was denounced by Washington and the European Union as a sham. It opened the way for annexation within a week. The OSCE European rights and security body finally agreed to send monitors to Ukraine after a delay Western members blamed on Russia, but Moscow said it would have no mandate in Crimea. Obama’s decision to target people who accompanied Putin’s rise from the mayor’s office in St Petersburg in the 1990s to the Russian presidency deepened the diplomatic confrontation. Putin said Bank Rossiya, singled out by Washington as the personal bank for senior Russian officials, had nothing to do with events in Crimea. The St Petersburg-based bank - which is chaired and partly owned by Yuri Kovalchuk, an old associate of Putin’s - mainly serves clients in Russia’s energy sector including businesses owned by state-run gas producer Gazprom. Putin, who says Crimea has exercised its right to self-determination, promised to transfer his wages to Bank Rossiya. “I personally don’t have an account there, but I certainly will open one on Monday,” he told Russia’s Security Council. Others on the U.S. blacklist include oil and commodities trader Gennady Timchenko and the brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, who are linked to big contracts on gas pipelines and the Sochi Olympics, as well as Putin’s chief of staff and his deputy, the head of military intelligence and a railways chief. European leaders also agreed to accelerate their quest for more secure energy supplies at talks on Friday. The EU has made progress in diversifying since crises in 2006 and 2009, when rows over unpaid bills between Kiev and Moscow led to the disruption of gas exports to western Europe.  But Russia still provides around a third of the EU’s oil and gas and 40 percent of the gas goes through Ukraine. European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said member states would help one another to maintain supplies if Moscow cut them. “We are serious about reducing our energy dependency,” he told a news conference at the end of a summit in Brussels. EU countries, which buy Russian gas individually, will also look to negotiate supply deals jointly with Moscow to increase their bargaining power. “It is clear we need to be moving towards an energy union,” said Van Rompuy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the possibility that U.S. shale gas could eventually be an option for European countries seeking to diversify. Obama is expected to address the issue at a summit with EU leaders next Wednesday. Foreign banks and companies now fear the secondary ripple effects of the sanctions. In a worst-case scenario for them, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian clients, similar to the sanctions that were imposed on Iran. “What has been announced so far is really nothing. It’s purely cosmetic,” said a French banker based in Moscow, adding that the biggest risk was to transfers in U.S. dollars, crucial for the energy export-dependent Russian economy. Obama said on Thursday that Washington was also considering sanctions against economic sectors including financial services, oil and gas, metals and mining and the defence industry, if Russia made military moves into eastern and southern Ukraine. In Crimea itself, Ukrainian troops who have been surrounded by Russian forces continued to leave their bases, powerless to halt Moscow’s takeover of the peninsula. “The situation in Ukraine remains unstable and menacing,” said German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, urging the OSCE observers to take up their work as quickly as possible. European governments also took individual action against Russia. Germany suspended approval of all defence-related exports to Russia, ordering contractor Rheinmetall to halt delivery of combat simulation gear, while France called off military cooperation with Moscow. In Brussels, the 28 EU leaders underlined their support for Ukraine’s new leadership, signing a political agreement with interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk. They also promised financial aid for the government - rejected as illegitimate by Moscow - as soon as Kiev reaches a deal with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF is to report next Tuesday on advanced talks with Ukraine on a loan programme that would be linked to far-reaching reforms of the shattered economy. Three months of protests were set off by Yanukovich’s refusal to sign an association agreement with the EU, the political part of which was signed on Friday. Russia’s MICEX stock index fell about 3 percent when trade opened, although it recovered some of the losses later. Promsvyazbank analyst Oleg Shagov said Obama had “opened a Pandora’s box full of sanctions”, with future sanctions to be “directed against whole sectors of the Russian economy”. Negative market sentiment was reinforced by warnings from credit ratings agencies Fitch and S&P; that they were changing their outlooks on Russia to negative from stable because of the possible impact of sanctions on Russia’s economy and business climate. Both agencies presently rate Russia BBB. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev made clear that Russia would step up financial pressure on Ukraine. He said the former Soviet republic should repay Moscow $11 billion under a gas supply contract that should be scrapped because it no longer applied.

254,MA,Appeals court upholds Fed's debit card 'swipe fee' limits,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court upheld the Federal Reserve’s controversial rules for debit card “swipe fees” on Friday, disappointing merchants who had argued the charges were too high. Businesses pay the fees to banks when customers use debit cards to purchase goods or services. The fees reimburse banks for costs involved in offering debit cards. At the instruction of Congress, the Fed in 2011 limited the fees to 21 cents per transaction. A U.S. district court in July 2013 agreed with a group of retailers that lawmakers intended the cap to be lower and overturned the Fed’s rule. The three-member panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the Fed on Friday, saying the law’s “ambiguity” gave regulators leeway to set a higher fee cap. “Because neither agencies nor courts have authority to disregard the demands of even poorly drafted legislation, we must do our best to discern Congress’s intent,” the panel wrote in its opinion. It said the rules “generally rest on reasonable constructions of the statute.” The appeals panel did direct the Fed to better explain the way it treated costs to banks of monitoring transactions for potential fraud. A Fed spokesperson said the agency was pleased with the outcome. The National Retail Federation, whose members include Wal-Mart and JCPenney, and the National Restaurant Association, and other groups sued the Fed in 2011 over the fee cap. Representatives of the groups said they were disappointed with the ruling and were considering appealing the decision. “To have fees that continue to be so unreasonable in the debit card space is detrimental to the folks that we represent as well as ultimately their customers,” said Liz Garner, director of commerce and entrepreneurship at the restaurant group. “We are absolutely considering an appeal. Our lawyers are still kind of digging through the opinion that came out today and seeing what our options are,” she said. The groups could appeal to the full appellate court or directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. Swipe fees, also known as interchange fees, are set by Visa, MasterCard and other card networks. Before Congress intervened, the fees paid by retailers were about 44 cents per transaction. Hoping that lower fees would result in lower prices for consumers, lawmakers called for a cap in the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. They directed the Fed to set a limit that would cover the costs to banks to provide the cards, ignoring any expenses that were not tied to specific debit transactions. The Fed decided network processing fees, costs to monitor transactions for fraud and other expenses were relevant, even though they were not specifically mentioned in the law, and it incorporated them into the 21-cent cap. Merchants argued those costs went beyond what was allowed under the law. The appeals panel said Dodd-Frank’s language was “confusing and its structure convoluted”, but determined that it did leave room for the Fed to consider additional costs. Banks, which opposed capping fees and supported the Fed’s defense of its higher limits, applauded the appeals court’s decision. “Reasonable minds have prevailed in vacating the district court’s ruling to affirm the existing rule,” Richard Hunt, chief executive of the Consumer Bankers Association, a lobby group for banks, said in a statement. “This drawn-out fight should put on notice those members of Congress who insist upon interfering with the free market.” The panel also sided with the Fed on a rule related to networks that process debit transactions. Retailers argued the Fed did not do enough to promote competition among those networks, as Dodd-Frank required. Visa’s shares were up 1.9 percent after the release, while those of MasterCard were down 2.3 percent. The case is NACS v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, 13-5270.

255,MA,Where to find winners (and losers) in foreign stocks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - If you think picking stocks in a single country is tricky, imagine if your job is to find winners and avoid losers around the world. You’d have a big menu to select from, but that could also be a major drawback. Chaos in the Ukraine? Riots in Thailand? You need to be on top of how it will affect portfolios. Greg Dunn faces such challenges every day as co-manager of the $1 billion Thornburg International Growth fund, which won a 2014 U.S. Lipper Fund award for its 3- and 5-year performance in the International Multi-Cap Growth category this year from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company. The fund racked up 23.5 percent 1-year gains through mid-March, clobbering its MSCI EAFE benchmark that lagged with 13.69 percent returns. “We are bottom-up oriented stockpickers. By focusing on finding good businesses, you don’t have to pay a ton of attention to what’s going on in the macro sense,” says Dunn, who first managed domestic portfolios before taking on international markets at Thornburg. In recent years, the fund, managed by Dunn and Tim Cunningham out of Santa Fe, New Mexico, has found those values in the United Kingdom (24 percent of the fund’s portfolio, as of the end of January) and Canada (9.7 percent). The managers are also not afraid of dipping into emerging markets, with 5.5 percent of the fund in Brazilian stocks and 4.2 percent in China. Top holdings include Mastercard Inc and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. Another favorite pick: PriceSmart Inc, the largest operator of membership warehouse clubs in Central America and the Caribbean, which is up almost 40 percent over the past year. Despite the wildfires seemingly lighting all over the globe these days, the international equity category’s robust returns have definitely attracted investors’ attention - in large part due to an extended era of fragile domestic growth. By the end of 2013, total assets in the category had leapt to $1.4 trillion, according to Lipper. That included inflows of $105 billion in 2013, the category’s best year ever for attracting new cash, and a figure that crushed every other equity category. So far this year inflows have continued apace - despite a significant emerging-markets swoon in which Vanguard’s Emerging Markets Stock Index ETF fell by 10 percent over the last year - with another $18 billion being added to the coffers. “With more stability in the euro zone, as well as economic recovery in places like Japan, there has been a nice bounceback for international funds in both 2012 and 2013,” says Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research for S&P; Capital IQ. One potential worry: Since international equities have notched some very impressive years, attractive values could get harder to find. But fund managers say that despite the run-up, they are still managing to locate promising companies at the right price. “Earnings growth has gone up a lot too, so price multiples have not actually changed very much,” says Mark Yockey, one of the portfolio managers for $12.2 billion Artisan International Fund, another of this year’s 2014 U.S. Lipper Fund Award winners. Some of the top names in Yockey’s portfolio: Chinese search engine Baidu Inc and German pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG. The geographic split breaks down to 18 percent of holdings in German companies, 21 percent in the UK, 10 percent in Switzerland and 12 percent in Japan. The result is 1-year returns of 18.27 percent, and eye-popping 5-year returns of 22.58 percent. How has the fund managed such consistency, in foreign markets that can sometimes be wildly volatile? Yockey singles out the taste for long-term, secular investment trends which will not be altered by the headlines of the day. “That could mean anything from the growth of the emerging-markets consumer, to environmental issues in Asia like cleaning up Chinese pollution, to expanded broadband around the world,” he says. The Thornburg and Artisan international funds offer an intriguing contrast in their approach to international investing, notes S&P; Capital IQ’s Rosenbluth. Thornburg International Growth tends to include more small- and mid-cap names, and concentrates on fewer sectors, while Artisan International sticks more to megacaps and spreads its bets between more industry sectors. But even for bottom-up stockpickers who are focused on balance-sheet fundamentals, it is a troubling world out there that remains impossible to predict. In that way, the task of an international fund manager can be likened to walking through a minefield. “There are problems in Egypt, problems in Turkey, and almost everyone seems to have problems with their currencies,” admits Thornburg’s Dunn. “So there are definitely pressures out there. All you can do is own the highest-quality companies you can find.” (The writer is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)

256,MA,"Businesses fear ripple effects from ""cosmetic"" Russian sanctions","PARIS/MOSCOW, March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. and European sanctions against Russia are already having a ripple effect beyond their immediate targets, with Visa and MasterCard  halting payment transaction services for clients of a bank not even on the blacklist. SMP bank’s co-owners are two of the 20 Russians targeted by U.S. President Barack Obama as he tries to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for annexing Crimea. The lender described the move by Visa and MasterCard as unlawful. However, financial services firms are wary of doing business with any person or group that can be linked back to Obama’s blacklist. Banks have paid dearly in the past for violating U.S. sanctions on countries such as Iran, and the threat of broader measures against the Russian economy should Putin threaten southern and eastern Ukraine reinforces their caution. The U.S. sanctions forced Russian billionaire Gennady Timchenko to sell his nearly 50 percent stake in Gunvor, the world’s fourth-largest oil trader, this week but their direct effect has generally been relatively minor so far. What bankers and business people fear is an escalation of measures that would choke off international payments and trade, halt investments and stymie deals. Germany’s main trade body warned on Friday that full-blown economic sanctions would be a “real catastrophe”. In a worst-case scenario, Washington would stop banks doing business with Russian counterparts and corporates, similar to the sort of sanctions that were imposed on Iran. Germany’s “wise men” council of economic advisers said this week that the Ukraine crisis was the biggest threat to growth globally, and especially in Germany, because of Russia’s importance of an energy exporter. “What has been announced so far is really nothing. It’s purely cosmetic,” said a French banker based in Moscow. “The biggest risk is tougher sanctions and really the potential impossibility of transfers in U.S. dollars. That will hit trade finance, which depends on correspondent accounts in dollars,” said the banker, who declined to be named because of official sensitivity around the restrictions. “Being able to make payments in dollars is crucial for the Russian economy, which is dependent on energy exports. It would really hurt us domestically.” Bank exposure to Russia link.reuters.com/xej67v Russia's main trade partners link.reuters.com/jup77v Russia's EU trade ties link.reuters.com/rup77v State-owned Russian banks and companies are expected to repatriate funds from overseas after Putin told them this week to bring their assets home. But foreign bankers in Russia said things would have to deteriorate further before they would reconsider their investments there. “It would have to be a lot worse than this. We are waiting for the response from the Russian side. It’s very difficult to predict,” said another Western banker in Moscow. “I haven’t heard of any Western companies pulling out of Russia. If a company is substantially invested here it will be difficult for them to consider getting out.” Even before the Crimean crisis blew up last month, international banks such as HSBC, Credit Suisse  and Barclays had pulled out of dozens of markets because the risk of falling foul of financial crime rules and sanctions outweighed the returns. The cost to banks of cleaning up an array of misdeeds that have come to light since the global financial crisis, including sanctions busting, has soared to over $100 billion. With that figure expected to climb, Western banks have so far steered clear of attempts by Iran to get them involved in financing humanitarian transactions, despite a diplomatic thaw. With the U.S. and European sanctions so far focused on wealthy individuals close to Putin, private banks which cater to powerful Russians are under the spotlight. Switzerland, the centre of international private banking and a bolt-hole for wealthy Russians, has yet to impose any sanctions but its banks, such as UBS and Credit Suisse, still have to be aware of sanctions when they deal with clients. Beyond banking, big companies such as AstraZeneca  have said they are monitoring the situation in Russia, while doubts are growing over whether smaller firms with less financial flexibility should push ahead with investments in Russia such as building factories. “They are in a wait-and-see mode. But again the timing could be waiting three to six months rather than scrapping the whole thing,” said a second French banker working in Moscow. Vasili Brokvo, the head of communications for Russia’s state defence conglomerate Rostec, made the corporate case for peace. “We hope and our international partners also hope that political differences over certain issues won’t annul or destroy everything we’ve built and all previous agreements with foreign partners will be successfully implemented,” he said on a business trip to Chile this week.

261,MA,WRAPUP 3-NATO commander warns of Russian threat to separatist Moldova region,"(Adds Schaeuble quote, G7 to meet on Monday) * NATO commander warns of threat to Transdniestria * Says Russian force on Ukraine border is “very, very sizeable and very, very ready” * Russian ambassador to EU says Russia has no expansionist views * U.S. Senator John McCain draws parallel between Putin and Hitler * Russian bank SMP says Visa, MasterCard resume processing payments By Adrian Croft and Aleksandar Vasovic BRUSSELS/FEODOSIA, Ukraine, March 23 (Reuters) - NATO’s top military commander said on Sunday Russia had built up a “very sizeable” force on its border with Ukraine and Moscow may have a region in another ex-Soviet republic, Moldova, in its sights after annexing Crimea. Russia was acting more like an adversary than a partner, NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Europe, U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove said, and the 28-nation alliance should rethink the positioning and readiness of its forces in eastern Europe. Russian troops, using armoured vehicles, automatic weapons and stun grenades, seized some of the last military facilities under Ukrainian control on Saturday in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Russian President Vladimir Putin formally annexed the day before. Breedlove was one of several Western officials and politicians to warn on Sunday that Russia may not stop there in a crisis that has taken East-West relations lurching back towards the Cold War since pro-Western protests in Ukraine ousted Moscow-allied President Viktor Yanukovich last month. “The (Russian) force that is at the Ukrainian border now to the east is very, very sizeable and very, very ready,” the NATO commander told an event held by the German Marshall Fund think-tank. U.S. President Barack Obama’s deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said the build-up might just be aimed at intimidating Ukraine’s new pro-Western leaders but that Russia could invade the country’s mainly Russian-speaking east. “It’s possible that they are preparing to move in,” he told CNN. A meeting of the G7 group of industrialised nations has been hastily convened for Monday in the Netherlands to allow leaders to discuss a response to Russia’s actions. Obama will also meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov for bilateral talks. Russia said it was complying with international agreements and had no plans to invade. It has called the soldiers who took over Ukrainian bases in Crimea “self defence forces”. The United States and the European Union have targeted some of Putin’s closest political and business allies with personal sanctions and have threatened broader economic sanctions if Putin’s forces encroach on other eastern or southern parts of Ukraine with big Russian-speaking populations. Germany, which has close trade ties with Russia, said the European Union was united in its readiness to impose sanctions on Russia if necessary, and that Moscow had the most to lose. “None of us wants to escalate, but if Russia changes things unilaterally, then it must know that we won’t accept it and that relations will be bad,” Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told German television. Ukrainian marine standards were still flying on Sunday alongside the Russian flag at the Crimean base of Ukraine’s top military unit in Feodosia, but the Ukrainian troops were getting ready to leave after the Russian military takeover. “Our only issue is that we want to leave this place with honour, weapons and vehicles,” one Ukrainian soldier said. Blinken said Washington was considering all requests for military assistance from the government in Kiev, but that it would be unlikely to prevent an invasion of Ukraine, which is not part of NATO. Breedlove said the military alliance needed to think about its eastern members, particularly the former Soviet Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. “We need to think about our allies, the positioning of our forces in the alliance and the readiness of those forces ... such that we can be there to defend against it if required, especially in the Baltics and other places,” Breedlove said. Breedlove said NATO was very concerned about the threat to Transdniestria, which declared independence from Moldova in 1990 but has not been recognised by any United Nations member state. About 30 percent of its half million population is ethnic Russian and more than half of the total speak Russian as a mother tongue. Russia has 440 peacekeepers in Transdniestria plus other soldiers guarding Soviet-era arms stocks. It launched a new military exercise, involving 8,500 artillery men, near Ukraine’s eastern border 10 days ago. “There is absolutely sufficient (Russian) force postured on the eastern border of Ukraine to run to Transdniestria if the decision was made to do that, and that is very worrisome,” Breedlove said. The speaker of Transdniestria’s parliament has urged Russia to incorporate the region, which lies to the west of Ukraine. The new leaders in Kiev have said Moscow could seek to link up pro-Russian regions in Moldova, and Georgia to Ukraine’s east, in a destabilising southern corridor with Crimea in the middle. Russia’s Deputy Defence Minister Anatoly Antonov was quoted by the state’s Itar-Tass news agency as saying Russia was complying with international agreements limiting the number of troops near its border with Ukraine. Moscow’s ambassador to the European Union, Vladimir Chizhov,  said Russia did not have “expansionist views”. Asked to give a commitment that Russian troops would not move into Ukrainian territory outside Crimea, he told Britain’s BBC. “There is no intention of the Russian Federation to do anything like that.” U.S. Senator John McCain, a Republican foreign policy specialist, told the same BBC show that Putin’s actions in Ukraine were akin to those of Adolf Hitler in 1930s Germany. “I think he (Putin) is calculating how much he can get away with, just as Adolf Hitler calculated how much he could get away with in the 1930s,” McCain said. Germany’s Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier underscored the huge potential repercussions of Russia’s bid to redraw national borders in Europe. “I’m very worried the unlawful attempt to alter recognised borders in our European neighbourhood, 25 years after the end of the Cold War, will open Pandora’s Box,” he said. Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russia, accepted on Sunday that Crimea was now “de facto” a part of Russia, but said the annexation set a “bad precedent”. Western sanctions lost some of their sting on Sunday when Russia’s SMP bank, whose main shareholders were targeted by U.S. sanctions, said Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc had resumed payment services for its clients. The bank said it was glad the two biggest international payments systems had listened to its arguments to reverse Friday’s suspension of services as it was wrong to target the bank, which was not itself subject to any sanctions. Putin and Russian media had mocked the sanctions, which did not stop the Russian military completing its takeover of Ukraine’s military bases in Crimea. Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that its flag was now flying over 189 Ukrainian military installations on the peninsula. The EU emphasised its support for the new pro-Western government in Kiev, signing a political agreement with interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk last week. It also promised financial aid for the government - which Moscow says came to power by a coup to overthrow Yanukovich after he rejected an EU trade deal in favour of closer ties with Russia - as soon as Kiev reaches a deal with the International Monetary Fund. The IMF will report on Tuesday.

262,MA,"UPDATE 1-Russian bank SMP says Visa, MasterCard resume payment services","(Adds Mastercard, Visa comment) MOSCOW, March 23 (Reuters) - Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc have resumed services for payment transactions for clients at Russia’s SMP bank, whose main shareholders were affected by U.S. sanctions, the bank said on Sunday. Washington imposed additional sanctions on Thursday against 20 Russians for involvement in the Ukraine crisis, including Boris Rotenberg and his older brother Arkady, who received large contracts for the Sochi Winter Olympics. They are co-owners of SMP Bank. SMP had said on Friday that Visa and MasterCard had stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at SMP bank, which has about 100 branches covering more than 20 Russian cities, according to its website. A spokesperson for Mastercard confirmed it was again serving clients of the bank but did not say why it reversed its decision. Visa said it had been informed by the U.S. government to lift sanctions against SMP bank and two other Russian banks because they did not meet the criteria for sanctions. “All cards issued by these banks will return to normal operation as soon as possible,” it said in a statement. Visa’s statement named the other two banks as Investitsionny Soyuz (Investment Union) and InvestKapitalBank. SMP bank had said the decision to stop providing services by Visa and MasterCard was unlawful because the sanctions were imposed on shareholders, not the bank, which said it has no assets in the United States. “We are glad that the two biggest international payment systems have heard our arguments and reversed their decision to block (SMP bank transactions),” SMP bank CEO Dmitry Kalantyrsky, said in a statement.

265,MA,"Russia renews plan for domestic alternative to Visa, Mastercard","MOSCOW, March 26 (Reuters) - Russia has revived plans to develop its own card payment system to cut its dependence on Visa and Mastercard after U.S. sanctions led to disruptions in their services, its finance minister said on Wednesday. Visa and MasterCard last week stopped providing services for payment transactions for clients at Bank Rossiya, which was hit by U.S. sanctions over Moscow’s involvement in a crisis in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea. The two payment systems also suspended services for clients at several other banks whose shareholders, but not the banks, are on the U.S. list. They resumed services after the U.S. government said these banks did not meet criteria for sanctions. “The payments restriction by Visa and Mastercard at one bank made us start thinking very seriously how we can secure ourselves against this kind of cases,” Anton Siluanov said in an interview on the Rossiya 24 channel. The “backup” national payment system would operate only on Russian territory, he said. Siluanov said the ministry and Russian banks were preparing proposals and these would be implemented in the near future. “Nevertheless, we believe that there is no serious reason to say that we should abandon the existing systems, especially Visa and Mastercard, but in parallel we will begin to focus more on developing our own settlement system,” he said.

266,MA,Wal-Mart sues Visa for $5 billion over card swipe fees,"(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc this week sued Visa Inc for $5 billion, accusing the credit and debit card network of excessively high card swipe fees, several months after the retailer opted out of a class action settlement between merchants and Visa and MasterCard Inc. Visa declined to comment on the suit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, where Wal-Mart is headquartered. Visa and other card networks charge retailers fees, called swipe fees or interchange fees, each time a shopper uses a debit or credit card to pay. In December, a federal judge in Brooklyn, N.Y., approved a $5.7 billion class action settlement between merchants and Visa and MasterCard despite the objections of thousands of retailers that complained it was inadequate. Wal-Mart, Amazon.com Inc, and Target Corp were among those opting out of the monetary components of the settlement to have the freedom to seek damages on their own. Those businesses complained about a broad litigation release in the settlement. The release forces all merchants who accepted Visa or MasterCard, and those who will in the future, to give up their right to sue the credit card companies over rules at issue in the case or similar ones they may make in the future. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, is seeking damages from price fixing and other antitrust violations that it claims took place between January 1, 2004 and November 27, 2012. In its lawsuit, Wal-Mart contends that Visa, in concert with banks, sought to prevent retailers from protecting themselves against those swipe fees, eventually hurting sales. “The anticompetitive conduct of Visa and the banks forced Wal-Mart to raise retail prices paid by its customers and/or reduce retail services provided to its customers as a means of offsetting some of the artificially inflated interchange fees,” Wal-Mart in court documents. “As a result, Wal-Mart’s retail sales were below what they would have been otherwise.” When asked whether Wal-Mart would file a suit against Mastercard, a spokesman for the retailer said the company would not discuss its litigation plans publicly. Wal-Mart contends that that the way Visa set swipe fees violated antitrust regulations and generated more than $350 billion for card issuers over the nearly 9-year period in question, in part at the expense of the retailer and customers.

268,MA,Retailers push into crowded mobile payment market,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Big retailers are muscling in on the likes of Visa, MasterCard and Google in a fiercely competitive and growing mobile payment market that promises to cut transaction costs and increase customer loyalty. Stores such as British supermarket Tesco and France’s Auchan hope their “digital wallets” - apps which allow users to pay with their smartphones rather than cash or cards - will also give them more comprehensive data about customers’ shopping habits than ever before so they can target advertising. They are joining a crowded market - banks, card companies and tech firms like Google and Apple are all entering the mobile payment business, each hoping their app will become the industry standard. eBay’s PayPal, well established in e-commerce, is also experimenting with the technology. Retailers hope to attract customers to their own services by giving discounts and rewards to those using them, while also linking payments automatically to loyalty schemes and offering features like saved shopping lists. The global market for mobile payments is forecast to grow about threefold by 2017 to some $721 billion worth of transactions, with more than 450 million users, according to research firm Gartner. The growth could benefit retailers as the competition from a host of payment providers should help drive down the fees stores pay to have transactions processed - a service currently dominated by banks and card firms Visa and MasterCard. “We view merchants as overall beneficiaries of the trend toward mobile payments,” said Morgan Stanley, which estimated retailers in developed countries spent up to $150 billion in 2012 to accept card payments. “Expected returns should justify any incremental investments required in enabling mobile payments technology,” it said in a report in January. However, it is still unclear how the retail mobile payment market will develop, with card companies and banks seen retaining a leading role in processing payments even if physical cards become obsolete. Retailers’ apps might struggle to take off as customers are unlikely to be willing to use a variety of services for different stores, but the success of Starbucks Corp in combining mobile payments with promotions shows big players can succeed. Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee chain, launched its mobile payment and rewards app in 2011. It already has 10 million users and the firm said this month it is looking for ways to expand the program beyond its own network. “The mobile payments platform has given us a higher degree of frequency and higher degree of loyalty and the question is how can we leverage that beyond our stores,” Starbucks Chairman and Chief Executive Howard Schultz told CNBC television. An alternative path is also being explored in the United States, where dozens of top retailers including Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy have announced plans to set up a joint digital wallet service - the Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX - though no launch date has been set. Meanwhile, an attempt to create a mobile payment app universally accepted by retailers has recently launched in Germany. Yapital, owned by e-commerce firm Otto, has gone live in thousands of stores and also allows users to pay online and make peer-to-peer transfers. Yapital Chairman Nils Winkler expects just a few players to survive of the 200 initiatives now clamoring for attention in Europe, with apps tied to retailers more likely to win out than those being developed by telecom and card firms. “The biggest success in this field will be retail-based. PayPal is a good example that has grown tremendously based on the retail success of eBay,” he said. Tesco, the world’s third-largest retailer which pioneered the tracking of customer behavior with its Clubcard loyalty card two decades ago, will launch its digital wallet this year, as it also starts offering current accounts. That is part of the British supermarket chain’s eventual plan to use smartphones - and its own-brand Hudl tablet computers - to allow customers to navigate stores with their devices and scan products to buy them as they shop. Sophie Albizua, co-founder of UK-based retail consultancy eNova Partnership, said her clients were ready to invest in overhauling outdated till systems to enable mobile payments. “People spent the last five to 10 years fine-tuning their websites. Now they have time to focus on something else.” French supermarket group Auchan, Europe’s fifth-biggest retailer, launched its “Flash and Pay” electronic wallet about a year ago. It combines payments with coupons, loyalty cards, receipts and a shopping list feature. “Our objective is to minimize costs. To have alternatives to existing solutions. All other solutions try to make costs for merchants,” Arnaud Crouzet, Auchan head of global payments, told the Merchant Payments Ecosystem conference in Berlin. “It is difficult to imagine our data on our customers going through a third party,” he added. Britain’s Centre for Economics and Business Research said there was a clear business case for digital wallets in terms of reduced costs and improved customer service and sales. UK retailers could have saved 463 million pounds ($770 million) in transaction costs in 2013 by shifting to mobile payments from cash, credit and charge cards, it estimates. Mobile payments could reduce queue length in stores by speeding users through tills and cut the cost of handling cash and card payments, it said. Handling cash - which accounts for over half retail transactions by volume in Britain - is costly for retailers as it needs to be counted and guarded, costs equivalent to about 2.5 percent of takings, compared with about 2 percent for processing cheques and 1 percent for debit and credit cards. However Carrefour, the world’s second biggest retailer after Wal-Mart, thinks shoppers need more time to be convinced. “For the moment, cards are still a good solution, especially contactless ones,” said Frederic Mazurier, a vice-president for finance and risk management at Carrefour Banque. “It is going to take quite a few years more.” ($1 = 0.6011 British pounds) ",4062014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-mobilepayment/retailers-push-into-crowded-mobile-payment-market-idUSBREA3503X20140406

An alternative path is also being explored in the United States, where dozens of top retailers including Wal-Mart , Target and Best Buy have announced plans to set up a joint digital wallet service - the Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX - though no launch date has been set. Meanwhile, an attempt to create a mobile payment app universally accepted by retailers has recently launched in Germany. Yapital, owned by e-commerce firm Otto, has gone live in thousands of stores and also allows users to pay online and make peer-to-peer transfers. Yapital Chairman Nils Winkler expects just a few players to survive of the 200 initiatives now clamouring for attention in Europe, with apps tied to retailers more likely to win out than those being developed by telecom and card firms. “The biggest success in this field will be retail-based. PayPal is a good example that has grown tremendously based on the retail success of eBay,” he said. Tesco, the world’s third-largest retailer which pioneered the tracking of customer behaviour with its Clubcard loyalty card two decades ago, will launch its digital wallet this year, as it also starts offering current accounts.

Now they have time to focus on something else.” French supermarket group Auchan, Europe’s fifth-biggest retailer, launched its “Flash and Pay” electronic wallet about a year ago. It combines payments with coupons, loyalty cards, receipts and a shopping list feature. “Our objective is to minimise costs. To have alternatives to existing solutions.

270,MA,RPT-Retailers push into crowded mobile payment market,"(Repeats story published on Sunday, with no changes) * Mobile payments market seen growing threefold by 2017 * Retailers spend $150 bln a year on card-based payments * Opportunity to monetise data on consumer behaviour * Mobile payments can cut retailers’ costs, boost service-study * Starbucks payment/reward app already has 10 million users By Emma Thomasson BERLIN, April 6 (Reuters) - Big retailers are muscling in on the likes of Visa, MasterCard and Google  in a fiercely competitive and growing mobile payment market that promises to cut transaction costs and increase customer loyalty. Stores such as British supermarket Tesco and France’s Auchan hope their “digital wallets” - apps which allow users to pay with their smartphones rather than cash or cards - will also give them more comprehensive data about customers’ shopping habits than ever before so they can target advertising. They are joining a crowded market - banks, card companies and tech firms like Google and Apple are all entering the mobile payment business, each hoping their app will become the industry standard. eBay’s PayPal, well established in e-commerce, is also experimenting with the technology. Retailers hope to attract customers to their own services by giving discounts and rewards to those using them, while also linking payments automatically to loyalty schemes and offering features like saved shopping lists. The global market for mobile payments is forecast to grow about threefold by 2017 to some $721 billion worth of transactions, with more than 450 million users, according to research firm Gartner. The growth could benefit retailers as the competition from a host of payment providers should help drive down the fees stores pay to have transactions processed - a service currently dominated by banks and card firms Visa and MasterCard. “We view merchants as overall beneficiaries of the trend toward mobile payments,” said Morgan Stanley, which estimated retailers in developed countries spent up to $150 billion in 2012 to accept card payments. “Expected returns should justify any incremental investments required in enabling mobile payments technology,” it said in a report in January. However, it is still unclear how the retail mobile payment market will develop, with card companies and banks seen retaining a leading role in processing payments even if physical cards become obsolete. Retailers’ apps might struggle to take off as customers are unlikely to be willing to use a variety of services for different stores, but the success of Starbucks Corp in combining mobile payments with promotions shows big players can succeed.

273,MA,"NY state joins with Visa, MasterCard to curb payday lending","(Reuters) - New York state’s main banking regulator said on Wednesday it had teamed up with card payment companies Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc to curb illegal payday loans through debit card transactions. The Department of Financial Services said it would provide information to the card companies about payday lenders that might be using debit networks to recover illegal loans. Visa and MasterCard will then take action to block these transactions, the department said. ""By working with us to root out this illegal conduct, Visa and MasterCard have stepped up to the plate and shown how private companies can work alongside state government to protect vulnerable New Yorkers,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. (link.reuters.com/tab98v) Benjamin Lawsky, the state’s superintendent of financial services, also sent cease-and-desist letters to 20 additional payday lenders, the department said. Payday loans, which are short-term borrowings, are usually taken by employees before they get their paychecks and are paid when they receive their salaries. Annual interest rates on these loans, taken mostly by low-income workers, can vary between 100 percent and 650 percent.

275,MA,MasterCard sees threat in Putin's plans for Russian payment cards,"(Reuters) - MasterCard Inc (MA.N), the world’s second-biggest credit and debit card company, said Russian President Vladimir Putin’s plan to create a domestic card payment system would create “serious complications” for its operations in the country. Putin, lashing back against U.S. and EU sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine, has said Russia needs its own card system to reduce its reliance on Western companies. Russia’s parliament passed legislation last week that would allow for the creation of domestic credit and debit cards as well as require Western card companies to pay a security deposit to operate in the country. MasterCard and larger rival Visa Inc (V.N) stopped providing services to some Russian banks after U.S. President Barack Obama imposed sanctions on Russia in March. “There are provisions (in the legislation) there that I believe would create serious complications for the way that we can operate in (Russia),” MasterCard Chief Executive Ajay Banga said on a post-earnings call with analysts on Thursday. “Russia will be tough to work through,” said Banga, a self-described “worrier”. MasterCard’s Russian operations account for just over 2 percent to its total net revenue, and the company said the sanctions had little impact on its first-quarter results. However, a competing card system in the fast-growing Russian market would likely constrain future growth for both MasterCard and Visa, analysts say. Visa said last week that the sanctions were already hurting its card transaction volumes in Russia and that it expected revenue growth to slow further this quarter. MasterCard, whose shares rose as much as 4.3 percent in morning trading, said its net income rose 14 percent to $870 million, or 73 cents per share, in the quarter. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 72 cents per share. The company also stuck to its forecast of net revenue growth of between 11 percent and 14 percent between 2013 and 2015. MasterCard’s worldwide purchase volume increased 10 percent in local currency terms to $759 billion, with much of the growth coming from Latin America, Asia and Europe. U.S. purchase volumes rose 9 percent to $268 billion. Global consumer confidence returned to pre-financial crisis levels in the first three months of this year, according to a survey by research company Nielsen, and was at its highest since the first quarter of 2007. MasterCard’s net revenue rose about 14 percent to $2.18 billion in the three months ended March 31, beating the average estimate of $2.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s shares were up 2.3 percent at $75.26 in early afternoon trading.

Russia’s parliament passed a law in April to oblige foreign card companies to pay a security deposit of 25 percent of their average daily turnover in Russia to the central bank once a quarter from July 1. Both Visa and Mastercard - the world’s two largest credit and debit card companies - had protested against the new rules, saying they would create significant complications for their business in Russia. “The problem of reaching an agreement (on the security deposit) will be handed over to the central bank or government,” the source told journalists on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum when asked if the rules would be relaxed. “Visa said it has taken the decision not to pay a cent,” the source added. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov later told journalists he would meet representatives from Visa and Mastercard on Friday.

Russia’s parliament in April introduced legislation demanding the credit companies make a hefty security deposit to the central bank, a response to sanctions imposed on Moscow over its involvement in Ukraine. The Russian finance ministry, the central bank and local bankers have described the law as excessive and on Friday a meeting between government officials and the companies’ executives produced promises that both companies will stay. “We are willing to work in Russia and after this meeting we hope that a compromise solution will be found,” Andrew Torre, director of Visa in Russia, told reporters on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Ilya Ryaby, general director of Mastercard in Russia, said his company would stay in Russia but that “the decision (on whether to relax the rules) depends first of all on the agreement of the president of the Russian Federation.” Amendments to the law, relaxing the requirements, will be prepared next week, Kremlin’s top economic aide Andrei Belousov told Russian news agencies. “We will introduce changes to the legislation, we’re looking at different options now,” Belousov was cited as saying. The rules, set to come into force on July 1, oblige foreign card companies to pay a security deposit of 25 percent of their average daily turnover in Russia to the central bank once a quarter. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told reporters that Visa and Mastercard had proposed creating their own Russia-based payment systems but that these plans would take around a year and a half to develop. In the meantime they would work with Russia’s existing payment systems, he said. “We are willing to cooperate in this direction,” Siluanov said. “I think we will find a solution that suits both Visa and Mastercard and the Russian Federation.” Visa and Mastercard stopped serving several Russian banks after the United States imposed sanctions over the annexation of Crimea in March, prompting criticism from President Vladimir Putin. Russia later launched a package of measures aimed at stimulating the creation of a Russian national payment system and reducing its reliance on Western companies.

The move follows several data breaches at U.S. companies including one at Target Corp late last year involving the theft of about 40 million credit and debit card records. “The move by MasterCard just enhances the sense of security for people at a time when it has been shaken up significantly in recent times”, said Gil Luria, an analyst with Wedbush Securities Inc. Zero-liability protection currently covers card transactions that require a customer’s signature but does not apply if an account holder’s personal identification number (PIN) was used for unauthorized transactions. The new policy will take effect in October. Zero-liability protection means the account holder will not be held responsible for unauthorized transactions. Larger rival Visa Inc’s zero-liability policy does not apply to PIN-based and ATM transactions, according to information available on the company’s website. “The changes that we’re making in cardholder protection combined with our efforts to move the U.S. payments industry to EMV chip technology will help deliver safer shopping experiences to consumers,” said Chris McWilton, president, North American Markets for MasterCard. The two companies have urged banks and retailers to meet an October 2015 deadline for the adoption of “EMV” chip technology that would make it safer to pay with plastic. “This all comes back to the adoption of EMV. Of all the cards that are breached at ATMs, a majority of them are non-EMV cards. This is just another way for the company to impress upon the importance of quickly adopting EMV cards,” said Philip Philliou, managing partner of Philliou Partners LLC, a firm that helps banks and retailers select payment processors. U.S. cards issued by MasterCard will also carry identity theft resolution assistance, which helps cancel missing cards, alert credit reporting agencies and conduct searches to detect if stolen confidential data appears online, MasterCard said on Wednesday. The financial impact from the extension of the coverage is expected to be minimal for MasterCard, according to Luria. MasterCard shares were little changed at $77.17 in late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

286,MA,Understanding MasterCard's pledge of zero liability,"(Reuters) - In the wake of a spate of data breaches highlighting the vulnerability of companies that hold consumer information, MasterCard Inc announced last week it would apply the same rules to PIN-based debit card transactions as those used for credit cards: zero liability when fraud is reported. “Fraud and identity theft have been in the news a lot lately. We want to give cardholders peace of mind,” says MasterCard spokeswoman Beth Kitchener. The breach at Target last year, which affected more than 40 million customers, is still a top concern for many.  For consumers who have MasterCard-branded debit cards, the extension of zero liability means some things will change, while others won’t. Here is what you need to know about the new policy, which takes effect on Oct. 1. Q: Does this mean that using a debit card is just as safe for transactions as using a credit card? A: Not exactly. While those who have MasterCard-branded debit cards will benefit from the policy change, the inherent issues with debit cards remain. The main difference between debit card and credit card transactions is debit cards are tied to users’ bank accounts. “With credit cards, it’s not a big deal. It’s their money not yours,” says Gerri Detweiler, director of consumer education for Credit.com. “With a debit card it is a big deal. Consumers still need to be very careful when a debit card is tied to their main financial account.” Q: How much money could I be on the hook for right now if  someone steals using my debit card? A: Federal laws extend protection to consumers using both credit and debit cards, but losses for victims of fraudulent credit card transactions are capped at $50. Most credit card issuers, however, set the cap at zero. Responsibility for fraud on a debit card is tied to when it is discovered and reported. If you report the loss within two days, federal law caps consumer responsibility at $50. If you report it within 60 days of receiving a statement that shows the fraudulent transactions, liability is capped at $500. If you don’t report it within 60 days, that liability is unlimited. Q: Why isn’t a PIN enough to protect me? A: Theoretically, using a PIN protects the cardholder because it’s a secure password. However, card skimmers can steal numbers, and some people use PINs that are easy to figure out. Javelin Research & Strategy, which analyzes banking and fraud, found that about 10 percent of identity fraud victims had their debit card PIN taken. That works out to more than 1.2 million cards. Q. How do I get money restored to my account if it is stolen? A: You should contact your bank as soon as you learn your account has been compromised, says MasterCard’s Kitchener. Call the phone number on the back of your card or the financial institution that issued the card. How quickly the money is restored varies from bank to bank. Q. What’s the biggest issue for consumers when someone commits fraud with their debit card? A: Getting back the money in a timely fashion. Only about a quarter of the leading financial institutions offer to make money lost to fraud available in bank accounts the day after it is reported, according to Javelin. However, that one quarter includes some of the largest banks in the country: JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America. Q. What are the exceptions to the zero liability rule? A: There is one exclusion for exercising “reasonable care in safeguarding your card.” Consumer experts complain that this is not very specific. “Reasonable can have variable definitions depending on who you ask,”  says John Ulzheimer, credit expert for CreditSesame.com. Kitchener says it’s up to individual financial institutions to determine what would be considered a violation of the “reasonable care” rule. An example, says Detweiler, would be giving your card and password to someone to buy a gallon of milk and ended up spending $200. Or writing your PIN on the card. Q. Is this policy change a good thing for consumers? A: Credit experts say that it is. “Certainly the notion that certain transactions weren’t covered by zero liability was confusing to the consumer,” Detweiler says. “It’s great that they’re simplifying that for their customers and covering all transactions.” Given that so many consumers use debit cards as a way to control spending - using their own cash rather than borrowing on a credit card - Ulzheimer says any effort to protect users is beneficial. “By and large this is a good thing for consumers who choose debit over credit,” he says. “It lets them keep their budgetary controls in place while worrying less about fraud.” (The author is a Reuters contributor.

288,MA,MasterCard expects big growth from 'big data' insights,"BERLIN (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc, the world’s second-largest debit and credit card company, sees business booming from selling data to retailers, banks and governments on spending patterns found in the payments it processes, a top executive told Reuters. MasterCard, which handles payments for 2 billion cardholders and tens of millions of merchants, uses that information to generate real-time data on consumer trends, available more quickly that regular government statistics. “It is an incredibly fast growing area for us,” Ann Cairns, who heads MasterCard’s business outside North America, said in an interview, stressing that the company respects cardholder privacy, using anonymous data rather than personal information. MasterCard does not give figures for its information services products but “other revenues”, which include the sale of data, grew 22 percent in the first quarter of 2014 to $341 million, outpacing the growth of total revenue dominated by payments processing, which rose 14 percent to $2.177 billion.  Cairns said clients for the data include retailers, banks and governments, with MasterCard tailoring it to their needs. “Retailers are fantastic at using the data they have available about how people shop in their store, how their inventory turns over, but what they don’t know is what happens outside their store,” she said. “The data we’ve got is ubiquitous across the whole market. We can help retailers see what they need to do to capture more sales.” Cairns, 57, a statistician by training who joined MasterCard in 2011 after helping manage the disposal of Lehman Brothers assets in Europe, revels in the insights real-time card data can provide, such as London’s popularity as the world’s top travel destination and a rise in spending on experiences such as eating out or going on holiday rather than shopping in stores. MasterCard has recorded a spike in spending in Brazil on groceries and a drop in spending on luxury goods as the price of food has risen ahead of the World Cup, she said, the kind of insight valued by companies such as Nike and Adidas that are hoping to sell $300 soccer boots during the competition. GROWTH IN E-COMMERCE, EMERGING MARKETS While MasterCard expands in “big data”, Cairns sees no slowdown in its traditional business of processing payments, with plenty of potential for growth as 85 percent of consumer transactions are still made by cash or cheque. “Moving money and doing it safely and securely is so deeply cared about by so many people around the world that it will be a business that has fantastic value now and for years to come,” said Cairns, who previously worked at Citigroup and ABN Amro. London-based Cairns, whose division accounts for 60 percent of MasterCard’s business, said the expansion of e-commerce and emerging markets is driving growth, noting that 2.5 billion people are still without access to financial services. She predicted that shoppers in many developing economies will leapfrog plastic cards and go direct to payment via smartphone - adding MasterCard is providing “digital wallet” technology to retailers and banks and does not see their own moves into the payments field as a competitive threat. She also played down the challenge from other new rivals such as Kenya’s money transfer service M-Pesa, owned by Safaricom, and eBay’s online payments unit PayPal, which is trying to move into physical transactions. “We run at such a sub-infrastructure level around the world. It is very difficult to replicate our network,” she said, adding that M-Pesa had built a branch network to receive and make payments in Kenya, but that would not work in countries where there is more established financial infrastructure. “Most counties in the world have ATM networks and point of sale networks. Because they are so ubiquitous, that model won’t fly,” she said. Meanwhile, MasterCard is entrenching its technology in other emerging markets, for example developing a biometrics-based card used for benefits payments in South Africa and working with the Nigeria government on a pilot to overlay payment technology on a new national identity card.

289,MA,MasterCard seeks Russian partner as regulations tighten,"* Local partner could help MasterCard bypass new rules * Visa says Russia’s planned security deposit won’t work * Rule changes part of plan for national payment system * Russia a small mkt for MasterCard, Visa but offers growth By Alexander Winning and Oksana Kobzeva MOSCOW, June 17 (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc said on Tuesday it was seeking a Russian partner to process payments made within the country, a move that could help it bypass new rules imposed on foreign card companies in the wake of Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. Its main competitor, Visa Inc, meanwhile, reiterated its position that the obligation to pay a hefty security deposit to the central bank - the most onerous of the new requirements - was “unworkable.” Both companies considered quitting Russia after President Vladimir Putin signed the rules into law in early May but said they would stay after officials showed a willingness to relax the requirements. The Russian finance ministry, the central bank and local bankers have criticised the law, which was passed after Visa and MasterCard stopped serving several Russian banks targeted by recent Western sanctions and forms part of a plan to develop a national payment system to reduce Russia’s reliance on the West. Mastercard said on Tuesday it had launched a tender to find a partner to perform clearing, authorisation and settlement services for its Russian operations and that the partner should have a processing centre within Russia - another of the new requirements. “We share the goal of the Russian government to decrease the volume of cash turnover in favour of electronic transactions,” Ilya Ryaby, director of MasterCard in Russia, said in a statement. Visa welcomed a move to delay until October the obligation to pay quarterly security deposits of 25 percent of a card company’s average daily turnover in Russia to the central bank but said the requirement was still “unworkable and goes beyond what we are willing to do.” Morgan Stanley analysts estimated in a report in May that Visa and Mastercard would be required to post around $1.9 billion and $1 billion in collateral, respectively, once the rules take effect. They said the overall earnings impact would be limited if they were to leave Russia, given that the country accounts for less than 4 percent of both companies’ revenues globally. Amendments to the deposit rules are due to be discussed in Russia’s lower house of parliament later this week, and analysts expect a compromise solution to be reached. Between them, Visa and MasterCard account for over 90 percent of the credit and debit cards issued in Russia, meaning that their exit would seriously complicate the lives of many ordinary Russians. Although in terms of revenues Russia remains a minor market for both companies, the country’s credit card system is developing fast and its 140 million population could offer greater growth potential than developed countries. Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev told Reuters the law would likely be amended so the government would be able to waive the requirement to demand security deposits from international card companies if certain conditions were met. “The work of international (payment) systems through a Russian services provider provides the notion of uninterrupted services and could fall under a rule to cancel the security deposit,” Moiseev said. A spokesman for Visa declined comment on whether the company also planned to find a Russian partner to comply with the new rules. The central bank, which is still interpreting how the rules will be implemented, also declined comment.

Retailers such as Target Corp and Amazon.com Inc  have accused Visa and MasterCard of fixing the fees charged to merchants each time their customers used credit or debit cards. They also alleged the two companies prevented merchants from steering customers to cheaper forms of payment. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson of Brooklyn said on Friday the lawsuits could proceed, according to Jeffrey Shinder, an attorney for some of the retailers. Shinder declined further comment. In December, Gleeson approved an estimated $5.7 billion settlement between the two credit card companies and a nationwide class of merchants over similar allegations. But thousands of retailers, including some of the biggest in the United States such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, opted out of the settlement, complaining it was not adequate. Those companies argued the settlement offered meaningless reforms that would not help them control the costs of accepting credit cards. Many of those retailers who objected to the settlement filed their own lawsuits. A spokesman for MasterCard said in a statement that Gleeson’s ruling on Friday was at earliest stage of the case. “We look forward to putting this matter behind us and continuing to work productively with the merchant community,” he said.

July 29 (Reuters) - American Express Co reported a 9 percent rise in quarterly profit that matched analysts’ estimates as more customers used its credit cards in a recovering U.S. economy. Card member spending rose 9 percent globally, after adjusting for foreign currency, compared to 7 percent growth in the preceding quarter and 8 percent growth in the second quarter last year. “The strong underlying performance this quarter reflected a continuation of some familiar themes: higher card member spending, credit metrics at or near their historic lows, a modest increase in loan balances,” Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Chenault said in a statement. U.S. consumer spending picked up in the second quarter after an usually harsh winter dampened sales in the first quarter. American Express, which mostly issues its own cards unlike Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc that work through banks, benefits from its largely affluent customers’ consistent spending and low rates of default. AmEx’s net income rose to $1.53 billion, or $1.43 per share, for the second quarter ended June 30, from $1.41 billion, or $1.27 per share, a year earlier.

Net income for the second quarter also included a gain of $626 million from the spinoff into a joint venture of AmEx’s business travel operations.

301,MA,MasterCard's cross-border card fees in the dock on Thursday,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe’s top court will rule on Thursday whether MasterCard’s (MA.N) cross-border card fees, a lucrative revenue source for the financial industry and the subject of a decade-long battle with EU regulators, are anti-competitive. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have cracked down on so-called payment card interchange fees, saying they are too high and cost consumers and retailers billions of euros a year. While Thursday’s ruling applies only to MasterCard and its cross-border fees within the European Economic Area, it could set the tone for attempts to cap similar charges for card payments across the board within Europe. MasterCard’s regulatory troubles started in 2003 when the European Commission said its cross-border fees within Europe hampered competition. Four years, later the commission ordered MasterCard to withdraw them. The fees are set by payment card companies and collected by banks. When a Spanish credit card is used in a French store, for example, the bank used by the French shop owner has to pay the bank in Spain a percentage of the transaction. The Commission ruled that such fees inflated prices merchants charged customers to accept payment cards, and this restriction on price competition harmed companies and consumers. MasterCard temporarily withdrew the fees in 2008 but came to an agreement in 2009 to charge them again, but with caps of 0.2 percent for debit cards and 0.3 percent for credit cards. The company’s bigger rival Visa Europe agreed to similar limits on cross-border card transactions within Europe earlier this year to settle an EU investigation.  Thursday’s ruling is the end of long legal road. MasterCard challenged the initial European Commission 2007 ruling in a lower court, and lost in 2012. It then went to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ).  In January, an ECJ adviser backed the Commission’s push to cut such charges. While the opinion is non-binding, judges follow such recommendations in most cases.  While MasterCard’s capped fees for cross-border transactions should not be affected if it loses the case, such a ruling could encourage regulators pushing for similar caps across the board in Europe, in a bid to boost e-commerce and cut business costs. In July 2013, European financial regulators proposed 0.2/0.3 percent caps for all cross-border card transactions, as well as for payments in the same country a card was issued. The proposals have yet to be approved by the European Parliament and the 28 EU countries and could still be modified due to heavy lobbying from banks and other parties. Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority is also investigating fees charged by MasterCard and Visa for domestic card payments. It has put its inquiry on hold, pending the outcome of Thursday’s MasterCard ruling. MasterCard handles payments for 2 billion cardholders and tens of millions of merchants. Visa Europe is the European licensee of Visa (V.N).  The case is C-382/12 MasterCard versus the Commission.

The Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) said that a lower court’s decision in 2012 to uphold the European Commission’s initial findings against MasterCard in 2007 was correct. “The Court of Justice confirms the judgment of the General Court and thus validates the Commission’s decision prohibiting the multilateral interchange fees applied by MasterCard,” judges wrote in their ruling. The world’s second-largest credit and debit card company behind Visa came under regulatory fire more than a decade ago over its fees, which are a lucrative source of revenue. Since the Commission’s 2007 veto, MasterCard has reached a deal with regulators to cap fees for cross-border transactions within Europe at 0.2 percent for debit cards and 0.3 percent for credit cards. MasterCard said it was disappointed with Thursday’s decision but that it would not affect business. “We will continue to comply with the decision as we have been doing for a number of years. This means we would maintain our European cross-border consumer interchange fees at a weighted average of 0.2 percent for debit and 0.3 percent for credit,” the company’s President Javier Perez said. The ruling should spur European lawmakers and governments to agree to a Commission-proposed cap on credit and debit fees throughout the EU, which has been in limbo since it was unveiled last year, said Ruth Milligan of EU retail lobby EuroCommerce. It was a complaint from EuroCommerce in 1997 that triggered the EU investigation into MasterCard. The court verdict could also prompt Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority to revive its examination of fees charged by MasterCard and Visa Europe for domestic card payments. The investigation was suspended pending the outcome of the EU case.   The case is C-382/12 MasterCard versus the Commission.

305,MA,UPDATE 1-Indian card payment network RuPay sees boost from government banking scheme,"(Adds Visa comment in 13th and 14th paragraphs) By Devidutta Tripathy MUMBAI, Sept 11 (Reuters) - A government drive to expand banking services in India is giving a boost to home-grown card payment network RuPay, which expects to quadruple the number of users by March and make debit cards more acceptable in a nation where cash is still king. Started in 2012 by a company owned by 10 local and foreign banks, RuPay competes with global payment firms Visa Inc  and MasterCard Inc for the few customers in Asia’s third largest economy able to afford a debit or credit card. As of July, banks issued just under 435 million payment cards in India, a nation of 1.3 billion people. Most were debit cards. RuPay’s share of daily card transactions, however, remains small compared with the global firms, which are more established, offer both debit and credit cards and are accepted by more retailers. RuPay currently offers only debit cards. RuPay users account for just 1.5 percent of daily card transactions of almost one million at retailers, said A.P. Hota, chief executive of the National Payments Corp of India (NPCI), which runs RuPay. Hota told Reuters the payments network was set to grow rapidly from the government’s so-called financial inclusion scheme, which aims to ensure the majority of households has a bank account within months. Under the scheme launched late in August, Indians who open a bank account for the first time automatically get a RuPay card. Hota said the number of RuPay users has now almost doubled from 23 million at the end of July. By March next year, he expects that number to rise to 160 million, with more than 60 percent of the increase coming from the government scheme. “Jan Dhan itself would provide a big opportunity for the domestic card brand to be a formidable force,” said Hota, referring to the financial inclusion scheme, Jan Dhan Yojana, which means People’s Wealth Scheme. “(RuPay Card transactions are) just a drop in the ocean at the moment. But drop by drop we are increasing our size.” NPCI is also trying to lure more customers by charging banks lower fees than Visa and MasterCard, Hota added. Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, declined to give its India market share, but said the country was amongst the world’s fastest-growing payments markets. “We believe Visa is well-positioned competitively,” Uttam Nayak, group country manager of India and South Asia, at Visa, said in emailed comments, adding his company welcomed competition. MasterCard did not reply to Reuters’ requests seeking comment. NPCI’s shareholders include India’s biggest bank, the State Bank of India, and foreign lenders Citibank and HSBC. The central bank has a nominee on its board. The organisation plans to launch RuPay cards that will be accepted overseas through a partnership with Discover Financial Services, Hota said, and is also in talks with Japanese card network JCB about a partnership. RuPay had aimed to issue credit cards by March 2015, but those plans have now been delayed by the government scheme, Hota said. “Rural acceptance of the Jan Dhan cards will be our priority,” he added.

308,MA,MasterCard decline has top-performing large-cap fund buying,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Portfolio manager Bill Nygren, whose $6.2 billion Oakmark Select fund has been among the best performing large cap funds in 2014, has added more than a million shares of MasterCard Inc this year, even as shares of the payments company have shed almost 12 percent year to date.  Now the fourth-largest position in Nygren’s fund, Mastercard has lost value on investor concerns about international sanctions on Russia and developments in alternative payments, such as Apple’s introduction of its own payments system and eBay’s decision to spin off its PayPal division into a separate company.  Nygren, whose 10.3 percent gain for the year puts his fund in the top 1 percent of 1,586 large cap funds tracked by Morningstar, sees phone-based payments as accelerating the demise of cash. That should be especially helpful to MasterCard, the second-largest payments company globally, in emerging market countries where smartphones are more plentiful than bank accounts, he said. “If I pay with a smartphone instead of a credit card, that doesn’t mean that MasterCard is going to be missing out on its fraction of a percentage of the sale.” While he owns shares of Visa Inc in another fund he managers, Nygren has been buying MasterCard for the Oakmark Select fund, because it has more to gain from growth overseas and should perform better over the next three to five years, he said. Visa, by comparison, is more U.S.-focused, he said. Visa gets more than 50 percent of its revenue domestically, compared with 40 percent for MasterCard, according to Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. The drop in MasterCard shares, which trails the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 by about 17 percentage points year to date, makes the company a bargain even though it trades at 26.5  times trailing earnings, Nygren said. He expects the company to increase earnings by approximately 20 percent a year for the next several years as it continues to grow overseas, compared with single digit growth for the S&P; 500. Visa, by comparison, is down 5 percent for the year and trades at a cheaper 23 times trailing earnings. Nygren is not put off by the fact that MasterCard is more expensive by those measures, even as it underperforms its competitors. “Buying excellent companies at average prices is just as much value investing as buying average companies at exceptional prices,” Nygren said.  Analysts are largely bullish on the company, with an average target price among analysts tracked by Reuters of $89.02, a figure 22 percent higher than its closing price of $73.42 on Thursday. Twenty-eight out of 35 analysts tracked by Reuters have an overweight or buy rating, with just one, Christopher Donat at Sandler O’Neill Partners, having a sell rating. Concerns that the company’s growth will slow after years of strong performance is one of the main reasons behind its falling stock price this year, said Wedbush’s Luria, who has a “hold” rating on the shares and a target price of $80. He recently reduced his 2014 earnings per share estimate for the company to $3.04 from $3.14. “The upside is less than it used to be,” he said, adding that Chase bank’s decision early this year to shift customers from MasterCard-branded debit and credit cards to Visa cards will continue to cut into growth. Mastercard did not comment for this story. Nygren is not put off by MasterCard’s continued declines since he began buying. Shares are down 2.2 percent over the last week alone. “MasterCard has not helped our performance this year, but there is nothing fundamentally going on at the company that we are concerned about,” he said.

314,MA,Apple CEO fires back as retailers block Pay,"LAGUNA BEACH, Calif., Oct 27 (Reuters) - Apple Inc  CEO Tim Cook fired back at CVS and Rite Aid on Monday after the drugstore chains blocked the iPhone maker’s mobile payments service, saying there were plenty of other retailers around the world to sign up. Apple Pay launched about a week ago and saw more than a million credit cards registered over the first 72 hours. It already totes up more transactions than all other “contactless” payment methods combined, Cook said, citing Visa and Mastercard data. Such services, through which a user pays by holding a smartphone close to a specially designed terminal, have failed to catch on in the United States despite the backing of Google Inc and other influential players. News emerged over the weekend that the two retailers had opted out of Apple Pay in favor of a rival system that roughly 50 chains, including Wal-Mart and Best Buy, are developing for in-house use. “We’ve got a lot more merchants to sign up, we’ve got a lot of banks to sign up and we’ve got the rest of the world,” Cook told the Wall Street Journal Digital Live conference, in the company’s most extensive comments on the blockade so far. In launching Apple Pay, the iPhone maker hopes to lock in more customers for its mobile devices by enhancing their overall utility. Industry experts say it stands a chance of becoming the first widely used payments feature on smartphones. CVS and Rite Aid have not explained their surprise move.     But the driving force behind developing a retailer-owned mobile payment solution is to avoid paying credit card transaction fees to card companies like Visa and Mastercard, analysts said. Fees range between 2 percent and 3 percent of costs per transaction. Rite Aid stopped accepting Apple Pay last week at its 4,572 stores. Spokeswoman Ashley Flower said the company was evaluating various forms of mobile payment technologies. CVS did not respond to queries seeking comment but a visit to two of its stores showed that the NFC (Near Field Communications) reader on which Apple Pay was used had been deactivated. It remains to be seen, despite early signs of success, whether mobile payments will become widely adopted. Cook argued on Monday that Apple Pay offered better security and privacy than competing services, and that retailers risked alienating customers by limiting choices at checkout. “It’s a skirmish,” Cook said in response to a question about the retailers’ moves. “Merchants have different objectives sometimes. But in the long arc of time, you only are relevant as a retailer or merchant if your customers love you.”        (Writing by Edwin Chan; Editing by Stephen Coates)",10282014,http://www.reuters.com/article/apple-payments/apple-ceo-fires-back-as-retailers-block-pay-idUSL1N0SN08920141028
315,MA,RPT-UPDATE 2-China to free clearing market for bank cards,"(Repeats to additional subscribers) * China to free up market for clearing bank card transactions * Move could benefit foreign firms such as Visa, Mastercard BEIJING, Oct 29 (Reuters) - China will open up its market for clearing domestic bank card transactions, the cabinet said on Wednesday, in a move that could benefit companies such as Visa Inc and Mastercard, in a booming market worth over $1 trillion a year. Access for foreign firms to China’s fast-growing electronic payments market is a controversial issue. China promised to reform and free its electronic payments market after the World Trade Organisation (WTO) said in 2012 that its behaviour discriminated against U.S. firms. Wednesday’s announcement by the State Council followed a weekly meeting. Foreign firms that meet its criteria could set up their own clearing companies, it added, but gave no further details. It was not immediately clear if the move would allow foreign firms to process credit and debit card payments made in yuan in China. Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, welcomed the move. “We look forward to seeing the specific details and working with people within China to figure out what we need to do to participate in that marketplace, where we believe we can add a lot of value,” Chief Executive Charlie Scharf said on a conference call, following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings. In July 2012, the world trade body held that China had discriminated against U.S. bank card suppliers in its electronic payments market by favouring state behemoth China UnionPay, following a complaint to the WTO by the United States. The trade watchdog found that UnionPay had an illegal monopoly on yuan payment cards issued and used in China, but rejected the U.S. claim that UnionPay was an “across-the-board monopoly supplier” of all yuan transactions. As the world’s largest card brand with 3.53 billion cards in circulation since its founding in 2002, UnionPay’s rise came at a time of explosive growth in China’s interbank card market. Total bank card transactions leapt 37 percent to 21.8 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) in China in 2012, from 2011. China requires all foreign card companies to piggyback on UnionPay’s network when accepting yuan payments. This means firms such as Visa and Mastercard must give a cut of every credit or debit card transaction to UnionPay and the card issuing bank. In most other countries, the foreign card issuers pay only the bank because they use their own network. Wednesday’s promise to free a business sector is the latest step taken by China this year to free up the world’s second-largest economy, albeit in vague terms. The Chinese cabinet last month also said it was freeing up the domestic courier market, potentially opening the way to competition by firms such as FedEx Corp and United Parcel Services. But that announcement, like Wednesday’s, also gave no details, and it was unclear which curbs would be eased.

In July 2012, the world trade body held that China had discriminated against U.S. bank card suppliers in its electronic payments market by favouring state behemoth China UnionPay, following a complaint to the WTO by the United States. The trade watchdog found that UnionPay had an illegal monopoly on yuan payment cards issued and used in China, but rejected the U.S. claim that UnionPay was an “across-the-board monopoly supplier” of all yuan transactions. As the world’s largest card brand with 3.53 billion cards in circulation since its founding in 2002, UnionPay’s rise came at a time of explosive growth in China’s interbank card market. Total bank card transactions leapt 37 percent to 21.8 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) in China in 2012, from 2011. China requires all foreign card companies to piggyback on UnionPay’s network when accepting yuan payments. This means firms such as Visa and Mastercard must give a cut of every credit or debit card transaction to UnionPay and the card issuing bank. In most other countries, the foreign card issuers pay only the bank because they use their own network. Wednesday’s promise to free a business sector is the latest step taken by China this year to free up the world’s second-largest economy, albeit in vague terms. The Chinese cabinet last month also said it was freeing up the domestic courier market, potentially opening the way to competition by firms such as FedEx Corp and United Parcel Services. But that announcement, like Wednesday’s, also gave no details, and it was unclear which curbs would be eased.

318,MA,MasterCard profit beats driven by international business,"(Reuters) - MasterCard Inc (MA.N) reported a better-than-expected 15.5 percent jump in quarterly profit as efforts to expand its international business pay off, with more people willing to use cards instead of cash. China’s decision to open up its $1 trillion a year domestic bank card market to foreign companies should further benefit the company and its larger rival Visa Inc (V.N).  “We are pleased with the announcement and see it as a good step in the right direction,” MasterCard Chief Executive Ajay Banga said on a post-earnings conference call. MasterCard's shares were up 7 percent at $81.25 in midday trading. Visa was up 8.7 percent, the biggest gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI on Thursday. MasterCard has a bigger exposure to global markets than Visa, deriving nearly 60 percent of its revenue from its international business. Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said if the two companies were to grow at their current rate, they would need big new opportunities and China was one of them. MasterCard’s worldwide purchase volume, excluding the United States, grew 12.8 percent to $554 billion on local currency basis in the third quarter. The company’s cross-border volume fees rose 14 percent to $835 million. The two companies also benefited from a rise in global consumer confidence. A Nielsen survey showed that concerns about the economy and job prospects had eased globally in the three months ended September from the second quarter.  U.S. consumer confidence rose in August to its highest level since October 2007.  Visa, which reported a better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit on Wednesday, said cross-border transactions increased 10 percent. MasterCard’s net income rose to $1.02 billion, or 87 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $879 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose 12.8 percent to $2.5 billion.  Analysts on average had expected earnings of 78 cents per share on revenue of $2.45 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MasterCard and Visa are also turning their attention to mobile payments and have partnered with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in the launch of Apple Pay, which allows iPhone users to pay using their phones. Chief Executive Ajay Banga said the company planned to use mobile-based payments as a key tool of its cash displacement efforts.

319,MA,"US STOCKS-Wall St up on GDP, earnings; fund year-end lifts winners","* Nikkei report on GPIF allocation changes gives stocks support * Visa, MasterCard rally after results * Third-quarter GDP tops expectations * Indexes up: Dow 1.3 pct, S&P; 500 0.6 pct, Nasdaq 0.4 pct By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday, boosted by a strong reading on quarterly economic growth and by another round of upbeat earnings reports including Visa, which accounted for nearly 140 points in the Dow industrials. Despite the bullish data and the Federal Reserve’s Wednesday statement indicating the economy is strengthening, gains on the S&P; 500 were led by healthcare and utilities, traditionally defensive sectors. Analysts cited mutual funds purchases of the best performing stocks for the run in those sectors, as funds close their books for the year at the end of this month. Healthcare and utilities are both up nearly 20 percent year-to-date. “End of year for mutual funds is most likely going to be selling losers and continue to buy winners,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. Healthcare also got a boost by Bristol-Myers Squibb, up 8.9 percent to $58.98 after results from an experimental clinical trial on a lung cancer drug were encouraging. Gross domestic product grew at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter, beating expectations. A separate report showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits rose marginally last week, but a measure of underlying trends hit its lowest level since May 2000 in a show of labor market strength. Adding to support from earnings and economic data, market participants cited a report from the Nikkei newspaper that confirmed expectations that Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund, considered a bellwether for other Japanese institutional investors, will cut holdings of Japanese bonds and add to local and foreign equities. The iShares MSCI Japan ETF gained 0.8 percent and U.S. dollar denominated Nikkei futures gained 0.7 percent. “The more you hear demand for equities picking up globally, that is going to be a net positive for U.S. equities,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. “If you look globally, growth is here in the United States,” she said. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 221.11 points, or 1.3 percent, to 17,195.42, the S&P; 500 gained 12.35 points, or 0.62 percent, to 1,994.65 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 16.91 points, or 0.37 percent, to 4,566.14. Visa jumped 10.2 percent to $236.65, the biggest boost to both the Dow and S&P; 500, a day after it reported adjusted earnings that topped expectations, and said the mobile payment industry would be “a great driver” for business. MasterCard also posted a better-than-expected profit, while revenue was up almost 13 percent. Its shares added 9.4 percent to $83.13. So far this reporting season, 75.5 percent of S&P; 500 companies have exceeded profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, above the long-term average of 63 percent. The New York Stock Exchange said it had experienced an outage in publishing and receiving trades and quotes on two of its exchanges, the latest incident to hit data processors key to trading. Within 10 minutes of the initial notification, the exchange released a statement that said the issue, which affected the NYSE and NYSE MKT exchanges, had been resolved. Traders noted that a sudden, huge surge in equity futures volume occurred concurrently with the problems, but could not say whether it was related. Despite the outage, trading in NYSE-listed securities appeared to be relatively unaffected, with steady volume still seen in those issues. Overall volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.9 billion, below the daily average so far this month of 7.8 billion, according to BATS Global Markets data. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,948 to 1,116, for a 1.75-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,689 issues rose and 975 fell for a 1.73-to-1 ratio. The benchmark S&P; 500 index posted 81 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 125 new highs and 50 new lows.

While China lags behind countries such as the United States in spending on credit, habits are changing fast and the Chinese are increasingly swiping plastic to satisfy their growing appetite for consumer goods. The State Council, China’s cabinet, said on Wednesday after a weekly meeting that foreign firms that meet its criteria could set up their own clearing companies. It did not provide details. Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, welcomed the move. “We look forward to seeing the specific details and working with people within China to figure out what we need to do to participate in that marketplace, where we believe we can add a lot of value,” Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf said on a conference call, following the release of its fourth-quarter earnings. Household debt in China amounted to just 37 percent of GDP at the end of July, compared with 81 percent in the United States.  But the Chinese, renowned for being thrifty, are changing fast.  China’s total outstanding credit card balances, while less than 10 percent of household debt, were a third higher at the end of June than a year ago, according to the People’s Bank of China. The amount outstanding per card has increased by more than two-thirds in two years. Mastercard, the second-largest payments company globally, also welcomes the opportunity to expand in the world’s second-largest economy. “We will continue to monitor closely and look forward to the day when we can compete for domestic business in China,” MasterCard said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday. The explosion in online retailers, fueled by increasingly well-heeled youth, is adding to the allure of plastic.  Access for foreign firms to China’s fast-growing electronic payments market is a controversial issue.  China promised to reform and free its electronic payments market after the World Trade Organization (WTO) said in 2012 that its behavior discriminated against U.S. firms. It was not immediately clear if the move would allow foreign firms to process credit and debit card payments made in yuan in China.  In July 2012, the world trade body held that China had discriminated against U.S. bank card suppliers in its electronic payments market by favoring state behemoth China UnionPay, following a complaint to the WTO by the United States. The trade watchdog found that UnionPay had an illegal monopoly on yuan payment cards issued and used in China, but rejected the U.S. claim that UnionPay was an “across-the-board monopoly supplier.     “As a market-orientated business, China UnionPay will operate under the same regulations as other banks, to ensure equal market competition in a way that complies with the law,” said UnionPay in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday.     As the world’s largest card brand with 3.53 billion cards in circulation since its founding in 2002, UnionPay’s rise came at a time of explosive growth in China’s interbank card market.  Total bank card transactions leapt 37 percent to 21.8 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) in China in 2012, from 2011. China requires all foreign card companies to piggyback on UnionPay’s network when accepting yuan payments.  This means firms such as Visa and Mastercard must give a cut of every credit or debit card transaction to UnionPay and the card issuing bank. In most other countries, the foreign card issuers pay only the bank because they use their own network. Wednesday’s promise to free a business sector is the latest step taken by China this year to open up its financial markets.  The Chinese cabinet last month also said it was freeing up the domestic courier market, potentially opening the way to competition by firms such as FedEx Corp (FDX.N) and United Parcel Services (UPS.N).

As the world’s largest card brand with 3.53 billion cards in circulation since its founding in 2002, UnionPay’s rise came at a time of explosive growth in China’s interbank card market. Total bank card transactions leapt 37 percent to 21.8 trillion yuan ($3.6 trillion) in China in 2012, from 2011. China requires all foreign card companies to piggyback on UnionPay’s network when accepting yuan payments. This means firms such as Visa and Mastercard must give a cut of every credit or debit card transaction to UnionPay and the card issuing bank. In most other countries, the foreign card issuers pay only the bank because they use their own network. Wednesday’s promise to free a business sector is the latest step taken by China this year to open up its financial markets. The Chinese cabinet last month also said it was freeing up the domestic courier market, potentially opening the way to competition by firms such as FedEx Corp and United Parcel Services. But that announcement, like Wednesday’s, also gave no details, and it was unclear which curbs would be eased.

330,MA,"UPDATE 2-MasterCard, Visa to cut fees for Canadian merchants, govt says","(Adds opposition politician, analyst comment) TORONTO, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc  voluntarily agreed to cut the fees they charge to Canadian retailers for credit transactions, the government said on Tuesday, adding it now sees no need to regulate fees set by credit card networks. The Canadian government said the agreement, which industry sources last week confirmed was in the works, should result in lower prices for consumers. Canadian retailers have long bemoaned the high interchange fees they pay credit card companies and banks for transactions. Unlike American Express, which typically negotiates a flat fee with every merchant, Visa and MasterCard have variable fees based on the status of their different cards. Small retailers say this hurts them as they are never sure on whether they are going to be billed 1 or 3 percent on any given transaction. Canada’s Conservative government pledged earlier this year to promote lower credit card acceptance costs for merchants. And Finance Minister Joe Oliver said in September the government wanted credit card companies and banks to voluntarily agree to a deal. On Tuesday Oliver said he welcomed the decision, which will trim fees to an average effective rate of 1.5 percent for the next five years, reducing overall fees by about 10 percent. “As a result of the voluntary proposals, there is no need for the government to regulate the interchange rates,” the government said, adding that Visa and MasterCard have agreed to start implementing the reductions no later than April. The deal was panned by Canada’s main opposition party, who said the move let down consumers or small businesses and noted that Canada’s Competition Tribunal had specifically called on the government to regulate the fees. “We can’t allow companies to set their own disciplinary measures,” New Democrat parliamentarian Annick Papillon said in a statement, dubbing the government’s decision a “shameful climb-down.” Although the long anticipated fee reduction is likely to eat slightly into the bottom line of the Canadian banks, analysts expect a limited impact. “We believe potential changes to interchange fees represent a modest but transitory headwind to the group, with a greater impact to TD and CIBC, and the least impact to Scotia and Royal (Bank),” Barclays analyst John Aiken wrote in a note to clients. Aiken noted there are several ways the banks can mitigate the impact of the reduction, including by increasing annual fees on cards and reducing the benefits of loyalty programs. A spokesman for Royal Bank of Canada said the bank was still assessing the impact of the changes, but was well positioned to make any adjustments required. Shares in Aimia, operator of the Aeroplan loyalty program, had been weighed down by the prospect of a lower fee structure. But the stock rose 4.6 percent on Tuesday, suggesting investors do not see the changes crimping the popular reward program offered by certain banks on some credit cards.

332,MA,Online threat to China's UnionPay outweighs foreign card rivals,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese bank card operator UnionPay, which may soon have to defend its near monopoly against Visa and MasterCard, faces a much bigger threat from online payment providers such as Alipay, and is upgrading its systems to meet the danger. Shored up by a raft of protectionist measures, the state-backed company has grown in just over a decade from an unknown name to a true heavyweight, commanding 50.6 percent of all the global cards in circulation in 2013, according to the Nilson Report statistics newsletter. China said last month it would open its credit card market to foreign players following a World Trade Organization ruling in 2012 that it discriminated against U.S. card firms. The prize for the foreign companies would be access to what is projected to become the biggest card market in the world by 2020. Transactions were already around 32 trillion yuan ($5.22 trillion) in China in 2013, according to data from the People’s Bank of China. But analysts say the obstacles to a successful foreign invasion of UnionPay’s dominant card position are considerable, as UnionPay charges merchants much lower rates than the Western card companies - as low as 0.04 percent, compared with MasterCard’s 0.60-1.85 percent in Britain for certain cards. “The low rates in China will make entry by foreign players extremely difficult as business cases will not stack up, based on the lower rates,” said James McKeogh, a partner in consulting at KPMG China.     A more immediate and perilous threat comes from online payment firms like Alipay, a unit of giant e-commerce company Alibaba, which already dominates a parallel and growing payment universe that rivals the traditional card set-up. In less than three years, Alipay has grown to control nearly half of China’s online third-party payment market, tapping the hundreds of millions of Chinese still without a credit card. That market commanded gross merchandise volume of 17.2 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion) in 2013, according to estimates from iResearch. UnionPay, on the other hand, commands a mere 11.9 percent of that market and faces competition from over 250 new online providers that have been awarded licenses from Beijing as it aims to stimulate consumer demand. Alibaba told Bloomberg on Wednesday it was open to working with eBay Inc’s PayPal to expand its payment options, a plan that could magnify Alipay’s reach and put further pressure on UnionPay.  With the opening of the market, Li Ye, an analyst at Analysys International, believes that with government support, Alipay could even challenge UnionPay’s offline payment dominance. “Alipay is well placed to become the next UnionPay,” said Li. UnionPay is nevertheless putting up a fight. Last month it started working with airlines Lufthansa, Emirates [EMIRA.UL], Etihad and Air Holland to provide payment services for online airline tickets through its cards for the first time.     In September, it teamed up with Samsung in near-field-communication payment (NFC), which lets users pay by tapping their phones on a device available at local shops. UnionPay’s company spokesman said it plans to “deepen its transformation into a market-orientated firm. And embrace market competition.” But Alipay is also trying to clinch a deal with Apple on its own NFC payment system, a senior executive from Alibaba told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. Alipay also has the advantage of being at the heart of the freewheeling, profitable and fast-growing Alibaba empire, which just eight weeks ago pulled off the world’s biggest-ever IPO in New York.

334,MA,"WRAPUP 2-Kiev, rebels exchange POWs; trains, buses to Crimea suspended","(Adds presidential spokesman comments, paragraph 7; updates prisoner totals, paragraph 2) * Bus, train suspension creates Crimea transport blockade * Prisoner swap follows talks on Wednesday * Visa, Mastercard stop supporting bank cards in Crimea By Pavel Polityuk and Alessandra  Prentice KIEV, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Ukraine’s government and pro-Russian separatists on Friday exchanged hundreds of prisoners of war while Kiev said it would suspend all train and bus service to Crimea, effectively creating a transportation blockade to and from the region. The agreement to swap 150 Ukrainian servicemen for 222 rebels followed peace talks between envoys of Ukraine, Russia, the separatists and European security watchdog Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on Wednesday. Ukrainian transportation chiefs said the reason for suspending train and bus service was the need to protect passengers due to a “deteriorating” security situation on the Black Sea peninsula, annexed by Russia in March. Crimea is controlled by Russia, but its only land link is with Ukraine and it has remained dependent on the Ukrainian mainland for most of its supplies, including much of its electricity and water. Ukraine already has banned sea and air traffic with Crimea, which is still serviced by Russian airlines. Other road transportation including passenger cars and trucks will still be allowed to travel into and out of Crimea. State rail company Ukrzaliznytsia said cargo trains would be suspended beginning on Friday, while passenger routes would gradually cease running over the weekend and on Monday. “The head of the SBU (security service) reported the release of 146 Ukrainians to the President. The SBU expects another four prisoners to be released tomorrow. They will all be able to celebrate New Year ... with their families,” Svyatoslav Tsegolko, a spokesman for President Petro Poroshenko, said in a Facebook post. Earlier, an SBU aide had said they would hand over 225 rebels for the Ukrainian servicemen. It is not known exactly how many prisoners are held by the two sides, but Ukraine’s military said this month about 600 Ukrainians were in rebel hands. In addition, Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, the world’s two largest credit and debit card companies, said they could no longer support bank cards being used in Crimea  following U.S. sanctions imposed earlier this month. The United States last Friday prohibited U.S.-registered companies from investing in Crimea or providing services to companies operating there, among measures imposed over Russia’s annexation of the peninsula from Ukraine. Russia’s takeover of Crimea, an annexation Kiev does not recognise, pushed relations between Moscow and the West to their lowest point since the Cold War. Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a new military doctrine, naming NATO expansion among key external risks, the Kremlin said on Friday, days after Ukraine made fresh steps to join the Atlantic military alliance. The uprising by separatists began a month after Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in March, following the popular overthrow of Ukraine’s Moscow-backed president. The conflict has killed more than 4,700 people. Kiev’s pro-Western government has said Russia orchestrated the rebellion in Ukraine’s east, a charge denied by Moscow. Violence arising from Kiev’s conflict with pro-Russian separatists has been confined almost exclusively to eastern regions of Ukraine and has not affected Crimea. But the Ukrainian government has repeatedly warned of a build-up of Russian forces on the peninsula.

347,MA,MasterCard profit beats expectations as customers spend more,"(Reuters) - MasterCard Inc (MA.N), the world’s No. 2 debit and credit card company, reported a better-than-expected profit for the holiday shopping quarter as customers dug deeper into their pockets. MasterCard and larger rival Visa Inc (V.N) have been benefiting as more people use cards instead of cash across the world. However, a stronger dollar is expected to crimp their profits this year as overseas markets account for a large chunk of their transactions. The dollar, which gained nearly 13 percent .DXY in 2014, is expected to continue to be a headwind through the year on both revenue and the bottom line, MasterCard said on a conference call on Friday. The company said it expects net revenue growth for the period between 2013 and 2015 to come in at the low-end of its previously announced target of 11-14 percent. Visa also reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday but said the stronger U.S. dollar has substantially reduced travel into the U.S. from Europe, Canada, and Latin America. Both MasterCard and Visa get about 60 percent of their payment volumes from outside the United States. MasterCard’s worldwide purchase volume increased 12.1 percent to $858 billion in local currency terms during the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, while its cross-border volumes rose 19 percent. MasterCard said in December overall U.S. retail sales rose 5.5 percent from the day after Thanksgiving through Christmas Eve as demand for women’s apparel, jewelry and casual dining offset sluggish sales of electronics. Chief Executive Ajay Banga said on the call it might take about three to four months for U.S. consumers to increase their discretionary spending as they save more due to lower gas prices. The company’s net income rose to $801 million, or 69 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31 from $623 million, or 52 cents per share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose 14 percent to $2.42 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 67 cents per share on revenue of $2.39 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

351,MA,"Hoffmann leads by three, McIlroy lurking","(Reuters) - Overnight leader Morgan Hoffmann maintained his sublime form to take a three-shot lead at the halfway mark of the Arnold Palmer Invitational on Friday as Rory McIlroy and defending champion Matt Every moved into contention. Hoffmann followed his opening 66 with a sizzling seven-under-par 65 for a 13-under-par total of 131 at Bay Hill. “It’s been fun out there. Just kind of being pretty mellow and trying to hit the middle of greens,” said Hoffmann, a former junior ice hockey player and Oklahoma State University golfer ranked 137th in the world. Every had five birdies in a row from the fourth hole on his way to a 66 that vaulted him into second place at 134, a total matched by afternoon starters Harris English (66) and Sweden’s Henrik Stenson, who birdied his last four holes for another 66. One shot further back was Ben Martin, who shot a 67 for 135. World number one McIlroy also had a streak of five birdies in his 66 that moved him to eight under par for the tournament alongside Sweden’s David Lingmerth (67), Australia’s Matt Jones (65) and South Korean Danny Lee, who fired a bogey-free 64. McIlroy, who next month would complete a career grand slam with a Masters win, started the day at the 10th and began his birdie blitz at the second hole. A bogey on his penultimate hole dropped him to 136. “I probably wasn’t quite as consistent tee to green as I was yesterday,” said McIlroy, who shot an opening 70. “But the putter is a great equalizer. “Was good to see some putts dropping, considering yesterday nothing really dropped for me,” added the Northern Irishman, who took 34 putts in the first round. Hoffmann had his own birdie binge, sinking four in a row from the third after a bogey on the first and registered a blistering five-under 31 on the front nine.

352,MA,Adrenaline junkie Hoffmann getting his kicks at Bay Hill,"(Reuters) - For a self-confessed “adrenaline junkie”, golf presents its own set of challenges that Morgan Hoffmann enjoys getting to grips with. The 25-year-old New Jersey native has a pilot’s license, like to drive fast cars and is a former ice hockey player, but this week all his focus is on winning his first PGA Tour title at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill. Hoffmann, who takes a three-shot lead into the third round after opening with a 66 and posting a 65 on Friday, said he turned down a chance to skate with NHL legend Wayne Gretzky just last week. “I was actually supposed to go to Vegas last week to go skate with Gretzky. He has a celebrity (tournament) for hockey,” said Hoffmann, who picked the flatstick over the hockey stick in high school. “That would have been fun but I feel a little bit smart and try not to get hurt.” Hoffmann, a defenseman on the ice, said ice hockey might have been a viable career path. “I loved it,” the former Oklahoma State golfer said. “If I wasn’t playing golf I’d be playing hockey for sure. I would like to think I would have gone pretty far but, I had to pick — my dad made me pick one sport in high school and it turned out to be the right choice.” Hoffmann also has a healthy appetite. He had five eggs, turkey, oatmeal, raspberry and strawberries before his morning tee time and sampled some turkey breast, sweet potatoes and green beans on the course. He was asked to explain how he is thriving in golf, a pursuit in stark contrast to the fast-paced game of hockey. “I’m an adrenaline junkie,” he said. “Golf, it’s hard to be calm out there, but it really helps me focus and it’s a challenge for me. “Off the course I like doing a lot of fast action kind of sports and I get my fix off the course. “During golf it’s the hardest game I think to play and I love a challenge so it’s fun for me.” ",3212015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-hoffmann/adrenaline-junkie-hoffmann-getting-his-kicks-at-bay-hill-idUSKBN0MH02820150321

354,MA,"Visa to miss deadline for new Russia payment system, Mastercard on time: payment system head","MOSCOW, March 27 (Reuters) - Visa still needs one or two months to transfer processing of transactions made on its credit cards in Russia to a local payment system, but Mastercard will make an obligatory April 1 deadline, the head of the payment system said. Russian authorities ordered foreign card companies to move processing of their transactions in Russia to a newly created local payment system by April 1 or put down a hefty security deposit. The new rules were introduced after Visa and Mastercard stopped providing services for some Russian banks that were sanctioned over Moscow’s role in the Ukraine crisis. “With Mastercard the project is completed, all the banks are signed up. With Visa there is a fully fledged project, which has been agreed. Signing up and certifying the banks is under way,” Vladimir Komlev told journalists in comments agreed for publication on Friday. “There is an understanding of the time frame (for Visa) to complete the project, around one to two months.” Foreign card companies whose local transactions aren’t processed in Russia must from April 1 deposit collateral related to the average daily turnover on their cards with the central bank to ensure Russian customers don’t suffer if they halt services in the country. Komlev declined to comment on whether Visa would have to pay the security deposit, and Visa refused comment on the issue. On Friday, Visa said its cards would continue to function normally until it completely moved processing of transactions made on its cards in Russia to the local system. Russia’s top lender Sberbank said transactions made on Mastercard cards it had issued would from Monday be processed by Russia’s National Payment Card System, which is owned by the central bank. Rostislav Yanykin, head of Sberbank’s bank cards department, said he did not know of any banks that had managed to transfer processing of Visa cards to the local payment system. “Visa is slightly more tricky than Mastercard,” he said. “They have an exchange protocol for cash machine operations that is much more difficult.” Komlev, the head of Russia’s payment system, also said he thought the system he heads would help residents of Crimea. Visa and Mastercard late last year stopped supporting bank cards used on the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine. “We see a real solution to the problem of Crimea and Sevastopol in giving the Crimean people access to the National Payment Card System,” he said. Russia’s payment system plans to start issuing its own cards towards the end of 2015.

355,MA,Target nears $20 million MasterCard data breach settlement: WSJ,"(Reuters) - Target Corp is nearing a settlement with MasterCard Inc to reimburse financial institutions about $20 million for costs incurred from the retailer’s massive data breach in 2013, the Wall Street Journal reported.  The deal, which comes after months of negotiations, could be announced as soon as this week, according to the Journal, citing people familiar with the terms of negotiations. The $20 million covers costs that banks incurred to reissue credit cards and debit cards as a result of the breach, as well as some of the fraud that resulted from the exposure of customer information, the newspaper said. In 2013, Target said at least 40 million credit cards were compromised by the breach during the holiday shopping season, and the attack might have resulted in the theft of personal information, such as email addresses and telephone numbers, from as many as 110 million people. MasterCard will distribute the reimbursed funds to the financial institutions that issue credit cards and debit cards under its brand, including Citigroup Inc, Capital One Financial Corp and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, the Journal said. The Target settlement does not include financial institutions that issue under the Visa Inc brand. Target is negotiating separately with Visa, the report said.  In March, according to court documents, Target agreed to pay $10 million in a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit related to the data breach.  “We’ve seen the same story, but we do not comment on speculation,” MasterCard said when asked about the Journal’s report. Visa were not available for comment, and a Target spokesperson said the company has not made any announcements and had no comment on the matter.

366,MA,Banks seek to block Target's deal with MasterCard over data breach,"(Reuters) - A group of small banks and credit unions suing Target Corp over its massive data breach in 2013 are moving to block the retailer’s proposed $19 million settlement with MasterCard Inc, calling it a “sweetheart deal” aimed at undercutting their own claims for losses. Lawyers for plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which seeks class-action status, filed an emergency motion late Tuesday asking a federal judge in St. Paul, Minnesota, for a preliminary injunction that would prevent the settlement announced on March 19 from going through. The lawyers want the court to throw out terms of the deal, which they contend were “surreptitiously” aimed at barring financial institutions from being part of the lawsuit.  “The agreement between Target and MasterCard is nothing more than an attempt by Target to avoid fully reimbursing financial institutions for losses they suffered due to one of the largest data breaches in U.S. history,” said a statement on Wednesday from Charles Zimmerman of Zimmerman Reed PLLP and Karl Cambronne of Chestnut Cambronne PA, co-lead plaintiffs’ attorneys in the lawsuit. “It provides paltry restitution for the substantial losses suffered,” the statement added. “This sweetheart deal for Target was negotiated without involvement of the court or the legal representatives of the impacted financial institutions.”  Lawyers for Target did not return calls seeking comment on the motion, which could prevent it from getting a release from claims in the class-action. The motion is due to be heard in federal court Monday. Target has said the amount under its settlement with MasterCard covers costs that banks incurred to reissue credit cards and debit cards to customers as a result of the data breach.

All of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors rose, with the tech index gaining 1.09 percent, propelled by Visa and MasterCard. Visa ended 4.07 percent higher at $68.01 after hitting a record high of $69.98, while MasterCard closed up 3.91 percent after China said it would open up its market to foreign firms for clearing domestic bank card transactions. McDonald’s surged 3.13 percent after it said it was working on a plan to reverse its shrinking sales. A week ago, more than 80 percent of the S&P; 500 companies to have posted their March-quarter earnings had beaten estimates. But with 121 reports now in, that number has slipped to 71.9 percent - just above the 70 percent earnings beat rate seen over the past four quarters. Many have blamed misses on revenue on a strong dollar for making their products more expensive overseas. “We’re sorting through earnings. It’s mixed, but there’s no drastic change to the general economic recovery.” said Michael Sansoterra, portfolio manager of the RidgeWorth Large Cap Growth Fund in Atlanta. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 88.68 points, or 0.49 percent, to end at 18,038.27. The S&P; 500 gained 10.67 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,107.96 and the Nasdaq Composite added 21.07 points, or 0.42 percent, to 5,035.17. The Nasdaq Composite is now just 13 points shy of its record high close, set in March 2000, that signaled the limit of the dot-com bubble. “I do think there are valuation concerns, and some tech companies are trading at extremely high multiples,” said Derek Hoyt, chief investment officer at Minneapolis-based KDV Wealth Management, adding he does not believe valuations warrant a major selloff. Beyond earnings, Wall Street remains motivated to invest in stocks due to the Federal Reserve’s low interest-rate policy, he said. Yum Brands ended 3.95 percent higher after the restaurant operator said late on Tuesday it was recovering from a meat scare in China and expected a strong year-end finish. After the bell, eBay was up 4.3 percent after it posted March-quarter earnings above estimates and said its growth was hurt by the strong dollar.

373,MA,"Somalia's Premier Bank to bring ATMs, debit cards to Mogadishu","DUBAI, April 22 (Reuters) - Somalia’s Premier Bank has struck a deal with Mastercard and will issue debit cards and install ATM machines in the capital of the war-ravaged country, the Islamic lender’s top executive said on Wednesday. The east African nation has struggled for more than two decades with civil war and containing an insurrection by Islamist militants which has meant even basic infrastructure has been beyond most of the country’s 10 million people. Yet with al Shabaab militants driven out of the capital Mogadishu and other major strongholds, business and consumer demand has grown for services which would be taken for granted in many other parts of the world, including banking. “Somalia is a very under-penetrated market with less than 3 percent of its population banked,” Mahat Mohamed Ahmed, managing director of Premier Bank, which received a licence from the central bank last year, told Reuters in Dubai. Carrying local currency in Somalia, a de facto dollarized economy, is cumbersome as $1 is worth 21,000 Somali shillings, and the only note in circulation is 1,000 shillings. For wealthier Somalis and visiting foreigners, carrying cash can be a dangerous task in cities rife with crime and awash with guns. Ahmed said in an interview that the Islamic lender, one of a handful of banks in Somalia, will soon start distributing Mastercard-administered debit and prepaid cards to customers. It plans to have 15,000 cards issued by the end of 2015 and says its ATM machines will also accept cards issued abroad. MasterCard’s spokeswoman for Africa said it had licensed Premier Bank to go live with their cards and machines. However, Somali banks may struggle to convince the local population to sign up to debit cards, which might charge for withdrawals, as most Somalis use ubiquitous cheap, or free, mobile money technology to pay for goods and services. Premier has bought five ATM machines and will install them in various locations with high security in Mogadishu, Ahmed said. With a withdrawal limit of $1,000 a day, the cards can be used online and abroad. Salaam Somali Bank installed the sole ATM in Somalia in an upmarket hotel in Mogadishu last year. However, central bank sources and hotel visitors say it does not work. Salaam did not respond to requests for comment. Creating a banking system from scratch is proving problematic for Somalia. The U.S. terms al Qaeda-aligned al Shabaab a “terrorist organisation” and this has raised concerns in international  banking about the risk of fines if money channelled through them ends up in the hands of the militants. Premier has one of Somalia’s four registered SWIFT codes but Somali lenders are struggling to build networks of correspondent banks for cross-border transactions due to fears about money-laundering and terrorist financing. “Anti-money laundering is a huge issue for dealing with international banks. They don’t want to deal with Somali banks,” Ahmed said. Somalis have traditionally dealt with informal and unregulated money transfer firms. But these money transfer firms that send much of diaspora remittances to Somalia are also struggling as correspondent banks shut their accounts, driven by the same worries about funding militant groups. Yet despite all the challenges, Ahmed believes the security improvements in Somalia have heralded huge business opportunities: “(It) has encouraged Somalis overseas to come back and invest in the country.”   (Additional reporting by Abdi Sheikh in Mogadishu and Drazen Jorgic in Nairobi; Editing by David French, Drazen Jorgic and David Clarke)",4222015,http://www.reuters.com/article/somalia-premierbank/somalias-premier-bank-to-bring-atms-debit-cards-to-mogadishu-idUSL5N0XH3AQ20150422

375,MA,MasterCard seen stealing a march on Visa as China opens doors,"April 28 (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc’s strong association with Chinese bank card behemoth UnionPay is expected to help it reap more benefits than larger rival Visa Inc  as the country opens up its $7 trillion bank card payments market to foreign players. The world’s largest debit and credit card issuers have so far been barred from operating independently in the China bank card market - projected to become the world’s biggest by 2020. But that is set to change. China’s State Council said last week foreign firms would be allowed to apply to the central bank for licenses for bank card clearing businesses from June 1. The measure is set to end a near-monopoly held by UnionPay. It will take at least a year for foreign card issuers to start operations in China, but investor expectations are high. Shares of MasterCard and Visa rose 4 percent in the three days following the announcement. “It’s pretty close ... but MasterCard has a little more leeway than Visa because of its existing relationship with China UnionPay,” Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria told Reuters. The U.S. companies currently use UnionPay’s network when accepting yuan payments and have to pay network access fees. MasterCard and UnionPay signed an agreement in 2010 to issue co-branded cards that Chinese people could use when traveling overseas. The agreement gives MasterCard a strong headstart, as the company has cornered a large chunk of the co-branded cards market in the past few years. (reut.rs/1HzMxVQ) Chief Executive Ajay Banga said last year that more than 90 percent of new co-branded card deals issued in China went to MasterCard. Barclays analyst Darrin Peller estimated that a 1 percent shift in purchase volume from UnionPay would boost MasterCard’s earnings per share by 3-6 cents, compared with 2-4 cents for Visa. “Given that MasterCard is starting off at a smaller base, incremental growth in China may be more impactful to MasterCard’s economics than Visa’s over the next few years,” Peller said. The opportunities for both MasterCard and Visa are immense. UnionPay’s transaction volumes rose the most last year, according to the Nilson Report, an industry publication. Of every $100 worth of transactions swiped, UnionPay’s cards accounted for $38, ahead of Visa’s $37 and MasterCard’s $18. Both Visa and MasterCard said they were awaiting details on how the regulations would be implemented.

376,MA,US STOCKS-Wall St falls as economic growth stalls; Fed meeting eyed,"* First-qtr GDP growth lower-than-expected * MasterCard’s strong results also boosts Visa * Lumber Liquidator slump on news of DOJ probe * Starwood Hotels hits record high * Indexes down: Dow 0.4 pct, S&P; 0.5 pct, Nasdaq 0.5 pct   (Adds details, changes comment, updates prices) By Tanya Agrawal April 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped on Wednesday after data showed that economic growth braked more sharply than expected in the first quarter, and ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s likely decision to maintain historically low interest rates. U.S. gross domestic product grew just 0.2 percent at an annual rate in the quarter as harsh weather put off shoppers and energy companies cut spending. The reading was the weakest in a year and lower than the 1.0 percent rate forecast by economists polled by Reuters. Investors will closely examine the Fed’s statement for clues on when rates are likely to be increased, as a batch of soft data could push back the timing of a hike until the end of the year. The statement is expected at 1400 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). “I think the GDP data has to be taken with a grain of salt,” said Chris Bertelsen, chief investment officer at Global Financial Private Capital in Sarasota, Florida, which oversees $4.5 billion in funds. “We saw this movie last year where the first quarter was weak but followed up with a stronger second and third quarters and you’re going to see the same pattern this year too.” In contrast to the weak GDP numbers, other data showed that contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes rose in March to their highest level since 2013. At 11:39 a.m. EDT (1539 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 76.64 points, or 0.42 percent, at 18,033.5, the S&P; 500 was down 9.49 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,105.27 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 27.47 points, or 0.54 percent, at 5,027.95. Earnings released on Wednesday painted a mixed picture. “Corporate America is very, very busy trying to create earnings that justify the current pricing of the market,” said Dave Heidel, regional investment manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, which oversees $128 billion. Heidel said the consequence of companies cutting costs to boost earnings reflects in the poor GDP numbers, which were partly due to low corporate spending. Twitter dived 5.5 percent to $39.90, a day after the company cut its full-year forecast due to weak demand for its new direct response advertising. MasterCard rose 2.6 percent to $92.63 after reporting a better-than-expected profit. The results also pushed up Visa  1.7 percent to $67.95, making it the biggest gainer among stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Lumber Liquidators slumped as much as 21 percent to a three-year low of $26.54 after the hardwood flooring retailer said the Department of Justice is seeking criminal charges related to its imports from China. Starwood Hotels rose 8.7 percent to touch a record high of $87.80 after it said it was exploring strategic and financial alternatives. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,993 to 937, for a 2.13-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,617 issues fell and 963 advanced for a 1.68-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

377,MA,Lower costs help MasterCard handily beat profit estimates,"(Reuters) - MasterCard Inc (MA.N), the world’s No. 2 debit and credit card company, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as costs fell and shoppers spent more on its cards. MasterCard’s shares rose about 3.6 percent to a record-high of $93.59 in early trading on Wednesday. Larger rival Visa Inc’s (V.N) shares also rose 1.7 percent. “We are managing well, despite a mixed economic environment and challenging currency situation,” Chief Executive Ajay Banga said in a statement. Operating expenses fell about 1 percent to $879 million in the first quarter ended March 31, helped mainly by currency hedging. The dollar .DXY, which has gained about 22 percent in the past 12 months against a basket of major currencies, has hurt U.S. multinational companies. “Continued revenue momentum, good cost control, executing on our tax strategies ... contributed to the performance,” Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said on a post-earnings conference call. The company said it expects net revenue growth rate to be in low single digits in 2015 due to a stronger dollar. MasterCard and larger rival Visa Inc (V.N) get more than 60 percent of their revenue from outside the United States, making them vulnerable to currency fluctuations. Visa is expected to report first-quarter earnings on Thursday. American Express Co (AXP.N), the world’s largest credit card issuer, said earlier this month the dollar was partly to blame for its lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. “(MasterCard) was able to overcome a drag from currency and grow volumes and earnings based on cost discipline,” Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said. MasterCard’s worldwide purchase volume increased 11.8 percent to $783 billion in local currency terms during the quarter, while cross-border volumes jumped 19 percent. The company said on the call that it would be in a position to start operations in China by the end of 2016. Last week, China said it would open up its market for clearing domestic bank card transactions to foreign firms. MasterCard’s strong association with Chinese bank card behemoth UnionPay is expected to help it reap more benefits than Visa in the Chinese market. MasterCard’s net revenue rose 2.7 percent to $2.23 billion. Net income rose 17.2 percent to $1.02 billion, or 89 cents per share. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 91 cents a share, including a 2-cent acquisition charge. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 80 cents per share on revenue of $2.28 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

381,MA,"MasterCard doubles card numbers in Middle East, Africa"," (This story has been refiled to correct figure to 2.2 billion from 1.4 billion in second paragraph) By Tom Arnold DUBAI (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc (MA.N) has doubled the number of its cards to about 100 million in the Middle East and Africa in the past three years, where it has begun setting up partnerships with governments to provide access to its payments system. That is still a small share of MasterCard’s around 2.2 billion cards in use globally. But there is plenty of room for growth in a region where about 90 percent of transactions are still done in cash, compared with an average of 85 percent globally. “This is the fastest growing region,” Michael Miebach, president, Middle East and Africa for MasterCard worldwide, told Reuters. “We continue to expect growth above the global average.” In March, the world’s second biggest debit and credit card company signed an agreement with the Egyptian government to issue digital identification cards with built-in payment devices to 54 million Egyptians, enabling them to pay for government fees, mobile phone bills, shop purchases and other goods and services. The scheme links consumers’ identification cards with an existing payment platform on mobile phones.  MasterCard has a pilot of a similar plan with the government of Nigeria, which also has a low rate of “financial inclusion.” “We see in the Middle East as well as Africa a fairly high cash dominance. If you go to Nigeria it is about 94 percent cash.” MasterCard and larger rival Visa Inc (V.N) get more than 60 percent of revenues from outside the United States. Less than a third of MasterCard’s come from Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa. PayPal, the payments arm of eBay (EBAY.O), is also active in the region. MasterCard’s first-quarter results, published last month, showed that purchase volumes in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa rose by 15.2 percent, faster than the 11.8 percent figure for worldwide volumes.  The size of transactions in the region increased by 20.9 percent, versus a 15 percent rise globally. Within the Middle East and Africa, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were among the fastest growing markets,  Miebach said. In the UAE, robust spending by Chinese helped to offset weakness in transactions volumes by Europeans and Russians as a result of softness in the euro and rouble against the U.S. dollar, he said. Across the Middle East and Africa, business had been faster in debit cards than credit cards, with expansion also driven by popularity of prepaid cards, he said. Last month, MasterCard did a deal with Premier Bank in Somalia to issue debit cards and install ATM machines in the country.  Miebach also said growth was strong in Sub-Saharan Africa, supported by buoyant economies and people switching from cash to cards.

383,MA,Target-MasterCard settlement moves ahead despite judge's doubts,"(Reuters) - A federal judge has rejected a bid from a group of banks and credit unions suing Target Corp over its 2013 data breach to block the company’s proposed $19 million settlement with MasterCard Inc. U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson in St. Paul, Minnesota,  wrote in a ruling Thursday that the deal does not appear “altogether fair or reasonable” but he could not legally intervene without evidence that Target or MasterCard had made misleading or coercive statements. “Although the settlement may not pass the ‘smell test,’ as the saying goes, it is not serious misconduct,” Magnuson said. The settlement is contingent on banks that issued at least 90 percent of the MasterCard accounts signing on to the agreement. Lawyers for the plaintiffs had argued that the settlement with MasterCard, which is not a party to the lawsuit, was a “sweetheart deal” aimed at undercutting their claims for losses. Under the proposed agreement, announced in March, MasterCard-issuing banks have until May 20 to accept a percentage of the money from MasterCard. If they accept the deal, they must drop further claims against Target as part of the settlement. Banks that reject the deal would continue to pursue their own allegations against Target. Lawyers for the banks have estimated the total losses at more than $160 million, with approximately half for fraud and half for the cost of reissuing nearly nine million credit cards. In a statement, the lead plaintiffs’ lawyers highlighted the judge’s concerns and said they would urge banks to reject the deal. A Target spokeswoman, Molly Snyder, said, “We are pleased with the court’s decision which we believe will allow us to resolve claims with participating MasterCard issuers and avoid protracted litigation with those issuers.” The judge’s ruling said that MasterCard initially demanded $26 million before the two sides settled on $19 million. In 2013, Target said the breach during the holiday shopping season compromised at least 40 million credit cards and may have resulted in the theft of personal information from as many as 110 million people.

The settlement was contingent on banks that issued at least 90 percent of the MasterCard accounts signing on to the agreement by May 20. Any bank that accepted the settlement was required to drop further claims against Target. In an email on Friday, a MasterCard spokesman said the threshold had not been met. Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder confirmed the development and said the company had “nothing further to share at this time.” The development means that the banks will continue to press their claims against Target in the lawsuit. In a statement, the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs said, “We are pleased that financial institutions have resoundingly rejected Target and MasterCard’s attempt to avoid fully reimbursing the losses suffered during one of the largest data breaches in U.S. history.” Lawyers for the banks have estimated the total losses at more than $160 million, with approximately half that amount lost to fraud and half to the cost of reissuing nearly 9 million credit cards. In 2013, Target said the breach during the holiday shopping season compromised at least 40 million credit cards and may have resulted in the theft of personal information from as many as 110 million people. Target is still negotiating with Visa Inc  over losses from the breach.

390,MA,American Express loses emergency bid to block U.S. card injunction,"NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected American Express Co’s emergency request to halt an injunction that requires the company to let merchants steer customers toward lower-cost cards offered by competitors. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York nonetheless said it will hear American Express’ appeal in the underlying antitrust case on an expedited basis. American Express is appealing a Feb. 19 decision by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, New York that its rules preventing merchants who accept its cards from recommending that customers pay with other cards, such as MasterCard and Visa, violate antitrust laws. The judge’s April 30 injunction against enforcing these rules also lets merchants offer discounts, rebates and other incentives to customers for using other cards with lower fees. Garaufis has said American Express’ practices wrongfully exploited the New York-based company’s 26.4 percent share of purchase volume in the U.S. credit and charge card market. “We are disappointed the request for a stay was denied,” American Express said in a statement on Tuesday. “We will move forward to modify the non-discrimination provisions in our merchant contracts, per the trial court’s remedy.” American Express has argued that enforcing the injunction would “weaken competition and harm consumers” in the $2.4 trillion U.S. credit card industry, and cause irreparable harm by costing it revenue and market share. It has said the February decision, if upheld, would help entrench Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, which together have more than 1.1 billion cards in the United States versus American Express’ roughly 55 million. American Express said its card holders spend three to four times more, on average. Garaufis ruled in a lawsuit filed in 2010 by the U.S. government and 17 states. Visa and MasterCard were also sued by various governments over their anti-steering rules for merchants but settled in 2011 by agreeing to make changes. Card companies charge merchants more than $50 billion a year to process consumer transactions, the U.S. government has said. The case is U.S. et al v.

399,MA,UPDATE 2-EU antitrust regulator accuses MasterCard of excessive fees,"(Recasts, adds EuroCommerce comments) By Foo Yun Chee and Julia Fioretti BRUSSELS, July 9 (Reuters) - EU regulators accused MasterCard Inc on Thursday of levying excessive fees when cards issued outside the European Union are used within the bloc, saying they raise the price of goods and services for all. The European Commission antitrust watchdog launched the new case after a two year investigation into the world’s No. 2 card and debit card issuer and is part of efforts to trim such fees and boost cross-border trade. The EU antitrust regulator said on Thursday that the high level of interchange fees charged on cards issued outside the EU - the fees store owners pay banks to process credit card payments - were “unjustified”. When a Spanish credit card is used in a Brussels store, for example, the bank used by the Belgian shop owner has to pay the bank in Spain a percentage of the transaction. The EU watchdog says that in the case of a Chinese card being used in a Brussels store, the bank used by the shop owner could have to pay fees up to five times higher. “As these inter-regional fees represent hundreds of millions of euros each year, the Commission is concerned that these high inter-regional fees increase prices for retailers and may in turn lead to higher prices for products and services for all consumers, and not only those using cards issued outside the EU or paying with cards,” it said. The Commission said on Thursday that it had sent a charge sheet known as a statement of objections to the company. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have waged lengthy battles against such interchange charges. The EU has already taken MasterCard to task over its cross-border interchange fees within Europe. MasterCard capped those fees in 2009 after the EU competition enforcer said the high level of charges breached antitrust rules. Brussels also said on Thursday in its statement of objection that MasterCard’s rules prevented banks in one EU country from offering lower interchange fees to a retailer in a second EU country where interchange fees may be higher. “We have concerns both in relation to the rules MasterCard applies to cross-border transactions within the EU, as well as the fees charged to retailers for receiving payments made with cards issued outside Europe,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. MasterCard said: “We will be formally responding to the statement of objections and are also working with the European Commission on the issue as part of an ongoing constructive dialogue.” EuroCommerce, whose members include retailers Carrefour , Marks & Spencer, Lidl and Ikea, welcomed the Commission’s action. “This is a logical consequence of the first MasterCard case, this is just unfinished business,” Director-General Christian Verschueren said. “We believe fees should be capped in the same way as the legislation or even lower. Debit card fees should be lower. The gains will be passed onto consumers via lower prices.” EuroCommerce’s 1997 complaint triggered the first EU investigation into MasterCard. The Commission is also probing Visa International’s inter-regional card fees. The EU agreed last year to cap fees at 0.2 percent of the value of a purchase paid with debit cards and to 0.3 percent for credit cards, which will come into effect on Dec. 9.

For MasterCard, Europe made up for about 26 percent of total purchase volume in the first quarter. Visa has call options to buy Visa Europe shares, while the European company’s members have put options to sell their shares to Visa. A stronger dollar also makes the deal more attractive for Visa.

404,MA,"Merchants seek to void $6 billion Visa, MasterCard, AmEx settlements","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dozens of retailers are seeking to void nearly $6 billion of U.S. antitrust settlements with Visa Inc (V.N), MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and American Express Co (AXP.N) after learning that opposing lawyers exchanged confidential information, potentially tainting the accords. A group of retailers filed papers that remain under seal in the Brooklyn, New York federal court to scuttle their $5.7 billion accord with Visa and MasterCard, which won court approval in 2013, the retailers’ lawyer Owen Glist said in an email. Similar papers were made public in the American Express case on Wednesday in the same court, where retailers opposing the $79 million accord include Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and Home Depot Inc (HD.N) among others. Retailers claimed that the settlements were rigged in light of the discovery of an exchange of emails and other documents between Gary Friedman, a lawyer who represented them, and Keila Ravelo, a lawyer who represented MasterCard while she was a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher. Friedman and Ravelo had previously been associates at another law firm and become close friends. Their alleged improper communications were discovered by Willkie after Ravelo and her husband were criminally charged in December with stealing from that firm, another law firm and MasterCard. Roy Simon, a Hofstra University legal ethics professor, in a court filing supporting the objecting retailers, said Friedman crossed a line by passing important information to Ravelo, whose firm should in turn have been disqualified. “In my three decades studying professional responsibility for lawyers,” Simon wrote, “I cannot recall ever seeing such repeated and serious violations of professional duties by an attorney representing a class, or such willing participation in those violations by an attorney for a defendant in a class action.” The settlements were meant to resolve claims that the card networks overcharged merchants on interchange fees, or swipe fees, whenever shoppers paid with debit or credit cards. In a Wednesday conference call discussing second-quarter results, MasterCard Chief Executive Ajay Banga called the lawyers’ alleged conduct “pretty disappointing,” but said he was “pretty confident” that the company’s settlement will stand. MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen declined to elaborate. Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim declined to comment. American Express spokeswoman Marina Norville had no immediate comment. Friedman, in a Wednesday filing in the American Express case, said none of the challenged communications “detracts from the conclusion that this settlement represents the best feasible settlement for the merchant class, and is fair and adequate by any measure.” The cases are In re: Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 05-md-01720; and In re: American Express Anti-Steering Rules Litigation Antitrust Litigation in the same court, No. 11-md-02221.

406,MA,MasterCard's revenue misses estimates on higher incentives,"(Reuters) - MasterCard Inc (MA.N), the operator of the world’s second largest payment network, reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as the company offered more rebates and incentives to win new and renewed deals.   Shares of MasterCard, which operates the world’s second largest payment network, fell about 3 percent in premarket trading on Wednesday.  The company paid $940 million in rebates and incentives in the second quarter, up 21 percent from a year earlier.  MasterCard charges companies using its payment network for transactions on cards that carry its brands. It doesn’t issue cards, extend credit or set interest rates. The company usually pays higher incentives to its partners than larger rival Visa Inc (V.N).  Client incentives accounted for nearly 28 percent of MasterCard’s gross revenue in the second quarter, way above Visa’s 16 percent. MasterCard’s cross-border volumes - the value of transactions made by card holders outside the card-issuer’s country - jumped by 17 percent. The company’s net income fell to $921 million in the quarter ended June 30 from $931 million, a year earlier, due to a $44 million after-tax charge related to a U.K. merchant litigation settlement. However, earnings rose on a per-share basis to 81 cents from 80 cents.  Excluding the charge, MasterCard earned 85 cents per share. Net revenue rose 0.9 percent to $2.39 billion.

407,MA,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-MasterCard's revenue misses estimates on higher incentives,"(Changes company description to “operator of the world’s second largest payment network” from “credit and debit card issuer” in paragraph 1) July 29 (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc, the operator of the world’s second largest payment network, reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as the company offered more rebates and incentives to win new and renewed deals. Shares of MasterCard, which operates the world’s second largest payment network, fell about 3 percent in premarket trading on Wednesday. The company paid $940 million in rebates and incentives in the second quarter, up 21 percent from a year earlier. MasterCard charges companies using its payment network for transactions on cards that carry its brands. It doesn’t issue cards, extend credit or set interest rates. The company usually pays higher incentives to its partners than larger rival Visa Inc. Client incentives accounted for nearly 28 percent of MasterCard’s gross revenue in the second quarter, way above Visa’s 16 percent. MasterCard’s cross-border volumes - the value of transactions made by card holders outside the card-issuer’s country - jumped by 17 percent. The company’s net income fell to $921 million in the quarter ended June 30 from $931 million, a year earlier, due to a $44 million after-tax charge related to a U.K. merchant litigation settlement. However, earnings rose on a per-share basis to 81 cents from 80 cents. Excluding the charge, MasterCard earned 85 cents per share. Net revenue rose 0.9 percent to $2.39 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 85 cents per share and revenue of $2.41 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MasterCard’s shares were trading at $92.50 before the bell.

409,MA,"ATM fee lawsuits against Visa, Mastercard, banks revived on appeal","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court has revived litigation against Visa Inc (V.N), Mastercard Inc (MA.N) and several U.S. banks accusing them of conspiring to inflate the prices of ATM access fees in violation of antitrust law. In a decision on Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said a district court erred when it concluded that consumers had no standing to sue and had not adequately alleged antitrust violations. It remanded the three consolidated lawsuits to the district court for further proceedings. The decision revives two class actions brought by consumers and another one brought by independent ATM operators. Their lawsuits accused Visa and MasterCard of adopting rules protecting themselves from competition with lower-cost ATM network. The rules blocked ATM operators from charging less when ATM transactions were processed by networks competing with Visa and Mastercard, the lawsuits said. The rules also benefited major banks, which were equity shareholders of Visa and Mastercard, the lawsuits said.      The lawsuits seek damages for consumers and ATM operators for violations of antitrust law.  The ruling sends the litigation back to the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, where the complaints were dismissed in 2013. Steve Berman, a lawyer for the consumers, said he plans to seek permission to amend the complaints.  “This is a big win for consumers, who now can seek not only damages caused by the defendants but can now also pursue an injunction that will spark competition in the ATM market,” Berman said.  Matthew Eisenstein, a lawyer for Visa, declined comment. Lawyers for Mastercard could not immediately be reached for comment. Also named as defendants in the lawsuits were Bank of America (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC.N). The lawsuit said that the banks controlled Visa and MasterCard and set higher ATM charges before the credit card companies went public in 2008 and 2006, respectively. Lawyers for the banks could not immediately be reached for comment. In Tuesday’s ruling, the appeals panel said “it can be inferred” that banks continue to benefit from the challenged conduct because they still own shares in Visa and Mastercard.

411,MA,U.S. judge rejects American Express class action settlement,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected a proposed class action settlement between American Express Co (AXP.N) and merchants who sued the company over swipe fees, ruling that a lawyer for the merchants compromised the fairness of the agreement. U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, New York, ruled that lawyer Gary Friedman acted improperly by talking about the case and sharing confidential information with a friend who represented MasterCard Inc (MA.N) in a parallel class action against MasterCard and Visa Inc (V.N). Garaufis wrote that Friedman repeatedly violated court rules meant to protect confidential information and created a conflict of interest.  The violations were so blatant that in at least two emails, Friedman wrote to his friend, “burn after reading.” Garaufis ordered Friedman removed as co-lead counsel for the merchants and ordered a new round of written briefs to be filed in the case by Sept. 8. Two lawyers who represent Friedman could not immediately be reached for comment. The proposed antitrust settlement would have allowed merchants to impose a surcharge on American Express users, potentially treating those cardholders differently from other customers. Such settlements generally require court approval. Merchants were not due to receive any money from the agreement, although Friedman and two other law firms that served as co-lead counsel were due to receive $75 million in fees. American Express said in a statement it was disappointed in the ruling because it considered the settlement agreement fair. It added: “We believe we have strong defenses against the merchants’ claims, and will continue to fight our case in court.”  The case is In Re: American Express Anti-Steering Rules Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, No. 1:11-md-2221.

412,MA,COLUMN-Judge finds lawyer 'fatally tainted' Amex deal: Frankel,"(The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.) (Reuters) - Gary Friedman of the Friedman Law Group can now put a price tag on the cost of his horribly misguided decision to share privileged and confidential documents from his antitrust class action against American Express with his old friend Keila Ravelo, a lawyer for MasterCard in a parallel case: $75 million. After a ruling Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis of Brooklyn, Friedman and his co-counsel in the Amex case are no longer in line for that $75 million. They were slated to receive the money for a settlement that permits merchants to impose a surcharge on customers who use Amex credit cards, as long as those retailers impose the same surcharge when consumers use other credit cards. The judge denied final approval of the settlement, finding that Friedman didn’t provide class members with adequate representation. Garaufis’ ruling adds devastating details to previously bare-bones allegations about the documents Friedman gave Ravelo. The misconduct first surfaced after federal prosecutors charged Ravelo with setting up a fake legal services company that she and her husband allegedly used to defraud MasterCard and two law firms where she had been a partner, Willkie Farr & Gallagher and Hunton & Williams. Willkie’s internal investigation of Ravelo turned up evidence that Friedman had been sending documents from the Amex case to her, even as she defended MasterCard in a separate class action raising similar swipe-fee antitrust allegations against Visa and MasterCard. Merchants that didn’t like the terms of the Amex settlement or the $5.7 billion settlement in the MasterCard case have argued that Friedman’s disclosures tainted both deals, even though MasterCard was not a defendant in the Amex case Friedman led and Friedman wasn’t lead counsel for the class suing Visa and MasterCard. Their briefs have been heavily redacted. Judge Garaufis’ opinion is not. His decision shows that Friedman gave Ravelo pretty much his entire case file: confidential Amex documents (at least 33), confidential documents from members of the class he was representing (22 of those), even his own work product, including strategy memos and emails amongst his co-counsel. Friedman’s lawyers, New York University law professor Samuel Issacharoff and Theresa Trzaskoma of Brune & Richard, have said he used Ravelo as an informal sounding board, to the benefit of the class. Judge Garaufis said instead that his disclosures to a lawyer for MasterCard called his loyalty to his clients into question. “Whether Friedman exchanged confidential and/or privileged materials with Ravelo and consulted with her regarding these actions for financial reasons, out of personal loyalty, due to a misplaced sense that her advice would in fact benefit the merchant class and was not improper, and/or for some other reason(s), is something this court cannot currently, and need not, determine,” he wrote. “Whatever his reason for doing so, Friedman’s bringing MasterCard’s counsel into the negotiating process created a conflict between class members and class counsel, and specifically a risk that Friedman, with Ravelo in his ear, negotiated settlement terms that are worse for class members than the terms he might have negotiated absent that conflict.” The judge said Friedman’s co-counsel, Reinhardt Wendorf & Blanchfield and Read McCaffrey, showed their own questionable judgment by sticking with Friedman in a brief attempting to rescue the settlement, rather than acknowledging his wrongdoing. “This gives the appearance that Friedman’s co-counsel may be more interested in protecting Friedman, their settlement, and their attorneys’ fees application, than they are in protecting the merchant class that they purport to represent,” the judge said. He removed Friedman as class counsel and ordered the other lead lawyers to submit briefs on why he shouldn’t bounce them as well. Garaufis’ opinion is full of surprising revelations, like Friedman and Ravelo’s plan to jointly represent merchants in arbitrations against American Express or to buy a Gulfstream jet and start an air charter business. Friedman, according to the judge, knew full well that it was wrong of him to share documents from the Amex case with Ravelo. He sent some sensitive messages to Ravelo’s personal email account, rather than her work addresses, “suggesting an intention to keep the communications from being discovered,” Judge Garaufis wrote. And in at least two emails to Ravelo, the judge said, Friedman wrote, “Burn after reading.” Breaching attorney client privilege might have been enough of an offense to justify a finding that Friedman did not adequately represent the merchants in the class, the judge said, “but this is not where the misconduct ends, and it does not constitute the complete story of the inadequacy of representation in this case.” That is where Judge Garaufis’ opinion gets really interesting. He discusses the intersection of the now-rejected Amex settlement with merchants’ $5.7 billion settlement with MasterCard and Visa, suggesting a motive for Friedman to push for a certain provision in the MasterCard deal. Retailers with objections to the MasterCard settlement have struggled to convince the magistrate judge in their case that Friedman’s improper disclosures should upend the final judgment entered against MasterCard and Visa. Garaufis’ opinion should help them hone their theory. According to the judge, the two settlements were inextricably connected, and Friedman - who assisted class counsel in the MasterCard case in negotiations on injunctive relief - had an incentive to argue for a provision in that settlement that would help him reach a deal with Amex. The judge quoted an email from November 2011 in which Friedman told Ravelo that Amex’s “fantasy resolution” of the swipe fee litigation was surcharge parity, in which merchants can tack on fees for Amex users as long as they charge the same fees when customers use Visa and MasterCard credit cards. The way to obtain that “fantasy,” Friedman said, was to include a provision in the merchants’ settlement with Visa and MasterCard to require a “level playing field” for such surcharges. Friedman was in constant touch with Ravelo during MasterCard’s settlement negotiations, according to Garaufis, providing her with the plaintiffs’ strategy memos and even volunteering to draft a paragraph on the level playing field provision for Ravelo to present to MasterCard. At the same time, the judge said, he passed to her information about Amex’s negotiating position and the class posture in that case. “This interaction between the (MasterCard) settlement and the (Amex) settlement agreement illustrates why Friedman’s apparent collaboration with Ravelo is so troubling,” Judge Garaufis said. “Friedman’s ability to be a zealous advocate for the class was compromised by his collaboration with counsel for MasterCard, an entity with interests divergent to those of the class; there is reason to be concerned that he was not acting solely in the class’s interests when he, teamed with Ravelo, engaged in settlement negotiations and decision-making.” The judge effectively outlines the interdependence of the two settlements. But the challenge for objectors in the MasterCard case will be to show Friedman or Ravelo had decision-making authority over that settlement. That won’t be easy. The class was represented by lead counsel from Robins Kaplan; Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd; and Berger & Montague, with Friedman just in a supporting role. MasterCard’s lead counsel was Ken Gallo of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison, not Keila Ravelo. And as settlement proponents in the MasterCard case have said repeatedly, their deal - including the level playing field provision - was proposed by an independent mediator in December 2011. Much of the correspondence between Friedman and Ravelo that Judge Garaufis cites came after the mediator had already suggested the provision. Overturning the MasterCard settlement is still a very long shot, but Judge Garaufis’ Amex ruling may improve the odds for settlement detractors. Objectors have submitted briefs calling for judgment in the case to be vacated to Visa, MasterCard and class counsel. Settlement proponents have until Aug. 18 to respond.

413,MA,Target reaches agreement with Visa over data breach,"(Reuters) - Target Corp said it has reached an agreement with Visa Inc card issuers to reimburse up to $67 million in costs related to a data breach at the retailer in 2013, according to a source familiar with the matter. The breach during the holiday shopping season compromised at least 40 million credit cards and may have resulted in the theft of personal information from as many as 110 million people. The agreement comes three months after a proposed $19 million settlement between Target and Mastercard Inc fell through as not enough banks accepted the deal. A lawyer representing banks that are suing Target said financial institutions should not accept the “optional alternative recovery offer” as that requires them to release the retailer from a class action lawsuit. “Just as with the proposed MasterCard settlement...this deal was negotiated under a veil of secrecy without the involvement of the court or the court-appointed legal representatives of financial institutions,” Charles Zimmerman of Zimmerman Reed said. The Mastercard deal required the approval of banks that issued at least 90 percent of the MasterCard accounts. “(The agreement with Visa) fails to fully reimburse card issuers for the substantial losses suffered from the Target data breach,” Zimmerman said in an email on Tuesday. Financial institutions have sued Target, saying they have spent billions of dollars to replace compromised cards and beef up customer service operations because of the data breach. Target said on Tuesday the agreement with Visa was based on a condition that a subset of Visa card issuers entered into direct settlements with Target and Visa. Target’s breach was followed by an attack on Home Depot Inc  which revealed theft of some 56 million payment cards in September last year. More recently, office supplies retailer Staples Inc  said about 1.16 million payments may have been affected by a data breach it had announced in October.

Sam’s Club will also accept Amex’s Bluebird prepaid debit card, sold in Wal-Mart stores, which was launched in 2012 as an alternative to bank checking accounts that can carry high fees. American Express lost a crucial relationship with Sam’s Club competitor Costco Wholesale Corp earlier this year. Costco stopped accepting Amex cards exclusively, and switched to Visa instead.

Amex said in February the loss of Costco would hurt its earnings for the next two years, and threaten nearly 8 percent of the worldwide annual spending on its cards. Sam’s Club says it is the eighth largest U.S. retailer, with more than 650 locations in the United States and Puerto Rico.

A lawyer for retailers including Target Corp (TGT.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) urged the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York to reject the deal, saying it forces merchants to give up their rights to sue over various policies and practices. “The defendants are trying to buy something that is not for sale,” said Thomas Goldstein, the lawyer. But Paul Clement, a lawyer for merchants who negotiated the deal, said the settlement was fair and provided not just $5.7 billion but reforms an expert valued as worth up to $62 billion. “There was meaningful relief here,” he said. The settlement, the largest in a U.S. antitrust class action, resolved lawsuits by merchants pending since 2005. The lawsuits accused Visa and MasterCard of fixing the fees they were charged each time customers used credit or debit cards. Merchants also claimed Visa and MasterCard prevented retailers from encouraging customers to use cheaper payment methods. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn in 2013 approved the deal, saying it provided significant monetary award and meaningful relief. The settlement provides for cash payments to merchants and lets them begin charging customers a surcharge when they use Visa or MasterCard credit cards. Around 8,000 merchants, representing 25 percent of the transactional volume at issue, opted out of the deal, driving its value down to $5.7 billion from $7.2 billion. Over 30 lawsuits by those opt-outs are pending.

420,MA,UPDATE 1-China forex regulator says to cap overseas cash withdrawals,"* Regulator caps annual cash withdrawals via UnionPay cards * Annual limit at 100,000 yuan, daily limit at 10,000 yuan * Coincides with recent steps to curb capital outflows * New restrictions also apply to Visa, MasterCard   (Adds details, quotes) BEIJING, Sept 30 (Reuters) - China will introduce an annual cap of 100,000 yuan ($15,734) on cash withdrawals made through UnionPay cards outside the country  from 2016, the nation’s foreign exchange regulator said, to combat money laundering amid concerns about capital flight. Cards issued by Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc  will also be subject to the annual cash withdrawal limit, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a statement on its website. The current rule only sets a daily withdrawal limit of 10,000 yuan per card. For the last three months of this year, the maximum amount of cash that can be withdrawn overseas using a single card will be 50,000 yuan, SAFE said. The step was aimed at curbing “money laundering risks” after it found some unusual activities among card holders, it said. “Recent monitoring found that some UnionPay card holders have made frequent, large cash withdrawals overseas, foreign financial regulators have also alerted on this,” the SAFE said. The announcement by SAFE confirmed an earlier Reuters report. Chinese law prohibits individuals from transferring more than $50,000 out of the country per year, but overseas cash withdrawals via bank cards provided a regulatory loophole. The move coincided with recent steps by China to stem capital outflows. Banks have been told to bolster checks on foreign exchange transactions and identify “abnormal” cross-border fund transfers. Worries over China’s economic slowdown and possible interest rate rises by the U.S. Federal Reserve have led to a wave of capital outflows that intensified after China’s surprise yuan devaluation in August.

421,MA,UPDATE 1-Scotiabank to buy JPMorgan's Sears Canada credit card portfolio,"(Adds details, background) Oct 15 (Reuters) - Bank of Nova Scotia said it would buy JPMorgan & Chase Co’s Canadian credit card portfolio associated with Sears Canada Inc, a month ahead of the expiry of the servicing agreement by the U.S. bank. JPMorgan said in November last year that it served the retailer with a notice of non-renewal to prevent the agreement, which expires Nov. 15, 2015, from auto-renewing. Scotiabank said on Thursday that it will buy JPMorgan’s MasterCard and private label credit card portfolio, which has about C$1.7 billion ($1.32 billion) in receivables and 2 million active customer accounts. The deal, which will add to Scotiabank’s earnings in the first year, will impact the company’s common equity tier-one capital ratio by less than 10 basis points, the company said. JPMorgan had purchased the credit card receivables business in 2005, enabling Sears Canada to pay out a special dividend to investors that year. The deal is the latest for Scotiabank, which signed agreements last year to buy a majority stake in retailer Cencosud SA’s retail credit card business in Chile and Citigroup Inc’s retail and commercial banking operations in Peru.

425,MA,Foreign bank card firms fear tough China regulatory regime,"* Foreign firms may have to partner with local cos - sources * China Unionpay currently has monopoly on payment card market * Forcing foreign cos into partnerships may breach 2012 WTO ruling * China tipped to be world’s biggest payment card market by 2020 By Matthew Miller and Michael Martina BEIJING, Oct 27 (Reuters) - China is considering imposing tough new conditions on overseas bank card providers such as Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc, in a potential setback to their plans to enter the country’s $7 trillion card payments market, according to people familiar with discussions. Industry sources, lawyers and U.S. business lobbies are worried that Chinese regulators will push foreign card firms to operate through a domestic consortium and may try to force them to partner with local companies and governments, reducing the amount of control they would have over their businesses and limiting their returns. Such measures, if implemented, would be a blow to global card payment firms, which have been lobbying for more than a decade to access the world’s fastest-growing cards market, projected to become the biggest by 2020. It may also defy a 2012 World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling that found China was discriminating against U.S. credit card firms by allowing China UnionPay, a state-controlled consortium, a monopoly on all yuan payment cards issued and used in the country. The State Council, the government’s cabinet, announced in April that China would open the card market to all properly-licensed domestic and foreign businesses, a move precipitated by the 2012 WTO ruling. But possible new conditions have been raised in discussions between card companies and domestic enterprises and municipal governments in the months since the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued its draft implementation regulations, sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Jeremie Waterman, Greater China executive director at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told the U.S. Trade Representative this month in testimony that any foreign card provider may be required to join a domestic consortium to get a licence, limiting their operational control. “We hope the State Council’s April decision ... will allow qualified foreign electronic payments firms to set up bank clearing operations in the near future - even as we are receiving reports that Chinese regulators may award new licences only to those foreign companies that partner with domestic companies,” Waterman said. There have also been discussions about whether to limit the number of licences granted to the foreign card companies, with the possibility that just one or two might be issued, sources said on condition of anonymity. “The concern on the number of licences that will be issued to foreign companies is still there,” one lawyer familiar with the issue told Reuters. Industry watchers expect the PBOC’s implementation regulations to be out imminently. The PBOC declined to comment on the issue and China’s Ministry of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment. The initial qualifications that were publicly outlined by the State Council earlier this year were already seen as onerous by some legal professionals, including requirements that applicants hold 1 billion yuan ($157 million) in registered capital in a local company, and store data and infrastructure inside mainland China. Even if the new conditions are not included in the text of the forthcoming PBOC regulations, there are concerns they could be imposed as unwritten rules. “If you look at other sectors, they are making those kinds of demands in high-tech, automobiles, and commercial airliners. So, that general pressure for foreign companies to partner with state-owned companies is growing,” said Scott Kennedy, Director of the Project on Chinese Business and Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Kennedy said that while lawyers would debate whether such requirements comply with China’s WTO mandate, they would be inconsistent with the spirit of the 2012 ruling and Beijing’s original commitment to open access to financial markets. “I think people would read it for what it is - wanting to make sure that whatever access is given to foreign companies, the benefits still accrue to domestic companies,” Kennedy said. A spokeswoman for Visa declined to comment. MasterCard told Reuters it “has established strong industry partnerships” in China and that open payment systems would promote growth and reduce systemic risk. “We will continue to monitor closely and look forward to the day when we can compete for domestic business in China,” the company said in a statement. MasterCard and UnionPay signed an agreement in 2010 to issue co-branded cards that Chinese people could use when travelling overseas. Critics have argued China’s limitations on foreign card players sought to protect the country’s then nascent domestic industry from competition, allowing UnionPay unfettered access at a time of explosive growth in the interbank card market. Currently, China requires all foreign card companies to use UnionPay’s network when accepting yuan payments, effectively giving it a cut of every credit or debit card transaction. Foreign card issuers in most other countries pay only the bank involved in the transaction because they can use their own networks. At the same time, UnionPay has been expanding rapidly outside China as it battles MasterCard and Visa for global market share. UnionPay is now the world’s largest card brand with more than 5 billion cards issued internationally since its founding in 2002.

432,MA,"Apparel demand up, electronics flat over U.S. Black Friday weekend: MasterCard","(Reuters) - Apparel-focused U.S. retailers saw sales perk up over the four-day promotional period that kicked off on Thanksgiving Day, though department-store and electronics revenue was roughly flat, a MasterCard executive told Reuters in an interview Monday. Specialty-apparel retailers enjoyed a pick-up in sales over the extended holiday weekend that began on Thursday as colder weather unleashed pent-up demand for winter clothing, Sarah Quinlan, a senior vice president at MasterCard, said in a sneak preview of an upcoming spending report by the company. Department stores, however, did not enjoy a similar boost, reflecting the segment’s ongoing struggles to attract consumers, Quinlan said.  Based on initial checks, the segment’s sales were “about flat,” she said, although that could mark an improvement after 14 straight months of decline. “All year long, department stores have remained very very challenged. That will still continue to be the case,” Quinlan said. Specialty apparel retailers include companies like the Gap Inc (GPS.N), while department stores include Macys Inc (M.N) and Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O)  Quinlan’s comments come ahead of the release on Wednesday of Mastercard’s report on consumer spending during the Black Friday weekend, from Nov. 26 to Nov. 29.  The weekend traditionally has marked the start of the holiday shopping season, although retailers have begun promotions earlier in the month. The report, which tracks spending by combining sales activity in MasterCard’s payments network with estimates of cash and other payment forms, is also likely to show a “muted” performance for electronics. Electronics sales were being held back by a lack of new, “hot items” and by falling prices, Quinlan said. Mastercard was expecting the segment’s sales to be “basically flat” over the entire holiday season through end-December. Online sales growth was in the double digits over the extended Thanksgiving weekend, beating MasterCard’s forecast for about 8 percent growth, Quinlan said.

451,MA,UPDATE 1-Hong Kong April retail sales fall for 14th straight month,"(Adds details, comments) * April sales of jewellery, watches down 16.6 pct y/y * April tourists fall 2.1 pct y/y, mainland visitors down 4 pct * MasterCard’s April retail sales in Hong Kong fall 5.7 pct HONG KONG, May 31 (Reuters) - Hong Kong’s retail sales fell for the 14th successive month in April, as a drop in tourists and weak local consumption deepened the pain for retailers in the city. Retail sales in April slid 7.5 percent from a year earlier to HK$35.2 billion ($4.5 billion) in value terms, less than a 9.8 percent slump in March. In volume terms, April sales dropped 7.6 percent, government data showed on Tuesday. “Many types of retail outlet still recorded notable falls in sales, reflecting the continued drag from the slowdown in inbound tourism as well as the more cautious local consumer sentiment amid subpar economic conditions,” the government said in a statement. Hong Kong is struggling with mounting economic challenges from the prospect of rising U.S. interest rates, which has stepped up capital outflows, and from China’s economic slowdown. Mainland tourists are avoiding the city amid political tensions with China and growing calls from radical activists for greater autonomy from Beijing. “The near-term outlook for retail sales will continue to depend on the performance of inbound tourism,” the government added. Hong Kong tourist arrivals in April fell 2.1 percent from a year earlier to 4.69 million, after sliding 4.3 percent in March. Mainland visitors, which accounted for 73.8 percent of the total, fell 4 percent to 3.46 million in April. (bit.ly/1WupAMF) April sales of jewellery, watches, clocks and valuable gifts fell 16.6 percent in value terms, a 20th consecutive month of decline. Department store sales slid 6.8 percent on year, while wearing apparel fell 5.9 percent. MasterCard’s MasterCard Advisors said its retail sales in Hong Kong in April contracted 5.7 percent from a year earlier amid declining Chinese tourism and subdued local spending. A string of retailers from jewellery firms to cosmetics retailers have warned of weaker sales amid a decline in mainland tourists and weak consumer sentiment. Chow Tai Fook Jewellery and cosmetic chain Sa Sa International had warned that their annual profit for the year ended in March could be half what it reported last year. General merchandise stores operator AEON Stores  said they would swing into the red for the six months ending in June, while apparel chain Bauhaus expected its net profit for the year ended in March to fall 70 percent.

455,MA,Supreme Court agrees to review ATM fee antitrust lawsuit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear appeals by Visa Inc, Mastercard Inc and several U.S. banks seeking to throw out lawsuits claiming they conspired to inflate the prices of ATM access fees in violation of antitrust law. The high court will hear the companies’ bid to overturn an August 2015 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that revived three related class action lawsuits. The appeals court said a district court erred when it concluded that consumers had no standing to sue and had not adequately alleged antitrust violations. It remanded the three consolidated lawsuits to the district court for further proceedings. The decision revived two class action suits brought by consumers and another one brought by independent ATM operators. Their lawsuits accused Visa and MasterCard of adopting rules protecting themselves from competition with a lower-cost ATM network. The rules blocked ATM operators from charging less when ATM transactions were processed by networks competing with Visa and Mastercard, the lawsuits said. The rules also benefited major banks, which were equity shareholders of Visa and Mastercard, the lawsuits said. The lawsuits seek damages for consumers and ATM operators for violations of antitrust law. The lawsuits said that the banks controlled Visa and MasterCard and set higher ATM charges before the credit card companies went public in 2008 and 2006, respectively.

459,MA,COLUMN- 'Glaring' conflict doomed Visa/MasterCard settlement: Frankel,"(The opinions expressed here are those of Alison Frankel, a columnist for Reuters.) By Alison Frankel NEW YORK June 30 (Reuters) - The biggest money-damages antitrust settlement in U.S. history died Thursday at the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals. Not because of last year’s scandal surrounding leaks to a onetime MasterCard lawyer since charged with fraud, but because the agreement between credit card giants MasterCard, Visa and the merchants suing them for inflating certain fees was fundamentally unfair to some of the retailers. A three-judge appellate panel at the New York-based federal appeals court reversed U.S. District Judge John Gleeson’s 2012 approval of the $7.25 billion settlement, holding that the agreement failed to resolve basic conflicts between merchants entitled to money damages and a separate class forced to release future claims in exchange for revisions to some of the rules governing credit card fees. Lawyers representing the class were awarded $544.8 million based on the money damages they obtained, not based on the rule changes the credit card companies agree to. That dynamic, according to the 2nd Circuit, “sapped class counsel of the incentive to zealously represent” merchants in the injunction-only class, who could not opt out of the settlement. Named plaintiffs and class counsel, the appellate court said, could not adequately represent the interests of the two different groups of merchants. “Class representatives had interests antagonistic to those of some of the class members they were representing,” wrote Judge Dennis Jacobs for a panel that also included Judges Pierre Leval and Ralph Winter. “The fault lines were glaring as to matters of fundamental importance. Such conflicts and absence of incentive required a sufficient ‘structural assurance of fair and adequate representation,’ but none was provided,” the opinion said, quoting from the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark 1997 class action opinion, Amchem v. Windsor. I should point out that the appellate court specifically said it did not intend to “impugn the motives or acts of class counsel,” including lawyers from Robins Kaplan, Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd and Berger & Montague. “Nonetheless, class counsel was charged with an inequitable task,” Judge Jacobs wrote. The 2nd Circuit said the Supreme Court’s rulings in Amchem and its 1999 successor, Ortiz v. Fibreboard, compel appellate courts to look skeptically at class action settlements that release defendants from claims by absent plaintiffs. In this case, the court said, the terms of the injunction proved that merchants — including those that haven’t even yet set up shop — were not adequately represented. The rule changes MasterCard and Visa agreed to make would offer no relief at all to large swaths of the class, such as merchants that also accept American Express and those in states that do not allow fee surcharges. Yet the settlement precluded all merchants that accept MasterCard and Visa from ever suing the companies over rules not specifically addressed in the deal. The appellate opinion called the release “exceptionally broad.” In a concurring opinion, Judge Leval added, “This is not a settlement; it is a confiscation.” He continued: “No merchants operating from November 28, 2012, until the end of time will ever be allowed to sue the defendants, either for damages or for an injunction, complaining of any conduct (other than that enjoined) that could have been alleged in the present suit,” he wrote. “One class of plaintiffs receives money as compensation for the defendants’ arguable past violations, and in return gives up the future rights of others. The Supreme Court has addressed such circumstances and ruled that an adjudication coming to this result is impermissible.” Precedent in the 2nd Circuit, according to the opinion, discourages approval of class action settlements in which a single set of lawyers attempts to represent two different classes with conflicting interests. Judge Jacobs peppered the decision with references to the 2nd Circuit’s 2011 decision in In re Literary Works, which involved a class action copyright dispute between authors and online publishers. In that case, as in the Visa/MasterCard ruling, the appeals court said the deal did not adequately represent the interests of all class members. (Thursday’s opinion distinguished the facts in those two cases from those in 2013’s Charron v. Wiener, in which the 2nd Circuit upheld approval of multiclass settlement negotiated by a single set of lawyers - but only after the two classes were separately certified.) Interestingly, the 2nd Circuit emphasized that trial judges cannot paper over basic conflicts among class members by involving themselves or court-appointed mediators in the negotiating process. Judge Gleeson, who has since left the bench in Brooklyn federal court, helped shape the Visa/MasterCard settlement, as did U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein and other mediators. The 2nd Circuit said their involvement didn’t solve the fundamental problem: “One aspect of the settlement agreement that emphatically cannot remedy the inadequate representation is the assistance of judges and mediators in the bargaining process.” My colleague Jon Stempel has reactions from several of the interested parties in his Reuters piece about the 2nd Circuit’s rejection of the settlement, although Paul Clement of Bancroft — who argued at the 2nd Circuit for class counsel — didn’t get back to him. (Thomas Goldstein of Goldstein & Russell argued for the merchants who objected to the settlement.) For lawyers, the important message from the ruling is that no matter how hard you work — and no one doubts the incredible effort of the lawyers and judges who slogged through a decade on this litigation, including years of settlement negotiation — the 2nd Circuit is not going to look favorably at class action settlements in which one set of lawyers represents class members with competing interests. Adding more lawyers (and class representatives) complicates settlement talks, especially in an already vast case like this one. But you have to be able to show the 2nd Circuit that everyone’s interests were protected. It’s a lot easier to take care of that before you reach a settlement than to return to negotiations after your proposed deal is struck down.   (Reporting by Alison Frankel.

460,MA,"Visa, MasterCard $7.25 billion settlement with retailers is thrown out","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Thursday threw out a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement reached by Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) with millions of retailers that accused the card networks of improperly fixing credit and debit card fees. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said the accord was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and, in the court’s view, little or no benefit at all. It also decertified the case as a class action. “This is not a settlement; it is a confiscation,” wrote Circuit Judge Pierre Leval, a member of the three-judge panel that unanimously struck down the settlement. The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, though its value shrank to about $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers “opted out.” Thursday’s decision is a blow to the credit card industry, which hoped the settlement would end a decade of litigation brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers against Visa, MasterCard and banks that issue their cards. It was intended to resolve claims that merchants were overcharged on interchange fees, or swipe fees, when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and were barred from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment. The settlement may now need to be renegotiated, or the case could go to trial. “Swipe fees are an improper and unnecessary hidden tax on consumers,” said Jeffrey Shinder, a Constantine Cannon partner representing Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other opponents of the accord. “The structure of swipe fees is back on the table.” Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim said the Foster City, California-based company is reviewing the decision. MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen said the company, based in Purchase, New York, is disappointed in the decision and will review its next steps. Visa shares closed down $2.57, or 3.3 percent, at $74.17. MasterCard fell $4.07, or 4.4 percent, to $88.06. The S&P; 500 Information Technology Index .SPLRCT, which includes both, rose 1.1 percent. U.S. District Judge John Gleeson in Brooklyn had approved the settlement in December 2013, saying it offered “significant” damages and meaningful protections against future harm. Many retailers and trade groups nevertheless objected. Some said the payout should have been higher. Others said the accord would have made it too hard to sue Visa and MasterCard. Wal-Mart, in a statement, said the settlement would also have “stifled innovation around new payments technologies and left consumers facing continually increasing hidden swipe fees.” Card issuers American Express Co (AXP.N) and Discover Financial Services (DFS.N) also objected to the settlement. The National Retail Federation said retailers pay roughly $60 billion annually in swipe fees, which typically average around 2 percent. Mallory Duncan, the group’s general counsel, told Reuters in an interview that the settlement would have “forever” shielded card networks from a variety of litigation, while giving retailers “at best” three cents on the dollar in damages. Thursday’s decision “will give real incentives to the card networks to rethink their anti-competitive behavior,” he said. Paul Clement, who led the appeal for retailers supporting the accord, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Card-issuing banks would have funded much of the settlement. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) had estimated they were responsible for roughly one-fifth and one-tenth, respectively, of a payout. Both declined to comment. The settlement had called for retailers that accepted Visa or MasterCard from January 2004 to November 2012 to share in as much as $7.25 billion, with the ability to opt out. Retailers that accepted the cards from then on, meanwhile, were to get injunctive relief in the form of rule changes, expiring in July 2021, and could not opt out. Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs said these groups’ divergent interests meant they should not have been represented by the same law firms, which were awarded $544.8 million of fees. While making clear he did not question the firms’ motives, Jacobs said the conflict “sapped” their incentive to zealously represent the retailers obtaining injunctive relief, and led to terms that benefited other retailers at their expense. The case will return to the Brooklyn federal court, where it will be overseen by U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie.

473,MA,MasterCard may apply for China payment license this year,"BEIJING (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc (MA.N) hopes to apply this year to become a payment service provider in China after the government opened the market, but the company is still weighing whether to do so alone or with a partner, senior executives said on Friday. The world’s most populous country is “pretty crucial” to its future, but MasterCard is still studying rules in China that would affect its business and is hammering out a business plan, Ann Cairns, president of international markets, told Reuters in an interview. China in June allowed foreign payment card companies to operate in the country under new rules, potentially giving companies like MasterCard and Visa Inc (V.N) access to its 55 trillion yuan ($8.25 trillion) card payment market.  Under the rules, China’s national security and cyber security standards must be met. Applicants must also hold 1 billion yuan in registered capital in a local company. “We’re trying to understand the rules,” Cairns said, adding that MasterCard would like to enter China as soon as possible. “Certain things inside the rules – such as the new cyber rules, which need more development and understanding about how they’re going to work.” Visa and MasterCard, the world’s two largest credit and debit card companies, have been lobbying for more than a decade for direct access to China’s cards market, projected to become the world’s biggest by 2020. Asked if it was possible that MasterCard submits a license application this calendar year, Ling Hai, co-president for Asia-Pacific, said that was the hope but there were no guarantees. “There is so much uncertainty and variability in the process. Something that should take one year can take two years,” he said. Bank card consumer transactions reached 55 trillion yuan in 2015, accounting for 48 percent of total social consumption, according to the People’s Bank of China. The market is dominated by state-run China UnionPay Co. Asked what was holding MasterCard back from jumping in, Cairns said it hinged on the business model and which local partners it decides to go with. Cairns said capital requirements, security standards and for MasterCard to be locally based did not represent obstacles to the company. MasterCard has never said it was under pressure to partner in China, according to Cairns.

Mastercard was accused of doing this for 16 years between 1992 and 2008, according to the documents filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal on Thursday.

499,MA,Financial services cheer India's shock bank note curbs,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s abolition of 500- and 1,000-rupee notes with virtually no warning caused confusion and concern among ordinary people and in sectors of the economy where cash is king, but banks and electronic payment services are among those licking their lips. Among the biggest losers from the shock move, aimed at flushing out money hidden from the tax man in India’s huge shadow economy, is expected to be property, and the sharp drop in the sector’s stocks on India’s two main exchanges on Wednesday reflected that. It was better news for financial services companies involved in moving money around the formal economy, however, and among them was PayTM, India’s top mobile payment wallet services provider. It said it saw a 200 percent jump in app downloads and a 1,000 percent increase in the amount of money added to its wallets since Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of the curbs late on Tuesday. MobiKwik, which also offers mobile wallet services, said it saw a more than 40 percent increase in app downloads. “We’ll be a country with a lot more digital transactions and payments now,” said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, chief executive of PayTM, whose biggest shareholder is Alibaba Group (BABA.N). India’s shadow, or “black”, economy is estimated to be the size of about a fifth of its gross domestic product, with millions still having no access to formal financial services. Most financial transactions still happen in cash, although alternative payments and the use of cards have risen fast in recent years. Kotak Securities said it expected a large part of the shadow economy to become part of the formal economy, including the banking system, over time. Banks will benefit from higher savings deposits, while more financial savings also bodes well for insurance, mutual funds and wealth management companies, analysts said. Shares in top lender State Bank of India (SBI.NS) rose 2.9 percent on Wednesday on a Mumbai market .NSEI that closed 1.3 percent lower. The banking sector index  edged up 0.1 percent. Global card network providers Visa and MasterCard welcomed the Indian decision, saying it would help cashless transactions. PayPal Holdings Inc called it a “master stroke” to make India a less cash-reliant economy. The crackdown on unaccounted wealth will put further pressure on the real estate sector, considered a safe haven for “black” money and already battling slower home sales. The impact will likely be felt by smaller developers and in the secondary sales market, making the real estate sector more illiquid for some time, said Anshul Jain, managing director for India at consultant Cushman & Wakefield.  “Working capital needs for small and medium developers and other businesses will be a lot higher,” said Jain, adding that prices will correct in markets where substantial speculative investments have been made using unregistered cash. DLF Ltd (DLF.NS), India’s biggest listed property developer, slumped more than 17 percent in Mumbai trading on Wednesday, while the sector index .NIFTYREAL fell 11.6 percent. A DLF spokesman, however, said the bank note move would not make “any big difference” for larger real estate companies who carried out transactions through banking channels.  “It is only a popular perception that real estate spawns black money, which is actually not true.” The crackdown is also seen as negative for jewelers, as it could lower the demand for gold despite a short-term rush for the precious metal late on Tuesday, analysts said. “Significant amounts of demand for gold used to get generated (by) unaccounted wealth,” said Surendra Mehta, Secretary at India Bullion and Jewelers Association. “Since such unaccounted money is set to lose value after the scrapping of 500 rupee and 1,000 rupee notes, demand for gold will also drop.” Mehta estimated India’s gold demand would fall by 100-150 tonnes next year from an annual average of about 800 tonnes. The central bank will launch a new series of 500 and 2,000 rupee notes later this week. Other sectors that could be impacted in the short term due to shifts in demand include consumer goods and automobiles, Edelweiss Securities said. Cement makers such as ACC (ACC.NS) and UltraTech (ULTC.NS) will be hit, as 70 percent of demand comes from housing, HDFC Securities analysts said, adding that they expected cement companies to cut production. Food chain operators such as those run by Jubilant FoodWorks (JUBI.NS), which operates the Domino’s Pizza and Dunkin’ Donuts chains in India, will also be temporarily affected as students mostly buy in cash, the brokerage added.

503,MA,"SCOTUS dismissal of ATM fees case: Visa, MasterCard swung for a home run, called out on strikes","(Reuters) - I doubt that when history books survey the shocking events of November 2016, they will spare many words for the U.S. Supreme Court’s announcement late Thursday that it had dismissed a pair of cases involving credit card networks and ATM fees ranks. But for lawyers in the elite ranks of the Supreme Court bar, the justices’ order – which said that Visa, MasterCard and bank members of credit card networks had changed their argument after persuading the court to take their case -- created a considerable stir in the elite appellate bar, not least because counsel of record for Visa and the other petitioners is Neal Katyal of Hogan Lovells, a former acting U.S. solicitor general and extremely accomplished Supreme Court litigator.  So what happened?  I should say right here that I don’t know for sure. Katyal didn’t respond to my email requesting comment and the lawyers I spoke with didn’t want to go on the record, for the most part. But those conversations and filings in the Supreme Court cases – there were two parallel proceedings with different respondents – suggest that the credit card companies briefed their petitions for Supreme Court review on quite narrow grounds that, even if they prevailed, wouldn’t be especially useful to them in the future. Once they reached the Supreme Court, though, they asserted a bolder argument that, had they won it, would have given their industry broad antitrust protection.  Strategically, in other words, the credit card companies may have been willing to risk the rare indignity of having their cases tossed for the chance of winning a decision worth potentially billions of dollars. The justices don’t seem to have appreciated that gamesmanship.  The underlying litigation alleged that Visa and MasterCard - which at the time operated as associations of member banks - and their member banks violated the Sherman Act by jacking up the fees for independent ATMs to access their networks. A trial judge in Washington, D.C., dismissed the cases, finding, among other things, that the plaintiffs hadn’t shown restraint of trade. The District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived the suits in 2015.  An array of distinguished firms represented Visa, MasterCard and the banks in their petition for certiorari: Arnold & Porter; Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom, Morrison & Foerster, Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison. Their argument was that the D.C. Circuit split with the 9th Circuit in a nearly identical case (and more broadly with other federal circuits) when it held that mere membership in and adherence to the rules of the Visa and MasterCard networks was sufficient to allege members engaged in an antitrust conspiracy. The cert petitions defined the question presented as: “Whether allegations that members of a business association agreed to adhere to the association's rules and possess governance rights in the association, without more, are sufficient to plead the element of conspiracy in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.”  Despite opposition from the consumers and from the independent ATM operators that had brought the underlying suits – which argued that the D.C. Circuit didn’t look only at membership in the Visa and MasterCard associations but at additional evidence of collusion as well – the justices agreed to take the cases to hear the question the credit card companies presented.  Between the cert grant on June 28 and the opening merits brief, Visa, MasterCard and the banks changed their counsel of record, bringing in Katyal of Hogan Lovells. The credit card companies and banks also changed their argument, though they didn’t say so. Instead of asserting that membership in a business association is not sufficient evidence of members participating in antitrust conspiracy, Katyal made the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in American Needle v. National Football League the centerpiece of his merits brief. American Needle, you’ll recall, involved an antitrust challenge to NFL teams for granting apparel licenses as a group.  Though the NFL lost, the credit card companies’ merits brief asserted that the Supreme Court considered the teams a single entity – a sort of joint marketing venture. Each credit card company and its network of banks, the merits brief said, should be viewed not as horizontal competitors engaged in a conspiracy to fix ATM access fees but as a single network. “The D.C. Circuit thought respondents’ circumstantial allegations regarding the banks’ role in each network’s governance were enough” to let the case proceed, the brief said, citing American Needle. “But every joint venture involves cooperation between legally distinct entities, often with respect to how the venture will be run. And nothing in the complaints suggests the rules were the product of each network’s member banks’ ‘act[ing] on interests separate from those of’ their network.”  Now it’s important to remember that Visa and MasterCard are no longer membership associations – the subject of the question presented in the cert petition. But both still operate in networks with the banks that offer their cards. And both face big-dollar claims that they and their bank members collude on fees. If the Supreme Court were to agree with the Visa and MasterCard reframing of their networks’ activities in the ATM fee case, wrote Thomas Goldstein of Goldstein & Russell in a response brief for the independent ATM operators, “it is hard to see how competitors could ever be subject to suit under Section 1 for the activities of a joint venture.”  Goldstein’s brief pointed out that Visa and the other petitioners had not even mentioned American Needle or joint ventures when they asked the Supreme Court for review. Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, which represents the consumer respondents, said the same it its brief. So did the Justice Department in its filing in support of the respondents. All of the briefs urged the justices not to allow Visa and MasterCard to game the Supreme Court.  “Departing from this court’s settled practice of deciding only the Question Presented would be particularly improvident in this case,” Goldstein wrote. “The issue petitioners belatedly raise is central to an array of Section 1 claims against petitioners in other suits that have not yet been decided in the lower courts. Those cases involve a wide variety of restraints that have not even been described to this court, much less briefed in a manner that could permit a reasoned decision on such important matters. … Indeed, petitioners’ goal in pivoting their argument in this court so radically is almost certainly to secure such sweeping antitrust immunity, short-circuiting the other suits they now face.”  The justices gave Visa, MasterCard and their counsel a chance to respond, but in briefs filed earlier this week, Katyal mostly reargued the credit card companies’ position on antitrust and joint ventures, though he did point out that the consumer opposition to certiorari raised American Needle. The credit card companies’ joint venture assertions, the response brief said, fall squarely within the question that was presented in the cert petition.  Obviously, the justices disagreed, since they dismissed the cases the day after the response briefs were filed. The Supreme Court apparently had an open mind about whether to allow the credit card companies to expand their argument as recently as Nov. 14, when it granted the solicitor general’s office permission to participate in the scheduled Dec. 7 oral argument. It seems that the response briefs must have resolved any doubts, to the detriment of the credit card companies.",11192016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-visa/scotus-dismissal-of-atm-fees-case-visa-mastercard-swung-for-a-home-run-called-out-on-strikes-idUSKBN13E03X

506,MA,Competition watchdog sees concerns with MasterCard's VocaLink deal,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s competition watchdog said it has concerns with  MasterCard Inc’s (MA.N) acquisition of UK payment processing company VocaLink Holdings, following a review of the ownership and competitiveness of companies supporting those systems. “A number of industry participants have raised concerns with the transaction,” the Competition and Markets Authority said in a statement on Wednesday. The companies are two of the three most credible providers of infrastructure services to the LINK network of automated teller machines, the CMA said, meaning the $920 million merger could reduce LINK’s negotiating power with those providers if they combined. A spokesman for MasterCard said it would address the watchdog’s concern, adding that the CMA had said it had no other worries about the deal. “We’re pleased to have the opportunity to address their one concern, regarding the LINK ATM scheme, in the timeframe provided,” the spokesman said in an email.  MasterCard said in July it would buy a 92.4 percent stake in London-based VocaLink Holdings Ltd for about $920 million. The companies have until Jan. 11 to address the CMA’s concern.      The LINK network connects over 70,000 cash machines, nearly every single one in the United Kingdom, and is one of three major payment systems in the UK. The network allows customers of banks and building societies connected to LINK to withdraw cash from any of those machines.  The CMA said it found the deal would not impact the other two networks since they had many credible potential bidders for service contracts. “The companies can avoid the merger being referred for an in-depth investigation if they can offer a remedy to address the competition concerns identified,” the CMA said.  Britain’s finance minister Philip Hammond in July hailed MasterCard’s planned takeover of VocaLink as a sign of foreign investors’ continued confidence after Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said earlier this month that it was worried the deal could lead to the combined group having too much control over Britain’s LINK network of Automatic Telling Machines (ATMs), which connects 70,000 cash machines across the country. Mastercard and VocaLink are two of the three biggest providers of infrastructure services to the LINK network, meaning the 701 million pounds($864 million) merger could reduce LINK’s negotiating power. CMA said on Wednesday that Mastercard had now set out a number of proposals, including VocaLink making its connectivity infrastructure available to a new supplier of infrastructure services to LINK, which it has accepted in principle. Mastercard said it was pleased with the decision. The CMA says it has until March 15 to consider whether to formally accept the proposed undertakings, although it may extend this deadline by two months if it decides that there are special reasons for doing so. The other proposed remedies include VocaLink transferring or licensing to LINK the intellectual property rights relating to the system used by members of the network use to communicate when customers use cash machines and VocaLink contributing to LINK members’ switching costs.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said earlier this month that it was worried the deal could lead to the combined group having too much control over Britain’s LINK network of Automatic Telling Machines (ATMs), which connects 70,000 cash machines across the country.

513,MA,"George Soros, Mastercard to partner to aid migrants, refugees","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor George Soros will partner with Mastercard Inc on a venture they said could help migrants, refugees and others struggling within their communities worldwide to improve their economic and social status. The partnership, Humanity Ventures, stems from a pledge Soros made in September to earmark up to $500 million for investments to address challenges facing migrants and refugees.  In a joint statement on Thursday, Mastercard and Soros said that despite billions of dollars of humanitarian and development assistance, millions of people remain marginalized, a situation the private sector can help rectify. “Migrants are often forced into lives of despair in their host communities because they cannot gain access to financial, healthcare and government services,” Soros said. “Our potential investment in this social enterprise, coupled with Mastercard’s ability to create products that serve vulnerable communities, can show how private capital can play a constructive role in solving social problems,” he added.     Humanity Ventures intends to focus initially on healthcare and education, with a goal of fostering local economic development and entrepreneurship. With the creation of Humanity Ventures, Soros could invest up to $50 million to make these solutions more scalable and sustainable, and perhaps encourage smaller projects committed to mitigating the migration crisis. “Humanity Ventures is intended to be profitable so as to stimulate involvement from other businesspeople,” Soros said. “We also hope to establish standards of practice to ensure that investments are not exploitative of the vulnerable communities we intend to serve.” Soros opened his first foundation, the Open Society Foundations, in 1979 when his hedge fund had reached about $100 million and his personal wealth had climbed to about $25 million. The Open Society Foundations began Soros’s philanthropic activity when he gave scholarships to black South Africans under apartheid. In the 1980s, Soros and his foundations ultimately contributed to the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. Just last week, Soros’ Open Society Foundations said it will keep working with and financing organizations in Hungary despite the government saying that any civil society group should be “swept out.”  ",1192017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-immigration-soros/george-soros-mastercard-to-partner-to-aid-migrants-refugees-idUSKBN1531H2

516,MA,"MasterCard revenue misses estimates hurt by rebates, stronger dollar","(Reuters) - MasterCard Inc (MA.N), the world’s second-biggest payments processor, reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue on Tuesday, reflecting an increase in rebates, incentives and a stronger U.S. dollar. The company, which deals in 150 currencies, also warned that the strong dollar was likely to constrain revenue and earnings growth this year. Purchase, New York-based MasterCard, whose shares were down 3.2 percent, reported revenue of $2.76 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31 - a rise of 9.5 percent from a year earlier but short of the average analysts’ estimate of $2.79 billion. The strong dollar is expected to negatively impact revenue growth by about 2 percent and net earnings by about 3 percent in 2017, Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said. The dollar, already near a 14-year high against the euro, is expected to appreciate further if the U.S. economy picks up speed and inflation rises under the Trump administration. MasterCard’s fourth-quarter net income rose 4.8 percent to $933 million, or 86 cents per share, from $890 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company also earned 86 cents per share, beating the average analysts’ estimate by a cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MasterCard reiterated its 2016-2018 guidance for low double-digit percentage revenue growth and EPS growth in the mid-teens. Revenue growth in the first half of 2017 is likely to be lower than in the second half due to higher incentives, Hund-Mejean said on a call with analysts. Full-year operating expenses are expected to increase by a high single-digit percentage on a currency-neutral basis. MasterCard, which processes more than 65,000 transactions a minute, said gross dollar volumes rose 9 percent to $1.2 trillion in the quarter on a local currency basis. The United States, the company’s largest market, accounted for a little under a third of the total. MasterCard, said cross-border volumes - the value of transactions made by card holders outside the home country of the card-issuer - increased 13 percent. Up to Monday’s close of $109.30, the company’s shares had risen about 23 percent in the past 12 months.

536,MA,MasterCard's profit beats estimates as card-spending rises,"(Reuters) - MasterCard Inc (MA.N), the world’s second-largest payments network, reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue as people spent more using credit and debit cards, sending its shares up as much as 3 percent to a record high. MasterCard and bigger rival Visa Inc (V.N) generate revenue by facilitating credit- and debit-card transactions and their  fortunes are closely tied to the health of the economy and consumer spending. U.S. economic data has been largely positive in the past few months - the labor market has shown signs of improvement, while average wages are also up. Underpinned by a recovering global and U.S. economy, stocks of both MasterCard and Visa, which share a global duopoly, have surged about 19 percent in the past year. But the companies are facing increasing competition from digital payment services as more people use smartphones to make payments, forcing them to ramp up their own e-wallet offerings. MasterCard said on Tuesday it spent $170 million on advertising and marketing in the first quarter, up 26 percent, to support the rollout of Masterpass - its digital wallet service. Advertising and marketing spending in the second quarter is also expected to increase by about $40 million from the year-ago period, Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said on a call with analysts. She also said near-term revenue growth would be affected by a rise in incentives in new and renewed agreements. MasterCard’s net income rose 12.7 percent to $1.08 billion in the first quarter ended March 31. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.01 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 95 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 11.8 percent to $2.73 billion, beating the average estimate of $2.65 billion. (mstr.cd/2qthx67) MasterCard, which processes more than 65,000 transactions a minute, said adjusted gross dollar volumes rose 8 percent to $1.18 trillion in the quarter on a local currency basis. Cross-border volumes - the value of transactions made by card holders abroad - increased 13 percent on a local currency basis. Total costs rose to $1.23 billion from $1.09 billion a year earlier as advertising and marketing spend increased. The company reiterated its 2016-2018 guidance of revenue growth in low double-digits and full-year 2017 operating expenses to grow in the high single-digit range.

537,MA,UPDATE 2-MasterCard's profit beats estimates as card-spending rises,"(Reuters) - MasterCard Inc (MA.N), the world’s second-largest payments network, reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue as people spent more using credit and debit cards, sending its shares up as much as 3 percent to a record high. MasterCard and bigger rival Visa Inc (V.N) generate revenue by facilitating credit- and debit-card transactions and their  fortunes are closely tied to the health of the economy and consumer spending. U.S. economic data has been largely positive in the past few months - the labor market has shown signs of improvement, while average wages are also up. Underpinned by a recovering global and U.S. economy, stocks of both MasterCard and Visa, which share a global duopoly, have surged about 19 percent in the past year. But the companies are facing increasing competition from digital payment services as more people use smartphones to make payments, forcing them to ramp up their own e-wallet offerings. MasterCard said on Tuesday it spent $170 million on advertising and marketing in the first quarter, up 26 percent, to support the rollout of Masterpass - its digital wallet service. Advertising and marketing spending in the second quarter is also expected to increase by about $40 million from the year-ago period, Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said on a call with analysts. She also said near-term revenue growth would be affected by a rise in incentives in new and renewed agreements. MasterCard’s net income rose 12.7 percent to $1.08 billion in the first quarter ended March 31. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.01 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 95 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 11.8 percent to $2.73 billion, beating the average estimate of $2.65 billion. (mstr.cd/2qthx67) MasterCard, which processes more than 65,000 transactions a minute, said adjusted gross dollar volumes rose 8 percent to $1.18 trillion in the quarter on a local currency basis. Cross-border volumes - the value of transactions made by card holders abroad - increased 13 percent on a local currency basis. Total costs rose to $1.23 billion from $1.09 billion a year earlier as advertising and marketing spend increased. The company reiterated its 2016-2018 guidance of revenue growth in low double-digits and full-year 2017 operating expenses to grow in the high single-digit range. MasterCard’s shares were up 2.3 percent at $119.10 in morning trading.

548,MA,UK startup Curve launches 'financial time travel',"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A London-based startup has joined up with Mastercard Inc (MA.N) to launch a payment card that allows users to retroactively choose a different credit or debit card for a purchase they have already made, in what they called “financial time travel”.      Starting Tuesday, Curve will offer customers the chance to “go back in time” and switch the card used for any given transaction for up to two weeks after the purchase, in what it said would be a world first.  The startup also said on Monday that it was planning to announce backing from two large international banks soon, but declined to provide more detailed information.     Curve, which has a patent pending for the new tool, provides customers one card that can aggregate all of their existing Mastercard and Visa Inc (V.N)  payment cards. Users can carry only the Curve card and switch between the cards they want to use for a purchase through a mobile phone app.  Founded in 2015, the startup is among a growing group of young companies that seek to make better use of digital technologies to make payments and banking products more user-friendly. The startup’s chief executive, Shachar Bialick, said the new “time travel” functionality will give customers more time to chose the most convenient form of payment for a given transaction.  For example, users might have funds available in their current account days after a purchase paid for with a credit card - and would therefore prefer to switch the transaction to a debit card to avoid interest fees.  “The user can manage their cash flow much better,” Bialick said. “It’s very hard to make the decision at the point of sale.” The functionality would also enable users to take better advantage of card rewards, he said. While users would be able to switch cards, the change would happen within Curve’s platform, so merchants would only see the original transaction and would not be charged card processing fees twice.  Rewards gained through the first purchase will be reversed if that card is changed, Curve said.    Curve, which is still in “beta” testing mode, has already had more than 50,000 sign-ups, with the cards having been used for over 50 million pounds ($64.7 million) in transactions so far. It plans to fully launch this year.  (1 pound = $1.29) ",7032017,http://www.reuters.com/article/payments-curve/uk-startup-curve-launches-financial-time-travel-idUSL1N1JU0YR
549,MA,Visa and Mastercard potential suitors for Denmark's Nets: analysts,"(Reuters) - Visa (V.N) and Mastercard (MA.N) are both seen as suitors for Danish card payment services company Nets A/S NETS.CO, which confirmed over the weekend it had been approached by potential buyers. Analysts at Morgan Stanley and Nordea Equity Research both said the U.S. giants could be interested in Scandinavia’s largest payments processor, which had a market capitalization of 26 billion crowns ($4 billion) at Friday’s close. “Nets can confirm that it has been approached and is reviewing its options. However, it is very early stage and there can be no certainty as to the potential outcome,” the company said in a statement on Saturday. Shares in Nets jumped as much as 14 percent on Monday following the statement which came after Bloomberg reported that potential buyers, including U.S. private equity firm Hellman & Friedman LLC, were interested.  “We believe interest from pure acquiring companies is less likely. The U.S. payment schemes (Visa & Mastercard) are clearly large enough to be able to acquire a company the size of Nets,” Morgan Stanley analysts write in a research note. Nordea Equity Research analyst Oliver Schüler Pisani said Visa and Mastercard could be potential bidders for Nets, the issuer of the most used debit card in Denmark, Dankort. Analysts said Nets’s valuation was attractive. It trades at a discount to both the sector and its closest rival, Worldplay WPG.L, leaving room for a good takeover premium, Pisani said. Nets trades at a 12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 14.6 compared with 21.3 for Worldpay Group and 24.6 for Worldline (WLN.PA). Shares in Worldpay rose 1.4 percent on Monday while Worldline was 1.8 percent higher.

555,MA,Court blocks $18 billion British class action against MasterCard,"LONDON (Reuters) - A 14 billion pound ($18 billion) class action lawsuit against MasterCard for allegedly overcharging more than 45 million people in Britain over a 16-year period was blocked by a British court on Friday. The Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), a newly-empowered court that oversees Britain’s fledgling class action regime, ruled that it would not grant the necessary collective proceedings order for the case to proceed to trial. Had it been allowed to proceed, the case would have been the largest and most complex in British legal history and would have tested the limits of the new Consumer Rights Act, which introduced U.S.-style “opt-out” collective class actions for breaches of UK or European Union competition law in 2015. MasterCard welcomed the judgment, saying the claim was “completely unsuitable” to be brought under the collective action regime. Law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan launched the case on behalf of adults in Britain after MasterCard lost a drawn-out appeal against a 2007 European Commission decision that ruled its fees were anti-competitive. The case centered on so-called interchange fees, the charges levied by credit and debit card companies such as Mastercard on merchants’ banks, which card companies say cover the costs of operating card services, security and innovation. It alleged these fees were a significant cost for retailers and were passed on through increased prices of goods and services to all UK consumers, including those who paid in cash and not just MasterCard holders. London-based Walter Merricks, a lawyer who once led the Financial Ombudsman Service group that handles consumer disputes with banks and who is the representative named on the proposed action, said he was considering an appeal with his advisers. “The new collective action regime was introduced by the Consumer Rights Act to overcome the difficulty for consumers seeking to recover losses from competition law infringements,” he said. “I am concerned that this new regime, designed to benefit consumers, may never get off the ground.” He added that concerns cited by the tribunal, which included the difficulties in providing evidence that MasterCard fees were passed on to consumers and in precisely calculating individual losses for so many consumers, could have been overcome. The planned lawsuit had been dubbed by one lawyer the “perfect exam question” for Britain’s CAT, nominated in 2015 to oversees the country’s maiden “opt-out” class action lawsuits in antitrust cases.  Under the regime, UK-based members of a defined group are automatically bound into legal action unless they opt out.  Critics say such regimes encourage claims without merit. But others argue they are designed to offer a more effective and economic route to compensation for UK-based consumers and businesses who fall victim to anti-competitive conduct and saves on hefty advertising costs to rally a large group together. London’s High Court ruled in January that MasterCard had charged interchange fees at a lawful level and without restricting competition in a similar dispute with retailers.

561,MA,Mastercard beats profit estimates on higher consumer spending,"(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc (MA.N), the world’s second-biggest payments processor, joined bigger rival Visa Inc (V.N) on Thursday in reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit as people spent more using credit and debit cards. Consumer spending in the United States, which accounts for more than two-thirds of nationwide economic activity, has been on an upswing, supported by a tightening labor market and cooling inflation. Purchase, New York-based Mastercard, like its bigger rival Visa Inc (V.N), generates revenue by facilitating credit- and debit-card transactions and both their revenue streams are closely linked to consumer spending power. Mastercard also benefited from consumer spending outside the United States, with its cross-border volumes — the value of transactions made by overseas card-holders — rising 14 percent on a local currency basis in the second quarter ended June 30. Shares of Mastercard were, however, down 1.4 percent after the company said it expected third-quarter revenue growth to mirror the second quarter’s 13.3 percent rise. The forecast probably disappointed investors who were expecting an increase to Mastercard’s full-year expectations, said Bernstein analyst Lisa Ellis. Fears of a potential slowdown in the company’s business in the second half of the year could have dragged down the company’s stock, Ellis added. Mastercard’s total revenue climbed to $3.05 billion in the second quarter, driven in part by its acquisition of digital payments company Vocalink. “(Vocalink’s) the area that investors are becoming increasingly excited about,” Ellis said. Mastercard has also spent heavily on developing and marketing its Masterpass e-wallet. The company expects to increase advertising and marketing spending by about $35 million in the third quarter, Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said on a call with analysts. Hund-Mejean also said operating expenses would increase in the high single percentage digits on an adjusted, currency-neutral basis in the third quarter. Mastercard's net income rose to $1.18 billion, or $1.10 per share in the second quarter, from $983 million, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier. mstr.cd/2vMmERM Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.04 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

573,MA,"UPDATE 3-PayPal tops profit estimates, lifts target on mobile payments growth","(Reuters) - Sharp growth in mobile payments led PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL.O) to report a better-than-expected third-quarter profit on Thursday and lift its guidance for earnings through the rest of the year. The San Jose, California-based payments company has been working hard in recent years to expand its reach to new customers through partnerships and acquisitions, particularly in mobile payments. Those deals are clearly starting to bear fruit, analysts said. “It was just a very strong quarter across the board,” said A.B. Mendez, an analyst and fund manager at Frost Investment Advisors. PayPal shares were up 3.9 percent at $69.89 in after-hours trading following the results. Since separating from online marketplace eBay Inc (EBAY.O) in 2015, PayPal has reshaped itself from a company that mostly processed transactions for its parent to a payments giant that handles money transfers between other companies and customers, as well as friends, roommates, overseas relatives and small businesses. It has partnered with household names like Mastercard Inc (MA.N), Visa Inc (V.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Alphabet Inc’s (GOOG.O) Google, Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Skype, and acquired startups like online lender Swift Financial and remittances company Xoom. It also owns Venmo, the mobile payments app that is popular with young adults, and still handles transactions for eBay. In a call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman characterized the third quarter as possibly the best since its split from eBay and said PayPal is on the hunt for more acquisitions. “We have very strong balance sheet, and it’s a potential weapon for us as we think about competing going forward,” he said. The company’s adjusted profit rose 32 percent during the third quarter to $560 million, or 46 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 43 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 21.4 percent to $3.24 billion. PayPal lifted its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to a range of $1.86 to $1.88 per share from $1.80 per share to $1.84 per share. It expects 50 cents to 52 cents per share in earnings during the fourth quarter, compared with an average analyst estimate of 51 cents. Much of the gains have come from PayPal’s aggressive effort to pick up market share in the fast-growing mobile payments space. Its mobile payments volume jumped 54 percent during the third quarter compared with the year-ago period, to about $40 billion. Total payments volume rose 31 percent to $114 billion. Venmo, which allows individuals in the United States to send each other money through a mobile app, more than doubled its payments volumes. Earlier this week, PayPal said it would soon allow more than 2 million merchant customers to start accepting payments through the platform.

577,MA,Mastercard posts record profit on higher global spending,"(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc (MA.N) on Tuesday posted a record profit and trounced Wall Street expectations, as it battled for consumers and global market share over other payment channels including its bigger rival Visa Inc (V.N).  More people used credit, debit and commercial prepaid cards across Mastercard’s global network - pushing the value of transactions processed - known as ‘gross dollar volume’, up 11 percent to $1.35 trillion.   “In the U.S., we continue to see steady economic growth, low unemployment and inflation,” said Ajay Banga, chief executive officer of Mastercard, on a post-earnings call. “Consumer sentiment is favourable.” Last month, consumer spending in the United States had its largest increase in eight years, aiding payment processors such as Mastercard and Visa, which generate revenue by facilitating credit- and debit-card transactions. Visa also beat market expectations last week, posting an 11 percent rise in quarterly profit on healthy consumer spending. Mastercard shares hit a record earlier but lost ground and were down 1.3 percent at $147.02 mid-day. The drop was  attributed to profit taking after a 20 percent rise from the previous quarter, according to Thomas McCrohan, managing director of Americas Research at Mizuho. Mastercard has risen nearly 44 percent this year, as of Monday’s close, outpacing Visa, which was up 41 percent over the same period. Mastercard's net income rose 21 percent to $1.43 billion or $1.34 per share in the third quarter ended Sept 30. Analysts on average were looking for $1.23, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  mstr.cd/2gYxlhy Cowen analyst George Mihalos called the results “very strong” and said the company has “exceeded our expectations every quarter this year.” Mastercard is taking measures to bolster security on its network and said safety remains a key priority. Many American companies are investing heavily in securing their systems against hackers. “Our investments in technologies like biometrics, tokens, encryption and artificial intelligence are redefining the way both consumers and transactions are protected,” Banga said. Mastercard has already started the process when it announced this month it would forgo signatures after purchases. Total operating expenses rose 20.4 percent to $1.46 billion in the quarter, partly from costs related to buying digital payments company Vocalink.

592,MA,Weaker estimates cast shadow over Visa's profit beat,"(Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, joining smaller rival Mastercard, as a solid holiday shopping season boosted transactions on its payment network. However, shares fell 1.52 percent in extended trading as Visa sees higher full-year expenses and slower revenue growth in the current quarter. “Our outlook for the fiscal second quarter net revenue growth remains a couple of points below the full year rate,” Chief Financial Officer Vasant Prabhu added. Net income rose to $2.52 billion in the first quarter ended Dec. 31 from $2.07 billion a year earlier, while earnings per Class A share rose to $1.07 from 86 cents.   The payment processor recorded a gain of $1.13 billion related to the new U.S. tax law and a charge of $1.15 billion tied to the repatriation of funds held overseas. Excluding items, Visa earned $1.08 per share. Analysts on average expected 99 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total operating revenue rose 9 percent to $4.86 billion, reflecting growth in payments volume and processed transactions. Operating expenses rose 12.8 percent to $1.54 billion and Visa said it expects expenses to rise in the second quarter as well. Payment volumes rose about 10 percent to $1.93 trillion, on a constant dollar basis, with the United States accounting for about 43.3 percent of the total. Cross-border volumes – the value of transactions made outside of the United States – increased 9 percent, on a similar measure. Visa said it would repurchase $7.5 billion of its stock and it has $9.1 billion of funds available for share buybacks.

594,MA,Holiday cheer lifts Mastercard's profit above Street,"(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc’s (MA.N) quarterly profit topped estimates on Thursday, boosted by a busy holiday shopping period that saw more people swiping credit and debit cards for larger sums. The company’s shares rose 4.4 percent to an all-time of $176.52. Growth in the U.S. economy over the last quarter also helped the world’s No. 2 payments network, which, like bigger rival Visa Inc (V.N) largely banks on the health of the economy and customers’ willingness to loosen purse strings in order to generate revenue from credit- and debit-card transactions. U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the country’s economic activity, accelerated at a 3.8 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter, the fastest in three years, as household incomes continued inching up. Outside the United States too, Mastercard has a strong presence. Cross-border volumes - the value of transactions made by overseas cardholders - rose 22.4 percent on a U.S. dollar-converted basis in the fourth quarter. Europe, and the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region accounted for majority of the cross-border volumes, Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean said. Around 1 percent point growth in overseas volumes came from “cardholders funding accounts and cryptocurrency exchanges, which was then used to purchase digital currencies”, Hund-Mejean said on a post-earnings call with analysts. Gross dollar volume - the value of transactions processed - was the highest in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, and superseded that in the United States. In APMEA, the value of transactions processed came in at $435 billion, versus $423 billion in the United States alone. “Payment volumes (for Mastercard) will stay healthy, we think, and a more sustained global economic recovery could eventually lead to an acceleration of spending and further revenue growth,” CFRA analyst Scott Kessler wrote in a note. Net income fell 76 percent to $227 million, or 21 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, as the company booked $981 million in charges, primarily due to the U.S. tax reform. (mstr.cd/2nwXaUZ) Excluding items, Mastercard earned $1.14 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.12, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

596,MA,EBay investors cheer move to ditch PayPal as main payments partner,"(Reuters) - Shares of eBay (EBAY.O) hit an all-time high on Thursday after the e-commerce platform unveiled a plan to take more control of customer payments from long-standing partner PayPal, a move analysts said would help it compete better with Amazon. Dutch fintech company Adyen will become eBay’s primary payments processor under the plan, which seeks to have more transactions conducted directly on eBay’s sites. Analysts said that might bring in more revenue for eBay while lowering costs, adding to optimism from a strong holiday quarter for the e-commerce company. “Moving away from PayPal (PYPL.O), lowering the costs of selling products on the marketplace makes eBay a more significant competitor because it lowers the relative cost versus others including Amazon (AMZN.O),” said D.A. Davidson & Co’s analyst Tom Forte. EBay is adapting to the likes of online crafts retailer Etsy Inc’s (ETSY.O) model by taking control of the payment process on its marketplaces from PayPal, Forte added. “But to be clear, there will always be a place for PayPal on eBay — it just will be less prominent,” said Forte. Some analysts said they were surprised by eBay’s estimate of the benefits from taking payments intermediary service in-house. The company said it would add $500 million to operating profit after the PayPal deal expires in mid-2020. Transactions through eBay account for roughly 13 percent of total payments processed by PayPal, whose shares sank more than 8 percent in response on Thursday. PayPal might be able to fill the hole created by eBay thanks to its strong growth rate, although that is not certain at this point, BTIG analyst Mark Palmer said. EBay’s backing for Adyen could turn the smaller payment processor into a “much more robust competitor” to PayPal over time, Palmer added. Other analysts, however, said PayPal, which has been eBay’s preferred provider for the past 15 years and will remain a payment page option on the platform for the foreseeable future, had the scale to ride out the blow. “Over time, given the recent agreements with Visa (V.N) and MasterCard (MA.N), PayPal will be able to scale and expand margins,” Wedbush Securities analysts said in a client note. At least 13 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on eBay’s shares. EBay’s stock climbed 15 percent on Thursday, recording its biggest one-day gain since 1998, the year of its market debut.

616,MA,Mastercard tops profit estimates on higher consumer spending,"(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc (MA.N) topped quarterly profit estimates on Wednesday and raised its full-year revenue forecast, as it gained from higher consumer spending on credit and debit cards globally. The company’s total gross dollar volume rose more than 19 percent to about $1.42 trillion in the first quarter, of which about 30 percent were transactions processed in the United States. U.S. consumer spending got a boost from rising wages, which hit their highest levels in 11 years, as companies passed on gains from tax cuts to their employees and job market improved. Bigger rival Visa also posted a quarterly profit well above analysts’ estimates last week. Both Mastercard and Visa continued to reap the benefits of consumers using their cards for offshore spending.  Mastercard’s cross-border volumes, or transactions made by overseas cardholders, rose 31.8 percent in the quarter when converted to dollars. “Mastercard’s quarter exceeded expectations as the company rides the wave of a strong global consumer,” said Gil Luria, director of research at D.A. Davidson. The Purchase, New York-based company also raised its 2018 growth forecast for adjusted net revenue to high-teens from mid-teens and adjusted operating expenses to mid-teens from low-double digits. Net income rose to $1.49 billion, or $1.41 per share, in the latest quarter ended March 31 from $1.08 billion, or $1 per share, a year earlier.

Shares of the company rose 2.5 percent to $184.69 in morning trading.     Through Tuesday’s close, Mastercard’s stock had climbed 19 percent so far this year, outperforming Visa’s 12 percent gain.
