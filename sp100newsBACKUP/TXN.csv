1,TXN,Freescale names TI's Lowe as CEO,"(Reuters) - Chip maker Freescale Semiconductor Holdings Ltd named Gregg Lowe, a long-time executive of rival Texas Instruments Inc, as its new CEO, sending Freescale shares up 8 percent. Lowe, who joined Texas Instruments in 1984 and most recently headed analog semiconductors - a key business for TI, will succeed Rich Beyer, who has headed Freescale for four years. Analysts said that the hire was good news for Freescale, which is seen benefiting from Lowe’s customer relationships as well as his management experience. “In our view, Mr. Lowe is a very strong hire, having managed the Analog division at TXN, which accounts for (about 15 percent) worldwide market share, representing the leadership position in the analog market,” said RBC analyst Doug Freedman. Another analyst, Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein, said Lowe’s experience with the U.S. and European automotive industry, where he focused at the start of his TI career, will fit well with Freescale, which gains 40 percent of its revenue from chips used in the automotive industry. Like TI, Freescale sells chips for a wide range of products, including industrial equipment, cellphones and consumer products. Rasgon noted that Lowe had started his career at TI in the company’s U.S. and European automotive business, But Rasgon said that leading Freescale, which needs to de-leverage its balance sheet, will be “one of the more difficult jobs in semiconductors right now.” Freescale’s Beyer had said in April that he would retire. Beyer will continue to serve on Freescale’s board to ensure a smooth transition, the company said in a statement. Lowe will be succeeded at Texas Instruments by Senior Vice President Brian Crutcher, Texas Instruments said. Williams Financial Group analyst Cody Acree said Lowe’s departure would be bad news for TI but he noted that the company is left with a very strong management team. “To the extent Gregg can make Freescale stronger and a better competitor that means TI has to work that much harder to maintain their market share gains,” Acree said. Freescale shares were up 70 cents or 8 percent to $9.44 in afternoon trade on New York Stock Exchange. TI shares were up 11 cents, or 0.4 percent at $27.20, on Nasdaq.

3,TXN,Texas Instruments narrows Q2 financial forecast,"(Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) on Monday narrowed its forecasts for second-quarter earnings and revenue, but kept the midpoints of its target ranges intact as demand for its chips held up, despite global economic uncertainties. The maker of chips for a wide variety of products, including cellphones and industrial equipment, forecast revenue in a range of $3.28 billion to $3.42 billion. It previously estimated revenue of $3.22 billion to $3.48 billion. It now expects earnings per share in a range of 32 cents to 36 cents. Its previous target was 30 cents to 38 cents. TI had said in April that it expected second quarter revenue growth due to a broad-based improvement in demand after several quarters when its clients had cut inventories. “To date this quarter is tracking generally consistent to April when we gave our guidance,” Ron Slaymaker, TI’s head of investor relations told analysts on a conference call. Some investors were relieved that TI managed to maintain its outlook despite concerns about disappointing economic indicators and weak information technology spending. “People worried that maybe they could reduce their guidance because of the global macro environment and slow (personal computer) sales,” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Bobby Burleson. Another analyst, Ed Snyder of Charter Equity Research, said that “meeting what you said you’d do in these tumultuous times is probably pretty good.” Slaymaker said that growth in the quarter was led by the United States followed by Asia and Europe and that Japan was the only country where it had seen a decline so far. The executive said that while business was improving in the industrial market, “visibility there continues to remain low.” He pointed to “notable strength” in communications infrastructure. TI shares initially rose as much as 1.4 percent to $28.04 in after-hours trade after closing down 3 percent at $27.65 on Nasdaq.

6,TXN,TI sees thirs-quarter revenue hurt by weak orders,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc’s second-quarter profit beat Wall Street expectations but the company warned that its third-quarter revenue would be weaker than usual for this time of year as customers are cautious due to global economic uncertainties. Shares of TI, which makes chips for a wide range of products such as cellphones and industrial equipment, fell 1 percent in extended trade after it said Monday that orders weakened in June and that its backlog for shipments due in September is also lighter than expected. Company executives said TI’s customers and distributors are “increasingly cautious in placing new orders” because of the global economic environment even though they have low stockpiles of chips. Analysts said that the slowdown was not surprising as TI is the latest in a long line of chip companies including Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc to lower financial targets this quarter. Because TI’s customers are seeing lethargic demand from consumers and corporations, they are not ordering very far in advance, Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree said. “End demand is not strong enough that anybody’s afraid of losing out on market share if they don’t carry inventory, so the entire manufacturing food chain is relying on very short delivery times,” Acree said. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said TI is perhaps being a little cautious about September itself since it said that “order patterns for July and August (were) fairly normal.” TI forecast third quarter revenue of $3.21 billion to $3.47 billion, implying a midpoint that is flat with its second quarter revenue. This compares with TI’s 5-year average for third quarter sequential growth of 6 percent. Chief Financial Officer Kevin said it was not clear whether customers were anticipating a slowdown in their own business or taking advantage of TI’s ability to deliver chips relatively quickly because it has high inventory levels. “It’s a little different to draw a concrete conclusion but what we do know is that it’s unusual,” March told Reuters. “As we look at our customers our opinion is that their inventories are very lean. That tells us that if in fact we’ve normal seasonal demand, it’s a good thing we’ve built a lot of inventory,” he said. TI reported earnings of $446 million, or 38 cents per share, down from $672 million, or 56 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding certain items, it earned 44 cents per share, above Wall Street expectations for 41 cents according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell to $3.34 billion from $3.46 billion, compared with analysts’ average expectation for $3.35 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. TI shares fell to $26.60 after closing at $26.82 on Nasdaq. The stock had already fallen about 16 percent since the company’s last quarterly report on April 23 as investors worried about slowing chip demand.

7,TXN,"US STOCKS-Pain in Spain hits Wall St, Texas Instruments off late","* McDonald’s stock drops after earnings disappointment * Second Spanish region may seek bailout, more may follow * Euro hits 2-year low vs dollar, near 12-year low vs. yen * Dow off 0.8 pct, S&P; off 0.9 pct, Nasdaq off 1.2 pct By Ryan Vlastelica NEW YORK, July 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell for a second straight session on Monday, as Spain appeared closer to needing a national bailout and poor corporate results weighed on the market. Weak results from McDonald’s Corp added to the cautious tone on Wall Street. Materials stocks were among the day’s weakest, hurt by across-the-board declines in commodity prices. Still, stocks ended well off the day’s lows, rebounding from their initial plunge. Stocks appeared to stabilize as the S&P; 500 approached its 50-day moving average of 1,332.98, a technical support level that could trigger more losses if convincingly broken. Overall, three stocks fell for every one that rose on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, a signal that the afternoon rebound was concentrated among larger-cap shares. On the Nasdaq, about four stocks fell for every one that rose. “The sell-off this morning was overdone, and obviously, the market felt that way, too,” said Eric Green, senior portfolio manager and director of research at Penn Capital Management in Philadelphia, which oversees $6.5 billion. “Nothing incrementally negative came out, but obviously, we’re still worried about the situation there.” The Spanish region of Murcia looked set to follow Valencia in tapping a government program to keep its finances afloat. Local media reported half a dozen regions were ready to follow suit. Valencia’s move contributed to a 1 percent drop in the S&P; 500 on Friday. The benchmark index had appeared on track to exceed those losses on Monday, falling as much as 1.8 percent before recovering some of those losses. The International Monetary Fund dismissed a weekend news report in German weekly Der Spiegel that it may refuse to continue supporting Greece as it prepares for talks with the new Greek government on its international bailout. McDonald’s Corp was the latest earnings casualty among large multinational companies after posting a lower-than-expected profit, citing a slower global economy and a stronger dollar. McDonald’s stock slid 2.9 percent to $88.94. It was the biggest drag on the Dow. Shares of Wendy’s Co  fell 2.4 percent to $4.51. After the closing bell, Texas Instruments Inc shares dropped 1.4 percent to $26.44 in extended trading following the company’s results. Texas Instruments reported a drop in its second-quarter profit and sales. With 23 percent of S&P; 500 companies having reported results, 67.5 percent have posted earnings above expectations, although many analysts have cut their forecasts in recent weeks, allowing for easier beats. Over the past four quarters, 68 percent of companies beat estimates. The high-profile earnings disappointments have taken a toll on third-quarter estimates. Third-quarter S&P; 500 earnings growth is now expected to come in at 0.9 percent, down from 3.1 percent at the beginning of the month. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 101.11 points, or 0.79 percent, to close at 12,721.46. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 12.14 points, or 0.89 percent, to 1,350.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 35.15 points, or 1.20 percent, to close at 2,890.15. At its session low, the Dow was down as much as 239.16 points, or 1.9 percent, at 12,583.41. The S&P; 500 fell as low as 1,337.56, down 25.1 points, or 1.8 percent, at its session low. The Nasdaq had touched a session low at 2,852.88, down 72.42 points, or 2.5 percent from Friday’s close. Energy shares slumped as fears of a global slowdown prompted investors to sell oil as U.S. crude fell 3.8 percent. Chevron Corp dropped 1.1 percent to $107.95. The NYSE Arca oil index lost 1.7 percent. The CBOE Volatility Index jumped 14.4 percent to 18.62 at the close. According to the VIX Open Interest Put-to-Call ratio, VIX options traders are holding only 50 puts for every 100 calls outstanding on the VIX. The last time this ratio hit this level was early August of 2011, just before a huge volatility spike that lasted nearly four months, he said. The euro slid to a two-year low against the dollar and a near 12-year trough against the yen, pressured by fears that Spain may eventually need a full sovereign bailout. The yield on the Spanish 10-year bond was last at 7.496 percent, well over what analysts consider a sustainable level. Peet’s Coffee & Tea Inc soared 27.8 percent to $73.05 after striking a deal to be acquired by Joh. A. Benckiser for about $1 billion.

13,TXN,Analysis: Texas Instruments investors want wireless pull back,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shareholders of Texas Instruments, once the cellphone chip leader, want the company to reduce its money-losing investment in wireless or even exit the market. TI, which makes chips for products as diverse as phones and cars, is already winding down its development of baseband chips that connect mobile phones to cellular networks. That process is expected to be completed by the end of 2012. Now analysts want TI to take similar action with its two remaining wireless businesses: its OMAP application processors, which support mobile features like video and gaming, and its wireless connectivity chips, which include short-range technologies such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. “I think most investors would like them to do something with it before it turns into baseband,” said Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon, who questioned whether TI could have made money from exiting baseband if it had acted sooner. “Having the wireless business is hurting the stock,” said Rasgon who sees the business as a distraction from the analog business, where TI is the market leader. TI shares are down almost 13 percent since late March. Like Rasgon, some TI investors want the company to focus its efforts on its more promising analog and embedded chip business. Rasgon would like TI to either restructure or sell wireless. While there is no obvious buyer, he said that phone makers such as LG Electronics or Huawei Technologies Co could potentially take a look at the assets. TI posted an operating loss for its wireless business in the first and second quarters, exacerbating investor worries about wireless, which accounts for about 10 percent of TI’s revenue. “If we don’t see appreciable growth in the next year or so you’ll probably see them pulling out,” said Charter Equity Research analyst Ed Snyder. RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman said he sees TI slowing down wireless spending. “Ultimately they’re going to have to take an action to lower the investment level,” he said. Qualcomm Inc took TI’s leadership position in cellphone chips sales in the fourth quarter of 2007 and has remained there ever since, according research firm IHS iSuppli. Besides Qualcomm, Dallas-based TI also faces intense competition in application processors from newer rivals Broadcom Corp, Intel Corp and Nvidia Corp. Perhaps more importantly, the leading smartphone makers Samsung Electronics and Apple Inc have been developing their own wireless chips. Even smaller cellphone maker Huawei is now developing its own chips. While Samsung still buys some TI chips, analysts worry that TI’s prospects at the South Korean company have diminished. The increased competition TI faces has been compounded by the issues facing two of its key customers: Nokia and Research In Motion, which have been losing ground in smartphones. Unlike Qualcomm, which has done well with integrated products that combine a baseband and application processor, TI has bet that there would be a big enough market for dedicated application processors apart in high-end smartphones. But analysts have long questioned TI on this bet. Josh Spencer, portfolio manager for T. Rowe Price, worries whether the market for stand-alone chips going forward will be big enough “to justify the investment.” TI’s wireless connectivity business, which includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips, also faces cut-throat competition from Broadcom, Qualcomm and others. Spencer said TI should have already made a decision about the future of its connectivity business, and sees it as an “even tougher story (than OMAP) with virtually no overlap with the rest of the business.” As of March 31, T. Rowe Price listed ownership of 32 million TI shares as well as shares in Qualcomm and Broadcom. At the end of June it had $541.7 billion in assets under management. In an effort to offset its challenges in smartphones, TI now sells its OMAP application processors in other markets. For instance, the company is targeting industrial customers such as car makers, according to Avner Goren, TI’s general manager for OMAP. “The best thing we can do is to leverage the investment we’re making in OMAP in multiple markets. The return is bigger, and over a longer period of time,” said Goren, noting that products like cars have a longer lifespan than phones. But even as investors say they are happy about the prospect of TI generating new sources of OMAP revenue, they worry that this strategy could lead to more hefty OMAP investments. Goren declined to comment on the company’s future investments beyond saying that wireless is still important. Even if TI fails to make a big strategy change soon, Dan Fletcher, a managing director at TI shareholder Neuberger Berman, sees market changes sealing its fate in wireless. Neuberger Berman, which had $194 billion assets under management as of June 30, held 7.6 million TI shares at the end of March. “They need to recognize the market opportunity is not as big going forward as it has been,” Fletcher said. “They can probably milk what they have for a while but ultimately it’s going to get harder and harder.” ",8132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-texasinstruments-wireless-winddown/analysis-texas-instruments-investors-want-wireless-pull-back-idUSBRE87C0DV20120813
14,TXN,Nvidia's miss in Kindle Fire surprises some investors,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc’s decision to use a processor made by Texas Instruments Inc for its newest Kindle Fire tablets has surprised some investors and experts who thought Nvidia Inc’s Tegra 3 chip would be tapped for the high-profile device. At an event in Santa Monica, California on Thursday, Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said TI’s OMAP 4470 chip is being used in the new, higher-end Kindle Fire. He showed reporters graphs suggesting the OMAP chip has better bandwidth and computing power than Nvidia’s top mobile component. “This is a huge surprise,” said Evercore analyst Patrick Wang. “Most people assumed Tegra 3 would be the processor in the new device.” Shares of Nvidia trimmed gains after Amazon announced the tablets. The stock was still up 2.85 percent at $13.70, in line with broad gains in tech stocks. TI’s shares were up 3.65 percent at $29.56. The first Kindle Fire, launched last year, also used a TI processor, giving TI a foot in the door with Amazon.

15,TXN,Nvidia's miss in Kindle Fire surprises some investors,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc’s  decision to use a processor made by Texas Instruments Inc  for its newest Kindle Fire tablets has surprised some investors and experts who thought Nvidia Inc’s Tegra 3 chip would be tapped for the high-profile device. At an event in Santa Monica, California on Thursday, Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said TI’s OMAP 4470 chip is being used in the new, higher-end Kindle Fire. He showed reporters graphs suggesting the OMAP chip has better bandwidth and computing power than Nvidia’s top mobile component. “This is a huge surprise,” said Evercore analyst Patrick Wang. “Most people assumed Tegra 3 would be the processor in the new device.” Shares of Nvidia trimmed gains after Amazon announced the tablets. The stock was still up 2.85 percent at $13.70, in line with broad gains in tech stocks. TI’s shares were up 3.65 percent at $29.56. The first Kindle Fire, launched last year, also used a TI processor, giving TI a foot in the door with Amazon.

16,TXN,UPDATE 3-Texas Instruments eyes shift away from wireless,"* Looks to shift to broader market than smartphones * Sees embedded processor growth slower but profitable * Sees embedded/wireless gross margins 55-60 pct * TI shares close down 3 pct By Sinead Carew Sept 25 (Reuters) - Texas Instruments said it will shift its wireless investment focus from products like smartphones to a broader market including industrial clients like carmakers where it is hoping for a more profitable and stable business. But TI’s shares fell more than 3 percent as investors worried about its revenue prospects because the chipmaker did not go into detail about how the change would affect its financial results at an investor meeting on Tuesday. Dallas, Texas-based TI has been under pressure in wireless, where it has lost ground to rival Qualcomm Inc and the world’s biggest smartphone makers Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd who have been developing their own chips instead of buying them from a supplier like TI. TI, whose chips are used in products such as Amazon.com’s  Kindle Fire tablet, told investors that it would continue to support its customers. But its mobile application chip business, which supports features like video, will not invest in supporting its customers future roadmap for tablets and smartphones to the same degree as before. “We believe that opportunity is less attractive as we go forward,” Greg Delagi, senior vice president for embedded processing, said during a webcast of the meeting. TI has already kicked off efforts to expand sales of its OMAP wireless application chips beyond smartphone and tablets to its embedded chip business, which include industrial customers such as carmakers. Analysts took Delagi’s comments as the strongest indication yet that TI might exit OMAP from smartphones and tablets entirely. “TI made it very clear they no longer want to be in the business of proving application processors for smartphones or tablets,” said Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney. “What remains uncertain is for how long they’ll support customers.” As a result, investors were left wondering when TI’s revenue from smartphones and tablets would start to disappear and how soon it would be able to replace it with new revenue generated from applying its previous investments to new markets. Delagi said that TI is “reprofiling” its investment in wireless for embedded customers and that the company’s research and development profile for OMAP “needs to look different.” The executive said OMAP’s growth in the embedded product market will be slower than in the high-growth wireless market but would “generate a more stable, profitable long-term business” than wireless. But he said it was too early to reveal specifics as to how this would affect TI’s financials as the company is still working on changing its business. In general Delagi said he expects TI’s embedded processor and wireless chips to generate gross margins in a range of 55 percent to 60 percent and operating margins of about 30 percent, but he declined to give a time frame. But this was not enough for investors. “The market never likes uncertainty, and while removing some they created more,” RBC analyst Doug Freedman said.

17,TXN,Texas Instruments eyes shift away from wireless,"(Reuters) - Texas Instruments said it is shifting its wireless investment focus from products like smartphones to a broader market that includes industrial customers like carmakers, but some investors were disappointed in the lack of details. TI shares were down 1.2 percent after Tuesday’s presentation to investors where participants tried to get more information about the future of its wireless business and what it will mean for TI’s workforce numbers and its revenues. “The market never likes uncertainty, and while removing some they created more,” RBC analyst Doug Freedman said. Dallas, Texas based TI has been under pressure from investors to pull back from wireless, where it has lost ground to rivals like Qualcomm Inc and to smartphone makers Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which are developing their own chips. “We believe that opportunity is less attractive as we go forward,” Greg Delagi, senior vice president for embedded processing, said during a webcast of a TI investor meeting.

21,TXN,Amazon in talks to buy TI mobile chip arm: paper,"(Reuters) - Amazon.Com Inc is in advanced talks to buy the supplier of processors for its Kindle tablet computer, Israeli financial newspaper Calcalist reported on Monday, a step toward vertical integration that could portend a push into smartphones. The report said any deal for the smartphone chip business of Texas Instruments Inc (TI) would probably be worth billions of dollars and could make Amazon, led by founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, a direct rival to Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which also design their own chips. Owning its own chip business could save Amazon money if it plans to sell larger quantities of mobile devices. It could also help Amazon design better products. “Look at Bezos and what he’s trying to build. I think he would consider himself of the Steve Jobs ilk,” said Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree. “If it works for Apple then why wouldn’t it work as well or better for Amazon?” TI’s processors, essentially the brains in computers, are used in Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablet. Bezos underlined TI’s strength in the industry at the tablet’s recent launch. For more than a year, speculation has swirled that Amazon could sell its own smartphone but the company has not publicly addressed those rumors. Texas Instruments has said it plans to move away from the increasingly competitive smartphone and tablet chip business, called OMAP, and Wall Street has speculated it could be sold. Amazon declined to comment on the report. TI said it does not comment on rumors but said in an email to Reuters on Monday, “The smartphone market has become a less attractive long-term opportunity for TI’s OMAP and connectivity products, and we are re-profiling our investment accordingly.” Apple designs the processors for its iPhones and iPads inhouse, alongside engineers working on the company’s operating system and other features. Analysts credit that vertical integration with part of the success of Apple’s mobile gadgets. Microsoft Corp agrees. In a break from its traditional business model of licensing operating systems to PC manufacturers, Microsoft this month will launch the Surface tablet, a tablet Microsoft designed itself. Some analysts questioned whether it would make sense for Amazon to get into the semiconductor business when many smaller and independent smartphone chip makers are struggling. Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi said she doubted whether Amazon wants to “become that intimately involved with hardware”. TI’s OMAP business will generate revenue of around $650 million this year, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore estimated. Based on that number, he wrote in a note to clients that the business could sell for $500 million to $700 million. Acree said a second, more difficult, way to value a potential deal could be based on a estimate of potential future sales volume of Amazon smartphones and tablets built with TI’s chips. TI said last month it would shift its wireless investment focus from products like smartphones to a broader market including industrial clients such as carmakers, where it is hoping for a more profitable and stable business.

28,TXN,Texas Instruments forecasts revenue below estimates,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc’s quarterly revenue fell as demand for its chips slipped on economic concerns, and the company forecast more weakness this quarter in all its customer segments. The U.S. chipmaker, which supplies companies ranging from computer makers to automakers, said its customers are ordering fewer chips than expected for this time of the year as they are nervous about weak end-market demand. The company cited a decline in orders for automotive customers in China and Europe and a lot of weakness in the computer industry including peripheral products like printers as well as slowing demand in wireless network equipment. “Across the board we’re seeing customers being extremely cautious, very careful about the level of inventory that they hold so giving us very low levels of visibility as to what they’ll want to order for the quarter,” Texas Instruments Chief Financial Officer Kevin March said in an interview on Monday. As a result, the company forecast a fourth quarter revenue range with a midpoint that implies a 13 percent decline from the third quarter, compared with a more typical decline of about 4 percent, March said. “What’s the most disappointing ... here is that this is the point in the cycle where we should be willing to build inventory,” RBC analyst Doug Freedman said. He noted that TI came out of a prolonged inventory correction only in the first half of this year. TI forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $2.83 billion to $3.07 billion, well below Wall Street expectations for $3.24 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. However, investors seemed to take the news in their stride after weak reports from smaller chip rivals such as Linear Technology and large chip companies such as Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. TI’s shares fell 0.3 percent in late trade to $27.70 after closing off 2 cents at $27.79 on Nasdaq. Because of the weaker demand TI told analysts on a conference call that it is slowing down production in its factories and that fourth quarter production will be below the third quarter. However, it declined to give details about how much capacity it is using in its factories. The chipmaker’s inability to fully utilize its factories has investors worried about its profitability going forward. “With the macroeconomic slowdown we’re experiencing, and TI’s excess capacity - they’re only using about 75 percent of their capacity right now - they’re going to be under some longer-term pressure to try to fill those fabs,” said JoAnne Feeney, an analyst at Longbow Research. TI’s third quarter profit rose to $784 million, or 67 cents per share, from $601 million, or 51 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue fell to $3.39 billion from $3.47 billion in the year-ago quarter slightly beat Wall Street expectations for $3.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. TI forecast fourth-quarter earnings of 23 to 31 cents per share, down from the third quarter.

We believe that program is well along to completion and do not expect that the termination of OMAP will disrupt those plans,” said Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney. Amazon had reportedly been in talks to buy the mobile part of OMAP. TI said it expects to take charges of about $325 million related to the job cuts and other cost reduction measures, most of which will be accounted for in the current quarter. Its previously announced financial targets for the fourth quarter do not include these costs, TI said. The company, which has 35,000 employees around the world, expects annualized savings of about $450 million by the end of 2013 from the action.

34,TXN,Texas Instruments slightly boosts a profit target,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) on Monday slightly improved a profit target, excluding a massive restructuring charge, as the company is cutting costs due to macro-economic uncertainties. While the company did not improve the mid-point of its revenue target, a key measure of demand for its chips, its non-GAAP earnings outlook was a penny better than expected. Investors initially took the change as a positive sign, but an after hours share gain soon disappeared after an executive spoke to analysts on a conference call. Investor relations executive Ron Slaymaker said that the penny difference was due to general tightening down on expenses where possible because of the weak economy. “I can’t see how you could read a recovery into what TI said,” Charter Equity Research analyst Ed Snyder said, noting that TI gave no indication that demand was going to get better or worse and that this would make its stock volatile. Adds analyst comment, executive “This isn’t going to give comfort to either the bulls or the bears because there’s no clear indication of a sustained long term trend up or down,” he said. Including a 21 cent per share restructuring charge, the chip maker forecast current-quarter earnings per share in a range of 5 to 9 cents. But excluding the restructuring charge, the new target implies a midpoint of 28 cents per share on a non-GAAP basis, compared with TI’s previous midpoint of 27 cents per share. The fourth-quarter charge relates to the company’s November announcement that it will cut 1,700 jobs as it moves out of the market for application chips in cell phones. TI forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $2.89 billion to $3.01 billion compared with its previous expectation for $2.83 billion to $3.07 billion. The latest guidance implies a midpoint of $2.95 billion and compares with Wall Street expectations for $2.96 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

37,TXN,Texas Instruments warns of weak demand,"(Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) on Tuesday posted quarterly revenue that was ahead of Wall Street expectations but the chip maker warned of uncertain demand and a widespread customer reluctance to order until the last minute due to macroeconomic worries. TI, which makes chips for everything from industrial equipment to cars, said that while orders appeared to be following a normal pace for this time of year, customers were worried about increasing their inventory of chips. Chief Financial Officer Kevin March told Reuters that quarterly revenue was at the high end of TI’s expected range because customers had made some orders late in the quarter. But he said that weakness in European economies and in China as well as uncertainty about government policies in the United States was making customers wary of ordering too many chips. “You’ve got the lingering uncertainty in Europe. You’ve got the slowdown in China that seems to be reversing itself now and you’ve got the (U.S.) fiscal cliff taking up all the headlines,” March told Reuters. “Combined, it’s got everybody really conservative right now and not willing to go out on a limb.” On top of this, the company’s previously announced wind down of its cellphone chip business will push revenue down much more than it otherwise would have fallen in the first quarter, March said. TI said its fourth-quarter profit fell to $264 million or 23 cents per share compared with $298 million or 25 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue fell to $2.98 billion from $3.42 billion but was ahead of Wall Street expectations for $2.95 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

50,TXN,"Texas Instruments raises its earnings, revenue target","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Texas Instruments (TXN.O) raised its targets for first-quarter earnings and revenue to the upper end of its previous forecast ranges, due to improving demand for its chips in an industry that has been hit for several quarters by a weak global economy. TI, a maker of chips for a wide array of products ranging from computers to industrial equipment, said on Thursday that chip orders were increasing and that it expects the trend to continue. While Ron Slaymaker, head of investor relations, said that TI was still seeing weakness in sales of chips for notebook computers and communications infrastructure, he cited a noted improvement in orders from TI’s industrial customers and better-than-expected wireless chip sales. Overall, Slaymaker said TI’s chip order backlog was growing for the first time in several quarters, and that it appeared to come from improving demand from end-users rather than chip inventory restocking at its customers. “We’re clearly expecting growth in the second quarter,” Slaymaker told analysts on a conference call. TI executives had spoken in bleaker tones after their quarterly earnings report in January, citing customer wariness about over ordering due to economic weakness in Europe and China and uncertainty about U.S. government policies. However, analysts were cautious about celebrating and TI’s shares fell slightly in late trade. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said TI’s comments about strength in its industrial business were encouraging as was its suggestion of improving customer demand that was unrelated to changes in chip inventory levels. “Those are good things and indicative that maybe things are getting better,” he said but added that it was not necessarily a sign of a strong recovery for the broader semiconductor market. “I’m not ready to jump on the economic recovery bandwagon yet,” Rasgon said. “It’s modestly encouraging.” Freescale Semiconductor Ltd FSL.N, a maker of chips for cars and machinery, had also forecast current quarter revenue that was better than expected in late January citing improvements in its wireless and enterprise business. While demand for chips used in tablets and handsets was better than expected, Slaymaker noted that the company’s revenue from wireless would still decline in the first quarter as TI is gradually shutting down its wireless chip business. TI said it now expects first quarter earnings per share of 28 to 32 cents, compared with its previous target range of 24 to 32 cents and implying a new midpoint of 30 cents compared with 28 cents. It forecast revenue in a range of $2.80 billion to $2.91 billion, which compared with its January forecast for a range of $2.69 billion to $2.91 billion. The $2.855 billion midpoint of the updated revenue range was above Wall Street expectations for $2.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree said that the industry was likely in the early stages of a broader improvement. “While market signals continue to be mixed, we do believe TI is one of the best vehicles for investors to participate in what we believe to be the early stages of an improving semiconductor cycle,” Acree said in a research note. TI shares were down slightly at $35.11 in after hours trade after closing at $35.20 in the regular Nasdaq session. The stock has risen 5 percent since January 22 as investors have been betting on an improvement in demand for TI.

TI, a maker of chips for a wide array of products ranging from computers to industrial equipment, said on Thursday that chip orders were increasing and that it expects the trend to continue. While Ron Slaymaker, head of investor relations, said that TI was still seeing weakness in sales of chips for notebook computers and communications infrastructure, he cited a noted improvement in orders from TI’s industrial customers and better-than-expected wireless chip sales. Overall, Slaymaker said TI’s chip order backlog was growing for the first time in several quarters, and that it appeared to come from improving demand from end-users rather than chip inventory restocking at its customers. “We’re clearly expecting growth in the second quarter,” Slaymaker told analysts on a conference call. TI executives had spoken in bleaker tones after their quarterly earnings report in January, citing customer wariness about over ordering due to economic weakness in Europe and China and uncertainty about U.S. government policies. However, analysts were cautious about celebrating and TI’s shares fell slightly in late trade. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said TI’s comments about strength in its industrial business were encouraging as was its suggestion of improving customer demand that was unrelated to changes in chip inventory levels. “Those are good things and indicative that maybe things are getting better,” he said but added that it was not necessarily a sign of a strong recovery for the broader semiconductor market. “I’m not ready to jump on the economic recovery bandwagon yet,” Rasgon said. “It’s modestly encouraging.” Freescale Semiconductor Ltd, a maker of chips for cars and machinery, had also forecast current quarter revenue that was better than expected in late January citing improvements in its wireless and enterprise business. While demand for chips used in tablets and handsets was better than expected, Slaymaker noted that the company’s revenue from wireless would still decline in the first quarter as TI is gradually shutting down its wireless chip business. TI said it now expects first quarter earnings per share of 28 to 32 cents, compared with its previous target range of 24 to 32 cents and implying a new midpoint of 30 cents compared with 28 cents. It forecast revenue in a range of $2.80 billion to $2.91 billion, which compared with its January forecast for a range of $2.69 billion to $2.91 billion. The $2.855 billion midpoint of the updated revenue range was above Wall Street expectations for $2.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree said that the industry was likely in the early stages of a broader improvement. “While market signals continue to be mixed, we do believe TI is one of the best vehicles for investors to participate in what we believe to be the early stages of an improving semiconductor cycle,” Acree said in a research note. TI shares were down slightly at $35.11 in after hours trade after closing at $35.20 in the regular Nasdaq session. The stock has risen 5 percent since Jan. 22 as investors have been betting on an improvement in demand for TI.",3082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/texasinstruments-forecast/update-2-texas-instruments-raises-its-earnings-revenue-target-idUSL1N0BZHZB20130308

53,TXN,UPDATE 3-Texas Instruments sees improved but cautious demand,"By Noel Randewich and Sinead Carew April 22 (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc posted first-quarter results slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations and it forecast growth for the current quarter on improving demand for its chips. Following weak demand last year due to concerns about the global economy, orders for Texas Instruments’ chips have picked up, although manufacturing customers remain cautious, Chief Financial Officer Kevin March told Reuters in a telephone interview. Texas Instruments’ book to bill ratio rose to 1.03 in the first quarter from 0.91 in the December quarter, he said, as the company built a backlog of orders. “People generally remain quite careful with how much inventory they choose to carry as they kind of wait to read the tea leaves to see what the economy is really going to do,”  March said. He pointed to industrial and automotive as markets with solid demand. As Texas Instruments winds down its low-margin wireless business, its analog and embedded chips contributed 77 percent of revenue in the March quarter, up five percentage points from the year-ago quarter. In the June quarter, revenue from the legacy wireless business will decline about $60 million from the March quarter, Texas Instruments said. TI, which sells chips for everything from personal computers to industrial equipment, reported net income of $362 million, or 32 cents a share compared with $265 million or 22 cents per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected earnings of 30 cents per share according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “I don’t think things are falling off a cliff. People are cautious. If you can get any part in six weeks why would you build inventory,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. TI’s revenue fell to $2.885 billion from $3.12 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average expected first-quarter revenue of $2.852 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It forecast second-quarter revenue between $2.93 billion and $3.17 billion. The midpoint of the range is $3.05 billion, slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations for $3.04 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It forecast second-quarter earnings per share of 37 cents to 45 cents. TI shares fell 0.43 percent to $34.66 in late trade after closing up 1.6 percent at $34.81 in the regular Nasdaq session on Monday.",4222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/texasinstruments-results/update-3-texas-instruments-sees-improved-but-cautious-demand-idUSL2N0D920E20130422

Nearly 125,000 copies of “I Love It”, featuring British singer Charli XCX, were sold in the past seven days. The single features in the TV advertising campaign for Samsung’s new Galaxy S4 smartphone and has been in the top 10 in 14 countries.

On the album chart, 22-year-old Briton Tom Odell entered at number one with his debut full length album “Long Way Down”.

59,TXN,"Texas Instruments upbeat about revenue, chip demand","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc gave a third-quarter revenue forecast that was stronger than some analysts expected and said customers seem more confident about placing orders for chips. Orders picked up in the first half of 2013 and Chief Financial Officer Kevin March told Reuters on Monday that business continues to improve, following weak demand last year due to concerns about the global economy. Texas Instruments’ book to bill ratio, a measure of orders filled, was 1.03 in the second quarter, unchanged from the prior quarter. A ratio of over 1 suggests a chipmaker received more orders than it could fill during a given period. TI’s customers are starting to give the No. 3 U.S. chipmaker a better idea about their future needs. “Up until this past quarter with these orders it’s been for pretty short-term deliveries, so that’s a bit of a change in tone and perhaps confidence on the part of our customers,” March said. Texas Instruments is winding down its wireless chip business as competition from Qualcomm Inc and other rivals has hurt profitability. TI is focusing on analog and embedded chips used in products ranging from cars to televisions and which account for the bulk of the company’s revenue. Analog and embedded account for 78 percent of TI’s revenue, up 6 percentage points from a year ago, the company said. “The quality of their earnings is moving much more significantly toward their core business and away from lower-gross margin wireless,” said FBR Capital Markets analyst Chris Rolland. Texas Instruments said its second-quarter results included a gain from the sale of some wireless connectivity technology as well as higher-than-expected charges from the company’s restructuring.

61,TXN,Texas Instruments fourth-quarter revenue outlook misses Street,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) forecast unexpectedly low fourth-quarter revenue, underscoring concerns about spotty demand for chips for cars, appliances, computers and industrial products and sending its shares lower. Demand for chips used in cars and communications infrastructure had improved in the third quarter, helping make up for a drop in revenue as TI wound down its unprofitable wireless business. “It looks like those segments now are decelerating,” said Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree. “It’s possible that the pace set earlier this year has left customers with a bit more inventory and that customers are being cautious managing their inventories heading into the end of year.” TI Chief Financial Officer Kevin March said in an interview on Monday that his expectations of a quarter-over-quarter decline in revenue were based on normal holiday seasonality in those segments. Analysts differ in what they consider to be normal seasonal variations in demand. “We don’t see anything that suggests to us anything other than a normal fourth quarter shaping up,” he said. “The Street had anticipated our normal seasonal calculator decline but I don’t think they had correctly anticipated the fourth quarter to be seasonally down.” TI said on Monday revenue fell to $3.244 billion from $3.390 billion in the third quarter last year. In the fourth quarter, revenue will range from $2.86 billion to $3.10 billion, the company estimated. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $3.226 billion for the third quarter and $3.116 billion for the current, fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In the third quarter, demand improved as expected from automakers and industrial customers, as well as makers of game consoles and handsets, March said. The company posted third-quarter net income of $629 million, or 56 cents a share, compared to $784 million, or 67 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. It said fourth-quarter earnings per share would range from 42 cents to 50 cents. Shares of Texas Instruments fell 3.44 percent in extended trade after closing up 0.69 percent at $40.99 on Nasdaq.

Investors also showed a reluctance to make aggressive bets ahead of Tuesday’s release of U.S. payrolls data for September, which was delayed by the recent government shutdown. The Dow was lower after McDonald’s Corp fell following a weak fourth-quarter outlook. A rally in Apple Inc  shares after a brokerage ratings upgrade helped the Nasdaq hold near the unchanged mark. Though only a small percentage of S&P; 500 stocks have reported earnings thus far, the season has been mixed, with revenue growth especially a concern. Still, profits have largely risen and many bellwether companies have topped expectations. “We are going into earnings season and the market is just starting to digest the things that have come into play. The numbers have actually been decent, but you are just getting started,” said Thomas Nyheim, vice president and portfolio manager at Christiana Trust in Greenville, Delaware. “That’s why there is not that much movement in the market, just anticipation.” With 21 percent of S&P; companies having reported, 61.5 percent have topped profit expectations, a rate slightly above the historical average. But only 52 percent have topped expectations on revenue, below the historical average of 61 percent. The S&P; 500 on Friday capped its biggest weekly gain in three months on stronger-than-expected earnings from Google  and Morgan Stanley, as well as a deal in Washington temporarily resolving a political deadlock over the budget and raising the debt-ceiling. The S&P; ended at a record high. S&P; sectors were mixed, with healthcare stocks making the biggest decline, down 0.6 percent. Nyheim, who manages investments in health care stocks, said the sector will be unpredictable until the effects of President Obama’s health care law play out. “The push for healthcare is going to be greater as more people age and come online. We just don’t know how it’s going to affect the bottom line,” said Nyheim. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 15.81 points, or 0.10 percent, at 15,383.84. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 1.65 points, or 0.09 percent, at 1,742.85. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 1.99 points, or 0.05 percent, at 3,916.27. Apple boosted the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq after Societe Generale lifted its price target on the stock to $575 from $500 and advised clients to buy shares. The stock rose 2.5 percent to $521.83 and was the largest winner on the Nasdaq, adding 7.8 points to the index. McDonald’s fell 0.8 percent to $94.42 after it reported revenue that missed estimates and warned global October sales could be relatively flat. More than 25 percent of the S&P; 500 components are due to report this week, with Texas Instruments and Netflix  among the stocks to report after Monday’s market closes. While Netflix shares have soared this year, few short sellers are expecting the stock to pull back following its results, a sign of how the Federal Reserve’s stimulus program has made successful negative bets by short sellers hard to execute. Hasbro Inc jumped 5.0 percent to a new all-time high as both earnings and sales topped expectations. Solar power companies were among the strongest on Monday, with First Solar Inc up 9.5 percent to $54.76 as the S&P;’s top percentage gainer. Trina Solar rose 4.6  percent to $17.32 while SolarCity Corp gained 2.1 percent to $60.60.

Shares of McDonald’s fell 0.9 percent to $94.35, ranking the restaurant chain as the top point decliner in the Dow industrials. McDonald’s reported revenue that missed estimates and warned global October sales could be relatively flat. Other companies expected to report results on Monday include Netflix and Texas Instruments.

Hasbro, up 7.7 percent at $50.91, was one of the top performers on the S&P; 500 after the toy maker topped Wall Street’s profit estimates.

68,TXN,"Texas Instruments to cut 1,100 jobs worldwide","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc plans to cut 1,100 jobs in the United States, Japan and India, or about 3 percent of its global workforce, in a corporate restructuring to save $130 million by the end of 2014. The U.S. chipmaker, which in 2012 announced it would lay off 1,700 people as it wound down its mobile processor business, said on Tuesday it wanted to reduce expenses in its embedded-processing division and in Japan. “Technology markets mature from time to time and you have to rebalance where you spend your money,” Chief Financial Officer Kevin March said in an interview. “In the case of Japan, the size of the market there has been declining for a number of years.” While TI is better known to many consumers for its calculators, the Dallas-based company is regarded as a barometer of the chip industry because it makes components for a variety of markets, including industrial, automotive, consumer electronics and communications. Demand for TI chips has gradually improved in recent months although many on Wall Street have been watching for a larger pickup, including an elusive buildup in inventories by manufacturing customers. March said most of TI’s customers have kept their inventories “extremely lean,” largely because TI in recent years has increased its own store of available components so that it can fill new orders quickly. Job cuts to TI’s embedded business are centered mostly on products that have seen slow growth, he said. The job cuts in Japan will include sales and customer support. TI took a $49 million charge in the fourth quarter, to be followed by about $30 million in the first. “This to me shows they believe there are some more efficient ways to run the business than they were running it,” RBC analyst Doug Freedman said of the chipmaker’s job cuts. TI is the second major chipmaker in the past week to announce layoffs. Intel Corp said on Friday it plans to reduce its global workforce of 107,000 by about 5 percent this year as the chipmaker, struggling with falling personal-computer sales, shifts focus to faster-growing areas. TI, which has gradually withdrawn from an intensely competitive mobile phone arena to focus on supplying chips for more lucrative markets like cars and communications, posted fourth-quarter revenue on Tuesday that was up 2 percent from the year-ago period, above expectations. TI reported fourth-quarter net income of $511 million, or 46 cents a share. The $49 million charge reduced earnings by 3 cents a share due to the restructuring. In the year-ago quarter, TI had net income of $264 million, or 23 cents.

74,TXN,Texas Instruments wants to hand more cash back to shareholders,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Texas Instruments (TXN.O) said on Thursday it plans to return more cash to its shareholders, expanding a capital management policy that has helped boost the chipmaker’s stock to its highest level in more than a decade. Improved manufacturing efficiencies mean Texas Instruments will now be able to turn between 20 percent and 30 percent of its revenue into free cash flow, Chief Financial Officer Kevin March said on a conference call with analysts. That is more than Texas Instruments’ previous free cash flow target range of between 20 percent and 25 percent of revenue set last year. In 2013, Texas Instruments promised that, except for money used to pay debts, it would return all of its free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks in what FBR analyst Chris Rolland called the “gold standard” of cash return policies. Texas Instruments will now also return to shareholders the proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options, March said. Chipmakers have been growing far less quickly than companies in other areas of the technology industry, like cloud computing and social media. “So now to entice shareholders they’re pushing the cash return story,” Rolland said of Texas Instruments and other chip companies. The changes to Texas Instruments’ capital management policy were incremental improvements but not enough to fuel an immediate stock rise, Rolland said. Its firm commitment to dividends and share buybacks over the past year have helped push the company’s stock to highs not seen since 2001. The stock is up 31 percent over the past 12 months. However, it slipped 1.3 percent to $45.84 alongside a lower underlying market on Thursday, after the company announced the new cash return policy. “Our capital management strategy reflects our beliefs that free cash flow growth is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term,” March said. The chipmaker’s ability to generate cash has been bolstered by growth in its analog and automotive businesses and by replacing older factories with newer, more efficient ones, he said. Last year, Texas instruments paid out $1.18 billion in dividends and spent $2.87 billion to repurchase stock. Other chipmakers have also made recent commitments to give more cash back to investors. Last week, Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) raised its cash dividend by 20 percent after vowing in November to return 75 percent of free cash flow to stock holders. Graphics chipmaker Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) in November increased its cash dividend by 13 percent and announced an additional $1 billion for its stock buyback program.

77,TXN,Strong analog chip demand boosts Texas Instruments forecast,"(Reuters) - Chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc’s (TXN.O) first-quarter revenue and second-quarter revenue forecast topped analysts’ estimates on growing demand for its chips used in communication equipment, industrial machines and automotive parts. Shares of Texas Instruments, also called TI, rose as much as 6 percent in extended trading. RBC Capital Markets analyst Doug Freedman said TI’s revenue got a boost due to higher demand from end-customers and an overall growth in the semiconductor industry. “The inventory levels for semiconductor devices are presently very low. So any uptick in demand is driving an uptick in sales,” Freedman said. TI said customer cancellations were “incredibly low right now”. The company, already looking to reduce its workforce and cut costs in less lucrative markets, said it would keep a cap on capital spending, which would help boost its margins. TI is exiting the low-margin mobile chip business to focus on the more profitable analog business, which makes chips for everything from automotive safety devices to electronics. Rival Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) on Wednesday posted its smallest quarterly revenue increase since 2010 as it wrestled with a smartphone market increasingly catering to consumers favoring less expensive devices. TI gets about 62 percent of its sales from its analog chip business, where revenue rose 11 percent in the first quarter ended March 31. Total revenue rose 3 percent to $2.98 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $2.96 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding its wireless business, which the company is winding up, revenue grew 11 percent. The Dallas, Texas-based company forecast second-quarter revenue of $3.14-$3.40 billion, largely above analysts’ estimates of $3.15 billion. Chief Financial Officer Kevin March said TI plans to keep its capital spending at about 4 percent of revenue, which would help gross margins. The cost consciousness meant its second-quarter earnings forecast of 55-63 cents per share was well ahead of analysts’ average estimate of 52 cents per share. The company’s first quarter net income rose 34 percent to $487 million, or 44 cents per share, including a gain of 2 cents per share from asset sales.

Still, the day’s losses were broad, and nine of the 10 primary S&P; 500 sector indexes fell. The S&P; energy sector index represented the only positive group, up 0.2 percent. U.S. crude oil for August delivery shot up 1.4 percent to settle at $104.59 ahead of Tuesday’s contract expiry. Violence escalated in the Gaza Strip despite growing international calls for a cease-fire. The Palestinian death toll rose above 500 while Israel’s losses also mounted. While the impact to the U.S. economy is seen as minimal, investors are concerned about the fallout from an extended period of increased violence as well as the prospect that it could spread to other parts of the Middle East. Market participants also kept watch on the uncertain situation in Ukraine, where fighting flared in the city of Donetsk. Last week a Malaysian Airlines jet was shot down over Ukraine, adding to an already tense situation between the country and Russia. The United States and the European Union announced further economic sanctions against Russian interests last week before the Malaysian Airlines jet was shot down, and sanctions could become even more stringent. “We’re certainly paying attention to the issues abroad, but right now, they don’t seem like the kind of events that will have anything beyond a short-term impact,” said John Chisholm, chief investment officer at Acadian Asset Management in Boston. “We expect these uncertainties to be reversed in two or three weeks.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.45 points or 0.28 percent, to end at 17,051.73. The S&P; 500 declined 4.59 points or 0.23 percent, to finish at 1,973.63. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.44 points or 0.17 percent, to close at 4,424.70. The CBOE Volatility Index climbed 6.2 percent to 12.81, a level that is well below its historical average of 20. Some analysts have suggested that the low volatility has left the market - which hasn’t had a correction, defined as a 10 percent pullback, since October 2011 - vulnerable to a shock. “Markets aren’t particularly attractive, and it seems likely that we’ll see a correction of 10 to 15 percent, though the timing on that is very difficult to say,” Chisholm said. After the market closed, Netflix Inc reported a quarterly profit that more than doubled from a year ago, sending shares up 0.7 percent to $455.08 after the bell. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc jumped 9.3 percent to $644.50 after the market closed after reporting second-quarter revenue that sharply exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Texas Instruments Inc also reported second-quarter revenue that beat expectations after the market closed, but shares were flat at $49.17 in extended trading. During the regular session, Herbalife Ltd dropped 11 percent to $54.02 after Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman, who is short the stock, told CNBC he would present evidence on Tuesday that the company is an “incredible fraud.” McDonald’s Corp shares slid 1.5 percent to $97.55 and Yum Brands Inc shares fell 4.2 percent to $74.13 as the fast-food restaurant chains face a new food safety scare in China, denting efforts to shore up reputations hurt by a 2012 safety scandal in one of their biggest markets. About 61 percent of stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange ended the day lower, while 59 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares finished the regular session in negative territory. About 4.91 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, below the month-to-date average of 5.6 billion.

89,TXN,"Wall St. extends rebound on earnings, ECB report","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday, with the S&P; 500 notching a fourth straight session of gains boosted by strong corporate results, including Apple’s. The S&P; 500 and Dow Jones were up more than 1 percent while the Nasdaq rose more than 2 percent, thanks to better-than-expected results from several major tech companies.  The bullish tone was helped by a Reuters story that said the European Central Bank is considering buying corporate bonds. It led to active futures trading before the opening bell and helped lift European stocks from last week’s 13-month low.  “That is allowing the market to breathe a little sigh of relief,” said Kevin Caron, market strategist at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co in Florham Park, New Jersey. “The market has come to fear the absence of central banks.”  The S&P; 500 has gained more than 6 percent from its session low last Wednesday, when the benchmark nearly reached correction territory. It closed Tuesday above both its 14-day moving average and its 200-day average. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 215.14 points, or 1.31 percent, to 16,614.81, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 37.27 points, or 1.96 percent, to 1,941.28 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 103.40 points, or 2.4 percent, to 4,419.48. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) rose 2.7 percent to $102.47 a day after revenue topped expectations, helped by strong iPhone sales. It also gave a strong outlook for the holiday quarter.  The largest percentage gainer and decliner on the S&P; 500 were both related to earnings. The top gainer was Waters Corp (WAT.N), which rose 9.9 percent, while the largest decliner was Chipotle (CMG.N), down 7 percent.  The largest gainer on the Nasdaq 100 was Illumina Inc (ILMN.O), which rose 9.2 percent and the largest decliner was Starbucks (SBUX.O), down only 0.5 percent. While earnings have largely come in strong so far this quarter, concerns continue to swirl over the pace of global economic growth. China’s gross domestic product grew 7.3 percent in the third quarter, the slowest pace since the first quarter of 2009.  “This rebound is going to be short-term in nature,” said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management LLC in New York. “The reasons for the market meltdown from last week are still there.”  U.S. existing home sales rose 2.4 percent in September, above expectations, hitting their highest level in a year. The PHLX Housing index .HGX rose 1.2 percent.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,557 to 538, for a 4.75-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 2,008 issues rose and 668 fell for a 3.01-to-1 ratio.

Financial spreadbetters predicted European bourses would follow Asia higher, with Britain’s FTSE 100 seen opening up 23 points, or 0.4 percent, Germany’s DAX 60 points, or 0.7 percent, and France’s CAC 40 .FCHI 21 points, or 0.5 percent. “Ahead of the European open, we are eyeing further gains yet again, with limited releases on the calendar to work from,” IG market strategist Stan Shamu wrote in a note. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  rose 1 percent to a nearly two-week high, while Japan’s Nikkei stock average ended 2.6 percent higher, clawing back ground lost in Tuesday’s 2 percent drop. Sentiment also got a lift from a Reuters report that the ECB is considering buying corporate bonds, a step that would help banks free up more of their balance sheets for lending. The ECB might decide on the matter as soon as December with a view to begin purchases early next year, several sources familiar with the situation said. “The news triggered bargain-hunting as Japanese shares have fallen to levels which priced in the worst-case scenario,” said Toru Ibayashi, executive director at UBS Wealth Management, referring to fears that Europe’s economy would fall back into recession. In U.S. trading, shares of Apple Inc and Texas Instruments Inc gained on stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings, lifting the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index more than 2 percent. The S&P; 500 added 1.96 percent to mark its biggest daily percentage gain since October 2013 and its fourth straight rising session. Japanese trade data released early Wednesday also underpinned buying in Tokyo. Exports rose 6.9 percent in September from a year earlier, the fastest pace in seven months, in a tentative sign that external demand is starting to pick up. The upbeat mood in global equities markets sapped the safe-haven appeal of U.S. Treasuries, pushing their yields away from last week’s 17-month lows. The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes stood at 2.211 percent in late Asian trade, up from Tuesday’s U.S. close of 2.208 percent. Higher U.S. yields supported bolster the greenback, with the dollar index steady on the day at 85.301. Data on Tuesday showing a stronger-than-expected 2.4 percent rise in U.S. domestic home resales last month provided evidence that the U.S. economic recovery maintained momentum and also put upward pressure on yields. “Given heightened concern about falling inflation expectations, the attention turns to the U.S. September CPI report,” strategists at Barclays said. “Our thesis of USD outperformance driven by relative U.S. strength and interest rate divergence remains intact, but is at risk of delay pending soft underlying inflation trends.” The CPI report is due at 1230 GMT. Economists expect annual core CPI inflation to stay flat at 1.7 percent in September, and a cooler reading would add to speculation that the Federal Reserve will wait longer before raising interest rates. The consensus view is that the U.S. central bank will decide to wrap up its asset purchases under its third round of quantitative easing later this month at its Oct 28-29 policy meeting, though short-term interest rates futures implied markets do not expect the Fed to hike rates until late 2015. The dollar inched lower on the day against the yen to 106.91 yen, while the euro nursed its losses after dropping on the ECB news, and edged slightly higher to $1.2727. In commodities markets, Brent crude added about 0.1 percent to $86.31 a barrel after posting solid gains on Tuesday, helped by data showing stronger-than-expected China demand and some technical price recovery after weeks of almost uninterrupted selling. Spot gold was slightly lower on the day at $1,247.80 an ounce, but still not far from a six-week high marked in the previous session.

105,TXN,Nvidia wants to leap from video games to self-driving cars,"* Car companies use Nvidia’s “supercomputer on a chip” * Automotive culture invades Silicon Valley * Chipmaker’s rivals include Intel, Texas Instruments * Learning the meaning of “automotive grade” By Paul Lienert DETROIT, May 14 (Reuters) - It took Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia Corp the better part of a decade to gain acceptance as a global automotive supplier, a lesson for other technology firms hoping to make a similar transition from consumer electronics to car components. Nvidia had a thriving business in supplying powerful graphics processors for video game consoles and laptop computers when representatives of Volkswagen AG asked if it could adapt the same realistic, three-dimensional displays for the dashboards of Audi luxury cars. That was 10 years ago - several lifetimes in Silicon Valley terms, but just a couple of model changes ago for the big car maker. It took six years for Nvidia to develop the chips to power the 3-D navigation system display that launched on the 2011 Audi A8, the brand’s top-of-the-line sedan, compared with three to four years to develop a new chip for gaming applications. Along the way, Nvidia engineers learned the hard way they could not just pop a chip designed for a laptop or a game console into a car. “We had to be taught what ‘automotive grade’ meant,” recalls Danny Shapiro, Nvidia’s senior director of automotive operations. In simple terms, that meant no reboots - because a dashboard screen that fails to light up means an angry customer and possibly an expensive warranty repair. The decade-long effort enabled Nvidia to make the jump from the world of computers and game consoles into the fast-growing market for advanced automotive displays and automated driving systems. It is a leap that other Silicon Valley tech companies want to emulate to cash in on the convergence of automobiles and digital connectivity. Nvidia’s success in landing processors on cars including the Audi A8 and the Tesla Model S sedan illustrates the growing willingness among automakers to look beyond their traditional suppliers to obtain a technological edge. “They offer us computing systems with the strength” to process vast amounts of data required by new driver assistance systems and displays, said Ulrich Hackenberg, Audi’s head of technical development. Nvidia is still a niche player with a long way to go to crack the top league of traditional automotive chip suppliers. Much larger companies, including Japan’s Renesas Electronics Corp and U.S. chipmakers Texas Instruments Inc, Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc, dominate the automotive chip business. Nvidia’s automotive sales represented just 4 percent of the company’s $4.7 billion annual revenue in its most recent fiscal year. That in turn is just one-tenth of the $1.86 billion in automotive semiconductors that Texas Instruments sold last year. Brooke Williams, TI’s business manager for driver assistance systems, said his company already knows how to deal with automakers’ demands after 35 years of supplying products for vehicles. “We understand the automotive design cycle and how the vehicle manufacturers and suppliers work.” SELF-DRIVING CARS Nvidia has made the leap to infotainment systems in vehicles, but not yet to self-driving cars. The company had just $23 million in sales in the automotive segment in 2011. Growth has surged since. This year, the company expects automotive revenue of $183 million, and says it has booked more than $2 billion in future automotive business, most of that involving chips for digital displays and infotainment. By 2020, Nvidia expects to have chips on more than 32 million vehicles. The company is pushing to crack the emerging market for driver assistance systems, which include such tasks as self-parking and semi-automated steering and braking. Those systems require huge amounts of computing power in very small packages. Nvidia has developed and begun selling a chip called the Tegra X1 for automotive and gaming uses, which it says can put the power of a supercomputer in a package about the size of a postage stamp. “Nvidia brings unparalleled graphics capabilities that could prove critical building blocks” for driver assistance systems, said Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore. Nvidia got coaching from automotive customers who liked the company’s technology but were not sure of its ability to measure up to their standards. Early in their relationship, Audi executives took Nvidia engineers on a trip to Audi’s home factory in Ingolstadt, Germany. “We told the Nvidia guys, ‘you make one part, but we assemble a car here from 10,000 pieces,’” said Mathias Halliger, Audi’s senior systems architect for connected vehicle technologies. “If even one part is bad, we have a problem.” To drive home the point, an Audi tour guide noted that one of the luxury cars had been rejected because of a tiny flaw in the paint. The plant tour, Halliger said, “helped Nvidia to understand our requirements. It showed dramatically what we were looking for.” There was more for Nvidia to learn. A typical automotive production cycle can run five years or more, compared with one year for many consumer products. Nvidia had to go back to its suppliers to make sure that key components, from memory to power supply, could be upgraded as needed over that longer life cycle. “When you work with car companies and you engage in these developments with them, over the years you adopt their culture,” said Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang, whose personal automotive stable includes two Ferraris and two Teslas.  “But the car is dying to be reinvented.”   (Editing by Joe White and Matthew Lewis)",5142015,http://www.reuters.com/article/nvidia-autos/nvidia-wants-to-leap-from-video-games-to-self-driving-cars-idUSL2N0XE11L20150514
106,TXN,Texas Instruments tipped as chip industry's next consolidator,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc (TI) (TXN.O) could be gearing up to make the next big deal in what has already been a record-breaking year for semiconductor M&A;, industry bankers and analysts said. The Dallas, Texas-based chipmaker, which has a market capitalization of $56 billion, has so far stayed on the sidelines as peers Intel Corp (INTC.O), Avago Technologies Ltd (AVGO.O) and NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) made acquisitions worth tens of billions of dollars earlier this year. TI is looking for large acquisitions as well, according to people familiar with the matter. It held talks to acquire Maxim Integrated Products Inc (MXIM.O) late last year but discussions broke off when Maxim, which has a market capitalization of about $10 billion, decided not to sell itself, the people said.  TI also considered buying Freescale Semiconductor Ltd FSL.N before Freescale agreed to be acquired by NXP in March for $11.8 billion, the people said.   A TI spokeswoman said the company has a long-standing policy to not comment on market rumors and speculation or competitor activity. Maxim declined to comment and Freescale did not respond to a request for comment. If Texas Instruments chief executive Rich Templeton doesn’t make a move soon, the company could run out of high value targets, FBR Capital Markets analyst Christopher Rolland said. TI should act by the end of the year while NXP, one of its fastest growing rivals, is tied up awaiting approval for its merger with Freescale, he said.  “If I was TI, I would think of what NXP’s next target would be and should I get there first,” Rolland said. Driving TI’s appetite for M&A;, according to the sources, is a desire to improve on its profitability and increase its share in the fragmented market for analog chips, which process signals such as sound, light and temperature and convert them into digital signals, and are central to smart phones and devices connected to the Internet. To be sure, TI is not the only big semiconductor company on the hunt for a large deal. Larger peer Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), which has a market capitalization of $110 billion, may look to make a substantial acquisition to bulk up its data center and cloud businesses, as its mobile phone customers see their markets mature, some of the people said. Qualcomm declined to comment.  The right deal could boost TI’s operating margins and profits by increasing the utilization rates in TI’s 21 fabrication plants in nine countries. This could be done by tapping the production volumes from the acquisition target over a number of years, according to analysts.  In addition to Maxim, TI could look at Analog Devices Inc (ADI.O), Linear Technology Corp LLTC.O, Microchip Technology Inc (MCHP.O), Intersil Corp ISIL.O and Atmel Corp ATML.O, a $4 billion microcontroller company which Reuters reported last week was exploring options, analysts said. Microcontrollers are small computer processors designed to do tasks that are used in a variety of electronics. TI has a microcontroller business.   Semiconductor dealmaking has reached $79.7 billion so far this year, an amount that already surpasses every full-year period on record, with the exception of 2000, when M&A; in the sector hit $115.5 billion. TI focuses on analog and embedded chips, which are used in products ranging from cars to televisions and account for the bulk of the company’s revenue.  TI’s chief financial officer Kevin March said on a conference call with analysts last fall that TI would prefer to buy an analog company that sells into the industrial and automotive markets, or one that provides catalog parts which are non-custom silicon parts. Some analysts said however that TI is very price conscious. Wedbush Securities analyst Betsy Van Hees said TI has done well by not pursuing big M&A; for four years, focusing instead on its core competencies in analog and microcontrollers. Since it bought National Semiconductor for $6.5 billion in 2011, its last large scale acquisition which some analysts have argued it overpaid for, TI developed a reputation as an M&A; skeptic, preferring to use its cash flow to buy back shares and pay dividends.  “There’s no question that TI gets a first look at everything but they have a real rigid strategy in terms of what they expect for their return on invested capital. If it doesn’t fit that box, they don’t acquire it,” Van Hees said.

108,TXN,Options traders exhibit caution ahead of chip earnings,"NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - Hedging activity is rising for U.S. semiconductor stocks as investors fear that sector earnings may be weak, and share prices may fall after a recent flourish in mergers and acquisitions. Options bets on an exchange-traded fund that tracks the sector have long been bearish, but there was a noticeable rise in hedging activity in June. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index lost 9 percent in June, more than twice the 4.4 percent fall for the broader S&P; 500 Information Technology Index. The Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF touched an all-time high of $60.13 in June but has lost 9 percent, and was down 48 cents at $54.64 on Monday. “The price action in both the ETF and the semiconductor index are indicating that there is trouble ahead,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. Sentiment has been hurt after Micron Technology Inc  gave a dismal earnings forecast in late June, citing a further drop in personal computer chip prices due to weak demand for PCs. Since Micron’s forecast, puts activity has increased for Intel and Texas Instruments, two of the ETF’s top holdings. With analysts expecting a choppy earnings season for chip companies, options traders have been lapping up the ETF’s put, usually used to place bearish bets. Overall open interest, which had dropped to 70,000 contracts mid-May, has nearly trebled with puts outnumbering calls nearly 5-to-1. The ETF’s puts had attracted heavy hedging activity earlier this year as well, when puts outnumbered calls by about 10-to-1. “The sheer volume in the puts leads me to believe that traders are hedging for earnings or general market volatility,” said Jim Smith, options strategist at OTR Global. Big mergers in the sector, including Avago Technologies Ltd’s $37 billion deal for Broadcom and Intel Corp’s $16.7 billion purchase of Altera, have put the spotlight on the sector as the largest players look to beef up capabilities. Most semi stocks currently include some M&A; premium, and this could be problematic for companies that do not get acquired, analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group said in a recent note. Weak personal computer demand and slowing tablet growth could also be affecting sentiment. Buyers of August puts at the $57 and $53 strike prices have pushed up open interest in the SMH ETF, with the two strikes now making up for about a fifth of the total open interest in the ETF’s options.

109,TXN,UPDATE 2-Texas Instruments revenue forecast misses on weak chip demand,"(Adds details on business segments; updates shares) By Kshitiz Goliya and Abhirup Roy July 22 (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc forecast third-quarter revenue below analysts’ expectations due to weak demand for its chips used in PCs and industrial and communications equipment. The company, which also reported lower-than-expected revenue for the second quarter, said its communications business was hurt by weak demand from wireless base stations. Chief Financial Officer Kevin March said the company did not expect any recovery in communications or PC markets in the current quarter. “With industrial slowing a bit like it did in the second quarter, we are expecting that our third quarter will be probably a little bit weaker than we would normally expect at this time of the year,” March told Reuters. Industrial and communications equipment markets accounted for nearly half of TI’s 2014 revenue, with PCs making up for less than 10 percent. Smaller rival Linear Technology Corp also reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue on Tuesday, hurt by weak bookings in its industrial business. TI’s revenue from its analog business, under which it makes chips that convert real-world signals such as sound and temperature into digital data that can be processed by microprocessors, rose 3 percent to $2.05 billion. Revenue from its embedded processing business, under which it makes microcontrollers and connectivity products, declined 1.8 percent to $690 million, hurt by lower sales of processors. TI forecast a profit of 62-72 cents per share and revenue of $3.15 billion-$3.41 billion for the third quarter. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 75 cents per share and revenue of $3.47 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. TI’s net income rose about 2 percent to $696 million, or 65 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 30. Revenue fell 1.8 percent to $3.23 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 65 per share and revenue of $3.26 billion. TI’s shares rose about 2 percent to $50.20 in after-hours trading on Wednesday, reversing a decline.

STMicro’s imaging business provided the stand out performance, sales more than doubling in the last three months to $158 million. Demand has been ramping up for the company’s new Time of Flight sensors, which analysts widely believe Apple is buying as a proximity or motion detector to use in its latest iPhones.  STMicro posted net revenue of $2.14 billion, up 18.9 percent year-on-year, putting the diversified chipmaker on track to deliver 18 percent growth in 2017, the company said.  If confirmed it would mark the first time that STMicro has recorded solid double-digit growth since 2010. The company generated double-digit sales growth across all four of its business lines compared to the year-ago quarter. All major regions grew by double digits both compared to a year ago and between the second and third quarters.  Third-quarter gross margins rose to an average of 39.5 percent, slightly above the 39 percent target that the company set in July. It said it expected fourth-quarter margins of 39.9 percent, plus or minus 2 percentage points.  “We see clear opportunities in front of us to continue to drive revenue growth, margin expansion and shareholder value and we are determined to capture this additional potential,” Chief Executive and President Carlo Bozotti said in a statement.

154,TXN,Texas Instruments' revenue growth slowdown rattles investors,"(Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) on Tuesday posted the slowest revenue growth in four quarters on softer demand for its chips used in communications equipment, disappointing investors who expected sales for automotive chips to drive strong results. Shares of the Dallas-based company fell about 7 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday after earnings also failed to exceed Wall Street expectations for the first time in at least two years. Investors also reacted to a tepid forecast for current-quarter revenue. TI’s revenue rose nearly 10 percent in the fourth quarter, but growth is expected to slow down to about 7 percent in the quarter ending March, based on the mid-point of the company’s forecast. That compares with growth of 12 percent to 13 percent each in the first three quarters of 2017. Though TI saw strong demand for chips used in automobiles and by industries, Chief Executive Officer Richard Templeton said the business that makes chips used in communications equipment faced soft demand. “That’s a market that traditionally is choppy,” he said. Communications equipment made up 13 percent of Texas Instruments’ revenue in 2016. TI has benefited in recent years as many automakers pivot toward self-driving vehicle technology. The automotive market contributed 18 percent of the company’s revenue in 2016.

157,TXN,"UPDATE 3-TI profit tops estimates on automotive, industrial demand; shares rise","(Reuters) - Chipmaker Texas Instruments (TXN.O) topped Wall Street targets for first-quarter profit and gave a stronger-than-expected outlook for the second quarter, thanks to higher sales of semiconductors used in cars and industrial machinery. TI’s shares, which have fallen 6 percent in 2018, climbed more than 5 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday. The Dallas-based chipmaker, which primarily develops analog chips used in industrial equipment, automobiles and consumer electronics, has benefited as automakers increasingly invest in self-driving technology. The automotive industry accounted for 19 percent of TI’s revenue last year, up from 18 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in the previous year. The company has continued to invest in its industrial and automotive chip businesses to strengthen its position, Dave Pahl, the company’s vice president and head of investor relations, said on a call with analysts. “This is based on our belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets. They have increasing semiconductor content. These markets also provide diversity and longevity,” Pahl said. TI’s results come one week after semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research Corp’s (LRCX.O) quarterly report showed that its shipments missed Wall Street expectations for the first time since 2013. Lam’s results dragged other semiconductor stocks lower, and the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index .SOX has since fallen 8.4 percent. The index has almost doubled in value over the past two years thanks to booming demand for chips used in automobiles, internet-connected devices and consumer gadgets. For the second quarter, TI expects revenue of between $3.78 billion and $4.10 billion, and earnings of $1.19 to $1.39 per share. The earnings forecast includes an estimated $10 million tax benefit. Analysts were expecting revenue of $3.90 billion and earnings of $1.23 per share. “(TI’s second-quarter outlook) indicates that at least for them, the industry must be holding up well. We are not seeing any type of slowdown in demand for TI,” said David Heger, an analyst at Edward Jones. TI’s net income rose 37 percent to $1.37 billion or $1.35 per share in the three months ended March 31. Excluding items, the company earned $1.21 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 10 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

161,TXN,RPT-ZTE tells suppliers China trade row may be factor in U.S. ban - source,"(Repeats story first published late Wednesday; no change to text) By Karen Freifeld NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters) - China’s ZTE Corp held a conference call on Wednesday with major suppliers, during which a company representative suggested the trade dispute with Beijing may have been a factor in last week’s U.S. order banning American firms from selling goods to the smartphone maker, according to a person familiar with the call. The Commerce Department last week banned American firms from doing business with ZTE after the company violated an agreement reached after it was caught selling U.S. goods to Iran despite U.S. sanctions. The ZTE representative on the call said it would be naive to think the ban was ordered in “a vacuum” and was assumed to be connected to the U.S.-China trade war, the person said. The U.S. has threatened to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to warn that it would retaliate if Washington pushes ahead. The U.S. also has taken actions aimed at reducing access to the U.S. by ZTE and Chinese tech company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd amid allegations the companies could be using their technology to spy on Americans. In response to a Reuters request for comment, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said late Wednesday that the order was “a law enforcement matter unrelated to broader trade policy,” according to a statement provided by a spokesman. The conference call took place between ZTE and more than a dozen members of the Semiconductor Industry Association, the person said. “It was a factual update on what happened, what they’ve done since the order was put in place, and what they’re doing to remedy the situation,” a Semiconductor Industry Association spokesman said. “There was no discussion of helping ZTE advocate before the U.S. government.” U.S. companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE’s equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks. Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc, which is one of ZTE’s top suppliers, said on Wednesday the loss of ZTE’s business will hurt its third quarter earnings. Canalys, a technology consultancy, estimated that 65 percent of ZTE phones contain Qualcomm chips. It is not known whether a Qualcomm representative was on the ZTE call and the company declined to comment. A ZTE spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Aside from Qualcomm, ZTE’s other major business partners include Alphabet Inc’s Google, Texas Instruments Inc and GlobalFoundries. ZTE also sent a letter to its business partners on Wednesday, explaining why it believes the seven-year ban was a “drastic action” out of proportion to its misconduct. According to a copy of the letter obtained by Reuters, ZTE said the order should be “very concerning to all,” since it took effect without warning to the industry, without waiting for the results of an independent internal investigation due at the end of the month, and without recognition for all the improvements in its export compliance program. ZTE invested over $50 million in 2017 in improving its compliance program and planned to increase that spending this year, the letter says. The Commerce Department ban was ignited when ZTE admitted in March that while it had fired four senior employees, it had not disciplined or reduced bonuses to 35 others when it said it had. In the letter, ZTE said that once it confirmed the employee bonuses were not reduced and reprimands not completed, it disclosed the information and took “immediate remedial action.” The order “sends the wrong message” to other companies who may be considering settling with the Commerce Department over export control issues, ZTE said. It said it was committed to complying with the order and U.S. export control regulations “while seeking a resolution to the matter on all available fronts and with the support of many of our business partners.” (Reporting by Karen Freifeld in New York and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Chris Sanders & Shri Navaratnam)",4262018,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-zte/rpt-zte-tells-suppliers-china-trade-row-may-be-factor-in-u-s-ban-source-idUSL1N1S305E

The U.S. also has taken actions aimed at reducing access to the U.S. by ZTE and Chinese tech company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] amid allegations the companies could be using their technology to spy on Americans. In response to a Reuters request for comment, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said late Wednesday that the order was “a law enforcement matter unrelated to broader trade policy,” according to a statement provided by a spokesman. The conference call took place between ZTE and more than a dozen members of the Semiconductor Industry Association, the person said. “It was a factual update on what happened, what they’ve done since the order was put in place, and what they’re doing to remedy the situation,” a Semiconductor Industry Association spokesman said. “There was no discussion of helping ZTE advocate before the U.S. government.”  U.S. companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE’s equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks. Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), which is one of ZTE’s top suppliers, said on Wednesday the loss of ZTE’s business will hurt its third quarter earnings. Canalys, a technology consultancy, estimated that 65 percent of ZTE phones contain Qualcomm chips.  It is not known whether a Qualcomm representative was on the ZTE call and the company declined to comment. A ZTE spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Aside from Qualcomm, ZTE’s other major business partners include Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) and GlobalFoundries [CSMF.UL]. ZTE also sent a letter to its business partners on Wednesday, explaining why it believes the seven-year ban was a “drastic action” out of proportion to its misconduct. According to a copy of the letter obtained by Reuters, ZTE said the order should be “very concerning to all,” since it took effect without warning to the industry, without waiting for the results of an independent internal investigation due at the end of the month, and without recognition for all the improvements in its export compliance program.   ZTE invested over $50 million in 2017 in improving its compliance program and planned to increase that spending this year, the letter says. The Commerce Department ban was ignited when ZTE admitted in March that while it had fired four senior employees, it had not disciplined or reduced bonuses to 35 others when it said it had.  In the letter, ZTE said that once it confirmed the employee bonuses were not reduced and reprimands not completed, it disclosed the information and took “immediate remedial action.”  The order “sends the wrong message” to other companies who may be considering settling with the Commerce Department over export control issues, ZTE said.   It said it was committed to complying with the order and U.S. export control regulations “while seeking a resolution to the matter on all available fronts and with the support of many of our business partners.” (This version of the story was refiled to correct name of company in 16th paragraph)      ",4262018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-zte/zte-tells-suppliers-china-trade-row-may-be-factor-in-u-s-ban-source-idUSKBN1HX0BM
163,TXN,REFILE-ZTE tells suppliers China trade row may be factor in U.S. ban - source,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - China’s ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) held a conference call on Wednesday with major suppliers, during which a company representative suggested the trade dispute with Beijing may have been a factor in last week’s U.S. order banning American firms from selling goods to the smartphone maker, according to a person familiar with the call. The Commerce Department last week banned American firms from doing business with ZTE after the company violated an agreement reached after it was caught selling U.S. goods to Iran despite U.S. sanctions. The ZTE representative on the call said it would be naive to think the ban was ordered in “a vacuum” and was assumed to be connected to the U.S.-China trade war, the person said. The U.S. has threatened to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to warn that it would retaliate if Washington pushes ahead.
