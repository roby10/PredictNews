1,JNJ,UPDATE 2-Medtronic deals to expand surgical device offerings," * To acquire two privately held companies   * Currently has ownership stake in both companies   * To expand presence in advanced energy surgical devices  (Rewrites first paragraph, adds Salient deal, detail, analyst comment, stock price)   CHICAGO, July 7 (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc (MDT.N) on Thursday said it struck deals to acquire two privately held companies in a bid to expand its presence in advanced surgical devices dominated by rivals Covidien Plc COV.N and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N).   Medtronic, the world’s largest stand alone medical device company, agreed to buy the part of Salient Surgical Technologies Inc that it does not already own, for about $480 million.   Including Medtronic’s existing ownership stake in the manufacturer of instruments used for haemostatic sealing of soft tissue and bone, the value of the transaction is $525 million.   Salient has annualized revenue of about $100 million.   Salient’s devices are used in a variety of surgical procedures including orthopedic surgery, spine, open abdominal and thoracic procedures.   Its products use its patented Transcollation technology to provide haemostatic sealing of soft tissue and bone. Its AquaMantys product line is used primarily in orthopedic cases, including hip and knee replacement, trauma, and spine procedures.   Medtronic also announced plans to buy Peak Surgical Inc, which makes high-tech surgical cutting and coagulation instruments.   Medtronic currently holds an ownership stake in Peak. Excluding the existing stake, the transaction value is about $105 million. Including the stake, the transaction value is $120 million.   Peak, with annualized revenue of roughly $20 million, specializes in surgical instruments based on its proprietary PlasmaBlade technology.   The PlasmaBlade line consists of a family of disposable cutting devices with proprietary insulation technology that provides the exacting control of a scalpel and the bleeding control of traditional electrosurgery with minimal thermal tissue damage.   The technology is cleared for use in a variety of settings, including ear, nose and throat; plastic/reconstructive; orthopedic; and general surgical applications, Medtronic said.   Michael Weinstein, an analyst with JP Morgan, said in a research note that the transactions are expected to be neutral to fiscal years 2012 and 2013 earnings per share, excluding one-time items, and add to earnings thereafter.   However, he added, “getting to neutral in fiscal year 2012 requires by our math significant upfront synergies. Therefore, we wouldn’t be surprised to see the deals end up at least in fiscal year 2012 1 cent to 2 cents dilutive.”   “We expect Medtronic to remain an active acquirer going forward, as it looks to supplement flagging growth in its core CRM (cardiac rhythm management) and Spine businesses,” he wrote.   He said the deals are a “solid strategic fit” and are too small to move the needle in the near-term, but “they bolster the company’s presence in the rapidly growing surgical technology arena,” he said.   Derrick Sung, an analyst with Bernstein Research, noted that combined, both companies are seeing sales growth of about 30 percent and both sell products in the attractive $2 billion-plus advanced energy surgical products market.   Medtronic shares were up 18 cents to $38.26 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, tracking a rally in the broad market.

5,JNJ,J&J; sued over sales deal for oral cancer product,"(Reuters) - J&J (JNJ.N) was sued by a company called Oral Cancer Prevention International that claimed the drug major “interfered” with a sales agreement related to the distribution of an oral cancer prevention product to protect sales of its popular mouthwash, Listerine, according to court documents.  The complaint accuses J&J on three counts: fraud, tortuous interference with contract and civil conspiracy. It seeks at least $60 million in damages and at least $10 million in punitive damages on each of the three counts.  The lawsuit is regarding a contract Oral Cancer Prevention signed in February 2010 with J&J’s former unit, OraPharma Inc, under which OraPharma exclusively distributed OCPI’s Oral CDx Brush Test, which identifies precancerous cells in the mouth.  The complaint said J&J was concerned about a study published in Australia that linked mouthwashes with a high alcohol content to cancer, adding that J&J did not want to “lend credence to the link between Listerine and oral cancer” by selling both its mouthwash and OralCDx.  “Johnson & Johnson induced OraPharma to breach the sales agreement to suppress sales of and withhold from the public a proven life-saving oral cancer prevention product,” the complaint filed on July 6 said.  The suit was filed in federal court in Trenton, New Jersey.  “The company is confident that we have engaged in proper business practices and we look forward to the opportunity to resolve this matter through the legal system,” J&J spokesman Bill Price told Reuters.  OraPharma could not be reached immediately for comment.  The case is Oral Cancer Prevention International v.

7,JNJ,"Doctors overuse heart treatment, despite guidelines","NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The controversial use of stents days after a heart attack has continued unabated in the United States, even after a landmark study and new guidelines said the pricey therapy does not help patients.  Just over half of patients who have survived at least 24 hours after a heart attack will have a stent — a small metal mesh tube — placed to open a blocked coronary artery, and that rate has not changed from 2005 through 2008.  The findings add to concerns about overuse of the heart devices, made by companies such as Boston Scientific, Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic Inc and Johnson & Johnson.  Stenting procedures cost the United States about $12 billion every year, and researchers say it is time doctors take responsibility for the nation’s spiraling health costs.  “I think physicians have to rise to the challenge,” said Dr. Judith Hochman, a cardiologist at New York University, who led the new work.  In 2006, Hochman published a study known as the Occluded Artery Trial showing that stents did not prevent any deaths or new heart attacks compared with drugs alone when inserted more than 24 hours after a heart attack into a totally blocked artery.  While the people who got stents did not experience any more side effects, the devices did rack up an extra $7,000 in net cost per person after two years, Hochman later found.  “After a day or so, whatever damage is going to be done was done already,” she told Reuters Health. “The message is to seek medical care soon after a heart attack, and that is when stenting really helps.”  Hochman’s results became part of revised guidelines from the American Heart Association and other groups in 2007, which recommend against using stents more than 24 hours after a heart attack in stable patients.  Her new study, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine (bit.ly/7qXyI), is based on nearly 29,000 patients seen at 896 U.S. hospitals.  It shows that neither the 2006 trial nor the revised guidelines had a noticeable effect on stent use.  “Overall there was no change in practice,” Hochman said. “I expected to see a change, so it was a big surprise and a disappointment.”  Hochman’s findings apply to about 100,000 Americans a year, suggesting that about 50,000 people are having the $20,000 procedure done unnecessarily every year.  That is in addition to thousands of stents inserted outside the context of emergencies such as a heart attack, according to a study from last week showing at least one in 12 of those procedures probably leads to more harm than benefit.  Each year in the United States, about 600,000 stents are inserted into ailing hearts where they prop open blocked arteries.  The stenting procedure, called percutaneous coronary intervention, or PCI, carries risks of complications like major bleeding or tears in the heart. After leaving the hospital, people also need to take clot-busting medications, which further increase the chance of bleeds.  Studies have found that many doctors rush to do PCI before using medications that might help stable patients just as well.  In an editorial, Dr. Mauro Moscucci of the University of Miami said Hochman’s study had inadequate information about the severity of heart attacks, which might have justified the use of stenting in some cases.  Still, he said, it would have been reasonable to expect a reduction in the frequency of late stenting.  “While the debate on health care reform is ongoing, health care expenditures in the United States are continuing to escalate,” Moscucci said.  “Thus we must heed the call to professional responsibility aimed at the elimination of tests and treatments that do not result in any benefit for our patients, and for which the net effect will be added costs, waste, and possible harm.”  Another study in the same journal, published Monday along with Hochman’s report, shows it is not uncommon to see new and better research challenge established conventions and treatments.  In that study, as many as 16 of the reports that appeared in 2009 in the New England Journal of Medicine, a leading medical publication, contradicted current practice.  But according to Hochman, getting doctors to drop a new treatment may be harder than getting them to take it up — whether that’s due to strongly held beliefs about its effectiveness, worries about medical liability or losing money, or patient expectations.  “We need a lot of changes in the system to control cost and this is just one example,” she said.

9,JNJ,Groups convince FDA to ease Alzheimer's trial rules,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Academic and industry experts said on Tuesday they have convinced U.S. regulators to ease safety restrictions imposed on clinical trials of Alzheimer’s drugs, a move that could improve the chances that a drug being developed jointly by Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson might succeed.  A 2008 study of 240 patients testing that drug, known as bapineuzumab, found a dozen cases of a brain swelling condition called vasogenic edema, shaking confidence in the safety of agents that reduce levels of a protein called beta amyloid that accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients.  That study prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to issue stricter safety guidelines for clinical trials of drugs that alter amyloid in the brain, Maria Carrillo of the Alzheimer’s Association said in a telephone interview.  The guidelines restricted patients in the trials to having no more than two incidents of cerebral microhemmorhages, or tiny leaks of blood in the brain, before they enter a study. They also called for frequent MRI scans to check for brain swelling or other problems that might be caused by the study drugs, Carrillo said.  Under new guidelines ironed out through the Alzheimer’s Association’s Research Roundtable — which included both industry and academic researchers — the FDA has now eased those guidelines, Carrillo said in a telephone interview.  Many companies, including Pfizer and J&J and Eli Lilly, are working to develop drugs that reduce levels of this protein.  Carrillo said the new guidelines — based on the latest research — recognize that many patients with Alzheimer’s disease have had these types of brain events, and excluding so many people from clinical trials would make it more difficult to find effective drugs.  “We were able to bring together all of the literature involved in the discussion of MRI abnormalities that could occur when you are aging with Alzheimer’s disease and when you are participating in clinical trials with an amyloid-modifying agent.”  Carrillo said the group of industry experts and researchers submitted their report to the FDA, which has adopted the new recommendations. The report was published on Tuesday in the journal Alzheimer’s and Dementia.  The new guidelines allow some patients who develop brain swelling to stay in clinical trials, she said.  “We don’t want to compromise safety, but we also want to make sure as many people as possible can participate in Alzheimer’s clinical trials,” Carrillo said.  In January, Eli Lilly said one patient in ongoing trials of the company’s drug solanezumab temporarily developed brain swelling, although it was not clear whether the patient was taking the Lilly drug or a placebo. The problem was not seen in a follow-up brain scan and the patient resumed treatment.  Rachel Schindler, an Alzheimer’s disease expert at Pfizer who worked on the study and wrote an editorial in the journal, said, “broadening the restrictions would allow a better understanding of the potential risks and benefits of amyloid-lowering treatment.”  In May, J&J said it plans to seek U.S. regulatory approval for bapineuzumab in 2012 or 2013, but analysts have said more studies may be needed because of issues with brain swelling.  Currently, there are no drugs that alter the course of Alzheimer’s, which affects 26 million people globally and costs more than $600 billion a year to treat.

11,JNJ,Gilead kickstarts patent pool for AIDS drugs,"LONDON (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences, the leading maker of HIV drugs, is to share intellectual property rights on its medicines in a patent pool designed to make treatments more widely available to the poor.  The California-based group is the first drugmaker to sign up to the new Medicines Patent Pool, whose organizers now expect other major pharmaceutical manufacturers to join the initiative.  Ellen ‘t Hoen, the pool’s executive director, told Reuters she was negotiating terms for similar deals with ViiV Healthcare — a GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer joint venture — as well as with Bristol-Myers Squibb, Roche, Boehringer Ingelheim and Sequoia Pharmaceuticals.  “This is not just a one-off. The whole field is changing ... there will be more to follow,” she said.  Around 33 million people worldwide have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Most live in Africa and Asia, where medicines have to be very cheap to allow those who need them to be able to afford them.  The Medicines Patent Pool, launched by the UNITAID health financing system that is funded by a tax on airline tickets, aims to address this problem by creating a system for patent holders to license technology to makers of cheap generics in exchange for modest royalties.  In the case of Gilead, the agreement allows for the production of generic copies of tenofovir, emtricitabine, cobicistat and elvitegravir, as well as a combination of these products in a single HIV pill known as the “Quad.”  Significantly, cobicistat, elvitegravir and the Quad are still in clinical development, and their inclusion in the deal should speed the flow of new treatments in poor countries.  “Through systematic licensing of intellectual property related to HIV products, people in developing countries will have access to low-cost versions of those products almost at the same time that people in rich countries do,” ‘t Hoen said.  Traditionally, patients in developing countries have to wait for years before they can get access to new drugs.  Gilead will receive a 3 percent royalty on generic sales of tenofovir, which is also approved for use in hepatitis B, and 5 percent on the other products.  The licenses will allow for the supply of tenofovir and emtricitabine in 111 countries, for cobicistat in 102 countries, and for elvitegravir and the Quad in 99 countries.  Assuming other companies come on board, the patent pool could save poor countries more than $1 billion a year in drug costs.  But the revenue stream to Gilead and other patent holders is likely to be small, since generic drug prices in Africa could be just 1 or 2 percent of those in high-income countries.  The decision by Gilead and others to work with UNITAID on the new patent pool marks an evolution in thinking by Big Pharma toward the thorny problem of drug access in the developing world.  Ten years ago, the world’s pharmaceutical industry took a very different stance when it sued South Africa over legislation that was passed by former President Nelson Mandela and which favored generics.  That battle proved a public relations disaster, and since then individual companies have struck a series of voluntary licensing deals, allowing generic copies of HIV products on a case-by-case basis.  The patent pool system, however, goes beyond this by providing an effective “one-stop shop” for generic firms to secure rights to manufacture patent-protected drugs.  The U.S. National Institutes of Health became the first organization to sign up to the pool last September. The concept has been harder for some drugmakers to swallow.  ViiV, for example, was initially unwilling to consider pooling its patents — and Abbott Laboratories, Merck & Co and Johnson & Johnson have yet to enter formal negotiations, although ‘t Hoen said her team was now discussing the idea with all three companies.

12,JNJ,Groups convince FDA to ease Alzheimer's trial rules," * Groups say new guidelines may make drug trials easier   * Findings may improve odds for J&J/Pfizer drug   By Julie Steenhuysen   CHICAGO, July 12 (Reuters) - Academic and industry experts said on Tuesday they have convinced U.S. regulators to ease safety restrictions imposed on clinical trials of Alzheimer’s drugs, a move that could improve the chances that a drug being developed jointly by Pfizer (PFE.N) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) might succeed.   A 2008 study of 240 patients testing that drug, known as bapineuzumab, found a dozen cases of a brain swelling condition called vasogenic edema, shaking confidence in the safety of agents that reduce levels of a protein called beta amyloid that accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients.   That study prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to issue stricter safety guidelines for clinical trials of drugs that alter amyloid in the brain, Maria Carrillo of the Alzheimer’s Association said in a telephone interview.   The guidelines restricted patients in the trials to having no more than two incidents of cerebral microhemmorhages, or tiny leaks of blood in the brain, before they enter a study. They also called for frequent MRI scans to check for brain swelling or other problems that might be caused by the study drugs, Carrillo said.   Under new guidelines ironed out through the Alzheimer’s Association’s Research Roundtable — which included both industry and academic researchers — the FDA has now eased those guidelines, Carrillo said in a telephone interview.   Many companies, including Pfizer and J&J and Eli Lilly (LLY.N), are working to develop drugs that reduce levels of this protein.   Carrillo said the new guidelines — based on the latest research — recognize that many patients with Alzheimer’s disease have had these types of brain events, and excluding so many people from clinical trials would make it more difficult to find effective drugs.   “We were able to bring together all of the literature involved in the discussion of MRI abnormalities that could occur when you are aging with Alzheimer’s disease and when you are participating in clinical trials with an amyloid-modifying agent.”   Carrillo said the group of industry experts and researchers submitted their report to the FDA, which has adopted the new recommendations. The report was published on Tuesday in the journal Alzheimer’s and Dementia.   The new guidelines allow some patients who develop brain swelling to stay in clinical trials, she said.   “We don’t want to compromise safety, but we also want to make sure as many people as possible can participate in Alzheimer’s clinical trials,” Carrillo said.   In January, Eli Lilly said one patient in ongoing trials of the company’s drug solanezumab temporarily developed brain swelling, although it was not clear whether the patient was taking the Lilly drug or a placebo. The problem was not seen in a follow-up brain scan and the patient resumed treatment. [ID:nN11165854]   Rachel Schindler, an Alzheimer’s disease expert at Pfizer who worked on the study and wrote an editorial in the journal, said, “broadening the restrictions would allow a better understanding of the potential risks and benefits of amyloid-lowering treatment.”   In May, J&J said it plans to seek U.S. regulatory approval for bapineuzumab in 2012 or 2013, but analysts have said more studies may be needed because of issues with brain swelling.   Currently, there are no drugs that alter the course of Alzheimer’s, which affects 26 million people globally and costs more than $600 billion a year to treat.

15,JNJ,UPDATE 3-Valeant aims to become top player in skincare,"   * To pay $345 mln for Janssen skincare business   * Follows $425 mln deal for Dermik   * Shares up 4 percent in Toronto  (Adds comments from CEO interview, updates shares; in U.S. dollars unless noted)   By S. John Tilak   TORONTO, July 15 (Reuters) - Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO) (VRX.N) wants to become the world’s biggest player in the skincare sector in about five years, its top executive told Reuters on Friday.   The company has been signaling its intent with a string of recent mid-sized acquisitions in the highly fragmented but lucrative dermatology sector.   The specialty drugmaker said on Friday it will pay $345 million to buy the skincare unit of Johnson & Johnson-owned (JNJ.N) Janssen Pharmaceuticals.   The news sent the Valeant’s shares up 4 percent.   It was the second such deal for Valeant this week. The other was its planned $425 million acquisition of Sanofi’s (SASY.PA) Dermik skincare business. Both deals were with large pharmaceutical companies eager to offload non-core assets.   Valeant, which has about 5 percent of the $20 billion market, plans to continue making deals in dermatology as it looks to reach the top faster, Chief Executive Michael Pearson said. When the recent deals close, the company will record about $1 billion in revenue from dermatology.   “We’re ambitious in many ways. We just want to be a lot bigger than anyone else,” he said in an interview.   While there is significant competition in the dermatology arena, Valeant will be facing smaller rivals, rather than the pharmaceutical giants, which have been beating a hasty retreat from the sector as they look to narrow their focus.   “It’s like we’re in the lightweight division and we’re fighting other lightweights. We’re not fighting heavyweights,” Pearson said. “It fits us from a scale standpoint.”   Pearson’s philosophy has been to stay clear of the so-called Big Pharma companies, but engage in partnerships with them instead.   Valeant’s main rivals in the industry are Medicis Pharmaceuticals MRX.N, Allergan Inc (AGN.N), as well as Stiefel Laboratories Inc, which is a unit of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L).   Since it dropped a $5.7 billion bid for U.S. drugmaker Cephalon Inc CEPH.O in May, there has been speculation that Valeant would go after other large targets. In the same month, the company said it would buy Lithuanian group Sanitas SAN1L.VL for about 314 million euros ($443 million).   The company is still considering larger takeovers and can pull off a $6 billion deal, Pearson said.   “Europe is probably lower in the list right now” because of the two recent sizable deals there, Pearson said. The company could look at regions such as Latin America and Australia, he added.   Mississauga, Ontario-based Valeant, which focuses on the neurology and dermatology markets, expects Friday’s deal to add to its earnings in 2011.   “They’re out there buying assets for cash flow and building a broad dermatology presence. It seems like a pretty sound strategy to me,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Annabel Samimy said.   “The assets that they’re buying are not necessarily the ones that require a significant amount of promotion or expense behind them,” she added.   Revenue for the Janssen product portfolio, which includes prescription brands Retin-A Micro, Ertaczo and Renova, was about $150 million in 2010.   Valeant’s shares were up 4 percent at C$52.47 in Toronto, and up 4.4 percent at $54.94 in New York.

17,JNJ,Novartis Q2 margins in focus as key drugs rivalled," * Novartis core EPS seen jumping 27 pct   * Seen boosted by Alcon buy   * Eyes on newest products   * Diovan, Femara facing generic competition    ZURICH, July 19 (Reuters) - Investors will focus on Novartis’ margins for clues as to whether its newest drugs are helping stem sales losses of key medicines, when it kicks off the big pharma earnings season on Tuesday.	   The Swiss drugmaker is expected to report a 27 percent jump in core earnings per share, boosted by its $51 billion buy of eyecare group Alcon, and by demand for its generic version of Sanofi’s blood-thinner Lovenox. 	   Novartis is counting on sales of its newer treatments to help offset lower sales of key drugs such as Diovan for blood pressure and Femara for cancer, which face generic competition.	   The Basel-based group has a better track record than most rivals in bringing new drugs to market, and analysts will be keen to see how its latest products, such as recently launched multiple sclerosis pill Gilenya, are faring.	   “The first few weeks of generic impact for Femara may hurt pharma growth and margins slightly,” analysts at UniCredit said in a note. “Also, look for indicators of sales ramps for key growth drivers Tasigna, Onbrez, Afinitor and Gilenya.”	   On the other side of the Atlantic, investors will focus on the newest medicines at Johnson & Johnson when the diversified healthcare group posts its second-quarter results a few hours after Novartis.	   Investors are hopeful drugs such as Zytiga and Edurant will revive J&J’s long-underperforming pharmaceuticals business.	   Novartis, which trades at a slight premium to cross-town rival Roche , has seen its shares fall more than 8 percent this year, against a 7 percent rise in the European healthcare index , and some say this is unjustified. 	   “A string of positive R&D newsflow hardly appears reflected in recent performance, whilst conglomerisation concerns look tied to overly bearish views on Alcon,” analysts at Collins Stewart said in a note.	   Recent positive data for cancer drug Afinitor, tipped by some to become a multi-billion dollar seller has, however, helped reassure some analysts that Novartis can cushion its patent cliff drop, while others are turning more optimistic about its respiratory pipeline.

18,JNJ,Exclusive: GE to soon seek FDA OK for Alzheimer's imaging agent,"PARIS (Reuters) - General Electric Co is finishing clinical trials for an agent designed to detect early signs of Alzheimer’s and expects to seek regulatory approval by year’s end, its executive leading the process said.  GE, Eli Lilly and Co and Bayer AG are all developing similar compounds, which stick to amyloid plaques in the brain and light up on positron emission tomography or PET scans. If approved, the compounds will be used to help doctors rule out Alzheimer’s in people.  Lilly unit Avid Radiopharmaceuticals was first to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for its tracer, called florbetapir or Amyvid, but was dealt a setback when the agency said it should develop training programs to ensure the tests are read in a consistent manner.  Jonathan Allis, general manager of PET Medical Diagnostics at GE Healthcare, told Reuters that his team plans to learn from the mistakes of its competitors.  In an exclusive interview at the Alzheimer’s Association’s International Conference in Paris, Allis described what he called a long game in identifying and treating the brain-wasting disease.  “I think our data is very good. It’s tight. We’re close to filing (for approval),” Allis said of GE’s imaging agent, called flutemetamol.  “They (Avid) did a great job, but I think we did the boring stuff better,” he said, referring to the company’s extensive work on manufacturing, imaging quality and image analysis.  Radioactive tracers that test for fragments of beta-amyloid plaque are seen as a critical bridge in the search for effective drugs to treat Alzheimer’s, a fatal, mind-robbing disease that affects nearly 36 million people worldwide.  Scientists believe these Alzheimer’s-linked plaques start developing at least a decade before symptoms occur, and spotting those changes in the brain early offers the best chance to intervene with new drugs that might prevent or delay the disease.  Once they win approval for their products, GE, Lilly and Bayer will compete for market share. To gain an edge, GE is developing a software program to help analyze the flutemetamol scans, and it is developing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to measure brain volume, which also changes as Alzheimer’s advances.  “By the time we launch next year, we’ll launch the MRI images and combine the two together,” Allis said.  Allis said GE has a growing interest in addressing Alzheimer’s, a disease that is expected to affect as many as 115 million people by 2050 unless effective treatments are found.  “There is a huge interest in Alzheimer’s and it goes right to the top of GE,” Allis said, referring to GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt, who once headed GE Healthcare Systems.  Besides amyloid imaging, GE plans to build on a partnership with Johnson & Johnson announced last December to search for other changes in the body that can be used to develop biomarker tests for Alzheimer’s.  “That is the start of what we hope to be a much broader relationship with J&J in Alzheimer’s disease,” Allis said.  Allis says finding earlier ways to identify Alzheimer’s patients is going to be critical as drug companies such as Lilly, Pfizer Inc and J&J look to test new agents that will stop the disease before it does too much damage.  Current medications treat Alzheimer’s symptoms but cannot change the course of the disease, and new drugs that have been tried so far have failed, in large part, experts think, because they were tried only when the disease was too advanced.  “If you look at all the pharmaceutical trials now, they are all in probably the wrong patient group. They are too late,” Allis said.  Amyloid imaging agents are already being commonly used to help drug companies identify people with amyloid in their brain who might be a good candidates for drug trials.  Allis said GE and J&J are trying to identify screening tests for the disease that can be used in a wider population, in much the same way people are tested for early signs of prostate cancer.  “It’s a long game. I think we are not anywhere near the end,” he said.  ",7182011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-alzheimers-ge/exclusive-ge-to-soon-seek-fda-ok-for-alzheimers-imaging-agent-idUSTRE76H5OZ20110718
19,JNJ,Brain swelling may be common with Alzheimer's drugs,"PARIS (Reuters) - Three patients treated with an experimental Bristol-Myers Squibb Alzheimer’s drug have developed a type of brain swelling known as vasogenic edema, but the side effect may be common in Alzheimer’s patients, researchers said on Monday.  Vasogenic edema may even be a sign that drugs are clearing a protein tied to Alzheimer’s from the brain, researchers said at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Paris.  The results could have bearing on the closely watched drug bapineuzumab, being developed by Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson. Vasogenic edema became a major concern after a 2008 mid-stage study of 240 patients on bapineuzumab found a dozen cases.  But while previous cases of swelling were seen in drugs that use antibodies to remove clumps of the Alzheimer’s-related protein beta amyloid from the brain, the Bristol drug BMS-708163 is a gamma-secretase inhibitor that targets the disease with a different mechanism.  “No one had thought this was likely in a trial of a gamma-secretase inhibitor,” Dr. Reisa Sperling of Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston told the meeting. She added that the presence of the effect in different classes of drugs showed the side effect may be more common than previously thought.  Sperling said the side effect may be related to the clearing of amyloid from the brain, or it may be these side effects occur spontaneously in patients with Alzheimer’s.  Although vasogenic edema was visible on brain scans, none of the patients in the Bristol-Myers study had clinical symptoms and all three had a mutation in the APOE4 gene which raises the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  One of the three patients had signs of brain swelling at the beginning of the study, and Sperling said brain scans showed that patient’s condition continued to worsen over the course of the six-month study.  “Whether the treatment increased it, I don’t know,” she said in an interview.  The field of Alzheimer’s research is littered with drug failures, providing little hope to the nearly 36 million people who suffer from it worldwide. Eli Lilly and Co last year halted two studies of its gamma-secretase drug, called semagacestat, after it worsened patients’ symptoms of dementia in late-stage clinical trials.  In January, Lilly said one patient in an ongoing trial of its antibody drug solanezumab temporarily developed vasogenic edema, although it was not clear whether the patient was taking the Lilly drug or a placebo.  Concerns over the bapineuzumab study in 2008 prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to issue stricter safety guidelines for clinical trials of drugs that alter amyloid in the brain.  But researchers said last week the FDA agreed to modify those restrictions after a year-long study that showed these types of events may be common in people with Alzheimer’s disease.

22,JNJ,Novartis new drugs help fight generics threat,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis NOVN.VX expects to withstand competition from cheaper copies of its drugs after it posted forecast-beating second-quarter sales helped by its newest products.  Novartis, which has a better track record than most rivals in bringing new drugs to market, hit an upbeat note on Tuesday about its recently launched multiple sclerosis pill Gilenya, which raked in $79 million from April to June.  “Gilenya is turning out to be one of the most successful new product launches,” Chief Executive Joe Jimenez told reporters.  The group also said sales of Tasigna, which is being billed as a replacement for older drug Glivec to treat a life-threatening type of blood cancer, rose 79 percent, while demand for eye drug Lucentis was also strong.  Sales rose 27 percent, or 19 percent in constant currencies, to $14.9 billion, ahead of a poll average of $14.7 billion, while sales volume at the key pharma unit rose 8 percent.  Like many other drugmakers, Novartis is starting to face generic competition as its breast cancer drug Femara and its blood pressure medicine Diovan lose patent protection.  But the group’s newest products as well as its diversified strategy mean Novartis is well placed to deal with the looming patent cliff.  In an interview with Reuters Insider television, Jimenez said the drugmaker’s recent $51 billion buy of eyecare group Alcon as well its Sandoz unit, which itself makes generic drugs, would also allow Novartis to navigate the loss of patents.  Sales of Diovan slipped 3 percent to $1.5 billion, but Novartis said the drug has held on to its position as the top-selling branded anti-hypertensive medication in the world. Femara sales tumbled 29 percent.  “I do expect, because we have a broad portfolio across many geographies and many different segments of healthcare, to be able to fully compensate for patent expiration going forward,” Jimenez said in the interview.  Novartis shares, which have underperformed the sector so far this year, were up 3.7 percent at 1007 GMT, outperforming a 0.3 percent rise in the European healthcare index .SXDP.  “This is a solid result that should provide investors with confidence in Novartis’ abilities to manage its upcoming patent hits through both new product growth and underlying productivity improvements,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.  On the other side of the Atlantic, investors will also focus on the newest medicines at Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) when the diversified healthcare group posts its second-quarter results later on Tuesday.  Investors are hopeful that drugs like Zytiga and Edurant will revive J&J’s long-underperforming pharmaceuticals business.  Novartis, which kicked off the big pharma earnings season with a 23 percent rise in second quarter core earnings per share to $1.48, also confirmed its full-year guidance.  It expects group sales to grow around the double-digit mark in constant currencies and sees volume growth in its pharma unit in the low- to mid-single digit range, while its core operating margin in constant currencies should also improve.  Novartis, which has trimmed jobs as part of a cost-cutting drive, saw its core operating margin rise 0.4 percentage points year-on-year to 28.4 percent in the second quarter despite the sharp rise in the Swiss franc.  Jimenez said Basel-based Novartis would not be passive in the face of the strong franc, which has shot from one record to another against the euro and the dollar this year.  “We have to look at ways to better align our cost base with our revenue base. That means reducing our costs in Switzerland and better aligning them with euro land and also with the U.S. dollar,” Jimenez told Reuters Insider.  “We will not be victims. We are going to take action to make sure we that we can offset the effect of the currency,” he said, adding this could include measures such as buying raw materials and goods and services in euros or dollars for its Swiss site.  Investors will eye results from cross-town rival Roche ROG.VX on Thursday, as well as earnings from Swiss biotech group Actelion ATLN.VX, for more insight into how the franc is impacting Swiss players.

25,JNJ,"J&J; beats profit forecast, sticks to full-year view","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) reported better-than-expected earnings due to a turnaround for its prescription medicines and stabilizing sales of over-the-counter medicines that have been repeatedly recalled in the past two years due to quality control lapses.  Results were also greatly helped by the weaker dollar, which boosts the value of sales in overseas markets, and sharply lower taxes.  The diversified healthcare company on Tuesday said it had net earnings in the second quarter of $2.78 billion, or $1.00 per share, compared with $3.45 billion, or $1.23 per share, in the year-earlier period.  Excluding special items, J&J earned $1.28 per share — topping the average forecast of $1.24 per share among analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Company sales jumped 8.3 percent to $16.6 billion, surpassing Wall Street’s expectations of $16.23 billion. Sales would have risen only 2.6 percent if not for the weaker dollar.  Despite the profit and sales beats in the quarter, J&J stuck to its full-year profit view of $4.90 to $5 per share. That would reflect growth of up to 5 percent from last year’s results.  Global sales of prescription drugs jumped 12.2 percent to $6.23 billion.  Sales of consumer products, including over-the-counter drugs, rose 4 percent to $3.79 billion.  The company said it was the first time its consumer medicines have scored sales gains since early 2010. Many of J&J’s best-known brands, including Tylenol and Motrin painkillers and Rolaids antacid, have been frequently recalled since late 2009 due to quality-control lapses at three plants in the United States and Puerto Rico.  J&J’s other major business, medical devices and diagnostics, saw sales rise 7.2 percent to $6.57 billion. Strong demand for surgical-care products, diabetes-care brands and contact lenses offset lower sales of J&J’s stents used to prop open heart arteries that have been cleared of plaque.  J&J last month said it will stop selling drug-coated heart stents, a former profit driver for the company that has stumbled due to safety concerns and fierce competition.  It said it would end development of its Nevo heart stent and stop making its Cypher stent, ceding the field to Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and Medtronic Inc (MDT.N). J&J will continue, however, to sell its far less-lucrative bare metal stents.  Shares of J&J were up 11 cents at $67.20 in premarket trading, from Monday’s closing price of $67.09 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The shares of the world’s largest software company have risen 10 percent over the past month — outpacing the tech-heavy Nasdaq — but still are perched in the mid-$20 range, a level they have circled since 1998, adjusted for splits.   “There’s just not enough growth there to make people interested,” said Michael Yoshikami, Chief Executive of fund manager YCMNET Advisors. “It’s the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) of technology. A large, cash flow-oriented company, but explosive growth has probably passed it by the wayside.”   Microsoft’s fourth-quarter sales are expected to push annual revenue close to $70 billion for the first time on Thursday, slightly more than Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) last fiscal year. It is also on track for a best-ever $22 billion in net profit for the 2011 fiscal year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Microsoft had net income of $18.76 billion last year year.   But records are not enough for investors, who are more focused on a post-PC future driven by Internet-focused services and mobile gadgets from Apple, Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Facebook.   Analysts expect Apple's revenue to be twice Microsoft's by fiscal 2014, from relative parity now. (For an interactive graphic comparing major tech firms, click on r.reuters.com/nuw62s)   Microsoft’s sales grew 12-fold between 1991     and 2000, whereas they grew by only two and a half times between 2001 and 2010.   “We have concerns about Microsoft,” said Bruce Ventimiglia, Chief Executive Officer at fund manager Saratoga Capital Management. “As we look at Google and others attacking their business lines, our view over the long run is that it’s going to erode margins. Microsoft is not moving as forcefully in the tech space as we’d like to see.”   Microsoft’s most immediate problem is faltering growth in sales of PCs, which generally come pre-loaded with the Windows operating system and are the surest guide to the company’s financial health.   PC sales grew only 2.3 percent in the second quarter of 2011, according to tech research firm Gartner, well below its earlier projection for 6.7 percent growth, as economic uncertainty hangs over consumers and Apple’s iPad and other tablets take off.   Microsoft said last week it has now sold more than 400 million Windows licenses since launch in October 2009, up from 350 million three months ago. That suggests 50 million Windows sales in the quarter, about the number it sold the quarter before that.   Windows 7, while still popular with consumers, has already become old news for investors eyeing ‘Windows 8’ — the provisional name for the next tablet-friendly operating system expected late next year.   Microsoft has been showing off early prototypes of the new system — which borrow the look and feel from its mobile platform — but is not expected to reveal any new details until its annual developer conference in September.   But some are tired of waiting. In May, outspoken hedge fund manager and long-time Microsoft shareholder David Einhorn called for the removal of Chief Executive Steve Ballmer and a sale of its money-losing online services unit to revive the stock. [ID:nN25183623]   In the last week, a June-dated letter from an anonymous investor to Microsoft’s lead independent director has been widely circulated, calling for the company to issue $40 billion of debt to fund a massive share buyback and to direct all its domestic cash flow toward paying dividends.   Microsoft, which has not always had easy relations with investors, has shown no indication it is considering any of these courses of action.   Ballmer and his executives say they are making the right moves — cutting a deal to put Microsoft software on Nokia NOK1V.HE phones, agreeing to buy online video-chat company Skype, making the most of its small investment in Facebook, while hacking away at Google with its Bing search engine.   The company is hoping its efforts will ultimately create a coherent, Internet-compatible whole, spanning operating systems to business software to phones and tablets.   Investors are not buying it so far. The stock now trades at 9.7 times analysts’ estimates of earnings for the next 12 months, according to StarMine data, which places greater weight on more accurate analysts. That is around the lowest it has ever been, and lags Apple at 12.6 times and Google at 15.3 times.   “Microsoft certainly has a lot of money and some smart people, but we need to see their investment prowess pay off before we can get excited about it,” said Ventimiglia at Saratoga Capital Management.   Analysts expect fiscal fourth quarter earnings per share for Microsoft of 58 cents, up from 51 cents a share in the year ago period. They expect fourth quarter sales of $17.2 bln, up from $16 bln a year ago.

Novartis, which has a better track record than most rivals in bringing new drugs to market, hit an upbeat note about its recently launched multiple sclerosis pill Gilenya, which raked in $79 million from April to June.        “Gilenya is turning out to be one of the most successful new product launches,” Chief Executive Joe Jimenez told reporters on Tuesday.        Sales at the Basel-based group rose 27 percent, or 19 percent in constant currencies, to $14.9 billion, ahead of a poll average of $14.735 billion, while sales volume at the key pharma unit rose 8 percent. 	   Novartis, like many other drugmakers, is starting to face generic competition as cancer drug Femara and its blood pressure medicine Diovan lose patent protection.	   But Jimenez told Reuters Insider television that Novartis’ recent $51 billion buy of eyecare group Alcon as well its Sandoz unit, which itself makes generic drugs, would allow Novartis to navigate the loss of patents.	   Sales of Diovan slipped 3 percent to $1.5 billion, but Novartis said the drug has held on to its position as the top-selling branded anti-hypertensive medication in the world. Femara sales tumbled 29 percent.        “I do expect because we have a broad portfolio quote across many geographies and many different segments of healthcare to be able to fully compensate for patent expiration going forward,” Jimenez said in the interview.	   Novartis shares, which have underperformed the sector so far this year, were up 2.6 percent at 0701 GMT, outperforming a 0.4 percent rise on the European healthcare index    	   Novartis’ core earnings per share rose 23 percent to $1.48 in the second quarter.	   “Overall a good set of results which just beat consensus expectations at both the top and bottom lines and importantly is delivering on the promised margin improvement. Gilenya is also continuing to see a good launch,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note.	   The group said sales of Tasigna, which is being billed as a replacement for older drug Glivec in chronic myeloid leukaemia, rose 79 percent, while demand for eye drug Lucentis was also strong.	   Novartis confirmed its full-year guidance and is eyeing group constant currency sales growth around the double-digit mark and volume growth in its pharma unit in the low- to mid-single digit range.	   The group also expects to improve constant currency core operating margin, and this rose 0.4 percentage points year-on-year to 28.4 percent in the second quarter.	  On the other side of the Atlantic, investors will also focus on the newest medicines at Johnson & Johnson when the diversified healthcare group posts its second-quarter results in a few hours.	   Investors are hopeful that drugs like Zytiga and Edurant will revive J&J’s long-underperforming pharmaceuticals business.

31,JNJ,"Special report: With Alzheimer's in the genes, when do you test?","PARIS (Reuters) - As a boy, Gary Reiswig would take his grandfather by the hand and guide him on walks around the family farm in western Oklahoma.  At 5, Gary knew to avoid the prairie dog town, fearful that his grandfather might stumble over one of the holes that the rodents burrowed into the grassy plain.  Occasionally, his grandfather would stop. His eyes took on an eerie stare that spoke of an empty place — one that once was filled with memories, laughter and toil.  In 1945, nobody knew that Gary’s grandfather had a rare form of Alzheimer’s disease that would strike 10 of Gary’s 14 aunts and uncles, his father and his only brother and sister in the prime of their lives.  Gary’s family has dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s disease. It is rare, and it afflicts the young. In his family, symptoms can appear in the early 40s.  This inherited form of Alzheimer’s is caused by mutations in one of three genes: amyloid precursor protein, presenilin 1 or presenilin 2. It is the only form of Alzheimer’s for which there is a diagnostic test that can predict with certainty whether Alzheimer’s will ensue.  That may change. Researchers, patient advocates and policy makers are pushing for earlier testing of Alzheimer’s, in part because it will help the search for a cure. That means more people could find out if they will succumb to the disease.  But without a treatment or a cure, would people want to know?  Surprisingly, yes, said Dr. Robert Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health.  Blendon conducted a survey of 2,678 adults from five countries that was released on Wednesday at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Paris. About two thirds of respondents said they were likely to get a test to predict whether they would get Alzheimer’s before any symptoms appeared.  Some 35.6 million people worldwide have Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia. Drugs only help symptoms; none can arrest Alzheimer’s, which costs $604 billion a year globally to treat.  All of the drugs that have been tried in people with advanced dementia have failed to slow the disease, and many experts think the reason is that they were tried on people who were too far gone.  Some people who know Alzheimer’s may lie in wait make different life choices. They take more extravagant vacations, they put their finances in order earlier than many other people. They even may use a surrogate parent instead of taking a chance of passing on the disease to a new generation.  There are no tests that can detect Alzheimer’s before symptoms appear, but researchers are getting closer.  Eli Lilly and Co is seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to sell an Alzheimer’s imaging agent for use with positron emission tomography, or PET, scans to help doctors rule out Alzheimer’s.  In January, an advisory panel to the FDA said it would consider approving the compound, but it wants the company to develop a training program to ensure radiologists can read brain scans using the compound consistently.  Lilly acquired the drug through its recent purchase of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals Inc, which has been leading a three-way race for such imaging agents with General Electric Co and Bayer AG.  The agents could have a potential global market of anywhere from $1 billion to $5 billion, according to these companies.  Scientists are also looking for signals of Alzheimer’s in cerebrospinal fluid. These tests look for two Alzheimer’s-related proteins: beta amyloid, which forms sticky plaques in the brain, and tau, a marker of cell damage. Low levels of beta amyloid in spinal fluid suggest it may be accumulating in the brain, and high tau levels suggest nerve cell death.  Some doctors already test for this to confirm that Alzheimer’s has caused a person’s dementia.  Encouraged by these steps, National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, and the Alzheimer’s Association in April revised the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer’s for the first time in 27 years to recognize mild cognitive impairment as a precursor to the disease.  They also added a new research category called preclinical Alzheimer’s, the earliest stage of the disease when clumps of amyloid start to form in the brains of people who are otherwise healthy.  This stage, which occurs some 10 years before dementia sets in, is seen as the best place to intervene. It is why new imaging agents for PET scans, spinal fluid tests and so-called biomarkers that predict Alzheimer’s are becoming so important to researchers and drug companies.  “The guidelines portend a lot more than just how to diagnose Alzheimer’s today,” said Dr. Daniel Skovronsky, founder and chief executive of Avid Radiopharmaceuticals.  “I think many people now have a sense of hope that some day we can make Alzheimer’s a preventable disease, and that is through early prevention and early treatment,” he said.  Gary was 25 when he found out his father had Alzheimer’s, and he lived with the possibility that he might develop the disease until he was 57. That is when he learned he did not inherit the gene.  His family already saw the grim results of the disease. Gary’s grandfather, at age 53, veered into the path of a freight train in 1936. The accident killed his grandmother; his grandfather survived with a few stitches and lived another 10 years.  “My family attributed his disease and forgetfulness to his grief over this accident,” Gary said. It was only later, when the next generation began to suffer the same symptoms, that one of his aunts began to suspect something was terribly wrong.  Gary’s family and 11 other North American families have mutations in the presenilin 2 gene. They are descendants of Germans who settled in two villages in the Volga region of Russia in the 1760s, and later settled in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Their disease is autosomal dominant, meaning children only need to get one abnormal gene from either parent to inherit the disease, and each child has a 50/50 chance of getting it.  This form of Alzheimer’s comprises about 1 percent of the cases of Alzheimer’s worldwide.  “If you have that mutation, so far as we know, you will in fact get that disease,” Gary said.  And because of that guarantee, Gary’s family and others may soon lead the way to a cure for the disease.  A clinical trial known as the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer’s Network, or DIAN, is studying families with inherited forms of Alzheimer’s to learn more about how the disease progresses.  Funded by a grant from the National Institute on Aging in 2008, DIAN has the largest and most extensive worldwide research network investigating dominantly inherited Alzheimer’s, with sites in the United States, Britain and Australia.  Initial results from the study presented at the Alzheimer’s Association meeting suggest inherited forms of the disease can be detected as many as 20 years before problems with memory and thinking develop.  They found that, as with people with more common Alzheimer’s, people who develop early onset disease experience a drop in amyloid in their spinal fluid and an increase in tau some 20 years before their symptoms appear.  The findings suggest that there is a common pathway between inherited Alzheimer’s and late-onset Alzheimer’s, said Dr. Randall Bateman of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who is an associate director of the study.  “That is the pathway we want to treat. If we can interfere with that, we can hopefully prevent Alzheimer’s disease,” he said.  Drug companies are being selected to test their experimental medicines on these study volunteers because if they have the gene, they are certain to get Alzheimer’s.  “It’s a huge opportunity,” said Dr. Rachel Schindler, an Alzheimer’s disease expert at Pfizer Inc, which is developing the drug bapineuzumab with Johnson & Johnson, which is now in late-stage clinical trials.  “It’s a window into how early we really can detect the changes related to Alzheimer’s disease. Without that window, you’d have to study hundreds of people over a long period of time because only a few of them would end up developing the disease,” Schindler said.  If scientists can understand the disease, they can apply much of what they learn to late-onset Alzheimer’s, she said.  People in the study are eager to participate in the drug trials, Bateman said. “They are desperate to have treatments for their families.”  Marty Reiswig, a 32-year-old minister living near Denver, found out about the study from his brother Matt. Matt told Marty that he had to read a book about the family’s disease by Gary Reiswig — their father’s cousin.  After reading the book, “The Thousand Mile Stare: One Family’s Journey through the Struggle and Science of Alzheimer’s,” the brothers agreed that their family would make perfect “lab rats,” Marty said.  That is because people in his family, unlike most people who get Alzheimer’s, know it’s coming, he said.  Marty undergoes annual lumbar punctures to have his spinal fluid checked for levels of amyloid and tau — the proteins that help predict Alzheimer’s progression — and because he has no symptoms, he has a battery of memory tests every three years.  “Because I am a child of an affected early onset Alzheimer’s person, they want to study my mental health progress,” Marty said.  Marty’s and Matt’s father Lawrence is also part of the study.  Marty says he relishes his visits with Dr. Bateman, and loves to pepper him with questions about the study.  In one recent visit, he got some good news.  “I was lying in bed with lumbar puncture in my back, talking to Dr. Bateman,” Marty recalled. “He said, ‘I think some time in the next 12 months, there is a very good possibility we might be doing clinical trials with you to find drugs to prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s.’”  Marty said he lay in the hospital bed and wept.  “My dad was across from me in the hospital room and we had to control ourselves. That this terrible thing could possibly sort of vanish... that was just a huge relief for us.”  “That was thrilling,” said Lawrence, who is 58 and just starting to show signs of Alzheimer’s.  “He is still very functioning, but worsening,” Marty says of his father, who lives in Greeley, Colorado, with his mother Bonnie. “It has most affected his speech.”  Lawrence says it takes about five minutes to get himself a bowl of cold cereal and a spoon in the mornings, largely because he gets distracted so often.  “He has a fantastic attitude. He laughs at himself and allows others to laugh about his mistakes,” Marty said. “Here he is, faced with this cruel, slow ending to his life, and the embarrassment factor is huge.”  When people are in their 90’s and make social gaffes, people tend to excuse them, Marty said. “‘When you make those same social mistakes at age 58, the people who know what is going on give you grace, but everyone else wonders what is wrong with you.’”  Despite all the hope, some doctors and social workers who treat Alzheimer’s and care for their families say the push for early testing is premature.  “The tests are so inaccurate at this point that I don’t know what the value is other than to create a lot of anxiety,” said Debra Greenberg, geriatrics social worker at Montefiore Medical Center in New York.  Greenberg is skeptical of polls showing strong interest in early testing, especially when they are done among people who are young and healthy.  “I think what you decide when you are a healthy and well 40-year-old is very different from what you decide when you are older,” she said. “You are not that 40-year-old when this happens to you.”  Other Alzheimer’s experts see value in early diagnosis.  “We think right now, today, there is a clear benefit of an early diagnosis,” says Bill Thies, chief scientific officer of the Alzheimer’s Association, whose group has been a proponent of early diagnostics for many years.  One reason is that studies suggest people who understand the course of Alzheimer’s disease and what to expect from it cope better with the disease.  “This is true of patients and caregivers,” Thies said.  Thies said an early diagnosis also helps with end-of-life decisions, allowing the patient to plan their care instead of leaving these decisions to others.  It also leaves time for financial planning.  “If you know you’re starting down that path, you know to get your affairs in order. You take care of family issues so it won’t be a big surprise later when it gets worse,” said Dr. Creighton Phelps, director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Center Programs in the National Institute on Aging’s division of neuroscience.  But Blendon of Harvard worries about raising expectations by testing people and not offering treatments.  “For people who are so used to hope that medical science can push the darkness away here, they could be disappointed.”  And there are good reasons not to get tested.  Marty has decided not to find out his gene status. He is afraid that knowing he has the gene might jeopardize his long-term care insurance.  “My wife and I have chosen to live as if I have it anyway,” said Marty, who has a 5-year-old girl and 3-year-old boy.  The decision over whether to have children who could suffer the same genetic risk is especially touchy. Marty said his grandmother Ester, who was instrumental in helping bring the family’s genetic disease to light, urged members of the family not to have children.  “Personally, I’m glad that no one followed that rule,” he said. “I’ve been given a life by my parents and the good Lord. I love my wife. We both knew the genetic risk, but it is a very natural thing — we wanted to have kids and love them and raise them, no matter what their future.”  Every five years, they plan a big vacation. The last one was to Italy.  “I don’t know how long I have. It drives me to seize the day because I could get Alzheimer’s symptoms as early as my mid-40s, and here I am at 32.”  Gary says it is common among the younger members of his family not to get tested. “They say, ‘maybe when I’m 50,’ but I don’t want to know now.”  Gary had no idea of the weight of his burden of living with the threat of Alzheimer’s until the day he found out he did not inherit the gene.  “It was joyous relief. I just wanted to sing. And then, there was just this horrible weight of grief and sadness because of not only my brother and sister, but all of the other members of my family I have seen who have lived through this.”  ",7202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-alzheimers/special-report-with-alzheimers-in-the-genes-when-do-you-test-idUSTRE76J1L020110720

33,JNJ,"Abbott profit buoyed by Humira, emerging markets","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N) reported higher second-quarter profit, fueled by strong sales growth in emerging markets and demand for its Humira arthritis drug.  Net earnings rose 50 percent to $1.94 billion, or $1.23 per share, thanks to a $519 million gain from the resolution of U.S. and international tax issues, the company said on Wednesday.  Excluding special items, profit was $1.12 per share, a penny above the average forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  “It was a solid quarter, but not a blowout quarter. They didn’t blow the numbers away,” said Michael Liss, senior portfolio manager of the American Century Value Fund.  Humira, as usual, was the standout product. Its global sales rose 25 percent to $2 billion despite stiff competition from Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) Remicade and Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) Enbrel. The drugs treat rheumatoid arthritis by blocking a protein called tumor necrosis factor.  “Humira continues to be a huge factor for Abbott and we expect it to keep growing strongly over the next few years,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.  The injectable drug, already one of the world’s top-selling medicines, should eventually capture annual revenue of $11 billion due to its potency and relatively infrequent dosing, Conover said.  Wall Street has grown increasingly concerned, however, that Abbott may have become too dependent on Humira, and that a novel new treatment being developed by Pfizer could pose a big threat to Abbott’s cash cow.  Abbott shares fell 0.9 percent to $52.42 in midday trading, amid a moderate decline for other U.S. drugmakers.  Abbott raised its full-year profit forecast slightly, to between $4.58 and $4.68 per share, based on favorable results so far this year. That would reflect growth of up to 12.2 percent from last year. The suburban Chicago drugmaker previously forecast $4.54 to $4.64 per share.  Global second-quarter sales rose 9 percent to $9.62 billion, a bit higher than Wall Street expectations for $9.57 billion. Sales would have risen only 4.4 percent if not for the weaker dollar, which boosts the value of sales in overseas markets.  Sales in emerging markets jumped 23 percent to $2.59 billion, bolstered by the company’s recent purchase of the generics business of India’s Piramal Healthcare.  Overall pharmaceutical sales rose 13 percent to $2.3 billion, with strong growth in overseas markets and the United States.  By contrast, sales of nutritional products rose just 5.4 percent to $655 million, with half the growth attributable to the weaker dollar.

35,JNJ,"Alzheimer's drug from Pfizer, J&J; may prove safer"," * Brain swelling problem may decrease over time   * Drug well tolerated in long-term study   * Some cases of mild vasogenic edema were undetected   * Studies may build confidence in once-battered drug   By Julie Steenhuysen   PARIS, July 20 (Reuters) - Experimental Alzheimer’s drug bapineuzumab, from Pfizer (PFE.N) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), may be safer than originally thought, according to two studies by U.S. researchers released on Wednesday.   They said that a brain swelling condition called vasogenic edema, which caused a lot of worry over the drug’s safety early on, may decrease over time.   “It looks like we can treat people for a number of years safely,” Dr. Steven Salloway of Butler Hospital and Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, told the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Paris.   Salloway looked at the long-term safety of 194 patients in a mid-stage trial of the drug that stayed on treatment after the initial phase ended. Of those, 86 patients got the drug for at least 3 years and 43 were treated for at least 4 years.   About 24 percent of the patients had side effects possibly related to the drug, and some 85 percent of these were considered mild to moderate.   Cases of vasogenic edema, now called ARIA-E or Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities with Parenchymal Edema, appeared to lessen over time.   The risk of developing ARIA-E dropped from 6.7 percent in the first three infusions of the drug, to 2.7 percent for the fourth through the 10th treatment.   “That is very encouraging to me,” Salloway said in an interview. “I think this is a transient condition.”  “We’ve treated a lot of patients at at our center. I think it is very well tolerated,” he said.   Larger, late-stage clinical trials will be needed to determine whether the drug works. Those studies are expected to stop enrolling patients in mid-2012.   There is no current treatment for Alzheimer’s, which affects nearly 36 million people worldwide.   In a separate study of the drug, a team led by Dr. Reisa Sperling of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston reviewed more than 2,000 MRI scans from 262 patients who participated in mid-stage studies of bapineuzumab.   She looked for cases of amyloid-related abnormalities on the scans that might represent vasogenic edema or tiny leaks in blood vessels.   The radiologists in the study were specifically looking for amyloid abnormalities in the brain that might have gone undetected because patients had no symptoms.   The team found 36 cases thought to be linked to treatment with bapineuzumab, including 15 new cases. None of these patients had symptoms of ARIA-E, which can include headache, memory loss, loss of coordination and disorientation.   Since these cases were not identified, many of these patients continued to be treated with bapineuzumab.   “They were treated through their ARIA and remained asymptomatic,” Sperling said in an interview.   “For me that was reassuring. You see these changes in the MRI and they look a little frightening. The fact that they can potentially be treated and remain OK is reassuring.”   The team also found that people treated with higher doses of bapineuzumab who have an Alzheimer’s risk gene called APOE-4 tend to have more ARIA-E side effects, confirming the companies’ decision to lower the dose of the drug in these patients.   Salloway said the mid-stage study he looked at was not meant to show whether the drug helped improve clinical symptoms, but the researchers were encouraged to see it appears to be safe.   Many researchers think patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease are too far gone to have any significant benefit from drugs like bapineuzumab.   Salloway says he is hopeful the drug will work, but he will not fret if the late-stage results do not improve symptoms.   “I don’t think it would kill the drug or the amyloid hypothesis,” he said. Drugs like bapineuzumab remove deposits of beta amyloid from the brain, on the theory that will help improve memory problems in people with Alzheimer’s disease.   Despite several attempts, no anti-amyloid drug has shown a benefit, but all of them have been tried in people with more advanced disease.   Researchers are now looking for safe ways to test people in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s, in some cases even before symptoms appear.   J&J and Pfizer are developing bapineuzumab jointly. Elan Corp ELN.I, one of the drug’s original developers, still retains a financial stake.

The company had informed doctors last month about a potential shortage of the injectable medicine, made by a unit of German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim.  In a “Dear Healthcare Provider” letter posted this week on the drug’s website, www.doxil.com, J&J confirmed that a shortage indeed now exists and that new supplies of the medicine will not be shipped until late August.  “Supplies may be intermittently available in the weeks thereafter,” the letter said. “Until then, we advise that no new patients begin treatment with Doxil.”  The injectable drug, which  has annual global sales of about $500 million, is used to treat ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma.  Doxil is among a growing number of drugs made by specialty drugmakers to develop shortages.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has expressed concern that in 2010 there were a record number of drug shortages, and that an increasing number have been seen this year — especially those involving older sterile injectable drugs.  The agency said the shortages have a range of causes, including manufacturing and quality issues, delays and discontinuations.  Other product shortages recently cited by the FDA include Telecris Biotherapeutics Inc’s form of human immune globulin and a number of products sold by Merck & Co — including treatments for black widow spider bites, to prevent shingles and to prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis B.

40,JNJ,PREVIEW-Report could sway U.S. FDA device review process," * Institute of Medicine report due out Friday   * FDA requested medical device unit review   * Changes to accelerated approval process a top issue   By Andrew Seaman   WASHINGTON, July 25 (Reuters) - The Institute of Medicine is poised to advise the U.S. drug regulator how it can refine its medical device approval process to get products to market quickly while protecting patients.   The Food and Drug Administration requested the IOM report as part of Commissioner Margaret Hamburg’s vow to improve the FDA’s device unit, an area dogged by high staff turnover and funding woes.   Friday’s report by the influential nonprofit organization is expected to address some of the more contentious changes proposed by FDA to the accelerated device approval process, known as the 510(k) program.   Critics say the accelerated 510(k) process is too widely used and leads to inadequate testing for some risky devices, but it is defended by industry as necessary to speed technologies to patients.   Nearly a year ago the FDA proposed changes to the program, including the possibility of creating a new category of more risky devices that would require more data to win approval.   This new category is among the issues the IOM report is expected to address.   “Potentially it could have a big impact on how things will be changed,” said Dr. Gregory Curfman, executive editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, of the IOM’s report.   Medical devices range from simple bandages to complex implants such as pacemakers, stents and artificial knees. The largest medical-device makers include Medtronic Inc (MDT.N), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N).   The 510(k) program allows medical devices to get to market faster if they are “substantially equivalent” to an existing product. Critics say this can allow unsafe products to reach the market. Most new medical devices — about 3,000 each year — are cleared through the program.   High-profile incidents include a massive recall last year of artificial hips by Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy unit. Some 93,000 patients worldwide had that line of hip implant. [ID:nN26186681]   Some health policy organizations were critical of the FDA for not moving sooner to make changes to the device approval process.   “Let me say that the whole process is illogical, because the FDA knows best what they need to do,” said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women & Families. “And in some kind of ideal world the FDA would have come out with these proposals and implemented them.”   Hamburg said on Monday that the agency should do more work to explain the approval process, especially to small device manufacturers.   “I think there’s a lot to be done,” she said in a speech at the office of Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy group. “I think the FDA has a responsibility to take a serious look at how we’re organized to do business.”  (Reporting by Andrew Seaman with additional reporting by Anna Yukhananov; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)  ",7252011,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-fda-devices/preview-report-could-sway-u-s-fda-device-review-process-idUSN1E76L0SS20110725

42,JNJ,Analysis: Advisers say time is right for high-yield stocks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prompted by a host of financial and economic developments, a growing number of investment advisers are steering their clients toward dividend-paying stocks.  “We are resolute in our belief that large, high-quality, dividend-paying companies, many of which are hiding in plain sight, offer a compelling investment option for growth and income,” Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, wrote in his latest memo to investors.  Luschini’s view, echoed by other advisers at other firms, is that the growth stock rally that started in March of 2009 is getting kind of old. More staid dividend-paying companies may hold up better as the economic recovery continues at a somewhat anemic pace.  “The stocks and assets that have done the best are likely to perform less than the large cap dividend-payers over the next few years,” Kate Warne, market strategist for St. Louis brokerage Edward Jones, told Reuters. “We think it’s time for individual investors to reposition into less risky stocks.”  There’s another reason why investors are drawn to dividends: There are no other really attractive places to get income. “Income-seekers are being starved,” Luschini said.  With one-year certificates of deposit paying less than 0.5 percent in interest and 10-year Treasury bonds yielding around 3 percent, it doesn’t seem like such a risk to take a flyer on a solid company paying a comparable amount.  “Here’s the way I look at it,” Luschini said. “If I can do better than 3 percent and own a company that, 10 years from now, will be worth as much if not more than it is today, that seems like a pretty enviable combination. It could be better than the bond you hold for 10 years.”  Finally, with the economy in slow-grow mode and interest rates very close to historic lows, there’s the belief that dividend-paying stocks could actually be safer than long-term bonds. While investors who hold bonds to maturity can expect to get their initial investment back, bonds do lose value when interest rates rise. Investors who have to sell bonds (or who invest in bond-holding mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) could lose money when rates rise.  Of course, stocks provide no guarantees either. “I’m hearing from investors who are going to dividend stocks for yield,” says Charles Rotblut of the American Association of Individual Investors. “But don’t forget that they can fluctuate in price.”  Here are some tips on how to use stocks for income without taking big risks.  * Don’t chase big yields. Right now, you can find publicly traded companies offering double-digit dividends, but there’s a reason for that - the company might have problems hanging over it that have depressed its price. Luschini tells clients the sweet spot for most safe dividend payers now is somewhere between 3 percent and 5 percent yields. He likes “household names” like Kimberly Clark, Exxon Mobil and Microsoft.  * Look for growing dividends. Buy companies that raise their dividend every year and “you’ll get a raise,” says Luschini. For example, Diebold has raised its dividend every year for 57 years, Johnson & Johnson has increased its payout for 47 years straight.  * Diversify sectors, or choose them carefully. Real estate investment trusts and utilities tend to pay higher than average dividends, but proceed with caution. “You might get a great yield but if there’s something upsetting that happens in that sector, you could lose significantly,” says Jeff Tjornehoj, a senior research analyst with Lipper, a Thomson Reuters company. Luschini’s firm is recommending companies with moderate 3 percent to 4 percent yields in the consumer staples, healthcare, energy and technology sectors. Warne likes the tech sector for its reasonable prices and solid dividends, too.  * Consider broad portfolios. Dividend-focused mutual funds, ETFs and premixed portfolios can provide solid income and spread risks among many companies and sectors. The WisdomTree Dividend ex-Financials Fund, highly rated by Lipper, is currently yielding more than 4 percent and returned a total of 8.89 percent to investors in the first half of this year, according to data from the company and Lipper. Morningstar recommends the Vanguard Dividend Growth Fund, yielding 1.93 percent and up 7.55 percent year-to-date through July 20, according to Morningstar numbers. Online pre-built portfolio company FolioInvesting.com offers two portfolios for dividend investors. Its High Dividend Folio, a mix of the actual shares of 30 stocks from a variety of sectors, is currently yielding 4.73 percent, the company reports.  * Use them wisely. Retired investors often pile up on dividend stocks so they can cash payout checks quarterly and monthly. It’s possible to choose companies with different payout dates and get dividend checks every month. But reinvesting dividends works, too. The S&P 500 has returned 3.34 percent a year to investors in the three years ending June 30, reports S&P. Without reinvested dividends? The increase would have been a much more trifling 1.05 percent annually.

43,JNJ,RPT-PREVIEW-Report could sway U.S. FDA device review process," (Repeats July 25 item to additional subscribers)   * Institute of Medicine report due out Friday   * FDA requested medical device unit review   * Changes to accelerated approval process a top issue   By Andrew Seaman   WASHINGTON, July 25 (Reuters) - The Institute of Medicine is poised to advise the U.S. drug regulator how it can refine its medical device approval process to get products to market quickly while protecting patients.   The Food and Drug Administration requested the IOM report as part of Commissioner Margaret Hamburg’s vow to improve the FDA’s device unit, an area dogged by high staff turnover and funding woes.   Friday’s report by the influential nonprofit organization is expected to address some of the more contentious changes proposed by FDA to the accelerated device approval process, known as the 510(k) program.   Critics say the accelerated 510(k) process is too widely used and leads to inadequate testing for some risky devices, but it is defended by industry as necessary to speed technologies to patients.   Nearly a year ago the FDA proposed changes to the program, including the possibility of creating a new category of more risky devices that would require more data to win approval.   This new category is among the issues the IOM report is expected to address.   “Potentially it could have a big impact on how things will be changed,” said Dr. Gregory Curfman, executive editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, of the IOM’s report.   Medical devices range from simple bandages to complex implants such as pacemakers, stents and artificial knees. The largest medical-device makers include Medtronic Inc (MDT.N), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N).   The 510(k) program allows medical devices to get to market faster if they are “substantially equivalent” to an existing product. Critics say this can allow unsafe products to reach the market. Most new medical devices — about 3,000 each year — are cleared through the program.   High-profile incidents include a massive recall last year of artificial hips by Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy unit. Some 93,000 patients worldwide had that line of hip implant. [ID:nN26186681]   Some health policy organizations were critical of the FDA for not moving sooner to make changes to the device approval process.   “Let me say that the whole process is illogical, because the FDA knows best what they need to do,” said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women & Families. “And in some kind of ideal world the FDA would have come out with these proposals and implemented them.”   Hamburg said on Monday that the agency should do more work to explain the approval process, especially to small device manufacturers.   “I think there’s a lot to be done,” she said in a speech at the office of Public Citizen, the consumer advocacy group. “I think the FDA has a responsibility to take a serious look at how we’re organized to do business.”  (Reporting by Andrew Seaman with additional reporting by Anna Yukhananov; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)  ",7262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-fda-devices/rpt-preview-report-could-sway-u-s-fda-device-review-process-idUSN1E76O1YG20110726

45,JNJ,Potential U.S. downgrade highlights strong balance sheets,"NEW YORK, July 27 (IFR) - A U.S. sovereign downgrade is likely to drive down yields on U.S. investment grade corporate bonds, as wary investors snap up these cash-rich credits and the government deals with its own messy balance sheet.  The looming downgrade has some investors rethinking the composition of their portfolios, and while there’s no pressing need yet to make major changes, the safer bets are beginning to emerge.  “I think a downgrade would have an impact more on the equity markets than on the debt markets,” said Bill Larkin, fixed-income portfolio manager at Cabot Money Management. “In the longer run after a downgrade, people are going to be more conservative, more risk averse. That could create a deflationary environment, which is a positive for bonds, not for equities.”  That’s not to say that a downgrade by any of the three major rating agencies would immediately take away the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds. In fact, those highly liquid securities could rally as a result.  However, a U.S. sovereign downgrade scenario has highlighted for many investors the comparably stellar earnings performance — and balance sheet strength — of U.S. corporations, making the corporate bond market (excluding financials) the go-to place for portfolio managers to get a safe pick-up over Treasuries.  “We’re not doing a whole lot differently <ahead of a potential downgrade>,” said Tom Murphy, portfolio manager at Columbia Management in Minneapolis. “We’re reducing our sensitivity to interest rates, but one thing that’s been lost in all this is how strong corporate earnings have been.  “Net income growth is about 20% for those in the S&P (excluding financials) that have reported. The best place to be right now is corporate bonds. Of course you have to pick your spots, and where we’re not generally investing is financials.”  Analysts, too, recognize the strength of corporations, excluding financials. A Moody’s report released earlier Wednesday noted that U.S. non-financial corporate cash holdings increased to $1.24trillion at the end of 2010 from $1.11trillion a year before, an 11.2% increase.  The report highlights how well diversified corporations’ revenue streams are — nearly half of the cash holdings reside overseas.  That has been a positive for bond investors and has given them a chance to own quality names like Microsoft (MSFT.O), Cisco Systems (CSCO.O), Pfizer (PFE.N) and Google (GOOG.O), which along with Apple (AAPL.O), held the largest amount of cash according to the report.  Despite huge cash piles, Microsoft, Cisco, and Google raised cash in the bond market this year to the tune of $9.25 billion combined, in part to repatriate some of that cash otherwise trapped abroad. Pfizer hasn’t been in the market since 2009, and Apple has never raised money in the bond market.  What’s more, despite an increase in shareholder-friendly activity, such as stock buybacks, increased dividends, and M&A — typically the bane of bondholders — investment-grade corporations are still rolling in cash. In short, corporate balance sheets are in order — and the government’s is not.  “Despite $483 billion of new bond issuance in 2010, the corporate debt-cash ratio (3.06x) is at its lowest since 2006 as companies use new proceeds to retire old debt,” according to Moody’s.  As a result, investors are expected to pay more attention to these cash-rich corporations in the event of a downgrade.  “I think all corporates should trade tighter,” Murphy said. “It will highlight the poor state of US finances against the quite strong corporate balance sheets.”  Still, a downgrade of the U.S. sovereign would create an anomaly for certain corporate investors. A handful of U.S. companies, those four remaining Triple A corporate borrowers, would have a credit rating higher than the U.S..  That creates a tricky situation. Investment grade corporations in the US use Treasury securities as a benchmark against which they price their own fixed-rate corporate bonds.  Should a downgrade occur, outstanding bonds issued by Microsoft, Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) — three of the four Triple A corporate issuers — could trade tighter than Treasuries. Automatic Data Processing ADP.N, the other AAA rated credit, had no senior unsecured debt outstanding.  The U.S. has nearly $10 trillion in Treasuries outstanding, whereas the Triple A industrial corporate name have in the 10s of billions of dollars of debt outstanding. It isn’t much in comparison.  But what might be viewed as a shift to a country where corporations trade tighter than the sovereign is already happening. The CDS on the U.S. sovereign was quoted on Tuesday at 59bp, after closing Monday at 57bp. Those levels are significantly wider than the 40.5bp quote on Microsoft, the 41bp level on J&J and Exxon’s 30.3bp level, also on Tuesday.  The effect on Triple A corporations will likely be limited.  “I don’t think in response to a U.S. downgrade that people are necessarily going to pile into Triple A companies,” said Murphy. “People don’t just buy things based on ratings alone - liquidity’s very important. People buy Treasuries for liquidity more so than for ratings.”  What’s more, investors might be turned off by the new, ultra-low spreads.  “We would likely sell those issues and reinvest in other higher-yielding corporate sectors,” said John Bender, head of U.S. fixed income at Legal & General Investment Management America.

47,JNJ,"Boston Scientific raises forecast, shares jump","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) raised its full-year profit forecast on Thursday as it posted quarterly results above Wall Street’s target and the company reported optimistic trends for new heart stents.  The company also said it would buy back $1 billion of its shares and it plans to cut 1,200 to 1,400 jobs, or roughly 5 percent of its workforce. Its shares were up 8.5 percent at midday.  Boston Scientific’s newly launched Ion stent provided a boost, while the company expects to launch its Promus Element stent in the United States before its previous target of June of next year.  “They took a lot of market share back,” JMP Securities analyst J.T. Haresco said of its key stent business.  Coupled with new products introductions in the next 18 to 24 months, he said, that “probably positions the company for a better leg of growth than I think what most people had anticipated.”  Analysts also hailed the stock buyback, which Gabelli & Co analyst Jeff Jonas noted amounted to 10 percent of the company’s market value.  “The big news is the billion dollar share buyback,” Jonas said. “That’s going to be a multiyear program, but that’s still a very nice boost.”  Boston Scientific shares had slumped 13 percent since the company announced in May that Chief Executive Officer Ray Elliott would leave at the end of 2011 after less than two years at the helm, stunning investors.  Elliott, on a conference call with analysts on Thursday, said there was nothing to read about the company’s performance into his departure and no “shoe to drop.”  “I’m leaving because I’m old,” he quipped.  The search for his replacement is “going well,” Elliott said.  Despite the positive report on Thursday, Jonas said the company faces growth concerns, namely in its two biggest markets for cardiovascular products: stents, and pacemakers and defibrillators. At around $7 a share, the stock is well below the $45 level it reached in 2004.  “Their markets are flat to negative,” Jonas said. “They’re holding share, they’ve gained a little bit of stent share, but there’s just not going to be any revenue growth.”  Quarterly net income rose to $146 million, or 10 cents per share, from $98 million, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier.  Excluding special items, Boston Scientific reported earnings of 17 cents per share. Including amortization expense, earnings of 12 cents per share were 4 cents ahead of analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Sales edged up 2 percent to $1.98 billion. Analysts were looking for $1.94 billion.  Sales at the cardiovascular group, which includes stents, rose 2 percent to $841 million. Stents are tiny mesh tubes that prop open arteries that have been cleared of plaque, and the most popular versions involve drug coatings that prevent the vessels from reclosing.  Analysts had expected gains in stent sales after Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said last month that it would withdraw from that business. J&J had up to 40 percent of the heart stent market.  However, company officials said on the conference call that they did not expect much benefit this year from J&J’s exit. Rather, the company pointed to its launch of the Ion, which launched in April, as driving performance in the business. Its market share of the U.S. drug-coated stent market rose from 46 percent to 51 percent.  The company also said it expected to start selling its Promus Element stent in the United States before its previous expectation of June of 2012.  “If they can continue that momentum and they can launch Promus Element earlier than expected, then that would be a positive for 2012,” Haresco said.  Boston Scientific reported a 3 percent increase in its cardiac rhythm management business (CRM), which includes implantable heart defibrillators and pacemakers, to $544 million. Wall Street analysts had expected a weak showing from the unit after rival St. Jude Medical STJ.N reported soft sales and said it saw the global market for the devices slowing further.  Goldman Sachs analyst David Roman called Boston Scientific’s quarterly results “high quality,” citing strong performance outside the CRM business.  The job cuts were part of a restructuring program that the company said would reduce annual operating expenses by about $225 million to $275 million. It estimated total pre-tax charges of about $155 million to $210 million related to the program.  Boston Scientific said it had prepaid the remaining $750 million of its term loan borrowings, reducing its gross debt to $4.2 billion. The company has been saddled with debt since its 2006 acquisition of Guidant Corp.  The company lifted its full-year profit forecast, excluding special items, to a range of 64 cents to 70 cents per share. It previously expected 58 cents to 68 cents.

49,JNJ,Buyout firms to bid for GSK drugs portfolio: sources,"(Reuters) - At least three private equity firms are planning to bid for a clutch of GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK.L) non-prescription products, expecting limited competition from rival large pharma groups, people familiar with the process said.  Advent International, Cinven CINV.UL and Warburg Pincus WP.UL are among firms considering bids for the over-the-counter (OTC) products, which include painkillers and vitamin supplements, people said.  GSK, Britain’s biggest drugmaker, said in February it planned to sell several non-core products with combined sales of around 500 million pounds ($817 million), representing about 10 percent of its total consumer healthcare business.  Advent is seen having an advantage over its rivals because it counts former GSK chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier among its group of operating partners — senior advisers who advise on potential deals and portfolio company development.  Non-binding bids are due on August 8, the people added.  GSK Chief Executive Andrew Witty said on Tuesday, when presenting Q2 results, that the auction of non-core brands was proceeding “on track” and the sale was expected to close in the fourth quarter.  He said there was interest from both private equity and strategic buyers, and GSK would take a pragmatic view about selecting those bidders offering best value for GSK’s shareholders.  Non-prescription medicines are a major focus for a number of GSK’s rivals, including Sanofi (SASY.PA), Novartis NOVN.VX and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), some of whom may want to pick up assets now on the block.  But rival firms are unlikely to want to buy all the brands on offer, and some have doubts about diet pill Alli that accounts for around one third of sales for the portfolio marked for disposal.  Industry analysts had initially estimated the products could fetch 3-4 times sales, implying a price tag of 1.5-2 billion pounds ($2.4-3.3 billion).  But some now believe the price could be less, given uncertainty about prospects for Alli, launched four years ago. It had a strong start but sales fell in 2010, when the product was tarnished by rare reports of liver injury.  Potential private equity buyers are also uncertain about the costs of carving the non-core products out of GSK, people said.  “It’s a tough portfolio and it’s not clear it has any coherence other than being stuff that GSK doesn’t want,” said one of the people.  Consumer healthcare is a favored investment sector for private equity players, who like the defensive nature of a business that has stable cash flows.  Despite the divestment, consumer healthcare will stay a priority area for GSK, which aims to focus its efforts on successful top-selling brands like Sensodyne toothpaste and nutritional drink Horlicks.  Faced with slowing sales growth and a squeeze on margins, many pharmaceutical companies are looking to divest non-core businesses to improve their financial performance.  GSK’s British rival AstraZeneca (AZN.L) recently sold its Astra Tech dental unit for $1.8 billion to Dentsply International (XRAY.O), while Pfizer (PFE.N) is embarking on the sector’s most far-reaching divestment program with plans to sell or spin off its animal health and nutrition units.

51,JNJ,Boston Scientific raises forecast as profit rises,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as sales of its heart stents benefited from a rival’s exit, and the company raised its full-year profit forecast.  The company also said it had paid down some of its hefty debt and planned to buy back $1 billion of its stock. Its shares rose more than 5 percent in premarket trading.  “It’s pretty much what people were expecting,” Edward Jones analyst Aaron Vaughn said of the results. “The financial situation there is improving.”  Second-quarter net income rose to $146 million, or 10 cents per share, from $98 million, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, Boston Scientific reported earnings of 17 cents per share. Including amortization expense, earnings of 12 cents per share were 4 cents ahead of the analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Sales edged up 2 percent to $1.98 billion. Analysts were looking for $1.94 billion.  Sales at the cardiovascular group, which includes stents, rose 2 percent to $841 million.  Analysts had expected some potential gains for the stent sales after Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said last month that it would withdraw from that business. J&J had about one-third to 40 percent of the heart stent market.  Boston Scientific reported a 3 percent increase in its cardiac rhythm management business, which includes implantable heart defibrillators and pacemaker, to $544 million. Wall Street analysts had expected a weak showing from the unit after rival St. Jude Medical STJ.N reported soft sales and said it saw the global market for the devices slowing further.  Boston Scientific said it had prepaid the remaining $750 million of its term loan borrowings, which reduces its gross debt to $4.2 billion.  The company lifted its full-year profit forecast, excluding items, to a range of 64 cents to 70 cents per share. It had previously expected 58 cents to 68 cents.  Shares of Boston Scientific were up 5.1 percent at $7.05 in trading before the market opened.

53,JNJ,New drug regulator asks Congress for more power,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Drug companies should take more responsibility for the safety of ingredients sourced overseas, and Congress should make them if they do not, according to the new U.S. drug regulator for import safety.  The Food and Drug Administration should also have the power to stop medicines at the border if their manufacturers refused FDA inspections, and the power to order mandatory recalls of unsafe products, said Deborah Autor, the agency’s newly appointed deputy commissioner.  “People are shocked when they learn that we do not have mandatory recalls (of drugs),” Autor told Reuters in her first interview since she was named head of global compliance earlier this month.  Autor has been making these arguments for at least three years, ever since a contaminant-laced blood thinner, heparin, made its way to the United States from China, killing 81 people and sparking lengthy congressional hearings about the FDA’s authority.  At the time, Autor was director of the FDA’s compliance office, making her directly responsible for unsafe or ineffective drugs.  Since the heparin scandal, she has also overseen the response to a series of massive over-the-counter medicine recalls from healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson and garnered a public service award nomination for cracking down on counterfeit or unapproved prescription medication.  In the newly created role of deputy commissioner for global regulatory operations and policy, Autor will be responsible for similar issues of consumer safety, but with a much larger scope, working to ensure drugs, food and clinical trials from abroad adhere to standards comparable to those in the United States.  Her new office, now a major FDA center alongside medical products and food, is part of the agency’s big push in recent years to transform itself into a globally focused regulator that can address the growing amount of imported food and drug ingredients that are consumed in the United States.  In a June report outlining its new global strategy, the FDA said about half of all medical devices and 40 percent of pharmaceuticals are made abroad, with some 80 percent of the active ingredients in U.S. drugs also manufactured overseas.  Between 2007 and 2015, it is estimated that imports of FDA-regulated products will triple, while the agency’s inspections budget is unlikely to keep up.  Even at current rates, it would take an estimated nine years for FDA to inspect every high-priority pharmaceutical facility just once, it said.  While the FDA asked Washington for new authority in 2008, the overhaul of U.S. food safety which passed Congress in 2010 did not include provisions about drug safety.  The Food Safety Modernization Act gave the FDA power to order mandatory recalls of food, but drug statutes remained largely the same as they were in 1938.  This time around, Congressional action may be more likely. At a Senate hearing on Thursday, Tom Harkin, the chairman of the influential Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said one of his policy priorities was “helping to ensure the integrity of our global pharmaceutical supply chain.” He will hold hearings on the issue in the fall.  The Committee is likely to give the FDA stronger authority over drugs as part of a broader bill to renew FDA industry fees, which expire next year.  “We’ve talked about this quite a bit publicly,” Autor said. “So I’m glad to see Congress picking it up.”  Autor started her public health career as a trial attorney at the Department of Justice, litigating civil and criminal cases on behalf of the FDA, before joining the agency’s office of compliance in 2002.  Her top priority when she begins her new job as early as next week is to build more partnerships with global regulatory authorities, especially in Europe, Australia and Canada.  Recognizing that it is impossible for a single country to inspect the world’s drug supply, Autor said she will work with counterparts to share information on inspections and make sure medical product facilities and clinical trials run according to “science-based standards.”  Like the 60-year-old model for international air traffic control, the FDA wants to create a system of mutually recognized safety regulations.  “This model necessitates mutual reliance, even with countries that have different standards,” Autor said. “To me, it matters whether we are comfortable with the outcomes of their systems.  “If I were in Europe, I’d feel comfortable taking European drugs,” she said.  Maybe less so drugs from China or India, the major countries for drug manufacturing. Together, in 2007 they housed nearly 70 percent of the world’s manufacturing sites for active drug ingredients, up from 49 percent in 2004, according to a report by Pew Health Group, “After Heparin.”  Besides heparin, Chinese manufacturers have been linked to a series of consumer product recalls ranging from contaminated pet food to excessive lead in paint that saw millions of toys swept from stores.  “The level of advancement of a local regulatory authority can affect the level of risk associated with a locality’s products,” Autor said. “But I think bad things can happen anywhere in the world, including here in the U.S.  “We need to look at every link in the supply chain and consider every risk.”  ",7292011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fda-autor/new-drug-regulator-asks-congress-for-more-power-idUSTRE76S3T620110729
54,JNJ,FDA balks at medical device shakeup,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An advisory group said the U.S. fast-track approval process for medical devices is fatally flawed and should be replaced, but the Food and Drug Administration said the recommendation was a non-starter.  The FDA had asked for the Institute of Medicine report as part of a broad agency review of its device unit, an area dogged by high staff turnover, funding woes and major recalls in recent years of devices ranging from artificial hips to heart defibrillators.  The IOM found the fast-track approval process, called 510(k), does not adequately protect patients and recommended a more thorough process that would likely to raise the costs for device makers with pre-market and post-market device reviews.  “What we are recommending is that the 510(k) is fatally flawed in terms of it not evaluating safety and effectiveness of a device,” said Dr. David Challoner, chairman of the IOM’s committee.  But the finding was swiftly rejected by the FDA’s top device official.  “FDA believes that the 510(k) process should not be eliminated, but we are open to additional proposals and approaches for continued improvement of our device review programs,” Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.  Wall Street analysts said the report was not a game-changer, at least in the near term. Legislation would be required for any significant changes to the device approval process.  “The 510(k) process was established in 1976 and it was meant to be a temporary stop-gap,” said Thomas Gunderson, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. “The process can certainly be improved upon, but at the current pace, I don’t see this (IOM report) having any meaningful impact.”  Senator Al Franken said the IOM was advocating new burdens for the medical device industry without a clear path to a more effective process.  “Calling for the elimination of the 510(k) process could be very harmful to innovation,” said Franken, a member of the Senate’s health committee and whose state of Minnesota is home to Medtronic Inc, a major device maker.  The 510(k) program allows medical devices to get to market faster if they are “substantially equivalent” to an existing product.  Critics say the accelerated 510(k) process is too widely used and leads to inadequate testing for some risky devices, but it is defended by the industry as necessary to speed technologies to patients.  The medical device industry has argued for either leaving the 510(k) process as it is or further streamlining the approval process. Most new medical devices — about 4,000 in 2009 — are cleared through the accelerated program.  IOM’s Challoner said in a briefing on Friday that he recognizes the report is suggesting “a paradigm shift” that could be disquieting to the medical device industry, consumers and regulators.  Another IOM committee member, however, said the current 510(k) system “has been reasonably safe.”  “We do not believe that one has to shut down the system tonight. We think it is working adequately in the short term,” said William Vodra.  The industry group Advanced Medical Technology Association, or AdvaMed, said Congress and the FDA should not seriously consider the report’s conclusions.  “(The report) proposes abandoning efforts to address the serious problems with the administration of the current program by replacing it at some unknown date with an untried, unproven and unspecified new legal structure,” AdvaMed’s CEO and president Stephen Ubl said. “This would be a disservice to patients and the public health.”  Medical devices range from simple bandages to complex implants such as pacemakers, stents and artificial knees. Other than Johnson & Johnson, the largest medical-device makers include Medtronic, Boston Scientific Corp and Abbott Laboratories Inc.  High-profile incidents include a massive recall last year of artificial hips by Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy unit.  Some 93,000 patients worldwide had that line of hip implant.  Automated external defibrillators, used in public places such as airports to revive cardiac arrest victims, have also made up a significant portion of 510(k) recalls in recent years. Health officials are looking at thousands of reports of malfunctions which may have led to patient harm or death.

Together, in 2007 they housed nearly 70 percent of the world’s manufacturing sites for active drug ingredients, up from 49 percent in 2004, according to a report by Pew Health Group, “After Heparin.”  Besides heparin, Chinese manufacturers have been linked to a series of consumer product recalls ranging from contaminated pet food to excessive lead in paint that saw millions of toys swept from stores.  “The level of advancement of a local regulatory authority can affect the level of risk associated with a locality’s products,” Autor said. “But I think bad things can happen anywhere in the world, including here in the U.S.  “We need to look at every link in the supply chain and consider every risk.”  ",8012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fda-autor/new-drug-regulator-asks-congress-for-more-power-idUSTRE76S3T620110801
58,JNJ,"Pfizer global drug sales fall, spark concern","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) showed further weakness in its main business of prescription medicines, sending shares down more than 3 percent on concern over future growth as the company prepares to divest better-performing non-pharmaceuticals businesses.  The world's largest drugmaker saw sales declines in primary care, specialty care, branded generic and oncology medicines during the second quarter. One of the few bright spots was that drug sales grew in emerging markets. (For a graphic on Pfizer's earnings, see: r.reuters.com/vuf92s )  That could mean it is more vulnerable ahead of the U.S. patent expiration in November on its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol fighter. Generic competition has already begun to chip away at overseas sales of the $10 billion-a-year drug.  Pfizer said global prescription drug sales fell 3 percent in the quarter to $14.64 billion, and were down 7 percent after stripping out the benefit of the weaker dollar. Lipitor worldwide sales fell 8 percent to $2.59 billion.  Those declines were partly offset by a stronger performance in its animal health and nutritional products business. But Pfizer plans to divest those units in the next year or two, through a sale or spin-off. The combined value of the businesses could exceed $16 billion.  “We believe these businesses are worth more outside of Pfizer than in Pfizer,” Chief Executive Ian Read said in an interview. He added the company was focusing instead on promising medicines now in development.  Pfizer earned $2.61 billion, or 33 cents per share in the quarter. That compared with $2.48 billion or 31 cents per share a year ago.  Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 60 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 59 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Results were helped by a lower effective tax rate of 29 percent, from 32 percent a year ago, due to extension of a federal research and development credit.  Total revenue fell 1 percent to $16.98 billion, matching Wall Street expectations, but would have fallen 5 percent if not for the weaker dollar, which boosts overseas sales.  Pfizer shares fell 3.5 percent at $18.36 in afternoon trade, leading a 1.7 percent decline for the drug sector.  Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said the stock was hurt by disappointment Pfizer did not report better-than-expected sales, as rivals like Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) did in the quarter, and by a surprisingly high level of expenses.  Wall Street has been sour on Pfizer for much of the past five years due to its steadily falling earnings, plunging share price and its inability to create big-selling new medicines. But some investors had begun to look for new growth opportunities in an improving experimental drug pipeline and cost savings derived from its 2009 purchase of rival Wyeth.  Over the past year, Pfizer shares have risen 20 percent, twice the advance seen for the drug sector.  “If you look at the pipeline there’s a lot of exciting things going on,” said CLSA analyst David Maris, referring to Pfizer’s experimental drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, lung cancer and blood clots that are now in late-stage trials.  Upcoming data on Pfizer’s rheumatoid arthritis drug tofacitinib is critical for the company, said Edward Jones analyst Linda Bannister.  The pill works by blocking a protein called Jak-3 and could be deemed more convenient than Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) Remicade and other treatments that are injected or infused.  “The big thing this year is the Jak-3,” Bannister said. “People are paying close attention to that.”  For the first time, Pfizer’s animal health products crossed the $1 billion mark, with sales jumping 18 percent to $1.06 billion — bolstered by the company’s recent acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals and its Alpharma brands.  Sales of consumer healthcare products, including its Robitussen cough medicines acquired through its purchase of Wyeth, rose 6 percent to $721 million. Revenue from nutritional products rose 4 percent to $493 million.  Pfizer earlier this year said it would cut as much as 25 percent of its $8 billion to $8.5 billion research budget to deliver on a 2012 profit forecast.  The drugmaker on Tuesday reaffirmed its 2011 profit forecast of $2.16 to $2.26 per share, excluding special items. It predicted earnings in 2012 of $2.25 to $2.35 per share — reflecting stable or improved earnings the first full year Lipitor faces U.S. generics.

60,JNJ,UPDATE 4-Dendreon plunges as Provenge prospects wither," * Shocks investors by pulling forecast for debut drug   * Company points to reimbursement qualms for doctors   * News likely to dissuade potential buyers, partners   * Shares dive 67.4 percent  (Adds analyst comment, options trading; updates shares)   By Bill Berkrot   NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Dendreon Corp DNDN.O lost two thirds of its market value on Thursday after abandoning its forecast for its debut drug, prostate cancer vaccine Provenge, shocking its biggest backers on Wall Street.   Dendreon said late on Wednesday it could not deliver on promised sales of the high-priced drug because doctors weren’t confident enough about getting reimbursed. [ID:nN1E7721QB]   Analysts, caught off guard by a company retreat from a 2011 forecast steadfastly maintained since November, were left questioning the company’s business model.   Some said the disclosure would dissuade bigger drugmakers from considering a bid for Dendreon and could ward off marketing partners.   “I took my Dendreon model to the woodshed by cutting my peak Provenge sales estimates by more than 50 percent,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note.   In addition to pulling its forecast, Dendreon reported disappointing second-quarter sales, and said it would trim expenses and jobs. By Thursday morning, it was the subject of a wave of brokerage downgrades on the stock.   “We were taken aback by this explanation as our own checks, recent milestones and management’s tone just a few weeks ago have all been positive,” said Baird Equity Research analyst Christopher Raymond, who cut his rating on the stock to “neutral” from “outperform,” and slashed his price target to $20 from $56.   Dendreon shares closed down 67.4 percent at $11.69 on Nasdaq, slashing the value of stakes for investors like S.A.C. Capital Advisors, Vanguard Group, BlackRock Financial Management and Soros Fund Management, who were among its top 10 shareholders as of March 31.   The decline also hit other biotech stocks, with the NYSARC Biotech index .BTK  off more than 10 percent.   Provenge is a new type of cancer drug, tailored to each patient, that works by stimulating the person’s immune system to fight tumors. It costs $93,000 for a course of treatment.   Once considered an acquisition target, Dendreon could have more trouble selling itself despite what would now be a far lower price.   “Buyers prefer to pay a premium for a sure thing or a success that has already occurred than to go bottom fishing on a failed launch,” said Lazard Capital Markets analyst Joel Sendek.   Michael Becker, president of the MD Becker Partners consulting firm, said Dendreon shares may even be priced too richly, given the problems with the company.   “The very fact that Dendreon was unsuccessful in securing a corporate partner either prior to FDA approval or shortly thereafter really underscores the fundamental flaw in their business model,” Becker said, citing the patient-specific nature of the drug, its high price, competition from easier-to-use medicines and Provenge’s minimal efficacy.   Since the approval of Provenge a year ago, Dendreon management has blamed limited manufacturing capacity for a slow sales ramp. With far more production stations approved and on line, the company had said 2011 sales would reach $350 million to $400 million, including a blowout fourth quarter that would account for half of that total.   That forecast is now gone, along with some $3 billion of the biotechnology company’s market value, and the company is pointing to reimbursement concerns.   Dendreon said only about 25 percent of potential Provenge prescribers were aware of a June 30 decision by Medicare to cover the drug’s cost. Doctors can now use a so-called Q code on the drug that can help speed up reimbursement.   Dendreon said educating doctors on Provenge reimbursement will be a priority for its sales force.   Dendreon also indicated a problem for some doctors in identifying the right patients for the drug and understanding its delivery. This was particularly the case among urologists who are less familiar with infused drugs than oncologists.   Provenge had initial success with large academic medical centers less concerned about the timeliness of reimbursement payments. The company said adoption among small community practices of urologists and oncologists has been much slower because they want to be assured that they will get paid before ordering Provenge.   While the company said more than 300 infusion sites were prepared to treat patients with Provenge by the end of July, it said they were averaging less than one patient per center.   A major pharmaceutical or biotech partner with a large sales force well versed in cancer drugs could go a long way to addressing Dendreon’s problems. With limited cash and disappointing sales, Dendreon may need one to get its drug off the ground outside the United States.   “They previously stated they would use cash flow from U.S. business to fund the European launch, and it seems to me that unless the U.S. launch really picks up, the only practical way to move forward expeditiously in Europe is with a partner,” Lazard’s Sendek said.   Dendreon also faces competition from new advanced prostate cancer drug Zytiga backed by Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) marketing muscle, as well as other easier-to-use medicines on the horizon.   Dendreon’s woes have made some investors wealthier. About 11 percent of the company’s outstanding shares were shorted by those betting against Provenge, according to Starmine data.   Options players were still seeking a way in on Thursday, with call buying at the August strike prices of $15 and $13, said Jon Najarian, founder of optionMonster.com.   “It’s safe to say that amateurs are betting on a near-term bounce, but professionals are betting that it would take a long time for the bounce,” he said.

Dendreon said educating doctors on Provenge reimbursement will be a priority for the sales force.  “The fact that the company has elected to cut heads seems to be a decision inconsistent with a management team that truly believed they could clear reimbursement hurdles next year and begin to ramp sales substantially,” Schoenebaum said.  The sell-off of Dendreon shares dragged down other biotech stocks, analysts said, with the NYSARC Biotech index .BTK off 9 percent. Shares of Human Genome Sciences IncHGSI.O, another small biotech with one relatively new product, were down 10 percent.  “Biotech risk takers burned on this one might be less risk tolerant going forward.

The EU commission cleared the 150mg dose for most patients, while the 110mg dose will be available for patients aged 80 years or above and certain risks groups, the unlisted German drugmaker said on Thursday.

66,JNJ,CORRECTED - US approval of Roche melanoma drug may come early,"  (Corrects FDA review deadline in paragraph 4 to Oct. 28 from Nov. 11)  * FDA approval could come as early as this week-source   * Simultaneous approval of diagnostic test expected   * Roche drug would compete with Bristol’s Yervoy   By Deena Beasley   LOS ANGELES, Aug 9 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are moving quickly with Roche’s ROG.VX application for targeted melanoma drug vemurafenib, which could receive approval as early as this week, according to a source familiar with the situation.   A pivotal trial found that advanced melanoma patients taking the experimental pill, being developed in partnership with Daiichi Sankyo (4568.T), were 63 percent less likely to die from the disease than patients given chemotherapy.   Vemurafenib, whose brand name is Zelboraf, is designed for patients with tumors that have a mutation in a gene known as BRAF that allows melanoma cells to grow. About half of all melanomas, the deadliest form of skin cancer, have the genetic aberration.   Roche filed for U.S. approval of the drug in May and the Food and Drug Administration is slated to decide on the application no later than Oct. 28. Approval of a test to detect the BRAF mutation is expected at the same time.   “We are getting the sense that approval is imminent,” said the source familiar with the matter.   An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on the timing of a decision, but did say the November deadline is “a performance goal post” for the agency, which in the past has approved medicines ahead of time.   In late April, the FDA approved Johnson and Johnson’s (JNJ.N) prostate cancer drug Zytiga about two months before the scheduled deadline.   In March, the FDA approved the first treatment to help patients with advanced melanoma live longer. The drug Yervoy, or ipilimumab, is sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N).   Yervoy, which posted better-than-expected sales in the second quarter and costs about $120,000 for a course of therapy, is an antibody designed to spur the immune system to fight off the melanoma.   Analysts have forecast annual Zelboraf sales for Roche of $732 million by 2015, while Bristol’s Yervoy sales are expected to reach $1.43 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Roche and Bristol have also agreed to collaborate on a novel clinical trial to see if the two melanoma drugs are safe and effective if taken together, potentially allowing them to be prescribed as a drug cocktail. [ID:nN06254719]   Roche’s Genentech unit, which will market the cancer drug in the United States, declined to comment on price. The company estimates that around 9,500 of the 70,000 new cases of melanoma expected to be diagnosed in the United States this year will be advanced forms of the skin cancer, with the BRAF mutation found in about half of all melanoma cases.  The diagnostic test will cost around $150, according to Paul Brown, president of Roche Diagnostics.  “This is really now the exemplar of personalized healthcare ... science and our understanding of disease has fundamentally changed and grown over the last 5 to 10 years,” he said.   If approved, the medicine would be the first new oncology product from Genentech since 2004’s launch of lung cancer drug Tarceva.   Dr. Jeffrey Sosman, director of the melanoma program at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee and a vemurafenib trial investigator, said the drug “will have an immediate impact on many patients with melanoma,” particularly those with aggressive disease.   “Ipilimumab has very different characteristics, and in patients with disease that is not so aggressive and you have a much longer period in which to follow them, ipi is a good alternative and could be given initially,” he said.   Sosman also said patients eventually become resistant to Zelboraf, and there is a need for more investigation of combination therapies.   “I’m alive,” said 52-year-old melanoma patient Susan Steel. “I probably wouldn’t be without this drug.”   Diagnosed with melanoma in 2005, Steel has been on vemurafenib since January under an expanded access program and seen her tumor volume shrink as much as 80 percent.   Side effects have included rash, slight hair loss, extreme photosensitivity and joint pain.   “All of this is irrelevant,” Steel said. “I can still talk. I can still make speeches, take care of my children ... I can listen to all the reasons why my daughter doesn’t want to complete her college applications. That was a gift.”   (Reporting by Deena Beasley; Editing by Michele Gershberg)  ",8092011,http://www.reuters.com/article/roche-melanoma/corrected-us-approval-of-roche-melanoma-drug-may-come-early-idUSN1E77323B20110809
67,JNJ,FDA approves Gilead's once-daily HIV pill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Regulators approved a once-daily HIV pill by Gilead Sciences Inc, giving a new source of revenue to the leading maker of HIV medicines as it faces expiring patents.  The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday gave a nod to the pill Complera for patients who have not received prior treatment for the virus that causes AIDS. The $1,705-a-month drug combines Gilead’s Truvada with Johnson & Johnson’s Edurant, which received FDA approval in May.

69,JNJ,Bayer anti-clot drug gets cautious journal welcome,"LONDON (Reuters) - An anti-clotting pill from Bayer and Johnson & Johnson offers a new way of preventing stroke although further studies will be needed to refine treatment options, according to a review in a top medical journal.  Wednesday’s editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) will be read closely by doctors and industry analysts, who have been grappling with results from a difficult-to-interpret clinical trial of Xarelto.  Gregory Zoppo of the University of Washington, and Misha Eliasziw of the University of Calgary, said the mix of statistical analyses used to assess the once-daily drug had “muddied the waters” over its benefits.  Xarelto, known generically as rivaroxaban, was hailed last November as being 21 percent better at preventing stroke in patients with a form of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation (AF) than the standard treatment, warfarin.  But this conclusion was based on an analysis that excluded certain patients. When all those who entered the trial were evaluated, no superiority was established for Xarelto.  “I think we can say safely that rivaroxaban is not inferior to warfarin. I don’t think we can say it is superior,” Zoppo said in a telephone interview. “Non-inferiority is not a bad thing.”  The editorial also highlighted the fact warfarin, which requires patients to have regular blood tests to ensure correct dosing, was not used as effectively as it might have been in the study.  And the authors said an “important concern” was that new anticoagulants such as Xarelto did not have antidotes to rapidly reverse their anti-coagulation effects in the event of serious bleeding. Patients on warfarin can be given vitamin K.  The full results of the so-called ROCKET-AF study were published in the NEJM alongside the editorial.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Xarelto for preventing blood clots after knee and hip surgery, and it is expected to decide whether to approve it in the much larger stroke-prevention market later this year.  A similar drug called Pradaxa, or dabigatran, from Boehringer Ingelheim is on the market and several others are under development, including apixaban from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer.  All aim to replace warfarin, a problematic drug, in the lucrative market for millions of mainly elderly patients with AF. Zoppo said their arrival was a notable advance.  “What’s really exciting about rivaroxaban and dabigatran is now we have some alternatives to warfarin that are relatively easy to take and their control seems to be pretty straightforward,” he said.  “Is everybody going to switch from warfarin? I think the answer is ‘No’. Patients who are managed very well on warfarin should stay on it.”  He said there was scope for further trials looking at the relative merits of existing drugs and other, even newer ones still in earlier stages of development.

71,JNJ,FDA approval of Roche melanoma drug may come early,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are moving quickly with Roche’s application for targeted melanoma drug vemurafenib, which could receive approval as early as this week, according to a source familiar with the situation.  A pivotal trial found that advanced melanoma patients taking the experimental pill, being developed in partnership with Daiichi Sankyo, were 63 percent less likely to die from the disease than patients given chemotherapy.  Vemurafenib, whose brand name is Zelboraf, is designed for patients with tumors that have a mutation in a gene known as BRAF that allows melanoma cells to grow. About half of all melanomas, the deadliest form of skin cancer, have the genetic aberration.  Roche filed for U.S. approval of the drug in April and the Food and Drug Administration is slated to decide on the application no later than October 28. Approval of a test to detect the BRAF mutation is expected at the same time.  “We are getting the sense that approval is imminent,” said the source familiar with the matter.  An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on the timing of a decision, but did say the deadline is “a performance goal post” for the agency, which in the past has approved medicines ahead of time.  In late April, the FDA approved Johnson and Johnson’s prostate cancer drug Zytiga about two months before the scheduled deadline.  In March, the FDA approved the first treatment to help patients with advanced melanoma live longer. The drug Yervoy, or ipilimumab, is sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb.  Yervoy, which posted better-than-expected sales in the second quarter and costs about $120,000 for a course of therapy, is an antibody designed to spur the immune system to fight off the melanoma.  Analysts have forecast annual Zelboraf sales for Roche of $732 million by 2015, while Bristol’s Yervoy sales are expected to reach $1.43 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Roche and Bristol have also agreed to collaborate on a novel clinical trial to see if the two melanoma drugs are safe and effective if taken together, potentially allowing them to be prescribed as a drug cocktail.  Roche’s Genentech unit, which will market the cancer drug in the United States, declined to comment on price. The company estimates that around 9,500 of the 70,000 new cases of melanoma expected to be diagnosed in the United States this year will be advanced forms of the skin cancer, with the BRAF mutation found in about half of all melanoma cases.  The diagnostic test will cost around $150, according to Paul Brown, president of Roche Diagnostics.  “This is really now the exemplar of personalized healthcare ... science and our understanding of disease has fundamentally changed and grown over the last 5 to 10 years,” he said.  If approved, the medicine would be the first new oncology product from Genentech since 2004’s launch of lung cancer drug Tarceva.  Dr. Jeffrey Sosman, director of the melanoma program at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee and a vemurafenib trial investigator, said the drug “will have an immediate impact on many patients with melanoma,” particularly those with aggressive disease.  “Ipilimumab has very different characteristics, and in patients with disease that is not so aggressive and you have a much longer period in which to follow them, ipi is a good alternative and could be given initially,” he said.  Sosman also said patients eventually become resistant to Zelboraf, and there is a need for more investigation of combination therapies.  “I’m alive,” said 52-year-old melanoma patient Susan Steel. “I probably wouldn’t be without this drug.”  Diagnosed with melanoma in 2005, Steel has been on vemurafenib since January under an expanded access program and seen her tumor volume shrink as much as 80 percent.  Side effects have included rash, slight hair loss, extreme photosensitivity and joint pain.  “All of this is irrelevant,” Steel said. “I can still talk. I can still make speeches, take care of my children ... I can listen to all the reasons why my daughter doesn’t want to complete her college applications. That was a gift.”  (This story corrects the filing timeline in paragraph 4 from May to April)  ",8102011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-roche-melanoma/fda-approval-of-roche-melanoma-drug-may-come-early-idUSTRE7795EF20110810

73,JNJ,J&J; reaches some agreement on U.S. Risperdal probe," NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said it reached an agreement related to a misdemeanor charge stemming from a federal investigation into the marketing of its Risperdal schizophrenia treatment, although some issues remain unresolved.   In its quarterly securities filing, J&J said that discussions have been ongoing to resolve criminal penalties related to the promotion of Risperdal, a onetime big-selling product for the company.   “An agreement in principal on key issues relevant to a disposition of criminal charges pursuant to a single misdemeanor violation of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act has been reached, but certain issues remain open before a settlement can be finalized,” J&J said in the filing.   J&J said it had adjusted the amount accrued in the second quarter to cover the financial component of the proposed criminal settlement.   The U.S. government also plans to intervene in whistle-blower suits alleging “off-label” promotion of Risperdal and file a superseding complaint, J&J said in the filing. Off-label promotion refers to marketing of a drug outside of its approved uses.  (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, editing by Gerald E.

75,JNJ,"Obama, CEOs talk markets, global economy woes","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global financial upheaval was on the agenda on Friday when President Barack Obama met with top executives from the U.S. business community, the White House said.  Chief executives from Johnson & Johnson, Wells Fargo & Co, U.S. Bank, Xerox Corp, BlackRock Inc, Silver Lake Partners, American Express and U.S. Steel all met with Obama to discuss the economy and the president’s plans to create jobs.  Obama held his latest in a series of talks with Big Business against the backdrop of a euro zone debt crisis that has hit financial markets worldwide, adding to investor anxiety in the aftermath of last week’s U.S. credit downgrade.  Before Friday’s session which included major players from the financial sector, the White House said market turmoil and economic troubles around the world would be among the issues discussed, along with the U.S. economy and job creation.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest denied the meeting was called in reaction to market and global concerns but said: “They’ll certainly talk about these issues, about the market reaction here.”  The meeting came at the end of a volatile week. U.S. stocks rose on Friday as mildly upbeat retail sales data offset a closely watched barometer showing U.S. consumer sentiment at its lowest point in more than three decades.  European stock markets also gained despite continued concern about French banks’ exposure to European debt woes.  Critics have complained that Obama has failed to reassure Americans as markets whipsawed this week, in one of the most dramatic periods in the stock market since he took office amid the financial crisis in January 2009.  He said on Thursday that Europe’s debt troubles were among the global challenges weighing on the struggling U.S. recovery, but the White House said the administration remained confident in European leaders’ ability to handle the situation.  Obama’s hopes for re-election in 2012 will likely hinge on his success in lowering unemployment, currently pinned above 9 percent, boosting sluggish growth and restoring confidence lost from the Standard & Poor’s downgrade and fractious debt talks.  White House meetings with executives have become almost routine as Obama has courted business leaders while seeking to cast himself as more of a centrist.

79,JNJ,"J&J;, Lilly drugs found among best for manic episodes","LONDON (Reuters) - Antipsychotics are far more effective than mood stabilizers in tackling acute manic episodes, researchers found, and Eli Lilly’s Zyprexa, Johnson & Johnson’s Risperdal and generic haloperidol outperform the rest.  In a study published in the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday, researchers from Britain and Italy ranked antipsychotic drugs according to their effectiveness and said that since current treatment guidelines don’t differentiate between the drugs, their findings could offer useful guidance for doctors.  “Strikingly, some antipsychotic drugs were overall significantly more effective than mood stabilizers,” the researchers, led by Andrea Cipriani of Verona University and John Geddes of Oxford University, wrote in their study.  “These results have potential clinical implications that should be considered in the development of clinical practice guidelines.”  Mania, defined as an “excessively raised mood,” affects around 1 percent of the population worldwide, and experts say it tends to alternate with periods of depression. These swings define the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.  Cipriani’s team analyzed the results from 68 randomized controlled trials involving more than 16,000 participants from January 1980 to November 2010 to compare the most common drugs used to treat acute mania in adults.

80,JNJ,"J&J;, Lilly drugs found among best for manic episodes"," * Study finds generic haloperidol ranks top for acute treatment   * Researchers say findings should inform clinical guidelines    By Kate Kelland	   LONDON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Antipsychotics are far more effective than mood stabilisers in tackling acute manic episodes, researchers found, and Eli Lilly’s Zyprexa, Johnson & Johnson’s Risperdal and generic haloperidol outperform the rest. 	   In a study published in the Lancet medical journal on Wednesday, researchers from Britain and Italy ranked antipsychotic drugs according to their effectiveness and said that since current treatment guidelines don’t differentiate between the drugs, their findings could offer useful guidance for doctors.	   “Strikingly, some antipsychotic drugs were overall significantly more effective than mood stabilisers,” the researchers, led by Andrea Cipriani of Verona University and John Geddes of Oxford University, wrote in their study.	   “These results have potential clinical implications that should be considered in the development of clinical practice guidelines.”	   Mania, defined as an “excessively raised mood”, affects around 1 percent of the population worldwide, and experts say it tends to alternate with periods of depression. These swings define the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.	   Cipriani’s team analysed the results from 68 randomised controlled trials involving more than 16,000 participants from January 1980 to November 2010 to compare the most common drugs used to treat acute mania in adults. 	   They found that haloperidol, Zyprexa and Risperdal were the most effective antimanic drugs and said they “should be considered as among the best of the available options for the treatment of manic episodes”.	   Zyprexa has been one of Elli Lilly’s top-selling drugs, but is set to lose its valuable marketing exclusivity in the United States in October. 	   Haloperidol also had the highest number of significant differences in head-to-head comparisons, coming out better than Otsuka Pharmaceutical’s Abilify, known generically as aripiprazole;` carbamazepine, sold as Carbatrol by Shire  and Tegretol by Novartis ; valproate, sold by Abbott Laboratories as Depakine and Sanofi-Aventis as Epilim; Lundbeck’s and Merck’s asenapine.

82,JNJ,UPDATE 3-U.S. FDA approves Roche skin cancer drug Zelboraf," * Diagnostic test to target drug to patients also approved   * Roche to charge $56,400 for course of treatment in U.S.   * Analyst sees peak sales of Zelboraf at $1.5 bln   * Roche shares up nearly 2 pct on Swiss stock exchange  (Adds foundation, analyst comment, price, details)   By Anna Yukhananov   WASHINGTON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - U.S. drug regulators approved a targeted skin cancer drug from Roche Holding ROG.VX, offering new hope for patients with the deadliest form of cancer after years of few options.   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was two months ahead of schedule in approving the drug, under the brand name Zelboraf, along with a companion diagnostic test that identifies which patients have a specific genetic mutation that means they will benefit from the treatment.   Zelboraf was developed in partnership with Daiichi Sankyo (4568.T) and is the second drug to be approved for melanoma this year, after Yervoy from Bristol-Myers Squibb(BMY.N). Prior to 2011, the FDA had not approved a new melanoma drug in 13 years.   Both are expected to top $1 billion in sales for their manufacturers, and analysts at Sanford Bernstein predict that Yervoy will capture 60 percent of the U.S. market versus 40 percent for Zelboraf.   “The FDA’s quick action on this drug approval is important because it gives melanoma patients a new way to fight this deadly disease,” said Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation, about the Roche drug.   “We have seen evidence that targeting gene mutations works. But it also demonstrates the very real challenges researchers still face in offering patients lasting results.”   Advanced melanoma patients taking the Roche twice-daily pill were 63 percent less likely to die from the disease than patients given chemotherapy. However, some patients eventually become resistant to Zelboraf.   “The FDA clearly made it a priority to approve Zelboraf based on the strong clinical data,” said Helvea analyst Karl-Heinz Koch. “Roche will now get the sales from this drug earlier and that’s going to be a bonus for the stock in the second half of the year.   Vontobel analyst Andrew Weiss sees Zelboraf peak sales of 1.2 billion Swiss francs ($1.5 billion).   Shares in Roche rose 1.7 percent in Zurich. Bristol gained 0.5 percent in New York trading.   Melanoma globally afflicts nearly 160,000 new people each year. It can spread quickly to internal organs and average survival is six to nine months.   Roche estimates that around 9,500 of the 70,000 new cases of melanoma expected to be diagnosed in the United States this year will be advanced forms of the skin cancer.   Zelboraf, known clinically as vemurafenib, is designed for patients with tumors that have a mutation in a gene known as BRAF that allows melanoma cells to grow. About half of all melanomas have the genetic aberration the drug targets.   Yervoy, or ipilimumab, sold more quickly than expected after its approval in March. It is an antibody designed to spur the immune system to fight off the melanoma.   The 10 percent of patients who respond to Yervoy often get benefit that can last for many years, in contrast to the relatively short-lived effect of Zelboraf.   While the drugs will compete for market share, Roche and Bristol are also collaborating on a novel clinical trial to see if a combination of the two will yield a more effective treatment for some patients. [ID:nN02237555]   Roche said Zelboraf would cost about $56,400 for a six-month course of treatment in the United States. Bristol’s Yervoy costs $120,000 for a course of treatment. The diagnostic test will cost around $150, according to Paul Brown, president of Roche Diagnostics.   Side effects from Zelboraf include rash, slight hair loss, extreme photosensitivity and joint pain.   Roche filed for U.S. approval of the drug in April and the FDA had to make a decision by Oct. 28. Reuters reported on Aug. 10 that an early nod was likely. [ID:nN1E77917U] The medicine is the first new oncology product from Roche’s Genentech unit since 2004’s launch of lung cancer drug Tarceva.

84,JNJ,IFR-Disney cleans up in US bond market with coupon records," NEW YORK, Aug 18 (IFR) - The Walt Disney Company hit the market with a bond offering on Wednesday and ended up achieving the lowest ever coupons for bonds with maturities of five, 10 and 30 years.   It’s a sign of the times. The market was ripe with possibility when the A2/A/A rated issuer went out to investors yesterday. Treasuries all week have been trading near all time lows. In fact, what has drawn Disney (DIS.N) and this week’s other issuers to market is not necessarily a strong need for cash. The main allure is the ultra-low rates, and credit spreads for top-notch credits have snapped tight.   “Credit spreads on highly coveted names like Walt Disney are back at or close to their tights of the year; we’ve hit new lows across the Treasury curve, new issue concessions have abated and there is a cash-rich investor base,” said Jonathan Fine, managing director and head of investment grade debt syndicate in the Americas at Goldman Sachs. “When you have a confluence of these events issuers are going to break some records.”   Disney printed a US$750m offering of five-year notes with a 1.35% coupon at 99.206 to yield Treasuries plus 60bp. The coupon bests the 1.375% record held by Colgate Palmolive Co (CL.N) since October 29 2010. The US$750m 10-year finished with a 2.75% coupon at 98.717 to yield plus 72bp, beating out the 2.95% coupon achieved by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on August 12 2010 and matched by Colgate on October 29 2010.   Meanwhile, Disney’s US$350m 30-year tranche printed with a 4.375% coupon at 99.01 to yield Treasuries plus 87.5bp. J&J also set the previous 30-year record of 4.50% on August 12 2010. A handful of other issuers tied that level soon thereafter, including Microsoft (MSFT.O), San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison. Most recently Southwestern Public Service Co priced a 4.50% long bond on August 3 2011.   Disney was clearly what a lot of investors were looking for this week.   “You have to be able to check a number of boxes at the moment to get this type of execution in the new issue market: you need to be well known, Single-A or better and non-financial. If you are all of these things then you are ripe for a phenomenal offering,” said Fine.   Disney has always been at the forefront of financing trends. Most noticeably, it was the first corporate issuer ever to print a 100-year bond, when it priced a US$300m fundraising on July 21 1993. That started a trend among certain high-grade issuers that re-emerged over the past year, most recently with a US$300m century bond from University of Southern California that priced on August 10 2011.   Disney’s last trip the high-grade bond market was on May 18 this year. The difference between the Wednesday trade and the May deal had more to do with the changes in the Treasury market than in Disney.   The issuer printed a US$500m offering of 10-year notes in May with a 3.75% coupon, a full percentage point richer than Wednesday’s trade. However, from the point of view of spread it was a more attractive deal for the company. Last time it achieved 60bp over Treasuries compared to 72bp on Wednesday.

86,JNJ,HOW TO PLAY IT: Market turmoil shakes up investor options," THE ISSUE: Three weeks of roller-coaster equity markets have left many investors exhausted and financial advisers searching for answers. We talked to some advisers about real-world options, geared to clients’ risk tolerance.   By Joseph A. Giannone and Jessica Toonkel   NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Income-generating stocks and bonds can provide stability and reassurance during volatile periods.   Andrew Morse, a veteran broker at HighTower Advisors LLC in New York, steers some of his affluent clients toward dividend-paying companies with modest debt loads and operations in faster-growing regions such as Asia.   One such company is McDonald’s Corp. (MCD.N), the $88 billion fast-food giant that pays a nearly 3 percent dividend yield and in July beat estimates by reporting a 5 percent rise in sales.   Todd Morgan, senior managing partner of Bel Air Investment Advisors in Los Angeles, says many of his clients had moved assets to cash and bonds ahead of the recent downturn. That allowed them to redeployed into high-dividend stocks at discounted prices last week.   Investors could do well, he said, with blue chips like Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) shares, each of which yields more than Treasury bonds.   “What would you rather own for the next 10 years?,” asks Morgan, whose firm oversees $6.5 billion.   P&G shares yield 3.45 percent, while Johnson & Johnson stock pays 3.6 percent. By comparison, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was yielding 2.1 percent on Friday.   Investors averse to stock-picking might embrace vehicles such as the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY.P), a passive fund comprised of dividend paying stocks, or the Manning & Napier Dividend Focus mutual fund (MNDFX.O).   The mutual fund is down nearly 10 percent since July 22, and the S&P Dividend ETF is down 12 percent in the same period, smaller declines than the 16 percent drop in the S&P 500 Index.   Exchange-traded funds are generally thought of as efficient vehicles for both small and large players to play the market.   Taking a short position on the $2.7 billion iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG.P) could be a good strategy to profit from Europe’s fiscal woes, said Paul Justice, an ETF analyst at Morningstar.   “Germany is export-driven and if Europe continues to suffer, Germany will suffer disproportionately,” he said.   Investors bearish on the United States and its financial services companies may want to short the $4.8 billion Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF.P), which sank 21 percent in the past month, he said.   Those who expect market volatility to persist can purchase securities based on the CBOE’s Market Volatility Index, such as the $1.3 billion iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures exchange-traded note (VXX.P) The index has roughly doubled since July 22, when the recent market swoon began.   Advisers and clients with a real taste for risk can try leveraged and inverse ETFs, said Tom Lydon, president of Global Trends Investments, an adviser managing $95 million.   “These are for people who are watching the markets every day,” he said. “You can’t just buy them and hold on because they don’t correlate exactly to the market over long periods.”   The Securities and Exchange Commission, FINRA and state securities regulators have issued warnings about the dangers of owning leveraged or inverse ETFs, which amplify risks by using debt and derivatives.   Advisers said it’s important to discuss investments in difficult times.   “Clients are starting to understand that abnormal is normal,” said Howard Sontag, whose New York-based Sontag Advisory LLC manages $5 billion in assets for super-wealthy families. “We cannot control market volatility, but we can build a portfolio that gives our clients some comfort.”  ",8192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/brokers-investing/how-to-play-it-market-turmoil-shakes-up-investor-options-idUSN1E77I0CS20110819
87,JNJ,INSIGHT-DePuy's handling of hip recall sparks questions," * J&J’s DePuy unit hires third party to handle recall   * Unusual move generates criticism from patients, lawyers   * DePuy faces more than 2,000 lawsuits in U.S.   By Toni Clarke   BOSTON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), which could face billions of dollars in costs over an artificial hip recall, is taking an unusual approach to managing the crisis — one that could limit its financial exposure, legal experts say.   J&J’s DePuy Orthopaedics Inc unit recalled its metal ASR hip system a year ago after it failed at a higher-than-expected rate, with some patients experiencing pain, swelling, joint dislocation and sometimes systemic damage to the central nervous system, thyroid and heart.   The company now faces more than 2,000 lawsuits in state and federal court in the United States.   In a highly unusual move, DePuy has hired a third party — Broadspire Services Inc, which manages workers compensation and other medical claims on behalf of insurance companies and employers — to administer patient claims for out-of-pocket medical costs associated with the recall.   The move has prompted debate among industry and legal experts. Some see it as an efficient way to outsource a process that is unrelated to making artificial hips. Others see it as a way for J&J to limit payments while gaining control of medical records and other material that could be used against patients in court.   In general, companies and their lawyers handle recalls directly. They answer patient queries and pay claims for reimbursement. Typically, companies accept a treating physician’s recommendation when it comes to determining if a device should be removed or replaced.   In DePuy’s case, it is Broadspire’s physicians, not the patient’s own doctor, who, in effect, make the final decision on whether a patient’s hip should be replaced. While Broadspire physicians cannot directly override a patient’s doctor in terms of treatment, they make the decision on whether to pay. That can effectively rule out surgery for patients who cannot pay.   “Doctors who are evaluating these cases are being paid indirectly by DePuy, and research suggests that even when we are very well-intentioned we can be influenced by conflicts of interest,” said Kristin Smith-Crowe, associate professor of management at the University of Utah, who specializes in business ethics. “This is a bit of a red flag in terms of the way this situation is set up.”   Lorie Gawreluk, a spokeswoman for DePuy, said Broadspire’s role is entirely benign. The company conducts its own reviews to ensure that a patient’s hip problems are the result of the recall, and not some other cause, such as a fall.   “Similar to the process insurance companies use to evaluate claims from subscribers, medical records are collected by Broadspire if a patient requests financial assistance,” she said in an email. “Broadspire requires no more information than a typical insurance provider would request, and like an insurance provider, Broadspire has a team of reviewers who review claims.”   Patients and lawyers argue that the hip recall claims should not be treated in the same way as a standard medical claim. An insurance company, after all, does not decide whether to reimburse policyholders for medical costs related to a problem it caused itself. Moreover, lawyers representing patients say the amount of information being collected by Broadspire is excessive.   “This is an evolving strategy that is outside the norm of what companies have done in the past,” said Edward Blizzard, partner with the law firm Blizzard, McCarthy & Nabers. Blizzard is representing plaintiffs in the case.   “Normally a company would not get the kind of information Broadspire is asking for until a case was in litigation, and even if the case was in litigation, in no circumstance would the defendant be allowed to have their own physician talk to the patient’s physician privately, as Broadspire is demanding,” he said.    Last August, DePuy wrote to orthopedic surgeons asking them to forward to their patients a package of information about the recall. It contained a form letter from doctor to patient, written by DePuy, asking the patient to set up an appointment to discuss any concerns and to bring with them a signed medical release giving the physician permission to share information with DePuy.   “It is important to share this information with DePuy so that DePuy may contact you directly regarding any additional information regarding the ASR Hip System and process your claims efficiently,” the letter said. “Please complete the form and bring it with you to your next appointment.”   DePuy offered doctors $50 for each completed set of forms.   “I have been doing this work for 35 years and it is almost unprecedented for a large corporate defendant to run out and preemptively attempt to identify potential claimants,” said Alex MacDonald, a partner at MacDonald Rothweiler Eisenberg, who helped negotiate billions of dollars in settlements over the diet-drug cocktail Fen-Phen. He is not representing clients in the DePuy case.   “J&J is reaching out to doctors and asking them to use their influence with their patients in the hope that the doctor will help identify potential claimants in a lawsuit,” MacDonald said.   DePuy, which is based in Warsaw, Indiana, denies that it is doing anything out of the ordinary, or that it might be seeking to influence doctors with its upfront offer of payment, as some critics charge.   “It is standard practice for, and indeed healthcare professionals require, reimbursement for the costs of producing the medical records,” Gawreluk said.   But some doctors say they have not previously been asked by a product manufacturer to persuade patients to give up their privacy rights, or been directly offered payment to do so.   “It made me uncomfortable,” said Mark Barba, an orthopedic surgeon at Rockford Orthopedic Associates, a surgical center in Rockford, Illinois. “I’ve never faced anything like that before. Never.”   Some 93,000 people have been implanted with DePuy’s ASR hip system worldwide.   With wear, the grinding of the hip’s ball-and-socket structure causes metal debris to collect in the tissue surrounding the implant, damaging muscle and tendons and complicating replacement surgery. In some cases, metal ions released into the blood causes broader health problems.   Aubie Brennan, a 56-year-old teacher on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, had replacement surgery for each hip in 2007 and 2008 due to bone deterioration.   In 2009, he began to be plagued by flu-like symptoms, rashes, swollen lips and debilitating fatigue. Doctors were unable to locate the cause. They thought he might have allergies, or be depressed, or poisoned by a substance in the ocean surrounding his home.   But last August, Brennan said he received a letter from his health insurance company, Kaiser Permanente, alerting him to the recall and urging him to come in for tests. These showed that his left hip was crooked and that his blood contained significantly elevated levels of chromium and cobalt ions. The surgeon told him he wasn’t sure if the elevated metal levels were causing his symptoms, and to return for further testing in six months.   Brennan could not wait. He sought a second opinion, and in February met with a surgeon at The Queen’s Medical Center in Honolulu, the leading medical referral center in the Pacific Basin.   “He looked at my results and said, ‘I think you need surgery, on both hips, and you need it now,’” Brennan said. He declined to name either surgeon.   The Honolulu surgeon was not part of Kaiser’s network, so Kaiser declined to pay, Brennan said. He turned to Broadspire for reimbursement.   Broadspire told Brennan it would not agree in advance to pay. His only option would be to pay for the surgery himself. Then he would have to submit the doctor’s report to Broadspire, whose physicians would review the case and make a decision on whether the procedure had been necessary.   Brennan could not afford to pay the $43,467 that the surgery would have cost — or take the risk that Broadspire would decline coverage. He canceled the scheduled procedure.   “I was really devastated,” he said. “Emotionally, and as far as my job went, it really devastated me.”   Ultimately, Kaiser reversed itself and agreed to pay for the surgery, which took place in July.   Broadspire would not comment on individual claims, or its payment process in general. DePuy said patients first file for reimbursement through their insurance company, and DePuy later repays the insurance company.   Over the past two years, J&J — for decades one of the most trusted brands in America — has recalled more than 50 products, ranging from Children’s Tylenol to insulin cartridges to contact lenses. The company’s handling of the recalls has in some cases sparked Congressional and federal criminal investigations.   Particularly disturbing to regulators was an older “phantom recall” of painkiller Motrin. J&J hired a contractor to secretly buy the product from stores well before it alerted the general public in 2009 that the pills did not dissolve properly.   To critics, DePuy’s handling of its hip implant recall is designed to save money by potentially settling claims with patients before they fully understand their legal rights, or the likely cost of their hip-related medical costs in the future.   DePuy is adamant in its denial.   “To be very clear: the sole purpose of the Broadspire process is to assist patients and health care providers as efficiently as possible,” Gawreluk said.   David Prince, professor of law at William Mitchell College of Law, said that while the hiring of Broadspire may make economic sense for J&J by saving the company the trouble of gearing up and organizing in-house, it also has the effect of distancing the company from patients.   “By pawning this process off on a third party, they don’t have to deal face to face with patients, and may be less sensible to the human cost of what their product has done,” he said.   Prince, who has represented both plaintiffs and defendants in the past and specializes in product liability, said he can see both perspectives.   “In a larger sense, this is a clash between the individual and his or her needs, and the broad corporate interest,” he said. “If I were a patient I’d be very unhappy if someone I trusted, my own doctor, recommended a procedure and someone stood in the way. I would find that intolerable.”   On the other hand, he said, “You can see how the company wants to make sure they only pay what they consider in their own mind legitimate claims.”   J&J has taken special charges of about $400 million associated with the ASR recall through the second quarter of this year. The company’s litigation expense also includes a component for increased product liability reserves related to the recall. Gawreluk declined to quantify that component or say what DePuy has paid out so far in claims.   Some experts say the ultimate cost to J&J could run to the billions of dollars.   In January 2001, Swiss medical device maker Sulzer Medica AG recalled a hip implant after a manufacturing glitch caused it to loosen. The company settled the case in 2002 for $1 billion. Of the 31,000 patients who received the Sulzer Medica implants, more than 2,760 had them replaced.   The DePuy recall is three times larger and much more complex. The revision rate has not yet been established, but data from a study released in March by the British Orthopaedic Association and the British Hip Society showed the ASR system had a failure rate of up to 49 percent after six years — nearly four times the rate cited by DePuy when it recalled the device.   “This is the absolute worst thing that ever happened to my practice,” Barba, the Rockford surgeon, said of the recall. “It keeps me up at night wondering how to treat these patients whose future is so uncertain. It has been difficult for all of us emotionally.”  (Additional reporting by Debra Sherman in Chicago; Editing by Michele Gershberg, Matthew Lewis)   ",8212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/depuy/insight-depuys-handling-of-hip-recall-sparks-questions-idUSN1E77K02F20110821
88,JNJ,Data may prove Bristol and Pfizer drug a winner,"LONDON (Reuters) - Despite being third to market, a new bloodthinner from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer may become the biggest seller in an emerging multibillion-dollar class of drugs for preventing strokes in heart patients.  Eliquis, or apixaban, is set to steal the limelight at Europe’s top medical meeting next week — and if the data are as strong as many industry analysts expect, sales forecasts for the medicine are likely to jump.  Excitement over Eliquis has been growing since June when headline results showed it was better and safer than the decades-old warfarin in preventing strokes in patients with dangerously irregular heart rhythms.  Just how much better will become clear on August 28 when detailed data from a 18,000-patient clinical trial are presented at the European Society of Cardiology annual meeting in Paris.  In addition to reducing stroke and bleeding risk, there is a chance that Eliquis could be the first oral anticoagulant to show a statistically significant improvement in mortality over warfarin in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients.  That would be “the icing on the cake,” according to drug industry analysts at Jefferies, while the team at Barclays believes it would allow Eliquis to grab 50 percent of a likely $9 billion-a-year AF stroke prevention market by 2021.  Industry analysts, on average, currently expect 2015 sales of $1.6 billion for the product, which is due to be submitted for regulatory approval this year, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.  That is less than the $3 billion forecast for Xarelto, from Bayer and Johnson & Johnson, suggesting the competitive landscape will realign if Eliquis lives up to its promise in Paris.  “What’s at stake is whether or not they are going to be best in class for atrial fibrillation,” said Damien Conover, analyst at Morningstar.  “Given that it’s such a giant market, it’s important to know whether or not they are going to be splitting it more equally or if they really do have best-in-class status which means they’ll get the lion’s share of the market.”  Confirmation of strong efficacy and low bleeding risk could boost Bristol-Myers shares some 5 percent and lift Pfizer by 2-3 percent, according to Chris Schott of JP Morgan.  On the flipside, confidence may start to ebb away in prospects for Xarelto and a third drug, Pradaxa, which is sold by privately held Boehringer Ingelheim and is currently the only approved oral alternative to warfarin in stroke prevention.  Xarelto and Pradaxa are both already approved for stopping clots after knee and hip surgery but stroke prevention in AF is the biggest opportunity for the new oral coagulants, which are also being studied for other heart conditions.  In all, the warfarin replacement market could be a $10-20 billion opportunity, analysts estimate, although low-cost warfarin — a notoriously problematic drug — is not going to disappear altogether, with patients who are well controlled on the old medicine likely to stay on it.  Success with Eliquis would be a boon for Bristol-Myers and Pfizer, which together face more than $30 billion in revenue loss due to patent expiries through 2016, according to Barclays.  It would underpin broader confidence that Big Pharma can still discover promising new medicines, despite the pipeline drought of recent years.  Also in focus at the Paris congress will be Roche’s dalcetrapib, which is being developed to raise “good” HDL cholesterol.  The Swiss drugmaker is still more than a year away from being able to generate definitive data on the medicine, but doctors and analysts will be watching closely for news from two relatively small trials. A promising scientific abstract was released for one of these at the weekend.

89,JNJ,Insight: DePuy's handling of hip recall sparks questions,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson, which could face billions of dollars in costs over an artificial hip recall, is taking an unusual approach to managing the crisis — one that could limit its financial exposure, legal experts say.  J&J’s DePuy Orthopaedics Inc unit recalled its metal ASR hip system a year ago after it failed at a higher-than-expected rate, with some patients experiencing pain, swelling, joint dislocation and sometimes systemic damage to the central nervous system, thyroid and heart.  The company now faces more than 2,000 lawsuits in state and federal court in the United States.  In a highly unusual move, DePuy has hired a third party — Broadspire Services Inc, which manages workers compensation and other medical claims on behalf of insurance companies and employers — to administer patient claims for out-of-pocket medical costs associated with the recall.  The move has prompted debate among industry and legal experts. Some see it as an efficient way to outsource a process that is unrelated to making artificial hips. Others see it as a way for J&J to limit payments while gaining control of medical records and other material that could be used against patients in court.  In general, companies and their lawyers handle recalls directly. They answer patient queries and pay claims for reimbursement. Typically, companies accept a treating physician’s recommendation when it comes to determining if a device should be removed or replaced.  In DePuy’s case, it is Broadspire’s physicians, not the patient’s own doctor, who, in effect, make the final decision on whether a patient’s hip should be replaced. While Broadspire physicians cannot directly override a patient’s doctor in terms of treatment, they make the decision on whether to pay. That can effectively rule out surgery for patients who cannot pay.  “Doctors who are evaluating these cases are being paid indirectly by DePuy, and research suggests that even when we are very well-intentioned we can be influenced by conflicts of interest,” said Kristin Smith-Crowe, associate professor of management at the University of Utah, who specializes in business ethics. “This is a bit of a red flag in terms of the way this situation is set up.”  Lorie Gawreluk, a spokeswoman for DePuy, said Broadspire’s role is entirely benign. The company conducts its own reviews to ensure that a patient’s hip problems are the result of the recall, and not some other cause, such as a fall.  “Similar to the process insurance companies use to evaluate claims from subscribers, medical records are collected by Broadspire if a patient requests financial assistance,” she said in an email. “Broadspire requires no more information than a typical insurance provider would request, and like an insurance provider, Broadspire has a team of reviewers who review claims.”  Patients and lawyers argue that the hip recall claims should not be treated in the same way as a standard medical claim. An insurance company, after all, does not decide whether to reimburse policyholders for medical costs related to a problem it caused itself. Moreover, lawyers representing patients say the amount of information being collected by Broadspire is excessive.  “This is an evolving strategy that is outside the norm of what companies have done in the past,” said Edward Blizzard, partner with the law firm Blizzard, McCarthy & Nabers. Blizzard is representing plaintiffs in the case.  “Normally a company would not get the kind of information Broadspire is asking for until a case was in litigation, and even if the case was in litigation, in no circumstance would the defendant be allowed to have their own physician talk to the patient’s physician privately, as Broadspire is demanding,” he said.  Last August, DePuy wrote to orthopedic surgeons asking them to forward to their patients a package of information about the recall. It contained a form letter from doctor to patient, written by DePuy, asking the patient to set up an appointment to discuss any concerns and to bring with them a signed medical release giving the physician permission to share information with DePuy.  “It is important to share this information with DePuy so that DePuy may contact you directly regarding any additional information regarding the ASR Hip System and process your claims efficiently,” the letter said. “Please complete the form and bring it with you to your next appointment.”  DePuy offered doctors $50 for each completed set of forms.  “I have been doing this work for 35 years and it is almost unprecedented for a large corporate defendant to run out and preemptively attempt to identify potential claimants,” said Alex MacDonald, a partner at MacDonald Rothweiler Eisenberg, who helped negotiate billions of dollars in settlements over the diet-drug cocktail Fen-Phen. He is not representing clients in the DePuy case.  “J&J is reaching out to doctors and asking them to use their influence with their patients in the hope that the doctor will help identify potential claimants in a lawsuit,” MacDonald said.  DePuy, which is based in Warsaw, Indiana, denies that it is doing anything out of the ordinary, or that it might be seeking to influence doctors with its upfront offer of payment, as some critics charge.  “It is standard practice for, and indeed healthcare professionals require, reimbursement for the costs of producing the medical records,” Gawreluk said.  But some doctors say they have not previously been asked by a product manufacturer to persuade patients to give up their privacy rights, or been directly offered payment to do so.  “It made me uncomfortable,” said Mark Barba, an orthopedic surgeon at Rockford Orthopedic Associates, a surgical center in Rockford, Illinois. “I’ve never faced anything like that before. Never.”  Some 93,000 people have been implanted with DePuy’s ASR hip system worldwide.  With wear, the grinding of the hip’s ball-and-socket structure causes metal debris to collect in the tissue surrounding the implant, damaging muscle and tendons and complicating replacement surgery. In some cases, metal ions released into the blood causes broader health problems.  Aubie Brennan, a 56-year-old teacher on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, had replacement surgery for each hip in 2007 and 2008 due to bone deterioration.  In 2009, he began to be plagued by flu-like symptoms, rashes, swollen lips and debilitating fatigue. Doctors were unable to locate the cause. They thought he might have allergies, or be depressed, or poisoned by a substance in the ocean surrounding his home.  But last August, Brennan said he received a letter from his health insurance company, Kaiser Permanente, alerting him to the recall and urging him to come in for tests. These showed that his left hip was crooked and that his blood contained significantly elevated levels of chromium and cobalt ions. The surgeon told him he wasn’t sure if the elevated metal levels were causing his symptoms, and to return for further testing in six months.  Brennan could not wait. He sought a second opinion, and in February met with a surgeon at The Queen’s Medical Center in Honolulu, the leading medical referral center in the Pacific Basin.  “He looked at my results and said, ‘I think you need surgery, on both hips, and you need it now,’” Brennan said. He declined to name either surgeon.  The Honolulu surgeon was not part of Kaiser’s network, so Kaiser declined to pay, Brennan said. He turned to Broadspire for reimbursement.  Broadspire told Brennan it would not agree in advance to pay. His only option would be to pay for the surgery himself. Then he would have to submit the doctor’s report to Broadspire, whose physicians would review the case and make a decision on whether the procedure had been necessary.  Brennan could not afford to pay the $43,467 that the surgery would have cost — or take the risk that Broadspire would decline coverage. He canceled the scheduled procedure.  “I was really devastated,” he said. “Emotionally, and as far as my job went, it really devastated me.”  Ultimately, Kaiser reversed itself and agreed to pay for the surgery, which took place in July.  Broadspire would not comment on individual claims, or its payment process in general. DePuy said patients first file for reimbursement through their insurance company, and DePuy later repays the insurance company.  Over the past two years, J&J — for decades one of the most trusted brands in America — has recalled more than 50 products, ranging from Children’s Tylenol to insulin cartridges to contact lenses. The company’s handling of the recalls has in some cases sparked Congressional and federal criminal investigations.  Particularly disturbing to regulators was an older “phantom recall” of painkiller Motrin. J&J hired a contractor to secretly buy the product from stores well before it alerted the general public in 2009 that the pills did not dissolve properly.  To critics, DePuy’s handling of its hip implant recall is designed to save money by potentially settling claims with patients before they fully understand their legal rights, or the likely cost of their hip-related medical costs in the future.  DePuy is adamant in its denial.  “To be very clear: the sole purpose of the Broadspire process is to assist patients and health care providers as efficiently as possible,” Gawreluk said.  David Prince, professor of law at William Mitchell College of Law, said that while the hiring of Broadspire may make economic sense for J&J by saving the company the trouble of gearing up and organizing in-house, it also has the effect of distancing the company from patients.  “By pawning this process off on a third party, they don’t have to deal face to face with patients, and may be less sensible to the human cost of what their product has done,” he said.  Prince, who has represented both plaintiffs and defendants in the past and specializes in product liability, said he can see both perspectives.  “In a larger sense, this is a clash between the individual and his or her needs, and the broad corporate interest,” he said. “If I were a patient I’d be very unhappy if someone I trusted, my own doctor, recommended a procedure and someone stood in the way. I would find that intolerable.”  On the other hand, he said, “You can see how the company wants to make sure they only pay what they consider in their own mind legitimate claims.”  J&J has taken special charges of about $400 million associated with the ASR recall through the second quarter of this year. The company’s litigation expense also includes a component for increased product liability reserves related to the recall. Gawreluk declined to quantify that component or say what DePuy has paid out so far in claims.  Some experts say the ultimate cost to J&J could run to the billions of dollars.  In January 2001, Swiss medical device maker Sulzer Medica AG recalled a hip implant after a manufacturing glitch caused it to loosen. The company settled the case in 2002 for $1 billion. Of the 31,000 patients who received the Sulzer Medica implants, more than 2,760 had them replaced.  The DePuy recall is three times larger and much more complex. The revision rate has not yet been established, but data from a study released in March by the British Orthopaedic Association and the British Hip Society showed the ASR system had a failure rate of up to 49 percent after six years — nearly four times the rate cited by DePuy when it recalled the device.  “This is the absolute worst thing that ever happened to my practice,” Barba, the Rockford surgeon, said of the recall. “It keeps me up at night wondering how to treat these patients whose future is so uncertain. It has been difficult for all of us emotionally.”  ",8222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-depuy/insight-depuys-handling-of-hip-recall-sparks-questions-idUSTRE77L35H20110822

92,JNJ,Market turmoil shakes up investor options,"THE ISSUE: Three weeks of roller-coaster equity markets have left many investors exhausted and financial advisers searching for answers. We talked to some advisers about real-world options, geared to clients’ risk tolerance.  By Joseph A. Giannone and Jessica Toonkel  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Income-generating stocks and bonds can provide stability and reassurance during volatile periods.  Andrew Morse, a veteran broker at HighTower Advisors LLC in New York, steers some of his affluent clients toward dividend-paying companies with modest debt loads and operations in faster-growing regions such as Asia.  One such company is McDonald’s Corp., the $88 billion fast-food giant that pays a nearly 3 percent dividend yield and in July beat estimates by reporting a 5 percent rise in sales.  Todd Morgan, senior managing partner of Bel Air Investment Advisors in Los Angeles, says many of his clients had moved assets to cash and bonds ahead of the recent downturn. That allowed them to redeployed into high-dividend stocks at discounted prices last week.  Investors could do well, he said, with blue chips like Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson shares, each of which yields more than Treasury bonds.  “What would you rather own for the next 10 years?,” asks Morgan, whose firm oversees $6.5 billion.  P&G shares yield 3.45 percent, while Johnson & Johnson stock pays 3.6 percent. By comparison, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was yielding 2.1 percent on Friday.  Investors averse to stock-picking might embrace vehicles such as the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF, a passive fund comprised of dividend paying stocks, or the Manning & Napier Dividend Focus mutual fund.  The mutual fund is down nearly 10 percent since July 22, and the S&P Dividend ETF is down 12 percent in the same period, smaller declines than the 16 percent drop in the S&P 500 Index.  Exchange-traded funds are generally thought of as efficient vehicles for both small and large players to play the market.  Taking a short position on the $2.7 billion iShares MSCI Germany ETF could be a good strategy to profit from Europe’s fiscal woes, said Paul Justice, an ETF analyst at Morningstar.  “Germany is export-driven and if Europe continues to suffer, Germany will suffer disproportionately,” he said.  Investors bearish on the United States and its financial services companies may want to short the $4.8 billion Financial Select Sector SPDR, which sank 21 percent in the past month, he said.  Those who expect market volatility to persist can purchase securities based on the CBOE’s Market Volatility Index, such as the $1.3 billion iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures exchange-traded note The index has roughly doubled since July 22, when the recent market swoon began.  Advisers and clients with a real taste for risk can try leveraged and inverse ETFs, said Tom Lydon, president of Global Trends Investments, an adviser managing $95 million.  “These are for people who are watching the markets every day,” he said. “You can’t just buy them and hold on because they don’t correlate exactly to the market over long periods.”  The Securities and Exchange Commission, FINRA and state securities regulators have issued warnings about the dangers of owning leveraged or inverse ETFs, which amplify risks by using debt and derivatives.  Advisers said it’s important to discuss investments in difficult times.  “Clients are starting to understand that abnormal is normal,” said Howard Sontag, whose New York-based Sontag Advisory LLC manages $5 billion in assets for super-wealthy families. “We cannot control market volatility, but we can build a portfolio that gives our clients some comfort.”  ",8222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brokers-investing/market-turmoil-shakes-up-investor-options-idUSTRE77L2HH20110822
93,JNJ,RPT-INSIGHT-DePuy's handling of hip recall sparks questions," (This is a copy of a story originally transmitted on Aug. 21)   * J&J’s DePuy unit hires third party to handle recall   * Unusual move generates criticism from patients, lawyers   * DePuy faces more than 2,000 lawsuits in U.S.   By Toni Clarke   BOSTON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), which could face billions of dollars in costs over an artificial hip recall, is taking an unusual approach to managing the crisis — one that could limit its financial exposure, legal experts say.   J&J’s DePuy Orthopaedics Inc unit recalled its metal ASR hip system a year ago after it failed at a higher-than-expected rate, with some patients experiencing pain, swelling, joint dislocation and sometimes systemic damage to the central nervous system, thyroid and heart.   The company now faces more than 2,000 lawsuits in state and federal court in the United States.   In a highly unusual move, DePuy has hired a third party — Broadspire Services Inc, which manages workers compensation and other medical claims on behalf of insurance companies and employers — to administer patient claims for out-of-pocket medical costs associated with the recall.   The move has prompted debate among industry and legal experts. Some see it as an efficient way to outsource a process that is unrelated to making artificial hips. Others see it as a way for J&J to limit payments while gaining control of medical records and other material that could be used against patients in court.   In general, companies and their lawyers handle recalls directly. They answer patient queries and pay claims for reimbursement. Typically, companies accept a treating physician’s recommendation when it comes to determining if a device should be removed or replaced.   In DePuy’s case, it is Broadspire’s physicians, not the patient’s own doctor, who, in effect, make the final decision on whether a patient’s hip should be replaced. While Broadspire physicians cannot directly override a patient’s doctor in terms of treatment, they make the decision on whether to pay. That can effectively rule out surgery for patients who cannot pay.   “Doctors who are evaluating these cases are being paid indirectly by DePuy, and research suggests that even when we are very well-intentioned we can be influenced by conflicts of interest,” said Kristin Smith-Crowe, associate professor of management at the University of Utah, who specializes in business ethics. “This is a bit of a red flag in terms of the way this situation is set up.”   Lorie Gawreluk, a spokeswoman for DePuy, said Broadspire’s role is entirely benign. The company conducts its own reviews to ensure that a patient’s hip problems are the result of the recall, and not some other cause, such as a fall.   “Similar to the process insurance companies use to evaluate claims from subscribers, medical records are collected by Broadspire if a patient requests financial assistance,” she said in an email. “Broadspire requires no more information than a typical insurance provider would request, and like an insurance provider, Broadspire has a team of reviewers who review claims.”   Patients and lawyers argue that the hip recall claims should not be treated in the same way as a standard medical claim. An insurance company, after all, does not decide whether to reimburse policyholders for medical costs related to a problem it caused itself. Moreover, lawyers representing patients say the amount of information being collected by Broadspire is excessive.   “This is an evolving strategy that is outside the norm of what companies have done in the past,” said Edward Blizzard, partner with the law firm Blizzard, McCarthy & Nabers. Blizzard is representing plaintiffs in the case.   “Normally a company would not get the kind of information Broadspire is asking for until a case was in litigation, and even if the case was in litigation, in no circumstance would the defendant be allowed to have their own physician talk to the patient’s physician privately, as Broadspire is demanding,” he said.    Last August, DePuy wrote to orthopedic surgeons asking them to forward to their patients a package of information about the recall. It contained a form letter from doctor to patient, written by DePuy, asking the patient to set up an appointment to discuss any concerns and to bring with them a signed medical release giving the physician permission to share information with DePuy.   “It is important to share this information with DePuy so that DePuy may contact you directly regarding any additional information regarding the ASR Hip System and process your claims efficiently,” the letter said. “Please complete the form and bring it with you to your next appointment.”   DePuy offered doctors $50 for each completed set of forms.   “I have been doing this work for 35 years and it is almost unprecedented for a large corporate defendant to run out and preemptively attempt to identify potential claimants,” said Alex MacDonald, a partner at MacDonald Rothweiler Eisenberg, who helped negotiate billions of dollars in settlements over the diet-drug cocktail Fen-Phen. He is not representing clients in the DePuy case.   “J&J is reaching out to doctors and asking them to use their influence with their patients in the hope that the doctor will help identify potential claimants in a lawsuit,” MacDonald said.   DePuy, which is based in Warsaw, Indiana, denies that it is doing anything out of the ordinary, or that it might be seeking to influence doctors with its upfront offer of payment, as some critics charge.   “It is standard practice for, and indeed healthcare professionals require, reimbursement for the costs of producing the medical records,” Gawreluk said.   But some doctors say they have not previously been asked by a product manufacturer to persuade patients to give up their privacy rights, or been directly offered payment to do so.   “It made me uncomfortable,” said Mark Barba, an orthopedic surgeon at Rockford Orthopedic Associates, a surgical center in Rockford, Illinois. “I’ve never faced anything like that before. Never.” ",8222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/depuy/rpt-insight-depuys-handling-of-hip-recall-sparks-questions-idUSN1E77K03Y20110822
94,JNJ,No major heart risk seen in new psoriasis drugs,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A new, highly effective class of psoriasis drugs did not appear to raise the risk of heart problems in a review of published studies, but the analysis may not have been big enough to detect rare cases, U.S. researchers said.  Abbott Laboratories pulled its U.S. and European marketing applications for one of the drugs in January, known as briakinumab [ID:nN14150334], due to concerns raised by U.S. regulators.  The drug is part of a new class of treatments known as anti-IL-12/23 agents that have been shown to be highly effective at treating psoriasis, an autoimmune disease marked by well-defined patches of red raised skin.  Patients with severe psoriasis are already at increased risk of heart attacks, and doctors are worried the new treatments may increase this risk.  Abbott’s decision also raised concerns about Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara or ustekinumb, the first drug in the class to win marketing approval.  “We’re concerned about the apparent excess in cardiovascular events,” said Caitriona Ryan of the Baylor Research Institute in Dallas, whose study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday.  Ryan and colleagues analyzed data from 22 randomized clinical trials of anti-IL-12/23 and anti-TNF drugs to treat chronic plaque psoriasis, the most common form of psoriasis.  The older drugs block tumor necrosis factor-alpha or TNF-alpha, a protein involved in inflammation. The newer drugs targets two different inflammatory proteins — interleukin 12 and interleukin 23.  Anti-TNF drugs in the study included Abbott’s Humira or adalimumab, Pfizer’s Enbrel or etanercept and Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade or infliximab.  Ryan’s team found that during the active portion of the clinical trials they reviewed, 10 out of the more than 3,179 patients who were treated with anti-IL-12/23 had a major cardiac event, such as a heart attack, stroke or death related to heart disease, compared with no heart problems in the 1,474 patients treated with a placebo.  Among patients treated with the older anti-TNF drugs, only 1 of the 3,858 patients had a major cardiac problem compared with 1 of the 1,812 patients treated with placebo.  Ryan told Reuters that although the study did not show a statistically significant increase in heart problems, it was likely not large enough to detect these rare events.  Dr. Christopher Ritchlin, a rheumatologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center, who has seen the findings but was not involved with the study, said the analysis does not ease his concerns about drugs in this class.  “There are some safety signals you are seeing in the treatment groups that are not in the placebo groups. I’m not saying there is a definite association, but there is smoke here,” he said.  Ryan said the work exposes flaws in the design of clinical trials, which are powered to show differences in the effectiveness of drugs, but not to identify rare safety problems.  What is needed, she said, is some form of regulatory oversight of drugs after they win marketing approval, beyond the current system in which individual companies submit reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  “We have to find a way of being able to systematically gather safety data for these agents after they are on the market,” Ryan said.

96,JNJ,Sanofi arm to pay $109 million for unit of Universal: sources,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s Aventis Pharma AVPH.NS, a unit of French drug maker Sanofi (SASY.PA), is close to buying the over-the-counter business of Universal Medicare for about 5 billion rupees ($109.5 million), two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.  A deal, which covers about 30 brands sold by unlisted India-based Universal Medicare, is expected to be signed in a day or two and would boost the French company’s over-the-counter business in India, the sources said.  The products included in the deal have annual sales of 1 billion-1.15 billion rupees, the sources said.  “Sanofi’s OTC business in India was quite nominal ... and the products are profit making,” one of the sources said, declining to be identified because the details were not yet public.  Over-the-counter products made by Indian firms have been acquisition targets for multinational drug companies looking to expand their footprint in the fast-growing market.  The over-the-counter products segment in Indian is valued at roughly 20-30 billion rupees and is growing at 17-18 percent annually, faster than the 12-15 percent growth in the broader pharmaceutical sector, according to ICICI Securities analyst Siddhant Khandekar  “Sanofi has been looking for OTC brands and this is just like grabbing an opportunity for them,” he said.  “Issues related to prescriptions and advertising do not affect this segment,” he said.  In December, British consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) agreed to buy privately-held Indian firm Paras Pharmaceuticals, which makes a number of medications, for about $726 million.  In May, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) agreed to buy several over-the-counter medicines sold in Russia from India’s JB Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Ltd (JBCH.NS) for about $260 million.  Earlier, the Economic Times reported that Sanofi was in advanced talks for a strategic tie-up with Universal Medicare, which makes popular cod liver oil capsules brand Seacod.  The acquisition has a medium-term non-compete clause for Universal Medicare and also involves the transfer of related marketing and distribution operations to Aventis Pharma, the sources said.  A Sanofi spokeswoman declined to comment, while officials of Universal could not be immediately be reached for comment.  Shares of Aventis Pharma, which have gained 6.2 percent this year, compared to a 12.4 percent drop in the broader India healthcare index .BSEHC, were trading down 1.4 percent at 2,034.05 rupees at 2:07 a.m. EDT in a weak Mumbai market on Tuesday.  Aventis Pharma reported net profit of 2.31 billion rupees for the year ended December 2010 on net sales of 10.85 billion rupees.

99,JNJ,"New Bristol, Pfizer clot drug saves lives in study","PARIS (Reuters) - An experimental anti-clotting drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer saved more lives than standard treatment warfarin in a major study, giving it an edge over rivals in an emerging multibillion-dollar market.  Although Eliquis will be third to market among a wave of new oral anticoagulants, the data presented Sunday at Europe’s biggest medical meeting means it could now be viewed as the best in class.  People with dangerously irregular heart rhythms given Eliquis were 21 percent less likely to suffer strokes than those on decades-old warfarin, a problematic drug first developed as rat poison that requires regular blood tests.  It also produced a 31 percent relative reduction in the risk of major bleeding — especially bleeding in the brain — and an 11 percent reduction in risk of death from any cause, results from a 18,000-patient study lasting nearly two years showed.  The mortality benefit only just reached statistical significance but the finding puts Eliquis ahead of its two key rivals by demonstrating superiority to warfarin on all three counts of effectiveness, safety and saving lives.  That is likely to be seized on by Bristol and Pfizer in an upcoming marketing fight with Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa — currently the only approved alternative to warfarin in stroke prevention — and Xarelto, from Bayer and Johnson & Johnson, which is expected to be approved shortly.  “It gives a lot of confidence when you see a drug that reduces mortality. That’s another feather in the cap,” Dr Chris Granger of Duke University Medical Center, who led the study, told Reuters.  The result means that giving Eliquis rather than warfarin for 1.8 years — the average length of the study — would prevent eight deaths for each 1,000 people treated.  All three new drugs are vying for a share of a warfarin-replacement market that industry analysts estimate could be worth $10-$20 billion a year by the end of the decade.  Currently, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters Pharma expect 2015 sales of $1.6 billion for Eliquis, or apixaban, which is due to be submitted for approval later this year.  That is less than the $3 billion forecast for Xarelto and some predict the balance will now shift toward Eliquis.  “The bleeding profile is spectacular and that’s what is going to drive market share,” said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at ISI Group, who sees Eliquis taking at least 60 percent of the stroke prevention market.  Excitement over Eliquis has grown since June when headline results showed it was better and safer than warfarin. How much better, however, only became clear Sunday when the data was unveiled at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) annual meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  In an editorial in the journal, Dr Jessica Mega of Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital said the results were “impressive” but she cautioned it was difficult to make comparisons between different drugs, due to variations in the clinical trials.  Doctors attending the ESC meeting said the new drugs would upend the landscape for treating patients with atrial fibrillation, whose irregular heartbeats can cause blood to pool, increasing their risk of blood clots and strokes.  “It is another dagger in the heart for warfarin as an anticoagulation treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke,” said Dr Ralph Brindis.  Brindis, a senior adviser for Northern California Kaiser Permanente and immediate past president of the American College of Cardiology, said Eliquis had scored a “home run,” although it and the other new anticoagulants still faced challenges.  In particular, he is concerned about adherence to medical treatment among elderly patients, as doctors may be less able to ensure they are taking drugs correctly once they do not need regular blood tests. For such patients, once-daily Xarelto may be a better bet than twice-daily Eliquis or Pradaxa, providing a niche market opportunity for Bayer and J&J.  Seamus Fernandez, an industry analyst at Leerink Swann, said Eliquis was now “extremely well-positioned” to be the top drug and Pradaxa was the product most likely to lose out. He expects stroke prevention to be a $7-9 billion market globally, with other uses of the new oral anticoagulants worth $3-6 billion.  In a discussion at the congress, Dr Michael Ezekowitz of the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research in Pennsylvania said the Eliquis trial results were a “landmark” that confirmed a new wave of drugs was about to change the medical landscape.  “We’re in a new era,” Ekekowitz, who was not involved in the latest research, told a packed conference hall in Paris.  Still, many cardiologists said they would not rush to switch existing patients who are well-controlled on warfarin — a cheap generic medicine — to the new and expensive branded products.  Pradaxa costs $6.75 wholesale for a day’s treatment in the United States, although it is less in other markets.

103,JNJ,Consumer groups: Stop sale of J&J; silicone breast implants," * FDA meeting on follow-up studies for implants   * Consumer groups say not enough long-term safety data   By Anna Yukhananov   GAITHERSBURG, Md., Aug 30 (Reuters) - Consumer advocates asked U.S. health regulators to take silicone breast implants made by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) off the market because the company has not been able to provide enough long-term safety data.   The groups spoke on Tuesday at a two-day U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel meeting to discuss follow-up safety studies for silicone implants that have already been approved for sale. The FDA said the issue of product removal was not under consideration during the meeting.   But groups including the National Organization for Women Foundation and the National Women’s Health Network pressed their case for removing Johnson & Johnson’s product from the market.   The FDA approved silicone gel-filled breast implants sold by Allergan (AGN.N) and Johnson & Johnson’s Mentor unit in 2006, on condition both companies follow 40,000 women for 10 years to look at safety issues, as well as extend smaller pre-approval studies.   Allergan has collected preliminary two-year data for 60 percent of participants, while Mentor has collected three-year data for only 21 percent.   “It’s unacceptable that many patients Mentor and Allergan were supposed to track were lost,” said Jan Erickson, of the National Organization for Women Foundation.   “Mentor’s approval should be rescinded right away. And Allergan should be required to conduct further studies.”   There were almost 400,000 breast enlargement or reconstruction procedures in the United States in 2010, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. That includes silicone and saline implants.   In June, the FDA said the risks of breast implants are well understood, after looking at the companies’ results as well as reports of negative events and scientific literature. It said women who get silicone implants are likely to need additional surgery within 10 years. [ID:nN1E75L12N]   The agency had banned silicone implants for most U.S. women in 1992 after some said the devices leaked and made them chronically ill.   During the Tuesday meeting, patients complained of side effects such as rupturing or hardening of the device, and said the companies’ long-term studies could be biased against patients who have problems.   In addressing low response rates, representatives of both companies said the studies had perhaps over-reached by trying to keep track of so many patients, and by requiring each to fill out a 27-page questionnaire each year.   Mentor also said it may have had particularly low response rates because the company made patients participate in the study as a condition of getting an implant, but later changed it to voluntary participation.   “In retrospect, it’s perhaps not surprising that if a patient or surgeon enrolls because they are required to, and then a patient is told because of voluntary consent they’re not ... that might contribute to low follow-up rates,” said Dr. John Canady, medical director at Mentor, when asked if the company’s study had any design flaws.   “That’s something we would go back to change, but obviously can’t in this study.”   Cynthia Pearson, executive director of the National Women’s Health Network criticized the follow-up rate at Mentor.   “I want to urge you to advise the agency that this (the low follow-up rate at Mentor) is unacceptable and that their approval is revoked 12 months from today unless the company does a better job,” Pearson told the panel.   Jean Silver-Isenstadt, executive director of the National Physicians Alliance, said the FDA needed to show its commitment to enforcing post-approval studies.   “We believe that this agency has to walk the walk,” she told Reuters. “Its mission is to protect patients, and when it sets criteria for approval, that should be real.   “When the agency begins to look more like window-dressing (for companies), that will shake the faith of physicians and patients.”   The advisory panel will make its final recommendations on post-approval studies on Wednesday.

104,JNJ,Pain for NuPathe stock as migraine patch rejected,"BANGALORE (Reuters) - NuPathe Inc’s PATH.O experimental migraine patch — Zelrix — was rejected by U.S. health regulators on Tuesday, sending its shares down to a life-low and pushing back the launch of its key product by at least 6 months.  The Conshohocken, Pennsylvania-based company’s stock tumbled 49 percent to $1.89 on Tuesday morning making it the biggest loser on Nasdaq, as investors worried about the treatment’s future and costs associated with additional trials.  The company, which was planning to launch the patch in the first half of 2012, said the U.S. Food & Drug Administration raised questions on the patch’s chemistry, manufacturing and safety in a complete response letter.  “My estimate is that this will delay the approval for Zelrix probably by 6 months,” Wedbush Securities analyst Liana Moussatos told Reuters.  NuPathe, which focuses on diseases of the central nervous system, including schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease, said it may have to conduct additional early-stage and/or non-clinical studies to answer some of the questions raised by the FDA.  “It maybe a pre-clinical or a toxicology study that the FDA wants done or has a question about, but not a long study that would require lots of patients to fulfill a safety database,” analyst Moussatos said.  She added that the FDA’s acknowledgement of the patch’s efficacy suggests the company would not have to conduct a late-stage trial.  Zelrix is a single-use patch that quickly delivers GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK.L) sumatriptan, which is also available generically, through the patient’s skin using an electric current.  In 2008, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) recalled its pain patch Ionsys, which used the same technology as Zelrix, from European markets, after a potential risk of drug overdose.  Moussatos said NuPathe’s patch is being designed to target a niche population that suffers from migraine side effects of nausea and vomiting and have a hard time swallowing a pill.  “I don’t see it taking a huge market share because it is a patch, but all the doctors that I talked to at the American Headache Society meeting said about 5 percent of their patients like patches and prefer them,” Moussatos said, estimating peak sales of $300 million.  GlaxoSmithKline’s Imitrex, Merck’s (MRK.N) Maxalt, AstraZeneca’s (AZN.L) Zomig and Pfizer’s (PFE.N) Relpax are among leading medicines currently on the market for migraine.  NuPathe said it has, or shortly will have, sufficient data to address the issues. It had submitted a new drug application for Zelrix in October 2010.  The company, which has a market cap of $53.64 million, will also request a meeting with the FDA to discuss the letter and its approach to resolve the issues.  Analyst Moussatos said the company is likely to meet the FDA in 30-45 days.  Migraine is a neurological disorder that affects about 30 million adults in the United States, NuPathe said.

105,JNJ,Heart valves and toasters: call for new EU rules," * Cardiologists seek overhaul of EU devices system   * Light-touch framework raises safety concerns   * Gap between European and U.S. medtech regulation    By Ben Hirschler	   PARIS, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Pacemakers and electric toasters have little in common, yet in Europe the same regulatory framework covers both and a growing number of doctors think the system is no longer up to the job.	   The issue has come to the fore at this year’s annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), which is calling for an overhaul of Europe’s “CE mark” scheme as far as it affects evaluating and approving new medical technology.	   The push for change in Europe highlights a heated debate on both sides of the Atlantic over how to encourage innovation in often life-saving devices while at the same time controlling risks.	   In the United States, disgruntled medical technology firms look enviously at the relaxed regulatory regime in Europe and some Republicans have used the European example to scold the Food and Drug Administration over its slower approval process.	   High-tech devices — from coronary stents and artificial heart valves to replacement hips and knees — can certainly get a green light faster in Europe than in the United States.	   But that is not always a good thing, according to Dr Alan Fraser, a cardiologist at Cardiff University, who has led a review of the European Union regulations for the ESC.	   “It tends to be that clinical trials are done after approval in Europe but before approval in the United States,” he said in an interview.	   “Where there have been isolated instances of devices that were associated with complications, those have disproportionately occurred in countries that have earlier approval — and that tends to be Europe.”	   Over the years there have been problems with a range of implanted devices, in heart medicine and other areas. 	   These have not been exclusively in Europe, as shown by last year’s massive worldwide recall of artificial hips by Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy unit. 	   Under a package of measures adopted more than 20 years ago, manufacturers selling devices in Europe must satisfy the “essential requirements” of safety and performance, but they do not necessarily need to show that a device benefits patients.	   Europe also has no centralised process for approving medical devices, unlike the United States, so manufacturers are free to seek approval from any EU country. The suspicion is that this leads to “forum shopping”, with companies choosing agencies offering the least burdensome and fastest reviews.	   The ESC would instead like to see a single coordinated European system, with more pre-market testing and post-marketing surveillance, as part of a move to close the gap between systems in different parts of the world.	   The hope among doctors is that new proposals set to go before EU ministers in 2012 will address these issues.	   “At least we want to agree on similar processes,” said the ESC’s president, Dr Michel Komajda of Pitie Salpetriere Hospital in Paris. “I don’t know if it will end up with really global standards but I think it is useful to have transatlantic discussions.”	   Similar issues are occupying his opposite number at the American College of Cardiology, Dr David Holmes of the Mayo Clinic, following calls for a shake-up to the 510(k) system under which most U.S. devices are approved. 	   Holmes said a middle way needed to be found between the flood of new devices that often hit the market in Europe and the much lower number seen in the United States.	   Nearly 80 coronary stents have been approved in Europe, for example, against only a handful in the United States.	   “There must be some happy medium. Some of the devices that have had CE approval were then shown to be neither any better and they could have been worse. That was too lax. On the other hand, there are devices that are just being approved in the United States that aren’t ever going to be used in Europe because they are too old,” Holmes said.	   Other than Johnson & Johnson, major makers of medical devices include Medtronic , Boston Scientific and Abbott Laboratories .

106,JNJ,Astellas clot drug raises bleeding in heart study," * Darexaban causes two- to four-fold more bleeding   * Phase II study raises doubts about use in ACS    By Ben Hirschler	   PARIS, Aug 30 (Reuters) - An experimental anti-clotting drug from Japan’s Astellas increased bleeding two- to four-fold in a mid-stage clinical study of heart patients, raising questions about its role in treating those with acute coronary problems.	   The new oral anticoagulant, known as darexaban or YM150, also showed no sign of reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes, although researchers said the 1,279-patient Phase II study was too small to evaluate efficacy with any certainty.	   While the results are disappointing, the outcome does not necessarily mean darexaban has no future, Dr Gabriel Steg of the Hospital Bichat in Paris, who led the research, said on Tuesday.	   The Astellas medicine belongs to the same so-called Factor Xa inhibitor drug class as Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer’s Eliquis, which on Sunday produced impressive results in another group of patients — those at risk of stroke because they have dangerously irregular heart rhythms.	   Before succeeding in this atrial fibrillation (AF) population, Eliquis had also failed in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to excessive bleeding.	   Patients with ACS, which typically involves chest pain and risk of heart attack due to blocked arteries, are given antiplatelet bloodthinners to reduce their risk danger of clots. But doctors are interested to find out if the new generation of oral anticoagulants might also help.	   The latest study raises fresh doubts about the strategy.	   “I think we have a series of mixed signals. It is probably a little too soon to forgo the idea of adding anticoagulants to anti-platelet therapy,” Steg told reporters at the European Society of Cardiology annual meeting.	   Various doses of darexaban were tested on top of dual antiplatelet therapy in the Phase II trial and bleeding increased as dosing increased.	   Dr David Holmes of the Mayo Clinic, who is also president of the American College of Cardiology and was not involved in the research, said it was still worth investigating the use of anticoagulants in ACS, although a low dose of darexaban would be needed in any future tests.	   Darexaban is also being studied for stroke prevention in AF patients and it has already produced good results in preventing the risk of blood clots after orthopaedic surgery.	   Still, it is a late entrant into an increasingly crowded marketplace, with rivals including Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa, Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson & Johnson’s  Xarelto, and Bristol and Pfizer’s Eliquis — as well as a late pipeline product call edoxaban from Daiichi-Sankyo .	   Last February, Astellas withdrew its Japanese filing for darexaban for use after surgery, following a request from regulators for additional clinical studies. The company has said it will decide on future plans for the drug based on the outcome of discussions with potential global partners.

107,JNJ,FDA eyes registry for breast implants problems,"GAITHERSBURG, Maryland (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators said they would consider setting up a registry that tracks safety problems with breast implants, after too many patients dropped out of company-funded studies.  But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration emphasized on Wednesday that silicone implants were safe and would stay on the market, despite calls for their removal by consumer groups.  Expert advisers who held a two-day meeting to discuss post-approval safety studies for silicone implants urged the FDA to establish a registry.  “We believe it’s a good idea to have a conversation about a breast implant registry. ... (But) we believe implants are safe and effective and should remain on the market,” Dr William Maisel, deputy director of the FDA’s devices division, told reporters after the meeting.  In 2006 the FDA approved silicone gel-filled breast implants sold by Allergan and Johnson & Johnson’s Mentor unit on condition both companies follow 40,000 women for 10 years to look at safety issues, as well as extend smaller pre-approval studies.  So far, Allergan has collected preliminary two-year data for 60 percent of participants, while Mentor has collected three-year data for only 21 percent — well below the 65 percent the FDA said would be acceptable.  “It’s very inefficient to enroll 40,000 patients, and only get data on 400 on them (for rare symptoms). So having registries is a much more high-value approach,” said Jason Connor, a biostatistician on the advisory panel.  There were almost 400,000 breast enlargement or reconstruction procedures in the United States in 2010, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. That includes silicone and saline implants.  In June, the FDA said the risks of breast implants are well understood, after looking at the companies’ results as well as reports of negative events and scientific literature. It said women who get silicone implants are likely to need additional surgery within 10 years.  The agency had banned silicone implants for most U.S. women in 1992 after some said the devices leaked and made them chronically ill.  The companies and FDA advisers said patients and their doctors may not have enough incentives to stay in the company-funded studies, especially if they have to fill out a 27-page questionnaire every year, or do expensive medical procedures such as MRIs that test if their implant has ruptured.  A registry, which would track any patient who has had a breast implant, can provide broader data, making it easier to identify any complications, such as rupturing of the device.  Panel members said women should be encouraged to enroll in the registry by linking participation to the warranty on their devices, or to their surgeons’ certification.  Maisel also said it was important to involve different groups, including advocacy groups and physicians, to make sure patients understand the benefits of sharing information about their implants.  “What we’ve heard over the last two days is that it takes a whole community,” Maisel said. “You can have the most well-meaning company, but if the patients don’t want to participate in the study, that’s out of their control.”  However, some groups said the agency was letting manufacturers, especially Mentor, off the hook.  “You can’t ignore the fact that Allergan has three times more patients participating than Mentor. You can’t not hold Mentor responsible for that,” said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women & Families.

110,JNJ,Reheated bid talks boosts Smith & Nephew's shares," LONDON, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Britain’s Smith & Nephew  resumed its familiar role as a potential takeover candidate on Wednesday but analysts said market conditions and regulatory hurdles made an imminent move on the artificial hip and knee maker unlikely.	   Shares in Smith & Nephew had lost 13 percent of their value since Jan. 1 but on Wednesday rose 4.9 percent on top of a 3.9 percent gain on Tuesday as press reports resurrected talk of bid interest from Stryker , Johnson & Johnson and Biomet.	   Morningstar analyst Julie Stralow said the rumours went back many years. “I chalk them up to rumours at this point,” she said.	   The speculation endures because analysts and Smith & Nephew itself have said the orthopaedics market will consolidate as hospitals seek economies from dealing with fewer suppliers.	   The British company, worth about $9 billion, trails Zimmer  , Johnson & Johnson and Stryker in terms of market share, occupying a second tier with Bioment.	   Johnson & Johnson approached Smith & Nephew late last year, according to people familiar with the matter, before it turned its attention to Switzerland’s Synthes.	   Analysts at MF Global said an acquisition of S&N by J&J, or Stryker for that matter, would not be cleared by U.S. antitrust authorities because of their combined shares of hip and knee implants.	   Morningstar’s Stralow said as well as attracting hard scrutiny from antitrust regulators, buying S&N would be a large deal for Stryker. 	   “Stryker has been diversifying, doing deals outside the orthopaedics space,” she said. 	   “The largest deal Stryker has done recently was its purchase of Boston Scientific’s neurovascular business for $1.5 billion. Buying Smith & Nephew would be an uncharacteristically large deal for Stryker.”	   U.S rival Bioment, which is owned by a consortium of private-equity firms, was also named as a possible bidder in the press reports.	   Bank of America Merrill Lynch tried to put together a meeting of chief executives from the two companies in January but the talks were cancelled after the news of a possible link-up leaked out, said one source earlier in the year.	   MF Global said on Wednesday that a Biomet deal would not encounter the same level of antitrust issues, but funding would be hard to come by.	   “Given the two companies almost reached agreement on a merger in 2006, and hip and knee market shares were so “sticky” anti-trust authorities would probably still be comfortable with A Biomet/Smith & Nephew combination,” they said.	   “(But) we believe that financing would prevent such a deal from taking place. 	   “Given that Biomet is already so highly geared we question whether banks would extend the necessary loans to the private equity consortium (which owns Biomet) to purchase Smith & Nephew.” 	   One sector banker following the situation said the most serious bidder would be Biomet’s private-equity owners, but he did not expect a deal any time soon.	   “It could be difficult for them to put a 750-800 pence bid together in current tight funding market,” he said.	   “Shareholders would not support a deal coming under this price tag.”	   Smith & Nephew said it did not comment on market speculation.

The agency had banned silicone implants for most U.S. women in 1992 after some said the devices leaked and made them chronically ill.  During the Tuesday meeting, patients complained of side effects such as rupturing or hardening of the device, and said the companies’ long-term studies could be biased against patients who have problems.  In addressing low response rates, company representatives said the studies had perhaps “over-reached” by trying to keep track of so many patients, and by requiring each to fill out a 27-page questionnaire each year.  Mentor also said it may have had particularly low response rates because the company made patients participate in the study as a condition of getting an implant, but later changed it to voluntary participation.  “In retrospect, it’s perhaps not surprising that if a patient or surgeon enrolls because they are required to, and then a patient is told because of voluntary consent they’re not ... that might contribute to low follow-up rates,” said Dr. John Canady, medical director at Mentor, when asked if the company’s study had any design flaws.  “That’s something we would go back to change, but obviously can’t in this study.”  Jean Silver-Isenstadt, executive director of the National Physicians Alliance, said the FDA needed to show its commitment to enforcing post-approval studies.  “We believe that this agency has to walk the walk,” she told Reuters. “Its mission is to protect patients, and when it sets criteria for approval, that should be real.  “When the agency begins to look more like window-dressing (for companies), that will shake the faith of physicians and patients.”  The advisory panel will make its final recommendations on post-approval studies on Wednesday.

113,JNJ,"Bayer, J&J; clot drug seen winning U.S. panel nod","WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - An experimental stroke preventer from Bayer and Johnson & Johnson is likely to win a recommendation from U.S. health advisers next week, but not without concern over risks seen when patients come off the drug.  A key issue for the Food and Drug Administration advisers may be the so-called rebound effect of the medicine Xarelto. When patients stopped taking it and resumed older drug warfarin, higher risk of stroke was seen in trials.  “We think the FDA advisory panel will be concerned that there’s a ‘rebound’ effect with discontinuing Xarelto,” Wells Fargo analysts said in a research note on Thursday. “However, our consultants do not believe this will be a deal breaker.”  Xarelto’s shortcomings may also relegate it to second place in the marketplace behind a rival treatment being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc, in an anti-clotting market that could top $10 billion a year, analysts say.  The advisory panel is set to consider the data on Xarelto next Thursday, after the FDA releases its initial findings on the drug on Tuesday.  “Key opinion leaders expect a panel recommendation for Xarelto, but not without controversy,” analysts at Leerink Swann wrote in a note on Thursday.  The FDA usually follows the advice of its advisory panels, and Xarelto could be approved by November if the pill wins support at the meeting.  Xarelto is one of several promising entrants angling to replace risky clot preventer warfarin for people with dangerously irregular heart rhythms, called atrial fibrillation (AF).  AF patients’ irregular heartbeats can cause blood to pool, increasing their risk of blood clots and strokes. But many are unwilling to take warfarin, which requires regular blood tests, or are unable to tolerate the old medicine.  Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa is already approved in stroke prevention, while Eliquis, from Bristol-Myers and Pfizer, has so far shown the best clinical data, especially for reducing the risk of major bleeding.  Jeff Jonas, an analyst with Gabelli & Co, predicted the advisory panel will recommend Xarelto because of its effectiveness and acceptable bleeding risk, and its advantages over warfarin.  “Xarelto will be overshadowed by apixaban (Eliquis), but it is going to be a decent drug and could generate $1 billion to $2 billion in annual sales, with the marketing muscle of J&J and Bayer,” he said. Bristol and Pfizer plan to submit Eliquis for U.S. approval later this year for preventing stroke.  Another issue is some inconsistent data. A clinical trial last November showed Xarelto, known generically as rivaroxaban, was 21 percent better at preventing stroke in patients with AF compared with warfarin.  But when all those who entered the trial were evaluated, no superiority was established for Xarelto, a fact that is likely to come up in panel discussions.  “A superiority claim over warfarin ... is unlikely in our view and is not widely anticipated,” said Barbara Ryan, analyst at Deutsche Bank, in a research note on Friday.  Panelists may also focus on the fact that warfarin was not used as effectively as it might have been in the study, making it more difficult to compare it with Xarelto.  Xarelto’s advantage over rivals may come in its dosing, since it needs to be taken only once a day as opposed to twice for Eliquis and Pradaxa, a key factor for elderly patients taking multiple medications.  Gabelli & Co’s Jonas said Eliquis is likely to capture 50 percent or more of the warfarin-replacement market, with Xarelto in second place comfortably ahead of Pradaxa.  “Pradaxa is being dismissed; it will be relatively small,” he predicted.  Even though Pradaxa was the first to market, having been approved by U.S. regulators last year, it causes gastrointestinal side effects in a significant percentage of patients and has special storage requirements.  Pradaxa works by directly blocking a protein called thrombin that plays a key role in the clotting process, while Eliquis and Xarelto block the Factor Xa protein.  The three medicines — and a fourth from Daiichi-Sankyo called edoxaban that is due to report pivotal results in 2012 — will greatly expand the number of patients with AF taking anticoagulants.

116,JNJ,Bayer/J&J; stroke drug not ready for approval-US FDA,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. drug regulators said an experimental stroke preventer from Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) is not ready for approval and raised questions about its effectiveness, sending Bayer shares down more than 7 percent.  “There is a lack of substantial evidence that rivaroxaban will have its desired effect when used as recommended in labeling,” Food and Drug Administration staff in documents released on Tuesday.  The FDA staff recommended that the agency issue a so-called complete response letter for the drug, also known by its proposed trade name Xarelto, which means it cannot be approved without more data from the companies.  Even if approved, the agency staff said the drug should be used as a third option behind other treatments, unless the companies submit more data on effectiveness and safety.  “The wording is quite critical,” said Karl-Heinz Scheunemann, an analyst with LBBW. “Should the committee agree with the recommendation - which is not always the case - it’s safe to assume that there will be a delay in the market approval.”  The FDA will make its final decision after taking into account the views of an advisory panel, which considers Xarelto on Thursday.  Xarelto is one of several promising entrants angling to replace risky clot preventer warfarin for people with dangerously irregular heart rhythms, called atrial fibrillation (AF).  AF patients’ irregular heartbeats can cause blood to pool, increasing their risk of blood clots and strokes. But many are unwilling to take warfarin, which requires regular blood tests, or are unable to tolerate the decades-old medicine.  Bayer shares fell as much as 13 percent before paring losses. J&J shares were mostly flat on a down day for U.S. markets. Bayer, a smaller company than Johnson & Johnson, is more reliant on Xarelto.  The drug is approved in the United States and Europe for anti-clotting in patients after knee and hip surgery, a much smaller market than stroke prevention for AF patients.  Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss said Xarelto’s prospects have now significantly dimmed. Even if approved, Purkiss said, the drug will now likely only be used if patients do not benefit from warfarin and Pradaxa, a newly approved stroke medicine from privately held Boehringer Ingelheim.  The FDA review appeared to be good news for a rival treatment called Eliquis being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), in an anti-clotting market that could top $10 billion a year.  Pfizer shares were up 0.7 percent, while Bristol-Myers was up 0.4 percent, with both stocks were outperforming the broader U.S. market and the Arca Pharmaceuticals Index .DRG.  Eliquis, also called apixaban, showed superiority over warfarin in effectiveness, safety and saving lives in a clinical trial presented last month at a scientific meeting in Paris, affirming its place as the potential leader of the pack.  “The prospects for apixaban and Pradaxa just got better,” Purkiss said after the Xarelto review.  THIRD-LINE STATUS?  FDA reviewers questioned whether Xarelto was as effective as warfarin, saying that in a trial comparing the two, warfarin was not given in the proper dosing.  They said for conditions such as stroke, which can cause irreversible harm, new drugs must be shown to be at least as effective as older treatments.  They also focused on risks for patients when they come off the drug. When patients stopped taking Xarelto and resumed warfarin at the end of the main clinical trial, higher risk of stroke was seen, a so-called “rebound” effect.  However, bleeding risk was the only significant issue with Xarelto on its own, the FDA staff said.  They asked the companies to conduct further trials to show Xarelto was as safe and effective as warfarin, or as compared to Pradaxa.  “It seems advisable to make rivaroxaban a third-line agent, behind both warfarin and dabigatran (Pradaxa),” FDA staff said in the documents, until the companies submit more data on Xarelto.  Johnson & Johnson said the FDA staff documents did not represent the agency’s final recommendation.  “We’re confident in the effectiveness of rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in patients with AF,” said Ernie Knewitz, a spokesman for J&J. The two companies co-developed the drug, and J&J has marketing rights in the United States.  Analysts from Sanford Bernstein forecast Xarelto sales of $948 million for J&J in 2015, and 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) for Bayer, which has much greater sales outside the United States.  They said the market overreacted in its initial sharp drop, especially as European regulators often reach different conclusions than the FDA.  “We accept ... that the reviewers in this case are unusually directive, recommending a complete response rather than simply raising questions,” Bernstein analysts said in a note.  “(But) all is not lost for Xarelto in the advisory committee on Thursday,” the analysts said. “Panels do not always follow the recommendations of the FDA reviewers.”  ",9062011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fda-xarelto/bayer-jj-stroke-drug-not-ready-for-approval-us-fda-idUSTRE78550220110906

120,JNJ,Will bargain Bayer attract a buyer after setback?,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - One day after a damning appraisal by U.S. regulators of Bayer’s (BAYGn.DE) Xarelto pill, analysts took stock of what the group could be worth without its most important pipeline drug, and some now see it as a takeover target.  The prevailing view is that the share rout that followed the Food and Drug Administration’s preliminary verdict on Tuesday made Bayer quite a bargain, even in the worst case that Xarelto wins no or only a small inroad in the world’s largest drug market.  One analyst even suggests that industry rivals, Sanofi (SASY.PA) in particular, stand to gain from buying Bayer outright.  U.S. drug regulators said Bayer and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) experimental stroke preventer Xarelto, an anti blood-clotting agent, was not ready for approval and questions were raised about its effectiveness, sending Bayer shares down more than 7 percent.  Xarelto is Bayer’s most important pipeline drug by far, and the company eyes more than 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in annual sales from it.  On Wednesday, the shares had recouped 2 percent, hitting 38.49 euros by 9:37 a.m. EDT.  “On average the European Pharma companies would stand to increase their (2015 estimated earnings per share) by 50 percent even in the scenario of zero contribution from Xarelto globally,” J.P. Morgan analysts Alexandra Hauber and Richard Vosser said in a note issued on Wednesday.  “We believe the best strategic fit is with Sanofi, Novartis NOVN.VX and AstraZeneca (AZN.L),” they said, basing their analysis on a hypothetical 20 percent takeover premium over Tuesday’s close.  Bayer would be a “very strong fit” across Sanofi’s oncology, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, animal health and consumer health businesses, they added.  For its part, Sanofi on Tuesday again ruled out major transactions.  Apart from the deal size — Bayer has a market value of more than 30 billion euros even after the slump — Bayer’s chemicals-to-drugs hybrid structure would make a takeover a highly complex transaction.  A healthcare buyer seeking to preserve its “pure play” bonus would have to divest Bayer’s pesticides and chemicals business, which according to J.P.Morgan could be a 20-25 billion euro deal.  Still, UniCredit analysts echoed J.P. Morgan in saying that Bayer was now a “compelling acquisition target” with a fair value of 76.08 euros per share, more than double Tuesday’s close.  Both Bayer’s alpharadin, a drug against bone metastases, and eye drug Eylea, previously known as VEGF Trap-Eye, make for an attractive pipeline without Xarelto, several brokerages said.  Of the 36 Bayer analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters StarMine, 23, or more than 60 percent, rate the stock “buy” or the equivalent of “strong buy.” Their average price target is 61.07 euros per share.  The FDA’s recommendation, however, took most analysts by surprise.  “This view is significantly different from the consensus of cardiologists presenting at the European Society of Cardiology conference last week,” said Craig Maxwell at UniCredit.  Many of his peers stressed that the FDA advisory committee of independent experts due to vote late on Thursday could still take a different view from the FDA’s initial statement, but peak sales estimates were slashed or put in doubt across the board.  Equinet analyst Martin Possienke cut his estimate of maximum annual sales from Xarelto to 500 million from 3 billion euros. Barclays Capital’s Mark Purcell said he was bracing for “commercial failures” of the Xarelto franchise.  Even if approved, Xarelto’s use in the United States might be limited to those patients for whom the established stroke prevention drug warfarin and Boehringer Ingelheim’s new Pradaxa pill is not advisable.  Rival treatment Eliquis, under development by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Pfizer (PFE.N), is currently viewed as the drug with potentially the best benefit-risk profile in a stroke prevention market that could top $10 billion a year.

Morgan analysts Alexandra Hauber and Richard Vosser said in a note issued on Wednesday.	   “We believe the best strategic fit is with Sanofi, Novartis  and AstraZeneca ,” they said, basing their analysis on a hypothetical 20 percent takeover premium over Tuesday’s close.	   Bayer would be a “very strong fit” across Sanofi’s oncology, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, animal health and consumer health businesses, they added.	   For its part, Sanofi on Tuesday again ruled out major transactions. 	   Apart from the deal size — Bayer has a market value of more than 30 billion euros even after the slump — Bayer’s chemicals-to-drugs hybrid structure would make a takeover a highly complex transaction.	   A healthcare buyer seeking to preserve its “pure play” bonus would have to divest Bayer’s pesticides and chemicals business, which according to J.P.Morgan could be a 20-25 billion euro deal.	   Still, UniCredit analysts echoed J.P. Morgan in saying that Bayer was now a “compelling acquisition target” with a fair value of 76.08 euros per share, more than double Tuesday’s close.	   Both Bayer’s alpharadin, a drug against bone metastases, and eye drug Eylea, previously known as VEGF Trap-Eye, make for an attractive pipeline without Xarelto, several brokerages said.   	   Of the 36 Bayer analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters StarMine, 23, or more than 60 percent, rate the stock “buy” or the equivalent of “strong buy”. Their average price target is 61.07 euros per share.	   The FDA’s recommendation, however, took most analysts by surprise.	   “This view is significantly different from the consensus of cardiologists presenting at the European Society of Cardiology conference last week,” said Craig Maxwell at UniCredit.	   Many of his peers stressed that the FDA advisory committee of independent experts due to vote late on Thursday could still take a different view from the FDA’s initial statement, but peak sales estimates were slashed or put in doubt across the board.	   Equinet analyst Martin Possienke cut his estimate of maximum annual sales from Xarelto to 500 million from 3 billion euros. Barclays Capital’s Mark Purcell said he was bracing for “commercial failures” of the Xarelto franchise.	   Even if approved, Xarelto’s use in the United States might be limited to those patients for whom the established stroke prevention drug warfarin and Boehringer Ingelheim’s new Pradaxa pill is not advisable.	   Rival treatment Eliquis, under development by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer , is currently viewed as the drug with potentially the best benefit-risk profile in a stroke prevention market that could top $10 billion a year.

124,JNJ,UPDATE 2-US FDA panel gives nod to Bayer/J&J; anti-clot drug," * Panelists split on whether Xarelto as good as warfarin   * Call for more data on how to transition off of Xarelto   * Xarelto market share could fall to 10 pct-Morningstar   * FDA decision expected by Nov. 4  (Adds company and analyst comments, sales)   By Anna Yukhananov   COLLEGE PARK, Md., Sept 8 (Reuters) - A new stroke preventer from Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) moved one step closer to U.S. approval, but questions remained about restrictions on labeling and the need for more studies.   A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted 9-2 on Thursday to recommend approval of the once-a-day anti-clotting pill, called Xarelto.   Xarelto is one of several promising entrants angling to replace warfarin for people with dangerously irregular heart rhythms, called atrial fibrillation (AF).   Warfarin is a problematic decades-old clot preventer originally developed as rat poison.   “I’ve seen the problems many patients face with warfarin,” said Dr. Philip Sager, a panel member and executive committee member of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium in San Francisco. “I think there’s a tremendous unmet medical need for new therapies.”   Analysts estimate the stroke-fighting market could top $10 billion annually. Xarelto may lose out on market share if the FDA asks the company to conduct further trials, delaying approval, analysts said.   AF patients’ irregular heartbeats can cause blood to pool, increasing their risk of blood clots and strokes. But many are unwilling to take warfarin, which requires regular blood tests, or are unable to tolerate it.   Panelists were divided on whether Xarelto, with the clinical name rivaroxaban, was as effective as warfarin.   In clinical trials that compared Xarelto to warfarin, panelists and the FDA said the older drug was not always given in the proper dosing, making it more difficult to determine if Xarelto was just as good.   “I’ve heard nothing that convinces me that rivaroxaban should be first-line treatment for many patients,” said Allan Coukell, the patient representative on the panel and director for medical safety at Pew Health Group, adding that Xarelto’s label should reflect that.   Earlier this week, FDA reviewers said for conditions such as stroke, which can cause irreversible harm, new drugs must be shown to be at least as effective as older treatments, and called for the agency to delay Xarelto’s approval. [ID:nN1E7850CD]   In Thursday’s meeting, panel members also focused on risks for patients when they come off the drug. Patients who stopped taking Xarelto and resumed warfarin at the end of the main clinical trial had a higher risk of stroke, a so-called “rebound” effect.   “Additional data probably should be obtained regarding how to transition (off of Xarelto) prior to approval,” said Dr. Michael Lincoff, chair of the panel and professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.   The FDA is set to make the final decision on Xarelto by Nov. 4, Johnson & Johnson said.   “Given the relatively risk-adverse nature of the FDA, even with this panel’s recommendation of Xarelto, the agency may want a number of additional studies” before granting approval, said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.   “So there could be a one-to-two-year delay,” he predicted, saying that would greatly hurt the drug’s ultimate sales potential.   He said the FDA might be willing to take its time because another effective blood clot preventer, Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa, was approved last year and is already available as an alternative to warfarin.   Conover said he had expected Xarelto to eventually capture 15 percent of the stroke-prevention market among AF patients, but he now expects its market share to be below 10 percent.   Dr Peter Dibattiste, global head of J&J’s cardiovascular and metabolic division, said the company will discuss with the FDA the need for additional studies. A study looking at how long Xarelto lasted in patients could be relatively quick, “probably months,” he told reporters.   A delay for Xarelto could give the edge to a rival treatment called Eliquis being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). If Eliquis is approved, Morningstar’s Conover predicted, it could have four times the sales of Xarelto.   Eliquis, also called apixaban, showed superiority over warfarin in effectiveness, safety and saving lives in a clinical trial presented last month at a scientific meeting in Paris, affirming its place as the potential leader of the pack. [ID:nL5E7JT0KV]   Xarelto is approved in the United States and Europe for anti-clotting in patients after knee and hip surgery, a much smaller market than stroke prevention for AF patients.   Earlier this week, analysts from Sanford Bernstein forecast Xarelto sales of $948 million for J&J in 2015, and 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) for Bayer, which has much greater sales outside the United States.   Bayer said it sees peak sales of Xarelto at more than 2 billion euro ($2.8 billion), “irrespective of the decision by the FDA in early November,” according to a statement.   Bayer, which co-developed the drug with J&J, sold exclusive U.S. marketing rights for Xarelto to J&J in 2005. As part of that agreement Bayer stands to receive royalty payments of up to 30 percent on U.S. sales.   Bayer said it expects approval of Xarelto in Europe in the third or fourth quarter of this year.

128,JNJ,REFILE-UPDATE 1-Dendreon faces uphill battle to win credibility," (Refiling to fix typographical error in 15th paragraph)   * Dendreon to outline restructuring plan on Thursday   * Faces tough battle to win investor confidence   * Shares down 5.5 percent in afternoon trading  (Adds investor and analyst comment, updates share price)   By Toni Clarke and Bill Berkrot   BOSTON/NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Dendreon Corp DNDN.O, which makes the high-priced prostate cancer vaccine Provenge, faces an uphill battle to win back investor confidence after abruptly withdrawing its sales forecast for the drug last month.   The company will discuss its future on a conference call with investors after the market closes on Thursday and lay out a restructuring plan that is expected to focus on cutting manufacturing costs and boosting profit margins.   Investors, who feel management has promised more than it has delivered, are more interested in action than words. Dendreon shares fell 5.5 percent ahead of the call, hurt in part by European approval on Wednesday of a rival prostate cancer drug, Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) Zytiga.   “It’s not good enough for management to just tell investors that they think that can do X, Y or Z,” said Eric Schmidt, an analyst at Cowen and Co. “If Dendreon wants to convince us they can improve their margins to levels more in line with the industry, they are going to have to make actual progress before many of us buy in.”   Gross profit margins in the pharmaceuticals industry range from 70 percent and 90 percent. Dendreon’s was roughly 42 percent in the last quarter.   Analysts expect the company to achieve most of its savings by shutting down a manufacturing facility or scaling back all three of its plants.   “We see little room for them to lower their other discretionary expenses,” said Geoff Porges, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein who initiated coverage of the company on Thursday with an “underperform” rating and $8 price target.   Dendreon management lost credibility with investors last month when it abandoned its 2011 sales forecast for Provenge on the heels of disappointing second-quarter results. The move cost the company two-thirds of its market value and sparked a flood of lawsuits.   “They’ve done such a bad job of being transparent that nobody knows what’s going on there,” said Brad Loncar, who spearheaded a move by individual shareholders to shake up the company’s board but has since sold most of his shares.   “They have to get expenses in line with revenue projections,” said Loncar, who believes Provenge is a very good drug that has not been properly promoted. “What would make me happy is to know exactly what the situation is and to see them have a tangible business plan.”   At issue is whether sales of Provenge have been held back by a fundamental lack of demand.   The company previously blamed slow sales growth on manufacturing constraints, which have since been resolved. More recently, it has blamed a steeper-than-expected learning curve by physicians and uncertainty over whether the drug would be reimbursed.   Joseph Pantginis, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners LLC, said it is not surprising that an altogether new type of drug like Provenge would take time to settle in the market. But he said management needs to prove it is creating demand for the product, which costs $93,000 for a course of treatment.   “They definitely have taken a hit from a credibility standpoint,” he said. “Companies that blind-side investors like this tend to be in the penalty box for a while.”  Sanford Bernstein’s Porges said the market may become too crowded and too complex for immunotherapies such as Provenge to achieve much “commercial traction.”   Before abandoning its long-held forecast, the company indicated 2011 Provenge sales would reach $350 million to $400 million, with about half of that coming in the fourth quarter.   Dendreon is expected to tell investors that one of the main goals for its sales force will be to educate physicians.   The company said last month that only about 25 percent of potential Provenge prescribers were aware of a June 30 decision by Medicare to cover the drug’s cost and the issuance of a so-called Q code that can help speed reimbursement. It said many doctors were waiting to prescribe Provenge until they were sure they would get paid.   Cowen’s Schmidt is skeptical that lack of physician education is the cause of Dendreon’s problems.   “I’m sure concern over reimbursement is a headwind but nothing any other company hasn’t experienced,” he said. “I think there is a real demand issue here.”   Dendreon shares were off 5.5 percent at $10.97 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. They are down from a year high of $43.96 in May.

129,JNJ,UPDATE 4-Pfizer arthritis drug shows mixed results," * Study shows oral Pfizer drug matches Humira efficacy   * Greater number of serious side effects with Pfizer drug   * Other studies confirm drug effective, well tolerated   * Deaths across trials deemed similar to standard drugs   * Pfizer shares slip 1 pct to $18.82  (Adds analyst comment, updates shares)   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot   NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - New data from a trial of Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) experimental pill to treat rheumatoid arthritis showed the medicine was as effective as Abbott Inc’s (ABT.N) blockbuster injectable Humira drug, but more patients taking it had serious side effects.   Summaries of several other late-stage trials to be presented at a major rheumatology meeting in November were released on Thursday and confirmed earlier findings that the Pfizer drug, tofacitinib, was effective and in general well tolerated.   The incidence of overall adverse events was similar for both drugs, but the proportion of patients who developed serious side effects, though small, was numerically higher in the tofacitinib groups.   Serious adverse effects are those deemed to have caused death, life-threatening events, need for hospitalization, or disability or permanent damage.   “Impressive efficacy was demonstrated, with focus now expected to be on safety leading into its regulatory review,” Jeffrey Holford, an analyst at Jefferies & Co, said in a research note. “While the market was expecting a similar efficacy between the higher dose of tofacitinib and Humira, the strong performance of the lower dose is impressive.”   Pfizer plans to seek approval of the medicine by the end of the year. The world’s biggest drugmaker is hoping tofacitinib, which some analysts believe can reach $2 billion in annual sales, and other new medicines can help offset plunging revenue from its Lipitor cholesterol fighter when it faces competition from cheaper generics as early as November.   Pfizer shares fell 1 percent to $18.82 early Thursday afternoon.   Data from a 12-month trial comparing tofacitinib and Humira, called ORAL Standard, involved 717 patients with moderate to severe disease who continued to take a widely used treatment called methotrexate.   One group of the patients took 5 milligram doses of the Pfizer drug twice a day, a second group took 10 mg doses twice a day, while a third group received Humira injections every two weeks. A fourth group of patients received a placebo.   The effectiveness of tofacitinib and Humira was numerically similar by all measures, according to the data, although the study was not designed to definitively assess superiority of one drug over the other.   Full details of the tofacitinib Phase III studies are expected to be unveiled in November at the annual American College of Rheumatology (ACR) scientific meeting in Chicago.   “Based on the totality of the tofacitinib RA clinical development program, Pfizer believes the risk/benefit profile supports regulatory submission for both the 5 and 10 mg dose,” Pfizer spokeswoman Victoria Davis said.   Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen predicted both doses of tofacitinib will be approved next year. But he said the drug should not greatly hamper sales of Humira its first few years on the market because doctors will prescribe tofacitinib mainly for patients who have failed to benefit from standard treatments.   “However, we expect tofacitinib to have a larger impact on Humira over time as Pfizer tries to move its use to an earlier stage” of treatment, Biegelsen said in a research note.   He said Humira is on track for sales this year of $7.8 billion, and that they will grow to $10.5 billion in 2015.   Data also became available for the first time on Thursday on the incidence of overall mortality and infections across numerous late-stage trials of the Pfizer medicine, and from longer-term follow-up of patients.   That pooled analysis, involving more than 6,200 patients, showed a mortality rate with tofacitinib of 0.572 deaths per 100 patient years in the Phase III trials, and 0.641 deaths per 100 patient years in the long-term evaluations.   In all, 12 patients died out of more than 3,000 who received tofacitinib in the Phase III trials, with deaths of another 20 patients seen among more than 3,200 who were followed in longer-term studies.   Pfizer said the death rates were consistent with those typically seen with standard treatments meant to slow the progress of arthritis symptoms.   Tofacitinib belongs to a new class of drugs known as JAK inhibitors that block a protein associated with inflammation.   It would compete against a lucrative family of biotech treatments that block a different protein called tumor necrosis factor. These treatments include Humira, one of the world’s biggest selling medicines, as well as Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) Remicade and Enbrel, which is sold by Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) and Pfizer.

130,JNJ,Dendreon faces uphill battle to regain credibility," * Dendreon to outline restructuring plan on Thursday   * Faces tough battle to win investor confidence   * Shares down 5.4 percent in morning trading   By Toni Clarke   BOSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Dendreon Corp DNDN.O, which makes the high-priced prostate cancer vaccine Provenge, faces an uphill battle to win investor confidence after withdrawing its sales forecast for the drug, and the company will discuss restructuring plans later Thursday.   Dendreon will address investors after the market closes and lay out a plan that is expected to focus on cutting manufacturing costs and boosting profit margins.   But it will be a tough slog, and investors are more interested in action than words. The company’s shares fell nearly 6 percent in morning trading on Nasdaq, hurt in part by European approval on Wednesday of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) new prostate cancer drug, Zytiga.   “It’s not good enough for management to just tell investors that they think that can do X, Y or Z,” said Eric Schmidt, an analyst at Cowen and Co. “If Dendreon wants to convince us they can improve their margins to levels more in line with the industry, they are going to have to make actual progress before many of us buy in.”   Gross profit margins in the pharmaceuticals industry range from 70 percent and 90 percent. Dendreon’s was roughly 42 percent in the last quarter.

The surprise move cost the company two-thirds of its market value and sparked a flood of lawsuits.   At issue now is whether sales of Provenge were held back due to a steeper-than-expected learning curve among physicians, as management believes, and concerns over reimbursement, or whether there is a fundamental lack of demand.   The company previously blamed the slow ramp-up in sales on manufacturing constraints that are no longer a problem.   Joseph Pantginis, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners LLC, said the slow sales are mainly due to a lack of understanding about a new product that has been on the market for just over a year. But he also said management needs to prove it is creating demand for the vaccine, which costs $93,000 for a course of treatment.   “They definitely have taken a hit from a credibility standpoint,” Pantginis said. “Companies that blind-side investors like this tend to be in the penalty box for a while.”   On Thursday, Sanford Bernstein initiated coverage of Dendreon with an “underperform” rating and a price target of $8.00, saying the market may become too crowded and too complex for immunotherapies such as Provenge to achieve much “commercial traction.”   “Our findings also suggest that as urologists and oncologists get more options, they will be more likely to consider combination therapy,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoff Porges said in a research report. “With multiple new hormonal and targeted treatments for prostate cancer on the horizon, we question whether Provenge can achieve even today’s much reduced consensus estimates.”   Before abandoning its long-held forecast, the company had indicated 2011 Provenge sales would reach $350 million to $400 million, with about half of the total coming in the fourth quarter as manufacturing capacity increased.

131,JNJ,PREVIEW-Lofty hopes confront Gilead's 4-drug HIV pill," * Key trial results expected this month   * May need to show superiority to rivals to boost stock   * Sales forecasts vary widely   By Deena Beasley   LOS ANGELES, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc’s (GILD.O) experimental four-drug HIV pill may need to do more than simply match the safety and effectiveness of existing therapies to meet its lofty sales expectations.   Results for the second pivotal clinical trial for the combination drug are expected this month. The pill is likely to meet the study’s goal of working as well as a combination of other medicines, analysts said, but it may need to show superiority to convince investors of its commercial potential and send Gilead shares higher.   The biotechnology company said in August that its first pivotal trial of the pill, known as the Quad, met the goal of showing that it worked as well as Atripla, Gilead’s current three-drug combination HIV pill.   But shares of the Foster City, California-based company fell as much as 3 percent after the news and the stock has dropped more than 10 percent over the past seven weeks.   “There were some investors who were hoping the trial would show superiority to Atripla,” said Needham & Co analyst Alan Carr.   The Quad is seen as Gilead’s most important pipeline product — all of the components are owned by the company, and the Quad would extend the life of the company’s lucrative HIV franchise.   As of early 2011, about 80 percent of U.S. HIV patients and 72 percent of European HIV patients were treated with a Gilead drug. Combination drugs are particularly important for HIV patients, who must juggle a huge amount of pills on a daily basis.   The Quad combines experimental integrase inhibitor elvitegravir and boosting agent cobicistat with Truvada, a pill consisting of Gilead’s older HIV drugs Emtriva and Viread.   Most of the company’s current drug sales — which totaled $7.4 billion last year — come from Atripla, a once-daily pill that combines Truvada with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY.N) Sustiva.   Gilead earns no profit from the Bristol drug, and all of the Atripla components lose patent protection in the next few years.   The second pivotal trial of the Quad is designed to show that it works as well as a combination of ritonavir-boosted Reyataz, a protease inhibitor sold by Bristol-Myers, and Truvada.   RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee puts the odds that the Quad will show superiority to the Reyataz regimen at 25 percent.   A lower-cost generic version of Atripla could be on the market in 2018, and Gilead will need a compelling case to convince doctors that the Quad will benefit patients more than existing HIV drugs.   If approved, the Quad would be the first single-tablet regimen for HIV to include an integrase inhibitor — a new class of drugs designed to block the ability of the human immunodeficiency virus to replicate.   The four-drug pill is also seen as potentially safer than Atripla, but Gilead said initial results from the first pivotal trial showed similar rates of adverse side effects and patient drop-out rates for both treatment groups.   Full safety data from the first trial will be presented at a medical conference in March, and Gilead plans to file for U.S. regulatory approval of the Quad in the first quarter of 2012.   U.S. regulators last month approved Gilead’s Complera, a  three-drug combination of Emtriva, Viread and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) Edurant. Under its deal with J&J, Gilead will keep up to 30 percent of what it makes off the Edurant component.   Analysts expect Gilead’s Complera sales to reach $916 million by 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. Sales of the Quad are forecast as high as $1.53 billion by 2015, but estimates vary widely.   “While Gilead remains the dominant market leader in HIV ... we believe the overall market trends are slowing and that trends toward earlier treatment have been close to fully realized,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Jim Birchenough said in a research note this week.   He forecasts 2015 Quad sales of just $367.3 million.   Gilead licensed elvitegravir from Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) in March 2005. The U.S. company has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the drug everywhere except Japan.   Currently, the only integrase inhibitor approved by regulators is Merck & Co Inc’s (MRK.N) Isentress, or raltegravir, but it must be taken twice a day.   ViiV Healthcare, a joint venture between GlaxoSmithkline Plc (GSK.L) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), is testing a combination of experimental integrase inhibitor dolutegravir and Epzicom, which consists of HIV drugs Ziagen and Epivir.   Yee at RBC Capital Markets said the Glaxo drug could be competition for the Quad, but noted that dolutegravir will not be co-formulated with Truvada.   He also said Epzicom use is associated with higher cardiovascular risks.

132,JNJ,Bayer gains as U.S. hopes revive for stroke drug,"FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - Bayer (BAYGn.DE) shares rose 2.5 percent on Friday after its stroke-prevention drug Xarelto was recommended by a U.S. panel, moving it a step closer to approval in the world’s biggest market.  But analysts said the drug, being developed with Johnson & Johnson (J&J) (JNJ.N), was only likely to carry a claim of non-inferiority, rather than superiority, over the established product warfarin and there may be a need for further studies.  “(The vote) should aid recovery in the stock although investors should be aware that Xarelto could still be delayed in the United States for stroke prevention,” JP Morgan analysts said in a note.  Xarelto’s place in the global stroke-fighting market, which could top $10 billion annually, had looked in serious jeopardy just three days ago.  On Tuesday, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewers called for the agency to delay approval in an initial assessment, sending Bayer shares on a one-day slump of 7.5 percent.  They recovered on Friday to be up 2.2 percent at 1114 GMT.  Now, with the backing of the advisory panel, the medicine seems likely to get to the U.S. market, though it could face delays and may well end up with labeling that puts it at a disadvantage to rivals.  WestLB analyst Norbert Barth said Xarelto’s commercial potential appeared limited, even if it was approved in the U.S. by the target date of early November.  Other analysts were not convinced approval would come so quickly.  Jeffrey Holford of Jefferies said it seemed likely the FDA would require a further small clinical study to assess risks for patients when they come off the drug, delaying its launch by around 12 months.  A delay for Xarelto could give a further edge to a rival treatment, Eliquis, being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), which is considered to have the strongest profile among the new rivals to warfarin.  Another blood clot preventer, Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa, was approved last year and is already available in the U.S. as an alternative to decades-old warfarin.  All three drugs are designed for patients with atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat mainly affecting the elderly that can cause blood to pool, increasing their risk of blood clots and strokes.  Tim Race of Deutsche Bank said it seemed likely Xarelto’s label would disadvantage the drug relative to Pradaxa and Eliquis, denting commercial expectations.  That could cut Deutsche’s 2015 U.S. Xarelto sales forecasts to 300-400 million euros from a current assumption of 900 million, he added.  Bayer said in a statement it continued to see worldwide peak sales of Xarelto at more than 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion), “irrespective of the decision by the FDA in early November.”  The German chemicals-and-drugs group sold exclusive U.S. rights for Xarelto to J&J in 2005. As part of that pact, Bayer stands to receive royalty payments of up to 30 percent on U.S. sales, while retaining exclusive rights outside the U.S.  In Europe, Bayer expects approval of Xarelto in the third or fourth quarter of this year.

135,JNJ,CORRECTED-US FDA panel gives nod to Bayer/J&J; anti-clot drug," (Corrects 10th paragraph to show Coukell is consumer representative, not patient representative)   * Panelists split on whether Xarelto as good as warfarin   * Call for more data on how to transition off of Xarelto   * Xarelto market share could fall to 10 pct-Morningstar   * FDA decision expected by Nov. 4  (Adds company and analyst comments, sales)   By Anna Yukhananov   COLLEGE PARK, Md., Sept 8 (Reuters) - A new stroke preventer from Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) moved one step closer to U.S. approval, but questions remained about restrictions on labeling and the need for more studies.   A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel voted 9-2 on Thursday to recommend approval of the once-a-day anti-clotting pill, called Xarelto.   Xarelto is one of several promising entrants angling to replace warfarin for people with dangerously irregular heart rhythms, called atrial fibrillation (AF).   Warfarin is a problematic decades-old clot preventer originally developed as rat poison.   “I’ve seen the problems many patients face with warfarin,” said Dr. Philip Sager, a panel member and executive committee member of the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium in San Francisco. “I think there’s a tremendous unmet medical need for new therapies.”   Analysts estimate the stroke-fighting market could top $10 billion annually. Xarelto may lose out on market share if the FDA asks the company to conduct further trials, delaying approval, analysts said.   AF patients’ irregular heartbeats can cause blood to pool, increasing their risk of blood clots and strokes. But many are unwilling to take warfarin, which requires regular blood tests, or are unable to tolerate it.   Panelists were divided on whether Xarelto, with the clinical name rivaroxaban, was as effective as warfarin.   In clinical trials that compared Xarelto to warfarin, panelists and the FDA said the older drug was not always given in the proper dosing, making it more difficult to determine if Xarelto was just as good.   “I’ve heard nothing that convinces me that rivaroxaban should be first-line treatment for many patients,” said Allan Coukell, the consumer representative on the panel and director for medical safety at Pew Health Group, adding that Xarelto’s label should reflect that.   Earlier this week, FDA reviewers said for conditions such as stroke, which can cause irreversible harm, new drugs must be shown to be at least as effective as older treatments, and called for the agency to delay Xarelto’s approval. [ID:nN1E7850CD]   In Thursday’s meeting, panel members also focused on risks for patients when they come off the drug. Patients who stopped taking Xarelto and resumed warfarin at the end of the main clinical trial had a higher risk of stroke, a so-called “rebound” effect.   “Additional data probably should be obtained regarding how to transition (off of Xarelto) prior to approval,” said Dr. Michael Lincoff, chair of the panel and professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.   The FDA is set to make the final decision on Xarelto by Nov. 4, Johnson & Johnson said.   “Given the relatively risk-adverse nature of the FDA, even with this panel’s recommendation of Xarelto, the agency may want a number of additional studies” before granting approval, said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.   “So there could be a one-to-two-year delay,” he predicted, saying that would greatly hurt the drug’s ultimate sales potential.   He said the FDA might be willing to take its time because another effective blood clot preventer, Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa, was approved last year and is already available as an alternative to warfarin.   Conover said he had expected Xarelto to eventually capture 15 percent of the stroke-prevention market among AF patients, but he now expects its market share to be below 10 percent.   Dr Peter Dibattiste, global head of J&J’s cardiovascular and metabolic division, said the company will discuss with the FDA the need for additional studies. A study looking at how long Xarelto lasted in patients could be relatively quick, “probably months,” he told reporters.   A delay for Xarelto could give the edge to a rival treatment called Eliquis being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). If Eliquis is approved, Morningstar’s Conover predicted, it could have four times the sales of Xarelto.   Eliquis, also called apixaban, showed superiority over warfarin in effectiveness, safety and saving lives in a clinical trial presented last month at a scientific meeting in Paris, affirming its place as the potential leader of the pack. [ID:nL5E7JT0KV]   Xarelto is approved in the United States and Europe for anti-clotting in patients after knee and hip surgery, a much smaller market than stroke prevention for AF patients.   Earlier this week, analysts from Sanford Bernstein forecast Xarelto sales of $948 million for J&J in 2015, and 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) for Bayer, which has much greater sales outside the United States.   Bayer said it sees peak sales of Xarelto at more than 2 billion euro ($2.8 billion), “irrespective of the decision by the FDA in early November,” according to a statement.   Bayer, which co-developed the drug with J&J, sold exclusive U.S. marketing rights for Xarelto to J&J in 2005. As part of that agreement Bayer stands to receive royalty payments of up to 30 percent on U.S. sales.   Bayer said it expects approval of Xarelto in Europe in the third or fourth quarter of this year.

138,JNJ,Aetna sees bigger profit as health claims stay low,"(Reuters) - Health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) expects to reap even greater profits this year as Americans file fewer medical claims, unable to afford more than basic health services in a weak economy.  Shares of the No. 3 U.S. health insurer rose 4.5 percent as the company said it would likely beat its own full-year 2011 earnings forecast.  Aetna’s comments on the use of health services also lifted shares of rival health insurers, with UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N) up more than 2.5 percent.  WellPoint Inc WLP.N rose 3.4 percent as it said it expects core operating earnings to rise next year.  The low use of medical services reported by Aetna is the latest sign that patients are avoiding doctors’ offices and expensive medical procedures — a trend that has persisted for more than a year.  Aetna’s new forecast came after seeing patient claim trends through July and August.  “Utilization has basically been very low, lower than expectations across the entire book business,” Chief Financial Officer Joseph Zubretsky said during a presentation at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference in New York.  The same factors have put greater pressure on healthcare providers, such as hospitals, which are seeing a greater influx of poor patients on government-funded programs and a decrease in expensive surgical procedures. Tenet Healthcare (THC.N) said on Monday a rise in admissions for patients on Medicaid would squeeze profits this year.  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso told the Morgan Stanley conference that the downturn in healthcare utilization that has hurt medical device sales is stabilizing, but the industry remains under pressure.  “We have not seen any rebound in utilization,” he said.  The government released new data on Tuesday showing that more than 46 million people were living in poverty last year, a record for the country. About 1.5 million fewer Americans were covered by employer-sponsored health insurance plans in 2010, while government health insurance enrollment increased by nearly 2 million people.  Health insurers are factoring in a rebound in claims once the economy improves. But some analysts believe the shift toward lower use of services may be permanent. Factors behind the shift include consumers having to pay more in co-payments and deductibles.  “Everybody is trying to figure whether this level of low utilization is the new normal,” Zubretsky said. Aetna is closely watching trends to determine whether claim costs could spike back up, he said.  Health insurers have been posting better-than-expected profits this year due to lower utilization. Their shares have benefited, far outperforming the broader stock market.  Aetna said it now expects to exceed its 2011 full-year operating earnings forecast of $4.60 to $4.70 per share. Analysts, on average, have been looking for $4.70, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Aetna previously increased its 2011 operating earnings forecast by more than 20 percent from its February projection.  Aetna has repurchased about $350 million of its shares during the current quarter, which will also help boost earnings per share. The company also plans to take a charge related to a pending early retirement program, but that will be excluded from operating earnings.  Aetna will provide more details about its 2011 outlook in its third-quarter earnings conference call, Zubretsky said.  Aetna projected growth next year for its Medicare plans for the elderly as well as for some plans serving large employers. That growth will partially offset projected membership losses in employer plans for which it provides administrative services only, Aetna said in a securities filing.  Aetna shares were up 4.5 percent at $40.19 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Monday, the shares had risen 26 percent this year.  In a separate presentation at the conference, WellPoint Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt said he expects higher core operating earnings from the company’s main business units next year, helped by performance in its national accounts and plans for the elderly and other individuals.  Analysts expect WellPoint’s earnings per share to increase by nearly 10 percent next year.

140,JNJ,"J&J; may buy or develop new heart devices, CFO says"," * J&J interested in heart valve, heart pump technologies   * May acquire heart device products or develop internally   * Sees healthcare utilization stabilizing, but no rebound   By Susan Kelly   Sept 13 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) is interested in adding heart valves and heart pumps to its product lineup as it reshapes its medical device portfolio but won’t overpay to acquire the technology, its chief financial officer said.   Three months after J&J announced it would stop selling drug-coated heart stents, once a key product line, CFO Dominic Caruso said the company sees other attractive technologies in the cardiac device market and could enter those markets either by acquiring another company or by developing the products organically.   He pointed to heart valves and left ventricular assist devices, which are pumps implanted in patients with advanced heart failure who are awaiting a transplant, as two promising opportunities in medical technology.   “Both are interesting. We are interested in looking at them,” said Caruso, speaking Tuesday on a webcast from an investor conference in New York.   J&J in June said it would stop selling drug-coated heart stents, a technology it pioneered but whose sales slumped in recent years due to safety concerns and fierce competition, ceding the market to Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N), Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) and Medtronic Inc (MDT.N).   Caruso said J&J exited the market because stents, which are implanted in clogged arteries to prop them open, had become a “commodity business” subject to pricing wars. Patients are well served with products already available, and the market is not rewarding companies for innovations in this area, he said.   J&J would consider acquiring a maker of heart valves or heart pumps at the right price, Caruso said. “Unfortunately,” he added, “they are overvalued today.” He did not name specific companies J&J might be interested in.   Heart valve innovator Edwards Lifesciences Corp (EW.N), an often-rumored takeover target, and heart pump makers Thoratec Corp THOR.O and Heartware International Inc HTWR.O have seen their stocks benefit from anticipation of new products in development.   Caruso said the downturn in healthcare utilization that has hurt medical device sales over the past six quarters is stabilizing, but the industry remains under pressure. Patients continue to delay treatment due to high unemployment and steeper insurance deductibles as employers shift more of the cost of care to their workers.  “We have not seen any rebound in utilization,” he said.   Industry procedure volumes will improve as the healthcare reform law brings more patients into the marketplace beginning in 2014, Caruso said.   The industry is unlikely to see a repeal of a planned 2.3 percent tax on device sales, as some have called for, Caruso said.   Caruso also said J&J’s planned $21.67 billion purchase of Swiss orthopedic device maker Synthes SYST.VX is likely to close in the first half of 2012.

141,JNJ,"Merck aims at hepatitis, c. difficile drugs","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of infectious diseases at Merck & Co said the company’s future all-oral treatments for hepatitis C and its experimental drug for infections with clostridium difficile bacteria could transform treatment and reap big sales.  Merck and biotechnology company Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc earlier this year introduced rival new oral treatments for hepatitis C that work by blocking the protein protease. But they both must be taken with an injectable interferon that prolongs treatment and causes flu-like side effects.  Roger Pomerantz, who was named head of Merck’s infectious disease segment last year, estimated the highly effective new hepatitis C drugs target only about 10 million to 15 million people in developed countries and some emerging markets.  By contrast, he said a newer all-oral treatment regimen that eliminates interferon could target as many as 180 million patients globally, including those in remote and rural regions of Africa and South America.  “We’re at just the tip of the iceberg” with current treatments, he said in an interview on Wednesday. “The big change will be when we can provide a simple, compact all-oral regimen.”  “Hepatitis C is arguably the largest market opportunity in infectious diseases in my lifetime because of the sheer numbers and the fact that we can cure it,” said Pomerantz, who headed Johnson & Johnson’s infectious disease division before being hired away by Merck.  Pomerantz said the company also has high hopes for a new way of fighting clostridium difficile (c. difficile), bacteria which are spread in hospitals and are most dangerous for the elderly and others with weakened immune systems.  The sometimes-deadly infections occur in patients who have been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics that kill off “friendly” bacteria in the gut, allowing clostridium difficile to take root and prosper there. They cause colitis, including attacks of diarrhea and fever that can recur and are not well-controlled by current treatments.  “Over the past five years there has been a new hyper-virulent strain that is more deadly than the usual c. difficile, so we have a perfect storm” situation, Pomerantz said.

142,JNJ,J&J; pleads guilty in Natrecor marketing case,"(Reuters) - Johnson and Johnson has agreed to pay $85 million and plead guilty to U.S. government charges that it marketed heart drug Natrecor for unapproved uses, according to court documents.  J&J’s Scios unit was charged in July with misbranding Natrecor because the drug’s labeling lacked adequate directions for its use. Natrecor is approved for treatment of certain patients with congestive heart failure.

145,JNJ,Banking on Botox no concern for Allergan CEO,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allergan Inc (AGN.N) is not worried about over-reliance on sales of its flagship Botox drug, the company’s chief said, citing extensive safety data and supply reserves of the injectable medicine.  The wrinkle-smoothing treatment recently won U.S. approval to treat migraine headaches and overactive bladders, positioning it for an even bigger chunk of Allergan’s sales than the 30 percent it commands now.  Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott told Reuters he expects Botox sales to exceed $1 billion apiece for cosmetic and therapeutic use. Allergan forecasts nearly $1.6 billion in Botox sales this year.  “It’s just a question of when do we cruise past the $2 billion mark,” Pyott said in an interview in New York on Monday. “In theory, it could even grow beyond that (30 percent of sales).”  The company has about nine months worth of stock of Botox around the world should it encounter some type of supply constraint.  “Running out of Botox would be a very bad idea,” Pyott said.  Pyott also brushed aside safety concerns for the product, pointing to 20 years of data that “is not only great for us but for regulators. They feel, even in relatively high doses, there’s a lot known about this compound.”  Allergan’s reliance on Botox is a risk, said Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse, especially if competitors make inroads. While smaller companies have struggled with their Botox-like drugs, Waterhouse cites a looming threat from a Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) product named PurTox that could reach the market by 2013.  Waterhouse said Allergan stock, which has outperformed most large drugmaker shares this year, is fairly valued.  “Because we do see more competitors emerging, companies like Johnson & Johnson that have the wherewithal to go toe-to-toe with someone like Allergan, I do think they’ll need to continue to diversify the business,” Waterhouse said.  Pyott is aware of that need and wants to add to Allergan’s product portfolio across its six therapeutic areas that involve medicines prescribed by specialists. They include neurology, where Botox has helped establish the company’s presence.  Allergan has licensed from MAP Pharmaceuticals Inc MAPP.O rights to Levadex, an experimental migraine treatment that the company expects to be approved next year.  With many migraine treatments being sold as generics, Pyott expects Allergan to be one of the only companies actively promoting the drugs to doctors, giving it an advantage.  “We like quiet places, because if you’re the only guy, you’re appreciated,” he said.  Pyott is also interested in other neurology areas, such as drugs for epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.  “We keep looking externally to see if there are things that fit into the category where the bulk of prescriptions are generated by the neurologist.”  Beyond licensing products, Pyott said the company could easily do an acquisition of more than $1 billion, and pointed to its $3.3 billion purchase in 2006 of Inamed, a maker of breast implants and the Lap-Band gastric banding device.  Pyott said the largest deal he ever considered exceeded $10 billion, without naming the company. But he would be cautious about such a sizable deal for Allergan, which has a market value of about $24 billion.  Allergan's specialty focus, which also includes a large eye-drug franchise, has won favor on Wall Street. The stock is up 12 percent this year, against a 3 percent decline of the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index .DRG of large drugmakers and a 9 percent decline for the broader S&P 500 .SPX.  Pyott said he was hopeful the company would achieve mid-teens percentage earnings per share growth for the next four or five years.  Botox is fueling sales, Pyott said, as are 2010 approvals of new versions of its Lumigan glaucoma drug and Juvederm dermal filler.

146,JNJ,Boston Scientific taps J&J; executive as its next CEO,"(Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp named Johnson & Johnson’s top medical device executive to be its new president and chief executive, snaring an experienced leader from its larger rival.  Michael Mahoney, 46, who is chairman of J&J’s medical device and diagnostics business, will become Boston Scientific’s president on October 17 and is expected to become CEO next year on Nov 1, 2012. The delay in assuming the CEO post accommodates Mahoney’s post-employment obligations with J&J, Boston Scientific said.  Mahoney replaces Ray Elliott, who announced in May that he intended to step down.  “J&J’s medical device business is the world’s largest, so this is somewhat of a coup for Boston Scientific in our view,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst Larry Biegelsen said.  A J&J spokesman said Alex Gorsky, vice chairman of the company’s executive committee, would assume leadership of the medical device and diagnostics group at J&J.  Hank Kucheman, Boston Scientific executive vice president, will serve as Boston Scientific’s interim CEO until Mahoney assumes that role. Kucheman who now leads Boston Scientific’s cardiology, rhythm and vascular group, the company’s largest unit, will also join Boston Scientific’s board of directors.  Elliott, who announced plans to retire after two years at the helm of the struggling medical device maker, will assist Kucheman and Mahoney through the end of the year in the transition to their new roles. Elliott will remain on the company’s board.  Boston Scientific is facing sluggish growth in its core heart device markets, which generate about 70 percent of the company’s total revenue. A slowdown in medical procedures in the weak economy has hurt device sales as patients postpone care.  Safety concerns and fierce competition have dampened revenue from stents that treat clogged arteries, while implantable defibrillators are under scrutiny from a Justice Department investigation into whether the devices are being used in the wrong patients.  Analysts said Mahoney has the right credentials to tackle the job of turning around Boston Scientific, noting J&J’s $26 billion medical device division alone is roughly three times the size of its smaller rival in the medical technology sector.  “Mr. Mahoney brings a wealth of medtech and healthcare experience with him, which will help him hit the ground running,” said Collins Stewart analyst Tao Levy. “We would be interested in better understanding his reasons for joining Boston Scientific given the challenges that lie ahead.”  Boston Scientific has been slashing costs and revamping its product portfolio as it works to turn around its business.  Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy said Mahoney’s biggest task will be to accelerate revenue growth, without which Boston Scientific’s stock is likely to remain stuck near all-time lows.  “The next guy coming in is inheriting all these problems. But he’s a young guy, and he’s got time on his side, right,” Denhoy said.  Mahoney was named head of J&J’s medical device and diagnostics group in January and led its DePuy orthopedics business before that. He also was an executive in General Electric Co’s healthcare unit for 12 years.  Boston Scientific’s stock closed up 4 cents at $6.26 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

148,JNJ,Analysis: New drugs drive prostate cancer market,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Options for treating prostate cancer are expanding with the advent of novel, and more expensive, medicines, with key data expected soon for what could be one of the biggest new drugs.  After surgery or radiation, prostate cancer patients are typically treated with drugs, like Lupron, that trick the testicles into ceasing production of testosterone, the male hormone that fuels prostate cancer cell growth.  Better understanding of the molecular abnormalities underlying the disease has led to new approaches, including Johnson & Johnson’s Zytiga, which works inside cancer cells to block testosterone production, and Dendreon Corp’s Provenge, a therapeutic vaccine designed to spur the body’s immune system to attack malignant cells.  Decision Resources, a healthcare advisory firm, expects global sales of prostate cancer drugs to more than double from nearly $4 billion in 2009 to $8.9 billion in 2019.  “We now have more effective agents targeting the androgen (testosterone) receptor,” said Dr. Elizabeth Plimack, an oncologist at Philadelphia’s Fox Chase Cancer Center. “At some point all patients will probably be completely resistant to these drugs ... ultimately we need a new approach.”  Medivation Inc is developing a drug, known as MDV3100, designed to interfere with the ability of testosterone to bind to prostate cells.  Full results from a pivotal trial of MDV3100 are due next year, but there is widespread debate over whether an interim analysis — expected before the end of this year — might prove that MDV3100 is effective and the trial could be stopped early.  If that happens, shares of Medivation — which closed at $18.94 on Monday — would jump to $30 or $35, according to Citigroup analyst Lucy Lu. If, however, the interim analysis is negative, she expects the stock to fall below $10.  “MDV3100 is certainly promising ... but we haven’t seen the data yet,” said Dr. Plimack.  Optimism about the Medivation trial centers on the fact that J&J’s pivotal trial of Zytiga, which had shown similar efficacy in earlier studies, was stopped as soon as it became clear that the drug improved survival.  Investor interest in Medivation has waned since March 2010, when the company announced the failure of a Phase 3 trial for its experimental Alzheimer’s drug.  Wall Street analysts, on average, expect the company’s sales of MDV3100 to reach $297 million by 2015, with sales by development partner Astellas Pharma forecast at $89 million, according to Thomson Reuters data.  J&J’s Zytiga sales, which have exceeded expectations since the drug’s approval in April, are forecast to reach $815 million by 2015.  The sales trajectory for Provenge remains uncertain. Analysts expect 2015 sales of nearly $1.3 billion, but that is down sharply from a nearly $2 billion average estimate before Dendreon stunned investors in August by withdrawing its own sales forecast because it was taking longer than expected for doctors to become comfortable with reimbursement issues.  “Provenge is very exciting because it is the first immunotherapy for prostate cancer, but it is fraught with logistical issues,” Dr. Plimack said. “Centers are nervous to take on the cost in case reimbursement doesn’t come through.”  A course of treatment with Provenge costs $93,000, while Zytiga costs $5,000 a month, usually for eight cycles.  New York area oncologists and urologists polled in a recent focus group conducted by Sanford Bernstein said Zytiga and others drugs in the same class will be used in as many as 40 percent of patients by 2015, hormonal therapies will still be used in up to 90 percent of patients, and anti-androgens like MDV3100 would be used in 70 percent to 80 percent of men with prostate cancer.  Bernstein said both groups of doctors expect Provenge to be used in up to 12 percent of patients.  Prostate cancer kills about 250,000 men a year globally and is the second most common cause of cancer death in men in the United States, after lung cancer.  Over the longer-term, drugmakers aim to move new therapies into earlier lines of treatment, possibly helping patients avoid side effects, like medical castration, that are common with current hormone-altering drugs or to reduce the need for harsh chemotherapy treatments.  In addition to MDV3100, prostate cancer medicines under development include custirsen from OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals Inc and Exelixis Inc’s cabozatinib.  For supportive care, Amgen Inc’s Xgeva prevents fractures and other bone problems in cancer patients and the company is seeking to expand its use to reduce the risk of bone metastases in certain prostate cancer patients.  Bayer AG has filed for use of Alpharadin in men whose prostate cancer has started spreading to bones.

152,JNJ,Advisers urge FDA to address antipsychotics in kids,"GAITHERSBURG, Maryland (Reuters) - U.S. pediatric health advisers on Thursday urged drug regulators to continue studying weight gain and other side-effects of antipsychotic drugs as they are increasingly taken by children.  The pediatric advisory committee voted 16-1 to support the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s routine safety monitoring of the new generation of antipsychotics.  But they did so with a caveat that the agency specifically looks at how to clarify the drugs’ labels to highlight concerns of their impact on children, namely the risks of weight gain and diabetes.  “We ask that with this upcoming revision that you carefully consider the language around pediatric use and adverse events,” said Dr. Geoffrey Rosenthal, the committee’s chair and director of Pediatric and Congenital Heart Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center.  The FDA in the next month to six weeks will release a revised label for Abilify, sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Otsuka Pharmaceutical, which is one of the antipsychotic drugs approved for use in children.  The new label will detail the drug’s latest clinical trials, warn of metabolic concerns and remind doctors to monitor patient weight and symptoms of diabetes, said Dr. Tom Laughren, FDA’s psychiatry products chief.  The new generation of antipsychotic medications has raised a wave of concerns as they are increasingly being prescribed for a host of uses and for younger and younger patients, with little conclusive research addressing their impact on children and sometimes with little evidence they work.  Newer antipsychotics include Johnson & Johnson’s Risperdal, known generically as risperidone; Eli Lilly & Co’s Zyprexa or olanzapine; AstraZeneca’s Seroquel or quetiapine; and Abilify, known generically as aripiprazole.  U.S. researchers have found that the drugs’ use in children increased by 65 percent from 2002 to 2009, primarily through prescriptions for teenagers.  From fall 2009 to spring of this year, 1.9 million prescriptions were written for patients under 18, most commonly for bipolar disorder in teenagers and toddlers aged 3 to 6, and for affective psychoses in children between the ages of 7 and 12.

154,JNJ,"Bristol CEO says ""pure pharma"" strategy paying off","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Chief Executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said the company intends to remain “100 percent” in prescription medicines and is prepared to use its $10 billion cash hoard to gain new drugs through moderate size deals with other drugmakers.  Lamberto Andreotti also told scores of industry executives and analysts that the company’s recently approved Yervoy medicine for metastatic melanoma continues to generate good initial sales.  “We will continue to remain 100 percent pharma,” Andreotti said at the Pharmaceutical Strategic Alliances Conference in New York. He said it was beneficial to have “the entire management team strictly focused on one business.”  “We can continue to be successful as 100 percent pharma,” said Andreotti, whose company is deemed by many analysts to have the strongest lineup of recently approved drugs and medicines in the late stages of development in the industry.  The 153-year old company now focuses completely on prescription medicines after having divested its consumer product, medical devices and nutritional products divisions. Its former brands include Excedrin and Bufferin headache medicines and Convatec wound-healing products.  Two years ago the company spun off its majority stake in Mead Johnson, a leading nutritionals company that sells Enfamil baby formula, to focus on traditional prescription pills and sophisticated biotech drugs.  Meanwhile, big rivals such as Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co Inc, Novartis AG, Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi SA say they get more reliable profit growth from an array of product lines, including animal health, consumer healthcare products and low-cost generics.  And unlike larger drugmakers such as Pfizer and Merck that have grown by gobbling up rivals through huge deals, Andreotti says Bristol has avoided going down that path.  “We didn’t have to go through the disruption of mergers,” he said, noting that the 1989 Bristol-Myers tie up with Squibb was many years before his time at the helm.  Bristol-Myers has captured attention for Yervoy, a biotech drug that spurs the immune system to fight advanced melanoma — the deadliest form of skin cancer. It was approved in March and some analysts expect it to eventually generate annual sales of $6 billion as the first approved drug shown to extend survival of such patients.  Yervoy, which costs $120,000 for a full course of treatment, chalked up second quarter sales of $95 million — its first quarter on the market.  Andreotti declined to discuss Yervoy sales for the third quarter, but said the drug “continues to do well.”  Bristol-Myers acquired Yervoy through its $2.4 billion purchase of Medarex Inc in 2009.

155,JNJ,"Bristol CEO says ""pure pharma"" strategy paying off"," * Yervoy sales still doing well   * $10 bln cash holdings will back drug deals   * Large deals not necessary   By Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot   NEW YORK, Sept 22 (Reuters) - The Chief Executive of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) said the company intends to remain “100 percent” in prescription medicines and is prepared to use its $10 billion cash hoard to gain new drugs through moderate size deals with other drugmakers.   Lamberto Andreotti also told scores of industry executives and analysts that the company’s recently approved Yervoy medicine for metastatic melanoma continues to generate good initial sales.   “We will continue to remain 100 percent pharma,” Andreotti said at the Pharmaceutical Strategic Alliances Conference in New York. He said it was beneficial to have “the entire management team strictly focused on one business.”   “We can continue to be successful as 100 percent pharma,” said Andreotti, whose company is deemed by many analysts to have the strongest lineup of recently approved drugs and medicines in the late stages of development in the industry.   The 153-year old company now focuses completely on prescription medicines after having divested its consumer product, medical devices and nutritional products divisions. Its former brands include Excedrin and Bufferin headache medicines and Convatec wound-healing products.   Two years ago the company spun off its majority stake in Mead Johnson, a leading nutritionals company that sells Enfamil baby formula, to focus on traditional prescription pills and sophisticated biotech drugs.   Meanwhile, big rivals such as Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), Novartis AG NOVN.VX, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) say they get more reliable profit growth from an array of product lines, including animal health, consumer healthcare products and low-cost generics.   And unlike larger drugmakers such as Pfizer and Merck that have grown by gobbling up rivals through huge deals, Andreotti says Bristol has avoided going down that path.   “We didn’t have to go through the disruption of mergers,” he said, noting that the 1989 Bristol-Myers tie up with Squibb was many years before his time at the helm.   Bristol-Myers has captured attention for Yervoy, a biotech drug that spurs the immune system to fight advanced melanoma — the deadliest form of skin cancer. It was approved in March and some analysts expect it to eventually generate annual sales of $6 billion as the first approved drug shown to extend survival of such patients.   Yervoy, which costs $120,000 for a full course of treatment, chalked up second quarter sales of $95 million — its first quarter on the market.   Andreotti declined to discuss Yervoy sales for the third quarter, but said the drug “continues to do well.”   Bristol-Myers acquired Yervoy through its $2.4 billion purchase of Medarex Inc in 2009. The company generates more than half of its revenue from deals it has made with other drugmakers, most far less costly than the Medarex transaction.   Andreotti noted that earlier on Thursday the company announced a collaboration with Ambrx Inc for an upfront payment of $24 million that gives Bristol-Myers access to drugs for type 2 diabetes and heart failure that he called “potential best-in-class” medicines.

156,JNJ,"HOW TO PLAY IT: As gold turns to dust, cleaning up portfolios"," THE ISSUE: In years past, gold often acted as a safe haven when stocks were falling, and it hit a record in August while equities struggled. Now, however, it’s mired in its worst selloff in decades. What does it mean for investors who see gold as a core portfolio holding?   NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Investors love hard assets like gold when financial markets are stressed. That should be true now since fear is running high, except for one factor: It’s the wrong kind of stress.   For gold, a strong dollar is kryptonite. The Greek tragedy in Europe is slamming the euro and giving a lift to the dollar. As the U.S. currency crops, gold, which is priced in dollars, gains in value, and inflation fears also rise.   The phenomenon of falling stocks and rising dollar has not been seen since 2008’s collapse, when a buying frenzy in safe T-bills fueled a dollars surge. The conditions may not be so dire now. But there are some similarities.   Still,the dollar has been on a long-term decline and with its new, less-than-AAA-rated government debt, the U.S. currency should soon resume its decline. That,in turn, would restore gold’s appeal. Right?   Not so fast, say strategists. Investors need to be wary. The gold rush of 2011 is over for now. Here is why they think it’s time to down picks and shovels:   The gold rally really got crazy. One strategist abides by former money manager Jim Rogers’s axiom “Sell euphoria, buy panic.” When gold hit its record high in August, it had been on a virtually non-stop, decade-long 600 percent upswing. Its decline has been dramatic as well, with a 9 percent pullback in the past two days.   “For the past seven weeks, I have been telling people to rebalance gold and sell partial positions on gold,” said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James Financial.   Stocks would hardly seem to be a safe alternative to gold bullion, especially after the recent volatility in equities. But strategists see unrecognized value in stocks. In place of suddenly shaky gold, Saut recommended buying conservative yields, specifically Health Care REIT HCN.N and EV Energy Partners EVEP.O.  Another strategist, David Kotok, CIO of Cumberland Advisors,said “The U.S. stock market is cheap. The dividend yield on the S&P 500 index exceeds the interest income on a 10-year riskless US treasury note, which is a very rare occurrence.”   Kotok says to invest in dividend-paying stocks, and ETFs in the same vein. He cites Wisdom Tree Dividend ex-Financials Fund (DTN.N).   The safe haven that replaced gold in 2008 was U.S. government debt. Strategist Michael Jones, CIO of Riverfront Investment Group thinks its time to go back to that safe place.   “Fears could flip to financial system collapse and gold would be wiped out. Just look at how it performed after Lehman,” said Michael Jones, CIO of Riverfront Investment Group.   Jones is in favor of long bond ETFs with high yield.”A combination of high yield and long bonds give a risk profile similar to the Lehman aggregate, but with three times the yield.”Jones mentioned iShares Barclays 20-Year Treasury Bond ETF TLT.N, SPDR Lehman High-Yield Bond ETF (JNK.N) and PowerShares High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (PHB.N) as high-yield ETFs worth looking at.   Some argue that gold-mining stocks are a better long-term play, and a less volatile way to extract value from precious metals futures.    “Certainly valuations are better for gold mining companies than gold directly,” said Kate Warne, Edward Jones investment strategist. “But gold mining is energy intensive, and the costs for mining have gone up. So, with production costs, if it’s going up, you may not make as much money.”    Al Abaroa, market strategist at Kingsview Financial, said that gold funds do not offer much protection: “I don’t think you can avoid the volatility.”   “As gold approached $2000 an ounce, it got as overvalued relative to inflation as it got in the late 1970s and early ‘80s.” Jones said.   The problem, said Frank Cholly of MF Global, is that gold does not act like “real” commodities such as corn and wheat, which repel investors when their prices rise.   Gold bugs jump on board when the precious metal starts to heat up.   “When gold gets expensive, it gets more attractive, and it should be the opposite.”   Cholly advised investors to remain bearish on gold. “At these levels, you have to be very careful. If you’re not already long in gold, be careful when you buy it.”  “Everyone wants to raise cash because there’s a global panic,”  said Abaroa. “It’s not that the dollar has terrific merits in itself, but it is better than the euro.”  That is bad for gold — but not good for nothing. Some stocks will benefit from a stronger dollar. Retailers who sell important goods, for example. But strategists saw risks in trading currencies themselves.   “I would recommend that investors not make currency bets, said Warne. Instead look for “companies with solid cash flows, which pay dividends, and have potential for dividend increases in the future.” Johnson and Johnson (JNJ.N), Procter & Gamble (PG.N), Intel (INTC.O), and United Technologies (UTX.N) were her picks.

157,JNJ,J&J; recalls Eprex anemia drug from 17 countries," * About 6,300 prefilled syringes involved in recall   * No adverse events or harm to patients reported   Sept 23 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), which has been beset by manufacturing problems and product recalls over the past two years, has recalled thousands of prefilled syringes of its Eprex anemia drug due to inconsistent potency, the diversified healthcare company said.   Two batches of the red blood cell booster — originally containing about 200,000 syringes —  were involved in the voluntary recall from 17 countries, including Britain, France and Germany.   There have been no reports of harm to patients from the affected Eprex batches, said J&J spokesman Stefan Gijssels.   “The batches were already delivered to market quite a while ago, so we assume the majority has already been consumed,” Gijssels said in a telephone interview on Friday.   J&J estimates that there should be less than 6,300 syringes remaining on the market that are actually affected by the recall.   “The company is working with regulatory authorities in 17 countries to voluntarily execute a recall of two batches of Eprex as a safety precaution,” Gijssels said.   A routine internal quality analysis found that a number of the syringes contained Eprex that was either above or below the required potencies, he said.   Health regulators have placed tight potency restrictions on the use of Eprex and similar anemia drugs over safety concerns. Eprex, which is sold in the United States under the brand name Procrit, is primarily used to help anemic chronic kidney disease patients avoid blood transfusions.   Eprex and Procrit had combined sales of about $2 billion in 2010.   J&J has endured waves of recalls across its various product lines, including hundreds of millions of bottles of adult and children’s consumer medicines, such as Tylenol. The company has also had to recall faulty hip replacements, contact lenses, schizophrenia drugs and many other products over the past two years, and was forced to place some of its manufacturing plants under U.S. government supervision.   The other countries involved in the latest recall were Canada, Spain, Italy, Sweden, Russia, Belgium, Portugal, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Albania, Egypt, Israel and Taiwan, the company said.

158,JNJ,U.S. advisers urge FDA to address antipsychotics in kids,"GAITHERSBURG, Maryland (Reuters) - U.S. pediatric health advisers on Thursday urged drug regulators to continue studying weight gain and other side-effects of antipsychotic drugs as they are increasingly taken by children.  Significant numbers of U.S. children are receiving drugs to tame aggression, attention deficit disorder and other mental problems, even though there is little conclusive data to show exactly how the medications work or whether they damage kids’ health.  The pediatric advisory panel on Thursday listened to preliminary results of a study sponsored in part by the FDA that, inconclusively still, compared whether some antipsychotic drugs put children at a higher risk of developing diabetes than others.  Similar to the recommendations the panel has made in previous years, it voted 16-1 to support the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s routine safety monitoring of the new generation of antipsychotics.  But the panel did so with a caveat that the agency specifically look at how to clarify the drugs’ labels to highlight concerns about their impact on children, namely the risks of weight gain and diabetes.  “There is serious concern that children may be at a higher risk for serious adverse effects and we just don’t have sufficient data to answer that question,” said Dr. Jonathan Mink, a child neurology expert from the University of Rochester Medical Center.  Dr. Jeffrey Wagener, a pediatric pulmonologist from the University of Colorado Medical School, was the one adviser to vote “no” out of concern that wouldn’t get regulators closer to dealing with the risks of using antipsychotics in children.  “I don’t see how the FDA is responding to the December 8, 2009 request by this committee in a thorough fashion,” he said. “It’s taken them two years to not respond to that that we need to be more than in the observational role.”  The FDA in the next month to six weeks will release a revised label for Abilify, a drug sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Otsuka Pharmaceutical and approved to treat schizophrenia in adolescents, bipolar disorder in children 10 to 17 years old and irritability associated with autism in those as young as six.  “We ask that with this upcoming revision that you carefully consider the language around pediatric use and adverse events,” said Dr. Geoffrey Rosenthal, the committee’s chair and director of Pediatric and Congenital Heart Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center.  Abilify’s new label will detail the drug’s latest clinical trials, warn of metabolic concerns and remind doctors to monitor weight and symptoms of diabetes in all patients, said Dr. Thomas Laughren, FDA’s psychiatry products chief. The pediatric section of the label would contain a reference to those warnings, he said..  Such revisions, which are already incorporated into Johnson & Johnson’s antipsychotic medication Invega Sustenna, are being considered for other similar drugs on a case by case basis, Laughren said.  The new generation of antipsychotic medications has raised a wave of concerns as they are increasingly being prescribed for a host of uses and for younger and younger patients, with little conclusive research addressing their impact on children and sometimes with little evidence they work.  Newer antipsychotics include J&J’s Risperdal, known generically as risperidone; Eli Lilly & Co’s Zyprexa or olanzapine; AstraZeneca’s Seroquel or quetiapine; and Abilify, known generically as aripiprazole.  U.S. researchers have found that the drugs’ use in children increased by 65 percent from 2002 to 2009, primarily through prescriptions for teenagers.  From fall 2009 to spring of this year, 1.9 million prescriptions of Abilify alone were dispensed to patients under 18, including even 875 prescriptions for toddlers younger than 2, according to FDA research.  Most commonly, the prescriptions were for bipolar disorder in teenagers and preschoolers, and for affective psychoses in children between the ages of seven and 12.  Advisers also voted unanimously to require the FDA to show them label revisions and report back in the next year or 18 months on progress in designing more studies of the drugs in children.

160,JNJ,Medtech's new normal: pushback on procedures," * Ernst & Young report details pressures on device makers   * Finds companies will need to prove value to compete   By Susan Kelly   CHICAGO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Medical technology companies are under intensifying pressure to demonstrate that their products improve patients’ lives and make the healthcare system more efficient, a report from Ernst & Young concludes.   Government and private insurers’ efforts to rein in healthcare costs are straining hospital budgets, prompting a harder look at the value of comparable treatments. Hospitals are also standardizing purchasing decisions and relying less on physicians’ preferences for one brand of device over another in their efforts to cut costs.   At the same time, regulators are stepping up their scrutiny of new product applications, and patients are taking a more active role in choosing among treatment options.   “It is now becoming increasingly clear that medtech faces its own new normal,” the report said. The findings were scheduled to be presented on Tuesday at an industry meeting in Washington.   To compete, device makers will need to quantify successful patient outcomes as well as the cost effectiveness of the treatment, said John Babitt, head of Ernst & Young’s medtech practice for the Americas.   “The days of selling devices through sales reps who have a good relationship with a physician are numbered, if not over,” Babitt said in a telephone interview.   “Where we really see the battle lines being drawn, especially as physicians migrate more toward being hospital employees, is in negotiations with hospital payers, hospital administrators and the office of procurement,” he said.   More hospitals are relying on technology assessment committees and group purchasing organizations to consolidate purchasing decisions. Physicians who once had free reign to pick the device they preferred may find their options limited.   “In many cases, hospitals are imposing price caps or reducing the number of vendors from which they will purchase,” according to the report.   Ernst & Young found a disconnect between the medical technology industry’s rebound in growth as it has emerged from the depths of the recession and investors’ perceptions of the sector’s prospects.   Revenue for public medical technology companies totaled $315.9 billion in 2010, up 4 percent from the year before. Income for non-conglomerates in the United States and Europe, excluding one-time charges, increased 9 percent, last year.   Yet device company stocks, which have historically traded at a premium to the Standard & Poor’s 500 index, now trade at a discount, Babitt noted. “That is attributable to a perception that there is a lack of innovation to fuel growth,” he said.   Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) Vice Chairman Alex Gorsky said the medical device industry can take lessons from the pharmaceutical sector, which began struggling with similar challenges a decade ago.   It’s likely that changes brought by the current economic crisis, including tighter regulation, lower prices and stricter utilization standards, are here to stay, Gorsky said in comments contained in the report.   The industry needs to pay attention to how it is perceived as it addresses the safety, efficacy and affordability of medical devices, Gorsky said.   “Will we be seen as a faceless, uncaring industry that places profits ahead of people? Or will we be seen as an industry that “gets it,” that is helping to improve the lives of tens of millions of people every day and understands the need to do our fair share in order to bring our products and services to even more people in the years ahead?” he wrote.

The transaction also gives J&J (JNJ.N) exclusive rights to other consumer brands sold by the two companies in the United States and Canada through their 22-year-old joint venture, while Merck retains rights to Pepcid outside North America, Merck said in a release.  The deal also gives J&J full ownership of the joint venture’s manufacturing plant in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where Mylanta and Pepcid — formerly a top-selling Merck prescription drug — are made.  U.S. regulators in July 2010 cited a dozen quality-control problems at the factory that paved the way for widely publicized recalls of Pepcid.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration highlighted problems with test procedures and record-keeping at the factory.

166,JNJ,UPDATE 1-US court upholds blood vessel stent ruling," * Boston Scientific did not infringe J&J unit patent   * Appeals court declines to find two patents tainted   Sept 28 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court said Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) did not infringe a patent by Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) Cordis unit related to a stent used to treat coronary artery disease, but could not block the enforcement of two patents.   Wednesday’s ruling in the 14-year-old case by the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest in a long line of litigation over stents between the companies.   The dispute concerned balloon-expandable stents, which are used to treat blocked blood vessels as an alternative to more invasive coronary bypass surgery.   Cordis initially sued Boston Scientific in 1997.   Wednesday’s ruling upheld a lower court judge’s decision that Boston Scientific’s NIR stent did not literally infringe a Cordis patent.   It also said Boston Scientific failed to show that the patent and one other were tainted because the original patentees, when applying for the patents, hid information from the U.S. agency that eventually granted approval.   Boston Scientific has about $1.5 billion of annual stent sales. In June, J&J said Cordis would stop selling drug-coated heart stents, after losing market share to Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) as well as Boston Scientific.

169,JNJ,Kraft boss bumps Pepsi chief as top U.S. woman exec,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kraft Foods boss Irene Rosenfeld is the most powerful woman in U.S. business, Fortune magazine said on Thursday, bumping PepsiCo Inc chief Indra Nooyi into second spot after five years on top.  The 14th annual ranking was determined by the size and importance of the woman’s business in the global economy, the health and direction of the business, the arc of the woman’s career and her social and cultural relevance.  “Rosenfeld made a big show of power this year with her decision to split Kraft into two companies, a reversal of her previous strategy of expanding through acquisitions,” Fortune magazine said of the Kraft chief executive, who led a hostile $18 billion takeover of Britain’s Cadbury last year.  “On Nooyi’s watch, PepsiCo has forged further into nutrition-focused products,” Fortune said. “But Nooyi has been criticized for taking her eye off the core North American soda business, which has lost share to Coke.”  Nooyi was the only woman in the top 10 most powerful to be among the top 10 highest paid, coming in at No. 9 after earning $14 million last year. The highest paid woman was Oracle President Safra Catz with $42 million.  Just a week after being appointed chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Co, Meg Whitman — who was chief executive of eBay Inc until 2008 and last year ran a failed bid to become governor of California — returned to the ranking of the top 50 most powerful business women at No. 9.  “While her ascent to the role is a sure sign of her power, it remains to be seen if she can fix the computer maker and bring order to its dysfunctional board,” Fortune said.  Whitman filled a top 10 vacancy left by the firing over the phone last month of Yahoo Inc Chief Executive Carol Bartz, who has now dropped off the Fortune list.  Media mogul Oprah Winfrey fell 10 spots to No. 16 with Fortune saying her influence had waned after hosting the final season of “The Oprah Winfrey Show” in May.

170,JNJ,Kraft boss bumps Pepsi chief as top US woman exec," * Whitman returns to power list week after HP appointment   * Oracle president highest paid, earning $42 million   * Stronger business focus on adding women to boardrooms   By Michelle Nichols   NEW YORK, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Kraft Foods KFT.N boss Irene Rosenfeld is the most powerful woman in U.S. business, Fortune magazine said on Thursday, bumping PepsiCo Inc PEP.N chief Indra Nooyi into second spot after five years on top.   The 14th annual ranking was determined by the size and importance of the woman’s business in the global economy, the health and direction of the business, the arc of the woman’s career and her social and cultural relevance.   “Rosenfeld made a big show of power this year with her decision to split Kraft into two companies, a reversal of her previous strategy of expanding through acquisitions,” Fortune magazine said of the Kraft chief executive, who led a hostile $18 billion takeover of Britain’s Cadbury last year.   “On Nooyi’s watch, PepsiCo has forged further into nutrition-focused products,” Fortune said. “But Nooyi has been criticized for taking her eye off the core North American soda business, which has lost share to Coke.”   Nooyi was the only woman in the top 10 most powerful to be among the top 10 highest paid, coming in at No. 9 after earning $14 million last year. The highest paid woman was Oracle ORCL.O President Safra Catz with $42 million.   Just a week after being appointed chief executive of Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), Meg Whitman — who was chief executive of eBay Inc (EBAY.O) until 2008 and last year ran a failed bid to become governor of California — returned to the ranking of the top 50 most powerful business women at No. 9.   “While her ascent to the role is a sure sign of her power, it remains to be seen if she can fix the computer maker and bring order to its dysfunctional board,” Fortune said.   Whitman filled a top 10 vacancy left by the firing over the phone last month of Yahoo Inc YHOO.O Chief Executive Carol Bartz, who has now dropped off the Fortune list.   Media mogul Oprah Winfrey fell 10 spots to No. 16 with Fortune saying her influence had waned after hosting the final season of “The Oprah Winfrey Show” in May.

171,JNJ,Bayer says Xarelto prevents heart attacks," FRANKFURT, Sept 30 (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer (BAYGn.DE) said its potential blockbuster drug Xarelto was shown to prevent heart attacks in patients that have already suffered one.	   Xarelto led to a statistically significant reduction in heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular deaths in patients who had suffered from acute coronary syndrome (ACS), an umbrella term for heart attack and a range of similar symptoms, the company said.	   The phase III study, which compared patients on Xarel with a group receiving the current standard therapy plus placebo, also showed statistical evidence the Xarelto pill led to a higher risk of major bleeding.	   Bayer, which is co-developing the drug with U.S. group Johnson & Johnson , said it planned to present detailed trial results as soon as possible at a scientific congress. It also plans to file for market authorisation by the year-end.	   The use in ACS patients accounts for about 15 percent of the drug’s potential overall market, when measured by treatment days, according to 2009 data posted on Bayer’s Website.	   The drug’s largest market by far is stroke prevention in mainly elderly patients that suffer from a common form of irregular heart beat. For this use the pill was endorsed by European regulators last week.

172,JNJ,COLUMN-Judge tosses suit against J&J; board,"   -- Alison Frankel writes the On the Case blog for Thomson Reuters News & Insight (newsandinsight.com). The views expressed are her own. --   By Alison Frankel   NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - In August, when Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) disclosed its deal to resolve criminal allegations that it falsely marketed the potent schizophrenic drug Risperdal, I said that if ever a board was ripe for a big, fat, shareholder derivative suit, it was J&J’s.   The Risperdal settlement was the company’s third criminal plea in a little more than a year, on top of a Justice Department and Food and Drug Administration investigation of its over-the-counter childrens’ drugs, state attorney general subpoenas, whistleblower suits and product recalls.   The 111-page consolidated complaint that Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann and Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd filed against J&J’s board members last December offered more red flags than a training school for toreadors.   Judge Freda Wolfson of New Jersey federal court agreed in a Sept. 30 opinion that the allegations the plaintiffs firms had raised were “troubling and pervasive,” noting in particular that claims the board ignored systemic illegal conduct were “disconcerting to the court.”   Near the end of the ruling, after analyzing all of the shareholders’ assertions, the judge cited “what appears to be serious corporate misconduct on J&J’s part.”   And then she threw out the case.   Judge Wolfson found that the shareholders’ complaint didn’t offer sufficiently specific evidence that individual board members were aware of problems at the company and nevertheless failed to do anything. “None of the various types of red flags suggest that the board acted in bad faith,” the judge wrote.   “Adding all of those allegations together does not lead me to a different conclusion in this case. While plaintiffs’ allegations are disconcerting, they do not contain the (requisite) detail.”   I could retread the judge’s examination of each and every one of the assertions Bernstein Litowitz and Robbins Geller raised, explaining why the judge found their evidence insufficient. I could point out Judge Wolfson’s apparent irritation with the plaintiffs firms for failing to quote specifics from the J&J regulatory filings they cite.   (“It is not the court’s obligation to wade through pages of documents to locate the language plaintiffs seek to invoke,” she wrote.)   Or I could explain the debate over whether the allegations against J&J should be weighed in the aggregate or one at a time.   But I think it’s more valuable to consider the big picture. Judge Wolfson’s dismissal of the J&J case before shareholders even had a chance to conduct discovery suit proves exactly what I argued in a recent column: The law makes it virtually impossible to hold corporate board members accountable through shareholder litigation.   Start with the choice Bernstein Litowitz and Robbins Geller made at the very beginning of this suit.   Shareholders can take two paths in derivative cases. They can either serve a demand for action on the board or they can proceed with their claims on the theory that it would be futile to make such a demand.   Bernstein and Robbins chose the latter course. They were right, of course, that the J&J board would never have decided to sue its own members.   In fact, a different set of plaintiffs lawyers did serve a demand on the J&J board, which formed a special litigation committee, conducted a year-long investigation, and concluded — quel surprise! — that no litigation was warranted.   But you can’t simply cite common sense in derivative litigation. If you file a demand futility suit, you have to be able to show that a majority of board members were incapable of independence. In most derivative suits, including the J&J case, shareholders argue that board members won’t take action because they’re worried about their own liability.   And to show that, as Judge Wolfson explains in her J&J ruling, plaintiffs lawyers have to meet what is often described as “possibly the most difficult theory in corporation law upon which a plaintiff might hope to win a judgment.”   Under the Delaware Chancery Court’s 1996 Caremark precedent, as restated in the 2009 In re Citigroup (C.N) case, shareholders have to show that corporate directors acted in bad faith, offering specific evidence that “(the board’s) indolence was so persistent that it could not be ascribed to anything other than a knowing decision not to even try to make sure the corporation’s officers had developed and were implementing a prudent approach to ensuring law compliance.”   Only an “utter failure to attempt to assure a reasonable information and reporting system exists” leads to board liability under the laws that govern Delaware-chartered corporations, which means most U.S. business.   So even a board like J&J’s, which presided over a company rife with problems so severe that it reached three criminal plea deals in a single year, is off the hook unless its shareholders can show individual directors had actual knowledge of corporate failures and deliberately chose to ignore them.   That’s the near-insurmountable standard Judge Wolfson found the plaintiffs failed to meet.   The judge did leave a tiny bit of opportunity for plaintiffs lawyers to revive their case. She suggested they could file a suit seeking J&J’s board records, then amend their derivative complaint to add specific allegations about which board members knew about J&J problems and when those problems were addressed at board meetings.   But Judge Wolfson didn’t hold out much hope that shareholders would be able to muster the necessary evidence. Moreover, she added an oblique warning.   Shareholders chose to litigate without corporate records the first time around, she said. So if they file an amended complaint, they may be stuck paying J&J’s legal bills for any “additional burden” imposed on the company by the second round of litigation.   That would be quite a message to send to shareholders. Try to hold your board responsible for corporate failures that have cost the company tens of millions of dollars, and you just might end up paying the lawyers who stood in the way.   J&J’s counsel, Walter Carlson of Sidley Austin, declined comment. Mark Lebovitch of Bernstein Litowitz was unavailable, and Darren Robbins of Robbins Geller didn’t respond to my e-mail.

173,JNJ,Zytiga creeps up on Provenge prostate-cancer drug,"* Quicker relief, ease of use help Zytiga pill * Zytiga’s fast ramp-up seen hurting Dendreon * Bavarian Nordic vaccine moving into Phase III trials By Ransdell Pierson NEW YORK, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Interest in Dendreon Corp’s Provenge vaccine to treat prostate cancer seems to be waning following recent approval of Johnson & Johnson’s  more-convenient and faster-acting Zytiga treatment, according to some doctors and industry analysts. “The bloom is off the rose for Provenge because patients are looking for something that can treat them more quickly,” and with greater convenience, said Charles Duncan, a biotechnology analyst for JMP Securities. Although Provenge extended patient lives by an average of about four months in clinical trials, it does not significantly delay progression of symptoms — including the bone pain which is a hallmark of advanced prostate cancer. Even so, hopes for Provenge were sky high when U.S. regulators approved it in April 2010 for patients with prostate cancer who had failed to benefit from standard medicines that work by blocking the body’s production of testosterone. Some analysts had expected the vaccine, which spurs the immune system to attack prostate cancer cells, to eventually capture annual sales of more than $4 billion. But Duncan, whose company helped sponsor the “Cancer Immunology: A Long-Awaited Reality” conference in New York on Thursday, said Provenge is likely to generate peak annual sales of no more than $500 million because of shortcomings that have become evident to patients and doctors. They include the time and inconvenience of extracting white blood cells from patients and sending them off to Dendreon plants, where they are combined with vaccine components. Patients then receive the final product through infusions. Dr. Susan Slovin, an oncologist with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said many patients and doctors are gravitating instead toward J&J;’s Zytiga — a pill approved in recent months for advanced prostate cancer patients that have failed to benefit from chemotherapy. The drug, known by its chemical name abiraterone, also prolonged life by about four months in clinical trials. But patients experience symptom relief far sooner with it than with Provenge, said Slovin, who was interviewed at the conference sponsored by strategy consulting firm MD Becker Partners LLC. “Abiraterone is taking the market by storm; there is a much faster effect with it” than Provenge, Slovin said. “Patients feel they’re getting something beneficial. Pain is markedly improved, along with the ability to eat, drink, go out and do what they normally would do.” “The patient says, ‘Look, I really don’t see the need to sit here and send my (blood) to wherever. I really don’t want to wait. I want to take a pill and go to Florida.’ “ Moreover, while Zytiga is expensive — at about $5,000 a month, usually for eight cycles — it is far less costly than Provenge. Dendreon stunned investors in August by withdrawing its own sales forecast for Provenge because it was taking longer than expected for doctors to become comfortable with reimbursement issues for the product, which costs $93,000 for a course of treatment. “I don’t think Provenge will fall out of the arena; I do think it will still be used, but not with the same alacrity as when it first hit our formulary,” said Slovin, whose hospital is one of the world’s most prestigious cancer centers. Dr. James Gulley, a director of clinical trials for the National Cancer Institute, said there is a “clear utility” for Provenge. “Patients love the idea that your immune system is helping you fight cancer,” he said. But Gulley said its manufacturing process poses challenges that have no doubt hampered demand for the product. “The vaccine has to be made for each individual patient.” Gulley is leading clinical trials of an experimental vaccine to treat prostate cancer that could be taken out of the freezer and injected into patients — eliminating the hassles seen with Provenge. The National Cancer Institute developed the vaccine, called ProstVac, and licensed it to Danish biotechnology company Bavarian Nordic . NCI would be entitled to royalties on sales of the vaccine, which is slated to move into late-stage trials in coming weeks. Gulley said ProstVac prolonged patient lives by eight months in mid-stage trials — roughly twice the benefit seen in separate trials of Provenge and Zytiga. But he cautioned that ProstVac’s true potential will not be known until its far-larger planned Phase III trials are completed. He said the vaccine, which coaxes immune system T-cells to attack a protein called Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) — could prove to be a bigger drug than Provenge. “Here’s why: because it is off the shelf. There are no logistical constraints.” Currently, the world’s top selling prostate cancer drugs are Taxotere (docetaxel), a chemotherapy sold by Sanofi , and drugs that reduce testosterone, the male hormone that fuels the growth of prostate cancer. They include AstraZeneca Plc’s Zoladex and Casodex, and widely-used Lupron. Prostate cancer kills about 250,000 men a year globally and is the second most common cause of cancer death in men in the United States, after lung cancer.

It would have risen just 2.6 percent if not for the weaker dollar, which boosts the value of sales in overseas markets. Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss said the results were not as impressive as they might appear because J&J;’s profit beat was due largely to income from divestitures and the company’s profit margins slipped during the quarter. “Results were in line, but not the sort of quality that people would have wanted,” Purkiss said. J&J; shares were down 0.3 percent at $63.63 in morning trading, in line with the drug sector. The company’s U.S. sales slipped 3.7 percent, hurt by declines in all three product segments: prescription drugs, consumer products and medical devices. But overseas, where the company generates most of its sales, revenue jumped 16.4 percent, with half of the gain attributable to foreign exchange factors. Global pharmaceutical revenue rose almost 9 percent to $5.98 billion, although U.S. sales shrank 6.1 percent as cheaper generics virtually eliminated demand for J&J;’s Levaquin antibiotic.

Sales of consumer products rose 4.9 percent to $3.74 billion, held back by plunging U.S. sales of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs that have been recalled over the past two years due to quality-control lapses. Combined U.S. sales of J&J;’S OTC brands and nutritional products fell almost 25 percent in the quarter, to $332 million.

180,JNJ,Health campaigners urge boycott of J&J; baby shampoo,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A coalition of health campaigners on Tuesday urged a boycott of Johnson & Johnson until it removes from its baby shampoo a preservative considered by the government to be a possible trigger for some cancers and skin allergies. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics said in a report that the health care company uses the preservative quaternium-15 in the Johnson’s Baby Shampoo line sold in the United States and elsewhere. Quaternium-15 is added to many cosmetic products to prevent spoiling and contamination, and the preservative works by releasing formaldehyde to kill bacteria. The Department of Health said formaldehyde is known to cause cancer, although exposure to it is difficult to avoid as it is widely used in some form in consumer products and traces of it are found in the air, particularly inside the home. Repeated exposure also can increase the risk of a person developing allergic skin reactions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. There are no restrictions on the use of formaldehyde-releasing preservatives in cosmetics. Responding to the report, Johnson & Johnson said it has been working on phasing out formaldehyde-releasing preservatives from its baby products since 2009, when the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics first raised its concerns with the company about its baby shampoo. “We know that some consumers are concerned about formaldehyde,” the company said in a statement, “which is why we offer many products without formaldehyde-releasing preservatives, and are phasing out these types of preservatives in our baby products worldwide.” It said its current formulations were nonetheless safe and met or exceeded safety regulations in every market where they are sold. “Clearly there is no need for Johnson & Johnson to expose babies to a known carcinogen when the company is already making safer alternatives,” Lisa Archer, director of the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics at the Breast Cancer Fund, said in a statement. The Campaign said the company is already making formaldehyde-free baby shampoo for sale in Japan, South Africa, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, among other countries. “All babies deserve safer products,” Archer said. Since the Campaign first raised its concerns, Johnson & Johnson has released a new line in the United States called Johnson’s Naturals, which does not contain formaldehyde-releasing preservatives. The company said it also is working to eliminate 1,4-dioxane, a contaminant also thought to be carcinogenic that is commonly found in shampoos and other cosmetics, from its products. The company said it has already reformulated 70 percent of its baby product lines to achieve this goal. Stacy Malkan, the author of the Campaign’s report, said she welcomed Johnson & Johnson’s commitment. “We’re really pleased to see them make a public stand, but we feel they need put a timeline to it,” she said. A spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson said it was not possible to say when its baby product lines would be entirely formaldehyde-free. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics describes itself as a coalition of more than 150 nonprofit organizations, including Clean Water Action, the Breast Cancer Fund, Environmental Working Group and Friends of the Earth.",11012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-babyshampoo/health-campaigners-urge-boycott-of-jj-baby-shampoo-idUSTRE7A06HN20111101

There are no restrictions on the use of formaldehyde-releasing preservatives in cosmetics. “Clearly there is no need for Johnson & Johnson to expose babies to a known carcinogen when the company is already making safer alternatives,” Lisa Archer, director of the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics at the Breast Cancer Fund, said in a statement. The Campaign said the company is already making formaldehyde-free baby shampoo for sale in Japan, South Africa, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, among other countries. “All babies deserve safer products,” Archer said. Since the Campaign first raised its concerns, Johnson & Johnson has released a new line in the United States called Johnson’s Naturals, which does not contain formaldehyde-releasing preservatives. The company said it also is working to eliminate 1,4-dioxane, a contaminant also thought to be carcinogenic that is commonly found in shampoos and other cosmetics, from its products. The company said it has already reformulated 70 percent of its baby product lines to achieve this goal. Still, Johnson & Johnson said its current formulations were safe and met or exceeded safety regulations in every market where they are sold. Stacy Malkan, the author of the Campaign’s report, said she welcomed Johnson & Johnson’s commitment. “We’re really pleased to see them make a public stand, but we feel they need put a timeline to it,” she said. A spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson said it was not possible to say when its baby product lines would be entirely formaldehyde-free. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics describes itself as a coalition of more than 150 nonprofit organizations, including Clean Water Action, the Breast Cancer Fund, Environmental Working Group and Friends of the Earth.",11012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-babyshampoo/health-campaigners-warn-against-jj-baby-shampoo-idUSN1E7A01DV20111101
182,JNJ,Boehringer says about 260 deaths related to Pradaxa,"FRANKFURT, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Boehringer Ingelheim said that 260 cases of fatal bleeding have been linked to its new stroke prevention pill Pradaxa so far, adding that the risk of death was still below the rate that emerged in the clinical trial that led to the drug’s approval. In early November, the German drugmaker had said that 50 reported deaths were a “reasonable order of magnitude”. The company on Saturday confirmed in a statement the new global number more than five times higher than the previous one, initially reported by magazines Der Spiegel and Die Zeit. Like other anti-blood-clotting treatments, Pradaxa’s benefit of cutting the rate of fatal or debilitating strokes comes at the risk of internal bleeding, which can also cost lives. Unlisted Boehringer also said there have been fewer cases of fatal side effects linked to Pradaxa than what would have been expected if they had been treated by the standard drug warfarin, which Boehringer is trying to replace. Warfarin has been used for decades but it is difficult to handle because it interacts with certain vegetables and requires frequent blood tests. Pradaxa, the first in a promising new class of medicines to overcome these drawbacks, is designed to prevent strokes in patients suffering from atrial fibrillation, a form of irregular heartbeat common among the elderly. Boehringer said in its statement that the risk of deadly bleeding linked to warfarin was more than 40 percent higher than that associated with Pradaxa, citing figures from the RE-LY study that led to the new pill’s approval. Still, some healthcare watchdogs’ attention has been heightened. European regulators last month said that patients about to take Pradaxa should have their kidneys checked, and Japanese regulators told Boehringer in August to issue a strong warning to doctors of potentially deadly bleeding as a result of use of Pradaxa. Rival anti-clotting drugs include Xarelto from Bayer  and Johnson & Johnson, Eliquis from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, and Daiichi Sankyo’s Lixiana. The are all vying for a market that analysts estimate at somewhere between $10 billion and $20 billion per year. Pradaxa won regulatory clearance in the United States for stroke prevention in October 2010, followed by other important markets this year. Bayer and Johnson & Johnson’s Xarelto could make major gains this weekend at the annual American Heart Association meeting in Orlando, where more clinical data is due to be release.",11122011,http://www.reuters.com/article/boehringer-pradaxa/boehringer-says-about-260-deaths-related-to-pradaxa-idUSL5E7MC09K20111112

184,JNJ,Bayer/J&J; anti-clot drug cuts death in heart study,"ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - Low doses of Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson’s Xarelto blood clot preventer cut the risk of death by more than 30 percent when used on top of standard blood thinners in patients with acute coronary syndrome, according to data from a study released on Sunday. The companies had previously revealed that Xarelto met the study’s main goal of significantly reducing the combined risk of death, stroke or heart attack when used on top of Plavix and aspirin compared with those standard medicines alone. In the Atlas study of 15,526 patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome (ACS), those who received Xarelto, known chemically as rivaroxaban, had a 16 percent combined reduced risk of death, stroke or heart attack, which researchers considered to be highly statistically significant. For the lowest of the two tested Xarelto doses — 2.5 milligrams twice a day — the risk of cardiovascular death was cut by 34 percent and all causes of death by 32 percent, according to data presented at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in Orlando. “The real kicker was mortality. It was just a highly significant response,” said Dr Eugene Braunwald, the study’s chairman from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said demonstrating a meaningful overall mortality benefit could translate into an additional $2 billion or $3 billion opportunity for the Bayer and J&J; medicine. As previously reported, Xarelto led to a significant increase in bleeding when used on top Plavix and aspirin, including intracranial hemorrhage. But there was no increase in fatal bleeding and researchers felt the increased bleeding risk was offset by the mortality reduction. “I’d rather have a major bleed and walk out of the hospital than not have a bleed and be wheeled to the morgue, so all cause mortality is the most important thing,” Braunwald said. There was also another benefit seen with the Xarelto group in patients who had previously received a stent in an artery clearing procedure — about 60 percent of study participants. Stent thrombosis, or reclogging of the treated artery, was reduced by 31 percent in patients taking the Bayer and J&J; pill. “This is a real difference on top of dual antiplatelet therapy,” Braunwald said. Xarelto, which inhibits a protein called factor Xa involved in the blood clotting process, is one of three new drugs vying for position in the multibillion-dollar anti-clot market along with axpixaban from Pfizer Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pradaxa from Boehringer Ingelheim. Apixaban previously failed in a similar study of ACS patients. Earlier this month, Xarelto won U.S. approval for preventing strokes in patients with a dangerously irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation, considered by far the largest and most lucrative use for the new generation of blood thinners. Researchers and company officials believe the data presented on Sunday are likely to be seen as strong enough for Xarelto to gain an additional approval to treat ACS — an umbrella term that refers to patients’ who have heart attacks or chest pain usually caused by a blocked coronary artery. “The results exceeded our expectations,” said Peter DiBattiste, J&J;’s head of cardiovascular and metabolism, adding that the companies plan to apply for U.S. and European approval for use in ACS patients by the end of the year. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine accompanying the data, while generally positive, somewhat tempered the enthusiasm, noting that only 9 percent of study subjects were at least 75 years old and more than 75 percent had normal kidney function. “The results may not be applicable to higher-risk patients with an acute coronary syndrome who are commonly treated in routine practice,” it said. About a million patients in the United States are hospitalized each year after having an ACS episode, usually a heart attack, researchers said. The majority of the patients in the study were already on Plavix and aspirin — the current standard of care — although about 7 percent were taking only aspirin. Study subjects were then given a placebo, 5 milligrams of Xarelto twice a day or 2.5 mg of Xarelto twice a day. “When we compared 2.5 with 5, the 2.5 was superior on efficacy and superior to 5 mg on safety,” Braunwald said.

189,JNJ,"Quick review of Eliquis could lift Bristol, Pfizer","* Analysts: good chance for speedy FDA review of clot drug * Priority review could suggest unique drug attributes * FDA, Bristol-Myers, Pfizer decline comment By Ransdell Pierson Nov 16 (Reuters) - Eliquis, a promising blood clot preventer from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, has a decent chance at getting an accelerated review by U.S. health regulators in coming months, industry analysts said. Bristol-Myers and Pfizer plan to submit their application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by year’s end. The experimental pill was shown in clinical trials to be safer and more effective than warfarin, a widely used oral anticoagulant, in preventing strokes among patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. The FDA typically takes 10 months or longer to review new drug applications, but could render a decision on Eliquis within six months under an expedited review. “That would be a major coup for the drug, from a Wall Street perspective,” said Barclays Capital analyst Tony Butler, who predicted shares of both Bristol-Myers and Pfizer could each rise as much as $1 on news of a so-called “priority review” of the drug. “The assumption would be that there’s something unique about this product, compared to drugs that are currently available in the marketplace” Butler said. Two other new blood-clot drugs, Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa, and Xarelto from Bayer and Johnson & Johnson , were recently approved in standard FDA reviews. They have shown benefits over warfarin but are not deemed safer in terms of overall bleeding risk. Neither of them has reduced overall risk of death as Eliquis has demonstrated. “Bristol-Myers and Pfizer will go for an expedited review if they can; I don’t think the other companies’ data were strong enough to even ask for one,” said Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss. The FDA, Bristol-Myers and Pfizer all declined to comment on the prospects of a priority review. Purkiss said a quicker review might elevate Eliquis in the minds of some cardiologists. But he cautioned that the FDA might be hard-pressed to complete its review so quickly given the volume of data from various clinical trials. Michael Liss, portfolio manager of American Century Investments, said he thinks there is a 50/50 chance the FDA will grant an expedited review. “It’s a flip of the coin.” Bristol-Myers and Pfizer shares would get a small bump — of maybe one percent — in the event of an expedited review because the shares have outperformed this year, he said. Bristol Myers shares, now trading in the $31 range, have jumped 17 percent this year, bolstered by high hopes for Eliquis and other new drugs, including its Yervoy treatment for melanoma. Pfizer shares, now in the $20 range, have risen 12 percent, compared with an overall average gain of about 3 percent for large U.S. and European drugmakers. The FDA in late 2010 approved Pradaxa, which works by directly blocking thrombin, a protein involved in the clotting process. The agency earlier this month approved Xarelto which, like Eliquis, blocks a protein called Factor Xa. Wall Street is expecting the three new drugs to capture combined sales of more than $10 billion in coming years, a boon for an industry suffering from generic competition and efforts by insurers to keep a lid on drug prices. Dr. Jeffrey Berger, who heads treatment and prevention of cardiovascular blood clots at New York University Langone Medical Center, said the data for Eliquis are “compelling.” But he said Eliquis cannot yet be considered the superior drug for preventing strokes because no trials have been done to compare it, Xarelto and Pradaxa with each other. “All three drugs have significant advantages compared with warfarin,” he said, arguing that the FDA should take its time on the Eliquis review if it needs to. “We have to tread a little slowly because it’s important for regulatory agencies to adequately understand the benefit and risks and to help educate the public on the different mechanisms and different effects of different drugs,” Berger said. More than 2 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat that causes blood to pool in the heart and form clots that can cause strokes. Many patients are unwilling or unable to take warfarin because of dietary requirements, bleeding risk, conflicts with other medicines and the need for regular testing to assure the right concentrations of warfarin are in their bloodstream.",11162011,http://www.reuters.com/article/drugs-eliquis/quick-review-of-eliquis-could-lift-bristol-pfizer-idUSN1E7AF1TU20111116
190,JNJ,CORRECTED - J&J; to nix baby-product contaminant within 2 years,"* To remove chemical from hundreds of baby products * CEO says chemical exposure safe as eating apple or pear * Says pushing ahead with removal of second contaminant By Ransdell Pierson Nov 16 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson, responding to complaints about a potentially carcinogenic chemical in its baby shampoos, said it plans within two years to eliminate formaldehyde-releasing preservatives from hundreds of its baby products. In a letter written on behalf of Chief Executive William Weldon, J&J; addressed concerns raised by the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics, a consumer group which earlier this month urged the healthcare company to remove from its baby shampoo a preservative called quaternium-15. The chemical is considered by the government to be a possible trigger for some cancers and skin allergies.  It is added to many cosmetic products to prevent spoiling and contamination, and works by releasing formaldehyde to kill bacteria. J&J; previously said it had been phasing out formaldehyde-releasing preservatives from its baby products since 2009, when the Campaign for Safe Cosmetics first raised its concerns with the company about its baby shampoo. But in its letter to the group, written by vice president of product stewardship and toxicology Susan Nettesheim, J&J; provided a more concrete timetable. It said it has begun providing “alternatives to formaldehyde-releasing preservatives and expect(s) to finish this process in our hundreds of baby products around the world within about two years, and sooner for our baby shampoos.” J&J; said the company is making the effort even though the trace amounts of formaldehyde exposure pose little risk. Nettesheim said an entire bottle of baby shampoo creates exposures to formaldehyde equivalent to the amount a person would encounter “by eating an apple or pear, in which it occurs naturally.” J&J; said the company also continues to make progress in reducing trace amounts in its products of 1,4-dioxane, a contaminant also thought to be carcinogenic that is commonly found in shampoos and other cosmetics. J&J; did not provide a timetable for that goal, but said most company products already meet the company standard. J&J;, which also makes Band-Aids, medical devices and an array of prescription drugs, in the past two years has recalled hundreds of thousands of packages of over-the-counter medicines — including painkillers Tylenol and Motrin — due to quality-control lapses. Weldon has taken responsibility for the rash of recalls, which have harmed the company’s image and hurt its sales and earnings since late 2009. Under supervision from the U.S. government, J&J; is revamping its factories to correct the problems, and is gradually restoring the recalled consumer medicines to drugstores.",11172011,http://www.reuters.com/article/johnsonandjohnson/corrected-jj-to-nix-baby-product-contaminant-within-2-years-idUSN1E7AF21020111117

The final draft guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) comes just six months after Eliquis was licensed in Europe, marking an unusually rapid decision by the agency that determines which drugs are paid for on the state health service. Eliquis will compete in the post-surgery setting with established injectable anti-coagulants, such as Sanofi’s  Lovenox, as well as other new oral anti-coagulants like Bayer and Johnson & Johnson’s Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa. These other drugs are also recommended by NICE for use after hip and knee replacement procedures. However, the really big commercial opportunity for new anti-clotting pills lies in their long-term use for preventing strokes in patients with irregular heartbeats. So far, only Pradaxa has been approved in this setting in Europe, although Xarelto was recommended for approval in September. NICE said the cost of Eliquis treatment was estimated to be 41.16 pounds ($63.82) for knee replacement surgery, based on 12 days of treatment, and 116.62 pounds for hip replacement, based on 34 days.",11252011,http://www.reuters.com/article/bristol-pfizer-britain/uk-cost-agency-backs-bms-pfizer-anti-clot-drug-idUSL5E7MO29C20111125
196,JNJ,"Bristol-Myers, J&J; team up against hepatitis C","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Johnson & Johnson plan to jointly develop experimental treatments for hepatitis C in a market worth billions of dollars. The drugs being developed by the two companies work by blocking different proteins than those attacked by traditional treatments for the serious liver disease, which is caused by infection with the hepatitis C virus. Bristol-Myers said on Friday its drugs daclatasir (BMS-790052) and its NS5A replication complex inhibitor would be tested in combination with a NS3 protease inhibitor called TMC435 being developed by J&J;’s Tibotec pharmaceuticals unit. Beginning in the first half of 2012, the medicines will be tested in various combinations in patients with genotype 1, the most common and most difficult-to-treat viral strain of hepatitis C. J&J; currently has the European rights to distribute Incivo (telaprevir), one of the most promising new hepatitis C treatments on the market. The recently approved drug, which can nearly double prior cure rates, was developed and is sold in the United States by Vertex Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Incivek. Any drug that comes out of the Bristol/J&J; collaboration would likely be a rival to the Vertex medicine, which is taken in combination with the older drugs ribavirin and pegylated interferon. Several companies are racing to develop hepatitis C treatment regimens that do not include interferon, which causes severe flu-like symptoms and leads many patients to discontinue or avoid treatment. Pharmasset Inc, which is being acquired by Gilead Sciences Inc and Abbott Laboratories, are among the companies developing promising all oral, interferon-free treatments for hepatitis C, a market some analysts have said could be worth $20 billion by 2020.

201,JNJ,FDA says J&J; halted Doribax trial due to safety issues,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson shut down a clinical trial of its antibiotic Doribax for a type of pneumonia after patients taking the drug had higher rates of death and a lower cure rate than those who got an alternative medicine, U.S. health regulators said on Thursday. Doribax is currently approved in the United States to treat adults with complicated urinary tract or abdominal infections but not for any type of pneumonia, the Food and Drug Administration said. In a clinical trial testing Doribax on patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, those who received the drug had a 6.7 percent higher rate of death from any cause than patients getting an alternative. Patients taking Doribax also had a 11.2 percent lower rate of being cured than patients getting imipenem-cilastatin, the generic version of Merck & Co Inc’s Primaxin. Doribax, known generically as doripenem, is approved for hospital-acquired pneumonia in Europe, and the trial was conducted as part of a post-marketing requirement from the European Medicines Agency, said Shaun Mickus, spokesman at Janssen, the J&J; unit that markets the drug. Japanese drugmaker Shionogi & Co manufactures Doribax. Mickus said the trial had study sites in several countries, including the United States. The trial was halted in May 2011 based on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee, and the company finished analyzing the results recently. In the halted trial, the 28-day all cause mortality rate was 21.5 percent for those who received Doribax compared with 14.8 percent in the control group. Mickus said Doribax was still safe and effective for its approved uses in the United States. In June 2007, Johnson & Johnson applied for U.S. approval of Doribax for the treatment of pneumonia acquired in the hospital, known as nosocomial pneumonia, which includes ventilator-associated pneumonia. The FDA asked the company for more information in August 2008, and Mickus said the company had resubmitted its application and was still in discussions with the agency.

208,JNJ,UK says home-grown cancer pill too costly to use,"* NICE draft guidance finds Zytiga too expensive for NHS * Prostate cancer drug discovered in UK, now sold by J&J; * Cancer groups say decision bad for patients and research By Ben Hirschler LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Britain’s health cost watchdog NICE sparked a major row on Thursday by snubbing a pricey new prostate cancer pill discovered at the country’s top cancer research centre, a decision critics said was bad for patients and research. If the draft ruling is upheld after further consultation, Zytiga, which is marketed by Johnson & Johnson, will not be reimbursed on the state-run National Health Service (NHS). The drug was hailed as a significant advance by cancer doctors after a clinical trial showed it extended the lives of patients with advanced prostate cancer by an average of 3.9 months. Unlike many cancer medicines, it can be taken at home. It was quickly approved by U.S. and European regulators last year, but Britain’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) said it did not provide enough benefit to justify the high cost, even with a discount offered by J&J.; Zytiga, also known as abiraterone, is taken once a day as a single dose of four tablets and costs 2,930 pounds ($4,600) for a 30-day supply. J&J; has offered a discount, the size of which is confidential, and it is possible that further haggling might produce an acceptable pricing deal — but leading cancer charities are alarmed by the impasse. The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), whose scientists discovered the medicine, said it hoped NICE would now work with J&J; to find a solution. Cancer Research UK, which supported research into Zytiga with the Medical Research Council and BTG before rights to the drug were finally acquired by J&J;, also questioned the grounds of the NICE verdict, which it said made “no sense”. “Generous public donations to Cancer Research UK and other organisations paid for the initial development of the drug and we feel extremely let down,” said Harpal Kumar, the charity’s chief executive. It is the first time since 2008 that Cancer Research UK has publicly criticised a ruling from NICE, whose decisions on whether or not drugs should be used on the NHS are often controversial. Worldwide sales of Zytiga are expected to reach $1.6 billion a year by 2015, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Pharma. British charities will receive royalties on those sales, which will be reinvested in further research. The drug works by decreasing production of testosterone that would stimulate cancer cells to continue growing. It is designed for use in combination with the steroid prednisone in patients with late-stage castration-resistant prostate cancer who have received prior chemotherapy treatment. Johann de Bono from the ICR told a conference in Milan in 2010 the survival gain it offered compared favourably with that seen with Roche’s Herceptin in breast cancer. The NICE decision means British men could be left without the chance to benefit from “one of the biggest breakthroughs in the treatment of the disease for many years”, according to Owen Sharp, chief executive of the Prostate Cancer Charity.

209,JNJ,J&J; tries to ease EU concerns on Synthes buy,"BRUSSELS, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson  has sought to ease EU concerns that its planned $21.3 billion purchase of Swiss medical devices maker Synthes could stifle competition, the European Commission said on Tuesday. The companies presented their arguments before competition officials and lawyers from the Commission as well as representatives from national antitrust agencies on Monday. “An oral hearing took place yesterday in the Synthes/Johnson & Johnson case,” said Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for competition affairs at the Commission. EU regulators typically send a statement of objections laying out their concerns about the impact of a merger on rivals and consumers to companies about two and a half weeks before oral hearings. The Commission opened an in-depth investigation into the deal in November last year, saying it wanted to make sure that rivals would still be able to compete effectively once the takeover is completed. The companies can offer concessions to address the regulatory concerns, which would lead the Commission to extend its April 2 deadline by 15 working days. The acquisition, the largest for J&J;, would make it the world leader in the orthopedic reconstruction market.",2142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/jj-synthes-eu/jj-tries-to-ease-eu-concerns-on-synthes-buy-idUSL5E8DE7ZI20120214

212,JNJ,UPDATE 1-J&J; recalls infant Tylenol due to bottle flaw,"* Company removing entire US supply of 574,000 bottles * J&J; not certain when will return with infant Tylenol * No adverse events reported with product * J&J; has issued series of recalls * Shares nearly unchanged By Lewis Krauskopf Feb 17 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said it was recalling its entire U.S. supply of infant Tylenol after parents complained about problems with a new dosing system, the latest in a string of recalls for the healthcare giant. Friday’s recall involves about 574,000 bottles of the grape-flavored liquid Tylenol for infants younger than 2 years old. Following earlier recalls, J&J; had just returned to the market with the infant Tylenol in November, but now will be out of the market for an indefinite time. The problems involves a new bottle design, which was intended to prevent accidental ingestion and ensure accurate dosing. But when parents inserted a syringe into the bottle, some accidentally pushed a protective cover inside. To date, J&J; has received 17 complaints, company spokeswoman Bonnie Jacobs said. No serious side effects from the infant Tylenol have been reported, and the risk of such problems are “remote,” J&J; said. The recall is from stores and wholesalers; consumers can still use the product provided that the protective cover at the top of the bottle remains in place, J&J; said. The recall does not affect Tylenol for children 2 years and older, for which J&J; also introduced a new but different design. The company had said last summer that it was planning to return its products to the markets with the improved designs. J&J; spokeswoman Jacobs said the company did not have a specific date for when it would return to the market with infant Tylenol. “We are looking for various alternatives for the redesign,” Jacobs said. “Once we have reviewed those options, we will set a timeline for the product to return.” The product was manufactured to specifications, so the company is investigating why it was not performing as expected, Jacobs said. Jacobs said the company would only make note of a financial impact from the recall when it reports quarterly results, but that infant Tylenol was a “relatively modest” portion of overall sales. The recall is the latest in a long series for J&J;, including not only popular consumer medicine brands such as Tylenol, but also artificial hips and contact lenses. The infant Tylenol product was manufactured at a plant in Latina, Italy. Last March, U.S. health authorities took over supervision of three other J&J; manufacturing plants after the flood of recalls. Shares of J&J; were up 1 cent at $64.93 in morning trading.",2172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/johnsonandjohnson/update-1-jj-recalls-infant-tylenol-due-to-bottle-flaw-idUSL2E8DH2XY20120217

214,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson CEO Weldon to step down in April,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson Chief Executive William Weldon will step down from his post in April after a series of recalls called into question the quality of the healthcare giant’s products, from artificial hips to infant Tylenol. Weldon, 63, will remain chairman, the company said on Tuesday. He has held both roles for nearly 10 years, after three decades spent working his way through the company from his first job as a sales representative at J&J;’s McNeil consumer division. Vice Chairman Alex Gorsky, 51, will become CEO as of the next board meeting on April 26, making him the ninth person to lead the company since J&J;’s founding in 1886. Under Weldon’s tenure, J&J; expanded a sprawling business comprising more than 250 companies, from prescription drugmakers to a medical devices division and units that make personal care products. In the past two years, the company that long prided itself on a credo of high quality has seen its reputation tarnished by massive recalls for products that were poorly manufactured or failed at a higher-than-expected rate. “Gorsky is inheriting a company with a better pharmaceutical pipeline than it had 5 or 6 years ago,” Morgan, Keegan & Co analyst Jan Wald said. “He is inheriting a consumer division that’s still embroiled in problems and he is getting a medical device business that he needs to refresh and restructure and get it to grow again.” “He’s got a lot of work to do and it is going to be very hard to affect anything in the short-term,” Wald said. The quality control problems at J&J;’s McNeil consumer healthcare unit — which makes over-the-counter medicines like painkillers Tylenol and Motrin — were deemed so pervasive that U.S. health regulators took over supervision of three manufacturing plants in March. Last month, the company said it would take a $3 billion charge, mostly to cover costs for its recall of metal artificial hips by its DePuy Orthopedics unit. The latest trouble came just last Friday, when J&J; recalled the entire U.S. supply — 574,000 bottles — of its infant Tylenol soon after the product had returned to pharmacy shelves. Weldon was called before Congress in late 2010 to address the recalls, including an incident in which J&J; hired contractors to pose as customers and buy defective bottles of Motrin at drugstores rather than alert the general public. “This was not one of our finer moments,” Weldon said at the time. TWO-WAY RACE Gorsky is the latest in a long line of CEOs to come from within the company, although he left in 2004 for a four-year stint as Novartis’ head of pharmaceuticals in North America before returning to J&J.; Gorsky began his J&J; career in 1988 as a sales representative with the Janssen Pharmaceutica unit. In 2001, he was appointed president of Janssen, and in 2003, Gorsky became group chairman of Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceuticals business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. After returning to the J&J; fold he became global chairman of the Surgical Care Group. Investors had expected Weldon would be succeeded by Gorsky or co-Vice Chairman Sheri McCoy, who were promoted to the shared post in December 2010. McCoy will report to Gorsky and continue to lead the company’s pharmaceuticals and consumer groups. J&J;’s planned $21 billion purchase of Swiss medical device maker Synthes, its largest ever, may have helped tip the decision in Gorsky’s favor, some said. “Medical devices has now become their biggest division by sales and earnings and is going to be even bigger when the Synthes deal closes, and that’s obviously Alex Gorsky’s background,” said Jeff Jonas, co-portfolio manager for the Gabelli Healthcare and Wellness Trust, which holds J&J; stock. Jonas said he’d like to see J&J; buy back more of its stock going forward, a move not likely before the company closes on the Synthes deal. J&J; shares were nearly unchanged after the announcement. He noted that J&J; has new promise with a pipeline of medicines including blood clot preventer Xarelto, developed with Bayer AG, and prostate cancer drug Zytiga. “He’s done a good job for most of the business but obviously the consumer business is sort of a big black eye,” Jonas said of Weldon. “He chose good managers.” ",2212012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnsonjohnson/johnson-johnson-ceo-weldon-to-step-down-in-april-idUSTRE81K1YO20120221

217,JNJ,Supreme Court won't review J&J-Abbott; patent case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to review a ruling that Abbott Laboratories’ Humira arthritis drug did not infringe a patent owned by a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary and that threw out a $1.67 billion damage award against Abbott. The justices refused to hear an appeal by the J&J; unit — Janssen Biotech, previously known as Centocor Ortho Biotech — of the ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appeals court ruled the patent claims asserted by the J&J; unit were invalid and the patent thus could not be infringed. It overturned the award of $1.67 billion by a jury in 2009 in federal court in Texas for lost profits and damages. The case involved Humira, Abbott’s drug that blocks tumor necrosis factor and competes with Johnson & Johnson’s older blockbuster medication Remicade. The lawsuit was filed in 2007. In appealing to the Supreme Court, attorneys for the J&J; unit said the Patent Act requires a written description of the invention. It said the appeals court had read the mandate incorrectly, in a way that went beyond disclosing the invention and enabled others to make and use it. It said the appeals court had enforced a “burdensome” and “heightened standard” on biotechnology patents and that the question was of “pressing importance.” Attorneys for Abbott opposed the appeal, saying the appeals court correctly decided the issue and that further Supreme Court review was unwarranted. The Supreme Court case is Janssen Biotech v. Abbott Laboratories, No 11-596.

220,JNJ,J&J; offers EU concessions for Synthes buy,"BRUSSELS, Feb 22 (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson has offered concessions in a bid to ease EU regulatory concerns over its $21.3 billion purchase of Swiss medical device maker Synthes Inc, the European Commission said on Wednesday. The Commission, the competition regulator for the 27-country European Union, said it would decide on the deal by April 26 as it extended its deadline by 10 working days to assess the concessions. J&J;, which is buying Synthes to boost its orthopaedics franchise in its largest ever acquisition, submitted its concessions on Wednesday. Some analysts have said J&J; may have to divest some trauma assets to win regulatory approval. Medical devices and diagnostics made up 40 percent of its 2010 sales. Rivals in the sector include Stryker and Zimmer. Companies can either offer to sell off assets or agree to licensing deals to offset possible anti-competitive effects from mergers or acquisitions.",2222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/jj-synthes-eu/jj-offers-eu-concessions-for-synthes-buy-idUSL5E8DM51620120222
221,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson CEO Weldon to step down in April,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson Chief Executive William Weldon will step down from his post in April after a series of recalls called into question the quality of the healthcare giant’s products, from artificial hips to infant Tylenol. Weldon, 63, will remain chairman, the company said on Tuesday. He has held both roles for nearly 10 years, after three decades spent working his way through the company from his first job as a sales representative at J&J;’s McNeil consumer division. Vice Chairman Alex Gorsky, 51, will become CEO at the next board meeting on April 26, making him the ninth person to lead the company since J&J;’s founding in 1886. Under Weldon’s tenure, J&J; expanded a sprawling business comprising more than 250 companies, from prescription drugmakers to a medical devices division and units that make personal care products. J&J; shares are up less than 2 percent since Weldon took over a decade ago, but have recovered about 14 percent since August 2010 when the company was mired in product recalls. In the past two years, the company that long prided itself on a credo of high quality has seen its reputation tarnished by massive recalls for products that were poorly manufactured or failed at a higher-than-expected rate. “Gorsky is inheriting a company with a better pharmaceutical pipeline than it had 5 or 6 years ago,” Morgan, Keegan & Co analyst Jan Wald said. “He is inheriting a consumer division that’s still embroiled in problems and he is getting a medical device business that he needs to refresh and restructure and get it to grow again.” “He’s got a lot of work to do and it is going to be very hard to affect anything in the short-term,” Wald said. The quality control problems at J&J;’s McNeil consumer healthcare unit — which makes over-the-counter medicines like painkillers Tylenol and Motrin — were deemed so pervasive that U.S. health regulators took over supervision of three manufacturing plants in March. Under a consent decree that the McNeil unit was forced to enter into, the U.S. government will oversee those errant plants for at least five years, an independent expert was retained to inspect manufacturing facilities and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration can levy fines up to $10 million annually if it feels the agreement has been violated. The consumer products recalls cost the company nearly $1 billion in 2010 sales. Last month, the company said it would take a $3 billion charge, mostly to cover costs for its recall of metal artificial hips by its DePuy Orthopedics unit. The company also had to recall contact lenses, heart devices, such as stents, and insulin pump cartridges. The latest trouble came just last Friday, when J&J; recalled the entire U.S. supply — 574,000 bottles — of its infant Tylenol soon after the product had returned to pharmacy shelves. Weldon was called before Congress in late 2010 to address the recalls, including an incident in which J&J; hired contractors to pose as customers and buy defective bottles of Motrin at drugstores rather than alert the general public. “This was not one of our finer moments,” Weldon said at the time. TWO-WAY RACE Gorsky is the latest in a long line of CEOs to come from within the company, although he left in 2004 for a four-year stint as Novartis’ head of pharmaceuticals in North America before returning to J&J.; “Any time you change the hand at the tiller, it’s liable to liven things up a bit,” said Piper Jaffray analyst Matt Miksic. Miksic said he does not expect to see great rapid changes, but added, “resolution of the succession question and an energized new CEO rising to the challenge is a good thing for the company.” Gorsky began his J&J; career in 1988 as a sales representative with the Janssen Pharmaceutica unit. In 2001, he was appointed president of Janssen, and in 2003, Gorsky became group chairman of Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceuticals business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. After returning to the J&J; fold he became global chairman of the Surgical Care Group. Investors had expected Weldon would be succeeded by Gorsky or co-Vice Chairman Sheri McCoy, who were promoted to the shared post in December 2010. McCoy will report to Gorsky and continue to lead the company’s pharmaceuticals and consumer groups. J&J;’s planned $21 billion purchase of Swiss medical device maker Synthes, its largest ever, may have helped tip the decision in Gorsky’s favor, some said. “Medical devices has now become their biggest division by sales and earnings and is going to be even bigger when the Synthes deal closes, and that’s obviously Alex Gorsky’s background,” said Jeff Jonas, co-portfolio manager for the Gabelli Healthcare and Wellness Trust, which holds J&J; stock. Jonas said he’d like to see J&J; buy back more of its stock going forward, a move not likely before the company closes on the Synthes deal. J&J; shares were nearly unchanged after the announcement. He noted that J&J; has new promise with a pipeline of medicines including blood clot preventer Xarelto, developed with Bayer AG, and prostate cancer drug Zytiga. “He’s done a good job for most of the business but obviously the consumer business is sort of a big black eye,” Jonas said of Weldon. “He chose good managers.” ",2222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnsonjohnson/johnson-johnson-ceo-weldon-to-step-down-in-april-idUSTRE81K1YO20120222

225,JNJ,"New J&J; CEO must fix sullied image, integrate Synthes","CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) new CEO will need to take bold steps to help the giant healthcare company repair its reputation following costly product recalls and oversee its biggest acquisition ever. Alex Gorsky, 51, vice chairman of the Medical Device and Diagnostics Group, rose through the ranks of J&J; from his start as a salesman in 1988. He will be J&J;’s ninth top executive, all of them chosen from inside the company. Some investors say his expertise in medical devices helped secure the top job, but question whether yet another top executive groomed within the 125-year-old company’s ranks will be able to make needed changes. “It will help to bring someone in for a fresh start,” said David Heupel, portfolio manager at Thrivent Investment Management, which owns J&J; shares. “I’m not sure it’ll make a vast difference, but a new face probably will be viewed favorably.” Gorsky will take the helm in April at a critical time for J&J; as it tries to rectify a series of massive, embarrassing recalls of products ranging from artificial hips to infant Tylenol. No less of a challenge would be integrating the company’s planned $23.1 billion purchase of Swiss medical device maker Synthes Inc SYST.VX. Chris Velis, chairman and CEO of Medical Capital Group, which invests in medical technology ventures, noted J&J;’s lackluster stock performance — the shares have risen less than 2 percent during outgoing Chief Executive Officer William Weldon’s 10-year tenure — and said Gorsky should make some material changes. “He needs to send a clear message and develop a strategy and explain where he is going to take the company,” Velis said. One of the most pressing changes would be to centralize quality control at the nearly 250 companies under the J&J; umbrella. Gorsky also needs to get cutting-edge medical technology into the company, whether through internal development or acquisition, Velis said. “A large division of that organization is going to be threatened by new technology on a routine basis. Take the potential merger of Synthes — they are buying a tremendous amount of scale, but neither company has been successful at bringing cutting-edge technology to the market,” he said. A J&J; spokesman declined to make Gorsky available or address investor comment. Gorsky will become CEO on April 26, which coincides with a deadline for European regulators to decide on the Synthes deal. “He has to execute well on Synthes. It’s going to be a fairly complex integration because Synthes sells a lot of its products direct, training people right in the operating room sometimes,” said Gabelli & Co analyst Jeff Jonas, whose firm holds J&J; shares for its clients. He noted that it is expensive and complicated to sell products both directly, as Synthes does, and through distributors, as J&J; does. “It’s difficult to balance the two. You want one (sales) channel. Otherwise, it’s disruptive,” Jonas said. Synthes makes artificial spinal disc implants and other products used in spine surgery, as well as plates, screws and rods used to repair the bones of trauma patients. The company generated sales of $4 billion last year, and its addition would give J&J;’s Medical Devices and Diagnostic unit, already the biggest in the world, an even larger profile internally. J&J;’s medical device sales totaled $25.8 billion in 2011, but growth has flattened out in recent years, partly due to the company’s own problems with recalls and partly due to weak overall market conditions which saw a sharp cutback in medical procedures. Prescription drug sales were $24.4 billion last year and consumer products sales were $14.9 billion. Analysts said J&J; may need to divest part of Synthes’ spine business to get the deal approved. Gorsky’s medical device challenge also includes getting the DePuy Orthopedics unit back on track after its costly recalls of metal-on-metal hips. The company last month said it would take a $3 billion charge, largely related to that recall. “It will be a significant challenge, especially when integrating Synthes at the same time,” Jonas said. “They have to stay focused on M&A; activity, which they have done historically.” He suggested possible acquisitions of heart-imaging systems and devices that use energy to treat atrial fibrillation, a common heart arrhythmia, as well as balloon and stent technology to treat clogged arteries in the legs and neck. The quality control problems at J&J;’s McNeil consumer healthcare unit — which makes over-the-counter medicines like painkillers Tylenol and Motrin — were deemed so pervasive that U.S. health regulators took over supervision of three manufacturing plants in March. Under a consent decree, the U.S. government will oversee errant McNeil plants for at least five years, an independent expert was retained to inspect manufacturing facilities and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could levy fines up to $10 million annually should it feel the agreement has been violated. The consumer products recalls cost the company nearly $1 billion in 2010 sales. “They have to snuff this out quickly and get aggressive and get to the heart of the problem,” said Chuck Lauber, a portfolio manager at Tributary Capital Management, which sold its J&J; stake when the manufacturing issues emerged. J&J; shares have barely budged since Gorsky’s appointment was announced earlier this week, itself an indicator that few expect any big moves from his leadership. “I’d be surprised if he made any radical changes,” said Les Funtleyder of Miller Tabak & Co, which owns J&J; shares. “Gorsky was an Army Ranger, so he could kill you with his bare hands, but I’m not sure there’s anything special about him, other than he’s been there for a long time.” ",2242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jj-ceo/new-jj-ceo-must-fix-sullied-image-integrate-synthes-idUSTRE81N1S220120224
226,JNJ,"New J&J; CEO must fix sullied image, integrate Synthes","* Gorsky takes helm as fate of Synthes deal comes down * Investors say medical device expertise helped land the job * Some seek bold moves, but doubt Gorsky will make them By Debra Sherman and Ransdell Pierson CHICAGO/NEW YORK, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s new CEO will need to take bold steps to help the giant healthcare company repair its reputation following costly product recalls and oversee its biggest acquisition ever. Alex Gorsky, 51, vice chairman of the Medical Device and Diagnostics Group, rose through the ranks of J&J; from his start as a salesman in 1988. He will be J&J;’s ninth top executive, all of them chosen from inside the company. Some investors say his expertise in medical devices helped secure the top job, but question whether yet another top executive groomed within the 125-year-old company’s ranks will be able to make needed changes. “It will help to bring someone in for a fresh start,” said David Heupel, portfolio manager at Thrivent Investment Management, which owns J&J; shares. “I’m not sure it’ll make a vast difference, but a new face probably will be viewed favorably.” Gorsky will take the helm in April at a critical time for J&J; as it tries to rectify a series of massive, embarrassing recalls of products ranging from artificial hips to infant Tylenol. No less of a challenge would be integrating the company’s planned $23.1 billion purchase of Swiss medical device maker Synthes Inc. Chris Velis, chairman and CEO of Medical Capital Group, which invests in medical technology ventures, noted J&J;’s lackluster stock performance — the shares have risen less than 2 percent during outgoing Chief Executive Officer William Weldon’s 10-year tenure — and said Gorsky should make some material changes. “He needs to send a clear message and develop a strategy and explain where he is going to take the company,” Velis said. One of the most pressing changes would be to centralize quality control at the nearly 250 companies under the J&J; umbrella. Gorsky also needs to get cutting-edge medical technology into the company, whether through internal development or acquisition, Velis said. “A large division of that organization is going to be threatened by new technology on a routine basis. Take the potential merger of Synthes — they are buying a tremendous amount of scale, but neither company has been successful at bringing cutting-edge technology to the market,” he said. A J&J; spokesman declined to make Gorsky available or address investor comment. Gorsky will become CEO on April 26, which coincides with a deadline for European regulators to decide on the Synthes deal. “He has to execute well on Synthes. It’s going to be a fairly complex integration because Synthes sells a lot of its products direct, training people right in the operating room sometimes,” said Gabelli & Co analyst Jeff Jonas, whose firm holds J&J; shares for its clients. He noted that it is expensive and complicated to sell products both directly, as Synthes does, and through distributors, as J&J; does. “It’s difficult to balance the two. You want one (sales) channel. Otherwise, it’s disruptive,” Jonas said. Synthes makes artificial spinal disc implants and other products used in spine surgery, as well as plates, screws and rods used to repair the bones of trauma patients.

With priority review status the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will decide whether to approve the drug for that use within six months, rather than the usual 10- to 12-month review period. The agency grants priority review to products considered to be potentially significant therapeutic advancements over existing therapies. That would mean an FDA decision is likely to come in late June. The companies said they submitted the application for a third use for Xarelto on Dec. 29. Xarelto, known chemically as rivaroxaban, is already approved to help reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in patients suffering from an irregular heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation and to prevent blood clots in patients who had undergone hip or knee replacements. In a pivotal clinical trial presented in November, low doses of Xarelto cut the risk of death by more than 30 percent when used on top of standard blood thinners in ACS patients. ACS occurs when a coronary artery in blocked, reducing blood flow to the heart, often leading to a heart attack or chest pain.",2272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/jj-xarelto/update-1-bayer-jj-clot-drug-to-get-fast-fda-review-for-acs-idUSL4E8DRAC420120227

Martin, a former executive at investment bank Merrill Lynch, said in 2010 he would stand down from the Dublin-based biotechnology company in May this year and said last October the search for his successor was well under way. However he agreed to extend his tenure until the publication of Phase III data on Bapineuzumab, an experimental treatment being developed by Pfizer Inc and Johnson & Johnson  in which Elan has a 25 percent economic interest. “The full board and I believe that Elan and our shareholders will be best served by having Kelly continue his leadership through this critical period and strategic inflection point in the company’s progression,” Elan Chairman Robert Ingram said in a statement on Thursday. “The implications of the upcoming completion of the pivotal trials is potentially of transformational significance for Elan.” Bapineuzumab, which is competing with Eli Lilly and Co’s  solanezumab, is being promoted as the first to slow progression of Alzheimer’s, a disease that affects more than 35 million people worldwide. Ahead of plans to release the Phase III data in the second half of this year, Pfizer Inc’s research chief said last month the drug presents the industry’s best chance to delay progression of of the memory-robbing illness. Elan discovered the approach to the drug and oversaw early trials but sold its other 25 percent stake in the drug to Johnson & Johnson in 2009 as part of deal that saw the U.S. group also take an 18 percent stake in the group as a whole. Elan said it would maintain dialogue with what it described as a number of exceptionally high caliber succession candidates who remain interested in the position and support the decision.",3012012,http://www.reuters.com/article/elan/refile-update-1-elan-asks-ceo-to-stay-on-until-end-of-key-trial-idUSL5E8E10NV20120301

Synthes’ manufacturing issues come after Johnson & Johnson had its own series of high-profile product recalls and quality control problems with products such as infant Tylenol and artificial hips. In the letter dated Feb. 16, the agency said Synthes failed to report serious complaints about its devices to the FDA within 30 days, as required by law. “Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the Food and Drug Administration without further notice,” Kirk Sooter, director of the FDA’s Philadelphia district office, wrote in the letter. “We will co-operate and work diligently with the FDA until these deficiencies are fully resolved,” Synthes spokesman Gilgian Eisner said in an email.

243,JNJ,J&J; CEO Weldon retirement pay seen at $143.5 mln,"March 14 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s  outgoing CEO William Weldon could receive more than $140 million when he leaves the company, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday. Weldon, who has been chief executive officer for about 10 years, said he would step down April 26, after a series of recalls called into question the quality of some of the healthcare conglomerate’s products such as infant Tylenol. He will remain chairman of the board and has no plans to leave the company, said spokesman Al Wasilewski. Weldon had accumulated $95.1 million in various employee compensation programs and $48.4 million in pension benefits, according to a proxy filing released ahead of the company’s annual shareholders meeting in New Jersey on April 26. Weldon will not receive the money in a lump sum. Instead, he will receive it in installments that only start at the time he leaves the company. “This is compensation owed to him that has accumulated over a 40-year career, 10 of which he was the CEO of the company,” said Wasilewski. He said Weldon has already earned part of the money in a program that allows executives to defer some of their salary and bonuses. The company did not break out that amount but it is less than $21.4 million, according to the filing. “These are not new dollars and some are dollars he has elected to defer,” he said. Before he became CEO, Weldon, 63, spent three decades working his way through the company from his first job as a sales representative at J&J;’s McNeil consumer division.

245,JNJ,"Texas, Johnson & Johnson heading back to court","AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Representatives of Johnson & Johnson and the state of Texas will head back to court on Tuesday over a $158 million settlement agreement announced in January involving the drug Risperdal, a spokesman for Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said on Sunday. “As far as we knew, we had a solid settlement,” said Tom Kelley, Abbott’s spokesman. “We’ll have more information on Tuesday about what has caused (Johnson & Johnson) some concerns.” A spokeswoman for Johnson & Johnson declined to comment about the hearing before state District Judge John Dietz in Austin. Johnson & Johnson said in January that it would pay $158 million to settle a Texas lawsuit that accused the drugmaker of improperly marketing its Risperdal anti-psychotic drug to state residents on the Medicaid health program for the poor. The settlement would fully resolve all Risperdal-related claims in Texas, the company said at the time. The agreement — the largest Medicaid fraud recovery ever in Texas — was specific to the Lone Star State and did not involve other state or federal Risperdal litigation. The deal marked the first Risperdal settlement with any U.S. state. It settled claims brought by Texas in 2004 involving alleged Medicaid overpayments during the years 1994 to 2008. The settlement was to be paid to the original plaintiff, his attorneys, the state of Texas and the federal government, which provides Medicaid reimbursements, the company said in January. Tom Melsheimer, a lawyer for plaintiff Allen Jones, said on Sunday that the hearing on Tuesday is “just to finalize the settlement.” But Jones, a whistleblower on J&J;’s marketing practices, said the sticking point is that Johnson & Johnson wants to reduce the amount of the settlement that he and his attorneys receive. Johnson & Johnson “has reneged on the agreement and it’s back in court,” Jones said. “They are trying to produce a chilling effect on the ability of whistleblowers to come forward.” ",3252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnsonandjohnson-texas/texas-johnson-johnson-heading-back-to-court-idUSBRE82O0FM20120325

248,JNJ,UPDATE 1-J&J; drug shines in trial vs standard lung-clot drugs,"* Researcher cites fewer serious bleeds with J&J; drug * J&J; says Xarelto likely to become new standard of care * J&J; says to seek lung-clot approval in second quarter By Ransdell Pierson and Debra Sherman CHICAGO, March 26 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s  blood clot preventer Xarelto proved as effective as and safer than standard treatments against blood clots of the lung in a big study, possibly paving the way for it to become the eventual preferred treatment for the third most common cause of deaths in hospitals. Researchers and J&J; officials on Monday said the 4,833-patient study showed Xarelto was as effective as customary dual therapy — injections of the clot-buster heparin given about the same time as the blood-thinning pill warfarin — for treating the clots and preventing new lung clots or dangerous clots in the legs that can break free and cause lung clots. The vast majority of patients were treated for more than six months. The largest clinical trial ever conducted among lung-clot patients also showed that those taking Xarelto, also known by its chemical name rivaroxaban, experienced only half the number of major bleeding incidents, largely brain hemorrhages, as patients receiving the heparin/warfarin combination. Brain bleeding is one of the most worrisome side effects of warfarin, the active ingredient of rat poison that has been a mainstay anti-coagulant for more than half a century. “Rivaroxaban is just as good as standard treatment for pulmonary embolism — these data are pretty convincing — and this is an oral-only approach, which makes it very simple,” said Dr. Harry Buller, a professor of vascular medicine at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, who led the trial. In the J&J-sponsored; trial, 10.3 percent of patients taking Xarelto had major or minor bleeding, compared with 11.4 percent of those taking heparin and warfarin, Buller said. He said 1.1 percent of patients taking Xarelto experienced major bleeding, versus 2.2 percent on standard dual therapy. Buller presented the trial results on Monday at the annual scientific sessions of the American College of Cardiology in Chicago. “Xarelto has the potential to become the new standard of care,” Paul Burton, cardiovascular medical leader at J&J;’s Janssen division, said in an interview. “It may offer the opportunity for a single drug that doesn’t require monitoring to be used in acute and long-term treatment of pulmonary embolism.” Based on the favorable findings, J&J; said it plans in the second quarter to ask U.S. regulators to approve Xarelto for lung clots and leg clots. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said the new indications, if approved, could eventually bring an additional $250 million to $500 million in annual revenue for Xarelto. He said that would pale, however, in comparison with expected sales of the medicine for patients with atrial fibrillation. Lung clots develop in an estimated 600,000 Americans a year and kill as many as 100,000 of them. By blocking vital blood vessels, they often kill within less than an hour after symptoms develop. Because immobility is a major cause of lung clots, hospitalized patients are at particular risk of developing them. Xarelto, which J&J; developed in partnership with German drugmaker Bayer AG, is already approved to reduce the risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs of people who have had knee or hip replacement surgery. It is also approved to prevent strokes among people with irregular heartbeats, called atrial fibrillation. Xarelto, like Eliquis from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co  and Pfizer Inc, works by blocking a protein called Factor Xa involved in the clotting process. Neither of the new drugs carries the onerous demands of warfarin, such as the need for regular blood monitoring and strict avoidance of some foods. “The reason people look for alternatives (to warfarin) is that it’s a nightmare to give,” Buller said. “Rivaroxaban makes things easier for everybody — patients and physicians.” Although Eliquis is approved in Europe to prevent blood clots after hip and knee replacements, it is not approved to treat lung clots. It is awaiting U.S. approval to prevent strokes in atrial fibrillation patients, by far the biggest commercial opportunity for the new crop of blood clot preventers.",3262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/heart-clot-xarelto/update-1-jj-drug-shines-in-trial-vs-standard-lung-clot-drugs-idUSL2E8EQ7LY20120326

253,JNJ,"GE, Johnson & Johnson among firms to give more lobbying detail","BOSTON (Reuters) - A dozen U.S. companies have agreed to disclose more about their lobbying efforts in return for avoiding public showdowns at their annual meetings, a sign of growing traction for corporate governance reforms this year. Companies including Coca-Cola Co, General Electric Co. and Johnson & Johnson have agreed to make available more details about areas like trade association memberships and top policy issues, according to a tally of 2012 reforms kept by activist investor Walden Asset Management. In return for the changes, the Boston fund shop said it or its investor allies agreed to withdraw proxy proposals they had submitted in advance of this spring’s season for corporate annual meetings. Though some of the lobbying information was already available in government databases, much of it was too obscure for the average investor to track down, said Tim Smith, senior vice president at Walden who helped lead the disclosure campaign. Smith said the company actions show the disclosures are not just a pet concern of so-called socially responsible investors. “This is significant because the companies see it as being a good business practice,” Smith said. Representatives for GE and J&J; did not respond to questions. A Coca-Cola spokeswoman said under a new policy it will report its efforts in areas like lobbying more clearly. “The Coca-Cola Company supports transparency relating to corporate political contributions and lobbying expenses,” she said. Another 22 company activists targeted for lobbying disclosure have not announced any changes or concessions yet. As a result, Smith said, the issue will be debated and voted on at their upcoming annual shareholder meetings. Groups allied with Walden that filed similar resolutions include the public-sector labor union the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the New York State Common Retirement Fund; and several religious orders. In recent years, the investors have built a successful record of pressing for change on a variety of issues that are now common practice or law such as shareholder advisory votes on executive pay. Those votes and other scrutiny companies are getting from proxy-advisory firms are leading to a faster pace of governance changes, said Paul Hodgson, senior research associate at GMI Ratings. The New York-based organization tracks shareholder votes and has supported some changes such as separating the roles of chief executives and Board Chairmen — a major focus of AFSCME this year. “Companies know that giving in early or compromising is easier than the embarrassment of losing a high profile vote,” Hodgson said in an e-mail. Corporate spending to influence public policy has been a hot issue since a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision lifted limits on election spending by companies and unions. Smith and others are also part of an effort to get companies to agree to disclose political contributions led by the Center for Political Accountability in Washington. In March, it said 100 companies agreed to disclose direct political contributions and indirect spending through trade associations and similar groups. Among the companies where activists withdrew proxy proposals, the details vary and may be considered minor by some measures. For instance, Coca-Cola had already published a number of disclosures such as an online listing of its top policy priorities: corporate taxation, product-specific rules and environmental rules. Going forward, the Atlanta-based beverage company will provide more detail on areas like lobbying activity and trade association ties, according to Walden and the company spokeswoman.

J&J; said in a statement on Tuesday the binding offer includes the purchase of DePuy’s internal and external fixation products used in the treatment of bone fractures, as well as the organization supporting the business.

256,JNJ,Avon names J&J;'s McCoy as CEO; shares fall,"(Reuters) - Avon Products Inc (AVP.N) named Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) senior executive Sherilyn McCoy as its new CEO, presenting Coty Inc with another hurdle in its $10 billion bid for the world’s largest direct seller of cosmetics. The appointment of McCoy, who lost the competition for J&J;’s top job earlier this year, ended a four-month search for a fresh face to replace charismatic chairman and CEO Andrea Jung as Avon attempts to turn itself around. At J&J;, McCoy was responsible for brands including Neutrogena and Lubriderm. She is credited with reshaping a pharmaceuticals business that was facing patent expirations on major drugs. In 2011, she also took over a consumer business that was bedeviled by manufacturing issues that led to recalls of products ranging from Tylenol pain reliever to Aveeno baby calming lotion. In February, the problems continued, and Johnson & Johnson recalled its entire U.S. supply of infant Tylenol after parents complained about problems with a new dosing system. McCoy had “inherited a bit of a mess, but unfortunately for her I think that mess never got better,” Cowen & Co analyst Ian Sanderson said. Last week, Coty made an unsolicited $23.25 per-share offer for Avon, which on top of declining sales at home and in key markets including Brazil and Russia, is facing a U.S. probe into overseas bribery allegations. Avon rejected the bid, arguing that the company’s value could rise more under a new CEO than as part of Coty. Avon shares closed down 3.1 percent at $22.69 on Monday, falling below Coty’s offer. In recent years, Avon’s shareholders have been frustrated by the company’s problems under Jung, including two failed business restructurings. In the past year and a half leading up to Coty’s public declaration of its offer, Avon’s shares had fallen nearly 50 percent. Avon shelved a plan last year for another top-to-bottom company review until a new CEO was appointed. Many shareholders said they were willing to give McCoy some time to develop and implement a strategy for Avon. “Until we have a better sense of her, we’ll give her time to develop a strategy,” said Shawn Gault, a portfolio manager at Kempner Capital Management Inc. “I’m not opposed to the Coty deal, just not at this price.” McCoy, who like Jung graduated from Princeton University, is due to take the chief executive’s reins on April 23. She will also serve on Avon’s board of directors. Coty Chairman Bart Becht said in an interview last Monday after Coty disclosed its bid for Avon that the bid process would be complicated by Avon’s naming of a new CEO. Coty could not immediately be reached for a comment on McCoy’s appointment. Coty was expected to begin wooing major shareholders this week to sell them on the deal. Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said that investors’ lack of familiarity with McCoy, Jung’s continued involvement as chairman, and the timing of the announcement so quickly after Coty’s bid would likely disappoint investors. Avon, famous for its “Ding Dong, Avon Calling” advertisements in the 1950s and 1960s, said in December it would look outside the company for a replacement for Jung, 53. She will become executive chairman for two years. Avon has said that it would keep Jung on for that time period because she plays a key role in motivating the company’s 6 million sales representatives. McCoy, 53, was with Johnson & Johnson for three decades, and most recently served as its vice chairman of pharmaceutical, consumer, corporate office of science and technology, and information technology divisions. Fred Hassan, lead director of Avon’s board, said in a statement that McCoy has “a unique combination of strategic and finely honed operational skills, a significant turnaround track record, global experience and people leadership.” Analysts gave her high marks for reshaping the company’s pharmaceutical business as it faced patent expirations on some major drugs including the antipsychotic Risperdal and the epilepsy treatment Topamax. But in January 2011, McCoy also took control of the consumer products business, which includes the Tylenol and Neutrogena brands. The over-the-counter drug business was already facing manufacturing issues that had caused a number of recalls. Quality control problems at J&J;’s consumer unit were deemed so pervasive that U.S. health regulators took over supervision of three manufacturing plants a year ago. McCoy was promoted to the post of vice chairman at J&J; in December 2010, setting her up as a possible successor to CEO William Weldon. But in February, J&J; said that Alex Gorsky, who was named vice chairman at the same time as McCoy, would be the company’s CEO, effective April 26. McCoy joined J&J; in 1982 as a scientist in the company’s personal products unit. She had been in charge of J&J;’s pharmaceutical division since 2009 and has held senior management roles in the company’s medical device business. “You have got to give her some credit for reshaping the pharmaceutical division into a very well-run and what looks like a very well-positioned business at J&J;,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. Cowen analyst Sanderson said McCoy was “very impressive” when she ran a meeting for analysts and investors to review J&J;’s pharmaceutical business last May. “She has really steered that business through some fairly major patent expirations over the past couple of years and made the pipeline relevant again,” Sanderson said, pointing to new medicines for prostate cancer, stroke prevention and psoriasis.

The news comes a week after the world’s largest direct seller of cosmetics rejected a takeover bid from fragrance company Coty Inc. McCoy, 53, was with the pharmaceutical company for three decades, and most recently served as vice chairman of Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical, consumer, corporate office of science and technology, and information technology divisions. McCoy will also serve as a director on Avon’s board. She will take up the new post April 23. In December, Avon announced it would look outside the company for a replacement for current Chairman and CEO Andrea Jung, 53, who will become executive chairman. Some Avon investors said last week that they wanted to wait to see a new CEO’s plans for the company, rather than accepting a bid for Coty. Coty could not immediately be reached for a comment on the appointment. Avon’s new CEO faces the tough task of turning around a company that has seen sliding sales at home and in emerging markets such as Brazil and Russia. The new CEO will also have to work to boost the morale of its diminished and often demoralized army of U.S. sales representatives. The company, famous for the “Ding Dong, Avon Calling” advertisements in the 1950s and 1960s, also faces a federal probe into whether it broke U.S. anti-bribery laws overseas. The new CEO has “a unique combination of strategic and finely honed operational skills, a significant turnaround track record, global experience and people leadership,” Fred Hassan, lead director of  Avon’s Board, said. McCoy will report to the company’s board of directors, Avon said in a statement on Monday. McCoy was promoted to the post of vice chairman at J&J; in December 2010, setting her up as a possible successor to CEO William Weldon.

In a statement, Weldon said McCoy “was instrumental in helping to bring stronger strategic focus to our pharmaceutical business as it builds a robust pipeline and launches important new medicines; and to our consumer business as it leverages the success of its iconic brands and worked to resolve some recent challenges.” Avon’s shares fell about 2.9 percent to $22.75 in premarket trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

259,JNJ,J&J; hit with $1.1 billion Risperdal penalty in Arkansas,"(Reuters) - An Arkansas state judge has ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay a $1.1 billion penalty after a jury found the company guilty of using fraudulent tactics to sell its Risperdal anti-psychotic medicine. Arkansas sued the diversified healthcare company, saying it had deceived thousands of doctors in the state by touting the one-time blockbuster medicine as better and safer than rival therapies and marketing it for unapproved uses in children and the elderly. The state alleged the company had caused its Medicaid insurance program for the poor to greatly overpay for Risperdal. Following a two-week trial in Pulaski County Circuit Court in Little Rock, a jury on Tuesday found that J&J; had marketed the drug inappropriately. Judge Tim Fox handed down the $1.1 billion penalty on Wednesday. “We are disappointed with the judge’s decision on penalties,” said J&J; spokeswoman Teresa Mueller, who confirmed the award. She said J&J; would appeal the award if the company’s motion for a new trial is denied. A clerk for Judge Fox declined to provide details from his decision, saying it had not yet been formally filed with the court. J&J; in January said it would pay $158 million to settle a Texas lawsuit accusing it of improperly marketing Risperdal to patients in that state’s Medicaid program, and similar lawsuits are pending in a number of other states. The Texas settlement fully resolved claims in that state but did not affect other state and federal Risperdal litigation. The U.S. Department of Justice for years has been investigating allegations that J&J; marketed Risperdal for unapproved uses, including for nursing home residents.

264,JNJ,"J&J; quarterly profit beats forecast, but sales lag","(Reuters) - Declining sales dogged Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in the first quarter, illustrating the company’s struggle to revive growth in all three of its main businesses and tough challenges ahead for incoming Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky. Gorsky, a company vice president, on April 26 takes the helm of J&J;, which for most of the past century has posted dependable double-digit annual profit growth. “Gorsky’s toughest challenge will be to turn the corner on manufacturing issues,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, referring to quality-control lapses at its factories that have sparked recalls of Tylenol and many other over-the counter products since 2010. “J&J; initially had high hopes of making a big dent in fixing the problems by 2011, but then pushed it back to 2012 and then 2013 and it could go to 2014.” First quarter company revenue fell slightly on anemic sales of consumer medicines and its medical devices - another business that has been hit by costly recalls in the past two years. Net earnings rose to $3.91 billion, or $1.41 per share, from $3.48 billion, or $1.25 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, J&J; earned $1.37 per share, topping the analysts’ average forecast of $1.35 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue slipped 0.2 percent to $16.14 billion, while Wall Street expected $16.26 billion. J&J; said sales would have risen 1 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in overseas markets. Company shares, which were little changed in afternoon trading, have barely budged in the past two years, amid moderate gains for the drug sector and 15 percent growth for the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index .SPX. Sales of J&J; consumer products, including its over-the-counter medicines, slipped 2.4 percent to $3.6 billion in the first quarter. Conover said the McNeil consumer healthcare unit that makes the OTC brands had peak sales of $5.9 billion in 2008, representing more than 9 percent of total company revenue. The unit’s sales last year dropped to $4.4 billion, or only 6 percent to 7 percent of company revenue, as a giant plant in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania remained down for repairs. “Manufacturing problems always plague companies longer than they expect,” Conover said. “But once McNeil regains full capacity, if its products regain market share they could generate a 2 percent boost in company earnings.” Profits have also been hurt by generic competition for its prescription drugs. The company has also had to grapple with a weak global economy that has cut demand for elective surgeries and therefore for its vast array of medical devices and diagnostics. “Utilization of medical products has not been exactly robust for J&J; or the (device) industry, and Gorsky can’t change the global economy,” said Les Funtleyder, portfolio manager for Miller Tabak & Co. “So if they don’t see a pickup, they’ll have to find other sources of growth — either expanding use of current products or finding new products.” The quarter was “a little light on revenue, especially in the consumer and device businesses,” Gabelli & Co analyst Jeff Jonas said. But he added that the company had impressively controlled sales, general and administrative costs, as well as spending on research and development. “That’s something they’ve been promising for a long time and we haven’t really seen until now,” Jonas said. Jonas said the company’s new Zytiga prostate cancer treatment was a standout performer in the quarter. “That’s definitely going to be a billion-dollar-plus drug,” he said, adding that HIV drugs also did well. Global sales of prescription drugs rose 1.2 percent to $6.1 billion in the quarter, held back by generic competition for J&J;’s Levaquin antibiotic and Concerta treatment for attention deficit disorder. Medical device and diagnostic sales slipped 0.3 percent, weighed down by J&J;’s discontinuation of drug-coated heart stents and widely publicized recalls of its faulty DePuy ASR hip replacement products.

267,JNJ,J&J; gains EU clearance for $21 billion Synthes deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), which on Thursday secured EU clearance to purchase Swiss medical device maker Synthes Inc SYST.VX for about $21 billion, said it expects the deal to close in the current quarter. The company is still awaiting similar clearance from U.S. anti-trust regulators, and said in a regulatory filing that the companies agreed to extend the deal’s closing date - typically one year from the original merger agreement - by 60 days to June 25. In a separate filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, J&J; said its board had amended company bylaws to allow the roles of chairman and chief executive officer to be held by different individuals. The move comes a week before Alex Gorsky takes the helm from longtime CEO William Weldon and appears to be a formality after the company previously announced that Weldon would remain chairman of the board. The Synthes deal is J&J;’s largest acquisition. It won EU regulatory approval after J&J; committed to divest its trauma business in Europe, which had raised competition concerns. The European Commission, the EU’s competition watchdog, said in a statement that the merged group would continue to face competition from several strong rivals and that customers would still have sufficient alternative suppliers. “We obtained remedies to ensure that competition will remain strong in these markets, for the ultimate benefit of patients and social security systems,” EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

273,JNJ,New J&J; CEO parachuting into tough terrain,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) is sending in a former Army Ranger to clean up several big messes that have hurt its reputation, earnings and share price in the past three years. Alex Gorsky said in an interview his biggest priority is to complete a revamping of the company’s factories and manufacturing processes to fix quality control lapses that sparked huge recalls of Tylenol, Motrin and dozens of other consumer medicines over the past three years. “Mission No. 1, 2 and 3 is getting these products back on the shelves,” said the 51-year old who becomes chief executive at J&J;’s annual shareholders meeting on Thursday. The company is working overtime, under close federal supervision, to revamp a big factory in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, where most of the Tylenol brands were manufactured. The company had hoped to solve the problems by 2011, but now expects the task to stretch into 2013. Some analysts fret it could take until 2014, costing billions of dollars of additional lost sales and further jeopardizing consumers’ brand loyalty. “We are all disappointed but we are absolutely committed to getting these fixed, and moving on. And we’re in the throes of that as we speak,” Gorsky said, “with a lot of changes in place ... a lot of new processes, investments, new auditing procedures.” Gorsky has climbed the ladder at the diversified healthcare company from his start as a salesman in 1988, with senior management roles in the company’s pharmaceuticals and medical device businesses. The new CEO will also have to grapple with costly recall of approximately 93,000 metal-on-metal artificial hips made by J&J;’s DePuy orthopedics unit. The company recently took a $3 billion charge for the August 2010 recall of the defective ASR products. J&J; is expected to offer settlements to the patients who received the ASR devices, which have a failure rate approaching 30 percent — three times the typical rate of similar rival devices. The devices were recalled about a year after Gorsky was named global chairman of J&J;’s medical devices group. And federal investigators have asked Gorsky to personally testify in a lawsuit involving allegations the company improperly marketed its Risperdal schizophrenia drug for unapproved uses in children and the elderly. An Arkansas judge earlier this month ordered J&J; to pay a $1.1 billion penalty for alleged fraudulent marketing of the former blockbuster product. Similar lawsuits are pending in a number of other states, and the federal government is investigating the allegations. Gorsky declined to comment on the hips and Risperdal litigation, citing the ongoing investigations and lawsuits. He said his other biggest priorities are to successfully integrate J&J;’s biggest planned acquisition, of Swiss medical device maker Synthes, once the $21 billion deal is approved by U.S. regulators, and to steer a promising array of experimental drugs successfully through clinical trials. “Where I see tremendous growth opportunity is continuing launches of our pharmaceutical brands,” he said, following introductions of five new drugs in the past two years — including promising treatments for prostate cancer and hepatitis C. “I’d say our (drug) pipeline is as good or better than anyone in the industry,” he said, noting that J&J;’s sales of prescription drugs are on the rebound following patent expirations on Risperdal, epilepsy treatment Topamax and its Levaquin antibiotic that left the medicines prey to generic competition. J&J;, whose hundreds of healthcare units have considerable autonomy, has generated reliable double-digit annual profit growth for most of the past century, largely through acquisitions. But Gorsky declined to comment on which of J&J;’s three main businesses it might most bolster through deals in the next few years. “We’re always looking for big areas of unmet need and big growth opportunities. Having this diverse capability enables us to do things other companies cannot do,” he said, such as combining drugs and medical devices into a single product — like its experimental Sedasys sedation system for endoscopy patients. J&J;’s current chief executive, William Weldon, will remain chairman of the company after Gorsky takes over as CEO. Although the company’s shares have barely budged since Weldon took over a decade ago, he could receive more than $140 million in retirement pay when he eventually leaves the company, according to J&J; regulatory filings. Gorsky will become only the ninth top executive in J&J;’s 125-year history, meaning its CEOs have held sway for an average of almost 16 years each. Asked if he planned to lead J&J; that long, Gorsky quipped, “We try to manage the CEO business as we do our business, for the long term. That’s the way I certainly hope to do it myself.” Gorsky is a graduate of West Point and spent six years in the U.S. Army, where he was a captain in the elite U.S. Army Rangers. “You never say Ranger in the past tense, I’m still a Ranger,” Gorsky said, adding that his military responsibilities have played a big hand in his business success. “What helped me more than anything else was problem solving; you find yourself in very challenging situations — how do you quickly collect the facts you need and do the right critical thinking and how decisive are you in putting together a plan with the right contingencies? “And the first rule of leadership is you have to learn to be a good follower. And it’s also about diversity — being able to work with a broad range of people with different backgrounds. If all look, sound and say the same things, we’re not really adding the value.” (This story corrects to omit melanoma drug as recently introduced medicine In paragraph 14) ",4262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnsonandjohnson/new-jj-ceo-parachuting-into-tough-terrain-idUSBRE83P17120120426

276,JNJ,UPDATE 1-Furiex says J&J; returns sexual dysfunction drug rights,"May 14 (Reuters) - Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc said its partner Johnson & Johnson returned the worldwide rights for its oral drug to treat premature ejaculation. Furiex said it has licensed the rights of the drug to European pharmaceutical company Menarini in Europe, most of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East for $15 million in cash. Furiex will also get up to $60 million if the drug clears certain regulatory and sales milestones. The drug, Priligy, which is still not approved in the United States, is marketed by J&J; unit Janssen Pharmaceutica in 15 countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America. The company expects to close the asset transfer agreement with Janssen in the third quarter. Furiex will retain full development and commercialization rights in the United States, Japan and Canada. Furiex, which had licensed the drug to Janssen, was earning royalties and sales-based milestones from Janssen.

277,JNJ,J&J; drug shows promise in high-risk prostate cancer,"(Reuters) - Adding Johnson & Johnson’s advanced prostate cancer drug, Zytiga, to hormone therapy before surgery has been shown for the first time to eradicate tumors in some men with high-risk forms of the disease. The mid-stage trial found that six months of treatment with the combination therapy completely or nearly eliminated the cancer in a third of patients, all of whom had localized, aggressive cancer. “These results are very impressive, especially given these high-risk patients,” Dr Mary-Ellen Taplin, associate professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and the study’s lead author, said at a news conference. Zytiga is already approved to treat advanced prostate cancer in patients who previously received chemotherapy. J&J; expects to file in the second half of this year for U.S. regulatory approval of the drug as a treatment for men with metastatic prostate cancer who have not yet received chemotherapy. Zytiga, also known as abiraterone, costs about $5,000 a month. It is a member of a new drug class designed to work inside cancer cells to block production of testosterone, the male hormone that fuels prostate cancer cell growth. Localized high-risk disease is defined as prostate cancer in men with high levels of prostate-specific antigen and aggressive disease that has spread throughout the prostate. Men with this stage of disease tend to have a poor prognosis, and the cancer often spreads to other parts of the body despite aggressive treatment with available therapies, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which featured the Zytiga data ahead of its annual meeting in Chicago, June 1-5. “Theoretically ... when you get a complete disappearance of the primary cancer, patient outcomes are much better,” said oncologist Dr. Nicholas Vogelzang, chair of ASCO’s cancer communications committee, who was not involved in the research. He noted that such pre-surgery treatment has become standard care for other types of cancer. The Phase 2 trial looked at the effect of adding Zytiga to Lupron, a drug designed to trick the testicles into ceasing production of testosterone. Of the 29 men who received the drugs for six months before having prostate surgery, the prostates of three had no evidence of cancer and seven had nearly complete elimination of the disease. In the group of men treated for three months before their surgery, 15 percent had little to no detectable cancer in the prostate. Researchers said the therapy was well-tolerated by both groups. They reported five cases of elevated liver enzymes and three patients with lower-than-normal levels of potassium. “Our findings suggest that this combination therapy approach could improve outcomes for a substantial number of men,” Taplin said. “This is a 58-patient trial with a very, very expensive drug, so I don’t think anybody is going to be encouraging this type of treatment without more data.” She said other trials are under way, including a similar trial combining Zytiga with experimental drug ARN-509, which is being developed by Aragon Pharmaceuticals.

278,JNJ,FDA staff sends mixed message on J&J; drug Xarelto,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. drug reviewers had mixed opinions about whether Johnson & Johnson blood thinner Xarelto reduced the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people with heart problems, setting the stage for heated debate by outside experts later this week. Some U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff members raised doubts about how well the drug worked, given the high number of people who dropped out of studies on the pill. But the FDA’s clinical reviewer recommended approval. The staff appeared united in the view that the data did not prove Xarelto reduced the risk of death in patients with acute coronary syndrome, which analysts had seen as the drug’s most important advantage for treating this heart condition. An FDA advisory panel of outside experts will vote Wednesday on whether to recommend the drug, which J&J; developed in partnership with German drugmaker Bayer AG. The FDA usually follows panel recommendations, although it is not required to. The agency is due to make a final decision on Xarelto by the end of June. The FDA’s medical team leader, Dr. Thomas Marciniak, questioned whether Xarelto truly helped people with heart problems, since J&J; lost track of an average of 12 percent of people taking the pill in clinical trials. He also said the company did not count three people who died after taking the drug, which could skew results. “These three uncounted deaths may be the tip of the iceberg regarding problems with missing data,” he said in FDA briefing documents posted online on Monday. But the FDA’s clinical reviewer, Dr. Karen Hicks, said J&J; had recognized the problem of missing data and tried to fix it. Many other heart trials have the same problem, she said, recommending approval. However, Hicks said Xarelto did not reduce the risk of death and that minor bleeding issues with the pill might be a concern if it is approved for acute coronary syndrome patients. Xarelto is already approved to reduce the risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs of people who have had knee or hip replacement surgery. It is also approved to prevent strokes among people with irregular heartbeats, called atrial fibrillation. Acute coronary syndrome refers to people who have heart attacks or chest pain, usually because of a blocked coronary artery. About 1 million people in the United States are hospitalized each year after having an ACS episode, usually a heart attack, according to researchers. Janssen, the J&J; unit that markets Xarelto, had expected some people to drop out of the final clinical trial since it enrolled about 15,500 patients and studied them for about 2 1/2 years, spokesman Ernie Knewitz said. The dropout rates were similar between people taking Xarelto and those on placebo, he said. “Our analyses show that (the discontinuation rate) did not impact the robustness of the study’s results,” he said. Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said he still believed the FDA advisory panel would recommend Xarelto for ACS patients because of the FDA reviewer’s recommendation. “We expect a very heated debate on (Wednesday),” he said in a research note. “However, we continue to expect a positive outcome.” Biegelsen said the increased risk of bleeding meant Xarelto would have modest sales for people with acute coronary syndrome, reaching $342 million in 2016. The drug’s use in such patients should be about 22 percent of Xarelto’s overall U.S. sales of $1.6 billion in 2016, he said. Xarelto is one of three new medicines that offer potential advantages over older drugs to prevent strokes and other dangerous conditions caused by blood clots, in a market worth up to $10 billion in annual sales, according to Wall Street forecasts. Investors have tried to bet on which of the three will become the dominant player in a race between Xarelto, Eliquis from Pfizer Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa. Xarelto’s rivals failed in treating patients with ACS, giving Bayer and J&J; a potentially distinct market — although stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation is seen as the most lucrative use for the new drugs. Shares of J&J; rose 0.2 percent to $63.46 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, in line with the broader Arca Pharmaceuticals Index.

The speciality pharma company, which already has the U.S. supply rights for the medicine to treat toxicity of cancer drug 5-FU, said it retained the option to acquire the European commercial rights from Wellstat upon approval. The group also benefitted from the first royalties from Johnson & Johnson’s Zytiga, a drug to treat advanced prostate cancer that was approved last year in the United States and Europe. BTG made a pretax profit of 23 million pounds ($36.4 million), against a loss of 10.8 million pounds in the same period a year ago, on revenue 77 percent higher at 197 million pounds.

282,JNJ,U.S. advisers reject new use for J&J;/Bayer's Xarelto,"SILVER SPRING, Maryland (Reuters) - U.S. advisers recommended against expanding the use of Johnson & Johnson’s blood thinner Xarelto as a way to reduce the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people with heart problems. A panel of outside experts to the Food and Drug Administration voted on Wednesday that the pill should not be approved for people with acute coronary syndrome.

The trial tested Xarelto as an addition to aspirin, and other clot preventers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi’s Plavix, which are typically used to treat the condition. By a vote of 6 to 4, with one abstention, the panel said Xarelto looked promising but missing data could skew results. They were also concerned about bleeding risks. “I want to see better evidence that this strategy of adding (Xarelto) ...is robustly better for the patient,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, panel member and chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. “And I just wasn’t convinced.” The FDA usually follows panel recommendations, although it is not required to, and a final decision is expected by the end of June.

Pradaxa gained U.S. approval in 2010, while Eliquis is still under review by the FDA, with a decision expected by the end of June. Xarelto’s rivals failed in treating patients with ACS, giving Bayer and J&J; a potentially distinct market — although stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation is seen as the most lucrative use for the new drugs. In a clinical trial of ACS, people who took a 2.5 milligram dose of Xarelto in addition to an aspirin and another anti-platelet medication had a 15 percent lower risk of having a stroke or dying from a heart attack than people just taking the other medicines, FDA reviewers said. On the other hand, patients taking Xarelto had twice as much risk for a major fatal bleeding compared to the older drugs, while other kinds of bleeding were three times higher with Xarelto. But the overall rates were still low: only 0.1 percent of patients had fatal bleeding while taking the drug and 2 percent had some kind of bleeding. The FDA advisers decided the balance between the heart benefits of Xarelto and its bleeding risks tilted against the drug because the company lost track of an average of 12 percent of patients during clinical trial.

285,JNJ,"J&J;, Amazon on list that hedge funds love to hate","BOSTON, May 23 (Reuters) - Hedge funds turned their backs on Johnson & Johnson and Amazon.com Inc in the last months, kicking the former market darlings into a group where they see stock prices dropping, research from Goldman Sachs shows. Healthcare company Johnson & Johnson, whose share price slipped 3.14 percent through mid-May from Jan. 1, now heads Goldman’s newly created list of “50 Very Important Short Positions.” Exxon Mobil Corp., Intel Corp,  International Business Machines and Amazon.com round out the top five companies that represent the largest short positions in the $2 trillion hedge fund industry. The listing is the newly created counterweight to Goldman’s widely followed VIP list which ranks the 50 stocks that matter most to hedge funds. Four of the five top names now on the short list - Exxon, J&J;, Amazon.com and IBM - were listed among the industry’s 50 favorites only three months ago when Goldman last issued its list in February. The change in heart comes even as some of the named  short companies saw share prices rise or dip only modestly. Online retailer Amazon, for example, was up 24 percent through mid-May from the start of the year. But now some managers are clearly worried. Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn, who has been known to tank a stock by simply uttering its name, cast doubt over Amazon a week ago when he called the company’s future a “riddle” at the Ira Sohn investment conference. His musings sparked speculation that he might be short Amazon or might soon go short Amazon. His spokesman declined to comment. For hedge fund managers, going short, or betting a stock will fall, has long been a key to success. But not this year. Goldman research found that hedge funds’ “short stock selections have caused hedge funds to lag both the S&P; 500 and the average large-cap mutual fund so far in 2012.” The average hedge fund had gained 4 percent through the middle of May while the broader market was up twice that, Goldman’s research showed. During the first three months of 2012, hedge funds turned more optimistic, increasing their net long exposure slightly to 49 percent from 46 percent at the end of the fourth quarter 2011. Most hedge funds still liked what they already liked, leaving them to turn over only 31 percent of all positions. The industry continued its love affair with technology industry darling Apple Inc, where the stock price is up 37.5 percent despite some roller-coaster moves. Apple ranked No. 1 on the list of stocks that matter most to hedge funds followed by internet software giant Google Inc. Financial services giant JP Morgan Chase, whose acknowledgement of a multi-billion dollar trading loss has pushed its share price down 21 percent this month, still ranked among the industry’s favorite stocks but did drop to No. 9 from No. 4. Newcomers on the favorites list include car company Ford Motor Co, whose dramatically improved financial health led to a ratings upgrade from Moody’s Investors Services this week, insurer American International Group, whose earnings more than doubled in the first quarter, and billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Goldman found that the basket of 50 stocks that “matter most” has outperformed the S&P; 500 by 55 basis points on a quarterly basis since 2001 and has outperformed the S&P; 500 by 62 basis points for the year to date through May 15.",5232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/hedgefunds-goldmanlist/jj-amazon-on-list-that-hedge-funds-love-to-hate-idUSL1E8GN8HK20120523

287,JNJ,UPDATE 3-US advisers reject J&J;/Bayer's Xarelto for acute coronary patients,"* Xarelto already approved for two other uses * FDA advisers concerned about missing data, bleeding risks * FDA to make a final decision by end of June By Anna Yukhananov SILVER SPRING, Md., May 23 (Reuters) - U.S. advisers recommended against expanding the use of Johnson & Johnson’s  blood thinner Xarelto as a way to reduce the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people with heart problems. A panel of outside experts to the Food and Drug Administration voted on Wednesday that the pill should not be approved for people with acute coronary syndrome. J&J; developed the drug in partnership with German drugmaker Bayer AG. Xarelto is already approved for use to reduce the risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs of people who have had knee or hip replacement surgery. It is also approved to prevent strokes among people with a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. But the companies wanted to expand its use to treat acute coronary syndrome, which refers to people who have heart attacks or chest pain, usually because of a blocked coronary artery. About 1 million people in the United States are hospitalized each year after having an ACS episode, often a heart attack, according to researchers. The trial tested Xarelto as an addition to aspirin, and other clot preventers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanofi’s Plavix, which are typically used to treat the condition. By a vote of 6 to 4, with one abstention, the panel said Xarelto looked promising but missing data could skew results. They were also concerned about bleeding risks. “I want to see better evidence that this strategy of adding (Xarelto) ...is robustly better for the patient,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, panel member and chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. “And I just wasn’t convinced.” The FDA usually follows panel recommendations, although it is not required to, and a final decision is expected by the end of June. “We appreciate the thoroughness of the committee’s review, and will ensure the questions raised today are addressed with the FDA,” sa id Paul Burton, a vice president with Janssen Research & Development, the J&J; unit that markets Xarelto. THREE-WAY RACE Xarelto is one of three new medicines that offer potential advantages over older drugs to prevent strokes and other dangerous conditions caused by blood clots, in a market worth up to $10 billion in annual sales, according to Wall Street forecasts. Investors have tried to bet on which of the three will become the dominant player in a race between Xarelto, Eliquis from Pfizer Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa. Pradaxa gained U.S. approval in 2010, while Eliquis is still under FDA review, with a decision expected by the end of June. Xarelto’s rivals failed in treating patients with ACS, giving Bayer and J&J; a potentially distinct market — although stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation is seen as the most lucrative use for the new drugs. In a clinical trial of ACS, people who took a 2.5 milligram dose of Xarelto in addition to an aspirin and another anti-platelet medication had a 15 percent lower risk of having a stroke or dying from a heart attack than people just taking the other medicines, FDA reviewers said. On the other hand, patients taking Xarelto had twice as much risk for a major fatal bleeding compared to the older drugs, while other kinds of bleeding were three times higher with Xarelto. But the overall rates were still low: only 0.1 percent of patients had fatal bleeding while taking the drug and 2 percent had some kind of bleeding. The FDA advisers decided the balance between the heart benefits of Xarelto and its bleeding risks tilted against the drug because the company lost track of an average of 12 percent of patients during clinical trial. It was unclear how those patients fared while taking the medicine. “Were there not questions about loss to follow-up and missing data, it would have been a yes,” said Allan Coukell, a pharmacist and the panel’s consumer representative, when explaining his ‘no’ vote on Xarelto. J&J; has said it expected some people to drop out of the final clinical trial since it enrolled about 15,500 patients and studied them for about 2 1/2 years, and the dropout rates were similar between people taking Xarelto and those on the older drugs, meaning the missing data should not impact the results.",5242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/fda-jj/update-3-us-advisers-reject-jj-bayers-xarelto-for-acute-coronary-patients-idUSL1E8GNGOI20120524

289,JNJ,US FDA warns J&J; unit about tampon complaints,"* Also 227 complaints about K-Y Liquibeads * FDA: J&J; never got permission to sell K-Y Liquibeads WASHINGTON, May 29 (Reuters) - U.S. drug regulators chided a Johnson & Johnson unit for not reporting or investigating customer complaints about O.B. Tampons or personal lubricants similar to K-Y Jelly. The Food and Drug Administration said the unit, McNeil-PPC Inc, did not properly follow up on complaints that included toxic shock syndrome from using the tampon, according to a warning letter posted on the FDA’s website on Tuesday. The company also did not investigate some complaints about the personal lubricant K-Y Liquibeads Vaginal Moisturizer, which in fact it never got permission to sell, the FDA said in the letter dated May 22. J&J; has recalled hundreds of millions of bottles and packages of its over-the-counter medicines in the past few years, such as the painkillers Tylenol and Motrin, due to quality lapses at its factories. The FDA said McNeil-PPC never told regulators it planned to sell the K-Y Liquibeads, and made substantial changes to the lubricant compared with previous, similar products without getting permission to do so. The company received 227 complaints about the product from the end of June 2010 until December 2011, including the fact the lubricant did not dissolve or had “uncharacteristic” consistency, the FDA said. The agency said J&J; must respond within 15 business days about how it will address the issues, or risk facing seizure of its products or a fine. J&J; spokeswoman Jodie Wertheim said McNeil PPC takes the FDA’s concerns seriously and will do whatever is necessary to resolve the issues.",5292012,http://www.reuters.com/article/fda-jj/us-fda-warns-jj-unit-about-tampon-complaints-idUSL1E8GTBIO20120529

291,JNJ,J&J; hormone-blocking pill slows prostate cancer spread,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A trial of Johnson & Johnson’s Zytiga in certain prostate cancer patients showed that it doubled the amount of time they lived without the disease getting worse, potentially offering new hope for patients who see their cancer return. The trial, involving 1,088 patients who had stopped responding to traditional hormonal drugs but had not been treated with chemotherapy, found that Zytiga slowed the spread of the disease by 58 percent. Zytiga is one of several new prostate cancer treatments that may significantly prolong the life of patients by zeroing in more closely on certain mechanisms that help tumors proliferate. New data on the medications are being presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago. The drug’s robust results in earlier-stage cancer - it is already approved for men with prostate cancer who previously received chemotherapy - have implications for companies like Dendreon, which sells therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine Provenge, and Medivation, which is developing a drug with a mechanism of action similar to Zytiga’s. The Zytiga trial found that patients given a placebo and the steroid prednisone went a median of 8.3 months before their disease worsened. Patients treated with the steroid and Zytiga were still faring better at the time the data were analyzed, so a comparable statistic was not yet available. The study’s lead investigator, Dr Charles Ryan of the University of California, San Francisco’s Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, estimated that the Zytiga patients would enjoy at least 16 months of progression free survival (PFS). The trial also found that prednisone-only patients lived for a median of 27.2 months. Overall survival for patients treated with Zytiga had also not yet been reached, but J&J; estimated that it improved their survival by 33 percent, or 9 months. That would clearly surpass the 4.1 month survival benefit demonstrated by Provenge, which was tested in a similar patient population. “We believe the perception is that this is clearly negative for Provenge,” JP Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said in a research note, while emphasizing that he believes physicians will still see a place for using immunotherapies such as the Dendreon drug. The Zytiga pre-chemotherapy trial was stopped ahead of schedule in March after it became clear patients were benefiting from the drug, a member of a new class designed to work inside cancer cells to block the production of testosterone, the male hormone that fuels prostate cancer cell growth. Prostate cancer is the second most common form of cancer in men, with some 30,000 dying from the disease each year in the United States alone and 250,000 globally. Around a third of patients need no treatment, because their disease does not metastasize, or spread, while another third are treated and cured. But for the remaining patients, the cancer will recur following treatment or spread to the bones, lymph nodes or other parts of the body. Prostate cancer can turn lethal when it spreads and when it resists standard hormonal therapy. Research presented at ASCO showed that a pivotal trial of Medivation’s enzalutamide met all of its secondary goals - including improvements in quality of life. Medivation and development partner Astellas Pharma, which previously said the experimental drug improved survival by nearly 5 months in a trial of advanced prostate cancer patients, filed in May for U.S. regulatory approval of enzalutamide. Details released on Saturday included data showing that the Medivation drug, designed to block testosterone from binding to cancer cells, reduced the risk of skeletal-related events, including fractures, by 38 percent. Data will also be presented at ASCO from trials of alpharadin, a drug designed to deliver minute, highly-charged doses of radiation to secondary tumors in the bone that is being developed by Bayer AG and Algeta ASA. J&J; expects to file in the second half of this year for U.S. regulatory approval of Zytiga, also known as abiraterone, as a treatment for men with metastatic prostate cancer who have not yet received chemotherapy. “Clearly, if we’re showing greater benefit in the pre-chemotherapy population ... I don’t think its unreasonable that they (clinicians) would move it up,” said Michael Meyers, head of the drug’s development at J&J.; The study also showed that Zytiga significantly delayed the need for pain drugs taken to reduce side effects and eventual chemotherapy. The drug is currently given for eight months at a cost of around $44,000. Barclays estimates peak U.S. Zytiga sales of $1.5 billion by 2015, with $700 million from cases where it is used after chemotherapy and $800 million from patients who have yet to try chemo. Side effects associated with the drug included cardiac disorders, high blood pressure and increased liver enzyme levels. J&J;’s Meyers said the safety profile seen with Zytiga in the latest trial was similar to earlier studies, even though patients were exposed to the drug for nearly twice as long. He said the side effects “for the most part did not disrupt treatment and were easily managed by routine medical interventions.” ",6022012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cancer-prostate-zytiga/jj-hormone-blocking-pill-slows-prostate-cancer-spread-idUSBRE85102M20120602
292,JNJ,J&J; to halt sales of controversial vaginal implants,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said it would stop selling vaginal mesh implants after a raft of lawsuits about the devices causing complications such as infections and bleeding. The diversified healthcare agency and numerous other device makers have been sued in recent years by patients who allege organ damage and other injuries from the implants, many of which are used to support weakened vaginal muscles. There are over a thousand lawsuits pending against Ethicon Inc, the J&J; unit that makes the devices. J&J; spokesman Matthew Johnson said on Tuesday that the company has asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for permission to stop selling four of its mesh products within the next four months, after giving hospitals and surgeons time to select other options. It plans to stop selling the products worldwide within the next three to nine months. The FDA has said the company sold one type of vaginal implant, the Gynecare Prolift Pelvic Floor Repair System, for three years without getting official permission. Surgical mesh is commonly implanted in women to repair weakened or damaged tissue and provide support in cases of pelvic organ prolapse (POP). The condition happens when tissue that holds the pelvic organs in place becomes weak or stretched and bulges into the vagina. There are different types of such prolapse, including vaginal prolapse, usually after menopause, childbirth or a hysterectomy. The mesh is also used to help patients with a severe overactive bladder known as stress urinary incontinence. About 75,000 women received mesh repairs for pelvic organ prolapse in 2010 and about 200,000 received transvaginal repairs for stress urinary incontinence, according to the FDA. Most devices now get FDA approval under a special process known as 510(k) that allows companies to sell the mesh if they can prove it is similar to products already on the market. The FDA said J&J; never applied for this approval before starting to sell its Prolift mesh in 2005 and only got FDA permission in 2008. According to documents seen by Reuters, the FDA also said the label for the device should have included a warning to patients that the mesh’s safety and effectiveness had not been proven in randomized, controlled clinical trials. J&J; said it believed it could sell the device without formal FDA clearance because it was so similar to another approved device, the Gynemesh PS. The company formally applied for FDA 510(k) approval in 2007, and said it always acted “responsibly, appropriately, and consistent with FDA regulations.” FDA spokeswoman Sarah Clark-Lynn said the agency disagreed with J&J;’s initial decision to market Prolift without FDA clearance. But regulators decided to take no action since the company “promptly complied” in seeking approval, once the FDA realized in 2007 that the product was already being sold. Four years after finally receiving formal approval, J&J; said it plans to no longer make the Prolift mesh, or three other Gynecare products: the Prosima Pelvic Floor Repair System, the Prolift+M, Gynemesh M and Gynecare TVT Secur System. The company announced the decision in a letter sent on Monday to a federal judge in West Virginia and a state judge in New Jersey who are overseeing lawsuits about the mesh. J&J; said its decision to stop making the implants was based on “concerns and questions” raised about the devices and their commercial viability, and was not related to the lawsuits or to the implants’ safety or efficacy. “This is not a recall; it’s a global discontinuation,” Ethicon spokesman Johnson said. J&J; said it will continue to sell a related product called Gynecare Gynemesh PS for pelvic organ prolapse, as well as other vaginal devices, including for incontinence. The company said the decision means it should not have to comply with requirements for additional safety studies of the mesh - although it will continue to report to the FDA any complaints, or adverse events, from the devices. The FDA in January sent letters to 35 manufacturers of surgical mesh implants, including J&J;, ordering new safety studies. At the time, the FDA said it might reclassify the devices in a higher-risk category that would require manufacturers to conduct clinical trials in people before receiving approval for sale, rather than clearing them under 510(k). The FDA said it received more than 1,500 reports of complications related to the mesh from 2008 to 2010, including cases where it eroded into the vagina or caused bleeding and infection. The rate of problems was five times the rate reported from 2005 to 2007. Jeffrey Grand, a lawyer at Bernstein Liebhard in New York who represents some women suing the mesh makers, said J&J;’s decision could be an attempt to prevent more lawsuits against its devices and suggests they might be unsafe. “I think the timing of everything is going to make it very hard for them to convince the jury that they don’t believe safety isn’t tied to their decision (to discontinue),” he said. “(And) from our perspective, this is a fantastic development ... We’re happy (the surgical mesh devices) won’t be on the market and hurting more women.” ",6052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jj-mesh/jj-to-halt-sales-of-controversial-vaginal-implants-idUSBRE8541EK20120605

294,JNJ,J&J;'s Stelara success in psoriatic arthritis study,"(Reuters) - Patients taking Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara experienced significant relief from the painful symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis, according to results of a late-stage study. The drug met the main goal of the 615-patient Phase III clinical trial — at least a 20 percent improvement in signs and symptoms of the disease after 24 weeks — at both tested doses compared with a placebo, the data showed. Fifty percent of patients who received 90 milligrams of Stelara and 42 percent who got the 45 mg dose achieved the goal known as ACR 20. That compared with 23 percent of patients in the placebo group who reached ACR 20. The results, which were being presented on Friday at the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) meeting in Berlin, were deemed to be statistically significant, researchers said. “Psoriatic arthritis is something of a calamity for patients who are afflicted,” Professor Iain McInnes, the study’s lead investigator from the University of Glasgow, said in a telephone interview from Berlin. “It’s associated with pain, with stiffness, with loss of function and with high levels of anxiety and psychological stress. There’s a lot of unmet need out there.” Stelara, a biotech drug known chemically as ustekinumab, is already approved to treat the skin condition plaque psoriasis. The new data — the first of two planned Phase III studies — will be used by J&J; to seek expanded approval to treat psoriatic arthritis, a chronic inflammatory condition that causes pain and swelling of the joints and around the tendons. Stelara patients in the study also experienced significant improvements in physical function as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index. Pain and inflammation of sites where tendons and ligaments attach to the bone, known as enthesitis, and of the fingers or toes, called dactylitis, were reduced. The higher dose of Stelara showed statistically significant improvements in the more difficult to achieve measurements ACR 50 and ACR 70. For those who received the 90 mg dose of Stelara, 28 percent of patients achieved ACR 50 and 14.2 percent achieved ACR 70, compared with ACR 50 of 8.7 percent and ACR 70 of 2.4 percent for placebo. Stelara works by blocking interleukin proteins associated with inflammation. Drugs such as J&J;’s Remicade and Abbott Laboratories’ Humira, which have been a mainstay of rheumatoid arthritis treatment and have had success against psoriatic arthritis, block a protein called tumor necrosis factor, or TNF. However, those and older drugs do not work for some patients and can eventually stop helping others after a period of time, McInnes said. He called the Stelara data exciting. “Any new pathway that offers the opportunity to improve the quality of life and the clinical disease in our patients is to be welcomed,” he said. Patients in the study had active psoriatic arthritis, including at least five tender and five swollen joints, despite prior treatment with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug such as methotrexate and/or common anti-inflammatory pain drugs such as ibuprofen. They had not been treated with anti-TNF drugs. Study subjects received injections of either 45 mg or 90 mg of Stelara or a placebo at the start, at week four and then every 12 weeks. The results to be presented on Friday were taken from week 24 of the trial. The study plans to continue to treat and follow these patients for up to two years, J&J; said. Psoriatic arthritis afflicts up to 30 percent of people with psoriasis, according to the National Psoriasis Foundation. It estimates about 7.5 million people in the United States and about 125 million worldwide suffer from psoriasis. Serious side effects were reported in two percent of Stelara-treated patients in the study, which was about the same as in the placebo group. While the J&J; drug can decrease the ability to fight infections or cancer, no malignancies, tuberculosis, serious infections, opportunistic infections, major heart problems or deaths occurred through the placebo-controlled portion, or week 16, of the study, researchers said. One stroke occurred in the Stelara 45 mg group after the placebo-controlled period in a patient with a history of prior stroke and other risk factors, the company said.

The agency also said it might reclassify the devices in a higher-risk category that would require manufacturers to conduct clinical trials in people before receiving approval for sale. Many of the devices are now cleared under a special process known as 510(k) that allows companies to sell the mesh if they can prove it is similar to products already on the market. The FDA said it received more than 1,500 reports of complications related to the mesh from 2008 to 2010, including cases where the it eroded into the vagina or caused bleeding and infection. The rate of problems was five times the rate reported from 2005 to 2007.	   J&J; said it plans to stop sales of the products in all global markets over the next 3 to 9 months on a region-by-region basis. The devices include its Gynecare Prolift Pelvic Floor Repair System, its Gynecare TVT Secur System and its Gynecare Prosima Pelvic Floor Repair System. “This is not a recall; it’s a global discontinuation,” Johnson said. He said J&J; was ending sales of the products largely due to negative overall publicity about vaginal mesh devices, not because of lawsuits against the company. J&J; said it will continue to sell a related product called Gynecare Gynemesh PS for pelvic organ prolapse, as well as other vaginal devices, including for incontinence. Jeffrey Grand, a lawyer at Bernstein Liebhard in New York that represents some women suing the mesh makers, said J&J;’s decision could be an attempt to prevent more lawsuits against its devices and suggests they might be unsafe. “I think the timing of everything is going to make it very hard for them to convince the jury that they don’t believe safety isn’t tied to their decision (to discontinue),” he said. “(And) from our perspective, this is a fantastic development ... We’re happy (the surgical mesh devices) won’t be on the market and hurting more women.”",6052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/jj-mesh/jj-to-stop-selling-controversial-vaginal-implants-idUSL1E8H56QJ20120605
297,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson plans $600 million charge linked to Risperdal sales,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Friday it expects to take a special charge of about $600 million in the second quarter to bolster reserves for a potential settlement of civil lawsuits related to how it marketed schizophrenia treatment Risperdal and other drugs. The hefty charge would also fund potential settlements for litigation involving marketing of Invega, another J&J; schizophrenia treatment, as well as Natrecor, a medicine for congestive heart failure. The money being set aside would also help cover potential settlements involving Omnicare Inc, a pharmacy operator that provides medicines to patients in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Federal investigators have alleged J&J; made illegal payments to Omnicare to purchase and recommend Risperdal for its patients. J&J; is facing a number of lawsuits from states that allege it improperly marketed Risperdal for patients and conditions for which it was not approved by U.S. regulators - including elderly residents of nursing homes. The diversified healthcare company declined to provide further comment about the planned charge, the latest in big set-asides for Risperdal litigation. J&J; in January took a fourth-quarter charge of $3.3 billion, which it said was largely related to ongoing Risperdal lawsuits and investigations. The U.S. Department of Justice for years has been investigating allegations that J&J; marketed the one-time blockbuster medicine for unapproved uses. Federal prosecutors in Washington, D.C., earlier this year nixed a tentative $1 billion settlement with J&J;, holding out for a bigger settlement with the drugmaker, according to published reports. An Arkansas state judge in April ordered J&J; to pay a $1.1 billion penalty after a jury found the company guilty of using fraudulent tactics to sell Risperdal. Arkansas alleges J&J; deceived thousands of doctors in the state by touting the drug as better and safer than rival therapies and marketing it for unapproved uses in children and the elderly.

300,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson diabetes drug tops older therapies in studies,"(Reuters) - An experimental treatment for type 2 diabetes developed by Johnson & Johnson demonstrated greater reduction in blood sugar than Merck & Co’s Januvia and an older common treatment, glimepiride, according to data from a pair of late stage clinical trials. The J&J; drug, canagliflozin, also led to significantly greater weight loss than both of the other drugs and far fewer incidents of hypoglycemia, or potentially dangerous drops in blood sugar levels, than glimepiride, a member of the sulfonylurea class of medicines. Weight loss is an especially attractive effect as obesity is a leading cause of type 2 diabetes and some older medicines cause weight gain. Canagliflozin, belongs to a new class of diabetes treatments called SGLT2 inhibitors that work by blocking reabsorption of glucose by the kidney and increases glucose excretion in the urine to lower blood sugar. The data from the two 52-week studies, presented on Saturday at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) meeting in Philadelphia, are part of a massive approval application J&J; submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week that comprised nine separate Phase III trials involving more than 10,000 patients. If approved it would be the giant healthcare conglomerate’s first diabetes medicine. “There are clearly some unmet needs in diabetes to get glucose control. Hypoglycemia is a big limitation and right now we don’t have effective weight loss therapy, so this class of drugs clearly provides clinical benefits,” said Dr. William Cefalu, the primary researcher on the glimepiride study. “This would be another viable option, another tool in the tool box,” Cefalu said of canagliflozin. In the 755-patient study comparing 300 milligram once-daily canagliflozin to Januvia, the J&J; drug provided statistically significant reductions in A1C levels — a commonly used measure of blood sugar over time. Canagliflozin led an average drop in A1C levels of 1 percent compared with a drop of 0.6 percent for Januvia, a DPP4 inhibitor known chemically as sitagliptin. Some 47 percent of canagliflozin patients got A1C down to the ADA guideline of 7 or less compared with 35 percent of Januvia patients, J&J; said. The J&J; drug led to an average weight loss of 2.5 percent, or about 2.3 kilograms (5 pounds) compared with virtually no impact on weight for the Merck drug. The weight loss for canagliflozin was even more pronounced in the other study. Patients in the study were already taking metformin — the most common first treatment option after diet and exercise fails — and a sulfonylurea. The rate of hypoglycemia was similar and over 40 percent for both groups, likely largely due to the solfonylureas, which have been associated with high rates of hypoglycemia. More patients dropped out of the study due to loss of glycemic control in the Januvia group — 22.5 percent versus 10.6 percent. The rate of serious side effects was low and similar for both drugs, but discontinuation due to serious side effects was higher for canagliflozin — 5.3 percent vs 2.9 percent. The 1,450-patient canagliflozin versus glimepiride trial studied two doses of the J&J; drug — 100 mg and 300 mg — in subjects already on maximally effective doses of metformin. A1C reductions were nearly identical for glimepiride and the lower dose of the J&J; drug. The 300 mg dose proved to be statistically superior with an average A1C reduction of 0.93 pct compared with 0.81 for glimepiride. Glimepiride patients on average added about 1 percent to their weight after 52 weeks. The 100 mg canagliflozin led to a 4.2 percent weight reduction and there was a 4.7 percent weight reduction for 300 mg patients, or a difference of about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) versus the older drug. There was also a big difference in incidence of hypoglycemia in the study. The percentage of patients with at least one episode of hypoglycemia was 4.9 for 300 mg dapagliflozin, 5.6 percent for 300 mg and 34.2 percent for glimepiride. Aside from glucose control, “the other striking thing was the weight loss and the lack of hypoglycemia,” said Cefalu, head of diabetes at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. In both studies, the J&J; drug led to increases in both good and bad cholesterol and a small but favorable decrease in blood pressure. Canagliflozin was also associated with higher rates of genital infections, urinary tract infections and need for increased urination. Researchers, however, did not run into concerns over liver damage that contributed to the FDA rejection of dapagliflozin, a drug from AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb that belongs to the same class as the J&J; drug. “We reported some favorable reduction in liver enzymes,” Cefalu said.

306,JNJ,UPDATE 1-JP Morgan makes rare upgrade on J&J;,"* Raises to “overweight” from “neutral” * Expects company to benefit from recent drug launches * Sees organic revenue growth of 5 pct in H2 of 2012 June 13 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded Johnson & Johnson for the first time in nearly four years, saying the U.S. drugmaker has survived a series of generic versions of its drugs hitting the market and will benefit from recent drug launches. “The good news is that fundamentals are on the upswing at J&J;,” analyst Michael Weinstein said, upgrading the stock to “overweight” - JP Morgan’s top rating. Weinstein, who assigned a “neutral” rating on the stock in October 2008, said J&J; is coming off a difficult 2008 to 2011 period, and expects the company to get a boost from its recently launched advanced prostate cancer drug, Zytiga, hepatitis C treatment, Incivo, and HIV drug, Edurant. Weinstein estimates pharma growth to increase to 10 percent in the second half of the year, from 2.6 percent in the first quarter. Organic revenue growth in the second half of the year will likely surge to 5 percent from 0.9 percent in the first quarter, Weinstein said. “The last time J&J; grew its topline organically anywhere close to 5 percent was 2007 - before the macro meltdown, before 4 of its 5 largest drugs went generic, before (heart stent) Cypher fell to competition, and before (consumer healthcare unit) McNeil stumbled through a series of recalls,” Weinstein wrote in a note to clients. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, Weinstein is rated five stars for the accuracy of his earnings estimates on J&J;, and ranks second out of 22 analysts covering the stock. He raised his price target on the stock to $74 from $69. Separately, Jefferies & Co and Raymond James lifted their ratings on J&J;’s stock, after the company said it expects the $19.7 billion purchase of Swiss medical device maker Synthes to slight boost profit this year. Jefferies now rates the stock “buy,” while Raymond James rates it “outperform”. Johnson & Johnson shares were up 2 percent in premarket trade on Wednesday.

311,JNJ,FDA rejects wider use for J&J;/Bayer's Xarelto,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Thursday that U.S. regulators have declined to approve a new use for its Xarelto blood clot preventer to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Patients with the condition, referred to as ACS, have had heart attacks or chest pains that indicate the risk of a heart attack. Their condition is usually caused by blocked coronary arteries and an estimated 1 million people a year in the United States are hospitalized after having an ACS episode. A panel of outside medical experts to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month recommended against approval of Xarelto for the new indication. The panel said the pill looked promising, but expressed concern about missing clinical-trial data and bleeding risks. Xarelto was approved in the United States late last year to prevent strokes among patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation that is most common among the elderly. It is also approved to reduce risk of blood clots in the legs and lungs of people who have had knee or hip replacement surgery. J&J;, which developed the drug in partnership with German drugmaker Bayer AG, said it is evaluating the FDA’s response, known as a complete response letter. “We will continue to work with the FDA to fully address their questions as quickly as possible,” said Dr. Paul Burton, the cardiovascular franchise medical leader at Janssen R&D;, the division of Johnson & Johnson that makes Xarelto. Xarelto is one of three new medicines that offer potential advantages over older drugs to prevent strokes and other dangerous conditions caused by blood clots. Investors have tried to bet on which of the three will become dominant in a race between Xarelto, Eliquis from Pfizer Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, and Pradaxa from private German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim. Pradaxa gained U.S. approval in 2010 for use in atrial fibrillation, while Eliquis is still under FDA review, with a decision expected by the end of June.

314,JNJ,"UPDATE 1-Bayer, J&J;'s Xarelto gets FDA priority review","FRANKFURT, July 9 (Reuters) - Bayer and Johnson & Johnson’s anti-blood-clotting pill Xarelto won priority review status from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The priority review also includes the drug’s use in the long-term prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients who have already suffered an attack, the German drugmaker and its U.S. partner said on Monday. Thromboembolism is the clogging up of veins, typically in the leg, which is a major risk for bed-ridden or immobile patients. If such a blood clot dislodges and travels to the lungs, it can cause potentially deadly pulmonary embolism, meaning parts of the lungs get cut off from blood supplies. An FDA priority review takes six months rather than the usual 10 to 12-months. Bayer also said it would for now withdraw its request for FDA approval of using Xarelto to cut risk of blood clots developing in heart stents. The request was filed on May 9. The move is linked to a separate request, which it had been forced to rework. U.S. regulators last month declined to approve a new use for Xarelto to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in patients with acute coronary syndrome, and Bayer and J&J; are now working on a renewed application that will also include the use for stent patients. Xarelto is one of three new medicines that offer potential advantages over older drugs to prevent strokes and other dangerous conditions caused by blood clots. Pfizer Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s  Eliquis and private German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa are the other drugs. Stroke prevention in patients with a form of irregular heart beat common among the elderly represents by far the biggest commercial opportunity for the new drugs, which were designed to replace decades-old heart pill warfarin.",7092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/bayer-xarelto-review/update-1-bayer-jjs-xarelto-gets-fda-priority-review-idUSL3E8I939A20120709
315,JNJ,"RPT-INSIGHT-As lawsuits climb, J&J; may have new hip trauma","* J&J;’s Pinnacle all-metal hips shows same problems as recalled device * J&J; refusing to recognize claims -legal experts * Lawsuits could cost J&J; nearly $5 bln if court agrees By Debra Sherman CHICAGO, July 12 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson faces a potentially more damaging and costly sequel to the $3 billion recall of its ASR all-metal artificial hips two years ago, one of the most expensive medical device failures in U.S. history. A successor to ASR, the Pinnacle metal-on-metal hip system has nearly 1,600 lawsuits pending in U.S. courts. Doctors who are tracking large groups of patients with both products estimate that more than 10 percent of the Pinnacle all-metal hips will have failed in the next two to three years. Metal-on-metal hip implants were sold on being more durable than those made of other materials, such as polyethylene or ceramic. They are meant to last up to 15 years, but as controversy over all metal-on-metal implants heats up, fewer surgeons are using them. A survey taken by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in 2010 showed 16 percent of surgeons were using metal-on-metal implants before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned of potential problems. That number dropped to 10 percent since the FDA warning, and doctors say the number probably has dwindled further. Many patients with the Pinnacle metal-on-metal device are experiencing the same problems as those who got the ASR product, including pain and swelling, limited mobility, and dislocation. Perhaps most concerning, some doctors say, is the high levels of cobalt and chromium in the bloodstream resulting from wear of the all-metal implants. Metallosis, as it is known, can lead to cardiovascular, neurological, renal and thyroid problems, in addition to destroying soft tissue, muscle and bone. “We’re simply seeing the tip of the iceberg with metal-on-metal failures,” Dr Mary O’Connor, an orthopedic surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, said of the entire class of metal-on-metal devices. O’Connor said she does not use metal-on-metal hip implants because she has been concerned about metal poisoning for years. The new round of complaints represents a significant threat for J&J;’s DePuy Orthopedics unit, whose Pinnacle line includes non-metal models and covers a much wider range of products than ASR. The diversified healthcare giant, under new Chief Executive Alex Gorsky, has also just raised its bet on orthopedic products with the $20 billion purchase of device maker Synthes. “Litigation is what it is, but the ASR is a very different system and has a very different design and has very different clinical performance” than the Pinnacle, said Mindy Tinsley, a spokeswoman for DePuy. “We recalled it because it was not performing as it should.” She said DePuy is closely monitoring the performance of the Pinnacle metal-on-metal system, but is “very confident” in the product and will vigorously defend itself against lawsuits. DePuy did not make other executives available for comment. DePuy and FDA officials said there is not sufficient evidence linking metal ions in the blood to health risks. A total of 500,000 patients in the United States have received metal-on-metal hips, according to government data. Of those patients, an estimated 150,000 received the Pinnacle  device, and 37,000 got the ASR implant. But while J&J; has set aside $3 billion to settle the 3,000 ASR lawsuits, it is fighting complaints related to the Pinnacle device — meaning that patients with virtually identical problems are facing different financial burdens. Frances Grisham, 50, from Jackson, Tennessee, recently had surgery to repair a fracture to her left hip caused by the ASR implant. She was reimbursed for most of her out-of-pocket expenses and could be eligible for some of the settlement funds. Harriett Bowen, 64, from Salisbury, Maryland, received the Pinnacle all-metal hip in 2008. She soon developed the same symptoms as Grisham: pain, limited mobility and elevated levels of cobalt and chromium in her blood. In July 2011, Bowen’s left hip fractured at the implant site, requiring more surgery. Bowen’s doctor determined she had a cobalt and chromium count of 7 micrograms per liter (mcg/L), a level flagged by UK health authorities as worrying. “He said, ‘Look, we’ve got to get this thing out of you.’ It nearly scared me to death.” Unlike Grisham, she has received no compensation for the repair from J&J.; Bowen is suing J&J.; “I have never done anything like this before, but considering what I went through for three years, I feel like I should be compensated,” said Bowen. PROBLEMS WITH ALL-METAL CITED ACROSS INDUSTRY While other makers of total hip replacement systems — including Smith & Nephew, Zimmer Holdings, Wright Medical and Biomet Inc — face similar complaints, the numbers of devices involved is much smaller. The next most widely used product belongs to Biomet, which is defending itself against lawsuits over its metal-on-metal M2a Magnum Hip System. Legal experts say J&J; is taking a harder line defending itself against Pinnacle metal-on-metal claims, hiring a top product liability defense firm and refusing to recognize patient complaints or pay for replacing the hip devices - known as revision surgery. It maintains the device performs better than other all-metal hip implants. Paul Voorhorst, director of biostatistics and data management at DePuy, told an FDA advisory panel last month that the Pinnacle metal-on-metal device “is performing consistent with or better than other metal-on-metal products.” Should the Pinnacle lawsuits be found to have merit, J&J; could end up paying nearly $5 billion to cover revision surgeries alone, according to plaintiff attorneys. DePuy revenue last year was $5.81 billion, or 9 percent of J&J;’s total. Legal experts not involved in the cases say J&J; probably is just taking its chances to see how the first few lawsuits play out - a common strategy for Big Pharma in major drug litigation cases. They say J&J; may be aided in its defense by the lack of any U.S. program to track the performance of medical devices once they are implanted in people’s bodies. “The last thing plaintiff lawyers want is to go one by one (for each case). With so much unknown, proving cause and effect may be difficult,” said Carl Tobias, Williams professor of law at the University of Richmond School of Law. Cindy Schipani, professor of business law at the University of Michigan, said J&J; could be playing with fire if the Pinnacle metal-on-metal devices are shown to be defective. “They lose credibility if they keep saying they’re not responsible and then it turns out the product is the problem,” she said. “I question this strategy.” While doctors can report problems about the Pinnacle to an FDA database, products with that name also include artificial hips that are not exclusively made of metal. One product is metal-on-polyethylene, the most popular of the Pinnacle devices, and another is metal-on-ceramic. A Reuters search of the database could not isolate adverse events reported for the all-metal Pinnacle, which is the least used of the Pinnacle products. There is also no hard data yet on the Pinnacle’s failure rate, partly because DePuy does not publicly disclose how many were implanted. DePuy’s Voorhorst told the FDA advisory panel that 4 percent to 4.5 percent of these Pinnacle implants require a second surgery to fix the devices within five years after implantation, which is in line with other hip devices. Felecia Stern, an attorney with Bernstein Liebhard LLP, represents Bowen, Grisham and many other patients who received the ASR and Pinnacle all-metal devices. She noted that the recall of 93,000 ASR implants in 2010 led doctors to notify patients and monitor for high metal levels. But problems with the Pinnacle are being reported less systematically since the devices weren’t pulled from the market. “At the end of the day we will see a similar occurrence of high metal levels in Pinnacle metal-on-metal recipients as more and more of them get their blood tested. That is certainly what we are seeing in our client population,” she said. Her firm also serves on the Plaintiffs Steering Committee for the federal Pinnacle lawsuits, which have been consolidated into a multi-district litigation in Texas. The FDA has been monitoring problems with all-metal hip implants and convened the panel of outside advisers last month to discuss their safety. The panel concluded there was little reason for surgeons to use these devices given the risks. In May 2011, the agency ordered device makers to conduct follow-up studies in cases in which an implant’s failure could have serious consequences. Companies would be expected to take blood samples from patients to measure metal ion levels. But more than a year later, the FDA and device manufacturers agreed on study protocols for less than one quarter of the devices. Most of the study plans, including DePuy’s, have not been finalized. “We need more data to better understand how these devices perform,” FDA spokeswoman Michelle Bolek said. “We are open to a more collaborative effort, if it helps us get the data we need.” The final failure rate for the ASR device has not yet been established, but a study released last March by the British Orthopaedic Association and the British Hip Society indicated a failure rate of up to 49 percent after six years - nearly four times the rate cited by DePuy when it recalled the device. Dr David Langton is an orthopedist who has studied all-metal implants for years and supplied the two British organizations with data. He said he expects the ASR failure rate to rise to 80 percent at eight years. Based on a cohort of about 1,000 patients he is tracking at North Tees Hospital in the UK, the Pinnacle metal-on-metal hip has a failure rate of 8 percent at five years. He said that rate climbs to 16 percent after 6-1/2 years. About 150,000 Pinnacle metal-on-metal devices are estimated to be implanted in patients outside the United States. Several differences between the ASR and Pinnacle metal-on-metal could explain a lower failure rate. One main reason is that the Pinnacle has a smaller head; larger heads are associated with higher failure rates because there is more friction. Langton believes it is just be a matter of time before Pinnacle all-metal device failure rates climb, as more metal debris from the implant are released into the bloodstream and tissue. And while the failure rate might be lower than ASR, the absolute number of patients is higher. “We believe the (Pinnacle) failure rate will be far above 10 percent,” said attorney Brian Devine of Seeger Salvas LLP, which is handling both ASR and Pinnacle cases. That would translate into second replacement surgery for 15,000 patients, he said. In 2002, Sulzer Medica AG paid an average of $250,000 per revision on its 2001 recall of its InterOp hip. Adjusting for inflation, an average J&J; settlement could be $319,000 per revision, or $4.785 billion in total, he said. Mayo Clinic’s O’Connor is worried that the entry of metal ions into the bloodstream will damage internal organs, not just the surrounding tissues in the hip socket. There are also concerns high ion levels cause cancer, though that has not been proven. “Autopsy studies of patients with metal-on-metal implants showed metal ions were everywhere the body - in the liver, the spleen, all over the place,” O’Connor said.",7122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/johnsonandjohnson-implants-repeat/rpt-insight-as-lawsuits-climb-jj-may-have-new-hip-trauma-idUSL2E8IBG0W20120712

Most of the study plans, including DePuy’s, have not been finalized. “We need more data to better understand how these devices perform,” FDA spokeswoman Michelle Bolek said. “We are open to a more collaborative effort, if it helps us get the data we need.” The final failure rate for the ASR device has not yet been established, but a study released last March by the British Orthopaedic Association and the British Hip Society indicated a failure rate of up to 49 percent after six years - nearly four times the rate cited by DePuy when it recalled the device. Dr David Langton is an orthopedist who has studied all-metal implants for years and supplied the two British organizations with data. He said he expects the ASR failure rate to rise to 80 percent at eight years. Based on a cohort of about 1,000 patients he is tracking at North Tees Hospital in the UK, the Pinnacle metal-on-metal hip has a failure rate of 8 percent at five years. He said that rate climbs to 16 percent after 6-1/2 years. About 150,000 Pinnacle metal-on-metal devices are estimated to be implanted in patients outside the United States. Several differences between the ASR and Pinnacle metal-on-metal could explain a lower failure rate. One main reason is that the Pinnacle has a smaller head; larger heads are associated with higher failure rates because there is more friction. Langton believes it is just be a matter of time before Pinnacle all-metal device failure rates climb, as more metal debris from the implant are released into the bloodstream and tissue. And while the failure rate might be lower than ASR, the absolute number of patients is higher. “We believe the (Pinnacle) failure rate will be far above 10 percent,” said attorney Brian Devine of Seeger Salvas LLP, which is handling both ASR and Pinnacle cases. That would translate into second replacement surgery for 15,000 patients, he said. In 2002, Sulzer Medica AG paid an average of $250,000 per revision on its 2001 recall of its InterOp hip. Adjusting for inflation, an average J&J; settlement could be $319,000 per revision, or $4.785 billion in total, he said. Mayo Clinic’s O’Connor is worried that the entry of metal ions into the bloodstream will damage internal organs, not just the surrounding tissues in the hip socket. There are also concerns high ion levels cause cancer, though that has not been proven. “Autopsy studies of patients with metal-on-metal implants showed metal ions were everywhere the body - in the liver, the spleen, all over the place,” O’Connor said.",7122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/johnsonandjohnson-implants/insight-as-lawsuits-climb-jj-may-have-new-hip-trauma-idUSL2E8I6CXT20120712

319,JNJ,"UPDATE 3-J&J; hit by strong dollar, CEO eyes pruning units","* Q3 sales slip to $16.48 bln vs $16.69 bln est * EPS excluding items $1.30 vs. $1.29 view * Trims 2012 forecast as dollar swings higher * Shares rise 0.7 percent By Ransdell Pierson July 17 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales and cut its full-year 2012 profit forecast due to the stronger dollar as its new chief executive vowed to be disciplined in paring slow-growing businesses. The diversified healthcare company in April had raised its full-year 2012 profit forecast by about 2 cents per share in the face of a weakening dollar, which raises the value of sales in overseas markets. A stronger dollar is especially punishing to companies like J&J; that derive most sales outside the United States. But J&J; on Tuesday switched gears and trimmed its full-year forecast by 7 to 10 cents per share, citing a turnaround in the dollar’s direction. It now expects $5 to $5.07 per share, little different from its earnings-per-share profit last year of $5. In the face of likely flat earnings this year, new J&J; Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said his top goals include a continuing rebound of the company’s prescription drug business and reintroducing to U.S. drugstores many J&J; over-the-counter medicines that have been recalled in the past three years because of quality-control lapses. They include various versions of painkillers Tylenol and Motrin. “We’re firmly focused on remediation of the over-the-counter business,” he said in a two-hour conference call with industry analysts, referring to ongoing efforts to revamp a Pennsylvania factory where many of the recalled products were made. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said some investors have been hoping that Gorsky, a former company vice chairman who took the helm on April 26, will divest some significant non-pharmaceuticals businesses — following the lead of rivals such as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc. But Conover said Gorsky, in the conference call, suggested he would only be trimming at the edges. “Gorsky’s strategic vision seemed very similar to Bill Weldon,” Conover said, referring to the former J&J; CEO. “His comments suggest he will continue the diversified approach” of offering a wide array of prescription drugs, medical devices and consumer products. Even so, Gorsky suggested he would be open to paring some of J&J;’s slower-growing operations or ones that no longer fit the company’s overall business strategy. “We will be more selective in what areas we’ll be or not be in,” he said during the call. “We have to be more decisive going forward.” J&J; said two late-stage trials of the Alzheimer’s disease treatment it is developing with Pfizer, called bapineuzumab, have been completed and data from them will become available in September. Eli Lilly and Co is expected in coming months to unveil results from Phase III trials of its similar Alzheimer’s medicine. Both drugs work by attacking amyloid protein plaques that build up in the brains of patients with the memory-robbing disease. Researchers on Tuesday released favorable data from a far smaller trial of a different type of Alzheimer’s medicine being developed by Baxter International Inc. In four Alzheimer’s patients taking Baxter’s immune system therapy, the disease was shown to have stabilized for at least three years. Johnson & Johnson earned $1.41 billion, or 50 cents per share, in the second quarter. That compared with $2.78 billion, or $1 per share a year ago. Quarterly sales fell 0.7 percent to $16.48 billion, shy of Wall Street expectations of $16.69 billion. Excluding a number of big charges, J&J; earned $1.30 per share in the most recent period. Analysts, on average, expected $1.29 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. J&J; took charges of $2.2 billion in the most recent quarter related to the writedown of research assets of its Crucell vaccines business, increased litigation costs related to probes of how it marketed its Risperdal schizophrenia drug and costs of its recent acquisition of Swiss medical device maker Synthes. “When viewed altogether, we see J&J;’s performance as solid, and we continue to expect to see a gradual acceleration across all of the core businesses” through the rest of 2012 and into 2013, Sanford Bernstein analyst Derrick Sung said in a research note. J&J;’s international sales slipped 0.4 percent to $9.11 billion, but would have risen 7.1 percent if not for the stronger dollar. Domestic sales fell 1.2 percent to $7.36 billion. Sales in J&J;’s consumer division, hurt by the continuing absence of many of its consumer medicines in the United States, fell 4.6 percent to $3.62 billion. Pharmaceutical sales rose 0.9 percent to $6.29 billion but would have grown 5.1 percent if not for the stronger dollar. Sales were boosted by rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, HIV drug Prezista and prostate cancer treatment Zytiga. Sales of J&J;’s medical devices and diagnostics slipped 0.1 percent to $6.6 billion.

324,JNJ,"Pfizer, J&J; Alzheimer's drug fails one of four big trials","(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Monday that its experimental Alzheimer’s disease treatment failed to prove effective in one of four high-stakes late-stage trials in patients with mild to moderate forms of the memory-robbing disease. The trial involved people who carry a variation of a gene called ApoE4 that makes them far more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease. Pfizer said it and its partner Johnson & Johnson would continue with three other late-stage trials of their medicine, called bapineuzumab, based upon a review by independent safety monitors. The drug failed to improve cognitive and life function, the primary goals of the trial, compared with patients taking placebos. Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. An estimated 5 million Americans are believed to have the disease. An estimated 36 million people worldwide are believed to have dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, Pfizer said. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said he was not surprised by the failure of the bapineuzumab trial, given the especially high-risk patients involved. “When people look at the potential for bapineuzumab, the average expectation out there was about 20 percent that it would be approved,” Conover said. “If it were to do well, people were anticipating that it would do well in the ApoE4 non carriers, so the odds of this one being successful were even lower.” Pfizer said in a statement that a serious side effect of treatment appeared to be edema, or swelling in the brain, as detected by magnetic resonance imaging. The same side effect was seen in mid-stage trials of bapineuzumab, prompting researchers to shift patients to smaller doses of the drug in far larger Phase III trials. The failed North American trial was supervised by J&J;, which is also heading another Phase III trial in North America involving patients who do not carry the ApoE4 gene variation. Pfizer is conducting a pair of overseas Phase III trials, also involving both ApoE4 carriers and non-carriers. Bapineuzumab, an injectable monoclonal antibody, works by attacking a protein called beta-amyloid that is believed by many researchers to be a leading cause of Alzheimer’s disease. Most industry analysts have held out little hope that the Pfizer/J&J; drug or a similar one being developed by Eli Lilly and Co called solanezumab would succeed in their primary goals of improving cognitive and life function. That is because patients in all the studies already have symptoms and therefore have brain damage that would be difficult to reverse. Many are holding out hope, however, that bapineuzumab and solanezumab may provide some secondary benefits, such as delaying loss of memory, especially in patients with mildest symptoms. In that case, the drugs might have potential for blockbuster sales because current medicines do not appreciably slow progression of the disease. Data from the failed trial and from the companion J&J-led; study of ApoE4 noncarriers is scheduled to be presented in September at a meeting of the European Federation of Neurological Societies in Stockholm. Limited data from the two trials is expected to be released by Pfizer before the meeting. “While we are disappointed in the results of this first study, the Phase 2 (mid-stage) trials suggested that ApoE4 non-carriers may have a better chance of benefiting from bapineuzumab than ApoE4 carriers,” J&J; said in a statement.

The companies said they would discontinue all other studies of the drug bapineuzumab, including two more late stage trials and follow-up extension studies, in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s. The result marked the second such failure announced in recent weeks and was especially disappointing as bapineuzumab had been given a better chance of success in the patients studied in the second trial.

Vivus shares rose 8 percent in early morning trade. Lazard’s Joshua Schimmer became the second analyst — after Cowen & Co’s Simos Simeonidis — to defend sales prospects of Qsymia, after short-seller Citron Research cast doubts on Vivus’s ability to protect its weight-loss pill’s patents. Schimmer noted no threat to the launch of the weight-loss pill from a Johnson & Johnson patent on the use of one of its key ingredients, topiramate. The analyst said the most likely scenario was a royalty stream payment to Johnson & Johnson to resolve the patent issue. The brokerage also set a price target of $36 on the stock, citing the large patient population and the drug’s safety profile. Schimmer said he does not expect any hold-up in sales of the product from lack of reimbursement. “More plans will reimburse for obesity drugs to manage the downstream costs associated with diabetes and other co-morbidities of obesity,” he said in a note to clients. Vivus shares, which fell as much as 15 percent the day Citron published its report, were up 6 percent at $22.61 on the Nasdaq.

The famed money manager also cut three of his firm’s biggest holdings sharply in the quarter that ended June 30, regulatory filings on Tuesday reveal. Berkshire reduced its position in Procter & Gamble by nearly 20 percent, cut its stake in Kraft by a quarter and slashed its position in Johnson & Johnson by roughly two-thirds. In February, Buffett said he might sell more J&J; stock, given the company’s issues with product recalls. Berkshire’s big move into oil was engineered by investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who directed the company to accumulate more than 28 million shares of Phillips 66 , a ConocoPhillips spin-off. With the big equity stake, Berkshire may now rank as one of Phillips 66’s largest shareholders. Berkshire also has a stake in ConocoPhillips of nearly 28.9 million shares, down slightly from the first quarter. Buffett said in July that Combs and Weschler had been accumulating a position in the refiner. At the same time he revealed the portfolios they manage had been increased to $4 billion each. Combs and Weschler also took a stake of just over 2.8 million shares in top oilfield equipment maker National Oilwell Varco, just enough to be among that stock’s top 30 holders. Berkshire deepened its bet on a Buffett favorite, Wells Fargo, raising its position by 4 percent. The investment company also raised its stake in International Business Machines Corp by 3.5 percent. Berkshire’s team also increased its stake in media conglomerate Viacom in the second quarter, while selling out of a relatively recent stake in chipmaker Intel . There were a number of moves in financials as well, as Berkshire’s position in payments processor Visa fell 27 percent and its stake in financial data company Verisk Analytics  declined 16 percent. At the same time Berkshire raised its investment in BNY Mellon. Other changes in the quarter included sharply increased stakes in Weschler’s old favorite DaVita, a provider of dialysis, as well as in DirecTV, and a 25 percent reduction in CVS Caremark.

The recall, which has been classified as Class I, or the most serious type of recall, was initiated on July 5.

338,JNJ,FDA approves wider use for J&J; Nucynta ER pain drug,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson unit Janssen Pharmaceuticals said on Wednesday it received U.S. regulatory approval for a wider use of its Nucynta ER painkiller, for pain from nerve damage brought on by diabetes. Nucynta ER, an opioid, is already approved for extended use in moderate to severe chronic pain. But the expanded approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows Janssen to market the drug for pain tied to diabetic peripheral neuropathy, which affects up to 8 million Americans. Some studies estimate that nearly half of all people with diabetes have some form of peripheral neuropathy, which can cause stinging or burning sensations, pain, numbness or weakness in the hands and feet, and is a major cause of amputations. Janssen said only two other drugs were approved for pain related to the condition, but Nucynta ER is the first approved opioid. Sales of the non-extended release version of Nucynta were $140 million in 2011 and are expected to reach $600 million in 2016, according to the average forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The company did not immediately provide sales figures for Nucynta ER. The FDA and other health officials have recently warned about the potential for abuse with opioids — synthetic versions of opium that can be highly addictive, especially when taken over a long period of time. Some researchers have said aggressive marketing by drug companies has fueled overprescribing of opioids like oxycodone and methadone. In a statement announcing the approval, Janssen said it was committed to teaching doctors, patients and others about the responsible use of pain-killers and the prevention of misuse. Nucynta’s common side effects include nausea, constipation, vomiting, dizziness, headaches and drowsiness. Like some other opioids, the twice-daily pill in rare cases may also cause life-threatening respiratory depression. Johnson & Johnson shares were down 0.14 percent at $67.37 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

343,JNJ,J&J; to pay $181 million to settle improper marketing claims,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said it has agreed to pay $181 million to settle consumer fraud claims by 36 U.S. states and the District of Columbia that it improperly marketed its Risperdal antipsychotic drug for unapproved uses. The diversified healthcare company has also been targeted by federal authorities for separate but related allegations, including improperly promoting the drug for use in nursing homes. J&J; said it had already set aside funds to cover the civil settlement. The funds will be divided among the states participating in the settlement, announced on Thursday. The company said the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing. “We have chosen this path to achieve a prompt and full resolution of these state claims,” Michael Yang, president of J&J;’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals, said in a statement. Annual sales of Risperdal, which topped $4 billion at their peak, have dwindled in the face of competition from cheaper generic versions. J&J; said it would not promote any of its newer antipsychotics for off-label uses or make any false or misleading claims related to those products. It said it had a system in place to ensure that marketing and promotion policies are followed. While doctors are free to use medicines in any way they see fit, companies can only promote drugs for uses approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. J&J; previously disclosed a separate agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice to settle three civil False Claims Act matters pending in U.S. courts involving sales and marketing of Risperdal, another schizophrenia treatment, Invega, and the heart failure drug Natrecor.

It said it was unclear when the agreement with the Justice Department would become final. The latest settlement follows a number of costly court setbacks in various states related to Risperdal sales practices. In April, an Arkansas state judge ordered J&J; to pay a $1.1 billion penalty after a jury found the company guilty of using fraudulent tactics to sell Risperdal. J&J; filed an appeal of that ruling in July. Arkansas sued the company, saying it had deceived thousands of doctors by touting the medicine as better and safer than rival therapies and marketing it for unapproved uses in children and the elderly. The state, which was not part of the settlement announced on Thursday, alleged that J&J; caused its Medicaid insurance program for the poor to greatly overpay for Risperdal. The company earlier agreed to pay $158 million to settle a similar lawsuit brought by Texas. It is appealing decisions that went against it in Louisiana and South Carolina.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in June declined to approve the new use and issued a so-called complete response letter demanding more information after advisors had expressed concern about bleeding risks. Patients with ACS have had heart attacks or chest pains that indicate the risk of a heart attack. Their condition is usually caused by blocked coronary arteries and an estimated 1 million people a year in the United States are hospitalized after having an ACS episode. Bayer also said on Friday it renewed its application for the combined use of Xarelto with standard antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of stent thrombosis in patients with ACS. Xarelto was approved in the United States late last year to prevent strokes among patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation that is most common among the elderly.

The regional business group honored Johnson as part of its annual “New Englander of the Year” awards at the Seaport Hotel/World Trade Center in Boston. “I was raised to believe that New England is the best place on the planet,” Johnson said. It was her first public appearance since Fidelity in August promoted her to run all of the company’s main businesses. Johnson reports to her 82-year-old father, Edward C. Johnson III, Boston-based Fidelity’s chairman and chief executive since 1977. He did not attend the ceremony. Fidelity manages $1.6 trillion in assets and is the second-largest U.S. mutual fund company behind Vanguard Group. Fidelity’s stock mutual funds have been hurt by investors pulling money out of the investments while showing preference for exchange-traded funds and other passive investments. But on Thursday night, Johnson said it was a time to celebrate New England. She talked, for example, about how New England has the “best plants, the best grass .. and all that good stuff.” Johnson told an audience of more than 1,000 people how Fidelity’s fixed-income operations in New Hampshire are world class and visited by powerhouse Wall Street firms and families of bears who like to “nibble on goodies in the woods.” ",10052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fund-fidelity-johnson/fidelitys-new-president-talks-of-bears-shows-whimsical-side-idUSBRE8940YD20121005

354,JNJ,"J&J; profit beats as newer drugs, devices deliver","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson reported better-than-expected third-quarter results on Tuesday, as newer drugs, including a treatment for prostate cancer, led a rebound in sales and investor jitters about medical device sales proved unfounded. J&J;, whose products span artificial hips and over-the-counter painkillers like Tylenol, is showing signs of dependable sales growth after several years of navigating costly product recalls and the loss of patent protection on major brand-name drugs. Its performance has been helped by the launch of prescription drugs like Zytiga for prostate cancer and Incivek for hepatitis C, which it sells abroad under license from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, as well as the nearly $20 billion purchase of Swiss medical device maker Synthes earlier this year. “Things can’t help but look more positive for the company with today’s results,” said Piper Jaffray analyst Matt Miksic, who noted it was the first time in a year that J&J; had beaten Wall Street sales estimates. Earnings per share before special items topped expectations, and revenue also beat Wall Street estimates. For a graphic, see: link.reuters.com/wef43t Third-quarter global sales of prescription drugs jumped 7 percent to $6.4 billion, helped by Zytiga and double-digit gains for cancer, arthritis, psoriasis and HIV treatments. That compared with drug-sales growth of less than 1 percent in the prior quarter. Miksic said investors had feared that sales of J&J;’s medical devices and diagnostics would sink in the quarter after Edwards Lifesciences Corp earlier this month warned of weaker-than-expected heart valve sales, spurring fears of a fresh slowdown in demand for the broader industry. Global sales of J&J;’s medical device business rose 12.5 percent to $7.1 billion, helped by the addition of revenue from Synthes devices. Excluding the Synthes contribution and the negative impact of a stronger dollar, J&J;’s underlying device sales were nearly flat. “Investors were concerned there would be a softening of demand for devices,” Miksic said, especially in Europe, “but there was no evidence of that.” Shares in J&J; were up 1.3 percent, in line with the broader ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of U.S. and European drugmakers. Since the beginning of the year, company shares have risen about 6 percent, underperforming a 16.5 percent jump for the industry index. J&J; said sales of consumer products slipped 4.3 percent to $3.6 billion as dozens of over the counter medicines, including children’s Tylenol and Motrin painkillers, remained unavailable or in short supply due to recalls over the past three years linked to quality control lapses. The company is making costly upgrades to its consumer healthcare plants in the United States under federal supervision and has said it hopes to restore many brands to store shelves this year and next. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said he does not expect the factories to reach full production until 2014, an overhang that has kept many investors at bay. But he was encouraged by improving trends for J&J;’s other businesses. “We’re starting to see an overall inflection point in company sales growth, with pharmaceuticals leading the charge,” he said. The company earned $3.0 billion, or $1.05 per share, in the third quarter, compared with $3.2 billion, or $1.15 per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, J&J; earned $1.25 per share. Analysts, on average, expected $1.21 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 6.5 percent to $17.1 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $16.97 billion. Sales would have risen 10.8 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which hurts the value of revenues in overseas markets. J&J; slightly raised its full-year profit forecast to between $5.05 and $5.10 per share, excluding items, from $5.00 to $5.07 per share.

Dow components Johnson & Johnson and UnitedHealth Group, both raised their full-year profit views while Goldman Sachs boosted its dividend. J&J;, the diversified healthcare company, rose 0.7 percent to $69.11 while UnitedHealth, the largest health insurer, fell 0.4 percent to $57.24 after rallying in premarket trading. Goldman shares slipped 0.5 percent to $123.63 after posting earnings that beat expectations and revenue that more than doubled. “Not only have the Dow components done very well today, but Goldman is extremely positive,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer at Sarhan Capital in New York. “That a financial is able to have results like that in this kind of low-growth environment bodes well for the economy as a whole.” The Dow Jones industrial average was up 59.80 points, or 0.45 percent, at 13,484.03. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 6.30 points, or 0.44 percent, at 1,446.43. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 9.94 points, or 0.32 percent, at 3,074.12. Coca-Cola Co also reported a rise in earnings, but  quarterly revenue came in short of Wall Street expectations, hurt by declines in Europe and Asia. Its shares fell 1 percent to $37.59. Citigroup unexpectedly announced that Chief Executive Vikram Pandit had resigned effective immediately, along with Chief Operating Officer John Havens. Michael Corbat, previously chief executive for Europe, Middle East and Africa, was named to succeed Pandit. The announcement came one day after a surprisingly strong quarterly earnings report. Citi’s shares rose 1 percent to $37.10. “Pandit is leaving at the top of the game and leaving the company in great hands, but the timing of the move is shocking,” Sarhan said. “Why they didn’t announce it with the earnings is a question that needs to be answered.” The quarterly earnings season thus far has been mixed, with some early pessimistic results giving the S&P; 500 its worst week since June last week. However, Citigroup’s results helped spark a rally on Monday. Profits of S&P; 500 companies are seen dropping 2.5 percent from the year-ago period, according to Thomson Reuters data. With about 8 percent of S&P; companies having reported, 61 percent have topped profit expectations, under the average beat rate of 67 percent for the past four quarters. Intel and IBM report after the market closes and are among the first major earnings reports of the tech sector, which has been marked by a number of profit warnings, including from Intel. IBM shares rose 0.4 percent to $209.91 while Intel rose 3 percent to $22.38. U.S. consumer prices rose 0.6 percent in September as the cost of gasoline surged, while industrial output was up 0.4 percent in September. Wall Street was little influenced by the data. While earnings have been the primary driver for equities in recent sessions, overshadowing some strong economic indicators, investors will keep an eye on the meeting of European leaders later this week. European shares rose 0.9 percent on growing hopes the meeting would advance plans to tackle debt problems in Spain and Greece.",10162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-wall-st-gains-on-strong-earnings-from-goldman-jj-idUSL1E8LG6Z820121016

Crucell was not immediately available for comment.

The expanded approval will allow doctors to use Xarelto as an alternative to a widely used injectable treatment called enoxaparin. The pill is already approved to reduce the risk of such leg clots, called deep vein thrombosis, and lung clots, following knee or hip replacement surgery. It is also already approved to prevent strokes in patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. The FDA said it granted the expanded approval based on safety and effectiveness of Xarelto seen in three clinical trials involving more than 9,000 patients with deep vein thrombosis or lung clots.

Many of the investment decision were made not by Buffett himself but by his two investment managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs. Buffett has said only the changes in Berkshire’s biggest positions, like adding to holdings of Wells Fargo , were made by him. The portfolio was again volatile this quarter, with a number of large moves in a wide variety of stocks. While Buffett is the exemplar of buy-and-hold investing, he has indicated that at least one of the team of Weschler and Combs is inclined to trade more actively from quarter to quarter. Berkshire took new stakes in Deere, the world’s largest agricultural equipment maker, as well as Precision Castparts, whose castings are used in every jet aircraft engine program in production or under development. It also took a position in Wabco Holdings, which makes braking and transmission products for the commercial truck market, and raised its stake by 50 percent in the automaker General Motors. At the same time, Berkshire sold two stocks that were relatively new to the portfolio, CVS Caremark and Dollar General. It cut its long-time holding in Johnson & Johnson by 95 percent and also trimmed its Procter & Gamble position by another 11 percent. J&J; was one of Berkshire’s biggest investments by valuation over the last five years, but Buffett has been selling it aggressively this year, telling CNBC in February the company “has messed up in a lot of ways” in the recent past. Berkshire was also active in media stocks during the quarter. In addition to a new stake in Media General, tied to Berkshire’s acquisition of that company’s newspapers, the conglomerate increased its position in Viacom and sold some of its relatively new holdings in newspaper operator Lee Enterprises. Buffett’s company made a number of investments in financial stocks as well, adding to positions in his favorite bank Wells Fargo and also BNY Mellon even as it sold some holdings in Visa Inc and U.S. Bancorp. In the second quarter, Berkshire made big bets on the refiner Phillips 66 and the oilfield equipment maker National Oilwell Varco. It raised the National Oilwell stake again in the third quarter, while cutting its position in former Phillips 66 parent ConocoPhillips.",11142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshirehathaway-holdings/buffetts-berkshire-sheds-consumer-stocks-buys-industrials-in-3rd-qtr-idUSL1E8ME6B520121114

366,JNJ,FDA advisory panel backs efficacy of J&J; TB drug,"(Reuters) - An advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday voted that data suggest an experimental Johnson & Johnson drug for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is effective, the drugmaker said. The medicine, called bedaquiline, is a member of a new class of drugs that target adenosine triphosphate synthase, an enzyme the tuberculosis bacterium needs to generate its energy. J&J; said the panel of outside medical experts, in a vote of 18 to 0, found that trial data support the efficacy of bedaquiline in adults, taken in combination with standard treatments. In September, the FDA granted priority review of the medicine, based on data from two mid-stage trials that tested it among patients with tuberculosis that is resistant to standard drugs. J&J; is hoping the agency will grant accelerated approval of the drug, on the basis of favorable data from mid-stage trials. The company plans to begin a larger Phase 3 study in the fourth quarter. In a pair of completed Phase 2 trials, two doses of the medicine were tested for 24 weeks, in combination with standard treatments, followed by continuation of standard therapy for a year to 18 months. The planned larger trial will involve nine months of treatment with bedaquiline, in combination with standard drugs, compared with standard drugs alone for the same period. The total nine-month treatment period would be far shorter than the current 18- to 24-month treatment period for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis drugs recommended by the World Health Organization, J&J; said. Cowen and Co has forecast peak annual sales of $300 million for bedaquiline, which would make it a fairly modest product for the diversified healthcare company. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is caused by strains of the bacterium that have become resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most potent drugs for TB. Resistance to anti-TB drugs can occur when they are misused or mismanaged, for instance when patients don’t complete their full course of treatment or when doctors prescribe the wrong treatment, wrong dose or length of time taking the drugs. An estimated 8.7 million people in 2011 fell ill with tuberculosis - which is spread by coughing and sneezing — while 1.4 million died from the disease, according to the World Health Organization.

It backed the drug’s safety, by a vote of 11 to 7. The FDA usually follows the advice of its advisory panels when deciding whether to approve new medicines. In September, the FDA granted priority review of the drug, based on data from two mid-stage trials that tested it among patients with tuberculosis that is resistant to standard drugs. J&J;’s Janssen drug subsidiary is hoping the agency will grant accelerated approval of its drug, on the basis of favorable data from mid-stage trials. The company plans to begin a larger Phase 3 study early next year. In a pair of completed Phase 2 trials, two doses of the medicine were tested for 24 weeks, in combination with standard treatments, followed by continuation of standard therapy for a year to 18 months. In one of the trials, 10 deaths were seen among 79 people taking bedaquiline and standard drugs, compared with only 2 deaths among 81 patients taking only standard drugs. Some members of the FDA advisory panel expressed concern about that “mortality imbalance,” as well as elevated liver enzymes — a potential sign of liver toxicity — among patients taking the J&J; drug. Patients taking bedaquiline also had increases in the so-called QT interval — suggesting a possible electrical irregularity in the heart — than those not taking the medicine. But Wim Parys, Janssen’s head of development for infectious disease medicines, said in an interview that the drug’s superiority to standard medicines in the mid-stage trials held sway with the advisory panel. He said 21 percent fewer patients taking the J&J; drug still had signs of the TB bacterium in their sputum after one of the mid-stage studies, than those taking just standard drugs. “This is a new mechanism of action to treat TB, particularly (bacteria) that have become resistant to first-line treatments,” Parys said. Cowen and Co has forecast peak annual sales of $300 million for bedaquiline, which would make it a fairly modest product for the diversified healthcare company. Parys acknowledged the drug’s limited sales potential, given that it would be used mainly in poorer developing countries. But he said J&J; approved development of the medicine due to a compelling medical need. The planned larger trial will involve nine months of treatment with bedaquiline, in combination with standard drugs, compared with standard drugs alone for the same period. The total nine-month treatment period would be far shorter than the current 18- to 24-month treatment period for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis drugs recommended by the World Health Organization, J&J; said. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is caused by strains of the bacterium that have become resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most potent drugs for TB. Resistance to anti-TB drugs can occur when they are misused or mismanaged, for instance when patients don’t complete their full course of treatment or when doctors prescribe the wrong treatment, wrong dose or length of time taking the drugs. An estimated 8.7 million people in 2011 fell ill with tuberculosis - which is spread by coughing and sneezing — while 1.4 million died from the disease, according to the World Health Organization. About 310,000 cases of multidrug-resistant TB were reported the same year, the organization said, with almost 60 percent in India, China and Russia.

371,JNJ,J&J; says it won't enforce AIDS drug patent in Africa,"LONDON (Reuters) - Generic manufacturers are to be given a free rein to make cheap copies of Johnson & Johnson’s HIV/AIDS drug Prezista for sale in Africa and other poor countries.

376,JNJ,FDA OKs J&J; prostate cancer drug for pre-chemo use,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Monday expanded the approval of Johnson & Johnson’s drug Zytiga for advanced prostate cancer to allow its use prior to treatment with chemotherapy. The widely-expected, expanded Food and Drug Administration approval, which came after the company demonstrated that Zytiga could extend survival if used prior to chemotherapy, is likely to significantly boost sales of the new medicine. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Larry Biegelsen, in a research note earlier this year, forecast peak Zytiga sales of $2.3 billion in 2016, with about 70 percent coming from pre-chemo use. Zytiga was originally approved in April 2011 for use in combination with the steroid prednisone to treat men whose prostate cancer had progressed following treatment with the chemotherapy drug docetaxel. The pill, which works by decreasing production of the hormone testosterone that fuels cancer growth, had sales of about $800 million in its first year of availability, capturing some 60 percent of the post-chemotherapy market. That market share is likely to shrink due to new competition in the post-chemotherapy setting from Xtandi, which is sold by Medivation Inc and Astellas Pharma Inc, analysts said. Xtandi is still undergoing late stage trials in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy treatment and the drug could be a year or two away from a similar expanded approval. However, Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said Xtandi was likely to gain some “off label” use in pre-chemo patients. The term refers to doctors prescribing drugs for none-approved uses. “Ultimately we are convinced that Xtandi will get a comparable or better label expansion by mid 2014,” he said. Meanwhile, Zytiga patients starts will get “an immediate boost,” Porges added. In late stage clinical trials of more than 1,000 patients with advanced prostate cancer who had not been treated with chemotherapy, those who received Zytiga on average lived more than five months longer than those who received a placebo. “Today’s approval demonstrates the benefit of further evaluating a drug in an earlier disease setting and provides patients and health care providers the option of using Zytiga earlier in the course of treatment,” Richard Pazdur, director of the Office of Oncology Drug Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. The American Cancer Society estimated that more than 28,000 U.S. men will die from prostate cancer in 2012, making it the second leading cause of cancer death behind lung cancer.

380,JNJ,U.S. approves J&J; drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators have approved a new Johnson & Johnson drug for patients with tuberculosis who do not respond to other treatments, the company said. The drug is the first in 40 years to tackle the disease using a new mechanism of action, according to J&J.; The drug blocks an energy-producing enzyme that tuberculosis bacteria need to survive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, chemically known as bedaquiline and to be marketed as Sirturo, on Monday following a positive review by an advisory panel last month. Tuberculosis is an air-spread infection that usually attacks the lungs but it can also affect the brain, the spine and the kidneys. In 2011, nearly 9 million people around the world became sick with TB, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and there were 1.4 million TB-related deaths. The disease requires six to nine months of drug treatment. TB is more prevalent now than at any time in history, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg wrote in a blog on the FDA website. This drug will help treat and cure patients who are putting themselves and others at serious health risk, she said. The drug itself has significant potential risks, she wrote, and will carry a warning about an increased rate of death observed in patients who received it. Her comments followed those of the FDA advisers who found the drug to be effective, though they noted that more deaths were seen in the group of patients who took bedaquiline in combination with standard treatments than in the group that took standard drugs alone. Doctors Without Borders said that the drug was a “potential game changer” against drug-resistant forms of the disease and an important milestone in fighting TB. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is caused by strains of the bacterium that have become resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampin, the two most potent drugs for TB. Support has not been unanimous. Consumer advocacy group Public Citizen earlier this month said it had written to the FDA because of the risks of death asking it not to approve of the drug, which received a fast approval. Chrispin Kambili, medical affairs leader for bedaquiline at J&J;’s Janssen Therapeutics unit, said in a recent interview that the company is studying the difference in death rates but has so far seen no common pattern. Almost every death was due to a different cause, including a motor vehicle accident. What was unusual, he said, was the low rate of death in the placebo group. Advisers to the FDA expressed concern that a greater number of patients had elevated liver enzymes, a potential sign of liver toxicity, and elongated QT levels, an electrical irregularity in the heart that can cause sudden death. But Kambili said none of the patients died due to serious QT prolongation and there was no unifying findings in the data. Kambili said J&J;’s drug is designed for a relatively small portion of patients - some 650,000 - who do not respond to existing therapies. And while investment analysts at Cowen and Co have forecast peak annual sales of the product at a relatively modest $300 million, the drug is important from a public health standpoint, Kambili said.

384,JNJ,CVS stops putting Tylenol in some stores to end supply holes,"Jan 14 (Reuters) - If you cannot find Tylenol pain reliever at your local CVS store this flu season, it might be because that store is no longer stocking it. CVS this month changed how it stocks Tylenol at its stores in the wake of manufacturing problems at the drug’s maker, Johnson & Johnson, that have disrupted supplies for more than three years. Under the new plan, CVS will try to have Tylenol in stores in each market, but will not have it in every store, spokesman Michael DeAngelis said. The company is getting enough Tylenol to stock about half of its 7,400 U.S. stores, and it changed the stocking of Tylenol to eliminate empty spots on shelves where the medication would have been. The move by the drugstore unit of CVS Caremark Corp, the second largest such unit in the United States, could be a sign of the difficulty J&J; faces as it tries to fix quality-control problems and rebuild its Tylenol business. A spokesman for J&J;’s McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit, which makes Tylenol, did not return Reuters’ calls seeking comment. Since 2009, faulty manufacturing has prompted J&J;’s McNeil unit to recall millions of bottles and packages of Tylenol, Benadryl, Motrin and other over-the-counter medicines. At the same time, CVS and other retailers have been putting more emphasis on their private-label products, which cost less than brand-name products but can be more profitable for retailers. The length of time it has taken for J&J; to upgrade its factories and ramp up manufacturing of Tylenol has given consumers plenty of time to try the store brand and decide whether they want to pay more for Tylenol, Stephanie Prymas, Consumer health analyst at market data researcher Euromonitor International, said. “That’s a pretty long time for private-label to gain some credibility,” Prymas said. In 2009, before the recalls started, Tylenol had 56 percent of the U.S. market share for acetaminophen, the chemical name of Tylenol, according to Euromonitor. In 2012, that was down to 24 percent. At the same time, private-label market share has grown from 32 percent to 62 percent. Prymas said that private-label products are more accepted now than 20 years ago, when deaths linked to cyanide-tainted capsules caused Tylenol to be pulled from store shelves. Private-label offerings are now more commonplace and trusted, she said. “We’re kind of expecting private label to hold on more tenaciously to what they have captured,” Prymas said. A visit to a CVS store on Chicago’s North Side on Sunday showed no obvious signs that Tylenol extra strength pain reliever for adults had ever been on the shelves or any spaces for the medication had to be restocked. Instead, the shelves were well-stocked with the CVS brand. DeAngelis declined to say whether the supply of Tylenol had changed in recent weeks to prompt the new distribution plan. A spokesman for Walgreen Co, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, said that company has seen no change in its supply of Tylenol products.",1142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/cvs-tylenol/cvs-stops-putting-tylenol-in-some-stores-to-end-supply-holes-idUSL2N0AJENP20130114
385,JNJ,J&J; negotiating possible $2 billion implant settlement: Bloomberg,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is negotiating a potential $2 billion settlement with patients who received its recalled artificial hip implant, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing five people familiar with the matter. J&J; has offered to pay more than $200,000 per case, a deal that could top $2 billion if most plaintiffs accept the terms, but lawyers for the hip recipients have so far rejected the offer as too low, the sources said. The settlement talks are likely to continue at least until the first trials of lawsuits over the product start next week, Bloomberg said. Lorie Gawreluk, a spokeswoman for J&J;’s DePuy unit, which made the implants, said the company was unable to discuss details of its litigation strategy. “The company will defend itself against the allegations raised in the lawsuits, and DePuy believes the evidence to be presented at trial will show the company acted appropriately and responsibly,” she said in an email. DePuy recalled its ASR all-metal hip system in 2010 after it failed at a higher-than-expected rate, with some patients experiencing pain, swelling, joint dislocation and sometimes systemic damage to the central nervous system, thyroid and heart. On Thursday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a proposal calling on companies that make all-metal hip replacements to provide additional information proving they are safe and effective before being allowed to continue selling them.

Lorie Gawreluk, a spokeswoman for J&J;’s DePuy unit, which made the implants, said the company was unable to discuss details of its litigation strategy. “The company will defend itself against the allegations raised in the lawsuits, and DePuy believes the evidence to be presented at trial will show the company acted appropriately and responsibly,” she said in an email. DePuy recalled its ASR all-metal hip system in 2010 after it failed at a higher-than-expected rate, with some patients experiencing pain, swelling, joint dislocation and sometimes systemic damage to the central nervous system, thyroid and heart. On Thursday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a proposal calling on companies that make all-metal hip replacements to provide additional information proving they are safe and effective before being allowed to continue selling them.

387,JNJ,J&J; mulls sale of diagnostics unit,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson may sell or spin off its slow-growing $2 billion-a-year diagnostics business, the company said on Tuesday when it reported quarterly earnings. The diversified healthcare company said it may sell the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics business - whose products include equipment for laboratory diagnostics and blood transfusion screening - or turn it into a stand-alone company. The decision comes as drugmakers are shedding businesses and cutting costs due to overseas price controls and pressure on payments from insurers and the government. Pfizer Inc, for instance, is spinning off its animal health products business, and Abbott Laboratories has split off its drugs unit. Debbie Wang, an analyst with Morningstar, said the J&J; diagnostics unit “is a slower grower, and if you’re not one of the leaders, it’s very difficult to compete in that area.” Les Funtleyder, a fund manager at Poliwogg, said the company is wise to consider exiting this low-tech diagnostic business. J&J; should target the more high-tech, high-profit molecular diagnostics business, which entails sophisticated genetic analysis used by physicians to tailor treatment to individual patients, he said. This is becoming more of a mainstay in medical treatment, especially in cancer, where numerous gene mutations make patients vulnerable to disease. “If you look five years down the road, we are going to see molecular diagnostics and gene sequencing converge,” Funtleyder said in an interview at the J&J; analyst meeting in New York. He added that gene sequencing - a process that looks for certain genes, and gene mutations especially, that predispose a person to certain diseases - will become the main determinant of how physicians treat patients. Funtleyder said he thinks J&J; should consider acquiring companies like Illumina Inc or Life Technologies Corp, both engaged in genetic analysis. But Andy Busser, a fund manager for Symphony Capital in New York, thinks moving into molecular diagnostics may not be likely. “At the end of the day, they might prefer to invest that capital elsewhere.” Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, whose revenue growth has been relatively flat, is No. 5 in the clinical diagnostics market, as measured in sales. Typically, J&J;’s businesses rank first or second in their respective markets. Clinical diagnostics is less attractive than molecular diagnostics, which might see near double-digit revenue growth in coming years, according to analysts. It might be easier to sell Ortho Clinical Diagnostics to a private equity buyer, Funtleyder said. “They might be satisfied with a dependable if not an exciting business.” J&J;, which made the disclosure as it reported stronger-than-expected earnings, said it was in the very early stages of examining options. J&J; said it earned $1.19 per share, excluding one-time items, in the fourth quarter, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.17. A favorable tax rate and cost controls boosted results, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Matt Miksic. He also cited very strong growth in sales of J&J;’s traditional artificial hips and of artificial knees, whose combined U.S. sales rose 7 percent despite disruptions from Superstorm Sandy in the quarter. Including a charge of $800 million, related mostly to recalls of defective “metal-on-metal” hip replacement devices made by its DePuy Orthopedics unit, J&J; earned $2.6 billion, or 91 cents per share. That compared with $218 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier, when the company took charges of more than $3 billion, including $800 million for medical costs related to the same recalls. All-metal hip implants were developed to be more durable than traditional implants but have failed at a high rate. In some cases, they have shed metal fragments that have disabled patients. Traditional implants combine a ceramic or metal ball with a plastic socket. As many as 500,000 Americans are estimated to have received metal-on-metal hip replacements in the last five years, with J&J; the largest manufacturer of such products. The company withdrew its ASR metal-on-metal hip system in 2010 and faces more than 2,000 lawsuits from patients claiming to have been harmed by it. J&J; said global revenue rose 8 percent to $17.56 billion in the fourth quarter, below Wall Street expectations of $17.7 billion. “The sales miss was driven by lower-than-expected medical device and consumer sales,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro said in a research note. Sales of prescription drugs jumped 7 percent to $6.52 billion, helped by strong sales of its treatments for arthritis, psoriasis and HIV. “By any measure, we have transformed our pharmaceuticals business,” Chief Executive Alex Gorsky told analysts on a conference call. The business is bouncing back after several years of anemic sales due to generic competition for some of its top medicines. But J&J; said it expects its blockbuster Concerta treatment for attention deficit disorder to face pressure from cheaper generics early this year. Fourth-quarter sales of medical devices rose almost 14 percent to $7.38 billion, boosted by the company’s recent acquisition of trauma-device maker Synthes. Sales of J&J;’s array of consumer products fell almost 3 percent to $14.4 billion, hurt by the stronger dollar and recalls of Tylenol and other over-the-counter medicines that have curtailed availability of the brands.

394,JNJ,Arguments in first J&J; hip implant trial begin in Los Angeles,"Los Angeles (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson was aware of defects when it started selling its now-recalled metal hip implants in 2004, lawyers said on Friday during opening arguments in a personal injury trial against the company. More than 10,000 lawsuits have been filed against J&J; after its DePuy unit recalled the all-metal ASR hip implants in 2010 following recognition that they were failing at higher-than-expected rates. Opening arguments were heard in the first case to reach trial. The suit was filed in California Superior Court by 66-year-old Loren Kransky, whose ASR hip was replaced early last year. “I’m sure that ultimately there will be some sort of global settlement,” said Georgene Vairo, professor of law at Loyola University in Los Angeles. “But they are going to litigate some cases. Even though it was clear that something was wrong with the product, that may not be the cause in each individual claim.” Kransky’s attorney, Michael Kelly, said the ASR hip caused elevated levels of cobalt and chromium in Kransky, while J&J; lawyers said the amount of metals shown in tests was not high enough to cause health problems. “Doctors relied 100 percent on DePuy and patients relied 100 percent on doctors and information was kept from them,” said Kelly. Lawyers for J&J; contend that Kransky, a lifelong smoker suffering from diabetes and eventually kidney cancer, was in extremely poor health, mainly caused by vascular disease, well before he received the ASR hip. “The evidence will show that DePuy is a good and conscientious company,” said J&J; attorney Alexander Calfo. He said the doctor who removed the ASR implant from Kransky will testify that he was “coached” by the Kransky family and its lawyers to use certain phrases, including the implication of metal poisoning, in medical records of the procedure.

399,JNJ,"EU regulator charges J&J;, Novartis over Dutch painkiller delay","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU regulators stepped up their fight against drug companies suspected of blocking cheap generic medicines, charging Johnson & Johnson and Novartis over a painkiller called fentanyl. The antitrust watchdog said it believed the two had agreed a “pay-for-delay” deal on generic versions of the drug, sold under brand names including Duragesic, hurting Dutch consumers and healthcare providers. Novartis and its Sandoz unit, in this case the suppliers of the generic version, said they would examine the regulator’s “statement of objections” and would take advantage of their rights of defense against the charges. Johnson & Johnson’s Dutch unit Janssen-Cilag said it would cooperate with the Commission and defended the deal. “The arrangement we had with Sandoz was legitimate. We believe we did not infringe any rules,” Janssen spokesman Stefan Gijssels said. It is the latest such case launched by the European Commission after it filed charges against Merck KGaA, Lundbeck, Servier and several other pharmaceutical companies last year. Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have warned pharmaceutical companies against agreements where brand-name companies pay generic competitors to withhold their rival drugs from the market, saying such deals result in additional costs for consumers. The Commission, which acts as antitrust regulator in the 27-nation European Union, said it had sent its charge sheet to U.S.-based Johnson & Johnson and Swiss group Novartis over an agreement between their Dutch subsidiaries. “If our preliminary conclusions are confirmed, the Dutch subsidiaries ... entered into a so-called ‘co-promotion’ agreement to avoid competing against each other, depriving users of fentanyl in the Netherlands from access to a cheaper painkiller,” the Commission said in a statement. It said the agreement between Janssen-Cilag and Sandoz meant Dutch consumers were not able to get access to cheaper generic fentanyl from July 2005 to December 2006. The charges arose from an investigation of the pharmaceuticals sector after a Commission report highlighted deals between major drugmakers aimed at hindering or blocking generic medicines in pay-for-delay deals.

402,JNJ,Houston law firm wins big fees from Johnson & Johnson,"Feb 1 (Reuters) - An Arkansas state judge on Friday ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $181 million to the Houston law firm Bailey Perrin Bailey for its work on a Medicare fraud case brought on behalf of the state of Arkansas. Ten months earlier, a state judge awarded Arkansas $1.2 billion in a 2007 lawsuit in which the state, represented by Bailey Perrin, had claimed Johnson & Johnson downplayed the risks of the antipsychotic drug Risperdal. The $181 million, ordered by Judge Tim Fox, represents a 15 percent contingency fee the Arkansas Attorney General’s Office agreed to pay Bailey Perrin, according to court documents. According to the state, Bailey Perrin assigned up to 10 lawyers and five paralegals to the case. Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman Teresa Mueller called the fee “excessive.” Mueller said the company, which has already appealed the award to Arkansas, will also appeal the legal fees. “The fee awarded represents about $19,700 per hour for each of the outside attorneys and staff who worked on the case for the state, based on our reconstruction of their actual time,” Mueller said in a statement. During a two-week trial, Arkansas alleged that Johnson & Johnson deceived thousands of doctors by marketing Risperdal for unapproved uses in children and the elderly. As a result, the state said, Arkansas’ Medicaid insurance program greatly overpaid for the drug. Ken Bailey, a name partner at the firm, declined comment, and two other firm leaders did not respond to requests for comment. The 23-lawyer Bailey Perrin Bailey, which specializes in products liability, personal injury and defective drug claims, is also representing a New Mexico, Kentucky and Mississippi in lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson for Medicaid fraud. Aaron Sadler, a spokesman for the Office of Attorney General Dustin McDaniel, said the ruling “has nothing whatsoever to do with reconstruction of time,” but everything to do with the defendants’ deceptive and illegal actions.",2012013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-baileyperrinfee/houston-law-firm-wins-big-fees-from-johnson-johnson-idUSL1N0B1JMH20130201
403,JNJ,J&J; metal hip failed because of toxic debris - expert at trial,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Toxicity caused by debris from a metal-on-metal hip implant meant that the device had to be removed from a 66-year-old man who is suing manufacturer Johnson & Johnson, according to expert testimony heard at the trial on Friday. “I concluded that his hip failed because of the toxic exposure,” said Robert Harrison, an occupational medicine specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in treating plaintiff Loren Kransky but did review the medical records. The testimony was heard in Los Angeles Superior Court in the first lawsuit to go to trial involving all-metal hips made by J&J;’s DePuy unit. More than 10,000 U.S. lawsuits have been filed since the hips were recalled from the market in 2010. As many as 500,000 Americans are estimated to have received metal-on-metal hip replacements. Lawyers for Kransky argue that J&J; was aware of the defects in the ASR hip implants, including the risk of poisoning from cobalt and chromium metal debris, even before it started selling the devices in 2004. Kransky’s blood tests showed that his levels of cobalt and chromium reached as much as seven times normal after he received the ASR hip. The Food and Drug Administration last month proposed that companies making all-metal hip replacements provide additional information proving they are safe and effective before being allowed to continue selling them. The agency said it was not recommending a specific level of metals in the blood as a trigger for revision surgery because there was not enough evidence to demonstrate a correlation between those levels and patient outcomes. J&J; attorney Alex Calfo said the amount of cobalt measured in Kransky was not enough to cause any adverse systemic health effects. Trial testimony earlier in the week included DePuy executives explaining that the ASR hip was tested in the laboratory at a single angle of implantation. Plaintiffs’ lawyers contend that they should have tested it using multiple angles. All-metal hip implants were developed to be more durable than traditional implants with ceramic or plastic components, but have been shown to fail at a higher rate than traditional implants. A J&J; study presented at the trial showed that the company had estimated that 37 percent of the devices would fail within about five years of implant surgery.

405,JNJ,J.C. Penney CEO sees return to growth this year: CNBC,"(Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) Chief Executive Ron Johnson still thinks the department store operator will return to growth in 2013 despite severe sales declines in fiscal 2012, he told CNBC in an interview on Wednesday. Penney, which operates 1,100 department stores, began a turnaround a year ago that called for the elimination of most coupons and sales events, along with a four-year transformation of its 700 largest stores into a collection of 100 shops in each store for brands like Levi’s and PVH Corp’s (PVH.N) Izod. “I believe we will return to growth this year,” Johnson said. Sales collapsed 23.1 percent in the first nine months of the fiscal year as long-term customers, trained for years to seek out discounts, balked at the pricing strategy. But Johnson said that the arrival of new shops for brands like Joe Fresh (L.TO), coming in mid-March, and a new home goods section anchored by Martha Stewart products in May will bring in the new customers Penney needs to grow. “The new JCP is coming out of the ground and we think that’s going to allow us to return to growth,” Johnson told CNBC in an interview from a Penney store in Dallas. “It’s even more important to attract new customers, and that’s the key to this.” Penney is still on pace to open another 30 of the boutiques in 2013, he added. Initial results of the first batch of boutiques, opened last summer, were promising, with sales per square foot well above the store average. The company has lost more than half its market value in the last year, and many on Wall Street expect disastrous results when Penney reports its holiday quarter results at the end of the month. UBS forecasts same-store sales to be down 28 percent. Faced with an exodus of the traditional Penney shopper, who Johnson said was older and poorer than those at its rivals, the company has backtracked partially on its no-sales, no-coupons approach and will now hold sales for special events like Valentine’s Day. But given the depth of the sales hemorrhage and the downgrade of its debt to junk status last year, there have been doubts about whether Penney will have enough money to fund its transformation, set for completion in 2015. Johnson, who said he has the backing of the Penney board, reiterated his intention to use cash from operations to fund the project, though he did not exclude borrowing money if need be. “We’ve yet to tap into the (debt) revolver. It doesn’t mean we wouldn’t at some point.” When asked about a New York Post report that Penney was planning to cut 10 percent of staff at its Plano, Texas headquarters, Johnson said only that the company needs the “right cost structure.” “The number one priority is to return to growth.

408,JNJ,"After failed trials, J&J; pivots to early-stage Alzheimer's","CHICAGO (Reuters) - A little over a year ago, Dr. Husseini Manji, global head of neuroscience drug development at Johnson & Johnson, predicted that brain researchers were on the cusp of a golden age. That was before J&J;’s highly anticipated Alzheimer’s drug, bapineuzumab, failed to improve memory and thinking skills in closely watched clinical trials of people with mild to moderate forms of the disease. Had it worked, the drug would have been the first to alter the course of Alzheimer’s, a fatal brain-wasting disease that affects 36 million people worldwide. It also would have meant billions of dollars in annual sales. Instead, J&J; and its partners, Pfizer and Elan, pulled the plug on the intravenous treatment after years of development. Nevertheless, Manji, the Kenyan-born scientist who spent 15 years researching neuropsychiatric diseases for the National Institutes of Health, stands by his prediction. The former chief of the NIH’s Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program, who recently met with computer experts at NASA to understand how best to untangle the web of disparate information on brain science, says there is nothing more complex than brain disorders. “We shouldn’t expect it to be easy,” Manji, 53, who leads the company’s research efforts in Alzheimer’s, mood disorders, schizophrenia and pain conditions, said in an interview. Like its rivals, J&J; is preparing to pivot from testing drugs in people who already have dementia to early-stage patients, when drugs may have a better shot at working. In November, J&J; partnered with Japan’s Shionogi to gain access to Shionogi’s oral beta secretase, or BACE, inhibitor, a promising new class of drugs that aims to prevent the production of the Alzheimer’s-linked protein beta amyloid before it can form toxic clumps in people’s brains. While J&J; and its partners are retooling bapineuzumab into a more convenient shot formulation - instead of an IV - the company is also working on other approaches, including an amyloid-attacking antibody similar to bapineuzumab, called AAB003, and a vaccine that would enlist the help of an individual’s immune system to fight the disease. Manji says the company remains committed to amyloid-clearing treatments. He expects doctors will need a whole menu of drugs to address the massive burden of Alzheimer’s, which is expected to affect 115 million people globally by 2050. Experts liken Alzheimer’s to heart disease, in which fatty plaques build up in the arteries for years before breaking loose, causing a stroke or heart attack. “If someone comes into the ER with a heart attack and you give them a (cholesterol-lowering) statin drug for the first time, you are probably 15 years too late,” said Dr. Michael Rafii, an Alzheimer’s expert at the University of California at San Diego. Likewise, with Alzheimer’s, when a patient enters the dementia phase, treatments that remove amyloid may be too little, too late. That may be what occurred with bapineuzumab, which showed signs that it was removing plaques but offered no cognitive benefit. Late-stage studies of Eli Lilly and Co’s similar drug, solanezumab, also failed to help patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s, but when the results of two studies were combined, researchers saw a hint of benefit in people with mild disease. Many experts believe BACE inhibitors would be ideal for very early-stage patients because they may prevent dementia from developing. Lilly and Merck already have midstage trials under way for their BACE inhibitors, with safety results expected by early 2014. J&J; is still working out the details, but Manji said he expects human trials of the Shionogi drug to start soon. Unlike anti-amyloid drugs, such as bapineuzumab, that remove plaque after it has formed, BACE inhibitors focus on preventing the production of beta amyloid. The drugs are designed to keep the enzyme beta-secretase from chopping up a larger protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP) into bits that make up beta amyloid. A study published in July in the journal Nature helped fuel enthusiasm for BACE inhibitors. It found that people who have a mutation in APP are protected from Alzheimer’s, and this gene affects the activity of BACE, suggesting that BACE inhibitors might work. “It is almost like these people are born with natural BACE inhibition that seems to protect them,” Manji said. Developing a beta secretase inhibitor has presented a number of challenges, including understanding how to get the drugs across the protective blood-brain barrier and into the right spot in the brain. But after a decade of research, Manji says there is optimism that “the BACE nut has been cracked.” Manji said the challenge now is to block some of the enzyme’s activity, without causing unintended side effects. “What we still don’t completely know is if you get into enough people, are there some off-target effects you will discover?” To test new drugs in people with earlier-stage Alzheimer’s, scientists have organized a series of prevention trials, enrolling people who are genetically predisposed to develop Alzheimer’s or whose tests suggest they have pre-symptomatic disease. Two Roche drugs, crenezumab and gantenerumab, and Lilly’s solanezumab and its BACE drug are among the first to be tested in these trials. No J&J; drugs will be part in these early trials, but Manji says the company will benefit. “I think the whole field is going to learn so much about the disease and the trajectory and the progression, irrespective of what compound is being used,” he said. Meanwhile, J&J; has provided seed funding for a pilot study in people with Down syndrome, another population that is predisposed to develop dementia early. Manji is excited about efforts with partner Pfizer to develop a vaccine that targets amyloid. He says the vaccine, now in midstage trials, has overcome some of the issues that scuttled development of a similar effort by Elan in 2002. Manji thinks the quickest way for drug companies to find answers to problems like Alzheimer’s will be through alliances to share information about underlying disease biology. “If we are willing to stay the course and work together, we will make progress,” he said.

410,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson recalls more metal hip implants,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson, the subject of thousands of lawsuits stemming from the 2010 recall of its ASR all-metal hip implants, last month recalled a second type of metal hip component that it sold outside of the United States. J&J;’s DePuy unit told doctors in January that the Adept modular heads, a component used with its Adept metal-on-metal hip replacement device, should not be used after data showed that the devices were failing at a higher than expected rate, according to an emailed statement. The email said British data showed that the Adept implants needed to be replaced in about 12 percent of patients after seven years. An Australian patient registry showed a revision rate of seven percent after three years. The company said it sold around 7,500 of the hip components between 2004 to September 2011. They were sold in 21 countries, but not in the United States. In August 2010, J&J; recalled two types of its ASR metal-on-metal hip implants after they were also linked to high failure rates. Some 93,000 of the ASR hips were sold prior to the recall, which has generated more than 10,000 lawsuits. The first suit, brought by a retired Montana prison guard who says the hip caused metal poisoning, is currently being heard in a Los Angeles Superior Court. J&J; has set aside more than $3 billion to cover costs for the ASR hip recall. The company over the past couple of years has also had to recall over-the-counter drugs, contact lenses, heart devices, such as stents, and insulin pump cartridges.

The designation is being awarded to experimental drugs the agency views as potentially substantial improvements over existing therapies in a coordinated effort to get the medicines to patients faster. Twelve more drugs are currently under consideration for breakthrough status, the FDA said. Under the collaboration, Abbott will develop a companion diagnostic test to identify high-risk CLL patients who have an abnormality within a specific chromosome that makes them most likely to respond to treatment with ibrutinib. The Abbott technology known as FISH - fluorescence in-situ hybridization - can identify whether too many, or too few, copies of a particular gene are present in the body’s cells or whether certain genes have rearrangements that play an active role in disease progression. With advances in genetic screening and better understanding of the molecular biology of cancer, many more drugs are expected to be developed along with companion diagnostics. Abbott previously worked with Pfizer Inc to develop a companion diagnostic for Pfizer’s Xalkori to identify the estimated 4 percent of lung cancer patients with a specific gene mutation called ALK that the drug targets.

417,JNJ,Jury awards $3.35 million in vaginal mesh case against Johnson & Johnson,"ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (Reuters) - A jury on Monday said Johnson & Johnson should pay a South Dakota woman $3.35 million for failing to adequately warn her doctor of the potential dangers of a vaginal mesh implant made by the company’s Ethicon subsidiary, and for misrepresenting the product in brochures. It was the first verdict among some 1,800 vaginal mesh cases pending in New Jersey against Ethicon and J&J; and could have an impact on thousands of lawsuits against other manufacturers of similar products. The lawsuit, in state Superior Court in Atlantic City, New Jersey, was brought by Linda Gross, 47, of Watertown, South Dakota, in November 2008. It alleged that the Gyncare Prolift vaginal mesh was not safe and that J&J; and Ethicon were liable, among other things, for “their defective design, manufacture, warnings and instructions.” The Ethicon product, before being taken off the U.S. market last year, was used to treat pelvic organ collapse, a condition for which the plaintiff, a nurse, was treated in November 2008. That condition occurs when tissue that holds the pelvic organs in place is weak or stretched and bulges into the vagina. There are different types of this prolapse condition, which usually occurs after menopause, childbirth or a hysterectomy. The vaginal mesh was also used by many doctors to treat a severe form of urinary incontinence, called stress incontinence. Gross, a nurse, filed her lawsuit after having surgery in 2006 to install a Gyncare Prolift for pelvic prolapse. She alleged the surgery led to a variety of problems, including mesh erosion, scar tissue, inflammation and “neurologic compromise to ... structures and tissue.” She said she had to seek medical treatment and had 18 operations to repair the damage caused by the mesh. Ben Anderson, a member of the trail team for the plaintiff, called the jury verdict “a strong statement to Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon that they cannot put profits before women’s safety.” The verdict, by a panel of six women and three men, followed a six-week trial before Judge Carol Higbee. After the verdict was delivered, the judge ruled that she will allow arguments on punitive damages. Those hearings are scheduled for Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. Sheri Woodruff, a spokeswoman for Ethicon, said, “While we are always concerned when a patient experiences medical conditions like those suffered by the plaintiff, all surgeries for pelvic organ prolapse present risks of complications.” She said she could not comment further. In addition to the lawsuits against Ethicon and J&J; in New Jersey, about 11,000 other claims have been filed against a variety of manufacturers of vaginal mesh, according to Florida attorney Bryan Aylstock. Those claims have been consolidated into five cases that are pending in federal court in West Virginia, according to Aylstock, co-lead counsel in one of the West Virginia cases. The defendants in those cases are Ethicon, C.R. Bard Inc, Boston Scientific Corp, Coloplast, and Endo Health Solutions’ American Medical Systems Inc. Last year, jurors in a state court in Bakersfield, California, said C.R. Bard was liable for $3.6 million in the first case over the vaginal mesh devices to go to trial. The panel found the plaintiff and her husband were entitled to a total of $5.5 million for her medical expenses, pain, suffering and other damages resulting from Bard’s Avaulta Plus device. Last June, J&J; announced that it had stopped selling the vaginal mesh following lawsuits that allege it caused infections and bleeding. On Monday, the company said there were 4,000 lawsuits against J&J; involving the vaginal mesh product pending in the United States. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said plaintiff attorneys generally pick a particularly strong case to argue first and that the judgment against J&J; was sizable. But, he added that subsequent plaintiffs’ cases coming to trial might be less forceful, and that J&J;, with annual revenue approaching $70 billion, could easily withstand eventual financial hits from the litigation. “The size of the caseload presents a significant legal risk to J&J;, although it’s hard to quantify,” Conover said.

418,JNJ,UPDATE 3-Jury awards $3.35 mln in vaginal mesh case against J&J;,"By Dave Warner ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., Feb 25 (Reuters) - A jury on Monday said Johnson & Johnson should pay a South Dakota woman $3.35 million for failing to adequately warn her doctor of the potential dangers of a vaginal mesh implant made by the company’s Ethicon subsidiary, and for misrepresenting the product in brochures. It was the first verdict among some 1,800 vaginal mesh cases pending in New Jersey against Ethicon and J&J; and could have an impact on thousands of lawsuits against other manufacturers of similar products. The lawsuit, in state Superior Court in Atlantic City, New Jersey, was brought by Linda Gross, 47, of Watertown, South Dakota, in November 2008. It alleged that the Gyncare Prolift vaginal mesh was not safe and that J&J; and Ethicon were liable, among other things, for “their defective design, manufacture, warnings and instructions.” The Ethicon product, before being taken off the U.S. market last year, was used to treat pelvic organ collapse, a condition for which the plaintiff, a nurse, was treated in November 2008. That condition occurs when tissue that holds the pelvic organs in place is weak or stretched and bulges into the vagina. There are different types of this prolapse condition, which usually occurs after menopause, childbirth or a hysterectomy. The vaginal mesh was also used by many doctors to treat a severe form of urinary incontinence, called stress incontinence. Gross, a nurse, filed her lawsuit after having surgery in 2006 to install a Gyncare Prolift for pelvic prolapse. She alleged the surgery led to a variety of problems, including mesh erosion, scar tissue, inflammation and “neurologic compromise to ... structures and tissue.” She said she had to seek medical treatment and had 18 operations to repair the damage caused by the mesh. Ben Anderson, a member of the trail team for the plaintiff, called the jury verdict “a strong statement to Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon that they cannot put profits before women’s safety.” The verdict, by a panel of six women and three men, followed a six-week trial before Judge Carol Higbee. After the verdict was delivered, the judge ruled that she will allow arguments on punitive damages. Those hearings are scheduled for Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. Sheri Woodruff, a spokeswoman for Ethicon, said, “While we are always concerned when a patient experiences medical conditions like those suffered by the plaintiff, all surgeries for pelvic organ prolapse present risks of complications.” She said she could not comment further. In addition to the lawsuits against Ethicon and J&J; in New Jersey, about 11,000 other claims have been filed against a variety of manufacturers of vaginal mesh, according to Florida attorney Bryan Aylstock. Those claims have been consolidated into five cases that are pending in federal court in West Virginia, according to Aylstock, co-lead counsel in one of the West Virginia cases. The defendants in those cases are Ethicon, C.R. Bard Inc , Boston Scientific Corp, Coloplast, and Endo Health Solutions’ American Medical Systems Inc. Last year, jurors in a state court in Bakersfield, California, said C.R. Bard was liable for $3.6 million in the first case over the vaginal mesh devices to go to trial. The panel found the plaintiff and her husband were entitled to a total of $5.5 million for her medical expenses, pain, suffering and other damages resulting from Bard’s Avaulta Plus device. Last June, J&J; announced that it had stopped selling the vaginal mesh following lawsuits that allege it caused infections and bleeding. On Monday, the company said there were 4,000 lawsuits against J&J; involving the vaginal mesh product pending in the United States. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said plaintiff attorneys generally pick a particularly strong case to argue first and that the judgment against J&J; was sizable. But, he added that subsequent plaintiffs’ cases coming to trial might be less forceful, and that J&J;, with annual revenue approaching $70 billion, could easily withstand eventual financial hits from the litigation. “The size of the caseload presents a significant legal risk to J&J;, although it’s hard to quantify,” Conover said. Conover said  J&J; has taken recent charges of more than $4 billion  for recalls of defective artificial hips, without badly denting the company’s share price. He said charges are likely to be considerably less for the vaginal mesh litigation, “So I don’t think this is a big overhang” for the company.

The company plans to spend the next few weeks calling Elan shareholders about its offer made on Feb. 18, according to a source familiar with the situation. Royalty Pharma, which buys royalty streams of patented drugs and whose portfolio includes rheumatoid arthritis treatments Humira and Remicade, is turning to Elan’s investors because it has received no formal response from the company about its offer, said the source, who wished to remain anonymous because of not being allowed to speak to the media. Elan’s biggest shareholder is Johnson & Johnson with an 18 percent stake. An Elan spokesman declined to comment, as did Johnson & Johnson. A Royalty Pharma spokesman did not return a request for comment. Royalty Pharma’s offer, worth $11 per Elan share, came just days after Elan announced it had sold its 50 percent interest in multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri for $3.25 billion plus future royalty payments to U.S. partner Biogen Idec. As a result of the Tysabri sale, Elan announced on Friday that it would return $1 billion to shareholders and make acquisitions with the rest of the $3.25 billion raised from the deal. Elan did not disclose the Royalty Pharma offer, which was not a formal bid. Elan, in a statement on Monday, said Royalty Pharma’s bid was an “indicative, conditional, proposal which may or may not lead to an offer being made for the entire issued share capital of the Company”. Elan also called the Royalty Pharma bid “highly opportunistic”, given that shareholders had not had the opportunity to assess the full benefits of the Tysabri sale. However, Royalty Pharma does not think Elan’s management had the experience to make acquisitions, the firm said in its statement announcing its proposed offer on Monday. Still, Royalty Pharma may have a tough time buying Elan given its $11-a-share offer, wrote Corey Davis, an equity analyst for Jefferies, in a note on Tuesday. Royalty Pharma will have to get closer to $20 a share if it wants to buy the company, wrote Davis, who has a “buy” on Elan. Elan’s stock on Tuesday closed slightly above the offer price at $11.03, a 7 percent increase from Friday’s close on the New York Stock Exchange.

425,JNJ,Jury awards woman $7.76 million in damages for J&J; mesh,"(Reuters) - A New Jersey jury Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson and a subsidiary to pay $7.76 million in punitive damages to a South Dakota nurse who claimed she was harmed by the company’s vaginal mesh. Together with earlier compensatory damages, the decision means J&J; and its Ethicon subsidiary would be responsible for paying Linda Gross, 47, of Watertown, South Dakota, some $11.1 million. J&J; said in a statement that it plans to appeal the decision and that the punitive damages were unsupported by the evidence. The product, before being taken off the U.S. market last year, was used to treat pelvic organ collapse, a condition for which Gross was treated in July 2006. The Atlantic City case is the first of about 1,800 lawsuits against J&J; in New Jersey, the company’s home state. In addition, there are 11,000 other claims pending against several other manufacturers in a federal case in West Virginia, according to Florida attorney Bryan Aylstock. “Linda Gross cannot turn back the clock and make her misery and pain disappear,” her attorney Adam Slater said after the verdict, adding that the jury decided that J&J; and its Ethicon unit “should be severely punished financially.” The lawsuit, in Atlantic City Superior Court, was brought by Gross in November 2008. It alleged that the Gyncare Prolift vaginal mesh was not safe and that J&J; and Ethicon were liable for, among other things, defective design, manufacture, warnings and instructions. According to Ben Anderson, a plaintiff attorney in the case, the jury did not find a design defect, but did determine that there had been a failure to warn Gross’s doctor of the hazards, and that there was a fraudulent misrepresentation of the procedure in patient brochures. Anderson said Gross has had 18 surgeries in which doctors attempted to remove the mesh, and more than 440 doctor office visits. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said Thursday that the litigation does not pose a huge financial risk for J&J.; “From an investment standpoint, I don’t think it’s going to be too damaging,” he said, adding that plaintiff attorneys usually pick the best cases to go first, and they are usually not representative of the entire group of patients who sue.

430,JNJ,"Trial plaintiff says J&J; hips defective, company says not liable","(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy unit was well aware of defects in its all-metal hips when plaintiff Loren Kransky was implanted with one of the devices in 2007, lawyers for the 65-year-old man said in closing trial arguments. The lawsuit filed by the retired Montana prison guard is the first to reach court out of more than 10,000 filed against J&J; in the wake of its 2010 recall of the ASR artificial hips. Kransky attorney Brian Panish told Los Angeles Superior Court jurors that J&J; should be ordered to pay around $5 million for Kransky’s pain and suffering, and as much as $179 million in punitive damages. The proceedings were monitored over the Courtroom View Network. J&J; recalled 93,000 of its ASR metal hips after determining that they were failing at a higher-than-expected rate. Kransky’s attorneys argued that the design of the hip was defective, leading to the shedding of metal debris that caused tissue poisoning and pain as well as the need for the plaintiff to undergo hip revision surgery. “Any compensation should not be reduced simply because the plaintiff was more susceptible to injury than a normally healthy person,” Panish said. Both sides in the case agreed that Kransky’s medical problems, including diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, heart disease and vascular disease, were not related to the ASR hip implant. J&J; attorney Michael Zellers argued that Kransky’s ASR hip was implanted at an incline that was steeper than company guidelines advised. He also said the plaintiff’s need for revision surgery was caused by an infection. Testimony in the trial included DePuy executives explaining that the ASR hip was tested in the laboratory at a single angle of implantation. Plaintiffs’ lawyers contend that they should have tested it using multiple angles. “We know there is no perfect hip design. There are always trade-offs,” Zellers said, adding that the company designed the all-metal device with the aim of developing a longer-lasting hip that would show less wear than existing devices. The J&J; attorney argued that there is no medical consensus on what levels of chromium and cobalt, the metals shed by ASR hips, could cause harm to patients. “Ultimately the product did not perform as DePuy wanted it to perform or expected it to perform,” he said. All-metal hip implants were developed to be more durable than traditional implants with ceramic or plastic components, but have been shown to fail at a higher rate than traditional implants.

The drug, which J&J; has developed in partnership with German drugmaker Bayer AG, was earlier denied approval in June for the same use, as a panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raised concerns about missing trial data and bleeding risks. In response to this, J&J; submitted to the FDA additional data that showed the benefits and risks of Xarelto in patients who had withdrawn from the study. “While we saw an increase in major bleeding, there was no increase in fatal bleeding,” said Dr. Christopher Nessel, Vice President at Janssen, a unit of J&J.; Xarelto is already approved for six other uses, including reducing the risk of blood clots in patients who have had hip and knee replacement surgery, and to prevent strokes among people with a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. J&J; said on Monday it was evaluating the rejection letter issued by the FDA.",3052013,http://www.reuters.com/article/jnj-fda-bloodthinner/u-s-fda-denies-approval-to-expanded-use-of-jj-bayers-xarelto-idUSL4N0BX04420130305
434,JNJ,Jury orders J&J; unit to pay $8.3 million in metal hip trial,"(Reuters) - A Los Angeles jury ordered Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy orthopedic unit to pay more than $8 million in damages in the first trial of nearly 11,000 lawsuits filed over the company’s recalled artificial metal hips. In a mixed verdict, the Los Angeles Superior Court jury on Friday found that the hips were defective, but that DePuy did not act with fraud or malice. DePuy was ordered to pay more than $338,000 in medical costs and $8 million for pain and suffering to plaintiff Loren Kransky. No punitive damages were awarded. Lawyers for other plaintiffs said the verdict, in a suit filed by a retired Montana prison guard suffering from kidney cancer and other ailments, bodes well for other cases, while DePuy said it would appeal. Jeff Jonas, an analyst for Gabelli & Co, said that while the litigation will be expensive, the eventual payouts are unlikely to be very onerous for J&J;, one of the world’s largest healthcare companies with annual revenue of about $70 billion. He predicted that the J&J; unit will eventually offer a national settlement, under which thousands of hip plaintiffs would likely take what is offered rather than face years of litigation and appeals. DePuy recalled the hips in 2010, prompted by recognition that the devices were failing at higher-than-expected rates. Some 93,000 ASR hips were sold prior to the recall. “We believe ASR XL was properly designed, and that DePuy’s actions concerning the product were appropriate and responsible,” DePuy spokeswoman Loire Gawreluk said in a statement. She said the planned appeal will be based on grounds including the fact that the court did not allow the company to tell the jury that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had reviewed the device and cleared it for sale. Kransky attorney Brian Panish said the jury decision “is the first day of reckoning for DePuy and Johnson & Johnson ... We expect to get punitive damages in the next trial.” He had argued that the ASR hip resulted in elevated levels of cobalt and chromium in Kransky, causing him pain that required the hip to be replaced. J&J; lawyers maintained that there is no medical consensus on what levels of the metals may cause harm to patients and said Kransky’s other medical problems, including diabetes, heart disease, and kidney cancer, were the source of his pain and suffering. The verdict “is everything we could hope for, given the limitations of this case,” James O’Callahan, a plaintiff’s lawyer handling other DePuy hip implant cases, said in an emailed statement. Kransky’s case was expedited under a California law that gives preferential status to plaintiffs who are terminally ill. Another hip implant trial in Illinois state court starts on Monday. Two cases in federal multi district litigation are set for trial in May and July in Ohio. “A more representative case should have a stronger recovery (for the plaintiff) because the injury related to the hip is more of a long-term problem they’re going to be facing,” said Ellen Relkin of Weitz & Luxenberg, co-lead plaintiff’s counsel for the federal multi district litigation consolidated in Ohio. The metal implants were developed to be more durable than traditional implants, which combine a ceramic or metal ball with a plastic socket, but concerns have grown after they were shown to fail more often. With wear, all-metal implants can shed metal debris where two components connect, potentially damaging bone and soft tissue. The FDA last month issued a proposal calling on companies that make all-metal hip replacements to provide additional information proving they are safe and effective before being allowed to continue selling them. J&J; has set aside more than $3 billion to cover costs for the ASR hip recall. Over the past three years, the company has also recalled hundreds of millions of packages of Tylenol, Motrin and other over the counter drugs and consumer products due to quality control problems that are now being resolved. And thousands of U.S. women have sued the company for alleged harm from J&J; vaginal mesh products that were used to treat stress incontinence and other problems. Gabelli’s Jonas said J&J;’s reputation, despite those problems and related costly litigation, remains mostly intact. “They’ve had a number of missteps, but they have enormous brand equity that they’ve built up for 100 years,” he said. Kransky’s attorneys had asked for punitive damages of between $72 million and $179 million, in addition to $5 million for pain in suffering and $338,000 in medical costs. As many as 500,000 American are estimated to have received metal-on-metal hip replacements.

437,JNJ,Analysis: J&J;'s answer to Botox may escalate war on wrinkles,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson may soon cause frown lines at Allergan Inc, maker of Botox. J&J; expects to seek U.S. approval next year for an anti-wrinkle drug that could break Botox’s near monopoly, an 85 percent market share. The J&J; product could be available in the United States in 2015 and overseas a few years later, the company said. Two smaller drugmakers with similar products haven’t made substantial inroads into the almost $900 million a year market. But dermatologists and analysts say J&J; could be a real threat to Botox, an iconic brand since it was introduced more than a decade ago. Allergan declined to comment on the potential rival. “J&J; is probably the only company that can go head to head directly with Allergan,” said Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse. “They have a big marketing budget and sales force, and an attractive cosmetic portfolio” of other products to offer dermatologists. Still, J&J;’s quest won’t be easy. Analysts and dermatologists said its product likely would need to work faster, last longer or be significantly cheaper than Botox in order to wrest market share from the original injectable wrinkle fighter. “J&J; is a company I’d take seriously; they have great research and try to be industry leaders in every category,” said Dr. Kenneth Beer, a dermatologist in West Palm Beach, Florida who has been a consultant for Allergan and J&J.; But he said patients aren’t quick to switch from something with which they are familiar. “Allergan has built such a strong brand. People ask for Botox by name. This will be an uphill struggle” for Johnson & Johnson. J&J; has not yet unveiled the data from completed late-stage trials for the still unnamed drug. But David Wilson, president of J&J;’s Mentor division, told Reuters he was pleased with the results. “What we hope to offer is a product of certainly comparable quality to Botox...to basically be on par with them” in terms of effectiveness and safety, Wilson said. “We’ve worked to make sure our data are exactly what the FDA is expecting to see,” he added. Morningstar’s Waterhouse said the J&J; product likely would generate annual sales of $500 million within five years as a cosmetic product. Sales could hit $1 billion within a decade if it also is tested and approved for medical conditions such as migraine headaches, he said. Botox, approved in 2002 in the United States to temporarily smooth severe lines between the eyebrows, has become a $1.8 billion-a-year brand, used worldwide by celebrities, movie stars, the wealthy and increasingly, the middle class in both developed and emerging markets. Botox procedures in the United States can cost as much as $1,500 for full treatment on three areas of the face. The cosmetic treatment is not covered by health insurance. The drug, a form of botulinum toxin that works by temporarily paralyzing muscles, has also been approved for lucrative medical uses such as preventing underarm sweating, migraine headaches and overactive bladder. But about $850 million, or 48 percent of Botox sales, comes from original cosmetic uses - the market J&J; is going after, Wilson said. Despite Botox’s lock on the market, many patients are on the quest for a better Fountain of Youth and will give J&J;’s product a chance, said New York dermatologist Howard Sobel. “Some people are going to want bigger and better even if it’s not bigger and better,” Sobel said. “These are the patients that tell me, ‘Doctor, you used to make me look much better.’ They don’t realize ‘used to’ was 10 years ago and I can only bring them back to a certain point.” Other companies have tried and failed to knock Botox from its pedestal. Two similar anti-wrinkle fighters are approved in the United States: Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc’s Dysport, and Xeomin from privately held Merz Pharma Group, which was launched in January after a prolonged U.S. court battle with Allergan. Together, they have a 15 percent share of the cosmetic toxin market. Valeant and Merz did not comment on the potential J&J; threat. J&J;, one of the world’s biggest healthcare companies with annual sales of almost $70 billion, aims to leapfrog Dsyport and Xeomin and become a solid No. 2 in the market, Wilson said. Now-completed trials of the product will be the basis of a marketing application in the first half of 2014 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Wilson said. “We’ll make all the appropriate investments to support our program,” he said. “Professional education and training will be a significant pillar of our success.” Wilson noted, however, that the J&J; drug has not been tested head to head against Botox or other wrinkle fighters. Wilson’s unit, which J&J; acquired through its purchase of Mentor Corp in 2009, is the world’s top seller of breast implants and also markets dermal fillers and liposuction equipment. The addition of a wrinkle treatment would give Mentor greater sway with dermatologists and plastic surgeons, Wilson said. “The more we can offer doctors, the better. Our customers are using a lot of toxin and it will strengthen our position to provide it to them.” In the long term, Jeff Jonas, a healthcare analyst for Gabelli & Co, said J&J; can be expected to study and seek approvals of its product for the same lucrative medical uses as Botox. “Given the size of J&J; and their expertise in clinical trials, I think they’ll want to go after the whole market, not just half of it,” Jonas said. Sobel, who has many Botox patients, said J&J;’s product would be a hit if it were able to last five or six months, rather than the three or four months typical of Botox, Dysport and Xeomin. “That would be a breakthrough,” the dermatologist said, and allow patients to make fewer doctor visits for re-injections of the drug. “Or, if it’s not truly different in its activity, they can distinguish it by making it cheaper,” Sobel said, speculating it could capture 20 to 25 percent of the market within three years if the price is right. The fiercest competition between the products will likely occur in emerging markets such as China and South America, where Botox is not firmly entrenched, Morningstar’s Waterhouse said. “There’s a lot more opportunity for growth there because you can grow from new customers who want premium luxury-type products,” he said. “Botox kind of aligns with luxury cars.” ",3222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jj-botox/analysis-jjs-answer-to-botox-may-escalate-war-on-wrinkles-idUSBRE92L0CU20130322
438,JNJ,J&J; recalls nearly 2 million blood glucose meters worldwide,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is recalling and replacing nearly 2 million meters used to measure blood glucose levels in diabetics due to a failure to operate properly at extremely high glucose readings, the company’s LifeScan unit said on Monday. In the United States, about 90,000 OneTouch Verio IQ meters are affected out of some 1.2 million units of that model being recalled worldwide, the company said. At extremely high glucose readings of 1024 mg/dl and above, the units have failed to provide a warning of dangerously high blood sugar and will shut off, potentially delaying proper treatment, the company said. LifeScan said it has notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other health regulators of the voluntary recall, as well as registered users and healthcare professionals. In addition to the Verio IQ model, J&J; is also recalling about 670,000 of its OneTouch Verio Pro meters in Europe and 4,900 of its hospital-based OneTouch Verio Pro+ meters in the Middle East, Europe and the Asia/Pacific region.

440,JNJ,"FDA approves Johnson & Johnson diabetes drug, canagliflozin","(Reuters) - FDA has approved a new diabetes drug from Johnson & Johnson, making it the first in its class to be approved in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, Invokana, after data showed it was effective in lowering blood sugar in patients with Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease. The FDA has asked for five postmarketing studies for the drug including a cardiovascular outcomes trial, an enhanced pharmacovigilance program, a bone safety study and two pediatric studies, the agency said in a statement on its website. (r.reuters.com/juj96t) Invokana is expected to generate sales in 2016 of around $468 million, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. Known chemically as canagliflozin, Invokana is a member of a new class of diabetes treatments called sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors that lower blood sugar by blocking reabsorbtion of glucose and increasing its excretion in urine. Earlier this year, an advisory committee to the FDA discussed the benefits and risks of canagliflozin with a focus on any potential increased risk of heart attack or stroke. A clinical study of patients at especially high risk of cardiovascular disease showed that within the first 30 days, 13 patients taking canagliflozin suffered a major cardiovascular event compared with just one patient taking a placebo. After that, the imbalance was reversed. The drug also caused a slight increase in unhealthy LDL cholesterol. In January, 2012, the FDA rejected a similar drug, dapagliflozin, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and AstraZeneca Plc, citing concerns over a possible increased risk of cancer and liver injury. The drug was subsequently approved in Europe under the brand name Forxiga. In January 2013, Britain’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), which decides whether drugs should be paid for on the state health service, declined to recommend that Forxiga be reimbursed and asked the companies for more information. Diabetes affects the body’s ability to metabolize glucose, which is needed for energy. Glucose circulates throughout the bloodstream, is filtered by the kidneys, and returned to body by glucose-specific transporters. By blocking the amount of glucose reabsorbed into the bloodstream, more is excreted in urine. Left untreated, diabetes can cause nerve damage, kidney disease and blindness. It affects roughly 25.8 million people in the United States, according to the American Diabetes Association. Despite FDA’s rejection of dapagliflozin, and a broad association in the class with genital infections, several companies are still developing SGLT2 inhibitors, including Astellas Pharma Inc, which recently filed for Japanese approval of its ipragliflozin, and Boehringer Ingelheim and Eli Lilly & Company, which recently filed for U.S. approval of their drug, empagliflozin.

443,JNJ,Court reverses $482 million stent case against Cordis,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cordis Corp, a Johnson and Johnson (JNJ.N) subsidiary, did not infringe on a patent owned by a radiologist in making its Cypher stents, an appeals court said on Thursday, reversing a ruling by a lower court that ordered Cordis to pay $482 million. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed a ruling from a Texas jury, which found Cordis guilty of infringement and ordered the payment. The appeals court ruled that Cordis had not infringed. Johnson & Johnson’s shares closed slightly higher at $82.41. The radiologist, Bruce Saffran, filed a lawsuit in 2007, accusing Cordis of infringing a patent he obtained in 1997 to make its Cypher brand drug-eluting stents. A jury ruled for Saffran in 2011. Cordis asked the judge to toss the ruling out, but he declined and added $111 million in interest, bringing the total award to $593 million. Cordis appealed to the Federal Circuit, which hears patent appeals. The appeals court reversed the lower court on Thursday. “We are pleased the federal court of appeals reversed the jury’s decision and held that Cordis did not infringe (the) plaintiff’s patent,” said Cordis spokeswoman Sandy Pound in an email. Paul Taskier, lead counsel for Saffran, said they were disappointed in the ruling. “We are considering an appropriate course of further action,” he said in an emailed statement. Stents are tiny mesh tubes used to prop open arteries that have been cleared of blockages. Drug-eluting stents are coated with medicine designed to prevent reclogging of the treated blood vessel. J&J; was the first company to sell a drug-coated stent with its Cypher. The field became fiercely competitive as rival devices entered the market, such as Abbott Laboratories’ (ABT.N) Xience model, widely considered to be superior to Cypher. In 2011, J&J; decided to get out of the heart stent business and the diversified healthcare company announced it would stop selling Cypher. The case in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas was No. 07-CV-0451. The case at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is Bruce Saffran v.

445,JNJ,Court reverses $482 million stent case against Cordis,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cordis Corp, a Johnson and Johnson (JNJ.N) subsidiary, did not infringe on a patent owned by a radiologist in making its Cypher stents, an appeals court said on Thursday, reversing a ruling by a lower court that ordered Cordis to pay $482 million. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed a ruling from a Texas jury, which found Cordis guilty of infringement and ordered the payment. The appeals court ruled that Cordis had not infringed. Johnson & Johnson’s shares were up about 0.2 percent at $82.23 in midafternoon trading. The radiologist, Bruce Saffran, filed a lawsuit in 2007, accusing Cordis of infringing a patent he obtained in 1997 to make its Cypher brand drug-eluting stents. A jury ruled for Saffran in 2011. Cordis asked the judge to toss the ruling out, but he declined and added $111 million in interest, bringing the total award to $593 million. Cordis appealed to the Federal Circuit, which hears patent appeals. The appeals court reversed the lower court on Thursday. “We are pleased the federal court of appeals reversed the jury’s decision and held that Cordis did not infringe plaintiff’s patent,” said Cordis spokeswoman Sandy Pound in an email. A lawyer for the radiologist was not immediately available for comment. Stents are tiny mesh tubes used to prop open arteries that have been cleared of blockages.

448,JNJ,GM sees new Impala appealing more to buyers than renters,"DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (GM.N) expects the new version of the Chevrolet Impala to lure more retail buyers, allowing the automaker to ditch the large car’s image as king of the car rentals, a top company official said on Monday. “We see the mix shift going from about 70 percent fleet and 30 retail, really turning that around, becoming 70 percent retail,” Don Johnson, Chevrolet vice president of sales, told reporters at the company’s assembly plant in Detroit-Hamtramck, where the Impala is built. Fleet customers include car rental companies. Jim Hall, managing director of automotive consulting firm 2953 Analytics, said the key to GM achieving its goals is making sure consumers know about the new car, and that means spending the money to advertise it. “When was the last time you saw an Impala commercial?’ he said. “When you market a car, you keep the public interested in it. The longer you keep the intensity on marketing the car the more retail you’re going to get.” “This is a segment that demands marketing intensity as far as paying attention to it,” Hall added. “You’ve got to keep it in consumers’ minds.” Johnson said GM sees Impala’s U.S. sales rising from last year’s total of about 169,350, while also increasing the large-car segment’s overall reach and GM’s share of that. Sales growth will come largely from consumers moving up from the mid-sized car segment, followed by crossovers and near luxury. GM officials said the new 2014 Impala, which competes with the Ford (F.N) Taurus and Toyota (7203.T) Avalon, will attract younger, more male, more affluent, more educated buyers than the current model, helping drive down the average age for the nameplate, which currently is in the upper 50s. Johnson said the portion of new Impalas sold on lease is also expected to jump to the segment average of about 35 percent from its current rate of almost none. He doesn’t see Chevy’s push to make Impala more attractive to consumers cutting into Cadillac sales. The new Impala is larger and longer than the current version. GM’s first Impala TV commercial ran on opening day of the Major League Baseball season on March 31, but the full marketing campaign will hit in mid-May, officials said. Chevy will continue to sell the current version of the Impala, the Limited, as long as the demand is there, but it will be sold only to fleet customers, largely rental car companies, Johnson said. Impala is also assembled at GM’s Oshawa plant in Ontario, Canada. The new model is built on the global epsilon platform, which also is used for the Buick Regal and LaCrosse, Cadillac XTS and Chevy Malibu cars.

450,JNJ,"UPDATE 5-J.C. Penney ousts CEO, Mike Ullman returns to helm","* Johnson replaced discounts with low prices, sales plunged * Shares jump on Johnson’s ouster, then fall 6 pct on Ullman news * Analyst speculates move could presage a sale By Phil Wahba April 8 (Reuters) - Attention J.C. Penney shoppers: Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss. The struggling department store chain parted ways with Chief Executive Ron Johnson, who failed to win over shoppers and investors with his everyday-low-price strategy, and on Monday rehired Johnson’s predecessor, former CEO Myron Ullman, to revive the company. Johnson’s botched transformation led to a 25 percent decline in sales last year, with the bleeding worsening each quarter. Shares in J.C. Penney rose nearly 11 percent in afterhours trade after a CNBC report that Johnson was out, but then fell 6.2 percent to $14.88 after Penney disclosed Ullman’s return. “Certain investors had beaten the drum saying that a change was needed and Johnson wasn’t the guy,” said William Frohnhoefer, an analyst at BTIG, who added investors have concerns about Ullman. “All the criticism they had leveled at the company before is going to be resuscitated now.” Johnson, previously a well-regarded retailer who pioneered the “cheap chic” concept at Target Corp in the 1990’s before building Apple Inc’s retail chain, had promised at the start of his stint to remake Penney into “America’s favorite department store.” He tried to breathe new life into the 111-year-old chain by replacing its traditional coupons and sales events with everyday low prices. He also carved the retailer’s larger locations into collections of branded boutiques for the likes of Joe Fresh, Jonathan Adler and Martha Stewart. Johnson had plans for 100 such shops at Penney’s 700 locations. While the shop-in-shops have shown promising results, Penney’s price sensitive, deals-obsessed shoppers balked at Johnson’s pricing strategy, which he did not bother to test. Ullman told Reuters in an interview that his first step as returning CEO would be to take a close look at Penney’s books before making any decisions about whether he would forge ahead with Johnson’s shop plan or stop it. “What’s worked well so far is having some attractions within each area,” Ullman said. At the end of fiscal 2012, Penney had $930 million in cash, some $577 million less in cash than a year earlier, despite selling off a number of assets and cutting nearly $1 billion in expenses. Still, he noted, there was something to be said for making the stores more interesting. Johnson’s ouster had been the object of intense speculation for weeks, but Ullman’s return was a surprise, considering how harshly his tenure had been condemned by Penney’s largest shareholder, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who handpicked Johnson and backed his vision. In a May 2012 presentation, Ackman’s Pershing Square called Penney “chronically mismanaged” and noted the stock’s declines during Ullman’s tenure. Its shares fell about 15 percent while he was CEO from 2005 to 2011. Still, when Ullman left, the share price was double Monday’s price. Ullman said Ackman’s criticism was not “entirely balanced” given how hard the 2007-2009 recession hit Penney’s customers. Ackman could not be reached for comment on the latest changes at Penney. But the hedge fund manager did acknowledge last week that the CEO had made “big mistakes,” and that the impact of those mistakes had been “very close to a disaster” for the retailer. At least one retail expert said Ullman’s return might presage a sale of the retailer. “The only reason why I would name Ullman as the CEO would actually be as a temporary fix just because he does know so many people inside the company, and they have faith in them,” said Brian McGough, managing director and head of the retail group at Hedgeye Risk Management. “He could calm waters and he could help to put lipstick on the pig and get it sold.” The latest change in the corner office is expected to cast a harsh light on the board ahead of Penney’s annual meeting on May 17, in Plano, Texas, one corporate governance expert said. “When you get a board that keeps making errors like that, then you start to lose faith not just in the CEO but in the board as well,” said Paul Hodgson, an independent corporate governance analyst in Camden, Maine. Analysts expect shares to be under pressure while Ullman tries to stem the bleeding, especially if that means changing gears abruptly again. “This is like (Tesla co-founder) Elon Musk announcing that Tesla (maker of the first electric car) is changing gears and will now focus on gas-powered vehicles,” said David Tawil, whose hedge fund Maglan Capital had bet Penney’s stock would fall.",4092013,http://www.reuters.com/article/jcpenney-johnson/update-5-j-c-penney-ousts-ceo-mike-ullman-returns-to-helm-idUSL2N0CV1UP20130409

The jury awarded no damages to plaintiff Carol Strum, the company said. Strum, a nurse who claimed her ASR hip was defective, received the implant in 2008 and had it removed in 2011. J&J; voluntarily recalled the ASR hip from the market in August 2010. The company said about 10,750 plaintiffs have direct claims in pending lawsuits over the product. Strum’s case was the second to go to trial. “DePuy’s actions concerning the product were appropriate and responsible, including the program to address patients’ medical costs related to the recall,” said Lorie Gawreluk, a spokeswoman for DePuy.

Newer prescription medicines, including prostate cancer drug Zytiga, psoriasis drug Stelara, and Incivo for hepatitis C made big contributions. J&J; shares rose 1.7 percent to $83.13 in mid-day trading. “Overall, the company’s first-quarter performance was clearly a positive, with pharmaceuticals firing on all cylinders and more than making up for disappointment with medical devices,” said Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark. He was also optimistic that over-the-counter medicines would continue to regain lost ground this year. U.S. sales of over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, including painkillers Tylenol and Motrin, jumped 14 percent, allowing the broader consumer products business to eke out a 2.4 percent sales gain in the quarter. “It’s a strong start to the year that increases the chances that J&J; will meet its 2013 profit forecast,” Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. Sales at the OTC division had plunged over the last three years after J&J; recalled products made at plants in Pennsylvania and Puerto Rico that were shown to have foreign particles or incorrect concentrations of active ingredients. Although costly plant upgrades were still underway, Conover noted other factories have geared up production of Tylenol, Motrin and other OTC products in the meantime, allowing J&J; to restock drugstore shelves. Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said on a conference call with analysts that a “strong flu season” bolstered sales of OTC products.

Global company sales rose 8.5 percent to $17.50 billion, slightly higher than the $17.42 billion expected by Wall Street. They would have risen by 9.8 percent, if not for the stronger dollar, which hurts the value of sales in overseas markets. Prescription drugs sales rose 10.4 percent to $6.77 billion. Stelara sales leapt 57 percent to $346 million, while Incivo’s rose 23 percent to $162 million. Sales of Zytiga jumped 72 percent to $344 million. Global sales of medical devices rose 10.2 percent to $7.06 billion, helped by the addition of new trauma-treating products from its recent acquisition of Synthes Inc.

459,JNJ,Fitch Affirms Johnson & Johnson's IDRs at 'AAA/F1+'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ)  long-term 'AAA' debt ratings. The Rating Outlook is Stable. In addition, Fitch  has affirmed JNJ's short-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'F1+'. A complete  list of JNJ's ratings is provided at the end of this press release. Key Rating Drivers: --The rating action reflects Fitch's expectation that JNJ's broad-based business  model will generate improving operational and financial performance. --Fitch anticipates that JNJ will operate with leverage consistent with its  'AAA' rating and solid liquidity, supported by significant cash balances and  ample access to credit markets. --Fitch forecasts free cash flow (FCF) generation of $7 billion - $7.5 billion  in 2013, driven by 5%-6% sales growth and modestly improving margins. --JNJ's pharmaceutical business has weathered significant patent expiries and  has launched a number of medicines with meaningful sales potential. As such, the  business is positioned for long-term profitable growth.  --Fitch believes that JNJ is proceeding with the Synthes integration as planned  and will be able to drive profitable long-term growth in the acquired business. --The ratings also incorporate anticipated softness in a number of JNJ's  domestic consumer franchises and the cost of the remediation of select  manufacturing issues. Durable Growth: JNJ's recently launched products in its medical device and pharmaceutical  businesses and an expanding pipeline in both businesses support the prospects  for continued growth. In addition, strong demand for many of the company's  products in developing markets should more than offset dampened performance of a  few of JNJ's U.S. consumer and medical device franchises. Other Operational Headwinds to Persist: Select manufacturing problems will likely weigh on revenues and costs in select  franchises in the near term, as JNJ works to remediate these issues. The  expectation for continued weak economic and employment environment will also  moderate growth to varying degrees in most of the company's franchises. In  addition austerity measures in Europe will likely weigh on the company's  revenues and margins that region. Fitch expects these issues will persist at  least through 2013. Synthes Integration: Fitch believes that JNJ is making substantial progress with integrating the  Synthes acquisition. JNJ had a substantial orthopedic franchise, DePuy, before  acquiring Synthes in June 2012. Given the limited overlap in product portfolios,  Fitch continues to view the transaction as strategically sound. In addition to  cross-selling opportunites/greater distribution potential of legacy Synthes  devices, Fitch also expects that JNJ will achieve significant cost synergies  from the integration. Margin Support: Fitch expects JNJ's improving sales mix and continued focus on costs will  support margins. The company's recently approved pharmaceutical products and  continued expansion of its medical device segment will support faster growth for  these segments relative to JNJ's lower-margin consumer business. In addition,  management should continue to focus on generating greater operational  efficiencies in administration, manufacturing and distribution. Solid Liquidity: JNJ has significant liquidity and access to the credit markets. Moderate growth  and relatively stable margins enabled the company to generate $5.85 billion of  FCF [cash flow from operations ($15.40 billion minus capital expenditures ($2.93  billion) and dividends ($6.61 billion)] during the LTM period, ended Dec. 30,  2012.  On Dec. 30, 2012, JNJ had approximately $21.1 billion in cash plus short-term  marketable securities and access to $10 billion in short-term borrowings. JNJ  also had approximately $16.2 billion in debt, including approximately $2.4  billion in commercial paper. JNJ has approximately $1.5 billion of long-term  debt maturing in 2013, $1.8 billion in 2014 $900 million in 2016 and $1 billion  in 2017.  Cash Deployment for Growth and Shareholder Returns: Fitch believes JNJ will remain acquisitive, focusing on targets or products that  offer innovation and growth in the health care sector. The company will likely  finance its transactions within the context of its 'AAA' credit profile.  Shareholder-focused activities, such as dividend increases and share repurchases  are also expected to continue, which Fitch believes will largely be financed  with FCF. Rating Sensitivities: While Fitch does not anticipate a downgrade during its four-year forecast  horizon, a negative rating action could occur if some combination of  deteriorating operational performance and leveraging transactions stress the  company's credit profile. Fitch believes the company's widely diversified health  care related franchises make it more likely that a negative rating action would  be prompted by a leveraging transaction, as opposed to operational stress. Three of the key rating metrics for JNJ's 'AAA' rating that Fitch believes  investors should consider are the following:  --Total debt/FCF of 3.0 times (x) gives no flexibility. --Total debt/EBITDA of 1.0x gives no flexibility. --Net debt of $4 billion - $5 billion gives no flexibility. On Dec. 30, 2012, latest 12 month (LTM) selected credit metrics were as follows. --Total debt/FCF was nearly 2.8x (including one-time adjustments). --Total debt/EBITDA was 0.76x. --JNJ had a net cash position of $4.9 billion.  Fitch affirms JNJ's ratings as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AAA'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'AAA';    --Subordinated debt at 'AAA'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --Commercial paper at 'F1+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to approximately $16.2 billion of debt. Contact: Primary Analyst Bob Kirby Director  +1-312-368-3147  Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

461,JNJ,Illinois jury finds in favor of J&J; in hip implant case,"(Reuters) - An Illinois jury on Tuesday found in favor of Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy orthopedics unit in a second product liability trial of nearly 11,000 lawsuits over the company’s recalled ASR metal hip implant. The outcome contrasts with an earlier separate trial in which a Los Angeles jury ordered the J&J; unit to pay more than $8 million in damages to plaintiff Loren Kransky after finding the company’s ASR hip was defectively designed. DePuy is appealing that verdict. While litigation relating to the metal hips is expected to be expensive, some analysts have said that J&J;, one of the world’s largest healthcare companies with annual revenue of about $70 billion, should be able to weather the costs. The Illinois jury awarded no damages to plaintiff Carol Strum, J&J; said in a statement. Strum, a nurse who claimed her ASR hip was defective, received the implant in 2008 and had it removed in 2011. J&J; voluntarily recalled the product from the market in August 2010, in response to data that showed some ASR patients were undergoing a second hip replacement surgery sooner than expected. The company said about 10,750 plaintiffs have direct claims in pending lawsuits over the product. About 93,000 ASR hips were sold worldwide prior to the recall. “DePuy’s actions concerning the product were appropriate and responsible, including the program to address patients’ medical costs related to the recall,” said Lorie Gawreluk, a spokeswoman for DePuy. Calls to attorneys for the plaintiff were not immediately returned. All-metal implants were developed to be more durable than traditional hip implants, which combine a ceramic or metal ball with a plastic socket, but doctors became concerned about the devices after they were shown to fail more often. The all-metal hips can shed metal debris where two components connect, potentially damaging surrounding soft tissue. The Food and Drug Administration earlier this year issued a proposal calling on companies that make all-metal hip replacements to provide additional information proving they are safe and effective before being allowed to continue selling them. Cases filed in U.S. federal courts have been consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. That trial is set to begin in June.

462,JNJ,J&J; stake sale clouds Royalty bid for Elan,"DUBLIN/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Healthcare firm Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) cut its stake in Elan Corp ELN.N on Thursday in a move that clouds prospects for a $7.3 billion takeover bid for the Irish drugmaker. Investment firm Royalty Pharma on Monday made an improved $12 per share bid for Elan, which has rejected its suitor’s overtures and wants to remain an independent company. However, that offer depended on the outcome of a $1 billion share buyback being conducted by the Irish firm. Royalty had urged Elan’s shareholders to tender shares at between $11.75 and $12 apiece and warned that if they did not, it would reduce its offer. Elan ELN.I said on Thursday it had bought back the targeted amount of stock at the bottom of its indicative price range of $11.25 to $13, with Johnson & Johnson (J&J;) accounting for 92.3 percent of all shares purchased. J&J;, whose stake in Elan has fallen to 4.9 percent from 18 percent, did not give a reason for selling shares in Elan, but said it would make a $213 million gain on its 2009 investment. Royalty said that as a result of the pricing of the buyback, it would lower its offer for Elan to $11.25 a share. At 1:40 p.m. EDT, however, Elan’s shares were up 0.2 percent at $11.9 in New York. Analysts were divided whether this signaled confidence in Elan’s management, or speculation that Royalty would eventually return with a higher bid. “It’s a strong message that the shareholder base of Elan is not thinking about tendering at the $13 level,” said Berenberg Bank analyst Adrian Howd, referring to the top end of the price range proposed by Elan for its share buyback. Elan sold its 50 percent interest in lucrative multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri for $3.25 billion plus future royalties to U.S. partner Biogen Idec (BIIB.O) in February, and wants to spend the bulk of the money on acquisitions. Royalty argues Elan’s management does not have a track record of deals, and has urged the Irish firm’s shareholders to accept its cash offer. It wants to add the royalty rights to Tysabri - worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually - to its large stable of royalty streams. Elan said just 4 percent of shares were tendered in the price range recommended by Royalty. Mirabaud Securities analyst Nick Turner was surprised more Elan shareholders had not tendered shares towards the top end of the indicative range. “Whether they believe they can get a better return out of Elan under current management ... that is not an argument that holds water with me,” he said. The volume of Elan shares changing hands had more than trebled by late morning trading in New York compared with the day before, which some analysts saw as a sign that dealers are still hoping for a higher bid for the company.

464,JNJ,FDA approves J&J; sedation drug device,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators have approved Johnson & Johnson’s Sedasys system to sedate patients during colonoscopies without the need for a physician to monitor delivery of the injectable sedating agent, the company said on Friday. The device injects the patients who have different types of colonoscopy procedures with propofol, a minimal-to-moderate sedation agent widely used in colonoscopy procedures. The system reduces the risks of oversedation when compared to other traditional methods, Johnson & Johnson said in a release, with 99 percent of patients recovering from the effects within 10 minutes after administration of the drug. J&J; said the system is expected to be introduced on a limited basis beginning in 2014. The company estimates that 15 million patients in the United States are candidates for these procedures.

466,JNJ,Fashion's Betsey Johnson goes to therapy in made-for-TV comeback,"LOS ANGELES, May 10 (Reuters) - Mother-daughter therapy, nightly branzino dinners and pulls from a mimosa-filled water bottle at the gym. Welcome to just some of the life of Betsey Johnson, the eccentric and frenetic fashion designer whose personality goes on display in a reality television series beginning on Sunday on U.S. cable network Style. “XOX Betsey Johnson” casts an eye on Johnson, 70, best known for her bright, girly punk dresses, and her daughter Lulu as the inseparable duo look to relaunch their fashion careers after professional and personal setbacks. The eight-episode series is as much a psychological trip through the pair’s emotional high-wire act as it is about the nuts and bolts of the fashion industry. “I think we were always content in our lives, so the joke is ‘Why not do a reality TV show when our lives were completely falling apart?’” Lulu, 38, told Reuters in a joint interview with her mother. For the mother and daughter, who live a few doors apart in the same apartment building on New York’s Upper East Side, their lives were ripping at the inseams. Johnson, who still ends her fashion shows with a trademark cartwheel and split, was forced to shutter her company’s 65 retail stores and file for bankruptcy last year while selling off her brand to footwear giant Steve Madden. “I felt I had lost what I had built and didn’t know if I could continue and get it back,” said Johnson, who is now the creative director behind her brand. Meanwhile, Lulu, a divorced mother, is in the midst of launching her own fashion line. In the first episode, viewers get a taste of a day in the life of the fun-seeking Johnson, whose exercise routine is more flirting with her personal trainer and sipping from her mimosa-filled water bottle than sit-ups and squats. The designer also never misses her favorite meal: a daily dinner of branzino and a half bottle of white wine. But Johnson’s twitchy anxiety about her new gig takes center stage ahead of a big launch party for her Steve Madden brand. “I’ve never had to answer to anyone else,” Johnson admits before the party. “I never was controlled. What I’m most afraid of in terms of having people boss me is my pace; I’m very fast.” Never mind that Johnson is a hit at the party in a billowy, embellished gold lamé gown because the series saves its drama for moments away from the boardroom and catwalk, when Johnson and Lulu butt heads as mother and daughter. “I felt that I really unzipped my soul and kind of squeezed out every bit of who I am, and it was rather painful,” Lulu said of the series. “It was like a really big therapy session.” And therapy sessions are what Johnson dislikes the most. “It’s like taking a shovel to cement to try and get this girl to talk about anything emotionally,” Lulu said about her mother, even after a steady schedule of couples therapy. “I don’t like to talk about my feelings,” Johnson said after one session on the show. “Sometimes Lulu is short with me and it hurts me ... Lulu really loves therapy, I just like to keep going like a race car. Vroom!” Despite an appearance as playful and Pollyannaish as her designs, the show offers a peek into the dogged work ethic of a successful fashion designer who does not know how to stop. “My work has driven my life,” Johnson said. “I’ve gone through husbands and boyfriends and I can go through anything as long as I have my work.” In the end, Johnson said she found her therapy in an unexpected place: shooting the series over several months beginning last August. “The filming was such a great, wonderful support system for me when I had kind of failed at the business,” Johnson said. “I think I would have been really miserable if I didn’t have the show because it kept me going and it kept me in the spotlight.” Style is part of NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast Corp.

467,JNJ,RPT-U.S. House panel questions resignation of top FDA official,"By Toni Clarke May 13 (Reuters) - A U.S. House of Representatives panel is investigating the circumstances surrounding the resignation from the Food and Drug Administration of its acting deputy commissioner for medical products and tobacco. In a letter to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg on Monday, Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee demanded more information about the role played at the agency by Dr Leona Brenner-Gati, a former Johnson & Johnson executive, who resigned from the FDA on May 3. Between February 2013 and April 2013, the FDA’s public calendar listed Brenner-Gati as acting deputy commissioner for medical products and tobacco, with no significant meetings, the letter noted. Yet an organizational chart from March 4 listed the position as vacant. Brenner-Gati continued to be listed on the FDA’s public calendar into April 2013, and the FDA Web page for the Office of Medical Products and Tobacco, last updated on March 22, listed her as the acting deputy commissioner. The discrepancies “raise questions about whether she was actively working in her position over the last two months, and the circumstances surrounding her resignation,” the letter said. An FDA spokeswoman, Erica Jefferson, declined to comment on the letter. Brenner-Gati joined the FDA in September 2012 as associate commissioner of medical products and tobacco, according to an internal memo from Hamburg on May 3 announcing her departure. She took over as acting deputy commissioner in January. “Dr. Brenner-Gati has played a key leadership role in many critical ongoing initiatives,” Hamburg wrote. Public records list Brenner-Gati’s residence as Princeton Junction, New Jersey, close to Johnson & Johnson’s headquarters in New Brunswick. A message left on her answering-machine at that home was not returned. It was not immediately clear where she lived while working at the FDA, which is based in Silver Spring, Maryland. “Several days before her resignation, Committee staff could not locate Dr. Brenner-Gati on the online HHS employee directory,” the letter said, referring to the Department of Health and Human Services, of which the FDA is a part. It added that she was not featured on the FDA’s leadership profiles. According to a profile published on the website of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, a non-profit organization which she helped found, Brenner-Gati previously held a variety of senior positions in science and technology at Johnson & Johnson and had a special interest in diabetes and endocrinology. At the company, according to the Alliance, she identified a new technology involving cell therapy in diabetes, which led to the formation of BetaLogics, a Johnson & Johnson venture. Brenner-Gati served on its board. Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, and leaders of its oversight and investigations subcommittee, asked Hamburg to explain whether Brenner-Gati was placed on administrative leave, and if so, to explain when and why and indicate whether she was paid during the leave. They also asked Hamburg to describe Brenner-Gati’s responsibilities and accomplishments since she became acting deputy commissioner, and they asked for all documents related to her financial disclosures. They also asked for all documents from FDA ethics officials related to Brenner-Gati, and all documents related to her hiring for positions at the FDA. In her May 3 memo, Hamburg told employees that Brenner-Gati had brought “invaluable experience with innovation in science, technology, medicine and healthcare; excellent leadership and management expertise; and personal attributes, including her collaborative spirit, drive, and interpersonal skills, that will be sorely missed.” Brenner-Gati earned a B.A. in biology from Princeton University and a medical degree from Harvard Medical School.",5142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/fda-management/rpt-u-s-house-panel-questions-resignation-of-top-fda-official-idUSL2N0DV1SC20130514

Simponi is already approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Like RA, ulcerative colitis is an auto-immune disease in which the body’s immune system attacks its own organs. In the case of ulcerative colitis, inflammation can lead to open sores or ulcers in the lining of the colon, causing stomach pain, gastrointestinal bleeding and diarrhea. The most common side effects of Simponi in clinical trials of patients with ulcerative colitis were upper respiratory infection and redness at the site in which the drug is injected. Patients treated with Simponi, known also as golimumab, are at increased risk of developing serious infections, reactivation of Hepatitis B infection, heart failure and certain nervous system disorders. The drug is marketed by J&J;’s Janssen Ortho Biotech unit.

472,JNJ,New J&J; anti-depressant related to 'Special K' party drug,"NEW BRUNSWICK, New Jersey (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said it plans to seek approvals for 11 new drugs by 2017, including a treatment for patients with depression who have failed to benefit from standard medications. The intranasal drug, called esketamine, is closely related to a pediatric anesthetic called ketamine that has been shown in academic studies to ease symptoms rapidly in such patients, including a reduction in suicidal thoughts. Ketamine is also the active ingredient of the mood-altering party drug known as “Special K.” J&J;, which is testing its tweaked version of ketamine in mid-stage trials, on Thursday said initial findings have been promising. Yale University researchers have described ketamine as the biggest breakthrough against depression in the past half-century, theorizing that the anesthetic helps rejuvenate connections between brain cells called synapses that have been damaged by stress and depression. “The results have been truly remarkable,” Husseini Manji, head of neuroscience at Johnson & Johnson, said of the studies conducted at Yale on ketamine. Manji said esketamine could be very important for depressed patients who have become suicidal, because it works so quickly. “Today you basically treat people and lock them up until the drugs take effect.” The Yale research shows ketamine takes effect within hours. By contrast, standard drugs can take weeks or months to improve symptoms. But the Yale researchers have cautioned that ketamine can cause short-term psychosis if used in large doses. J&J; spokesman Greg Panico said the company’s altered form of ketamine is given in small doses through an intranasal spray. Details about the depression drug emerged on Thursday at an all-day meeting with hundreds of analysts and fund managers at J&J;’s headquarters in New Brunswick, New Jersey, held to discuss trends for its pharmaceuticals business. J&J; said it will also seek approvals by 2017 for drugs to treat hepatitis C, immune diseases and schizophrenia, and vaccines for flu, rabies and polio. The company, citing industry statistics, said total global sales of prescription drugs are expected to grow 4.5 percent annually until 2017. Peter Rabover, an analyst with Scharf Investments in Scotts Valley, California, said J&J;’s array of experimental drugs suggests company pharmaceutical sales will outpace the market. “To me, it looks like they can grow 6 to 9 percent a year for the next five years,” Rabover said. The diversified healthcare company said it is conducting mid-stage trials of a new type of drug for heart failure, a debilitating and hard-to-treat condition in which the heart is unable to supply blood adequately to the rest of the body. The drug mimics a protein called Beta 1-Adrenergic Receptor. J&J; is wading back into the heart-failure field after the collapse of its older treatment, called Natrecor, which J&J; spent billions of dollars to acquire. It became a big seller after being launched in 2001, but was virtually abandoned years later after studies questioned its safety and effectiveness. Company prescription drugs have rebounded in the past two years following generic competition for Risperdal and J&J;’s Topamax epilepsy treatment. Sales of J&J; drugs rose 4 percent last year and by 10 percent in the first quarter of 2013, thanks to brisk-selling new treatments for prostate cancer, blood clots, diabetes and other diseases. “Pharma is now J&J;’s most attractive segment because they have moved past patent expirations and have a large number of new products,” said Jeff Jonas, an analyst with Gabelli & Co. The company’s other two businesses - consumer products and medical devices - are also growing, but have been plagued by product recalls. Company shares have jumped 26 percent so far this year, versus an 18 percent gain for the drug sector.

473,JNJ,UPDATE 4-New J&J; anti-depressant related to 'Special K' party drug,"* Depression drug would target worst-case patients * J&J; says fast-acting drug may help avert suicides * J&J; to seek approvals for flu, rabies, polio vaccines By Ransdell Pierson NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., May 23 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson  said it plans to seek approvals for 11 new drugs by 2017, including a treatment for patients with depression who have failed to benefit from standard medications. The intranasal drug, called esketamine, is closely related to a pediatric anesthetic called ketamine that has been shown in academic studies to ease symptoms rapidly in such patients, including a reduction in suicidal thoughts. Ketamine is also the active ingredient of the mood-altering party drug known as “Special K.” J&J;, which is testing its tweaked version of ketamine in mid-stage trials, on Thursday said initial findings have been promising. Yale University researchers have described ketamine as the biggest  breakthrough against depression in the past half-century, theorizing that the anesthetic helps rejuvenate connections between brain cells called synapses that have been damaged by stress and depression. “The results have been truly remarkable,” Husseini Manji, head of neuroscience at Johnson & Johnson, said of the studies conducted at Yale on ketamine. Manji said esketamine could be very important for depressed patients who have become suicidal, because it works so quickly. “Today you basically treat people and lock them up until the drugs take effect.” The Yale research shows ketamine takes effect within hours. By contrast, standard drugs can take weeks or months to improve symptoms. But the Yale researchers have cautioned that ketamine can cause short-term psychosis if used in large doses. J&J; spokesman Greg Panico said the company’s altered form of  ketamine is given in small doses through an intranasal spray. Details about the depression drug emerged on Thursday at an all-day meeting with hundreds of analysts and fund managers at J&J;’s headquarters in New Brunswick, New Jersey, held to discuss trends for its pharmaceuticals business. J&J; said it will also seek approvals by 2017 for drugs to treat hepatitis C, immune diseases and schizophrenia, and vaccines for flu, rabies and polio. The company, citing industry statistics, said total global sales of prescription drugs are expected to grow 4.5 percent annually until 2017. Peter Rabover, an analyst with Scharf Investments in Scotts Valley, California, said J&J;’s array of experimental drugs suggests company pharmaceutical sales will outpace the market. “To me, it looks like they can grow 6 to 9 percent a year for the next five years,”  Rabover said. The diversified healthcare company said it is conducting mid-stage trials of a new type of drug for heart failure, a debilitating and hard-to-treat condition in which the heart is unable to supply blood adequately to the rest of the body. The drug mimics a protein called Beta 1-Adrenergic Receptor. J&J; is wading back into the heart-failure field after the collapse of its older treatment, called Natrecor, which J&J; spent billions of dollars to acquire. It became a big seller after being launched in 2001, but was virtually abandoned years later after studies questioned its safety and effectiveness. Company prescription drugs have rebounded in the past two years following generic competition for Risperdal and J&J;’s Topamax epilepsy treatment. Sales of J&J; drugs rose 4 percent last year and by 10 percent in the first quarter of 2013, thanks to brisk-selling new treatments for prostate cancer, blood clots, diabetes and other diseases. “Pharma is now J&J;’s most attractive segment because they have moved past patent expirations and have a large number of new products,” said Jeff Jonas, an analyst with Gabelli & Co. The company’s other two businesses - consumer products and medical devices - are also growing, but have been plagued by product recalls. Company shares have jumped 26 percent so far this year, versus an 18 percent gain for the drug sector. They have been helped by enthusiasm for J&J;’s improving drug lineup and the steady return of recalled consumer medicines, including Tylenol, to store shelves.

475,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson recalls Cilest birth control pills,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is voluntarily recalling about 32 million packages of its birth control pill Cilest in Europe, Asia and Latin America, a spokeswoman said late on Tuesday, the latest in a string of recalls over the past two years. Cilest is manufactured by Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc, a unit of Johnson & Johnson. Spokeswoman Michelle Romano said the recall of 179 batches was initiated because one active ingredient in Cilest did not lead to a “defined specification” in one routine internal test. Media reports have said the tests showed one of the two hormones in Cilest was being released more slowly than intended. The pill is available in 43 countries, but is not sold in the U.S. Cilest contains two hormones that are similar to the natural hormones estrogen and progesterone. Cilest, which women use to avoid unwanted pregnancies, works by preventing the release of eggs from the ovary. The product remains safe and effective, Romano said, adding that there is no risk for the women who had taken the pill. Less than 800,000 individual consumer packets remain available for sale, she said. The recall, of which wholesalers and pharmacies were notified in the week of May 27, involves pills that were manufactured in or after 2011. The company did not issue a formal press release announcing the recall. “The recall is at the wholesale and pharmacy level and this is not a patient level recall,” Romano said. In the past two years J&J; has recalled over-the-counter drugs, contact lenses, heart devices, and insulin pump cartridges. In March J&J;’s LifeScan unit recalled and replaced nearly 2 million meters used to measure blood glucose levels in diabetics due to a failure to operate properly at extremely high glucose readings.

477,JNJ,J&J;'s Stelara effective in psoriatic arthritis trial,"June 11 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara produced significant improvement in signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis through 52 weeks of treatment in a late stage study, according to data being presented at a medical meeting in Europe. The Phase III trial tested Stelara at two doses against a placebo in 312 patients with active psoriatic arthritis, and included both subjects who had previously been treated with widely used biotech drugs from a class known as anti-TNF medicines and those who had not. At week 52, 46.8 percent of those who received the 45 milligram dose of Stelara and 48.4 percent of those to got 90 mg had at lease a 20 percent reduction in arthritis symptoms, such as swollen and tender joints - a measure known as ACR 20. The company had previously reported results through 24 weeks of treatment in which nearly 44 percent of those who received  Stelara at either dose achieved ACR 20 versus 20.2 percent who reached ACR 20 in the placebo group. The result was deemed to be highly statistically significant. Nearly 56 percent of the placebo patients who crossed over and began taking 45 mg Stelara at week 24 had achieved ACR 20 by week 52, researchers said. The data was being presented at the European League Against Rheumatism meeting in Madrid this week. Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which joint pain is caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissues. It affects about 30 percent of those who suffer from the painful and unsightly skin condition psoriasis. Many patients are treated with anti-TNF drugs such as AbbVie’s  Humira and J&J;’s own Remicade. Researchers also measured ACR 50 and ACR 70 scores, representing 50 and 70 percent improvement in symptoms. For those who received 45 mg of Stelara, 27.7 percent reached ACR 50 and 12.8 percent hit 70 percent improvement after 52 weeks. At 90 mg, 26.3 percent achieved ACR 50 and nearly 18 percent hit ACR 70. For those patients who started on placebo and took Stelara from week 24 through week 52, 28.6 percent achieved ACR 50 and 15.6 percent reached ACR 70, researchers said. Stelara, known chemically as ustekinumab, is already approved to treat psoriasis. The medicine is currently under review for a psoriatic arthritis approval in the United States and Europe. “One of the major unmet needs in psoriatic arthritis is for patients who have an inadequate response to anti-TNF agents or who for whatever reason cannot take anti-TNFs who really don’t have good alternatives,” Dr. Christopher Ritchlin, the study’s lead investigator, said in a telephone interview. “Those of us who treat large numbers of these patients have been struggling with options,” said Ritchlin, who will present the study results on Wednesday. “Now we have another agent besides anti-TNF agents that can provide relief for the skin and joints. These data add a new option that we didn’t have before,” he said. Stelara proved more effective in patients who did not receive prior treatment with anti-TNF drugs, researchers said. However, they noted that previously treated patients had more active disease at the start of the trial. The drug was well tolerated with no deaths or cases of tuberculosis reported, researchers said. Serious adverse events were reported in 5.8 percent of Stelara patients, they said.",6112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/johnsonandjohnson-arthritis/jjs-stelara-effective-in-psoriatic-arthritis-trial-idUSL2N0EN20D20130611
478,JNJ,J&J; in $1 billion deal to bolster prostate-cancer focus,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said it would pay up to $1 billion for Aragon Pharmaceuticals and its experimental drugs for prostate cancer, to bolster J&J;’s role in the field after it acquired another experimental prostate-cancer treatment four years ago that has become a leading brand. J&J; on Monday said Aragon’s lead product, called ARN-509, has potential to help patients whose prostate cancer has not yet spread to other parts of the body, as well as patients whose cancer has spread. By contrast, J&J;’s blockbuster Zytiga treatment, acquired through its $1 billion purchase of Cougar Biotechnology in 2009, was approved in 2011 only for patients whose cancer has already spread. Moreover, although Zytiga has become a blockbuster only two years after being launched, it could face competition from cheaper generics by 2016 in the United States, while ARN-509 will have U.S. marketing exclusivity until 2028, Leerink Swann analyst Danielle Antalffy said in a research note. “We expect that J&J; will be able to accelerate ARN-509’s development timeline and expand the depth of clinical programs in order to reach the market ahead of Zytiga’s U.S. patent expiration,” Antalffy said. Zytiga and ARN-509 are both meant for patients who fail to benefit from treatments that block testosterone, the male hormone that fuels prostate cancer. But the two drugs work differently. ARN-509 has potential to be the most effective treatment for such patients, Antalffy said. J&J; spokeswoman Kellie McLaughlin said late-stage trials will be needed to assess how ARN-509 would be used. But she said the drug and Zytiga potentially could work well when used in combination because of their slightly different mechanisms of action. “They might also be studied to see if they can be used sequentially, with patients first taking ARN-509 and then moving on to Zytiga as their disease progresses,” McLaughlin said. ARN-509, which belongs to a new class of drugs called androgen receptor signaling inhibitors, works in a similar way to Medivation Inc’s already approved Xtandi treatment. But Antalffy said early clinical data suggest ARN-509 has potential to be more potent, and to sidestep seizure risks seen with the Medivation drug. Aragon will receive $650 million in cash upfront from J&J; under the deal, and a possible second payment of $350 million if ARN-509 meets certain milestones. The deal does not include development of Aragon’s treatment for breast cancer, which will be spun off into a separate company called Seragon Pharmaceuticals ahead of the deal and will be run by Aragon’s chief executive officer. McLaughlin said Zytiga has had the most successful introduction of any oral treatment for cancer, having been used by more than 60,000 patients worldwide. It generated first quarter sales of $344 million, putting it on track toward full-year sales well above the $1 billion J&J; paid for Cougar Biotechnology. “Prostate cancer is a key area of focus for us, and we are really excited about ARN-509 and adding it to our portfolio,” McLaughlin said. Shares of J&J; closed up 0.8 percent to $85.63 on the New York Stock Exchange, outpacing a 0.3 percent gain for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers.

481,JNJ,S&P; retreats after eight days of gains as Coca-Cola drags,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 snapped its eight-day winning streak on Tuesday after disappointing sales from Coca-Cola, while investors turned cautious on the day before the Federal Reserve chairman’s congressional testimony. The market’s pullback came a day after both the Dow and the S&P; 500 ended at record closing highs for the third consecutive session. Tuesday’s volume was below average at 5.5 billion shares traded on exchanges, but above Monday’s 4.91 billion, which was the lightest of any full trading day this year. Eight of the 10 S&P; 500 industry sector indexes declined, with materials shares among the day’s worst performers. Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) was the biggest drag in terms of points on the S&P; 500 after the world’s largest soft drinks maker reported weaker-than-expected second-quarter sales, which it blamed on economic malaise and unusually cold and wet weather. The stock, which was the Dow’s biggest percentage loser, fell 1.9 percent to $40.23. “I think you’re going to see a lot of companies that are coming in just barely meeting their earnings expectations and again reporting reduced revenues, and I think that’s the crux of the problem with our economy,” said Brian Amidei, managing director at HighTower Advisors in Palm Desert, California. Investors are eager to hear Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s testimony about monetary policy on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. His comments will be closely analyzed for signs of when the central bank may start reducing its stimulus efforts. Bernanke’s comments in late May, which raised the prospect of trimming the Fed’s $85 billion in monthly stimulus, triggered a brief selloff and interrupted this year’s rally. The S&P; 500 is still up 17.5 percent since December 31. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI slipped 32.41 points, or 0.21 percent, to end at 15,451.85. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX declined 6.24 points, or 0.37 percent, to finish at 1,676.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 8.99 points, or 0.25 percent, to close at 3,598.50. The day’s economic data showed that U.S. consumer prices picked up in June. The overall U.S. Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent, the largest gain since February, after inching up 0.1 percent in May. U.S. homebuilder confidence rose in July to its strongest level in 7-1/2 years. Financial stocks, which started the day as outperformers, also dropped despite strong earnings from Goldman Sachs (GS.N). The S&P; financial sector index .SPSY fell 0.4 percent. Goldman Sachs reported quarterly profit doubled as the bank made more money trading bonds before an interest-rate spike hit markets in June. But Goldman’s stock slid 1.7 percent to $160.24 as investors fretted that the results could not be easily repeated. In other earnings reports, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) shares were flat at $90.40 after the Dow component reported higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Strong sales of prescription drugs and medical devices more than offset anemic growth of its consumer products, Johnson & Johnson said. Analysts expect S&P; 500 companies’ second-quarter earnings to have grown 3 percent from a year earlier, with revenue up 1.5 percent, data from Thomson Reuters showed. Shares of Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) sank 14.3 percent to $109.05 after Goldman Sachs Group Inc set a new price target far below the stock’s current trading price. After the bell, shares of Yahoo YHOO.O slipped 2.7 percent to $26.15 following the release of its results. In Tuesday’s regular session, Yahoo shares fell 1.7 percent to $26.88. The day’s volume was well below the average daily closing volume for the year of about 6.4 billion shares on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and the NYSE MKT. Decliners outpaced advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1. On the Nasdaq, about 14 stocks fell for every 11 that rose.

482,JNJ,J&J; results beat forecasts; Elan share sale helps,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on strong demand for its prescription drugs and medical devices, but a big gain from the sale of a stake in Irish drugmaker Elan Corp ELN.I skewed the results. “It looks like it was a great quarter, when it was really only a good quarter,” Edwards Jones analyst Judson Clark said. J&J; posted a second-quarter gain of $213 million from the sale of Elan shares it acquired in 2009 as part of a deal to develop a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. The diversified healthcare company, whose shares were little changed in afternoon trading, said it earned $3.8 billion, or $1.33 per share. That compared with $1.41 billion, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier, when J&J; took $2.2 billion in charges for the writedown of research assets, litigation expenses and merger-related costs. J&J; earned $1.48 per share, excluding special items such as expenses from litigation and an acquisition. Analysts on average expected $1.39, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said the earnings beat estimates because of surprisingly strong sales, a lower tax rate, improved profit margins and the Elan gain. Revenue rose 8.5 percent to $17.88 billion, while Wall Street had been expecting $17.71 billion. Global sales of the company’s prescription drugs rose 11.7 percent to $7.02 billion, on strong performances of Remicade for arthritis, Stelara for psoriasis and Zytiga, a fast-growing medicine for prostate cancer. Sales of medical devices rose 9.6 percent to $7.19 billion, helped by the company’s recent acquisition of Synthes Inc and its devices used for trauma procedures. “This report shows that concerns about growth of J&J;’s device business are overblown,” said Bill Smead, chief investment officer of Smead Capital Management. But sales of consumer medicines edged up only 1.1 percent, to $3.66 billion, with weakness in both in U.S. and overseas markets. U.S. sales continue to suffer from recalls of Tylenol, Motrin and other over-the-counter medicines over the past three years due to quality-control lapses. J&J; raised its full-year earnings forecast to between $5.40 and $5.47 per share from an earlier range of $5.35 to $5.45. It earned $5.10 per share last year.

488,JNJ,"Energizer loses two battery accounts, will buy a J&J; unit","(Reuters) - Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR.N) said on Wednesday that two U.S. retailers planned to stop selling its batteries, adding pressure to its sagging sales. Shares of Energizer fell, even as the company maintained its full-year profit forecast due to cost savings. The company also said it planned to buy Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) feminine care brands in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean for $185 million. The acquisition of the o.b. tampon, Stayfree pad and Carefree liner product lines would give Energizer greater heft against Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and Kimberly-Clark Corp’s (KMB.N) feminine care brands. Energizer said it expected sales in its household products division to fall by more than 10 percent in the current fiscal fourth quarter, largely because two U.S. retailers will no longer sell its batteries. Shares of Energizer were down 4.2 percent at $100.54 in afternoon trading. “The Energizer battery brand is caught in between the low-end brands like a Rayovac or private label, which are much cheaper, and the high-end brands like a Duracell, that is a little more expensive but spends a lot more on its brand,” Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. Rayovac batteries are made by Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc (SPB.N), and Duracell batteries are made by Procter & Gamble (PG.N). Energizer reported a higher-than-expected profit for its fiscal third quarter despite a slight drop in sales, and it announced plans to raise its quarterly dividend by 25 percent to 50 cents a share. While Energizer did not say which retailers were dropping its batteries, Family Dollar said this month that P&G;’s Duracell would become the only national battery brand in its stores. Energizer Chief Executive Ward Klein, speaking on a conference call on Wednesday, suggested that the losses had to do with retailers that focus on one exclusive brand or the other, and said it is “not a new phenomenon.” Typically, warehouse club stores carry only one name brand, with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) selling P&G;’s Duracell and Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s (WMT.N) Sam’s Club selling Energizer. Early last year, Energizer lost shelf space for batteries at the Walmart chain, which it said was a short-term issue. Wal-Mart is Energizer’s biggest customer, accounting for about 20 percent of the company’s fiscal 2012 sales. Representatives for Wal-Mart’s Walmart U.S. division and Sam’s Club were not immediately available for comment. While Energizer is best known for its batteries, it derives a larger percentage of sales and profits from its personal care products, such as Schick razors, Banana Boat sunscreen and Playtex tampons. The acquisition of J&J;’s brands could help Energizer gain attention in the feminine care aisle, often dominated by P&G;’s Always and Tampax brands, and other rivals such as Kimberly’s Kotex. Energizer entered the feminine care business in 2007, when it acquired Playtex Products Inc. Energizer said it expected the deal, which includes a manufacturing plant in Montreal, to close this quarter and that it should add modestly to earnings next year. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) was the company’s financial adviser on the acquisition. J&J; said it remains committed to its feminine care business outside of North America. Energizer said it earned $87.2 million, or $1.38 per share, in the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, up from $70.2 million, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings, which exclude items such as restructuring costs, rose to $1.57 per share from $1.18 and topped analysts’ average forecast of $1.32, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales slipped to $1.11 billion from $1.12 billion, missing the analysts’ average forecast of $1.14 billion, as competitors’ promotions and a wet summer curbed demand for products like suntan lotion. Energizer said it still expected fiscal-year adjusted earnings of $6.75 to $7.00 per share, helped by additional savings from the restructuring it announced in November. The St. Louis-based company’s plans include cutting more than 10 percent of its workforce. It now expects to save more than $80 million this fiscal year, up from a May target of $50 million to $60 million. After posting double-digit percentage increases in adjusted earnings per share for two years, Energizer said it expected to report mid-single-digit growth in fiscal 2014.

489,JNJ,J&J; puts Chinese businesses under local chairman,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said on Tuesday the business heads of its three Chinese operations would begin to report to one local chairman next month in an effort to increase sales and centralize corporate oversight. The reorganization comes as pharmaceutical companies are in the spotlight in China after the government began investigating bribery accusations against British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L)(GSK.N). The diversified healthcare company said Jesse Wu, worldwide chairman of its consumer business, will become chairman of J&J; China, reporting directly to company Chairman and Chief Executive Alex Gorsky. The three Chinese operations have been reporting to separate business heads in the United States. Each of the three China units will still be responsible for determining its own business strategies, but each general manager and president in China will report to Wu, the company said. Lynn Pendergrass, a Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) senior vice president overseeing the printing and personal systems businesses for the Americas, will join J&J;, taking over Wu’s job as head of the J&J;’s global consumer business. J&J; spokesman Ernie Knewitz said the changes in China will help increase sales and add oversight to the “whole enterprise” there. “Now it is all segmented like the rest of the world,” Knewitz said. “You report through steps to the worldwide chairman of your unit,” based in the United States. Wu will oversee an operation that includes 9,000 employees in China and $2.5 billion in sales last year. Knewitz said J&J; created a similar reporting structure in Vietnam last year and has been considering it for China over the past year in hopes of boosting profitability. The changes come amid widening investigations in China of Western drugmakers for bribery and improper marketing of prescription drugs, including arrests of GlaxoSmithKline executives, and reported ongoing investigations of other industries. J&J; said its new structure in China was not prompted by concerns it would be targeted for probes by Chinese authorities. Knewitz said he was unaware of any current investigations of J&J; in China by authorities. “It definitely adds additional, and centralized, oversight for our whole enterprise in China, but the emphasis is on growing our business,” Knewitz said of the new structure. J&J; is one of the world’s largest and most diversified healthcare companies, selling an array of prescription drugs, medical devices and consumer products. It gives wide latitude to the three primary business units and to various companies under its corporate umbrella. But the decentralized approach has been blamed in large part for J&J;’s widespread quality control problems that sparked repeated U.S. recalls over the past three years of many consumer products, including painkillers Motrin and Tylenol. To fix the quality-control failures, J&J; is revamping large factories in Pennsylvania and Puerto Rico. But its reputation has been tarnished by the recalls as well as by recalls of artificial hips whose metal materials have dissolved or broken away and caused serious injuries, and other products.

494,JNJ,J&J; hunts for dengue fever drugs in tie-up with academia,"LONDON (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is joining the hunt for drugs to treat dengue fever - the world’s fastest-spreading tropical disease - by linking with academic researchers in Belgium and the Wellcome Trust medical charity. There is currently no drug treatment or vaccine for the mosquito-borne viral disease, which is also called “breakbone fever” because of the severe pain it can cause. The tie-up between J&J;’s Janssen unit and researchers at the University of Leuven, who have received backing from Wellcome, will build on the discovery of a series of chemical compounds that are highly potent in preventing the replication of dengue virus. The compounds, which have yet to be tested in clinical trials, are active against all four types of the virus and have been shown to work in animal tests. While testing them in humans will take many years, the new alliance marks a vote of confidence in the feasibility of making an effective dengue medicine. J&J; already has a proven track record in developing other antiviral medicines, including treatments for HIV and hepatitis C. The partners said on Thursday that J&J; would make an undisclosed upfront payment and milestone payments based upon the achievement of development, regulatory and sales goals. Experts estimated in April that there may be as many as 390 million dengue infections around the world each year, although not all patients get seriously sick. Current approaches to treating the condition are focused on alleviating symptoms. Spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, dengue has grown rapidly along with urbanization and globalization because it thrives in tropical mega-cities and is easily spread in goods containing small puddles of water, such as used tires. Climate change is also making more parts of the planet habitable for the dengue-spreading mosquito. As a result, half the world’s population is now exposed to the disease - mostly in the developing world, but also in parts of southern Europe and the southern United States. Last year Europe experienced its first sustained transmission of dengue fever since the 1920s with around 2,000 people infected in the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira. Hopes for an effective dengue vaccine suffered a setback last year when an experimental shot from Sanofi proved less effective than hoped in a mid-stage clinical trial in Thailand. Further large trials of the vaccine - the most advanced in development - are still continuing and scientists have not given up hope that it may yet have a role to play, while Sanofi is stepping up its production.

496,JNJ,J&J; kicks off $5 billion clinical diagnostics unit sale: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson has launched a sale process for its Ortho Clinical Diagnostics unit, which makes blood screening equipment and laboratory blood tests and could fetch around $5 billion, three people familiar with the matter said on Friday. J&J; has asked JPMorgan Chase & Co to run the sale and is preparing to send detailed financial information in coming weeks to potential buyers, including some of the world’s largest private equity firms and a number of healthcare companies, the people said. Early estimates suggest the unit’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization are between $400 million and $500 million, suggesting a possible valuation of roughly $5 billion, the people said. The unit, whose tests are considered older and less profitable than modern molecular diagnostics that examine gene mutations for signs of disease, has annual sales of about $2 billion. The people asked not to be identified discussing details of the process. J&J; declined to comment, while a JPMorgan spokeswoman had no immediate comment. Healthcare conglomerate J&J; said in January it would explore strategic alternatives for the unit and cautioned that the process could take anywhere from about 12 to 24 months. Industrial and healthcare conglomerates General Electric and Danaher Corp. are likely to take a serious look at bidding for the J&J; business, said one of the sources and another who had heard about the sales process. GE declined to comment. A call to Danaher was not immediately returned. J&J;’s decision to divest the division comes as drugmakers are shedding businesses and cutting costs due to overseas price controls and pressure on payments from insurers and the government. Pfizer Inc, for instance, just spun off its animal health products business, and Abbott Laboratories split off its branded drugs unit early this year. Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, whose revenue growth has been relatively flat, is No. 5 in the clinical diagnostics market, as measured in sales. Typically, J&J;’s businesses rank first or second in their respective markets. Clinical diagnostics are less attractive than molecular diagnostics, which could see strong revenue growth in coming years as examination of genes helps doctors steer patients to appropriate treatments. But some analysts, including Les Funtleyder of Poliwogg, have said private equity buyers might be interested in the stable cash flow the J&J; unit could provide.

497,JNJ,J&J; unit issues U.S. recall of Motrin drops for infants,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s consumer healthcare unit said on Friday it is recalling about 200,000 bottles of concentrated Motrin drops for infants due to potential contamination with plastic particles. The company is asking U.S. retailers to remove the affected half-ounce bottles of original berry flavored drops from store shelves. It said consumers should dispose of any recalled product they may have and suggested they contact the company about refunds. Three lots are being recalled because plastic particles, about the size of a poppy seed, were identified during the manufacturing of a fourth, undistributed, lot of the drops. J&J; said it determined that the particles originated in a shipment from a third party supplier of ibuprofen, the active ingredient in the Motrin drops. The company said in a statement that it has worked with that supplier to ensure that corrective measures are in place, and said use of the drops is unlikely to cause adverse medical reactions. In 2010, J&J; took more than 40 nonprescription products off store shelves, including Children’s Tylenol, after investigators identified problems at its Fort Washington, Pennsylvania manufacturing plant, in what the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has characterized as the largest recall of children’s medicine in the agency’s history. The company agreed in July to pay $22.9 million to end a lawsuit from investors who claimed it concealed quality-control failures.

504,JNJ,Sizzling drug sales help Johnson & Johnson beat third-quarter forecasts,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, as strong growth for prescription drugs overshadowed weaker contributions from its medical device and consumer products businesses. “The company’s pharmaceuticals division is really well placed with lots of new drug launches at a time when the company is not facing many patent expirations on its other medicines,” Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. “And we expect to see more of this strength in the next several quarters.” Global drug revenue jumped almost 10 percent to $7.04 billion, repeating the strong performance seen in the prior quarter, on soaring sales of its Simponi and Remicade treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, Stelara for psoriasis, its Zytiga drug for prostate cancer and other medicines. But sales of the company’s medical devices were hurt by patients’ continuing reluctance to undergo elective surgeries and other procedures in a weak economy. Division sales fell 2 percent to $6.93 billion. “The weakness in devices appears to be broad based, with not just one thing bringing them down,” Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark said, adding that the unit’s weakest category was medical diagnostics. All things considered, Clark said J&J; is one of the best-performing companies in healthcare. J&J;’s shares have risen almost 30 percent for the year to date, compared with a 17 percent gain for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index .DRG of large U.S. and European drugmakers. ^^^^^^For graphic on Q3 results, see link.reuters.com/cud83v Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso, on a conference call with industry analysts on Tuesday, said there has been a pickup in overall economic activity, “but certainly not to the level we had hoped.” Caruso said J&J; was interested in acquiring or licensing new prescription drugs to sustain strong growth of its top-performing business. He said J&J; was also on the hunt for new medical devices, including those that treat structural heart defects, if they can be bought at reasonable prices. The diversified healthcare company on Tuesday reported net earnings of $2.98 billion, or $1.04 per share, for the quarter. That compared with $2.97 billion, or $1.05 per share in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, J&J; earned $1.36 per share. Analysts on average, had expected $1.32 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company took special charges of about $900 million in the quarter, related largely to legal expenses and merger-related costs. Sales of consumer products edged up 0.8 percent to $3.61 billion, held back by disappointing demand for oral care and wound-care products. Within the consumer division, sales of over-the-counter medicines rose 6.4 percent to $975 million, as recalled brands such as Tylenol and Motrin began returning to U.S. drugstore shelves. J&J; over the past three years has recalled dozens of OTC products made at its plants in Pennsylvania and Puerto Rico that were shown to have foreign particles or incorrect concentrations of active ingredients. Costly plant upgrades are still under way, as J&J; strives to make the affected products at other plants. Overall company sales rose 3.1 percent to $17.58 billion in the quarter, above Wall Street expectations of $17.46 billion, but would have risen 4.7 percent if not for the stronger dollar.

505,JNJ,UPDATE 3-Sizzling drug sales help J&J; beat third-quarter forecasts,"By Ransdell Pierson Oct 15 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, as strong growth for prescription drugs overshadowed weaker contributions from its medical device and consumer products businesses. “The company’s pharmaceuticals division is really well placed with lots of new drug launches at a time when the company is not facing many patent expirations on its other medicines,” Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. “And we expect to see more of this strength in the next several quarters.” Global drug revenue jumped almost 10 percent to $7.04 billion, repeating the strong performance seen in the prior quarter, on soaring sales of its Simponi and Remicade treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, Stelara for psoriasis, its Zytiga drug for prostate cancer and other medicines. But sales of the company’s medical devices were hurt by patients’ continuing reluctance to undergo elective surgeries and other procedures in a weak economy. Division sales fell 2 percent to $6.93 billion. “The weakness in devices appears to be broad based, with not just one thing bringing them down,” Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark said, adding that the unit’s weakest category was medical diagnostics. All things considered, Clark said J&J; is one of the best-performing companies in healthcare. J&J;’s shares have risen almost 30 percent for the year to date, compared with a 17 percent gain for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers. Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso, on a conference call with industry analysts on Tuesday, said there has been a pickup in overall economic activity, “but certainly not to the level we had hoped.” Caruso said J&J; was interested in acquiring or licensing new prescription drugs to sustain strong growth of its top-performing business. He said J&J; was also on the hunt for new medical devices, including those that treat structural heart defects, if they can be bought at reasonable prices. The diversified healthcare company on Tuesday reported net earnings of $2.98 billion, or $1.04 per share, for the quarter. That compared with $2.97 billion, or $1.05 per share in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, J&J; earned $1.36 per share. Analysts on average, had expected $1.32 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company took special charges of about $900 million in the quarter, related largely to legal expenses and merger-related costs. Sales of consumer products edged up 0.8 percent to $3.61 billion, held back by disappointing demand for oral care and wound-care products. Within the consumer division, sales of over-the-counter medicines rose 6.4 percent to $975 million, as recalled brands such as Tylenol and Motrin began returning to U.S. drugstore shelves. J&J; over the past three years has recalled dozens of OTC products made at its plants in Pennsylvania and Puerto Rico that were shown to have foreign particles or incorrect concentrations of active ingredients. Costly plant upgrades are still under way, as J&J; strives to make the affected products at other plants. Overall company sales rose 3.1 percent to $17.58 billion in the quarter, above Wall Street expectations of $17.46 billion, but would have risen 4.7 percent if not for the stronger dollar. J&J; said it expects earnings this year, excluding special items, of $5.44 to $5.49 per share, up from its prior view of $5.40 to $5.47. The company earned $5.10 per share last year.

508,JNJ,U.S. guidelines expand potential uses of J&J; TB drug,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - New federal guidelines expand the range of patients who might benefit from Johnson & Johnson’s Sirturo drug for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), the first new type of TB drug to win U.S. regulatory approval in more than 40 years. The recommendations, issued on Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, go beyond the narrow group of adults listed in the drug’s label, offering advice on use of the treatment in children, pregnant women and individuals with other health complications, such as diabetes and HIV infection. The guidance on how best to use Sirturo comes as rates of MDR-TB continue to climb, said Dr. Sundari Mase of the CDC’s TB elimination branch and lead author of the guidelines, published in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Although TB infection is rare in the United States, it has become a global public health threat as poor oversight of available drugs has spawned strains of the bacterium that resist treatment by all but a handful of drugs. In its annual TB report issued this week, the World Health Organization said 8.6 million people developed TB in 2012 and 1.3 million died from the disease. It warned that 3 million people with TB are being missed by health systems, and drug-resistant “superbug” strains of the bacterial infection have put progress against TB at risk. According to the report, 450,000 people fell ill with MDR-TB in 27 countries in 2012, with China, India and Russia worst affected. “Right now, the United States is the only country in the world implementing this drug and rolling it out,” Mase said, adding that China is close behind. The drug, known generically as bedaquiline, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last December for MDR-TB as part of combination therapy in adults over the age of 18 with TB infections of the lung. The approval was based on the available data, but the drug had not been studied in other populations at high risk for the infection. The CDC’s guidelines offer advice on so-called “off label” uses of the treatment for categories of patients with drug-resistant strains of TB that have not yet been studied, said Mase. She noted that most drugs used to treat TB are “off label.” “Our expert consultants felt that the lack of data did not necessarily mean the drug should not be used in these populations if the risk of not getting appropriate treatment would lead to a really poor outcome - death or (serious illness),” Mase said. Clinical trials of the J&J; drug showed an increased risk of death among patients who got the treatment compared with a placebo group, data Mase said the panel weighed carefully. When the FDA approved the treatment, it did so with the caveat that J&J; must collect detailed data on its use, closely tracking side effects. Mase said the available data do not reveal a clear pattern of deaths to show they were caused by bedaquiline. “Given that safety concern was there, the group thought if we closely monitor patients and are able to pick up serious adverse events, and side effects are reported and investigated quickly, there should be no reason to limit who gets the drug just based on the increase in all-cause mortality,” she said. Treating typical TB cases is a long process, with patients needing to take a cocktail of powerful antibiotics for six months. Many patients fail to complete their treatment, a factor which has fueled a rise in the drug-resistant forms. “The overriding imperative is that this drug be used appropriately,” Chrispin Kambili, global medical affairs leader for J&J;’s Janssen division, said in a telephone interview. Kambili said the CDC guidelines and those that the World Health Organization released in June include careful language intended to safeguard the drug from the development of drug resistance, as has happened with many of the existing antibiotics that have been used to treat TB over the years. Among leaders in TB, Kambili said, “there is a lot of agreement that we have to take care of this almost rare occurrence where a new TB drug has been introduced” so that “the risk of squandering this drug is minimized.” The new CDC guidelines add more specifications for monitoring patients and require that the J&J; drug be used with at least four other drugs in patients whose lab tests show they have MDR-TB, and it must be used with five other TB drugs in patients with less clear diagnoses. The panel also said that for certain patients, the drug could be used for longer than 24 weeks, even though it has not been studied in patients for longer than that. Mase said the panel felt if a patient has been doing well with the first 24-week course of treatment, “there should be no reason not to extend treatment beyond 24 weeks.” The guidelines also specify dosing, the importance of direct observation to ensure treatment is taken consistently, and the need for doctors to use the treatment only in consultation with an expert in MDR-TB, which will help the CDC keep close tabs on how the drug is used.

510,JNJ,FDA advisory panel backs approval of J&J;'s hepatitis C drug,"(Reuters) - An advisory committee of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted unanimously to approve Johnson & Johnson’s hepatitis C drug, J&J; said on Thursday. The panel voted 19-0 in favor of the drug, simeprevir, which was tested in combination with standard hepatitis C drugs, peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin. The drug is being developed by J&J; unit Janssen Research & Development LLC. It is being tested in adults who failed previous interferon-based therapy or had not received medication at all. The FDA usually follows the recommendation of the advisory panel, although it is not obligated to do so. Hepatitis C, an infection of the liver transmitted through the blood, kills more than 15,000 Americans each year, mostly from hepatitis C-related illnesses such as cirrhosis and liver cancer.

512,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson to pay $2.2 billion to end U.S. drug probes,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In one of the largest health care fraud settlements in U.S. history, Johnson & Johnson will pay $2.2 billion to end civil and criminal investigations into kickbacks to pharmacists and the marketing of pharmaceuticals for off-label uses, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said on Monday. The resolution of the long-running case covers the marketing of the anti-psychotic drugs Risperdal and Invega and the heart drug Natrecor over several years. From 1999 through 2005, J&J; and its subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc promoted Risperdal for unapproved uses, including controlling aggression and anxiety in elderly dementia patients and treating behavioral disturbances in children and in individuals with disabilities, according to the complaint. The off-label marketing cost U.S. government insurance programs hundreds of millions of dollars in uncovered claims, the complaint said. Under the settlement, Janssen will plead guilty to a single misdemeanor violation for its promotion of Rispersdal. Meanwhile, the company paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to Omnicare Inc, the nation’s largest pharmacy specializing in dispensing drugs to nursing home patients, under various guises including “educational funding.” Johnson & Johnson’s conduct “recklessly put at risk” the health of children, dementia patients and others to whom the drug was prescribed at a time it was only approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat schizophrenia, Holder said. Janssen’s sales representatives “aggressively” promoted Risperdal to doctors and other prescribers who treated elderly dementia patients, and through a special “ElderCare sales force” targeted nursing home operators. “The company also provided incentives for off-label promotion” and based sales representatives’ bonuses on total sales, not just sales for FDA-approved uses, the DOJ said. Under FDA regulations, doctors may prescribe drugs for unapproved, or off-label, use. But pharmaceutical companies are allowed to market their drugs in the United States only for FDA-approved uses. The FDA said it had delivered repeated warnings to Janssen about “misleading marketing messages” to doctors, and later initiated a criminal complaint. “Our investigators devoted considerable time and resources to this case, to help ensure that pharmaceutical companies do not mislead healthcare providers and the general public,” John Roth, director of the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, said in a statement. As part of the settlement, Justice Department lawyers filed a civil complaint against Johnson & Johnson in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on Monday. Johnson & Johnson said that the settlement of “the civil allegations is not an admission of any liability or wrongdoing, and the company expressly denies the government’s civil allegations.” Monday’s settlement also resolved allegations that J&J; and a subsidiary, Scios Inc., marketed Natrecor for off-label uses not approved by the FDA and not covered by federal healthcare programs. J&J; disclosed in a securities filing in 2011 it had reached an agreement to resolve criminal penalties related to the promotion of Risperdal, which was once one of the company’s biggest sellers, but that certain issues remained open. The company on Monday said no additional charges will be recorded to earnings in connection with the settlement. J&J; shares were down about 0.9 percent in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. “We reached closure on complex legal matters spanning almost a decade,” said Michael Ullmann, general counsel of Johnson & Johnson. Most large drugmakers have had to pay major fines to the U.S. government and various states over the past decade for alleged improper marketing of their medicines. Pfizer Inc in 2010 agreed to pay $2.3 billion to settle allegations it improperly marketed 13 drugs, including kickbacks to healthcare providers. Last year, Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline Plc agreed to pay $3 billion to resolve criminal charges that it improperly targeted its Paxil depression treatment to children, sold its Wellbutrin antidepressant for unapproved uses and failed to inform U.S. regulators of safety risks seen with its Avandia diabetes drug. Glaxo is now under the microscope of Chinese police, who in recent months alleged it has participated in a widespread bribery and corruption scheme in which the company used travel agencies to funnel illegal payments to doctors and government officials to bolster drug sales. Other drugmakers this year have also come under scrutiny in China, both for marketing practices and drug prices, but Glaxo has suffered the most damage from the scandal as many Chinese doctors have shunned its sale representatives. Glaxo’s drug sales in China plunged 61 percent in the third quarter.

522,JNJ,UPDATE 1-J&J; reaches $4 bln deal on hip implant lawsuits -report,"Nov 12 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson will pay more than $4 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits over its recalled defective hip implants, Bloomberg reported late on Tuesday, citing three people familiar with the deal. Johnson & Johnson declined to comment on the report. The deal will resolve more than 7,500 lawsuits brought against J&J;’s DePuy orthopedics unit in federal and state courts by patients who have already had the defective devices removed, the report said. De Puy recalled thousands of its metal ASR hip systems due to higher-than-expected failure rates. Plaintiffs claim that defective metal-on-metal devices caused pain, discomfort and more serous complications, including increased levels of metal ions in the bloodstream. The devices were introduced in the United States in 2005, and DePuy recalled the product in 2010 after selling an estimated 93,000 units worldwide. Data from the UK at the time showed that about 12 percent of the implants needed to be replaced after five years. Metal implants were developed to be more durable than traditional hip implants, which combine a ceramic or metal ball with a plastic socket. All-metal implants can shed metallic debris, potentially damaging bone and soft tissue, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

524,JNJ,"UPDATE 1-U.S. FDA approves J&J;, Pharmacyclics lymphoma drug","By Bill Berkrot Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Wednesday approved a drug to treat a rare and aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma developed by Johnson & Johnson and Pharmacyclics Inc, becoming the second drug that had received the FDA’s new breakthrough therapy designation to gain approval. The drug, to be sold under the brand name Imbruvica, and known chemically as ibrutinib, was approved to treat mantle cell lymphoma in patients who have received prior treatment with at least one other medicine, such as Celgene Corp’s  Revlimid. It works by inhibiting an enzyme needed by the cancer to multiply and spread. Mantle cell lymphoma, which represents about 6 percent of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases in the United States, has typically spread to lymph nodes, bone marrow and other organs by the time it is diagnosed, the Food and Drug Administration said. The FDA earlier this month approved Roche’s Gazyva to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), another type of blood cancer, making it the first drug approved after receiving the breakthrough designation. The FDA gives a breakthrough designation when it believes a medicine may offer a substantial improvement over existing therapies for serious or life-threatening diseases. “The agency worked cooperatively with the companies to expedite the drug’s development, review and approval, reflecting the promise of the breakthrough therapy designation program,” Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA’s Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, said in a statement. Imbruvica is also awaiting an approval decision to treat  CLL, which some analysts believed would come at the same time as the U.S. lymphoma approval. “This is a relative short-time disappointment versus Wall Street expectations for simultaneous approval in both indications with a broad label,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said in a research note. Yee, in an email, said RBC is forecasting long-term annual worldwide sales of $5 billion for Imbruvica. Pharmacyclics shares were up $3.20, or 2.6 percent, at $122.87 on Nasdaq. Shares of Johnson & Johnson were down 85 cents, or 0.9 percent ,at $92.71 on the New York Stock Exchange.",11132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/fda-lymphoma/update-1-u-s-fda-approves-jj-pharmacyclics-lymphoma-drug-idUSL2N0IY1F020131113

Depuy recalled the ASR hip system in 2010, after data suggested that it failed at a higher-than-expected rate. At the time, the company had sold about 93,000 systems worldwide. Metal hip implant systems like Depuy’s ASR hips were designed to be more durable, replacing a traditional metal-on-plastic ball-and-socket design. Instead, some patients who received the ASR hips reported experiencing pain, swelling, joint dislocation and sometimes damage to the central nervous system, thyroid and heart. The settlement would compensate plaintiffs who have undergone surgery to replace their hips as of Aug. 31, 2013, the company said Tuesday. The company estimated that 8,000 plaintiffs would be eligible. There is no cap on the amount of individual claims, according to Peter Flowers, one of the lead lawyers for the plaintiffs. Eligible U.S. plaintiffs can seek compensation for costs associated with their revision surgery, as well as payments of qualified liens by healthcare providers associated with the surgery, Flowers said. Plaintiffs who experienced more serious complications can apply to receive additional funds, Flowers said. “From my clients’ perspective, this has been a long time coming,” Flowers said. Plaintiffs who opt not to participate in the program, or those who have not undergone revision surgery to replace their implants, will continue to litigate. The company said it will continue to defend itself in the remaining lawsuits not resolved by the agreement. It also said that it expected the cost of the settlement program to be covered by reserves it had previously set aside, and did not expect to record an additional charge in connection with the agreement. “The U.S. settlement program provides compensation for eligible patients without the delay and uncertainty of protracted litigation,” said Andrew Ekdahl, president of Depuy Synthes Joint Reconstruction, in a statement.

The announcement comes just weeks after Johnson & Johnson announced it would pay $2.2 billion to resolve civil and criminal probes into its marketing of several medications, including the anti-psychotic drug Risperdal. While the settlement announced Tuesday aims to end a substantial chunk of the ASR hip litigation, Johnson & Johnson is still facing more than 5,000 lawsuits in connection with its Pinnacle hip implants.

532,JNJ,J&J; chooses two bidders for diagnostics sale negotiations: sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) and a consortium of Danaher Corp (DHR.N) and Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) have advanced to the final stage of negotiations for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) diagnostics unit, according to people familiar with the matter. These two bidders appear willing to pay the most for the unit, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, though a deal may now value it at up to $4 billion, less than the $5 billion J&J; was initially hoping for, the people said on Thursday. Other private equity firms, including Bain Capital LLC, BC Partners Ltd and a consortium of CVC Capital Partners Ltd and Leonard Green & Partners LP, considered the valuation too high given the unit’s lack of growth and are no longer in talks with J&J;, the people added. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the sale process is confidential. J&J; and Danaher did not respond to requests for comment. Carlyle, Blackstone, Bain, BC Partners, CVC and Leonard Green declined to comment. The diagnostics unit makes blood screening equipment and laboratory blood tests that are considered older and less profitable than modern molecular diagnostics. It also makes tests that can reveal a patient’s blood type and screen for viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C. It is a small player in a market led by larger rivals such as Roche Holding AG ROG.VX, Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) and Danaher. J&J; said in January it would explore strategic alternatives for the unit and cautioned that the process could take anywhere from 12 months to 24 months. It asked JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to run the sale of the unit, Reuters previously reported. J&J;’s decision to divest the division comes as drugmakers are shedding businesses and cutting costs in response to overseas price controls and pressure on payments from insurers and the government.

534,JNJ,U.S. FDA approves J&J; hepatitis C pill,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Friday approved the use of Johnson & Johnson’s Olysio, also known as simeprevir, as a treatment for chronic infection with the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus. Olysio, a protease inhibitor that blocks a specific protein needed by the virus to replicate, is to be used in combination with interferon, given by injection, and ribavirin, another pill. Hepatitis C affects about 3.2 million Americans, killing more than 15,000 each year, mostly from illnesses such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. The often-undiagnosed virus is transmitted through contaminated blood. Infection rates have dropped since the early 1990s, due in part to the introduction of blood and organ screening. Still, many older adults remain at risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has called for baby boomers to be routinely tested for the virus. Olysio is a member of the same class of drugs as Merck & Co’s Victrelis and Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ Incivek. The FDA approved both those drugs in 2011. Olysio was shown in clinical trials to cure patients with a shorter duration of treatment. Drugmakers have been racing to develop more effective, easier-to-tolerate antivirals to treat hepatitis C. Wall Street analysts have forecast annual sales of billions of dollars for new drugs that would allow doctors to skip use of interferon, which can cause severe flu-like side effects. The FDA is slated to decide by December 8 on Gilead Sciences’ application for sofosbuvir, a member of a different class known as nucleotide analogue inhibitors, or “nukes,” designed to block a different enzyme the virus needs to copy itself. European regulators on Friday recommended approval of the Gilead drug, under the brand name Sovaldi. Other companies working to develop new hepatitis C drugs include AbbVie and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

Trading is expected to be light this week, with markets closed Thursday for Thanksgiving, and closing early on Friday. The light action could increase market volatility. The CBOE Volatility index is down more than 30 percent this year, and is at historically low levels, which could make it vulnerable to a spike. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P; 500 have rallied in recent months, closing out their seventh straight week of gains last week. Both indexes closed at records on Friday, with the S&P; closing above 1,800 for the first time. The gains have largely come on expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will maintain its stimulus program through the year-end. While the program is expected to provide a floor under equity prices for as long as it continues, the scale of the rally has some investors looking for a pullback amid few catalysts. The S&P; is 1.4 percent above its 14-day moving average, which could serve as support in a correction. “It won’t take much for these gains to fade given the rally we’ve seen, especially in such a slow week,” said Jeff Duncan, chief executive of Duncan Financial Management in St. Louis. “The Fed is holding steady, but a lot of investors have become complacent, buying for no real fundamental reason.” U.S. crude futures fell 1.3 percent after a breakthrough nuclear deal between world powers and Iran over the weekend eased oil supply fears. Brent crude fell 1.6 percent. The decline in the price of oil could weigh on energy companies, though it may benefit other segments of the economy, like consumer spending. U.S. shares of BP Plc fell 0.6 percent in premarket trading. “Less tension in the Middle East is always a positive, and any drop in gas prices will essentially act as a tax break for consumers going into the holiday shopping season,” Duncan said. “This is a real benefit for the economy.” S&P; 500 futures rose 5.6 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added 58 points and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 11 points.

543,JNJ,"J&J;, Pharmacyclics leukemia drug effective long term: study","(Reuters) - A closely watched leukemia drug developed by Johnson & Johnson and Pharmacyclics Inc maintained its effectiveness in keeping the disease at bay for most patients, according to long-term follow-up data from a midstage study being presented at a major medical meeting. The oral drug, ibrutinib, last month won U.S. approval to treat a rare and aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma known as mantle cell lymphoma. It is awaiting a Food and Drug Administration decision on treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a slowly progressing form of blood cancer that primarily affects people aged 65 and older. Some industry analysts had expected the CLL approval to come at the same time as the lymphoma decision. Data from this and other studies being presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting in New Orleans could give regulators additional comfort about the medicine’s safety and effectiveness in treating CLL. “Patients receiving ibrutinib are doing much better than historically what we’re used to seeing with CLL,” Dr John Byrd, a co-leader of the study, said in a telephone interview. The 148-patient ibrutinib extension study looked at both previously untreated CLL patients and those who had relapsed or stopped responding following prior therapies. With a median follow-up of more than 27 months of treatment, nearly all of the previously untreated, or treatment-naive, patients and almost three quarters of the relapsed and refractory patients had no evidence of the disease progressing. “With extended follow-up the remissions with ibrutinib appear to be continuing and the safety of this long-term is being maintained,” said Byrd, professor of internal medicine and director of hematology at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center in Columbus. “There has not been an increase of infections or other late-term complications, suggesting that it’s going to be a drug that patients can take for a continued, extended period of time without it being a detriment,” he added. Researchers had not yet been able to determine median progression-free survival - the point at which the disease begins to worsen for half the patients in a study. Among previously untreated patients, about 96 percent had not yet experienced disease progression, with just one of 31 patients in that group relapsing so far, researchers said. Typically you would expect about 50 percent to see disease progression at two years, Byrd explained. “You don’t even need a statistician to see the difference. The data are better,” he said. Of the 117 previously treated patients in the extension study, 21 had experienced disease progression and 11 had died within 30 days of receiving their last dose of the drug. That left more than 70 percent whose disease remained in check. “Ibrutinib is the single most active drug that’s come into the clinic for CLL in terms of the durability of remission induced with it, so it’s going to be a game-changer in CLL,” Byrd predicted. “A lot of the patients from the initial phase II study have been on drug for two to three years,” he added. Serious adverse side effects, such as pneumonia, declined after the first year of treatment, researchers said. The incidence of serious side effects was twice as high in patients who had received prior therapies, which may have had more to do with the state of their disease than a reaction to ibrutinib, they said. “Long term follow-up has only shown a low risk of infection that you would expect to see in this patient population,” said Byrd. “Otherwise the safety has been very favorable relative to other things that have been used in this patient population.” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee is forecasting eventual annual worldwide sales of $5 billion for the medicine, now being sold for lymphoma under the brand name Imbruvica. About 15,000 Americans are diagnosed with CLL each year, according to ASH. While there are effective treatments for the disease, such as chemotherapy combined with Roche’s Rituxan, current therapies can be highly toxic. Ibrutinib is one of several new medicines for CLL - including one in late stage development from Gilead Sciences Inc - that have fewer toxicities and safety issues and may lead to better quality of life for patients being treated. “The future will hold combining this with some of the other new targeted therapies that we have coming forward to get complete remissions and hopefully get us onto the path of cure,” Byrd said.

Ibrutinib is one of several new medicines for CLL - including one in late stage development from Gilead Sciences Inc  - that have fewer toxicities and safety issues and may lead to better quality of life for patients being treated. “The future will hold combining this with some of the other new targeted therapies that we have coming forward to get complete remissions and hopefully get us onto the path of cure,” Byrd said.",12082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/pharmacyclics-johnsonandjohnson-leukemia/jj-pharmacyclics-leukemia-drug-effective-long-term-study-idUSL2N0JJ2IU20131208

Carlyle is in exclusive talks with Johnson & Johnson after prevailing over a rival bid from Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) in partnership with healthcare and industrial conglomerate Danaher Corp (DHR.N), the people said, cautioning that negotiations were ongoing and the outcome could change. A deal is expected to be reached within the next two weeks, one of the sources said. The exact price of Carlyle’s offer could not be learned. The sources asked not to be identified because details of the sale process are confidential. Carlyle, Johnson & Johnson and Blackstone declined to comment. A Danaher representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. J&J;’s ortho clinical diagnostics unit makes blood-screening equipment and laboratory blood tests. It also makes tests that can identify a patient’s blood type and screen for viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C. The unit is a small player in a market led by larger rivals such as Roche Holding AG ROG.VX, Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) and Danaher. Johnson & Johnson said at the beginning of the year it would explore strategic alternatives for the unit and said the process could take from 12 to 24 months. It asked JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to run the sale of the unit, Reuters previously reported. Johnson & Johnson’s decision to divest the division comes as drugmakers are shedding businesses and cutting costs in response to overseas price controls and pressure on payments from insurers and the government.

554,JNJ,"J&J;, Pharmacyclics leukemia drug improves survival in study","(Reuters) - An independent committee recommended a late stage trial of a cancer drug developed by Pharmacyclics Inc and Johnson & Johnson be stopped early as it became clear it helped patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) live longer, paving the way for additional approval of the medicine. The announcement of the study’s early success by Pharmacyclics on Tuesday sent its shares soaring 20 percent higher and took J&J; shares up by nearly 2 percent. The independent monitoring committee, upon reviewing interim results of the trial called Resonate, unanimously recommended it be stopped as ibrutinib was deemed assured of meeting both the primary goal of significantly delaying progression of the disease and the secondary goal of extending survival in patients with relapsed CLL compared with those taking GlaxoSmithKline’s Azerra (ofatumumab). The committee also recommended that ibrutinib be made available to patients taking the Glaxo drug in the study. Ibrutinib was approved for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November to treat a rare form of blood cancer called mantle cell lymphoma under the brand name Imbruvica. But some analysts and investors were disappointed the agency did not simultaneously approve it for CLL, instead setting an approval decision date of February 28. “We believe the IDMC move to stop the study early will resonate quite profoundly with the FDA,” Roth Capital Partners analyst Joseph Pantginis said in a research note. Ibrutinib had received the FDA’s new breakthrough therapy designation given to experimental drugs deemed to be potentially important advances in treating serious diseases. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Matthew Andrews said in a note that the monitoring committee decision “may provide FDA with additional regulatory leeway to approve Imbruvica (for CLL) before February 28.” Independent monitoring committees regularly conduct interim analyses of clinical trials and can either recommend the study continue as planned or be stopped early due to safety concerns or because data shows the study drug will clearly succeed in meeting the goals of the trial. Pharmacyclics said it has informed the FDA of the committee’s recommendations, while J&J; was providing the information to European health regulators. The safety of the drug in the Phase III trial of 391 patients who had failed to be helped by prior therapy was consistent with that seen in prior studies, the company said. Pharmacyclics shares were up $20.86, or 19.8 percent, at $125.92 in midday trading on Nasdaq, while J&J; shares were up $1.62, or 1.7 percent at $93.95 on the New York Stock Exchange.

J&J;’s view on naming of biosimilars contrasts that of Mylan Inc and Novartis AG over the past few months, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continues to work on drafting regulations for the approval of biosimilars — cheaper versions of expensive biologics, or the original reference drugs. “Assigning names that are similar but not the same will appropriately reflect the legal and scientific reality that biosimilars are similar to but not the same as their reference products or other biosimilars,” J&J;’s Chief Biotechnology Officer Jay Siegel said in a statement. Creating copies of biologics is complicated as these products are produced in living cells, bringing inevitable unpredictability. As a result, their copies can only ever be “similar,” not exact replicas. Names of biosimilars are also bound to impact their sales and adoption as substitutes to the original products. Novartis and Mylan have both previously expressed support for a system that requires that a biosimilar share the same international non-proprietary name (INN) as the biologic products to which it refers, saying that same names would avoid frivolous brand tactics and confusion in the marketplace. Mylan in September said it supported a petition filed by the Washington, DC-based Generic Pharmaceutical Association that recommended biosimilars have the same names because by definition they are highly similar to their reference products and have no meaningful differences that require a unique name. Novartis advocated for the same by filing its own petition in October. Biologic medicines, typically administered via an injection, and are used to treat cancers, immunological diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis and other chronic illnesses, but their high price tag can keep them out of reach for many patients.

560,JNJ,FDA staff cautious about J&J;'s latest Xarelto application,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration appears skeptical that data submitted by Johnson & Johnson proves its anticoagulant Xarelto is effective in reducing the risk of further heart problems in patients who have recently suffered a heart attack. The agency questioned the way in which J&J; analyzed clinical trial data, and said there was no convincing proof the drug confers significant benefit or fills an unmet medical need, given that there are other therapies on the market. The review was posted on the FDA’s website on Tuesday, two days ahead of a meeting of outside experts who will discuss the drug, also known as rivaroxaban, and recommend whether it should be approved. Xarelto is already used to treat and prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms and to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in patients with an irregular heart beat that is not caused by heart problems. Now the company is hoping it will also be approved for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), an umbrella term covering any condition brought on by a sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart, including heart attack and chest pain.

561,JNJ,UPDATE 2-FDA staff cautious about J&J;'s latest Xarelto application,"By Toni Clarke WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration appears skeptical that data submitted by Johnson & Johnson proves its anticoagulant Xarelto is effective in reducing the risk of further heart problems in patients who have recently suffered a heart attack. The agency questioned the way in which J&J; analyzed clinical trial data, and said there was no convincing proof the drug confers significant benefit or fills an unmet medical need, given that there are other therapies on the market. The review was posted on the FDA’s website on Tuesday, two days ahead of a meeting of outside experts who will discuss the drug, also known as rivaroxaban, and recommend whether it should be approved. Xarelto is already used to treat and prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms and to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in patients with an irregular heart beat that is not caused by heart problems. Now the company is hoping it will also be approved for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), an umbrella term covering any condition brought on by a sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart, including heart attack and chest pain.

563,JNJ,UPDATE 1-U.S. FDA panel rejects J&J; drug for acute coronary syndrome,"By Toni Clarke WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s  anticoagulant Xarelto should not be approved to prevent further heart problems in patients who have recently suffered a heart attack, an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded on Thursday. The panel voted 10 to 0, with one abstention, that data presented by the company from a single clinical trial was not strong enough to justify approval, especially since some data from was missing. The FDA is not bound to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so. Xarelto is already used to treat and prevent deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms and to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in patients with an irregular heart beat that is not caused by heart problems. The company had hoped to also win approved for its use in  patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), an umbrella term covering any condition brought on by a sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart, including heart attack and chest pain. The vote follows a negative review from staff at the FDA whose report, published on Tuesday, noted that there was no proof the drug confers significant benefit. Dr. Paul Burton, vice president of clinical development at Janssen Research and Development, a J&J; unit, said in a statement that the company will “work with the FDA to address questions raised today.” J&J; originally filed for approval of Xarelto in ACS at the end of 2011. The FDA rejected the application, citing missing data, and said the trial results were not strong enough to support approval. The company retrieved some missing data but the FDA once again declined to approve the drug, prompting J&J; to appeal the decision. The FDA denied the appeal but said limiting the duration of use to one month might be a pathway forward because efficacy was more evident and the risk of bleeding, a side effect of the drug, was lower during this period. J&J; filed a new application seeking a treatment duration of 90 days. Panelists said the inclusion of J&J;’s additional data did not alter their view that the benefit of the drug was not shown to outweigh an increased risk of bleeding. Neither did they think it was possible to carve out a 90-day time frame from the overall clinical data and make definitive conclusions about the drug’s safety or efficacy. “Looking at the overall study it wasn’t robust enough in terms of statistical significance to be considered a positive study, and with that it was not possible to look at subgroups,” said Dr. Philip Sager, consulting professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr. Stephen Grant, deputy director of the FDA’s division of cardiovascular and renal drugs, said the benefit of the drug met the criteria required to approve a drug based on a single trial - namely, proof it was superior in some way to existing products.

567,JNJ,J&J; to sell slow-growing diagnostics unit to Carlyle,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said on Thursday it would sell its ortho clinical diagnostics unit to buyout firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) for $4.15 billion, shedding a slow-growing business to focus on more lucrative products. A major deal in the private equity world, the sale is small change for J&J;, which has a market value of $267 billion and assets spanning pharmaceuticals, medical devices and consumer products. Analysts said the move highlighted J&J;’s determination not to waste resources on unloved divisions. “Now with this divestiture nearly complete, we’re inclined to believe (J&J;) will continue to strategically prune its business segments and use the proceeds to return cash to shareholders or invest in higher-growth assets,” Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy wrote in a note. J&J;’s diabetes business, which includes LifeScan blood glucose meters and Animas pumps, could be the next business to go, given slowing sales growth and weak margins, Antalffy said. J&J; shares were down marginally at $94.53 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Reuters reported in December that Carlyle was nearing a deal to buy the business, trumping a joint bid from Blackstone Group (BX.N) and Danaher Corp (DHR.N). Carlyle was attracted to the unit’s potential to grow in emerging markets, according to a person familiar with the firm’s thinking who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Washington, D.C.-based Carlyle plans to reinvigorate the unit’s product lines, invest further in research and development, and grow the sales force, the person added. J&J; said in January 2013 that it was considering a sale or spinoff of the unit, whose products include equipment for laboratory diagnostics and blood transfusion screening. J&J;’s businesses typically rank first or second in their markets. The diagnostics unit was ranked fifth among competitors based on sales, according to Thomson Reuters data. “This transaction is a result of our disciplined approach to portfolio management in order to achieve the greatest value for Johnson & Johnson,” Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said in a statement. Drugmakers around the world are getting rid of non-core businesses as a way to cut costs in the face of pricing and reimbursement pressures from cash-strapped governments. “I don’t get the sense that they’re going to follow the path of a Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) and kind of break up further. My sense is they’re probably going to do some more of this slight restructuring,” Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. The deal is Carlyle’s biggest healthcare investment since it bought Manor Care Inc, a nursing, hospice and home health services provider, in 2007 for $6.3 billion. Corporate carve-outs represent complex transactions for private equity as the acquired units can be deeply integrated in a parent company’s finance, technology, logistics and human resources operations. Carlyle, however, has experience with such carve-outs. In February 2013, it acquired DuPont’s DD.N performance coatings business for $4.9 billion. In December 2012 it acquired, together with BC Partners Ltd, the former Hamilton Sundstrand industrial products businesses of United Technologies Group (UTX.N) for $3.46 billion.

571,JNJ,"J&J; cautious view on 2014 profit, drug sales, hits shares","(Reuters) - Healthcare company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) cautioned Tuesday that prescription-drug sales would likely lose some momentum this year and forecast 2014 earnings at the lower end of Wall Street expectations, sending its shares down almost 2 percent. Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso cautioned that the growth rate of prescription drug sales will “decelerate” this year, from impressive 11 percent gains in 2013 that were fueled by use of newer treatments for psoriasis, arthritis and cancer. The company announced the outlook during a meeting with investors to review its fourth-quarter financial results, which beat Wall Street expectations on strong drug sales and an upturn in sales of consumer products. “Things looked solid in the quarter,” said Edward Jones analyst Judson Clark. “Pharmaceuticals have been strong for a while, but medical devices and diagnostics also picked up steam versus Wall Street’s expectations.” J&J; said it expects to earn $5.75 to $5.85 per share in 2014, excluding special items, compared with analysts’ forecasts at the top end of that range. “The guidance was a little disappointing, but management tends to be conservative with their initial forecast,” gradually raising its profit views during the year, Clark said. Sanford Bernstein analyst Derrick Sung said concerns about J&J;’s forecast were “overdone,” and he cited “a very strong operational performance” by the company in the fourth quarter. Caruso said price pressures on J&J;’s array of products, particularly in Europe, would crimp company profit margins this year by 0.5 percent, as was the case last year. But he said an additional $1 billion in accrued cost cuts over the next three years would help offset that negative trend. Sales of prescription drugs have been “exceptional,” Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said in a meeting with industry analysts. They jumped 11.8 percent to $7.3 billion in the quarter, helped by price increases and demand for Remicade and Simponi for rheumatoid arthritis, Stelara for psoriasis and Zytiga for prostate cancer. The company, whose products span everything from medical devices to over-the-counter painkiller Tylenol, earned $3.52 billion, or $1.23 per share, in the fourth quarter. That was well above the $2.57 billion, or 91 cents per share, it earned in the year-earlier period, when J&J; took a charge of $800 million related mostly to its recall of defective hip implants. Excluding special items, J&J; earned $1.24 per share. Analysts, on average, expected $1.20 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Global company sales rose 4.5 percent to $18.36 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $17.95 billion. They would have risen 6.3 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in overseas markets. Remicade sales jumped 13.8 percent to $1.71 billion. Simponi sales soared 40 percent to $254 million, while Stelara sales jumped 55 percent to $417 million. But sales of Concerta, a treatment for attention deficit disorder that is now facing cheaper generics, tumbled 31 percent to $169 million. Sales of consumer products, including Listerine, Aveeno skin care products and over-the counter medicines such as Tylenol and Motrin, grew almost three percent in the quarter to $3.75 billion, after relatively flat sales in the prior quarter. The company’s other big business, of medical devices and diagnostics, posted a 1 percent decline in sales to $7.3 billion, against a 2 percent decline in the prior quarter. “There are early signs of improvement in areas like orthopedics,” Gorsky said, adding he remained confident in long-term growth of the business. J&J;’s DePuy orthopedics business is struggling to regain its footing following costly recalls of its defective artificial hips. Sales of orthopedics rose 2.8 percent in the quarter to $2.46 billion. Company shares were down  1.5 percent to $93.66 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid a 0.2 percent advance for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index .DRG of large U.S. and European drugmakers.

579,JNJ,"J&J;, Pharmacyclics drug wins U.S. approval for leukemia","(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Wednesday approved the Johnson & Johnson and Pharmacyclics Inc cancer drug Imbruvica to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a slowly progressing form of blood cancer. The Food and Drug Administration decision marks the second approval recently for the oral medicine, known chemically as ibrutinib. In November, the drug won U.S. approval to treat a rare and aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma called mantle cell lymphoma in patients who have received prior treatment with at least one other therapy. The latest approval is also for so-called second line therapy after at least one prior treatment fails or stops working, the FDA said. “Today’s approval provides an important new treatment option for CLL patients whose cancer has progressed despite having undergone previous therapy,” Richard Pazdur, head of the FDA’s Office of Hematology and Oncology Products, said in a statement. “The FDA completed its review of Imbruvica’s new indication under the agency’s accelerated approval process, which played a vital role in rapidly making this new therapy available to those who need it most,” Pazdur said. About 15,680 Americans were diagnosed with CLL and 4,580 died from the disease in 2013, according to the National Cancer Institute. There had been some disappointment in the market when the original approval of the drug did not include both types of cancer. The second approval provided a jolt for Pharmacyclics shares, which were up 6.7 percent at $141.75 on the Nasdaq on Wednesday afternoon. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee has been forecasting long-term annual worldwide sales of $5 billion for Imbruvica. According to long-term follow-up data from a midstage clinical trial presented at a major medical meeting in December, the drug maintained its effectiveness in keeping the disease at bay for most patients. With a median follow-up of more than 27 months of treatment, nearly all of the previously untreated patients and almost three-quarters of the relapsed patients in the study had no evidence of their CLL progressing. “Patients receiving ibrutinib are doing much better than historically what we’re used to seeing with CLL,” Dr John Byrd, a co-leader of that study, told Reuters at the time.

583,JNJ,UPDATE 2-U.S. FDA rejects wider use of Xarelto drug,"By Ransdell Pierson NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators have again declined to approve proposed wider uses of Bayer AG  and Johnson & Johnson’s lucrative blood clot preventer Xarelto, the drugmakers said on Friday. The companies had sought approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market the blockbuster pill for prevention of new heart attacks and strokes, and death, in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and also to prevent clogging of heart stents. ACS is an umbrella term covering any condition brought on by sudden reduced blood flow to the heart, including heart attack and chest pain. Xarelto’s biggest current approved use is to prevent blood clots and strokes in patients with an irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. The condition occurs mainly in the elderly. An advisory panel to the FDA concluded in January that Xarelto should not be approved to prevent new heart attacks or strokes, a use referred to as secondary prevention.  The medicine is co-marketed by J&J; and Bayer. Clinical data from a single J&J; trial was not strong enough to justify approval to market Xarelto to prevent further heart problems, especially since some data was missing, the panel found. J&J; originally filed for approval of Xarelto in ACS in late 2011. The FDA rejected the application, citing missing data. The company retrieved some missing data but the FDA once again declined to approve the drug, prompting J&J; to appeal the decision. After the FDA denied the appeal, J&J; filed a revised marketing application. But panelists in January said the additional data did not alter their view that the benefit of the drug was not shown to outweigh an increased risk of bleeding. Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman Kristina Chang on Friday declined to comment when asked if the FDA, in its rejection, had asked for new clinical trials to be conducted for the requested new uses or asked for other information. “We are not disclosing the details because we still are evaluating the contents and our next steps,” Chang said. Shares of J&J; were down 0.5 percent in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of Bayer rose 0.86 percent in Germany.

586,JNJ,EU Agency backs respiratory drugs for approval,"LONDON (Reuters) - European regulators recommended the approval of a clutch of drugs to treat respiratory diseases on Friday, including two from GlaxoSmithKline and another from Teva Pharmaceuticals. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said four of the drugs recommended for approval were intended to treat the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a condition that typically affects smokers, while another two were for asthma and COPD. Israeli drugmaker Teva received the nod for a combination of budesonide and formoterol, delivered by its Spiromax multi-dose dry powder inhaler, for the regular treatment of asthma and for the symptomatic treatment of patients with severe COPD. The fixed dose combination of the drugs, which have an anti-inflammatory effect in the lungs and which open the airways, was submitted under the names BiResp Spiromax and DuoResp Spiromax. A combination of umeclidinium bromide and vilanterol, developed by GSK and Theravance, was also recommended for approval under the brands Anoro and Laventair. GSK, a leader in respiratory medicine, also received the green light for umeclidinium as a monotherapy, which it will market as Incruse. The company released details of the judgments on Thursday. A dual-action drug from Novartis, which was authorized last year, also received the green light for a new marketing authorization under the Ulunar Breezhaler name, the EMA said, while Pfizer’s neuropathic pain, epilepsy and generalized anxiety disorder drug Pregabalin was also recommended on the same basis. In other therapy areas, Vokanamet, a treatment for type 2 diabetes from Johnson & Johnson, was given the nod.

Hologic, which makes screening tests for cancer and other diseases, also announced the planned retirement of Chief Financial Officer Glenn Muir, who has served in the position since 1992. Eric Compton, who will immediately assume the newly-created COO role, also worked with consumer giant Procter & Gamble Co , and has a record of successfully turning around flagging businesses, Hologic said in a statement. The company has been struggling with cuts in hospital spending, a lack of reimbursement for one of its mammography systems, and its troubled $3.75 billion acquisition and integration of Gen-Probe Inc. “We believe these senior management changes are positive steps toward turning Hologic around after numerous pricey acquisitions and in light of several secular headwinds to growth,” Cowen and Co analyst Doug Schenkel wrote in a note. With Friday’s appointments, Hologic’s entire top rank would have changed since December, when the company named former Stryker Corp CEO Stephen MacMillan as its top executive. MacMillan’s appointment came a month after billionaire investor Ichan took a stake in the company and pushed for representation on the board in an effort to boost shareholder value. Icahn, Hologic’s largest shareholder with a 12.5 percent stake, struck a deal with the company resulting in the appointment of two directors backed by Icahn. Icahn was not immediately available for comment on Friday. Hologic shares closed at $21.50 on Thursday on the Nasdaq.

592,JNJ,J&J; gets $1.2 billion Arkansas Risperdal judgment tossed out,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Thursday won a reversal by the Arkansas Supreme Court of a $1.2 billion judgment imposed after a jury concluded that the drugmaker improperly marketed its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal and concealed its risks. The penalty had been imposed in April 2012, one day after a jury in Little Rock, Arkansas, found that Johnson & Johnson and its Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit violated state laws governing Medicaid fraud and deceptive trade practices. Arkansas’ highest court, however, said the jury verdict and subsequent award could not stand because Arkansas had relied on the wrong law to sue Johnson & Johnson, using a law covering healthcare facilities rather than drug companies. “Janssen is indisputably not a healthcare facility and applying for certification or re-certification as described in the statute,” Associate Justice Karen Baker wrote for the court. “Hence, the statutory provision is not applicable.” The decision was unanimous, though three of the Supreme Court’s seven justices dissented from some of the reasoning. The Arkansas court also threw out an order directing Johnson & Johnson to cover the state’s $181 million in attorney’s fees. Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel in a statement said he still believes the state legislature meant the Medicaid fraud law to apply to companies such as Johnson & Johnson, which is based in New Brunswick, New Jersey. “I am disappointed that the court viewed the law differently,” he said. “Nevertheless, I will keep working to protect consumers against fraud and the kinds of irresponsible and greedy actions shown by Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals in their marketing of the drug Risperdal.” Pamela Van Houten, a Janssen spokeswoman, in a statement said the unit is pleased with the decision, and “remains strongly committed to ethical business practices.” The jury verdict came after a 12-day trial. In late afternoon trading, Johnson & Johnson shares were up 40 cents at $93.99 on the New York Stock Exchange. Risperdal was launched in 1994, and is used to treat conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability in people with autism. The drug and other anti-psychotic treatments have also been linked to side effects such as strokes, diabetes and weight gain. Generic versions are available. Following the jury verdict, Pulaski County Circuit Court Judge Tim Fox ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $1.19 billion for violating Arkansas’ Medicaid fraud law, or $5,000 for each of nearly 238,900 violations, plus $11.4 million for violating the deceptive trade law. Johnson & Johnson is awaiting a ruling by South Carolina’s Supreme Court on whether to overturn $327 million of penalties in a similar case. The Louisiana Supreme Court overturned a $258 million award in a similar case in January. In November, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay $2.2 billion to federal and state governments to settle criminal and civil allegations that it promoted Risperdal and other drugs for unapproved uses. It was accused in that case of promoting Risperdal for uses including the controlling of aggression and anxiety in older patients suffering from dementia, and treating behavioral disturbances in children and disabled people.

The Louisiana Supreme Court overturned a $258 million award in a similar case in January. In November, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay $2.2 billion to federal and state governments to settle criminal and civil allegations that it promoted Risperdal and other drugs for unapproved uses. It was accused in that case of promoting Risperdal for uses including the controlling of aggression and anxiety in older patients suffering from dementia, and treating behavioral disturbances in children and disabled people.

594,JNJ,J&J; wins reversal of $1.2 bln Risperdal judgment in Arkansas,"March 20 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Thursday won the reversal by the Arkansas Supreme Court of a roughly $1.2 billion judgment in a lawsuit accusing the company of improperly marketing the anti-psychotic drug Risperdal. The court said the jury verdict could not be supported because Arkansas, which had brought the case, had sued under a law covering health care facilities, rather than drug companies such as Johnson & Johnson and its Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit. Risperdal was launched in 1994, and is used to treat conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability in autistic people. The drug and other anti-psychotic treatments have also been linked to side effects such as strokes, diabetes and weight gain. Generic versions are available.

599,JNJ,"UPDATE 2-EU backs J&J; hepatitis C pill plus new drugs from Lilly, Takeda","(Adds detail on competitors in hepatitis C market) LONDON, March 21 (Reuters) - European regulators have recommended approval of a new pill for hepatitis C from Johnson & Johnson, underscoring the rapid development of oral treatment options for the liver-destroying disease. The green light from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for J&J;’s Olysio, also known as simeprevir, follows U.S. approval for the treatment in November. The drug, which was developed in collaboration with Sweden’s Medivir, is one of several that is vying for a share of a major new market in treatments for hepatitis C. The new wave of pills cut the need for debilitating interferon injections. Gilead’s hepatitis C pill Sovaldi is already on sale in the United States and has been recommended for approval in Europe, while other companies including AbbVie are also working on promising oral treatments. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also said on Friday it had backed new drugs from Eli Lilly, Takeda and Endocyte. Eli Lilly and its partner Boehringer Ingelheim received a recommendation for their diabetes medicine Jardiance, or empagliflozin, which failed to win U.S. approval earlier this month because of manufacturing issues. Japan’s Takeda, meanwhile, secured a recommendation for Entyvio, or vedolizumab, as a treatment of ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. The EMA also gave its backing to Vynfinit, or vintafolide, together with companion diagnostics, from Endocyte and Merck & Co, for ovarian cancer patients, plus another J&J; drug for multicentric Castleman’s disease, a rare blood condition. Recommendations for marketing approval by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months.

602,JNJ,Experimental J&J; psoriasis drug shows promise in study,"March 22 (Reuters) - An experimental Johnson & Johnson  drug for moderate to severe psoriasis proved significantly better at clearing the scaly, uncomfortable skin patches associated with the disease than a placebo, according to data from a midstage study presented on Saturday. The J&J; biologic medicine, guselkumab, achieved the main goal of the Phase II study at all five dosing regimens tested by clearing or reducing the psoriasis to a minimal measure after 16 weeks of treatment in a far greater percentage of patients than in the group that received a placebo. It also appeared to be as good as or more effective than AbbVie’s big selling Humira at four of the tested doses. “The efficacy of guselkumab in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis looks promising according to these Phase IIb study results,” Dr. Kristina Callis Duffin, one of the study’s investigators, said in a statement. Results were determined using Physician Global Assessment (PGA) scores - a zero to 5 scale in which 0 indicates the disease has been cleared, 1 represents minimal disease and 5 indicates the most severe symptoms. Guselkumab led to scores of 0 or 1 in as high as 86 percent of patients who received 100 milligrams of the drug every eight weeks, and in 83 percent of patients who were injected with 200 mg of the J&J; medicine at the start of the trial and at week 4 and then every 12 weeks. At the lower end, 34 percent of patients who got 5 mg of the drug to start and at week 4 and then every 12 weeks achieved PGA scores of 0 or 1. That was still deemed to be statistically significant compared with 7 percent for those who got a placebo. In the Humira (adalimumab) group, 58 percent had scores of 0 or 1 after 16 weeks of treatment. Results of the 293-patient trial, dubbed X-Plore, were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) meeting in Denver. J&J; has not yet said which of the treatment regimens would be advanced to larger, pivotal Phase III trials. Guselkumab, which would be a follow-up treatment to J&J;’s Stelara, works by blocking interleukin-23, or IL-23, a protein that has been associated with chronic inflammation and is believed to play a role in psoriasis. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said the drug “is really under the radar right now.” He currently sees sales reaching about $500 million several years after approval, but said estimates could change if later Phase III data were impressive. In addition to the primary goal, significantly higher proportions of guselkumab patients achieved at least a 75 percent improvement in psoriasis as measured by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI 75) at week 16. Those results ranged from 44 percent of patients taking the lowest dose up to 81 percent at higher dosing regimens. That compared with 5 percent for placebo and 70 percent for Humira. A 90 percent improvement was seen in as high as 62 percent of patients who got 100 mg of guselkumab every eight weeks. The results remained consistent or showed additional improvement after 40 weeks of treatment, the company said. After a year of treatment, serious adverse side effects were reported in 3 percent of those treated with guselkumab and 5 percent for Humira. There were no cases of tuberculosis or opportunistic infections. One guselkumab patient reported a malignancy and there were three major adverse heart events, including one fatal heart attack, in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors, the company said. Psoriasis, an immune-system related disease that causes an overproduction of skin cells resulting in patches of thick inflamed skin covered with silvery scales, affects 125 million people worldwide and about 7.5 million Americans, according to the National Psoriasis Foundation.

603,JNJ,Fitch Affirms Johnson & Johnson at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ)  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and long-term debt at 'AAA'. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this press  release. Key Rating Drivers: --The rating action reflects Fitch's expectation that JNJ will continue to  generate strong operational and financial performance, supported by all three of  its business segments. --The company's agreement to sell its Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business for  $4.15 billion makes strategic sense and preserves its broad-based business  model. --Favorable mix trends and ongoing efforts at cost control should provide  support to gross and operating margins, despite some operational headwinds. --Fitch forecasts free cash flow (FCF) generation of $7.4 billion - $7.7 billion  in 2014, driven by 4%-6% sales growth and relatively stable margins. --Fitch anticipates that JNJ will continue to invest in long-term growth and  operate with leverage and liquidity consistent with its 'AAA' rating. Durable Growth: JNJ's recently launched pharmaceutical businesses and an expanding pipeline in  its pharmaceutical and medical device businesses support the prospects for  continued low single-digit growth. In addition, strong demand for many of the  company's products in developing markets should more than offset dampened  performance of a few of JNJ's U.S. consumer and medical device franchises. Other Operational Headwinds to Persist: The expectation for continued weak economic and employment environment will  moderate growth to varying degrees in most of the company's franchises. In  addition, austerity measures in Europe will likely weigh on the company's  revenues and margins in that region. Fitch expects these issues will persist at  least through 2014. Sensible Strategic Pruning: In January 2014, the company received a binding offer from The Carlyle Group to  acquire the Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business for $4.15 billion. Fitch  believes the margins and long-term growth opportunities for this business had  been lower versus those for the total firm. While the sale will incrementally  improve JNJ's total profitability, it should only modestly reduce the  diversification of its portfolio, given that the diagnostics business accounts  for roughly only 2.7% of total firm sales. Margin Support: Fitch expects JNJ's improving sales mix and continued focus on costs will  support margins. The company's recently approved pharmaceutical products line  and continued expansion of its medical device segment will support faster growth  for these segments relative to JNJ's lower-margin consumer business. In  addition, Fitch expects that JNJ's management will continue to focus on  generating greater operational efficiencies in administration, manufacturing and  distribution. Solid Liquidity: JNJ has significant liquidity and access to the credit markets. Moderate growth  and relatively stable margins enabled the company to generate $6.5 billion of  FCF [cash flow from operations ($17.4 billion minus capital expenditures ($3  billion) and dividends ($7.3 billion)] during the LTM period ended Dec. 29,  2013. On Dec. 29, 2013, JNJ had approximately $29.2 billion in cash plus  short-term marketable securities and access to $10 billion in short-term  borrowings.  Debt Structure   JNJ had approximately $18.2 billion in debt, with approximately $4.8 billion  maturing in 2014, $2.1 billion in 2016, $1 billion in 2017 and $1.5 billion in  2018. Debt increased by about $2 billion during the LTM period, as the company  took advantage of a continuing favorable long-term interest rate environment.  Resulting TD/EBITDA remained essentially flat at 0.77x, primarily because of the  growth in EBITDA. JNJ's current capital structure is supportive of its 'AAA'  rating given a number of measures, including the following three credit metrics  that Fitch uses as criteria for a an issuer such as JNJ as of Dec. 29, 2013.  Rating Sensitivities: While Fitch does not anticipate a downgrade during its four-year forecast  horizon, a negative rating action could occur if some combination of  deteriorating operational performance and leveraging transactions stress the  company's credit profile. Fitch believes the company's broadly diversified  health-care related franchises make it more likely that a negative rating action  would be prompted by a leveraging transaction, as opposed to operational stress. Key rating metrics include the following:  --Total debt/FCF of 3.0 times (x) gives no flexibility; --Total debt/EBITDA of 1.0x gives no flexibility; --Net debt of $4 billion - $5 billion gives no flexibility. On Dec. 29, 2013, latest 12 month (LTM) selected credit metrics were as follows: --Total debt/FCF was nearly 2.8x. --Total debt/EBITDA was 0.77x. --JNJ had a net cash position of $11 billion. Fitch has affirmed JNJ's ratings as follows: --IDR at 'AAA'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'AAA';    --Subordinated debt at 'AAA'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --Commercial paper at 'F1+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to approximately $18.2 billion of debt. Contact: Primary Analyst Bob Kirby Director  +1-312-368-3147  Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

606,JNJ,J&J; says halting development of Botox rival,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Friday it was ending its efforts to bring to market a rival drug to Allergan Inc’s popular Botox anti-wrinkle treatment.

Ending the PurTox development program will result in the elimination of a small number of jobs in the United States, the company said. Botox is Allergan’s biggest selling product with annual sales of more than $2 billion and little serious competition. The drug is primarily used cosmetically via injections to erase wrinkles on the forehead. It has also been approved for several medical uses such as to treat overactive bladder, migraine headaches, upper limb spasticity and severe underarm sweating.

608,JNJ,Wall Street ends higher as blue chips rally; Intel up late,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended a volatile session higher on Tuesday, lifted by gains in such blue-chip names as Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson, though persistent weakness in momentum names limited the Nasdaq’s advance. Coke and J&J;, both Dow components, climbed after their results while recent outperformers fell, a sign that investors were rotating from growth stocks into value ones. In recent weeks, high-growth stocks have been under pressure after a meteoric rise in their prices took valuations to levels that appeared unsustainable. The three major U.S. stock indexes fell for much of the session before rebounding in afternoon trading. The Nasdaq moved in a 108.77-point range, and at its lows of the day, it was within 0.3 percent of 3,934.53, the level that represents a 10 percent drop from its recent intraday peak, hit on March 6. “The market is trying to stabilize, and investors are looking for high-quality names that have stability in their earnings and prices,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio. “This afternoon’s move is part of that same flight to quality.” Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) jumped 3.7 percent to $40.18 as one of the S&P; 500’s biggest gainers after the world’s largest beverage maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by strong sales in China. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) rose 2.1 percent to $99.20 after the pharmaceuticals and consumer products company posted earnings that beat expectations and raised its full-year profit view. Among the most active “momentum” names, shares of electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) fell 2.1 percent to $193.91 and shares of online movie rental company Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) dropped 1.6 percent to $326.27. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG.O) shares fell 1.9 percent to $417.09. “We’re going through a period of rolling corrections, which will consolidate the high-growth names that did so great last year,” said Hayes Miller, head of asset allocation in North America at Baring Asset Management in Boston. “I don’t read anything systemic into the action, as seen by the gains in more defensive areas. The losses should remain contained.” After the closing bell, Intel Corp (INTC.O) shares rose 3 percent to $27.56 in extended-hours trading after the chipmaker reported its first-quarter results and gave an outlook. Yahoo Inc YHOO.O shares rose 1.4 percent to $34.70 after the bell following the company’s results. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 89.32 points, or 0.55 percent, to end at 16,262.56. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX gained 12.37 points, or 0.68 percent, to finish at 1,842.98. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC added 11.47 points, or 0.29 percent, to close at 4,034.16. In the latest economic snapshot, a gauge of manufacturing in New York state grew at a much slower rate in April than it did in March, coming in far below expectations. The U.S. Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent in March as food and housing rental costs rose, although inflation pressures remained generally benign. S&P; 500 companies’ first-quarter earnings are projected to have increased just 1 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent. Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) shares surged 11.4 percent to close at $45.52 after the company said it bought social data provider Gnip for an undisclosed amount. Aaron’s Inc (AAN.N) shares tumbled 4 percent to end at $29.25 after the rent-to-own furniture and electronics retailer said it had rejected a $2.3 billion takeover offer from a major shareholder and instead acquired a retail credit financing firm for about $700 million. Barcode printer maker Zebra Technologies (ZBRA.O) said it would buy Motorola Solutions Inc’s (MSI.N) enterprise business, which makes rugged mobile computers, tablets and barcode scanners, for $3.45 billion in cash.

The Nasdaq slid more than 1 percent, weighed down by another downturn in momentum names. In recent weeks, momentum names - stocks seen by investors as having high growth potential - have been under pressure after a meteoric rise in their prices took valuations to levels that appeared to be unsustainable. Tesla Motors Inc fell 5.5 percent to $187.25 and NetFlix Inc dropped 4.5 percent to $316.82 to rank among the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100 index. The Global X Social Media index, whose components include Facebook, LinkedIn and Yelp,  fell 2.7 percent. The exchange-traded fund, designed to measure the performance of companies in the social media industry, has dropped nearly 22 percent since the end of February. The Nasdaq Biotech index dropped 2.8 percent. The index, whose components include Alexion Pharmaceuticals and Biogen Idex, has lost more than 20 percent over the past six weeks. Those losses put both indexes in bear market territory, which Wall Street defines as a drop of 20 percent from a peak. “They reached a level where the pricing was absurd in terms of the valuation of these companies, and for whatever reason, the market has woken up to the fact and is now correcting to get them back down to a reasonable valuation,” said Stephen Massocca, managing director of Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. “And suddenly everyone realizes the emperor has no clothes.” Coca-Cola Co shot up 3.3 percent to $40.01 and gave the biggest boost to the S&P; 500 after the U.S. soft drink maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue. Strong sales in China more than offset a drop in Europe and flat volumes in North America, Coca-Cola said. Fellow Dow component Johnson & Johnson rose 1.1 percent to $98.24 after the company posted quarterly earnings well above Wall Street’s expectations. Brisk sales of new prescription drugs balanced weak sales of consumer products, according to J&J;, which slightly raised its full-year profit view. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 63.90 points or 0.40 percent, to 16,109.34. The S&P; 500 lost 9.89 points or 0.54 percent, to 1,820.72. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 63.648 points or 1.58 percent, to 3,959.046. Economic data continued to point to a sluggish recovery. A gauge of manufacturing in New York state grew at a much slower rate in April than it did in March, coming in far below expectations. The U.S. Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent in March, although inflation pressures remained generally benign. The National Association of Home Builders said homebuilder sentiment edged up in April but remained mostly dour on lingering concerns about stiff credit conditions for buyers and tight supply of building lots and labor. S&P; 500 companies’ first-quarter earnings are projected to have increased just 1 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent.

612,JNJ,J&J; beats forecasts as sales of new drugs shine,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) reported quarterly earnings well above expectations, as strong sales of new drugs offset weak demand for consumer products and medical devices, and the company slightly raised its full-year profit view. J&J; on Tuesday said it earned $4.73 billion, or $1.64 per share, in the first quarter. That compared with $3.5 billion, or $1.22 per share, in the year-ago quarter, when the diversified healthcare company took a big litigation charge. “Strong pharmaceuticals results showcased a very strong 2014 start for J&J;,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, referring to sales growth of almost 11 percent for prescription medicines in the quarter. He cited particularly strong sales of immunology medicines and for the company’s recently approved Olysio treatment for hepatitis C. The hepatitis drug, a protease inhibitor, was approved by U.S. regulators in November and captured global sales of $354 million in the first quarter. Olyzio is being paired with Gilead Sciences Inc’s (GILD.O) new and widely used hepatitis C treatment, Sovaldi. But the J&J; brand can expect competition over the next year from other hepatitis C drugs, including a second treatment from Gilead that will be combined with Sovaldi in a single pill. J&J; handily beat earnings forecasts because newer drugs have very high profit margins, Conover said. “They amplified the affect on the company’s bottom line.” But J&J;’s other business units failed to impress. Sales of medical devices and diagnostics were flat at $7.06 billion, hurt by lower prices associated with competitive bidding in the U.S. Medicare insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Company executives, in a conference call with analysts, said device and diagnostics sales were also hurt by a decline in hospital admissions and laboratory procedures during the quarter. Global sales of consumer products fell 3.2 percent to $3.56 billion, as many over-the-counter medicines remain unavailable due to earlier product recalls in the United States. J&J; says it now expects full-year earnings of $5.80 to $5.90 per share, up from its prior forecast of $5.75 to $5.85 per share given in January. Excluding $300 million in gains from special items, including a tax benefit, J&J; earned $1.54 per share. Analysts, on average, were expecting $1.48 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The earnings beat was clean, driven by higher gross margins” and slightly lower spending for sales, general and administrative expenses, said Glenn Novarro, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. Company sales rose 3.5 percent to $18.1 billion in the quarter, topping Wall Street forecasts of $18 billion. They would have risen 5.3 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in markets outside the United States. Global sales of prescription drugs jumped to $7.5 billion, about $350 million above Wall Street expectations. Sales of Simponi, for rheumatoid arthritis, rose 9.3 percent to $259 million, while sales of psoriasis treatment Stelara soared 32 percent to $456 million.

The loan package, as reported, is split between a $350 million, five-year revolving credit facility and a $2.175 billion, seven-year term loan. Price guidance on the covenant-lite term loan is set at LIB+350 with a 1 percent Libor floor. The loan is offered to investors at an original issue discount of 99-99.5. It has 101 soft call protection for six months. The term loan will amortize at 1 percent annually. Lead left Barclays is arranging the credit facility, with Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, UBS and Nomura joining on the right. The loan launched Monday at a bank meeting. Commitments are due May 7. J&J; is selling the clinical diagnostics business to Carlyle for $4.15 billion. In addition to the leveraged loan portion, the financing package is expected to include $1.15 billion in senior unsecured notes. Senior leverage on the deal is 3.2 times and total leverage is 5.1 times, sources said. Moody’s Investors Service on April 25 assigned first-time ratings to Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics SA. Moody’s assigned a B2 corporate family rating and a B1 facility rating to the new credit facilities. Additionally, the rating agency assigned a Caa1 rating to the proposed $1.15 billion senior unsecured notes offering. OCD SA, a Luxembourg entity, is the parent company of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Inc, a U.S. entity.

Raritan, NJ-based OCD serves clinical laboratories and the transfusion medicine community. The company provides tools for early screening, diagnosing, monitoring and confirming diseases, focused on supporting hospitals, laboratories and blood centers globally. The company generated approximately $1.9 billion of revenues for the year ending December 29, 2013, according to Moody’s. The transaction is expected to close mid-2014.

620,JNJ,J&J; suspends sale of device used in fibroid surgery,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson suspended worldwide sale of its device used in fibroid surgery amid concerns over its potential to spread undetected cancer beyond the uterus. The company said it is suspending the sale of its power morcellators until their role in fibroid treatment is better understood and redefined by the medical community. The action follows a Food and Drug Administration advisory on April 17 that discouraged doctors from using laparoscopic power morcellators to remove fibroids because of a risk of worsening an often-hidden cancer. (r.reuters.com/dug68v) “Ethicon morcellation devices have always included cautions in their instructions for use about the potential spread of malignant tissue,” J&J; wrote in a letter to customers, a copy of which is available with Reuters. J&J; said the step was not a product removal as the FDA maintained that power morcellation may still be the best option for some patients after risk evaluation and informed consent. The FDA was not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours. “We are also reaching out to regulatory agencies around the globe as this is a global notification,” J&J; spokeswoman Sheri Woodruff told Reuters. Laparoscopic power morcellation is one of several available treatments for fibroids. It is a procedure that uses a medical device to divide the uterine tissue into smaller pieces or fragments so it can be removed through a small incision in the abdomen. Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous growths that originate from the smooth muscle tissue in the wall of the uterus.

Energizer said it expects the separation to help the businesses intensify focus on commercial priorities and better allocate resources. “We’re surprised by the decision to split the company, but think it makes sense,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Connie Maneaty said. “The personal care segment may realize a higher valuation if it is not bound to the battery business.” The households products business’s contribution to Energizer’s revenue declined from 70 percent in 2006 to 45 percent last year. Battery sales have declined amid increasing competition and growing demand for rechargeable batteries used in mobile devices. Household product sales fell 15.8 percent to $373.4 million, mainly due to the loss of two U.S. retail customers and higher promotional spending, in the second quarter ended March 31. Larger rival Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), home to Duracell batteries and Gillette razors, is also trying to streamline its businesses. The company said earlier this month that it would sell its pet food business to Mars Inc for $2.9 billion. The loss of two big U.S. retail customers, whom Energizer didn’t name, will hurt sales by 6 percent each in the first three quarters of 2014, the company said. Energizer shut manufacturing facilities, cut input expense and fired staff under a cost-saving program last year. The company said on Wednesday the cost-cutting will continue through the separation process. Energizer expects the personal care business, which also makes Wilkinson Sword shavers and Banana Boat sunscreen, to be a consumer product company aimed at growing through scale and innovation. The business reported revenue of about $2.6 billion in the year to March 31 and current Chief Executive Ward Klein is slated to be the executive chairman of the business. The sum-of-the-parts multiple of Energizer’s businesses is about 9.5 times — 15 percent higher than its current enterprise value multiple of 8.3 times forward EBITDA, Bernstein research analyst Ali Dibadj said. “This split may provide further operational benefits and increases the chance of mergers and acquisitions,” he added. The planned tax-free spin-off is expected to be completed in the second half of the year ending September 2015. The company expects the household products business, which brought in $1.9 billion in revenue in the year ended March 31, to generate strong margins and cash flows. Alan Hoskins, the chief executive of Energizer Household Products, will continue to lead the business post-split. Energizer also reported that its second-quarter net income rose 16 percent to $98.5 million, or $1.57 per share. Excluding items, it earned $1.88 per share. Sales fell 3.1 percent to $1.06 billion. Personal care sales rose 5.6 percent to $689 million, benefiting from its acquisition of the feminine care business from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in July. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.71 per share on revenue of $1.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters Energizer shares were up 16 percent at $113.37 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The stock has risen 2.2 percent in the year to Tuesday's close, lagging the wider S&P; 500 Index .SPX which has risen 17.87 percent in the same period.

628,JNJ,"J&J; sees device growth via new products, emerging markets","(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said on Thursday it would file for approvals of more than 30 major products by the end of 2016 as it looks to restore growth to a medical device division that has been overshadowed by its drugs business. The diversified healthcare company said it was positioned for growth through new products and would place significant focus on fast-growing emerging markets, particularly China and Russia. “We are capitalizing on our established footprint to grow and expand our overall business (in China),” Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said during a device business review for analysts and investors at its New Jersey headquarters. J&J; said it signed an exclusive agreement with Nova Biomedical Corp to sell blood glucose testing systems to hospitals in China, which account for about 60 percent of diabetes care in the country. The company also said there is a large need for minimally invasive surgical products for lung cancer surgeries in China that it believes it can address. Michel Orsinger, head of global orthopedics, said 40 percent of projected future growth from his division will come from emerging markets. In Russia, building the vision care business will be a priority, the company said. J&J; is hoping to jumpstart growth in the device and diagnostics business that saw flat first-quarter sales of $7.06 billion. Its pharmaceuticals division by comparison grew nearly 11 percent in the first quarter. Gary Pruden, head of global surgical products, forecast compound annual growth of 4 percent to 6 percent from 2013-2018 for his division. He projected between 21 and 25 new product launches over the next 18 months to two years in areas such as catheter ablation, biosurgery products and other surgical devices. The company is awaiting approval for automated manufacture of its Evarrest patch to stop surgical bleeding that should help spur growth of that biosurgical product. He said business was stabilizing in Europe. “Countries in Europe are starting to pay their bills, which is a good thing.” Ashley McEvoy, head of diabetes and vision care, said J&J; expects to launch in 2015 a new contact lens for presbyopia, in which aging eyes have trouble focusing on close objects, and a new insulin delivery patch in the next two years. J&J; said its DePuy Synthes orthopedics unit was launching new products, including a shoulder repair system and a hip replacement system designed to preserve bone. In recent years the unit had been plagued by major recalls and law suits involving some of its older hip replacements. Orsinger said the orthopedics unit was going to centralize some operations from its eight companies in part to help sales representatives combine multiple product offerings in a single customer visit. The medical device segment posted 2013 sales of $28.5 billion - about 40 percent of the company’s total business.

They also ordered retailers to jointly launch promotions in major Chinese cities all year around to keep prices stable, the notice said. Dealers and retailers who do not comply with the order will be subject to unspecified financial penalties, it said. Other penalties may include seeing a halt to their supplies from the overseas manufacturers. Johnson & Johnson executives could not be reached immediately for comment.

635,JNJ,"Pharmacyclics, J&J; drug shown to improve leukemia survival","CHICAGO (Reuters) - A new drug for the most common form of leukemia in adults  improves survival for patients whose disease has worsened despite standard treatment, according to late-stage study findings released on Saturday. Ibrutinib, sold by Pharmacyclics Inc and Johnson & Johnson under the brand name Imbruvica, was approved by U.S. regulators for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in February. The therapy “beat the pants off” of ofatumumab, or Arzerra, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline Plc, in the Phase 3 trial, said Dr. John Byrd, the study’s lead investigator and a professor of medicine at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center in Columbus, Ohio. JP Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said the trial results, along with the fact that the drug is a pill that does not need to be combined with another therapy, could help propel sales. Pharmacyclics said earlier this month that it expected Imbruvica revenue of $295 million this year, which disappointed some investors. The trial involved 391 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia that had progressed after two or more prior therapies. Standard treatment for such patients is a combination of chemotherapy and an antibody drug, such as Arzerra. The results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting on Saturday in Chicago. At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, the study found that ibrutinib lowered the risk of death by 57 percent compared with ofatumumab. Researchers said they expect the trial to result in median overall survival in the range of several years. At median follow-up, 86 percent of patients on ibrutinib had responded to the drug and were continuing treatment with minimal side effects, compared with response rates between 35 percent and 40 percent for standard therapies, Dr. Byrd said. Side effects associated with ibrutinib included diarrhea, minor bleeding and heart arrhythmias.   “These results provide a compelling new treatment option for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, including older adults with this disease, and will significantly change (physicians’) practice,” Dr. Olatoyosi Odenike, a leukemia expert at the University of Chicago said in an ASCO statement. Odenike was not involved in the study. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February approved Imbruvica as a secondary treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It was previously approved for mantle cell lymphoma patients who have tried other therapies.  Studies are also under way to test the drug as an initial treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Imbruvica is an oral drug designed to target an enzyme known as Bruton’s tyrosine kinase and block the function of certain cancerous cells. Drugs in a similar class are under development by companies including AbbVie and Gilead Sciences Inc. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a slowly progressing form of blood cancer, is diagnosed in about 16,000 Americans and will kill around 4,600 every year, according to the American Cancer Society.

638,JNJ,J&J; links up with GSK-led group on new two-drug HIV tablet,"LONDON, June 12 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson has linked up with ViiV Healthcare - a specialist HIV company majority-owned by GlaxoSmithKline - to develop a new AIDS medicine combining two drugs in a single tablet. The decision to study and commercialise a tablet containing J&J;’s non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor Edurant, or rilpivirine, and ViiV’s integrase inhibitor Tivicay, or dolutegravir, promises a simpler alternative to current three-drug therapies. The idea is to use the two-drug combination tablet once a patient’s level of virus has been suppressed and stabilised. Studies included in the new development programme are expected to begin by the first quarter of 2015 and will investigate the new combination as an HIV maintenance therapy for patients already virally suppressed on a three-drug regimen. The deal expands ViiV’s portfolio of regimens based on Tivicay, which is viewed by analysts as an important future revenue driver for GSK. Pfizer and Shionogi hold minority stakes in ViiV.

641,JNJ,US STOCKS-Wall St dips after Yellen comments on valuations,"* JPMorgan, Goldman up after earnings * Johnson & Johnson falls after results * New York manufacturing hits highest level since April 2010 * Indexes off: Dow 0.03 pct, S&P; 0.21 pct, Nasdaq 0.59 pct   (Updates to market open, adds Yellen comments, quote) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower on Tuesday, pulling back from modest gains on weakness in small-cap and momentum names after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen expressed concerns about their valuations. In the monetary policy report accompanying her Congressional testimony, Yellen said, “equity valuations of smaller firms as well as social media and biotechnology firms appear to be stretched.” The Russell 2000 small-cap index lost 1.1 percent and the Global X Social Media ETF dropped 1.9 percent. Facebook shares lost 2 percent to $66.55. “She signaled in her comments about extreme valuations in biotech and social media. And that seems to be an addendum to her text,” said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co in Lake Oswego, Oregon. “It’s very unusual for the Fed chairman to take a micro view of a specific industry group. Usually the comments are very top level. So I think the Fed is a little more in tune with what has been bothering the market. My thought is it’s late, but not too late in terms of recognition.” According to the BofA Merrill Lynch Fund Manager Survey for July, 61 percent of global asset managers are overweight equities, the highest reading since early 2011, but 21 percent see stock markets as overvalued, the highest reading since 2000. Wall St had posted modest gains in the early portion of trading on the back of earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase , up 4.2 percent to $58.64, and Goldman Sachs, up 0.6 percent to $168.09. But fellow Dow component Johnson & Johnson lost 1.2 percent to $104.17. The diversified healthcare reported higher-than-expected quarterly results on sizzling sales of its new Olysio treatment for hepatitis C, but cautioned the pill will lose steam later this year. S&P; 500 profits are seen growing 5.2 percent in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from the 8.4 percent growth forecast at the start of April. Revenue is seen up 3.2 percent. S&P; 500 companies reporting earnings after the close include Yahoo Inc and Intel Corp. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.27 points or 0.03 percent, to 17,051.15, the S&P; 500 lost 4.1 points or 0.21 percent, to 1,973 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 26.13 points or 0.59 percent, to 4,414.29. In a flurry of economic data releases, the New York Fed’s Empire State index OF general business conditions rose to 25.60, the highest level since April 2010, from 19.28 in June and above the 17 estimate. Retail sales rose 0.2 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.5 percent advance in May, shy of the estimate calling for a 0.6 percent rise. However, core sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, rose 0.6 percent for the month. In addition, import prices edged up 0.1 percent in June, shy of the 0.3 percent estimate, after increasing by a revised 0.3 percent in May.

642,JNJ,"J&J; beats forecasts, helped by new hepatitis C drug","(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) reported higher-than-expected quarterly results on sizzling sales of its new Olysio treatment for hepatitis C, but company officials cautioned the pill will lose steam later this year as newer rivals come to market. Global company sales jumped 9.1 percent in the second quarter to $19.5 billion, beating Wall Street expectations of $18.99 billion.   But while overall pharmaceutical sales soared, helped also by treatments for blood clots and prostate cancer, the company’s medical devices and consumer products posted weak sales gains. Olysio, which U.S. regulators approved in November, chalked up sales of $831 million for the second quarter and $1.19 billion for the year to date.     Many doctors use the pill with Gilead Sciences Inc’s (GILD.O) Sovaldi, which was approved in December to treat the hepatitis C liver virus and has achieved even higher sales than Olysio.     But industry analysts believe Olysio’s strong sales growth will level off later this year if Gilead wins approval for a pill that combines Sovaldi with another of the company’s treatments.     Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said Olysio drove J&J;’s profit beat, but cautioned, “(L)ittle credit will be awarded long term as new competing therapies enter the market” later this year and compete with the new J&J; pill.     Joaquin Duato, head of J&J; pharmaceuticals, in a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, said Olysio’s “(sales) run rate is unlikely to continue in 2015.”  J&J; only slightly boosted its full-year earnings forecast despite its outsized second quarter results, to between $5.85 and $5.92 per share - from its earlier outlook of $5.80 to $5.90. Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy said she believed the new 2014 profit forecast is conservative, but that “the lack of a more meaningful guidance raise” would weigh on shares on Tuesday. The diversified healthcare company said it had earned $4.33 billion, or $1.51 per share, in the second quarter. That compared with $3.83 billion, or $1.33 per share, a year earlier.  The company took charges for litigation and acquisitions in both periods.  Excluding special items, J&J; earned $1.66 per share in the latest quarter. Analysts on average were expecting $1.55, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Global company pharmaceutical sales surged 21 percent in the quarter to $8.5 billion, with U.S. sales surging almost 37 percent - fueled by demand for Olysio, blood clot preventer Xarelto and prostate cancer treatment Zytiga.  Sales of the company’s wide array of medical devices and diagnostics languished, by comparison, edging up 0.7 percent to $7.2 billion. Company Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said the segment’s weak performance was largely due to a disappointing number of surgical procedures and hospital admissions, a longstanding trend related to the weak global economy.  Consumer products, including over-the-counter medicines such as painkiller Tylenol, also put on modest performance, with sales rising 2.4 percent to $3.7 billion.

The approvals reflect a rapid pace of progress in treating CLL, a slowly progressing form of blood cancer, as scientists develop better ways to target the biological pathways involved in the disease. Last November, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also approved Roche’s Gazyva and the use of Arzerra, from GlaxoSmithKline and Genmab, was expanded in April 2014 to include CLL.

647,JNJ,J&J; seeks return of device seen as possibly raising cancer risk,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Wednesday it plans to ask doctors to return its power morcellators, a controversial surgical device that may inadvertently spread cancer in women being treated for uterine growths called fibroids.

649,JNJ,COLUMN-Healthcare: A remedy for long-term investors,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By John Wasik CHICAGO, Aug 4 (Reuters) - For healthcare, gray is the new black. The fastest-growing segment of the global population is aged 60 and over, according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. That slice of humanity is expected to increase by 45 percent by 2050. The surge in the older population has contributed to a wave of new product introductions in biotechnology, medical devices and pharmaceuticals, and expansion of healthcare services. In addition, healthcare is a remarkably durable sector for investors, soldiering on despite periodic market downturns, like the one seen last week when the S&P; 500 index had its worst week since 2012. Overall, there’s a bounty of money being spent on healthcare that’s unlikely to be impacted by other economic trends. One of the best ways to own the biggest players in the healthcare industry is through the Vanguard Health Care ETF , which holds global giants like Johnson & Johnson , Pfizer Inc. and Merck and Co.. Charging 0.14 percent in annual management expenses, the Vanguard fund, which is almost entirely invested in U.S.-based stocks, gained 20 percent for the 12 months through Aug. 1, compared with 15 percent for the S&P; 500 Total Return Index. Long-term, the Vanguard fund has been a solid performer, averaging 10.5 percent annually for the decade through Aug. 1. That compares with an average 7 percent return for the MSCI World NR stock index. For more non-U.S. exposure, consider the iShares Global Healthcare ETF, which charges 0.48 percent for annual expenses. The iShares fund has about 60 percent of its portfolio in North American stocks, with the remainder in European and Asian-based companies such as Novartis AG, Roche Holding AG and GlaxoSmithKline PLC. The fund gained 19 percent over the 12 months through Aug. 1. For a more focused play on leading-edge biotech and genomic companies, the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech Index ETF  samples some of the hottest companies in that sub-sector. Holdings include industry leaders Gilead Sciences Inc., Biogen Idec Inc. and InterMune Inc.. The First Trust fund was up nearly 25 percent for the 12 months through Aug. 1; it charges 0.60 percent in annual expenses. Since most institutional portfolio managers have seen the merits of healthcare stocks for years, there are probably few bargains available, although some sectors are pricier than others. Biotech stocks, in particular, are in high demand, although they experienced a sell-off earlier this year. “On the other hand,” Fidelity Investments analyst Eddie Yoon said in a recent report, “some large-cap, stable growth companies across the (healthcare) sector continue to appear attractive, based on their stable underlying business fundamentals.” Unlike other sectors such as consumer discretionary that are directly tied to overall economic conditions, healthcare is often insulated from broader economic trends. When the S&P; 500 index dropped 37 percent in 2008, the Vanguard fund only lost 23 percent; the First Trust fund was off 18 percent. While biotech stocks tend to be volatile, the mainstream healthcare companies are seen as defensive holdings and more immune to broader market pressures and poised for bankable growth. Long term, the more volatile biotech stocks of today may be tomorrow’s winners. The growing science of genomics will allow biotech companies to customize drugs to a patient’s genetic make-up. Just three years ago it cost $95 million to sequence a human genetic code. Now it costs about $4,000, with the price dropping every year. That will translate into more precise treatments with fewer side effects. There are several concurrent waves of innovation in health information technology, diagnostics and delivery of services. More patients can be monitored and treated at home with the improvement in information technology. Diseases are being discovered and treated earlier, which means fewer hospitalizations. In the United States alone, healthcare spending is buoyed by the $3 trillion spent annually on Medicare patients. While policymakers say this number is unsustainable and must be reined in, that does not change a key fact: Some 10,000 Baby Boomers are turning 65 every day. They will continue to demand the best drugs and treatments.

655,JNJ,J&J; Ebola vaccine to start clinical trials in early 2015,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Scientists will fast-track tests on another Ebola vaccine, this time from Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, in another sign that the world’s worst outbreak of the virus is mobilizing research into the deadly disease. J&J; said on Thursday that clinical trials of its new vaccine, which includes technology from Danish biotech firm Bavarian Nordic BAVA.CO, would commence in early 2015. The move follows a decision to begin initial human testing of a GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L vaccine this month and plans to test one developed by Canadian government scientists, which has been licensed to NewLink Genetics NLNK.O, in the autumn.  Human tests on the J&J; vaccine were previously not expected to start until late 2015 or early 2016. J&J;’s long-term goal is to develop a vaccine that can protect against both the Zaire and Sudan strains of Ebola, as well as a related condition called Marburg disease. But the program has been simplified in light of the current outbreak. “Because of the emergency we decided to focus on the Ebola Zaire strain, which is the one in the West Africa outbreak, and that’s why we can accelerate the program significantly,” Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels told Reuters. As with the GSK and NewLink programs, J&J; is working on the clinical trials with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of National Institutes of Health. “The crisis is so important here, and still expanding, that more than one approach is warranted, in case the epidemic doesn’t come under control in the coming months,” Stoffels said. All of the initial Phase I trials will enroll healthy volunteers with the goal of determining whether the experimental vaccines are safe and whether they provoke a protective immune response. Stoffels said it had not yet been decided where trials on the J&J; vaccine would be conducted or how many subjects would be involved. The race to develop new drugs and vaccines has been spurred by a World Health Organization ruling that it is ethical to use experimental products in the current epidemic, given the high death toll.  Governments and aid organizations have scrambled to contain the disease, which according to the United Nations agency has killed more than 1,900 in West Africa since March. J&J; said its vaccine, which was developed by its Crucell unit in the Netherlands, provided complete protection against the Zaire strain of Ebola when tested on macaque monkeys. Like a number of other experimental vaccines against various diseases that are now in development, it uses a common cold virus, called an adenovirus, to carry its payload. Immunization with the J&J; vaccine consists of two injections one to prime the immune system and a second to boost the response. They were given two months apart in the monkey tests. By contrast, researchers are testing just a single shot of GSK’s vaccine. How safe and effective J&J;’s product will be in humans remains to be seen, but more than 1,000 people have already received similar experimental vaccines from Crucell in clinical trials for other diseases with no apparent ill effects, offering some reassurance. Bavarian Nordic, meanwhile, has used a similar approach in producing a smallpox vaccine that has been stockpiled around the world and tested on more than 7,300 people. J&J; is also stepping up research into potential drugs for Ebola by undertaking an intensive review of known biological pathways used by the virus to see if previously tested medicines might help.",9042014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-johnson-johnson/jj-ebola-vaccine-to-start-clinical-trials-in-early-2015-idUSKBN0GZ0AA20140904

It was the second case to go to trial among thousands that have been consolidated in West Virginia federal court, after the first ended in February with a win for Ethicon. The company had previously been hit with an $11 million verdict in a mesh trial in New Jersey state court last year, and a $1.2 million verdict following a trial in Texas state court in April.  The plaintiff, Jo Huskey, was 52 when she was implanted with a Gynecare TVT Obturator, or TVT-O, transvaginal mesh device in 2011 to treat stress urinary incontinence, according to her lawyer, Fidelma Fitzpatrick of Motley Rice. Huskey and her husband sued the next year, claiming problems with the device led to serious side effects including pelvic pain.  Fitzpatrick said the Huskeys were thrilled with the verdict. “I think it sends a very clear message to Ethicon that these products and these cases are extremely serious,” she said. “These women are very seriously injured from these products.” A spokesman for Ethicon, Matthew Johnson, said the company was disappointed with the verdict and intends to appeal. “Ethicon’s TVT-O midurethral sling was properly designed, and Ethicon acted appropriately and responsibly in the research, development and marketing of the product,” he said in a statement.  While the Huskey verdict is not binding on thousands of other Ethicon mesh cases, it will help both sides assess the strengths and weaknesses of the litigation as a whole as they decide whether to press forward with more trials or consider a settlement.  Ethicon is among seven companies facing a wave of litigation over mesh devices. Other defendants include C.R. Bard  Inc and Boston Scientific Corp. Boston Scientific recently won the first two mesh cases to go to trial against it in Massachusetts state court. Last year, C.R. Bard was hit with a $2 million verdict in the first mesh trial in West Virginia federal court.  In April, Endo International’s American Medical Systems [ENDPAM.UL] subsidiary became the first major manufacturer to largely bow out of mesh litigation, agreeing to pay $830 million to resolve thousands of these cases.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said earlier this year that it was considering proposals to tighten safety standards for transvaginal mesh devices used to treat pelvic organ prolapse. If finalized, the proposals would require manufacturers to submit data proving the devices’ safety and effectiveness before allowing them to be sold.  The case is Huskey v. Ethicon, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, No. 12-5201.

659,JNJ,"Coke, J&J; join big companies behind new employee wellness push","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of some of the biggest U.S. corporations, from Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), unveiled a campaign on Tuesday to reduce the nation’s healthcare costs, urging their peers to embrace wellness programs to improve employee health. The newly-formed group, called The CEO Council on Health and Innovation, said it came together “to lead the U.S. business community” in improving employee and community health and reducing costs. The council’s members also include Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), Aetna Inc (AET.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Walgreen Co WAG.N, McKinsey & Co, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and the Institute for Advanced Health. Combined, the group said its healthcare benefits cover 150 million people. In a report released at a press conference in Washington, D.C. in conjunction with the Bipartisan Policy Center, the council called on employers to accelerate the adoption of wellness programs to improve nutrition and weight management, promote physical activity, help employees quit smoking and manage chronic diseases.     Several council members described successful wellness initiatives at their own firms and urged others to follow suit. “Today is about a call to action,” said Coca-Cola Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent. The company’s sugary soft drinks have been the target of public health advocates who argue they contribute to obesity and related diseases such as diabetes. Workplace wellness programs, a $6 billion-a-year industry, are popular because they promise to improve productivity, cut absenteeism and reduce medical costs by averting expensive illnesses.  Some employers, including Bank of America, offer financial incentives for employees to get screened, while others have begun to penalize workers who don’t participate in wellness requirements. Despite the rising popularity of such programs, some independent research has shown that wellness campaigns do not always cut costs as hoped.  A long-running workplace wellness program at PepsiCo PEP.N, for example, helped reduce costs for workers with chronic diseases by cutting down hospital admissions. But the savings for employees who were urged to make preventive changes to their lifestyle were negligible, according to a report published in the journal Health Affairs in January. Still, Dr. Fikry Isaac, vice president of global health services at J&J;, said the company’s own research showed that every dollar it spent on wellness programs yielded a potential $2 to $4 return on investment. “We believe it does work and we have the ability to show quite a bit of evidence,” he said. One J&J; study that lasted more than six years showed a $565 dollar saving per employee per year, Isaac said, adding that healthcare costs for J&J; over the period rose just 1 percent, compared to a gain of 4.7 percent for its peers.

662,JNJ,Lawyer grills DePuy executive over safety studies for Pinnacle hips,"(Reuters) - An executive at Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy Orthopaedics Inc unit on Monday defended the company’s assessment of safety risks associated with metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants in a Dallas court from a lawyer who said the company had neglected to perform critical safety testing. Pamela Plouhar, the worldwide vice president of clinical research at DePuy, was grilled by a lawyer for plaintiff Kathy Herlihy-Paoli during the first trial among more than 6,000 lawsuits over the Pinnacle hips that have been consolidated in Dallas federal court. The outcome of this so-called bellwether case could have an impact on DePuy’s decision to continue fighting the cases in court or consider a settlement.  Herlihy-Paoli and other plaintiffs claim the company failed to understand and warn patients and doctors about the device’s risks, instead marketing them as safe.  On Monday, Herlihy-Paoli’s lawyer, Mark Lanier, pressed Plouhar over what studies DePuy had performed on the implants, in an attempt to show jurors that the company had been negligent in gathering clinical data on the devices before they were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2000.  Plouhar said there was “no human study that looked at” the health effects of metal debris for the Pinnacle hips before 2001. Lanier said that research as early as 1974 suggested problems with the metal-on-metal devices. During testimony last week, Lanier pointed to documents that showed that Thomas Schmalzried, a Los Angeles surgeon who had consulted with DePuy on the hips, said in 2001 that more information was needed to assess the risks of metal debris in Pinnacle devices. On Monday, Plouhar insisted DePuy had followed industry standards. When asked by Lanier whether the company had done the “necessary studies” on the metal-ion issue to prove the hips were safe, she said they had.  The safety record of metal-on-metal implants and whether DePuy properly vetted the devices have been key themes so far during the trial, which entered its third week on Monday.  Herlihy-Paoli’s lawyers have said the failure rates for the implant were unacceptably high - more than 14 percent over seven years. Herlihy-Paoli, a 58-year-old woman from Montana, received two Pinnacle hips in 2009, and said in her 2012 lawsuit that defects in the devices led the level of cobalt in her blood to skyrocket to 85 times the normal level.  While the Pinnacle implant has not been recalled, the company stopped selling metal liners for the devices last year.  In a statement, DePuy spokeswoman Mindy Tinsley said the company undertook a comprehensive review of scientific and clinical information on metal-on-metal hips before launching the Pinnacle metal-on-metal device, including two FDA-approved clinical trials, and continued to monitor the device’s safety after its launch.  Last year, DePuy agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hip systems, which were recalled in 2010.

665,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson to buy private drug developer for $1.75 billion,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) agreed to pay $1.75 billion in cash to buy privately held Alios BioPharma Inc, which is developing a drug for a common respiratory viral infection in children for which there is no approved treatment. J&J; said Alios would also give it access to a portfolio of drugs targeting other viral infections. J&J; has been increasing its focus on treatments for infectious diseases, having signed two other deals earlier this year – one for the maintenance treatment of people with HIV and the second to treat influenza. Alios’s experimental drug, AL-8176, to treat infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is currently in mid-stage trails. In July, the company reported positive results from a similar study in adults. “We have great expectations for this drug to help children who suffer with RSV,” William Hait, research chief for J&J;’s Janssen unit, said in a telephone interview. In the United States, RSV is the most common cause of an inflammation of the airways in the lung and pneumonia in infants under the age of 1, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Every year on average, RSV leads to 1.5 million outpatient visits among children younger than 5 years old, according to the CDC.  J&J; is developing its own treatment for RSV and said Alios’ AL-8176 would complement its own portfolio. The J&J; drug has not yet been tested in humans, Hait said. While RSV has no approved treatment, AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) sells the only approved vaccine to prevent RSV in children. The vaccine, Synagis, generated U.S. sales of $47 million in the three months ended June 30. The deal to buy Alios has been approved by the board of both companies and is expected to close in the fourth quarter, the companies said. J&J; shares were up 5 cents at $106.61 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Goldman, Sachs & Co acted as financial adviser to Alios and Latham & Watkins LLP was its legal adviser.

668,JNJ,"J&J; beats forecasts, helped by hepatitis drug","(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson reported strong quarterly earnings on surging sales of a new treatment for hepatitis C, but the company said it had sharply reduced prices for its artificial hips and warned that profits could be hurt next year by the stronger dollar.  Sales of the J&J; (JNJ.N) drug, called Olysio and approved in November, reached $796 million in the third quarter. As with other hepatitis C drugs that began with rapid ascents, however, its commercial success is expected to be short-lived.  Morningstar analyst Damien Conover predicted 2015 sales of Olysio will plunge more than 50 percent due to the approval on Friday of a new pill called Harvoni from Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) that can rid patients of the liver-destroying viral infection within as little as 8 weeks. Conover said strong quarterly sales of other relatively new J&J; drugs, including its Zytiga treatment for prostate cancer and blood clot preventer Xarelto, bode well for J&J; and the drug industry over the long term. “The core drugs are doing well, with a lot of strength from newer brands, and that signifies a healthy environment for pharmaceutical stocks,” Conover said. J&J;’s global drug sales jumped 18 percent to $8.3 billion, a slowdown from 21 percent growth in the second quarter. But sales of J&J;’s medical devices fell 5.2 percent to $6.6 billion, after the recent divestiture of the company’s Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics unit and a 5 percent price cut for its artificial hips. J&J; Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso told analysts on a conference call that J&J; cut prices of the hip implants as it attempted to renew contracts with hospitals and other customers. On another cautionary note, Caruso said the strengthening dollar could hurt 2015 earnings by 15 to 20 cents per share. Sales of company consumer products, including Tylenol, slipped 0.6 percent to $3.6 billion in the quarter. The company earned $4.75 billion, or $1.66 per share. That compared with $2.98 billion, or $1.04 per share, in the year-earlier period, when J&J; took special charges for legal expenses and merger-related costs.   Excluding special items, J&J; earned $1.50 per share. Analysts on average had expected $1.45 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Company sales rose 5.1 percent to $18.47 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of $18.38 billion.  J&J; said it now expects 2014 earnings, excluding special items, of $5.92 to $5.97 per share. In July, it forecast $5.85 to $5.92 per share.

673,JNJ,Jury deliberations begin in first trial over DePuy's Pinnacle hips,"(Reuters) - A lawyer for a Montana woman on Tuesday urged jurors in a U.S. court to find Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy Orthopedics unit liable for failing to warn patients that metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defective at the close of the first trial over the device. During the seven-week trial in Dallas, lawyers for Kathleen Herlihy-Paoli accused the company of concealing the safety risks of the metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants she received in 2009. They said the company failed to warn doctors and patients that the device could shed metal ions into the bloodstream, infecting surrounding tissue and causing the level of metals such as cobalt in the blood to soar.  DePuy has vigorously fought back against Herlihy-Paoli’s claims and said the device did not fail and the plaintiff’s lawyers never identified a specific flaw that caused her injuries.    The jury began deliberating Tuesday evening and will continue Wednesday. The case is before U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in the Northern District of Texas.  The outcome of Herlihy-Paoli’s case will weigh on more than 6,000 other cases over Pinnacle hip implants that have been consolidated in the same Dallas federal court, and could impact Johnson & Johnson’s willingness to settle the lawsuits or continue to try cases in hopes of beating plaintiffs’ claims.  In his closing argument Tuesday, a lawyer for Herlihy-Paoli, Mark Lanier, said DePuy aggressively pushed the metal-on-metal devices for younger patients with active lifestyles, saying they could last longer than versions made with other materials such as ceramic or polyethylene, a type of plastic. But in doing so, Lanier said, the company ignored years’ worth of data suggesting that metal-on-metal hips failed at an abnormally high rate, putting thousands of patients at risk.  “Send a clear message that holds them accountable,” Lanier told jurors. He asked them to award at least $1.4 million for Herlihy-Paoli’s medical costs and an additional, unspecified amount in punitive damages.  Throughout the trial, DePuy has maintained that the devices are safe when properly used, and that plaintiffs’ lawyers unfairly tried to target Pinnacle for problems linked to different metal-on-metal hip implants, including DePuy’s ASR implant, which was recalled in 2010. Last year, DePuy agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hips.  Richard Sarver, a lawyer for DePuy, said Herlihy-Paoli’s two Pinnacle hips may have been improperly positioned, and that her active lifestyle may have exacerbated any problems.  “If you place a cup in the wrong position, which is what happened here, bad things happen,” Sarver said.   A spokeswoman for DePuy, Mindy Tinsley, said the company is committed to “vigorously defending itself against the claims” made in Pinnacle lawsuits.  The case is Herlihy-Paoli v.

675,JNJ,RPT-Tens of thousands expected to get Ebola vaccines from January - WHO,"(Repeats to additional clients.) * Clinical trials now under way to yield data on dosage * Health workers should get GSK, NewLink vaccines in Jan * Johnson & Johnson, Russia also have candidate vaccines By Stephanie Nebehay GENEVA, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people in West Africa are expected to begin getting experimental Ebola vaccines from January, but population-wide immunisation is still far off, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday. Initial clinical trials of vaccines from GlaxoSmithKline  and NewLink Genetics are already under way. Some 500 volunteers are due to take part in countries including the United States, Britain, Germany, Switzerland, Mali, Gabon and Kenya. The tests will generate safety and immune-response data in December. The vaccines can then be rolled out early next year to groups including frontline healthcare workers, said Marie-Paule Kieny, the WHO assistant director-general for health systems and innovation. “These data are absolutely crucial to allow decision-making on what dose level should go into efficacy testing in Africa,” Kieny told a news briefing. Determining the dosage will dictate the yield or overall amount of vaccine available for the large clinical trials in Africa, she said. “There is still a possibility that it will fail, but everybody is putting things in order in order for being able to move to West Africa in January,” Kieny said. “When I say deployed, I am not talking about mass vaccination, I am talking about utilisation in the tens of thousands of doses in the first couple of months of the year.” West Africa’s Ebola outbreak, which began in March, has killed 4,546 out of 9,191 known cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to WHO, which has declared outbreaks in Senegal and Nigeria over. There have been a handful of Ebola cases in Spain and the United States, which on Monday issued stringent new protocols for health workers treating Ebola victims. FUNDING THE ROLL-OUT Vaccine makers and regulatory authorities are moving quickly to speed up trials and approval for the vaccines, Kieny said. Donors stand ready to help finance the roll-out, expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, she added. “The funding scenario has not been worked out. But what we are working on for the time being is the assumption that the funding will come from the countries who are helping with the response, so indeed the U.S., UK, France, Norway, Germany and many others as well as from the GAVI,” she said. The Geneva-based GAVI alliance procures vaccines at affordable prices for use in developing countries. While the GSK and the NewLink vaccines, the latter developed by Canada’s Public Health Agency and licensed to the U.S. firm, are considered “lead candidates”, others are being developed. Johnson & Johnson has a candidate vaccine that is expected to start clinical trials in January, Kieny said. Inovio Pharmaceuticals is developing a DNA vaccine that would enter clinical tests early next year. Protein Sciences is developing a vaccine that should reach trials in the first quarter of 2015, she said. Both are U.S.-based companies. Russia has been developing Ebola vaccines, but their status is less clear, Kieny said. “The best that I know is that one of the vaccines is either currently or has already been in clinical trials, in Phase I clinical trials, to assess safety and immunogenicity in Russia,” she said. “We are currently discussing with them to know a bit more about what are the results and what are their plans.” Experimental drugs against Ebola include Fujifilm’s  flu drug Avigan, or favipiravir, the safety and efficacy of which the French government will evaluate in a clinical trial in Guinea, she said. The trials are expected to start in coming weeks, she said. Asked whether this would be the first drug used in trials in Ebola-affected West African countries, Kieny said: “If it starts on time, as far as I am aware, yes.” British scientists said on Tuesday that Avigan might also have potential against norovirus, or the winter vomiting bug. {ID:nL6N0SG324] The U.S.-made drug ZMapp from Mapp Biopharmaceutical has been given to a handful of  infected health workers evacuated from the region, but this has been on an ad hoc basis, she said.

681,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson's DePuy wins first trial over Pinnacle hips,"NEW YORK/DALLAS (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson was found not liable by a Texas jury on Thursday in the first case to go to trial over whether Pinnacle hip implants made by the company’s DePuy Orthopedics unit were defective. The test case had high stakes for the pharmaceutical giant, which is hoping to avoid a replay of a $2.5 billion settlement it agreed to last year for a different metal-on-metal hip device. The Dallas federal jury ruled unanimously against the plaintiff Kathleen Herlihy-Paoli, who said the two metal-on-metal Pinnacle hips she received in 2009 were faulty and that the company failed to warn patients and doctors about the device’s risks. DePuy had said the implants were improperly positioned, and not to blame for her injuries. Jurors needed about two days to deliberate, after a seven-week trial.  Plaintiffs’ lawyers selected Herlihy-Paoli’s lawsuit to be among the first to go to trial out of more than 6,600 lawsuits over the Pinnacle hips. The unanimous win for DePuy is expected to affect its approach to the rest of the lawsuits, which are consolidated before U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade. DePuy spokeswoman Mindy Tinsley said the company was pleased with the verdict and was committed to the “long-term and vigorous defense” of the litigation.  The metal-on-metal device “was appropriately developed, thoroughly tested and responsibly marketed,” she said in a statement.  A lawyer for Herlihy-Paoli, Mark Lanier, called the case “the first skirmish in what is likely to be a long war.” “We still plan to press on with fierce dedication to clients we believe have been tragically wronged,” he said.  Herlihy-Paoli said she required multiple surgeries to fix and replace her implants after the surrounding tissue became infected and the level of the metal cobalt in her blood soared to 85 times the normal level.  Her 2012 lawsuit said the device’s metal components rubbed together, shedding metal ions.  At trial, lawyers for Herlihy-Paoli accused DePuy of aggressively marketing the devices to more active people, while concealing abnormally high failure rates. DePuy’s lawyers countered that the devices were safe when used and implanted properly. They also said Herlihy-Paoli unfairly targeted DePuy for problems linked to different metal-on-metal hips, such as the company’s ASR devices.  Last year, DePuy agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over the ASR devices, which it recalled in 2010.  DePuy stopped selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013.  Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor, called the verdict surprising and said jurors may have responded to DePuy’s argument that the hips may have been improperly positioned.  “They can take some comfort in this verdict,” he said, referring to DePuy. “But I’m sure there will be more.” The case is Herlihy-Paoli v.

Herlihy-Paoli said she required multiple surgeries to fix and replace her implants after the surrounding tissue became infected and the level of the metal cobalt in her blood soared to 85 times the normal level. Her 2012 lawsuit said the device’s metal components rubbed together, shedding metal ions. At trial, lawyers for Herlihy-Paoli accused DePuy of aggressively marketing the devices to more active people, while concealing abnormally high failure rates. DePuy’s lawyers countered that the devices were safe when used and implanted properly. They also said Herlihy-Paoli unfairly targeted DePuy for problems linked to different metal-on-metal hips, such as the company’s ASR devices. Last year, DePuy agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over the ASR devices, which it recalled in 2010. DePuy stopped selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013. Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond law professor, called the verdict surprising and said jurors may have responded to DePuy’s argument that the hips may have been improperly positioned. “They can take some comfort in this verdict,” he said, referring to DePuy. “But I’m sure there will be more.” The case is Herlihy-Paoli v. Pinnacle, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, No. 12-4975.

683,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson's DePuy wins first trial over Pinnacle hips,"NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson was found not liable by a Texas jury on Thursday in the first case to go to trial over whether Pinnacle hip implants made by the company’s DePuy Orthopaedics unit were defective. The Dallas federal jury ruled unanimously against the plaintiff Kathleen Herlihy-Paoli, who said the two metal-on-metal Pinnacle hips she received were faulty. DePuy had said the implants had been improperly positioned, and were not to blame for her injuries.  Jurors needed about two days to deliberate, following a seven-week trial. The trial served as the first test case for more than 6,600 similar lawsuits.

Amgen is developing brodalumab under a multi-drug collaboration with AstraZeneca that involves splitting costs and eventual profits. After 12 weeks of treatment of 1,881 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, 36.7 percent who received the 210 milligram dose of brodalumab and 27 percent treated with 140 mg of the Amgen drug achieved total clearance of the skin disease. That compared with 18.5 percent of those treated with Stelara and 0.3 percent in the placebo group. On a secondary measure, 85.1 percent in the higher-dose brodalumab group and 69.2 percent who got the lower dose achieved at least a 75 percent improvement in disease severity at week 12 versus 69.3 for J&J;’s Stelara and 6 percent of the placebo group. “These results are of particular importance as they are the first to demonstrate superiority to Stelara in achieving total skin clearance, and the second positive pivotal Phase III study evaluating brodalumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis,” Amgen research and development chief Sean Harper said in a statement. The most common adverse side effects seen with brodalumab were common cold symptoms, joint pain, upper respiratory tract infection and headache. There were more adverse side effects deemed to be serious with the Amgen antibody than with Stelara. Serious adverse events were reported in 1.4 percent for the higher dose of brodalumab and 1.6 percent in the 140 mg group, compared with just 0.6 percent for Stelara and 1 percent in the placebo group.

688,JNJ,Geron sells last drug in pipeline to J&J; unit,"(Reuters) - Geron Corp licensed its cancer compound, the last in its pipeline, to a unit of Johnson & Johnson for up to $935 million, sending its shares up as much as 33 percent in extended trading. The license deal comes as a welcome break to the company, which has seen its stock price drop from a high of $71.69 in 2000 to $2.31 on Thursday. The drug developer will receive $35 million in upfront payment and the rest in milestone payments.  Under the deal, J&J;’s unit Janssen Biotech Inc, will be responsible for the development, regulatory approval and sales of the cancer compound, imetelstat, worldwide. Geron will receive royalties on net sales. If successful, imetelstat would compete with Incyte Corp’s myelofibrosis drug, Jakafi, which generated sales of $235.4 million last year. Some analysts have indicated that imetelstat’s ability to evoke a disease-modifying effect - defined as partial or complete remission - suggests it would be superior to Jakafi. Geron did not disclose plans for its pipeline. The company could not be reached immediately for additional comments. The deal includes a clause for Janssen to terminate the agreement at any time due to a safety-related concern, according to a filing.

A stronger dollar and decline in gasoline prices affected a trio of economic reports on Friday as overall retail sales rose more than expected while U.S. import prices fell in September by the most in more than two years. In addition, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment for this month came in at 89.4, the highest since July 2007, buoyed by falling unemployment and gas prices. “It’s a consolidating day and everyone is focused on oil, what is oil telling us here?” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. “Is it going down because of a price war, or is it going down because of the prospects of the global economy slowing even further?” Brent crude was up 2.5 percent at $79.40 a barrel, bouncing from a four-year low, while U.S. crude advanced 1.4 percent to $75.22.

The oilfield services company said it was in preliminary merger talks with larger rival Halliburton Co, which was little changed at $53.75. Virgin America Inc, a low-cost airline partly owned by Richard Branson, soared as much as 28 percent in its market debut, underscoring the buoyant mood in an industry that is seeing relief from lower oil prices.

696,JNJ,RPT-J&J; seeks over $5 bln in damages from Boston Scientific at trial,"(Repeats without changes to headline or text) By Joseph Ax NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Nearly a decade after losing a bidding war for device maker Guidant to Boston Scientific Corp , Johnson & Johnson finally has a chance for payback at a multibillion-dollar trial set to begin on Thursday. A federal court judge in New York will hear the case without a jury and decide whether Guidant, through its successor Boston Scientific, should be held liable for breaching a contract with J&J.; J&J; seeks in excess of $5 billion in damages and interest from Boston Scientific, a potentially massive judgment against a company that as of Tuesday had a market capitalization of $17.8 billion. The two-part trial before U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan is expected to go into December as lawyers revisit the details, and the aftermath, of the nine-year-old Guidant battle. Underscoring the stakes, Boston Scientific has brought in well-known litigator David Boies. Johnson & Johnson will answer with a high-profile lawyer of its own, Sean Coffey, perhaps best known for winning a $6 billion judgment against big banks in the wake of WorldCom’s collapse. The companies declined to comment ahead of the trial. Jefferies Group analyst Raj Denhoy said in a note that the case “represents a major near-term risk” for Boston Scientific. J&J; and Guidant, which made cardiovascular devices, struck a deal to combine in 2004 and later agreed to a $21.5 billion price. To satisfy antitrust concerns, J&J; said it would sell a portion of Guidant’s business to Abbott Laboratories. The deal included a “no-solicitation” clause that prohibited Guidant from seeking better offers, though it was permitted to consider unsolicited bids. Before the merger closed, Boston Scientific made a $25 billion offer and also said it would sell assets to Abbott. J&J; became convinced that Guidant had provided due diligence to Abbott as it worked on the Boston Scientific offer, in violation of its agreement. Without that move, J&J; says, Abbott would not have signed on, leaving Boston Scientific unable to win what became a bidding war. Boston Scientific eventually bought Guidant for $27 billion, while J&J; received a $705 million termination fee. J&J; sued Guidant and Abbott in 2006, claiming breach of contract. Abbott has since been dismissed as a defendant. Boston Scientific plans to argue that Guidant did not knowingly violate the agreement, according to court papers. It has also questioned whether J&J; can prove it lost money. J&J;’s stock has soared since, while Boston Scientific’s has fallen, in part over problems with the Guidant deal. In pretrial filings, Boston Scientific cited a Fortune magazine article that called it the “biggest M&A; blunder since AOL/Time Warner.” J&J; will counter that its deal would have succeeded, given its superior resources. It will also point to documents that it says show Guidant knew at the time that its actions were in breach of the agreement.

699,JNJ,J&J; seeks over $5 bln in damages from Boston Scientific at trial,"NEW YORK, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Nearly a decade after losing a bidding war for device maker Guidant to Boston Scientific Corp , Johnson & Johnson finally has a chance for payback at a multibillion-dollar trial set to begin on Thursday. A federal court judge in New York will hear the case without a jury and decide whether Guidant, through its successor Boston Scientific, should be held liable for breaching a contract with J&J.; J&J; seeks in excess of $5 billion in damages and interest from Boston Scientific, a potentially massive judgment against a company that as of Tuesday had a market capitalization of $17.8 billion. The two-part trial before U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan is expected to go into December as lawyers revisit the details, and the aftermath, of the nine-year-old Guidant battle. Underscoring the stakes, Boston Scientific has brought in well-known litigator David Boies. Johnson & Johnson will answer with a high-profile lawyer of its own, Sean Coffey, perhaps best known for winning a $6 billion judgment against big banks in the wake of WorldCom’s collapse. The companies declined to comment ahead of the trial. Jefferies Group analyst Raj Denhoy said in a note that the case “represents a major near-term risk” for Boston Scientific. J&J; and Guidant, which made cardiovascular devices, struck a deal to combine in 2004 and later agreed to a $21.5 billion price. To satisfy antitrust concerns, J&J; said it would sell a portion of Guidant’s business to Abbott Laboratories. The deal included a “no-solicitation” clause that prohibited Guidant from seeking better offers, though it was permitted to consider unsolicited bids. Before the merger closed, Boston Scientific made a $25 billion offer and also said it would sell assets to Abbott. J&J; became convinced that Guidant had provided due diligence to Abbott as it worked on the Boston Scientific offer, in violation of its agreement. Without that move, J&J; says, Abbott would not have signed on, leaving Boston Scientific unable to win what became a bidding war. Boston Scientific eventually bought Guidant for $27 billion, while J&J; received a $705 million termination fee. J&J; sued Guidant and Abbott in 2006, claiming breach of contract.

701,JNJ,Exclusive: J&J; hires Goldman to explore sale of Splenda - sources,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has hired Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to explore a sale of its artificial sweetener brand Splenda, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  Such a move would let Johnson & Johnson, maker of prescription drugs, medical devices and baby shampoo, exit a business beset by weakened soft drink sales and intense competition.     The process is at an early stage, with prospective buyers signing non-disclosure agreements, one of the sources said on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the matter is private.  Johnson & Johnson (J&J;) and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.   The business, which has annual revenue of around $300 million, could attract interest from private equity buyers because it generates strong cash flows and good margins, according to the sources.  “But there is no obvious strategic buyer (from the food or ingredients sectors) because high-intensity sweeteners are not that attractive at the moment,” according to one of the sources.   Splenda, an artificial sweetener made from sucralose, was jointly developed by J&J; subsidiary McNeil Nutritionals and British ingredients firm Tate & Lyle (TATE.L), which continues to supply the sucralose. Tate, which also declined to comment, in September forecast sucralose prices would be down about 25 percent this year, saying it had to renegotiate supply contracts at lower prices to protect market share from cheaper Chinese rivals.  At the same time, sucralose sales have been pressured by declining demand for carbonated soft drinks in markets such as the United States, due to changing consumer tastes and greater health consciousness.  “I’d imagine those kinds of businesses wouldn’t attract a huge (price) multiple in today’s environment,” said Declan Morrissey, an analyst at Davy Research, which follows Tate & Lyle but not J&J.; “You can use carbonated soft drink volumes as a proxy for sucralose volumes and they’ve been falling by low single-digits for the last 12 to 24 months. So you’ve got a top-line volume component that’s struggling and then pricing that’s off 20 to 30 percent.”  One potential bright spot for the sweetener market is in natural sweeteners such as stevia, derived from a South American shrub. Coca-Cola (KO.N) and PepsiCo PEP.N have recently launched stevia-sweetened versions of their flagship colas.   Merisant, maker of rival sweetener products Equal and Canderel, was in October sold to licorice ingredients maker Flavors Holding for an undisclosed sum.

702,JNJ,U.S. appeals court tosses $176 mln award for Covidien in patent case,"(Reuters) - The top U.S. patent appeals court has thrown out a $176 million award for healthcare company Covidien Plc  in a dispute with a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary over surgical instruments. Judge Sharon Prost of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., ruled on Thursday that Covidien’s patent claims, which involve surgical cutting tools that use ultrasonic technology, were invalid. Dublin-based Covidien in 2010 sued Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc, a subsidiary of New Jersey’s Johnson & Johnson, claiming it sold surgical tools that violated several patents issued in the 1990s. Last year a U.S. district judge awarded Covidien $176 million after a non-jury trial, and Ethicon appealed. Prost said in Thursday’s decision that the inventions described by Covidien’s patent claims, which include using a curved blade instead of a straight one, were obvious in light of earlier technology. Covidien said in a written statement that it was disappointed in the ruling and was considering its options. Ethicon was not immediately available for comment.

713,JNJ,"J&J;, Bavarian Nordic start clinical tests in Ebola vaccine race","LONDON (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson has started clinical trials of its experimental Ebola vaccine, which uses a booster from Denmark’s Bavarian Nordic, making it the third such shot to enter human testing. The initiation of the Phase I study in Britain, which had been expected about now, marks further progress in the race to develop a vaccine against a disease that has killed more than 8,000 people in West Africa since last year.  Two other experimental vaccines, one from GlaxoSmithKline and a rival from NewLink and Merck, are already in clinical development. However, the J&J; vaccine offers a different approach, since it involves two separate injections. U.S.-based J&J; said on Tuesday it had produced enough vaccine to treat more than 400,000 people, which could be used in large-scale clinical trials by April, and a total of 2 million courses would be available in 2015. Previously, J&J; expected more than 1 million courses this year. It also now predicts it can make enough vaccine for 5 million treatments, if required, over a 12- to 18-month period. Just how much Ebola vaccine will be needed depends on how quickly the epidemic in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea is brought under control and declines. Currently, experts project demand at anywhere between 100,000 and 12 million doses. “As long as there are still Ebola patients, there is the risk that it will continue to go around the region,” Paul Stoffels, J&J;’s chief scientific officer, told reporters.  “Does it come too late? That’s going to be answered when we are there. I don’t think so.” ‘PRIME-BOOST’ The first volunteers have received initial injections in Oxford, where 72 healthy subjects will get different regimens involving various combinations of the vaccine components or a placebo.  Additional clinical studies are planned in the United States later this month and soon after in Africa, where volunteers will receive the vaccine in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Phase I trials are designed primarily to test safety but may also indicate whether vaccines produce a good immune response.  In all, some 300 subjects will be involved in Phase I testing, after which J&J; hopes to move rapidly into larger studies, with final-stage Phase III trials planned for the second quarter of 2015.  The J&J; and Bavarian vaccine uses a so-called “prime-boost” approach of giving a first shot to stimulate the immune system, followed by a second booster a few weeks later.  The GSK and NewLink vaccines have been tested initially as single shots, although there is growing debate as to whether two-stage vaccination might be a more strategic option, since it is likely to provide better protection. The downside is that it would make mass immunisation more complicated.  “What we are doing with prime-boost is going for maximal protection, as well as long-term protection,” Stoffels said. Importantly, tests have shown the J&J; vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge for several months, rather than needing special freezing, which is difficult in rural Africa. Shares in Bavarian Nordic, which received investment from J&J; last year to accelerate production, rose 3.9 percent to their highest level in four years.

718,JNJ,J&J; strikes Alzheimer's research deal with Swiss firm AC Immune,"LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson boosted its research efforts into battling Alzheimer’s on Monday, striking a deal potentially worth more than $500 million to develop anti-tau vaccines with Swiss biotech firm AC Immune. Tau is a protein known for forming twisted fibers inside brain cells and is linked to cell death. It is one of two abnormal proteins tied to the memory-robbing disease. The other is beta amyloid. The hope is that therapeutic vaccines targeting tau will offer a way to treat Alzheimer’s patients early in the disease. It is a decade since the last drug was approved for Alzheimer’s, and there is still no treatment that can slow its progression, with current drugs only easing some of its symptoms. Unlisted AC Immune said on Monday it would receive an upfront sum and further payments based on scientific and commercial progress under the worldwide exclusive license agreement and research collaboration with J&J;’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit. J&J; will further develop AC Immune’s lead therapeutic vaccine, ACI-35, which is currently in an early-stage Phase Ib clinical trial. ACI-35 is designed to stimulate the patient’s immune system to produce a response against tau protein. The deal is the fourth licensing agreement for AC Immune, which has another major tie-up with Roche for a beta amyloid-fighting drug called crenezumab. Roche is due to make a decision about whether to advance crenezumab into late-stage testing, which will be crucial factor in determining how AC Immune’s future pans out.     “We will leave our options open and see what the best steps for the company are. An IPO is one of the options,” AC Immune’s Chief Executive Andrea Pfeifer told Reuters in an interview. AC Immune has a further vaccine, ACI-24, for preventing and clearing amyloid plaques in Phase I/IIa clinical trials. Pfeifer said the company plans to start testing that vaccine in people with Down syndrome in the course of this year. Up to 75 percent of adults with the condition develop dementia.

723,JNJ,J&J; says women being illegally solicited to join in mesh lawsuits,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said in a court filing on Wednesday that women are being illegally solicited by unknown callers trying to persuade them to sue over transvaginal mesh devices, which are the subject of more than 35,000 lawsuits against its Ethicon Inc subsidiary. In the filing, Johnson & Johnson said it had received numerous reports from women about unsolicited phone calls from strangers who either knew their private medical details, like the fact that they had recently had surgery, or were fishing for similar information. The callers appear to be misusing private medical information protected under U.S. law, the filing said. The filing asked U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin in the Southern District of West Virginia - who oversees federal mesh cases - to allow for an investigation of the calls. Plaintiffs should be required to offer proof they were injured by an Ethicon device, and all plaintiffs’ lawyers in the cases against Ethicon should answer questions under oath about any knowledge of direct telephone solicitation, which is prohibited by American Bar Association rules and outlawed in some states, the filing said. The unknown callers - some of whom purported to be from Johnson & Johnson or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration - told the women they could receive up to $40,000 if they filed a suit over Ethicon mesh, the filing alleged. A lead plaintiffs’ lawyer in the litigation, Bryan Aylstock, called the motion a “baseless attempt” to avoid responsibility for the devices. Johnson & Johnson is one of seven manufacturers facing more than 70,000 federal lawsuits before Goodwin over mesh devices, used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The cases have resulted in several multimillion-dollar verdicts so far against Ethicon as well as other manufacturers including Boston Scientific and C.R. Bard. The companies have denied liability. No plaintiffs’ firms were accused of specific wrongdoing. But the filing noted that firms have spent millions of dollars on advertisements for transvaginal mesh, and stand to earn more if more clients file lawsuits that are eventually settled. Johnson & Johnson said the calls could be a significant factor in the flood of lawsuits it has faced over mesh, which it said was considered the “gold standard” for treating stress urinary incontinence. Johnson & Johnson spokesman Ernie Knewitz said the company was “compelled to report these activities to the judge” after receiving reports from women about the calls.",1142015,http://www.reuters.com/article/johnsonandjohnson-ethicon-mesh/jj-says-women-being-illegally-solicited-to-join-in-mesh-lawsuits-idUSL1N0UT2D420150114

727,JNJ,J&J; Ebola vaccine gets 100 million euros to speed development,"LONDON (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Friday that newly formed groups supporting work on its experimental Ebola vaccine would receive 100 million euros ($115 million) from Europe’s Innovative Medicines Initiative to speed development. The U.S. drugmaker earlier this month announced it had started clinical trials of its two-injection vaccine, which uses a booster from Denmark’s Bavarian Nordic, making it the third such product to enter human testing.  J&J; has been seeking partners after committing up to $200 million to accelerate its Ebola vaccine program in October. The new initiative will see J&J; join with institutions including the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the University of Oxford and the Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale to form consortia working on different aspects of vaccine development. Europe’s Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) is a public-private scheme jointly paid for by the European Commission and the pharmaceuticals industry. The IMI said in November it would invest 280 million euros in Ebola research, with the lion’s share going to vaccines.

The dollar gained nearly 13 percent against a basket of major currencies in 2014, its strongest performance since 1997.  Revenue in J&J;’s pharmaceuticals business rose 9.6 percent in the quarter, driven by higher sales of new drugs such as hepatitis C drug Olysio and older treatments such as psoriasis drug Stelara.

730,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson's forex warning a sign for rival drugmakers,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) surprised investors by detailing the degree to which a strong dollar will hurt sales abroad this year, and industry watchers say Wall Street is underestimating the likely hit to other U.S.-based rivals such as Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck & Co (MRK.N). J&J;, the first large U.S. drugmaker to report fourth-quarter results, on Tuesday said sales fell 0.6 percent to $18.25 billion, but would have risen 3.9 percent if not for the stronger dollar. The 4.5 percent foreign exchange hit compared with an average 0.9 percent headwind in the first three quarters of the year.  The diversified healthcare company now expects a foreign currency hit to earnings in 2015 of as much as 42 cents per share, versus the 15 cents to 20 cents it forecast in October. “Foreign exchange will be a focal point for the whole drug group” in the fourth quarter and 2015, said John Boris, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. He predicted the stronger dollar will take a bigger bite out of other drugmakers’ earnings than many expect, and said Pfizer and Merck are among the most vulnerable because they both derive more than 60 percent of their sales outside the United States. A spokeswoman for Pfizer declined to comment, saying the company will discuss the impact of foreign exchange when it reports quarterly results on Jan 27. Merck officials could not immediately be reached for comment. J&J; shares fell 2.6 percent on Tuesday, while the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index .DRG of U.S. and European drugmakers was little changed.  “The market today is very much focused on J&J;, but companies like J&J; with a big global footprint are also at risk,” said Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss, who cited Pfizer as among the most vulnerable. Indianapolis drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY.N) said earlier this month it expects foreign exchange “headwinds” in 2015, but would not give details until it reports quarterly earnings on Jan. 30. Almost 55 percent of its sales are from outside the United States. The dollar .DXY gained nearly 13 percent against a basket of major currencies in 2014, its strongest performance since 1997. For U.S.-based companies, the stronger dollar hurts the value of sales in overseas markets.  Boris said sales of innovative new drugs from J&J; and rival drugmakers - such as treatments for cancer, diabetes and hepatitis C - could still mitigate the foreign currency impact and help them deliver double-digit industry earnings growth over the next five years.

734,JNJ,J&J;'s $7.2 bln claim against Boston Scientific now with U.S. judge,"NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - For more than eight years, Johnson & Johnson has pursued billions of dollars in damages against Boston Scientific Corp after the latter won a controversial - and ultimately ill-fated - bidding war for device maker Guidant. Now the dispute lies in the hands of a federal judge after lawyers for both companies made final presentations on Wednesday at the close of a non-jury trial in New York federal court. J&J; is seeking more than $7.2 billion in damages and interest from Boston Scientific as Guidant’s successor, an amount that one analyst has characterized as a “major near-term risk” for a company with a market capitalization of about $19 billion as of Wednesday. U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan, who oversaw the trial, did not indicate when he would rule. The dispute stems from 2005, when J&J; agreed to buy Guidant for $21.5 billion. Under the deal, Guidant was permitted to consider unsolicited competing bids. In late 2005, Boston Scientific announced its intention to make an offer, which was contingent on selling some of Guidant’s assets to Abbott Laboratories to satisfy antitrust concerns. J&J; claims Guidant knowingly violated their contract by providing due diligence directly to Abbott. Without that breach, J&J; argues, Abbott would have walked away from the deal, scuttling Boston Scientific’s bid and leaving Guidant with no competing offers. “What made the breach material was that Boston Scientific was not going to make an offer if Abbott was not involved,” said Harold Weinberger, a lawyer for J&J.; David Boies, a lawyer for Boston Scientific, said Guidant relied on the advice of its attorneys in sharing information with Abbott. Boston Scientific eventually acquired Guidant for $27 billion and paid J&J; a $705 million termination fee. The deal has since been widely panned as too expensive, prompting Boston Scientific to argue that J&J; dodged a bullet by failing to complete the acquisition and cannot now claim any damages, even if a breach occurred. “They have not presented any evidence that they would have been better off,” Boies said. Sullivan pressed both sides during more than two hours of closing arguments. At one point, he questioned why J&J; did not aggressively challenge Guidant as soon as they became aware that Abbott had been given information in January 2006, instead of making subsequent higher bids. “There’s a glaring absence of the sorts of emails and documents you would expect if you thought you had just been hosed on a multibillion-dollar deal,” he said. Weinberger said J&J; was not fully aware of what had occurred until weeks later, after the bidding war ended.

735,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson's $7.2 billion claim against Boston Scientific now with U.S. judge,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - For more than eight years, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) has pursued billions of dollars in damages against Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N) after the latter won a controversial – and ultimately ill-fated – bidding war for device maker Guidant. Now the dispute lies in the hands of a federal judge after lawyers for both companies made final presentations on Wednesday at the close of a non-jury trial in New York federal court. J&J; is seeking more than $7.2 billion in damages and interest from Boston Scientific as Guidant’s successor, an amount that one analyst has characterized as a “major near-term risk” for a company with a market capitalization of about $19 billion as of Wednesday. U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan, who oversaw the trial, did not indicate when he would rule. The dispute stems from 2005, when J&J; agreed to buy Guidant for $21.5 billion. Under the deal, Guidant was permitted to consider unsolicited competing bids. In late 2005, Boston Scientific announced its intention to make an offer, which was contingent on selling some of Guidant’s assets to Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) to satisfy antitrust concerns. J&J; claims Guidant knowingly violated their contract by providing due diligence directly to Abbott. Without that breach, J&J; argues, Abbott would have walked away from the deal, scuttling Boston Scientific’s bid and leaving Guidant with no competing offers. “What made the breach material was that Boston Scientific was not going to make an offer if Abbott was not involved,” said Harold Weinberger, a lawyer for J&J.; David Boies, a lawyer for Boston Scientific, said Guidant relied on the advice of its attorneys in sharing information with Abbott. Boston Scientific eventually acquired Guidant for $27 billion and paid J&J; a $705 million termination fee. The deal has since been widely panned as too expensive, prompting Boston Scientific to argue that J&J; dodged a bullet by failing to complete the acquisition and cannot now claim any damages, even if a breach occurred. “They have not presented any evidence that they would have been better off,” Boies said. Sullivan pressed both sides during more than two hours of closing arguments. At one point, he questioned why J&J; did not aggressively challenge Guidant as soon as they became aware that Abbott had been given information in January 2006, instead of making subsequent higher bids. “There’s a glaring absence of the sorts of emails and documents you would expect if you thought you had just been hosed on a multibillion-dollar deal,” he said. Weinberger said J&J; was not fully aware of what had occurred until weeks later, after the bidding war ended.

737,JNJ,Plaintiffs’ lawyers reject J&J; claims of fraud in mesh lawsuits,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for thousands of women suing Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Inc over transvaginal mesh devices are fighting back against the company’s claim that illegal phone solicitations may have resulted in baseless lawsuits. Plaintiffs’ lawyers said in a court filing late Thursday there was “no evidence of fraud” tainting nearly 23,000 federal mesh injury lawsuits, which have been consolidated before U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin in the Southern District of West Virginia.  The filing came in response to a motion last week from Johnson & Johnson asking Goodwin to allow an investigation into whether women are being illegally solicited to join mesh litigation by unknown callers, some of whom seemed to have knowledge of private medical data. The company said it was concerned the calls may have resulted in bogus claims.  J&J; has asked Goodwin to make plaintiffs offer proof they had been injured by an Ethicon device, and have their lawyers answer questions under oath about any knowledge of solicitation calls. While strongly denouncing the “rogue call center’s shenanigans,” lead plaintiffs’ lawyers said J&J; was using the calls to justify imposing unnecessary and burdensome measures that “would grind this litigation to a screeching halt.” Lead plaintiffs’ counsel said they had raised a similar issue more than a year ago with Goodwin, after several clients told them they had received, unsolicited, a letter from a call center bearing the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s logo and promising $25,000 in compensation. They turned the letter over to the judge and asked him to investigate, the filing said.  “We thought it was improper at the time, and still do,” said plaintiffs’ lawyer Henry Garrard in an email.  J&J; could show no direct link between the calls and plaintiffs’ firms, the filing said. Furthermore, random sampling of the Ethicon cases last year showed that plaintiffs had all been implanted with mesh, although a handful had mistakenly identified the maker of their device, the filing said.  Ethicon spokeswoman Samantha Lucas said the company was still reviewing the filing. “Based on the reports we received, we were compelled to report these activities to the judge,” she said in a statement.  Ethicon is one of seven companies that collectively face more than 70,000 suits before Goodwin over transvaginal mesh devices, used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Women claim the devices were defective, resulting in painful complications like infection, nerve damage and bleeding.

740,JNJ,New sponsors ready to replace old say beleaguered FIFA,"LONDON (Reuters) - FIFA have rejected suggestions that major sponsors were cutting their ties with the organization because it was a “toxic brand”, saying on Friday that they were in advanced negotiations with new sponsors eager to replace the old. Britain’s Daily Telegraph revealed on Friday that three major sponsors, Continental, Castrol and Johnson & Johnson, were not renewing their contracts with world soccer’s governing body. Emirates Airlines and Sony announced last year that they were also severing their ties with FIFA. But FIFA’s marketing director Thierry Weil told Reuters on Friday that those companies contracts with FIFA were always due to expire at the end of last year and new ones were negotiating to take their place. “Rotations at the end of a sponsorship cycle are commonplace in the sports industry and have continuously occurred since the commercialisation of the FIFA World Cup began,” Weil said. “It is natural that as brands’ strategies evolve they reassess their sponsorship properties. The contracts were always planned to run until the end of 2014. “As in previous FIFA World Cup cycles, we are now in advanced negotiations with a number of companies related to sponsorship agreements in all three of our categories. But not everyone is convinced that FIFA, who have been buffeted by one crisis after another over the last few years, is still a name sponsors want to be associated with. Damian Collins, the British MP and the guiding light behind the pressure group New FIFA Now which was launched in Brussels on Wednesday, said he believed sponsors were cutting ties as a result of the scandals and controversies that continually surround FIFA. “FIFA is a toxic brand,” Collins was quoted as saying in the Daily Telegraph. “I think that’s why companies who care about their reputation don’t want to be considered with it.” Sponsors bring in at least $1.5 billion in revenue over each four-year cycle.  Castrol had been a World Cup sponsor since 2008, Continental Tyres since 2010 and Johnson & Johnson signed a deal for a single cycle in 2011.  Meanwhile the sportswear company SKINS, whose chairman Jamie Fuller was a delegate at the launch of New FIFA Now, launched a light-hearted “non-sponsorship” relationship with the governing body. In a statement on Friday the company said: “The non-multi-million pound, announcement allows the company to highlight unshared brand values and confirms SKINS’ contempt for an organisation which has been constantly shrouded in allegations of corruption and controversy, yet is potentially preparing to re-elect its President Sepp Blatter for an unprecedented fifth term in office. “This anti-FIFA stance is intended to be fun and engaging but it carries a very serious message in support of newfifanow.org.” (Refile to fix lit in third-last par (light-hearted sted heated)) ",1232015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-fifa-sponsors/new-sponsors-ready-to-replace-old-say-beleaguered-fifa-idUSKBN0KW17020150123
741,JNJ,FDA expands use of Imbruvica to treat rare form of blood cancer,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the expanded use of Imbruvica, sold by Johnson & Johnson and Pharmacyclics Inc, to treat Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM), a rare form of blood cancer for which no specific pharmaceutical therapy exists. The decision, announced more than two months before the scheduled review date, marks the fourth indication for the drug.   WM, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, was discovered more than 70 years ago. It usually worsens slowly over time and causes abnormal blood cells, known as B lymphocytes (B-cells), to grow within the bone marrow, lymph nodes, liver and spleen. Imbruvica works by blocking the enzyme that allows abnormal B-cells to grow and divide. Since WM was first described, doctors have had to rely on therapies borrowed from similar cancers, said Steven Treon, who led the trial that led to the approval for expanded use. The FDA granted Imbruvica breakthrough therapy designation for WM, a status given to drugs seen as important advances in the treatment of serious diseases, but it added a warning that it could cause tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is a potentially life-threatening disorder that occurs when a treatment kills cancer cells so quickly that the kidneys cannot expel the breakdown products from the blood. Since its initial approval in late 2013, the number of safety warnings associated with Imbruvica have increased, said Elliot Favus of Favus Institutional Research, adding that the number of cases of TLS for Imbruvica had risen in the past year. “We’re learning a lot more about the safety of the drug and it’s not as good as people originally thought when it was first approved,” Favus said. In contrast, a potential rival drug being developed by AbbVie Inc and Roche Holding AG, ABT-199, has reduced the number of TLS cases in recent trials, he said. Imbruvica is already used to fight chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Mantle cell lymphoma. The approval for WM highlights the strength of the franchise, although the disease occurs only in up to 1,500 patients in the United States each year, Roth Capital Partner’s Joseph Pantginis wrote in a note. Pharmacyclics anticipates U.S. net product revenue of about $1 billion for the drug in 2015, up from $492 million in 2014, the company said earlier this month. Pharmacyclics shares closed 1.25 percent higher at $167.47, while J&J;’s stock ended up about 0.9 percent at $102.38.

In a court filing late Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson’s lawyers moved to withdraw a Jan. 14 motion that had asked U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin in the Southern District of West Virginia - who oversees federal mesh litigation - to allow for an investigation into the source of the calls. During a hearing last week in West Virginia, Goodwin told lawyers in the mesh cases that some recent motions have “not been helpful” in establishing the “mutual trust” needed to find a resolution to the litigation. The filing did not elaborate on the reason for withdrawing the motion and the company didn’t return a request for comment. Bryan Aylstock, the lead plaintiffs’ lawyer, said he was pleased with Ethicon’s decision and that both sides have “pledged to work together to attempt to put an end to any wrongful solicitations of clients.” Johnson & Johnson is one of seven manufacturers that together face 70,000 lawsuits before Goodwin over injuries alleged to have been caused by mesh devices, which are used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. Plaintiffs say the devices are defective and can cause painful side effects like bleeding, infection and nerve damage. Ethicon’s Jan. 14 court motion said it had received numerous reports from women about unsolicited phone calls from strangers who either knew their private medical details or were fishing for similar information. The callers, some of whom purported to be from Johnson & Johnson or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, told women they could receive up to $40,000 if they filed a lawsuit, according to the court filing. The company suggested the calls and other dodgy solicitation tactics could be a significant factor in the flood of lawsuits it has faced over mesh, which it called the “gold standard” for treating stress urinary incontinence. More than 35,000 claims have been filed in state and federal court over Ethicon mesh. Plaintiffs’ lawyers had opposed the request in a reply filed Jan. 22.

While Fitch views the settlement as a positive development in terms of reducing  the uncertainty surrounding the potential financial liability from the lawsuit,  the $600 million dollar payment will reduce the availability of cash in the  short term. Nevertheless, Fitch believes that BSX will maintain adequate  liquidity through FCF generation, balance sheet cash and access to its revolving  credit facility. As such, BSX will be able to operate competitively with  expected improving operations and without stressing its balance sheet. In the lawsuit against BSX, JNJ alleged that Guidant knowingly violated their  acquisition agreement with JNJ by providing due diligence activities to Abbott  Laboratories (Abbott), particularly regarding its drug eluting stent platform.  JNJ stated that BSX would not have succeeded in acquiring Guidant, had Guidant  not provided that information to Abbott. Both sides presented their arguments in  U.S. District Court and were awaiting the judge's decision. The uncertainty  regarding the judge's ruling the prospects for a continued legal battle likely  helped motivate both sides to settle the dispute. The $600 million cash settlement is within the range of Fitch's forecasts and  was incorporated in the company's current credit rating. RATING SENSITIVITIES: Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include the following: --Continued operational improvements that support long-term positive revenue  growth and margin stability/improvement; --An operational profile that could lead to significant and durable increases in  FCF; --Cash deployment policy and resulting capital structure that would durably  sustain leverage below 2.2 times (x)-2.3x. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include the following:  --Material and lasting deterioration in operations and FCF; --Persistent increase in leverage approaching 3.0x; --Leveraging acquisitions without the prospect of timely debt/leverage  reduction; --Large legal settlement(s) that would need to be funded with significant debt  issuance(s). RATINGS: Fitch currently rates Boston Scientific Corp. as follows: --Long-term IDR 'BBB-'; --Unsecured bank credit facility 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

753,JNJ,J&J-Pharmacyclics; drug shows potential in high-risk leukemia patients,"(Reuters) - Pharmacyclics Inc said its cancer drug developed with a Johnson & Johnson unit improved overall response rate in high-risk leukemia patients. Those administered with Imbruvica showed an overall response rate of 88 percent, while 76.6 percent survived without the disease getting worse at 24 months. All 16 patients enrolled in the small study suffered from high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and had failed to benefit from stem cell transplants and other therapies. Patients who relapse of CLL following stem cell transplant are hard to treat with chemotherapy as they do not produce enough blood cells or develop post-transplant complications. This could be a new patient population for the drug, which is already approved for a number of other indications associated with CLL. Imbruvica is already approved for CLL patients who have received at least one prior therapy, and for CLL patients with a rare genetic mutation. About 115,000 patients suffer from CLL in the United States and about 16,000 are newly diagnosed each year. Shares of Pharmacyclics were up 1.4 percent at $165.69 in early trading on the Nasdaq.

759,JNJ,South Carolina court orders J&J; to pay $136 mln in Risperdal case,"(Reuters) - South Carolina’s Supreme Court ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay a penalty of $136 million, upholding a jury’s finding that the drugmaker’s Janssen unit had improperly marketed its anti-psychotic drug Risperdal and concealed its risks. A trial court had earlier ordered J&J; to pay $327 million, but the Supreme Court more than halved that penalty, citing a provision in South Carolina law that no action can be taken in such cases after three years of the discovery of unlawful conduct. South Carolina filed its complaint in April 2007. “Janssen’s desire for market share and increased sales knew no bounds, leading to its egregious violation of South Carolina law,” Justice John Kittredge wrote in the ruling on Wednesday. “Yet, the absence of significant actual harm resulting from Janssen’s deceptive conduct leads us to conclude the trial court erred in part in its penalty assessment.” J&J; spokeswoman Pamela Van Houten did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The state had sought civil penalties on two claims. The first arose from the content of the written material of Risperdal prescriptions since 1994. The second claim centered on alleged false information contained in a November 2003 letter Janssen sent to South Carolina’s prescribing physicians. The South Carolina ruling conflicts with decisions by two other states’ high courts last year. J&J; won a reversal of a $1.2 billion judgment by the Arkansas Supreme Court and won an appeal in Louisiana on a $258 million penalty. Risperdal, launched in 1994, is used to treat conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and irritability in people with autism.

Cardinal, one of the largest U.S. drug distribution companies, is expanding its medical equipment offerings for physicians. “While this transaction is not without obvious risks and does mark a change in CAH’s overall business mix/business model, we believe the financial attractiveness outweighs this fact,” Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said in a research note.

767,JNJ,J&J; nearing deal to buy cancer drug maker Pharmacyclics - FT,"March 4 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is close to buying cancer drug maker Pharmacyclics Inc in the coming days, the Financial Times reported, citing sources. A bid from J&J; is expected to value Pharmacyclics near its $17.5 billion market value or at a premium, FT said on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. (on.ft.com/1NhRGo3) Shares of Pharmacyclics, which markets blood cancer drug Imbruvica with J&J;’s Janssen unit, rose about 3 percent in extended trading. Sales of Imbruvica, which has U.S. approvals for four forms of blood cancer, are expected to touch $1 billion in the United States this year, Pharmacyclics has said earlier. Bloomberg reported last month, citing sources, that Pharmacyclics was mulling a sale and had attracted the interest of J&J; and Novartis AG. Any interest from J&J; would be logical, considering its already established relationship with Pharmacyclics, Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville told Reuters. Sunnyvale, California-based Pharmacyclics’ shares were trading at $238 after the bell. Up to Wednesday’s close, the stock had risen about 22 percent since the Bloomberg report on Feb. 25.

769,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $5.7 million in California mesh trial,"(Reuters) - A California jury on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Inc unit to pay $5.7 million in the first trial over injuries blamed on the TVT Abbrevo, one of numerous transvaginal mesh products that are the subject of thousands of lawsuits.   Following more than three days of deliberations in Kern County, California, jurors found Ethicon liable for problems with the TVT Abbrevo’s design and for failing to warn about its risks, according to a lawyer for plaintiff Coleen Perry.  Perry was awarded $700,000 in compensatory damages and an additional $5 million in punitive damages after jurors in the Bakersfield court found Ethicon’s conduct amounted to “malice,” her lawyer said.  The verdict is the fourth win for plaintiffs suing Ethicon over transvaginal mesh. More than 36,000 lawsuits have been filed against Ethicon in state and federal courts over the devices, which are used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.  The Abbrevo, one of Ethicon’s newer models of mesh products, was cleared for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2010 to treat stress urinary incontinence. Perry, who was implanted with it in 2011, said she began experiencing a “pulling-type” pain almost immediately after surgery.  Perry said the mesh began to erode in her body, causing pain that she said she expects to last the rest of her life, according to testimony Reuters saw on Courtroom View Network.  Ethicon’s lawyers said the product was thoroughly vetted before it hit the market and that doctors considered the mesh used in the Abbrevo to be the “gold standard” for incontinence treatment.  Peter de la Cerda, a lawyer for Perry, said the verdict sent a “clear message to Ethicon” about its “improper conduct in designing and marketing the Abbrevo.”  Ethicon spokesman Matthew Johnson said the company believed it has strong grounds for appeal. Ethicon stands behind the safety and effectiveness of the Abbrevo, as well as its development and marketing, he added.

774,JNJ,Tylenol maker to pay $25 mln for selling metal-contaminated drugs,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Johnson & Johnson  subsidiary pleaded guilty on Tuesday to selling liquid medicine contaminated with metal and agreed to pay $25 million to resolve the case, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Tuesday. The subsidiary, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, pleaded guilty to one federal criminal charge in the case. In 2010, the company launched mass recalls of certain children’s over-the-counter-medicines, including Infants’ Tylenol and Children’s Motrin, made at its Fort Washington, Pennsylvania plant. It was the latest in a series of recalls at the time. There were far-reaching multiple recalls from 2008 to 2010 involving hundreds of millions of bottles and packages of consumer brands such as Tylenol, Motrin, Rolaids, Benadryl and other products due to faulty manufacturing. The recalls kept widely used products such as Children’s Tylenol off pharmacy shelves and seriously tarnished J&J;’s once-sterling reputation. In addition to metal particles getting into liquid medicines, there were moldy odors and labeling problems. For example, the label for Sudafed allergy tablets incorrectly repeated the word “not” to say “do not not divide, crush, chew or dissolve the tablet.” In the case involving metal particles, the troubles began in May 2009 when a consumer complained after noticing “black specks” in the bottom of a bottle of Infants’ Tylenol. The specks were found to be nickel and chromium particles. In 2010, Johnson & Johnson’s U.S. consumer product sales fell by more than 19 percent, a decrease of $900 million. The rash of consumer medicine recalls in 2009 and 2010 were largely responsible for the first back-to-back years of company sales declines since World War Two. Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman for McNeil Consumer Healthcare, said the plea agreement “closes a chapter” and that the company has “been implementing enhanced quality and oversight standards across its entire business.” As part of the agreement, McNeil also agreed to further safety measures before reopening its Fort Washington facility.

777,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson sues Glaxo over allergy ads as spring nears,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson sued rival drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline PLC on Thursday, alleging that Glaxo is trying to unlawfully grab market share with false advertising at the start of spring allergy season in the United States.

785,JNJ,"J&J;, Glaxo settle U.S. lawsuit over allergy ads","NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc  has agreed to settle a lawsuit by Johnson & Johnson  accusing it of using false advertising at the start of the U.S. allergy season to grab market share. The settlement was disclosed during a hearing in Manhattan federal court on Monday in which two Johnson & Johnson units were expected to ask a judge to block Glaxo from making various claims about its allergy nasal spray Flonase, records show. Terms of the settlement were not immediately available. Jodie Wertheim, a Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman, said the company was pleased to have reached a mutually acceptable and amicable settlement. A spokeswoman for Glaxo had no immediate comment. Glaxo received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sell Flonase over the counter in July, setting the stage for greater competition. J&J; units McNeil-PPC Inc and McNeil Consumer Healthcare filed the lawsuit on March 12, accusing Glaxo of making unsupported claims about Flonase at the expense of McNeil’s drugs Benadryl and Zyrtec. A Glaxo TV spot cited in the lawsuit said that Flonase outperforms the No. 1 allergy pill, which the ad does not name, and controls six allergy symptoms versus one by the other pill. The McNeil units said studies do not support the claims. McNeil said it stood to be harmed with the prime allergy sales season quickly approaching, and sought an injunction. The case is McNeil-PPC Inc and McNeil Consumer Healthcare v. GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare LP, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 15-1866.

788,JNJ,Wall Street ends higher after bounce in oil prices,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P; 500 ended higher on Tuesday, helped by energy stocks and quarterly earnings reports that topped modest expectations following worries about a strong dollar. Shares of Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other energy companies followed crude higher after a forecast that U.S. shale oil output in May would record its first monthly decline in more than four years. The S&P; 500 energy index jumped 1.77 percent. Norfolk Southern Corp dropped 4.18 percent to $100.49 a day after it forecast a surprise drop in its first-quarter earnings and revenue. A strong dollar, cheap oil and poor weather in the eastern United States in recent months have investors bracing for a difficult March-quarter earnings season. First-quarter profits for S&P; 500 companies are seen falling 2.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. On Jan. 1, analysts had been looking for growth of 5.3 percent.  Those lowered expectations mean that companies can now more easily impress investors, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.  “This may be one of most hated earnings seasons I remember,” Hogan said. “We’ve taken those three negative headwinds and plowed them as far as we can into the worst-case scenario.” Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co rose 1.6 percent after the biggest U.S. bank by assets reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit.  The Dow Jones industrial average rose 59.66 points, or 0.33 percent, to end at 18,036.7. The S&P; 500 gained 3.41 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,095.84 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 10.96 points, or 0.22 percent, to 4,977.29, with Apple down 0.43 percent. After the bell, Intel Corp  forecast revenue broadly in line with Wall Street’s low expectations and signaled a hefty cut in capital expenditures this year, sending its shares up 2.6 percent. U.S. railroad CSX Corp reported a higher quarterly net profit and announced a $2 billion share repurchase program, sending its shares 3.43 percent higher in extended trade. During the regular session, Chevron’s shares gained 2.2 percent and Exxon rose 1.5 percent.    Nokia Oyj is in talks to buy Alcatel-Lucent SA, a deal that would combine the telecommunications industry’s two weakest players.  U.S. shares of Nokia fell 4.09 percent to $7.96 while Alcatel rose 13.33 percent to $4.93. Companies expected to report this week include GE, Philip Morris International Inc and Bank of America Corp.  The dollar was down 0.75 percent against a basket of major currencies, leaving it with a gain of nearly 10 percent so far in 2015. A stronger dollar tends to hurt profits for U.S. multinationals.

789,JNJ,J&J; cuts full-year forecast due to strong dollar,"(Reuters) - Healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson cut its full-year profit forecast on Tuesday, saying it expected a strong dollar to keep hurting its international business. J&J;, which reported higher-than-expected quarterly results, warned in January that the dollar’s strength could reduce earnings by 42 cents per share this year. The company gets half of its revenue from abroad.  The dollar gained nearly 9 percent against a basket of major currencies in the first quarter after rising 13 percent in 2014. A stronger dollar lowers the value of sales in foreign markets.  J&J; lowered its full-year profit forecast to between $6.04 and $6.19 per share from its prior outlook of $6.12 to $6.27. It earned $5.97 last year. “Every large multinational healthcare company will be affected this quarter by the stronger dollar, along with the rest of corporate America,” said Stifel Nicolaus & Co analyst Rick Wise. J&J;’s sales of medical devices and consumer products fell sharply in the first quarter, hurt by rival brands and the strong dollar. The bright spot in J&J;’s earnings report was U.S. sales of pharmaceuticals, which jumped 17 percent on demand for new treatments for diabetes, blood cancers, prostate cancer and blood clots. Global pharmaceutical sales rose 3 percent to $7.7 billion even as the stronger dollar held them back by 7.2 percent. Investors have been concerned that Celltrion Inc might get U.S. regulatory approval of a cheaper “biosimilar” form of J&J;’s $6 billion-a-year Remicade arthritis treatment before the branded drug loses patent protection in September 2018. J&J; has appealed the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s recent rejection of Remicade’s basic patent. Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso on Tuesday said the company would be entitled to a series of appeals that could assure Remicade’s marketing exclusivity for almost three years. “It was encouraging to hear their confidence that they can continue to delay the biosimilar’s launch,” said Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans.  J&J;’s quarterly net profit fell to $4.32 billion, or $1.53 per share, from $4.73 billion, or $1.64 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items such as writedowns of intangible assets, J&J; earned $1.56 per share, beating the analysts’ average estimate of $1.54, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The dour report from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday was the latest sign that growth slowed sharply in the first quarter and suggested the U.S. central bank could delay raising interest rates until later this year. Snowy winter weighed on activity early in 2015. Labor disruptions at normally busy West Coast ports, as well as the dollar and softer global demand have been a constraint. “This provides some confirmation on the disappointing growth performance in the first quarter. The absence of a lift in the other forward-looking indicators suggests that the U.S. economic recovery is struggling to regain any traction,” said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. Industrial production fell 0.6 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in February, the Fed said. March’s decline was the largest since August 2012 and was worse than economists’ expectations for only a 0.3 percent drop. A 17.7 percent plunge in oil and gas well drilling pulled mining production down 0.7 percent in March, marking the third straight month of declines in mining output. Crude oil has lost more than half of its value since last June, resulting in a sharp drop in well drilling activity. Companies in the oil field are also either postponing or cutting back on capital expenditure projects. Separately, the Fed in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide said investment in oil and gas drilling had declined and related layoffs were reported by “multiple” regions. Caterpillar Inc early this year cut its 2015 profit outlook and warned lower oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business. Last month, utilities production tumbled 5.9 percent, also weighing on industrial production. “We do not see the emerging picture as supporting the hand of those who have been arguing for an earlier Fed rate hike,” said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. Most economists have pushed back their expectations for the first rate hike to either September or October from June. Others believe monetary policy will only be tightened in 2016. The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since December 2008. Data including for retail sales, housing starts, inventories, trade and manufacturing suggest the economy grew at a sub-1.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter after a 2.2 percent pace in the October-December quarter. U.S. Treasury prices rose as the data supported bets the Fed was likely to wait longer to raise rates. Stocks rose while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. For the first quarter, industrial production declined at an annual rate of 1.0 percent, the first quarterly decrease since the second quarter of 2009. Oil and gas well drilling and servicing, which tumbled at a 69.8 percent rate, accounted for the bulk of the drop in industrial output in the first quarter. While manufacturing output ticked up 0.1 percent in March, the first gain since last November, it fell at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter, the first decline since the second quarter of 2009. The soft trend could persist for a while. In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index fell to -1.19 in April from March’s 6.90. This was the first negative read for the index since December. The weakness in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been attributed to the buoyant dollar, bad weather and supply chain disruptions from the ports dispute. Softer growth in Europe and Asia, especially China where the economy expanded at its slowest pace in six years in the first quarter, has also been a drag. The dollar has gained 13 percent against the United States’ main trading partners since last June, which economists say is equivalent to a 0.5 percentage point interest rate hike. “The dollar’s strength may be taking some of the oomph out of factory production, which had been on a tear until December last year,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at  MUFG Union Bank in New York. “Time will tell whether this is real weakness or simply a bump on the road to prosperity. Our guess remains the economy comes back strong later on this spring.” Companies like Microsoft Corp and Procter & Gamble Co, the world’s largest household products maker, and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson have warned  the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.

797,JNJ,J&J; to consult ethicists on requests for experimental drugs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson will become the first pharmaceutical company to formally seek advice from outside medical ethicists on “compassionate use” requests, in which desperate patients ask drugmakers to let them take an experimental medication, the company announced on Thursday. The ethicists’ recommendations will be advisory, with J&J; making the decision.

799,JNJ,FDA warns on newer class of type 2 diabetes drugs,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday warned that a widely used newer class of type 2 diabetes drugs sold by AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly in partnership with Boehringer Ingleheim may cause dangerously high levels of blood acids that could require hospitalization. The oral drugs belong to a class known as SGLT2 inhibitors that work by causing blood sugar to be secreted in the urine. They include AstraZeneca’s Farxiga (dapagliflozin), J&J;’s Invokana (canagliflozin) and Jardiance (embagliflozin) from Lilly and Boehringer. The FDA, in a warning on its website, said the medicines may lead to ketoacidosis, a serious condition where the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. The FDA said its Adverse Event Reporting System database identified 20 cases of acidosis reported as diabetic ketoacidosis, ketoacidosis, or ketosis in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors between March 2013 to June 6, 2014. It said all the affected patients required emergency room visits or hospitalization to treat the condition. Since June 2014, the agency said it had continued to receive additional adverse event reports of diabetic ketoacidosis and ketoacidosis in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. The FDA warning also listed three combination type 2 diabetes treatments that include an SGLT2 drug as one of its two components, J&J;’s Invokamet, Xigduo XR from AstraZeneca and Lilly and Boehringer’s Glyxambi. The medicines became popular in part because in addition to controlling blood sugar levels, they led to modest weight loss and slightly lower blood pressure. Obesity is a leading cause of type 2 diabetes and some older treatments cause weight gain. But the new FDA warning could help boost sales of alternative medicines, such as Merck & Co’s Januvia. “Inasmuch as there will be heightened awareness of this new safety issue with the SGLT2s, it could benefit other oral diabetes drug classes such as the DPP4 inhibitors,” Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note. “The biggest of the DPP4s, by a wide margin, is Merck’s Januvia.” Januvia, which had sales of about $6 billion in 2014, is Merck’s top-selling product. A series of heart safety studies, for which data recently became available, appears to have absolved the DPP4 class of concerns that had been constraining their sales.

805,JNJ,J&J; to submit at least 10 new drugs for approval by 2019,"(Reuters) - U.S. healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson said on Wednesday it expects to submit more than 10 new medicines with annual revenue potential of at least $1 billion each to regulators by 2019, and is testing dozens of new uses for existing medicines. J&J; said it would file for approval of daratumumab for the blood cancer multiple myeloma in the United States and Europe this year based on mid-stage clinical data. Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen forecast daratumumab sales reaching $1.3 billion by 2019. The company is looking to bounce back from previous failure in Alzheimer’s disease with multiple programs, including an early-stage drug it believes has the potential to prevent amyloid plaque buildup in the brain and another that aims to clear it. Pharmaceuticals has been a bright spot for the company at a time when its medical devices and consumer products have seen sharp declines, hurt by competition and the strong dollar. During a pharmaceutical pipeline review for analysts and investors, J&J; outlined an ambitious portfolio of drugs in development aimed at sustaining above-industry compound annual growth through 2019. The industry rate over that period is expected to be about 3 percent. The review comes as the industry prepares for the introduction of copycat versions of expensive biologic drugs, such as J&J;’s rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment Remicade, which has annual U.S. sales of more than $4 billion and a patent that expires in 2018. J&J;’s worldwide pharmaceuticals head Joaquin Duato said he believes Remicade’s established safety would be an advantage over eventual biosimilar newcomers. “Biosimilars are not generics and we expect the market to behave quite differently,” Duato said. Still, the company highlighted a new antibody for RA being developed with GlaxoSmithKline, and one for psoriasis that it touted as more effective that Abbott’s big-selling Humira. The company is targeting Crohn’s disease with a new drug being developed along with a companion diagnostic aimed at identifying patients likely to have the best response, and is beginning Phase III trials of a promising drug for treatment resistant depression.

811,JNJ,WRAPUP 4-U.S. economy contracts in Q1; dollar hurts corporate profits,"(Adds consumer sentiment, factory data, updates markets) * First-quarter GDP revised down to show contraction * GDP shrinks at a 0.7 percent annual rate * Trade, inventories account for bulk of revision * Strong dollar weighs on Q1 corporate profits By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, May 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter as it buckled under the weight of unusually heavy snowfalls, a resurgent dollar and disruptions at West Coast ports, but activity already has rebounded modestly. The government on Friday slashed its gross domestic product estimate to show GDP shrinking at a 0.7 percent annual rate instead of the 0.2 percent growth pace it estimated last month. A larger trade deficit and a smaller accumulation of inventories by businesses than previously thought accounted for much of the downward revision. There was also a modest downward revision to consumer spending. With growth estimates for the second quarter currently around 2 percent, the economy appears poised for its worst first-half performance since 2011. The economy’s recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis has been erratic. Weak data on consumer sentiment and factory activity in the Midwest on Friday suggested that while the economy has pulled out of its first-quarter soft patch, the growth pace was modest early in the second quarter. That mirrored other recent soft data on retail sales and industrial production. But reports on housing and business spending plans have indicated momentum could be building, which would keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates later this year. Economists caution against reading too much into the slump in output. They argue the GDP figure for the first quarter was held down by a confluence of temporary factors, including a problem with the model the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations. Economists, including those at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, have cast doubts on the accuracy of GDP estimates for the first quarter, which have tended to show weakness over the last several years. They argued the so-called seasonal adjustment is not fully stripping out seasonal patterns, leaving “residual” seasonality. The government said last week it was aware of the potential problem and was working to minimize it. “Obviously the economy is weaker than we would like it to be, but the first quarter overstates that,” said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica in Dallas. “We’re going see enough growth to keep job creation in place and allow the Fed to maintain their lift-off schedule for September.” When measured from the income side, the economy expanded at a 1.4 percent rate in the first quarter. A measure of domestic demand growth was revised up slightly and business spending on equipment was much stronger than previously estimated, taking some edge off the slump in output. U.S. Treasuries were trading higher, while the dollar was largely unchanged against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street fell. Apart from the statistical quirk, the economy, which expanded at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter, was hammered by a sharp decline in investment spending in the energy sector as companies such as Schlumberger and Halliburton  responded to the plunge in crude oil prices. Spending on mining exploration, shafts and wells plunged at a 48.6 percent pace in the first quarter, the largest drop since the second quarter of 2009. Economists estimate unusually heavy snowfalls in February chopped at least one percentage point from growth. Trade was hit both by the strong dollar and the ports labor dispute, which weighed on exports through the quarter and then unleashed a flood of imports in March after it was resolved. That resulted in a trade deficit that subtracted 1.90 percentage points from GDP, the largest drag in 31 years, instead of the 1.25 percentage points reported last month. The GDP report also showed after-tax corporate profits declined 8.7 percent. That was the largest drop in a year and the second quarterly fall, as the strong dollar burdened multinational corporations and oil prices hurt domestic firms. Multinationals like Microsoft Corp, household products maker Procter & Gamble Co and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year. Unlike 2014, when growth snapped back quickly after a dismal first quarter, the dollar and investment cuts by energy companies continue to hamstring activity. But growth could accelerate as the year progresses. The value of inventory accumulated in the first quarter was revised down to an increase of $95 billion from the lofty $110.3 billion rise reported last month. That meant inventories contributed 0.33 percentage point to GDP instead of the previously reported 0.74 percentage point, suggesting warehouses are not bulging with unwanted merchandise and businesses have latitude to order more goods from factories. While consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised down by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.8 percent rate, it could finally get a lift from the considerable savings households amassed because of cheaper gasoline. Personal savings increased at a robust $726.4 billion pace. “The outlook for the economy is very encouraging,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.

812,JNJ,Genmab shares rise on cancer drug's FDA licence application,"COPENHAGEN, June 8 (Reuters) - Shares in Genmab  rose almost 3 percent on Monday after partner Johnson and Johnson’s announcement late on Friday that the companies have applied to U.S. authorities for a licence to market their blood cancer drug daratumumab. The multiple myeloma treatment received breakthrough designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013, which SydBank analyst Soren Lontoft said could reduce the licence approval process to four months from the more usual six months. Breakthrough status is granted by the FDA when a drug shows significant improvement over available treatment of life-threatening illnesses. Friday’s statement said that the biologics licence application (BLA) would be supported mainly by Phase II study data, which is allowed for treatments given breakthrough status, and additional research can be submitted during the process. Analysts at Jyske Bank said on Monday that Phase II results presented to the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting on May 30 boosted their confidence in daratumumab’s potential. “We believe the presented Phase II results on daratumumab in multiple myeloma for patients who have run out of options were very encouraging,” the bank wrote in a research note.

813,JNJ,"WRAPUP 2-U.S. industrial output hurt by weakness in manufacturing, mining","(Adds details, housing data, updates markets) * Industrial production falls 0.2 percent in May * Manufacturing output slips 0.2 percent * Mining production drops 0.3 percent * New York state factory activity gauge falls in June By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, June 15 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial production unexpectedly fell in May as manufacturing and mining activity remained weak, a sign that a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector continued to constrain economic growth. The softness in the production side of the economy contrasts starkly with recent upbeat data on retail sales, employment, consumer and small business confidence, which have pointed to a growth pickup after a sluggish start to the second quarter. “Signs of spring remain largely absent in the industrial sector. The challenges of the stronger dollar and drop in energy  prices linger,” said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. Industrial output slipped 0.2 percent last month after declining 0.5 percent in April, the Federal Reserve said on Monday. Industrial production has been weak since December, and  economists had expected output to rise 0.2 percent last month. The data was likely to get the attention of Fed policymakers who meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, economists said. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise interest rates at this week’s policy meeting, but rather to wait until later this year. Industrial production last month was held down by a 0.2 percent drop in manufacturing output. Manufacturing has been whacked by a strong dollar, which has eroded the profits of multinational corporations. Companies like Microsoft Corp and Procter & Gamble Co, the world’s largest household products maker, and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year. The dollar has gained about 13.2 percent against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since last June largely on expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy. U.S. financial markets were little moved by Monday’s data as investors kept a wary eye on Greece, which inched closer to defaulting on its debt. U.S. stocks were trading lower, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government debt rose. Although motor vehicle production, machinery, and computer and electronic products increased last month, it was not enough to offset the drag on manufacturing output from declines in the production of electrical equipment, appliances and components, fabricated metal products and wood products. Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy and more than 72 percent of industrial production, was also weighed down by falling output of nondurable goods such as food and petroleum products. It is likely to remain weak in the months ahead. In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index dropped to a reading of minus 1.98 in June from 3.09 in May. That was the weakest reading since January 2013 and the second negative reading in the past three months. A gauge of new orders contracted, while shipments edged down. Though a measure of unfilled orders increased last month, it remained in contraction territory, indicating order books remained weak. “Manufacturers will continue to struggle with the impact of the dollar’s rise for some time yet,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. But given manufacturing’s small share of the economy and recent signs of a sharp pickup in growth in the non-factory sectors, Ashworth said “there is every reason to believe that GDP growth will average between 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent annualized over the rest of this year.” That upbeat assessment was bolstered by a third report showing confidence among homebuilders vaulted to an eight-month high in June, suggesting the housing market recovery was gaining traction. Housing is expected to take up some of the slack from weak manufacturing. GDP contracted in the first quarter, slammed by bad weather, port disruptions, dollar strength and energy sector spending cuts. Last month, mining production fell 0.3 percent, the fifth straight monthly decline, as oil and gas well drilling and servicing fell 7.9 percent after plunging 14.5 percent in April. That took the cumulative drop since the end of 2014 to 51.8 percent. But the pace of decline in oil and gas well drilling and servicing is moderating, suggesting the worst of the spending cuts is over. Companies like Schlumberger, the world’s No. 1 oilfield services provider, and Halliburton have slashed their capital spending budgets for this year. Oil and gas production, however, increased 0.5 percent in May. Unseasonably warm weather last month lifted demand for air conditioning, leading to a 0.2 percent increase in utilities production. The amount of industrial capacity in use last month fell to its lowest level since January 2014.

821,JNJ,J&J; sells popular Splenda sugar substitute to Heartland Food,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on Tuesday said it was selling its widely used Splenda sugar substitute to privately held Heartland Food Products Group in order to focus on other consumer brands. J&J; introduced Splenda in 1999, whose slogan “Made from sugar so it tastes like sugar,” helped it to grow into a brand with eventual annual sales of about $300 million and overtake sweeteners containing saccharin and aspartame. Splenda’s sweetening agent, called sucralose, is made from sugar that has been chemically altered to make it calorie free.   J&J; has been looking for a buyer for Splenda, which faces fierce competition from cheaper generic Chinese rivals, Reuters reported in December.  J&J; and Heartland, which did not disclose financial terms of the deal, said they expect it to close before the end of the year. J&J;, in a statement, said it was selling Splenda in order to focus on other healthcare categories, including baby care, skin care and products to treat pain and wounds.  British ingredients firm Tate & Lyle (TATE.L) makes sucralose and sells it to J&J;, which in turn markets it worldwide under the Splenda brand in familiar yellow packages used in homes and in restaurants.  Tate & Lyle also makes sucralose used in beverages and other retail products, unrelated to the company’s long-standing relationship with J&J; and Splenda. Chris Marsh, a spokesman for Tate & Lyle, said it was not yet clear whether his company would manufacture sucralose for Heartland, an Indiana company that makes low-calorie sweeteners as well as creamers and beverages. J&J; shares fell 2.25 percent to $90.73 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Tate & Lyle shares rose almost 0.9 percent in London.

823,JNJ,"J&J; starts vaccine trial in Sierra Leone, even as Ebola fades","(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson has begun a clinical trial of a two-shot Ebola vaccine in Sierra Leone, underlining its determination to push ahead with development, even as the epidemic fades out in West Africa. The new study will investigate the experimental product’s safety and its ability to provoke an immune response to the disease, which the World Health Organization says has killed more than 11,000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Last week, for the first time since the Ebola outbreak was declared in March 2014, there were no new confirmed cases of the deadly disease in those countries, according to the U.N. agency. Some survivors still suffer long-term effects from the virus, which can persist in parts of the body after clearing the blood, including a Scottish nurse taken ill in Sierra Leone last year who is now back in hospital for more treatment. The world already has one successful Ebola vaccine, with Merck and NewLink Genetics’ product proving 100-percent effective in a clinical study in Guinea in July. But scientists and drug companies are continuing to research the potential of alternatives, since different kinds of vaccines may be better suited for different population groups.  “Both regulators and governments around the world have encouraged us to continue,” Paul Stoffels, J&J;’s chief scientific officer, told Reuters. Campaign groups such as Medecins Sans Frontieres are also keen to see multiple manufacturers in order to have competition in the vaccine market to ensure lower prices and ample supply. J&J;, which is working with Bavarian Nordic in developing its vaccine, said on Friday that trial recruitment was underway in Sierra Leone and the first volunteers had received their initial vaccine dose.  This is the first study conducted of the so-called prime-boost vaccine regimen in a West African country affected by the recent Ebola epidemic. J&J;’s vaccine uses a combination of two components to strengthen the immunity and make it last longer. The U.S. healthcare company said it had scaled up production to more than 800,000 two-shot doses and had the capacity to produce 2 million if needed. Scientific experts believe the success of Merck and NewLink’s vaccine suggests other products in trials should also prove effective. Although these alternatives may not be tested in preventing Ebola cases, given the current lack of disease, they could still be licensed and readied for use in future outbreaks based on human immune response results and data from non-human primate experiments. GlaxoSmithKline is also working on an Ebola vaccine.

826,JNJ,J&J; says its diabetes drug should have same survival edge as Lilly's,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said the proven ability of Eli Lilly and Co’s (LLY.N) rival Jardiance diabetes drug to save lives in a large clinical trial is a benefit that will likely be seen in the entire class of drugs, including J&J;’s own approved Invokana treatment. Dominic Caruso, J&J;’s chief financial officer, on Tuesday gave his optimistic view of the new drug class, called SGLT2 inhibitors, during a conference call with industry analysts to discuss the company’s third-quarter earnings. Lilly last month said that a three-year study showed Jardiance slashed deaths by 32 percent in patients with type 2 diabetes at risk of heart attack and stroke - a finding that could make it a mainstay diabetes treatment. “We do think there’s a positive effect to the overall class as a result of the cardiovascular data that Lilly shared,” Caruso said. J&J; expects to learn whether Invokana also saves lives by 2017, when it completes its own large cardiovascular ‘outcomes’ trial, showing whether its pill also prevents fatal heart attacks and strokes. U.S. regulators require drugmakers to conduct large cardiovascular safety trials for diabetes drugs. The studies, which take years, are typically started long before the medicines are actually approved. The safety studies are also able to determine unexpected benefits of a medicine.  Global sales of Invokana almost doubled in the quarter to $340 million, making it by far the market leader and putting the new medicine on track to become a blockbuster product. Invokana in 2013 became the first approved member of the SGLT2 class in the United States, followed in 2014 by Jardiance and AstraZeneca Plc’s (AZN.L) Farxiga. The drug class works by increasing excretion of excess blood sugar from the kidneys. The drugs have also been associated with slight reductions in blood pressure and body weight, factors which researchers say could not have alone accounted for the surprisingly robust survival benefit seen in Jardiance’s large study. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May warned that SGLT2 inhibitors can cause a dangerous buildup of acid in the bloodstream, called ketoacidosis. Louise Mehrota, J&J;’s head of investor relations, said on the conference call that Invokana sales have grown sharply despite the FDA warning and that ketoacidosis had only been seen in about 0.1 percent of patients who took Invokana in late-stage trials.

833,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson's Stelara succeeds in Phase III Crohn's disease trial,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara was significantly better than placebo at inducing clinical response and remissions in patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease, according to data from a late stage trial, providing ammunition for a potential expanded approval of the medicine. Stelara, a biotech medicine that blocks inflammation, is approved to treat the skin condition scaly plaque psoriasis and a type of arthritis associated with psoriasis. J&J; reported $613 million in third-quarter Stelara sales. The company said it was on track for global approval filings for  Crohn’s this year.      Subjects in the 628-patient trial presented on Monday received either a single infusion of 130 milligrams of Stelara, a Stelara infusion of 6 mg per kilogram of weight or a placebo. After six weeks, 52 percent of those in the 130 mg group and 56 percent in the 6mg/kg group experienced a clinical response, defined as a reduction from baseline of at least 100 points in the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index score. That compared with 29 percent in the placebo group.  In addition, 31 percent of the Stelara 130 mg group and 40 percent in the other dosing arm achieved clinical remission by week 8 of the study, versus 20 percent for placebo. The results were deemed to be statistically significant. “I think this is an approvable drug,” said Dr. Brian Feagan, co-lead investigator of the study presented at the American College of Gastroenterology meeting in Honolulu.  “We need drugs that are alternatives to TNF blockers,” he said of widely used biologic medicines such as AbbVie’s Humira. “This drug can be a first-line biologic therapy.”  Patients in the study had previously failed to be helped by steroids or immunomodulator drugs, such as methotrexate. Another study is testing Stelara in those who failed anti-TNF therapy. Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract that affects about 700,000 Americans and  250,000 Europeans. Symptoms can include frequent diarrhea, abdominal pain and rectal bleeding.

834,JNJ,J&J;'s Stelara succeeds in Phase III Crohn's disease trial,"Oct 19 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara was significantly better than placebo at inducing clinical response and remissions in patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease, according to data from a late stage trial, providing ammunition for a potential expanded approval of the medicine. Stelara, a biotech medicine that blocks inflammation, is approved to treat the skin condition scaly plaque psoriasis and a type of arthritis associated with psoriasis. J&J; reported $613 million in third-quarter Stelara sales. The company said it was on track for global approval filings for  Crohn’s this year. Subjects in the 628-patient trial presented on Monday received either a single infusion of 130 milligrams of Stelara, a Stelara infusion of 6 mg per kilogram of weight or a placebo. After six weeks, 52 percent of those in the 130 mg group and 56 percent in the 6mg/kg group experienced a clinical response, defined as a reduction from baseline of at least 100 points in the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index score. That compared with 29 percent in the placebo group. In addition, 31 percent of the Stelara 130 mg group and 40 percent in the other dosing arm achieved clinical remission by week 8 of the study, versus 20 percent for placebo. The results were deemed to be statistically significant. “I think this is an approvable drug,” said Dr. Brian Feagan, co-lead investigator of the study presented at the American College of Gastroenterology meeting in Honolulu. “We need drugs that are alternatives to TNF blockers,” he said of widely used biologic medicines such as AbbVie’s  Humira. “This drug can be a first-line biologic therapy.” Patients in the study had previously failed to be helped by steroids or immunomodulator drugs, such as methotrexate. Another study is testing Stelara in those who failed anti-TNF therapy. Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract that affects about 700,000 Americans and  250,000 Europeans. Symptoms can include frequent diarrhea, abdominal pain and rectal bleeding. In addition to reductions in signs and symptoms of disease, Stelara patients reported significant improvements in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, a health-related quality of life measure, researchers said. The rate of serious side effects, including infections, was similar for Stelara and placebo. “Serious infection is really the thing that clinicians worry about and there was not a signal here, which is surprisingly great news,” Feagan said.

835,JNJ,FDA clears J&J;'s chemotherapy for certain soft tissue sarcomas,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Johnson & Johnson’s chemotherapy to treat specific soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) that have spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. The drug, Yondelis, is designed to delay the progression of cancer that occurs in fat cells called liposarcoma (LPS) or smooth muscle cells called leiomyosarcoma (LMS) - two rare and aggressive forms of cancer with limited treatment options. J&J; said that while the FDA approved Yondelis to treat both LPS and LMS, which account for about 35 percent of all STS cases, the drug is the first treatment to be specifically approved for LPS in the United States. Data showed Yondelis delayed the growth of a tumor by about 4.2 months on average. In contrast, dacarbazine, another form of chemotherapy, delayed the progression by an average of 1.5 months after initiating therapy. Yondelis, which won European approval in 2007, is FDA-approved for use in patients who have previously received treatment containing the chemotherapeutic agent anthracycline.

838,JNJ,Bi-monthly injection blocks HIV in study from J&J; and GSK,"(Reuters) - A long-acting two-drug injection given once every eight weeks worked as well as three daily pills in suppressing HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, according to a clinical trial backed by Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline. Paul Stoffels, J&J;’s head of pharmaceuticals, said the finding offered a potentially “transformational” way to fight HIV, if the result is confirmed in larger final-stage trials. He believes the combination could be on the market by 2020. The mix of J&J;’s rilpivirine and cabotegravir, from GSK’s HIV unit ViiV Healthcare, proved just as good as taking three daily pills at maintaining minimal viral levels in HIV-infected patients when given either monthly or every two months. Patients getting injections every month had viral suppression of 94 percent after 32 weeks, while the suppression rate was 95 percent for those receiving treatment every eight weeks. By comparison, patients on tablets had a suppression rate of 91 percent. During a research and development update for investors in New York on Tuesday, GSK said ViiV’s cabotegravir was one of the highlights of its new-drug pipeline.  GSK has a majority stake in ViiV, alongside minority holders Pfizer and Shionogi. A late-stage study of a second combination, J&J;’s rilpivirine and ViiV’s dolutegravir, has already begun.

841,JNJ,FDA approves J&J; drug for advanced multiple myeloma,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators have approved an experimental treatment from Johnson & Johnson that may offer hope to multiple myeloma patients who have run out of other options against the blood cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday said it had approved Darzalex (daratumumab) for patients who had already undergone at least three prior standard treatments for the cancer, which affects infection-fighting plasma cells that reside in the bone marrow.    Darzalex, given as an infusion, is a monoclonal antibody that works by helping the immune system attack cancer cells. J&J; licensed worldwide rights to the medicine from Danish biotech company Genmab A/S. In one 106-patient study, tumors shrank or were no longer detectable in 29 percent of patients taking Darzalex, and the benefit lasted for an average of 7.4 months. In a second trial, involving 42 patients, 36 percent of patients taking the J&J;/Genmab drug saw a partial or complete reduction in tumors. Researchers said it is the first antibody drug to demonstrate effectiveness against myeloma without having to be combined with other medicines. The most common side effects of the treatment included fatigue, nausea, back pain, fever and cough. An estimated 26,850 Americans are expected to be diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2015.  All patients eventually become resistant to existing therapies, which include Takeda’s Velcade and Celgene’s Revlimid, as well as newer drugs Kyprolis from Amgen and Celgene’s Pomalyst.

845,JNJ,"J&J;, Alphabet aim for smarter, smaller, cheaper surgical robot","(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson and Alphabet Inc’s life sciences unit have formed an independent company to create far smaller, smarter and less costly robotic-assisted systems for surgery than those sold now by other companies, J&J; said on Thursday. Creation of the new company, Verb Surgical Inc, follows an announcement in March by J&J; and Google Inc of their plans to pool their technologies and expertise to create robotics for the operating room. Google has since changed its name to Alphabet, and its life sciences unit is now called Verily. J&J;’s Ethicon division, world leader in equipment for general surgery, designed a basic prototype of the robot last year and expects it to be a “disruptive” alternative to existing products, Gary Pruden, global chairman of J&J;’s medical devices group, said in an interview.  Current robotic systems, including those sold by market leader Intuitive Surgical Inc, are the size of a compact car and require the surgeon to sit at a control panel about 10 feet from the patient, Pruden said. Verb’s robot will be about 20 percent the size, allow the surgeon to work closer to the patient and likely be considerably less expensive than current systems, which can cost $2 million or more, he said. And while robots today are used largely to remove cancerous prostate glands and in gynecological surgery, Verb’s system would be designed for wider use, including thoracic surgery, colorectal surgery and bariatric weight loss procedures, J&J; said. It would come loaded with technologies from Alphabet, including “machine learning,” in which the robot could analyze a video library of images from hundreds of previous surgeries in order to instruct the surgeon where to cut. Pruden said further development of Verb’s robot will take a few more years.  “Our goal is to have a lower-cost product, with the smallest footprint, with greater capability, that helps to raise the standard of care,” Pruden said. “That would be a market disruption.” Scott Huennekens, former chief executive of medical imaging company Volcano Corp, has been named CEO of Verb, which will be headquartered in Mountain View, California. Verily already has several projects in the works, including the development of a smart contact lens in partnership with  Swiss drugmaker Novartis that has an embedded glucose sensor. It would allow diabetics to monitor themselves continuously by measuring the blood sugar in their tears.

In a three-year study whose results were released last summer, Jardiance became the first diabetes therapy to show robust ability to reduce cardiovascular death.  Jardiance, which won U.S. approval last year, belongs to a new family of treatments called SGLT2 inhibitors that include Johnson & Johnson’s $1.3 billion-a-year Invokana and AstraZeneca Plc’s Farxiga. They flush excess blood sugar from the kidneys. Jardiance now accounts for 25 percent of new U.S. patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors, up from a 15 percent share before the Jardiance trial data were released in August, Lilly said on Tuesday.  In addition, use of sulfonylureas, a class of inexpensive generics that patients typically try before being moved to a costlier newer drug, has declined as Jardiance sales have taken off, Lilly said in a conference call describing its 2016 earnings expectations.     Johnson & Johnson was not immediately available for comment. The positive results of the trial have not yet been included in the drug’s label and it could take medical societies another year or longer to draft new treatment guidelines incorporating the data. “Once we get the label (change), we believe Jardiance will become the leader in the SGLT2 class,” Lilly diabetes head Enrique Conterno said in an interview on Tuesday. The details about Jardiance helped lift Lilly shares on Tuesday as much as 3 percent. There has been a push away from the sulfonylureas because of the risk of hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar, said Dr. Jason Gaglia of Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. Some insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have placed Jardiance ahead of Invokana on their lists of preferred covered treatments known as formularies, Gaglia said. Guggenheim Partners analyst Tony Butler said some payers have discouraged use of Jardiance, whose $4,000 annual cost greatly exceeds that of inexpensive generics that are mainstays of early treatment. But Butler said he expects them to relent once the label change is made and medical societies endorse the drug. Jardiance could generate annual sales of up to $5 billion, he said, with Lilly splitting profits with its partner, Boehringer Ingelheim of Germany.

851,JNJ,J&J; signs deal with Chinese company for hepatitis B drug,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Thursday said it licensed rights from a Chinese drugmaker to drugs that spur the immune system to help fight diseases, which it hopes will become a key part of a cure for chronic hepatitis B. The deal, with a unit of Sino Biopharmaceutical Ltd that focuses on treatments for liver diseases, gives J&J; exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and sell the medicines outside China. Unlike new hepatitis C drugs that boast extremely high cure rates and short treatment durations, current medicines for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) can hold it in check but must be taken for life. If untreated, the virus, which is spread by contact with infected bodily fluids, can be fatal and is a leading cause of liver cancer. Hepatitis B has been difficult to cure because antiviral medicines that block replication of the virus have proved insufficient at clearing it from the blood. J&J; and other researchers believe an assault by components of the immune system will be needed as part of a cure. The deal with Sino’s Chia Tai Tiaqing Pharmaceutical unit includes an immune-stimulating agent that could potentially be combined with antiviral drugs J&J; acquired when it purchased Novira Therapeutics in November. “With the Novira acquisition we have the lead direct antiviral in the world for HBV,” Lawrence Blatt, head of infectious diseases and vaccines for J&J;’s Janssen pharmaceutical unit, said in an interview.  “If we can in the same time we’re giving direct antivirals and blocking (virus) replication, activate the immune system and wake it up, maybe we can cause patients to clear HBV,” Blatt said.

852,JNJ,J&J; signs deal with Chinese company for hepatitis B drug,"Jan 7 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Thursday said it licensed rights from a Chinese drugmaker to drugs that spur the immune system to help fight diseases, which it hopes will become a key part of a cure for chronic hepatitis B. The deal, with a unit of Sino Biopharmaceutical Ltd  that focuses on treatments for liver diseases, gives J&J; exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and sell the medicines outside China. Unlike new hepatitis C drugs that boast extremely high cure rates and short treatment durations, current medicines for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) can hold it in check but must be taken for life. If untreated, the virus, which is spread by contact with infected bodily fluids, can be fatal and is a leading cause of liver cancer. Hepatitis B has been difficult to cure because antiviral medicines that block replication of the virus have proved insufficient at clearing it from the blood. J&J; and other researchers believe an assault by components of the immune system will be needed as part of a cure. The deal with Sino’s Chia Tai Tiaqing Pharmaceutical unit includes an immune-stimulating agent that could potentially be combined with antiviral drugs J&J; acquired when it purchased Novira Therapeutics in November. “With the Novira acquisition we have the lead direct antiviral in the world for HBV,” Lawrence Blatt, head of infectious diseases and vaccines for J&J;’s Janssen pharmaceutical unit, said in an interview. “If we can in the same time we’re giving direct antivirals and blocking (virus) replication, activate the immune system and wake it up, maybe we can cause patients to clear HBV,” Blatt said.

858,JNJ,"J&J; to cut 3,000 jobs in struggling device division","(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said on Tuesday it would cut about 3,000 jobs within its medical devices unit over the next two years, or about 4 to 6 percent of the struggling division’s global workforce, to generate annual cost savings of up to $1 billion and focus on more innovative products. The job cuts relate to J&J;’s orthopedics, surgery and cardiovascular operations, although there are no immediate plans to eliminate specific products, said company spokesman Ernie Knewitz. He did not provide specific regions for the cuts. “The savings will help us grow our (device) business,” Knewitz said. “That could involve acquisitions, but it will also involve investing in our own internal programs.”  The company's consumer medical devices, vision care and diabetes care will not be affected, J&J; said. (www.investor.jnj.com/MDFAQ) J&J;’s medical device sales approached $19 billion in the first nine months of 2015, but fell 10.4 percent, making the wide array of products its poorest-performing segment. The company expects pretax restructuring charges of $2.0 billion to $2.4 billion in connection with these plans, of which about $600 million will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. “It’s about realigning resources around priority platforms,” Gary Pruden, head of J&J;’s medical device unit, said in an interview. Pruden said J&J; is not satisfied with demand for its artificial knees, devices for trauma and some surgical products and wants to improve them with greater attention and resources. He said the company will “de-emphasize” other device areas, but declined to identify them. Leerink analysts said the announcement meant that an acquisition was still in the cards for J&J;, given that it had about $37 billion in cash as of the end of the third quarter. “We continue to believe JNJ is an active acquirer with a focus likely heavily weighted toward its lagging medical devices business,” they wrote in a note. J&J; also reiterated its full-year 2015 forecast, and said the restructuring in the devices business would not affect the $10 billion share repurchase program. The restructuring is expected to produce annualized pretax cost savings of $800 million to $1 billion, J&J; said. Most savings are expected by the end of 2018, including about $200 million in 2016. J&J; employs about 60,000 within its devices unit, representing almost half its global workforce of about 127,000. The company plans to report fourth-quarter results on Jan. 26.

859,JNJ,U.S. top court won't hear J&J; appeal of $140 million judgment,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court said on Tuesday it will not hear Johnson & Johnson’s appeal of a $140 million judgment in a lawsuit alleging it failed to warn that Children’s Motrin pain and fever medication could cause a devastating skin condition. The decision leaves intact one of the largest verdicts ever awarded by a Massachusetts jury. Johnson & Johnson and its McNeil-PPC Inc subsidiary had asked the high court to decide whether it should be held liable because they say federal drug regulators would not have approved adding warnings to the drug’s labels about the life-threatening condition suffered by the plaintiff, Samantha Reckis. J&J;’s petition had been closely watched by pharmaceutical industry trade groups. They had urged the court to hear the case in order to clarify what constitutes “clear evidence” that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would have rejected a label warning about the diseases at issue in the lawsuit. If regulators did not think a warning was necessary, they argued, companies should not be liable for failing to warn consumers about that risk. Reckis and her parents sued J&J; and McNeil in 2007, claiming they were not warned about the link between the active ingredient in Children’s Motrin, ibuprofen, and Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, two rare, related skin conditions. Reckis said she developed toxic epidermal necrolysis when she was 7 years old after receiving several doses of Children’s Motrin, leading her to lose 95 percent of the top layer of her skin and suffer other serious injuries, including heart failure, stroke and an aneurysm. A Massachusetts jury found J&J; and McNeil liable for failing to warn Reckis about those side effects and awarded her and her parents $63 million. With interest, the judgment totals $140 million. J&J; said the case should have been dismissed because the FDA had declined to grant a petition from several doctors and consumers seeking to add the names of those skin conditions to the warning label because they are unfamiliar to most consumers, and instead referenced potential redness, rash and blisters that are symptoms of those conditions. The company said this constituted “clear evidence” that such warnings were unnecessary. But the Massachusetts Supreme Court disagreed, saying the FDA’s past actions did not indicate how it would rule on proposed changes from J&J;, and affirmed the verdict last year. A J&J; spokeswoman said the company sympathized with the plaintiff but was disappointed with the high court’s decision not to hear the appeal. A lawyer for the Reckises, Michael Bogdanow, said they were grateful and relieved the Supreme Court had affirmed the judgment.",1192016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-court-johnsonjohnson/u-s-top-court-wont-hear-jj-appeal-of-140-million-judgment-idUSL2N15316O

866,JNJ,Investor pressures J&J; to consider split up: sources,"(Reuters) - Artisan Partners, a major shareholder in Johnson & Johnson, has urged several activists to pressure the consumer products giant to consider major changes that include a potential split, according to sources and documents.             Artisan has asked Johnson & Johnson’s management to consider separating its three divisions – consumer products, pharmaceuticals and medical devices – into standalone companies in hopes of unlocking up to $90 billion in enterprise value, said sources familiar with the matter.  Artisan, which manages nearly $100 billion, also suggested that Johnson & Johnson consider replacing board members, and reviewing standards for executive pay and financial reporting, documents seen by Reuters showed. In a presentation to Johnson & Johnson last year that was seen by Reuters, Artisan said the firm has significantly underperformed its peers across each of its major divisions, due partly to opaque financial reporting and flawed executive compensation.     It also said the company’s conglomerate structure has caused the it to trade at a substantial discount relative to more focused peers.          The heightened pressure on Johnson & Johnson comes as rival healthcare companies increasingly focus on a handful of areas of competitive advantage, while exiting other areas through divestitures or spin offs. Johnson & Johnson posted fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday that beat forecasts, but gave a 2016 revenue outlook that was below analysts’ estimates. The firm also said earlier in January that it was slashing 3,000 jobs in its struggling medical device division. A Johnson & Johnson spokesperson declined to comment, and referred to remarks that the firm made in an investor presentation on Tuesday.     “Because of our broad base across healthcare, we are uniquely positioned to be a partner of choice,” Alex Gorsky, chairman and chief executive officer of Johnson & Johnson, had said on Tuesday.  “This broad-based structure has helped us deliver strong, consistent and sustainable financial performance.”      In 2006, rival pharmaceutical giant Pfizer sold its consumer products division to Johnson & Johnson for $17 billion, becoming a focused play on drugs. Pfizer is now considering separating its patented drugs from its generics division.

875,JNJ,J&J; must pay $72 million for cancer death linked to talcum powder: lawyers,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) was ordered by a Missouri state jury to pay $72 million of damages to the family of a woman whose death from ovarian cancer was linked to her use of the company’s talc-based Baby Powder and Shower to Shower for several decades.  In a verdict announced late Monday night, jurors in the circuit court of St. Louis awarded the family of Jacqueline Fox $10 million of actual damages and $62 million of punitive damages, according to the family’s lawyers and court records.  The verdict is the first by a U.S. jury to award damages over the claims, the lawyers said.

About 1,000 cases have been filed in Missouri state court, and another 200 in New Jersey.  Fox, who lived in Birmingham, Alabama, claimed she used Baby Powder and Shower to Shower for feminine hygiene for more than 35 years before being diagnosed three years ago with ovarian cancer. She died in October at age 62.  Jurors found Johnson & Johnson liable for fraud, negligence and conspiracy, the family’s lawyers said. Deliberations lasted four hours, following a three-week trial.  Jere Beasley, a lawyer for Fox’s family, said Johnson & Johnson “knew as far back as the 1980s of the risk,” and yet resorted to “lying to the public, lying to the regulatory agencies.” He spoke on a conference call with journalists.  Carol Goodrich, a Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman, said: “We have no higher responsibility than the health and safety of consumers, and we are disappointed with the outcome of the trial. We sympathize with the plaintiff’s family but firmly believe the safety of cosmetic talc is supported by decades of scientific evidence.”  Trials in several other talc lawsuits have been set for later this year, according to Danielle Mason, who also represented Fox’s family at trial.

876,JNJ,Big verdict doesn't assure more wins for plaintiffs in talc-cancer cases,"NEW YORK(Reuters) - The $72 million verdict this week against Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in a U.S. case alleging links between talc-based powder and ovarian cancer has prompted global headlines, social media buzz and calls to lawyers from would-be plaintiffs. But the attention-grabbing judgment is no guarantee future plaintiffs will be able to convince juries the company’s products caused their illnesses. About 1,200 similar cases are pending, primarily in Missouri and New Jersey state courts, but the facts are different in every one. And even in cases with similar evidence and expert testimony, juries in mass personal-injury litigation can come to different conclusions.  While the survivors of Jacqueline Fox were awarded $72 million by a St. Louis jury Monday, jurors in a federal court action in South Dakota - the only other talc case to go to trial - found in 2013 that J&J; had been negligent but declined to award damages to plaintiff Deane Berg. Like Fox, Berg alleged her ovarian cancer was caused by her decades-long use of J&J;’s talc-powder products for feminine hygiene, and jurors in both cases heard testimony about studies linking talc to cancer risks.  But, unlike Fox, who passed away several months before the trial began, Berg was in remission at the time of the trial, according to court documents. In addition to factual differences among cases, venue can affect outcomes. Some state courts are considered more plaintiff-friendly than federal courts, which have stricter rules for the admission of evidence and expert testimony, said lawyers involved in the litigation.  One juror in the Missouri case, Jerome Kendrick, said in an interview with Reuters that he and other jurors were especially swayed by testimony from plaintiffs’ medical experts and  documents showing J&J; employees discussing talc powder’s possible cancer risk.  “The problem I had is that, according to inter office documents, J&J; was aware of the potential concerns,” Kendrick said. “And it really looked like instead of trying to investigate, they started talking about how to combat what would eventually be a court case.” J&J; has said that “decades of sound science” prove that talc is safe. The company on Tuesday issued a statement expressing sympathy for Fox’s family but disagreeing with the verdict. It also said it is exploring its post-trial options.  Talc litigation got its start in 2009, when Berg filed her lawsuit. The Fox lawsuit was selected by plaintiffs’ lawyers as the first to go to trial in Missouri, to serve as an early bellwether of how similar cases in that venue might fare. The litigation flew largely under the public’s radar until jurors returned the award for the family of Fox, who died in October at 62. The plaintiffs said Fox used J&J; Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder for feminine hygiene daily for 35 years before she was diagnosed three years ago with ovarian cancer.  It has resonated with the public far more than the Berg case, which “didn’t get headlines because they didn’t award any damages,” said R. Allen Smith, a Missouri-based lawyer who represented both the Fox family and Berg.  More cases may be filed soon, and lawyers at several plaintiffs’ firms who worked on the Fox case said they are investigating thousands of additional claims.  Still, the talc cases represent a relatively small portion  of the tens of thousands of lawsuits J&J; is facing over its many products. For instance, it is the target of more than 44,000 cases from women who say they were harmed by pelvic mesh devices made by its Ethicon unit, and more than 8,000 against its DePuy subsidiary regarding Pinnacle metal-on-metal hip systems.  The next J&J; talc trial is set for April in St. Louis, and additional trial dates have been set for later this year.  To be successful, plaintiffs must make both a general link between talc and ovarian cancer and show that J&J;’s products - as opposed to something else - are to blame for their cancer.  In spite of the increased interest in the litigation following the Fox verdict, attorney Danielle Mason of Beasley Allen, who was part of the team representing the Fox family at trial, said she expected J&J; to fight hard to defend itself in upcoming trials. “We’re in this for the long haul,” she said.

883,JNJ,J&J; loses bid to shut out marketing expert in Tylenol bellwether,"By Jessica Dye A federal judge in Pennsylvania has denied a request from Johnson & Johnson and its McNeil subsidiary to bar a marketing expert from testifying on behalf of the plaintiff in the first federal case slated for trial over claims that the popular over-the-counter painkiller Tylenol causes liver damage. On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Lawrence Stengel in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania said he would allow most of the proposed testimony from plaintiffs’ expert Dr. Marvin Goldberg about the marketing strategy for Tylenol and whether it adequately conveyed the severity of its possible side effects.

885,JNJ,J&J; hit with $500 mln verdict in hip implant trial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy unit were ordered by a Texas federal jury on Thursday to pay about $500 million to five plaintiffs who said they were injured by Pinnacle metal-on-metal hip implants. Following a two-month trial, jurors deliberated for a week before finding that the Pinnacle hips were defectively designed, and that the companies failed to warn the public about their risks. Jurors awarded about $140 million in total compensatory damages and about $360 million in punitive damages, said Mark Lanier, lead trial counsel for the plaintiffs. A J&J; spokeswoman said the company will appeal. John Beisner, a lawyer for the company, said he expected the verdict to be a “pyrrhic victory for plaintiffs’ counsel” that could be slashed significantly. Appeals courts often reduce massive personal-injury verdicts, and Texas law limits the amount of punitive damages that can be awarded to plaintiffs. Beisner estimated that punitive damages could be reduced to as little as $10 million. Lanier said plaintiffs would address the issue in post-trial proceedings. Lanier said the nine jurors returned a carefully considered verdict. “There are thousands of these cases, and J&J; needs to get responsible,” he added. The verdict came in the second federal trial involving the Pinnacle device. J&J; was cleared of liability in the first trial, which ended in 2014. Verdicts in these early trials are not binding on the rest of the litigation, but are used to help gauge the value of the remaining claims. More than 8,000 Pinnacle lawsuits have been consolidated in Texas federal court. All five plaintiffs are Texas residents who were implanted with metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip devices. They said design flaws caused the devices to fail more frequently and quickly than expected, leading to injuries including tissue death, bone erosion and high levels of metal in their blood. Plaintiffs said J&J; and DePuy described the metal-on-metal hips as long-lasting, durable and safe despite being aware of the risks, and aggressively promoted them for use in younger, more active patients.

888,JNJ,RPT-UPDATE 1-J&J; psoriasis drug Stelara eases Crohn's disease in second trial,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara psoriasis drug has shown effectiveness against Crohn’s disease in a second late-stage trial, the company said on Friday, bolstering prospects of its approval for the additional use.  The Phase 3 study showed Stelara induced remissions in moderate to severe Crohn’s disease patients who had previously failed to benefit from TNF inhibitors, a leading class of medicines for the inflammatory bowel disease. Those treatments include J&J;’s own Remicade and AbbVie Inc’s Humira. J&J; presented the favorable data on Friday at the 11th Congress of the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organization in Amsterdam. In October, the company said Stelara was significantly more effective than placebo in another study of patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s symptoms.  Stelara is now awaiting U.S. approval as a treatment for the condition, based on results of that earlier trial.  The drug, which works by blocking two inflammation-causing proteins called IL-12 and IL-23, is one of J&J;’s biggest, with sales last year of almost $2.5 billion. It is approved in the United States for adults with moderate to severe psoriasis, an inflammatory skin condition caused by an overactive immune system. Crohn’s is a chronic inflammatory condition in the gastrointestinal tract, causing abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss and fever. It affects about 700,000 Americans and nearly 250,000 Europeans, J&J; said. Patients in the 741-patient study received either of two intravenous doses of Stelara, or of a placebo. After six weeks, 34 percent of patients receiving either Stelara dose achieved a target reduction in Crohn’s symptoms, compared with 22 percent of those taking a placebo. Similar incidence of side effects and infections were seen in the Stelara and placebo patient groups, J&J; said. Researchers at the meeting said other studies were under way to show whether Stelara can maintain control of Crohn’s symptoms over extended periods.

899,JNJ,"Investors find safety in J&J; shares, but run could stall","NEW YORK (Reuters) - After lagging a six-year healthcare sector run fueled by fast-growing biotech companies, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) shares have beaten the group in 2016 as investors turn to safety in rocky equity markets. But with the stock price now hovering near its $110.35 record high, that strategy may be in doubt. J&J; shares already have risen to the level that the average analyst has targeted for them, and sell at a healthy premium to large pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer (PFE.N) and Merck (MRK.N). Relative to their own future earnings, the shares are more expensive than they have been in more than a year. “What I am more concerned at this juncture is, do we see more follow-through or do we see profit taking?” said Arthur Henderson, portfolio manager of the global healthcare equity fund at the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System, where he has recently sold some J&J; shares so they account for a smaller part of the fund’s holdings. J&J; shares could build on their gains if investors rekindle worries about the broader economy or continue to hide from concerns facing the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, and some analysts are optimistic about the company’s pipeline of experimental medicines. But, ultimately, the company will have to produce enough earnings growth to justify the higher prices. On that front, the company faces a fresh competitive threat to its biggest drug franchise. U.S. regulators earlier this month approved a rival version of the company’s Remicade treatment for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. J&J;’s first-quarter report, due on April 19, is expected to show earnings up 6 percent over the same quarter a year ago, on a 0.6 percent increase in sales, according to Thomson Reuters data. Wall Street analysts are predicting fairly consistent annual earnings growth between 5 percent to 6 percent over the next few years. In January, the company projected that its calendar year 2016 profits would ultimately be up 5 percent to 8 percent over 2015 and it would aim to significantly increase its operating margins. “Most pharmaceutical companies have cut fat over the past years and my sense is what it implies is they can cut some extra fat,” said Tony Butler, analyst at Guggenheim Securities. J&J;’s product diversity makes it more immune than other drug stocks to political pressures on the cost of medicines. The company’s pharmaceutical unit accounted for 45 percent of its $70 billion in sales last year, with medical devices totaling more than a third and over-the-counter medicines and other consumer products making up the rest. The shares are up 7 percent in 2016 against a 3-percent decline for the S&P; healthcare sector .SPXHC. The company’s shares had underperformed the sector every year dating back to 2009 as J&J; also grappled with a slew of product recalls and manufacturing setbacks for its consumer division. At 16.6 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, the stock is still slightly cheaper than the valuation for the overall S&P; 500 .SPX. Investors also are drawn to J&J;’s 2.7-percent dividend yield, which nonetheless lags Merck and Pfizer, which both yield more than 3 percent. “People right now are paying up quite a bit for that safety piece of it,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover, who puts fair value for the shares at $102. “I think it’s overvalued, but I do think there are characteristics in the economy and political landscape that bode well for J&J.;” ",4142016,http://www.reuters.com/article/johnsonjohnson-stock/investors-find-safety-in-jj-shares-but-run-could-stall-idUSL2N17E10R

The company also said on Tuesday that it remained on track to boost profit margins significantly this year, in part from cost cuts.  In a possibly encouraging signal for other drugmakers that will be reporting results in coming weeks, J&J; said the strong dollar took a 3.3 percent bite out of global sales in the first quarter - half the impact in the prior period -  as the currency’s value eased somewhat. J&J; shares rose as much as 2.7 percent to an all-time high of $113.95. The ARCA Pharmaceutical Index .DRG of large drugmakers was up 0.6 percent, outpacing slight gains for the broad stock market.   Until this year, J&J; shares had underperformed the healthcare sector every year since 2009 as the company grappled with patent expirations on important drugs and a slew of product recalls and manufacturing setbacks for its consumer division. But J&J; has recently introduced a number of fast-growing medicines. Pharmaceutical sales rose 5.9 percent to $8.2 billion in the first quarter, with increased demand for the Imbruvica cancer drug and Invokana diabetes treatment. Sales of Remicade, J&J;’s biggest product, jumped 11.2 percent to $1.78 billion. But investors have been concerned it could be hurt by Inflectra, a cheaper version developed by South Korea’s Celltrion Inc 068270.KQ in partnership with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). U.S. regulators approved Inflectra earlier this month, but a continuing patent battle between J&J; and Celltrion has delayed its introduction.  J&J; Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said on Tuesday that strong patents should shield Remicade from biosimilar competition in 2016 and potentially for years to come. The company is upgrading plants that make its consumer medicines, including Tylenol, to address longstanding quality control problems.  J&J; is also restructuring its struggling medical device business to focus on areas like artificial knees and devices for trauma surgery. Medical device sales slipped 2.4 percent to $6.1 billion in the quarter, while sales of consumer products fell 5.8 percent to $3.2 billion.  Total sales rose 0.6 percent to $17.48 billion, matching the analysts’ average estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net earnings fell to $4.29 billion, or $1.54 per share, from $4.32 billion, or $1.53 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, J&J; earned $1.68 per share, topping Wall Street expectations of $1.65. “Overall it was a pretty solid quarter, with J&J; beating earnings estimates and delivering on sales,” said Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans.   J&J; said that based on current exchange rates, it expected sales of $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion in 2016, up from its January forecast of $70.8 billion to $71.5 billion. It raised its earnings outlook to between $6.53 and $6.68 a share from a prior range of $6.43 to $6.58.

U.S. regulators approved Inflectra earlier this month, but a continuing patent battle between J&J; and Celltrion has delayed its introduction.  J&J; Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said on Tuesday that strong patents should shield Remicade from biosimilar competition in 2016 and potentially for years to come. The company is upgrading plants that make its consumer medicines, including Tylenol, to address longstanding quality control problems.  J&J; is also restructuring its struggling medical device business to focus on areas like artificial knees and devices for trauma surgery. Medical device sales slipped 2.4 percent to $6.1 billion in the quarter, while sales of consumer products fell 5.8 percent to $3.2 billion.  Total sales rose 0.6 percent to $17.48 billion, matching the analysts’ average estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net earnings fell to $4.29 billion, or $1.54 per share, from $4.32 billion, or $1.53 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, J&J; earned $1.68 per share, topping Wall Street expectations of $1.65. “Overall it was a pretty solid quarter, with J&J; beating earnings estimates and delivering on sales,” said Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans.   J&J; said that based on current exchange rates, it expected sales of $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion in 2016, up from its January forecast of $70.8 billion to $71.5 billion. It raised its earnings outlook to between $6.53 and $6.68 a share from a prior range of $6.43 to $6.58.

903,JNJ,J&J; Pinnacle plaintiffs fight for full $360 mln punitive-damage award,"April 22 - Five plaintiffs suing Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy unit over Pinnacle hip implants have asked a federal judge in Texas to let them collect the full $360 million in punitive damages they were awarded last month, calling a state cap that could reduce it to less than $10 million unconstitutional. In a brief filed Thursday, lawyers for the five plaintiffs asked U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in the Northern District of Texas to ignore the cap because it is based on a formula that takes into account the economic damages awarded to plaintiffs for things such as lost earning potential.

905,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson ordered to pay $55 mln in talc-powder trial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) was ordered by a U.S. jury on Monday to pay $55 million to a woman who said that using the company’s talc-powder products for feminine hygiene caused her to develop ovarian cancer. The verdict, which J&J; plans to appeal, was the second straight trial loss for the company, which is facing about 1,200 lawsuits accusing it of not adequately warning consumers about its talc-based products’ cancer risks.  Following a three-week trial in Missouri state court, jurors deliberated for about a day before returning a verdict for Gloria Ristesund. She was awarded $5 million in compensatory damages and $50 million in punitive damages.  J&J; spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said the verdict contradicted 30 years of research supporting the safety of cosmetic talc. The company intends to appeal and will keep defending its products’ safety, she said. Ristesund said she used J&J;’s talc-based powder products – which include the well-known Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder – on her genitals for decades. According to her lawyers, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a hysterectomy and related surgeries. Her cancer is now in remission. Jere Beasley, whose firm represents Ristesund, said his client was gratified with the verdict. The jury’s decision should “end the litigation” and compel J&J; to settle the remaining cases, he said. J&J; shares were down 18 cents in after-hours trading to $112.57. The verdict followed a $72 million jury award from the same court in February to the family of a woman who died from ovarian cancer after years of using talc powder for feminine hygiene. That verdict, which J&J; is appealing, sparked renewed interest in talc-powder lawsuits among plaintiffs’ lawyers, as well as consumers familiar with J&J;’s powder products. But scientists have told Reuters the evidence of a real danger is inconclusive. Plaintiffs in talc litigation, which is concentrated in Missouri and New Jersey state courts, have accused J&J; of failing for years to warn that talc was linked to an increased risk for ovarian cancer. J&J; has said it acted properly in developing and marketing the products.  The only other case to be tried involving talc powder and ovarian cancer resulted in a mixed verdict in South Dakota federal court in 2013. While those jurors found J&J; was negligent, they awarded no damages to the plaintiff, whose cancer was in remission at the time of the trial.  Reuters viewed the proceedings on Courtroom View Network.

906,JNJ,Talc-powder lawsuit advertising jumps after back-to-back verdicts,"Spending on advertising targeting women who may have claims involving Johnson & Johnson’s talc-powder products and ovarian cancer has skyrocketed in the wake of two multimillion-dollar plaintiffs’ verdicts this year, according to data from X Ante, which tracks mass-tort marketing. In February, just before jurors in state court in St. Louis, Missouri awarded $72 million to the family of Jacqueline Fox - whose lawsuit claimed J&J; failed to warn about the risks that using talc powder for feminine hygiene can cause ovarian cancer - plaintiffs’ firms and other mass-tort advertisers spent just $16,000 to air 96 television ads about talc powder and ovarian cancer. The next month, spending had jumped to more than $865,000 for 1,400 ads, according to data about television advertising provided to Reuters by X Ante.

907,JNJ,Fitch Rates Johnson & Johnson's Euro Notes Offering 'AAA'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'AAA' rating to Johnson &  Johnson's (JNJ) euro notes offering. The Rating Outlook is Stable. JNJ intends  to use the net proceeds from the issuance for share repurchases, debt reduction  and general corporate purposes. A complete list of JNJ's ratings follows at the  end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The company's 'AAA' rating reflects the following: --JNJ continues to generate strong operational and financial performance,  despite select near-term headwinds. --Biosimilar competition for Remicade in Europe, potential U.S. biosimilar  competition for Remicade in late-2016/early-2017 and adverse foreign exchange  movement will weigh on revenues during 2016, but the company's operating and  financial trends remain positive. --Fitch expects that JNJ will maintain a commitment to deploying cash for  acquisitions, collaborations and internal investment opportunities that it  believes will support long-term profitable growth. --Fitch believes JNJ will operate with leverage consistent with its 'AAA' rating  and with solid liquidity supported by significant cash balances and ample access  to credit markets. Growth Despite Headwinds: Fitch expects that JNJ will continue to generate  moderate intermediate-term top-line growth, despite facing a number of  challenges during 2016 and beyond. The company continues to bring innovative new  products to market and expand the utilization of established products and  franchises. Nevertheless, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and competition in  select franchises will likely dampen reported sales growth during 2016. Remicade  faced biosimilar competition in Europe during 2015, which modestly reduced  year-over-year sales in those affected countries. Fitch expects this trend to  continue during at least the four-year forecast period. In addition, biosimilars  could challenge Remicade in the U.S. as early as late-2016/early-2017. Innovation-Driven Long-Term Organic Growth: JNJ pursues innovation across all  three of its business segments, which provides it with favorable long-term  growth prospects, as well as opportunities to support margins. Research and  development (R&D;) intensity is greatest in its biopharmaceutical business,  followed by the medical device segment. The company also pursues collaborations  and outright acquisitions to supplement its internal new product development  efforts. This strategy has produced a significant number of innovative,  value-added medical therapies and products. While the consumer business is not  as R&D; intensive, innovation is still a key component in defending and advancing  JNJ's franchises in this segment. Broad Portfolio Mitigates Risk: JNJ operates with three business segments and a  large diversified product portfolio, reducing its operational and financial  reliance on any individual product. It employs a decentralized business model  with its various franchises to promote receptivity to their respective markets,  while maintaining a strong cultural-centric philosophy driven by its  longstanding credo. The company develops and manufactures consumer  healthcare-related products, medical devices and pharmaceutical/biologic  therapies. Its diverse business model also enables JNJ to pursue a broad array  of treatment advancements that offer growth opportunities. JNJ's largest selling product, Remicade, accounts for roughly 9.6% of sales. It  is also a biologic, which typically faces patent slopes as opposed to patent  cliffs like traditional, small-molecule drugs. This dynamic mitigates the risk  of generic/biosimilar competition. The next three largest products, in total,  account for less than 10% of company sales. In addition, Fitch views the  company's patent expiration risk as manageable. Free Cash Flow (FCF) for Growth and Shareholder Returns: Fitch anticipates that  JNJ will produce strong annual FCF during the forecast period of $6 billion -  $6.5 billion. Moderately improving margins, aided by an improving sales mix and  a continued focus on costs should support solid FCF, despite near-term  operational challenges.  JNJ will likely remain acquisitive, focusing on targets or products that offer  innovation and growth in the health care sector. Fitch expects the company to  finance its transactions within the context of its 'AAA' credit profile.  Shareholder-focused activities, such as dividend increases and share repurchases  will likely continue, and Fitch believes the company will largely finance these  with FCF. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for JNJ's 'AAA' rating include  the following: --Low-single-digit revenue growth in 2016 and 2017, improving incrementally in  the following three years. --Margin improvement driven by favorable product mix and an ongoing focus on  cost control during the intermediate term. --Annual FCF of $6 billion - $6.5 billion during 2016 and 2017.  --Leverage to range between 0.7x and 0.9x with moderately increasing levels of  debt.  --Capital deployment priorities balanced between acquisitions and share  repurchases, with the mix depending on the availability and valuation of  strategically appropriate targets. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not anticipate a downgrade during its four-year forecast  horizon, a negative rating action could occur because of some combination of a  deteriorating operating performance and leveraging transactions. Fitch believes  the company's broadly diversified healthcare-related franchises make it more  likely that a negative rating action would be prompted by a leveraging  transaction, as opposed to operational stress. Three key rating metrics for JNJ's 'AAA' rating are the following:  --Total debt/FCF of 3.0x gives no flexibility (reported Jan. 3, 2016 at 2.5x); --Total debt/EBITDA of 1.0x gives no flexibility (reported Jan. 3, 2016 at  0.84x); --Net debt of $4 billion - $5 billion gives no flexibility (reported Jan. 3,  2016 at a net cash position of $19.1 billion). LIQUIDITY Solid Liquidity: JNJ has significant liquidity and access to the credit markets.  Moderate growth and relatively stable margins enabled the company to generate  $7.6 billion of FCF during the LTM period ended Jan. 3, 2016. JNJ had  approximately $38.4 billion in cash plus short-term marketable securities and  access to $10 billion in short-term borrowings on Jan. 3, 2016.  Debt Structure: JNJ had approximately $19.3 billion in debt, including $4.6  billion in short-term debt on Jan. 3, 2016, with approximately $2.4 billion of  long-term debt maturing in 2016, $1.8 billion in 2017 and $1.5 billion in 2018.  Fitch expects that the company will refinance the vast majority of its upcoming  maturities.

909,JNJ,J&J; to stand behind talc's safety at upcoming trials: lawyer,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson will keep arguing in court that its talc-based powders are safe, an outside lawyer who has defended the company in lawsuits said, even after losing two multimillion-dollar verdicts to plaintiffs who alleged that J&J; Baby Powder and Shower to Shower caused ovarian cancer. Gene Williams blamed those verdicts on confusion created by plaintiffs’ lawyers at the trial. The Houston-based lawyer insisted in a recent interview that there “is no proven linkage between talc and ovarian cancer, and the vast majority of scientific and regulatory bodies, who have reviewed the same studies the plaintiffs point to, do not accept the premise.” Two talc lawsuits are scheduled for trial this fall, one in Missouri and one in New Jersey. At least 1,400 cases have been filed over the issue, mostly in Missouri, where state court rules are seen as friendly to plaintiffs. Three cases on the issue have gone to trial in which plaintiffs pointed to studies dating back three decades, saying they show talc use on the genitals can raise women’s ovarian cancer risk between 30 and 60 percent. J&J; said subsequent larger, more comprehensive studies found no conclusive link between the product and cancer. “The science supporting the safety of talc has gotten stronger and stronger,” Williams said. In February, a jury in St. Louis, Missouri, awarded $72 million to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer from using J&J;’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products for feminine hygiene. Another jury, before the same St. Louis judge, returned a $55 million award in a similar case. J&J; has said it will appeal both awards.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals acquired Shower to Shower from J&J; by in 2012.  An earlier trial in South Dakota ended in 2013 with the jury finding J&J; had been negligent but declining to award damages. Neither side appealed the South Dakota case. Following the Ristesund verdict, plaintiffs’ lawyer Jere Beasely, whose firm Beasley Allen has been one of the most active in filing talc lawsuits, issued a statement calling for J&J; to establish a compensation fund to settle the remaining talc cases.  Asked whether J&J; would consider settling, company spokeswoman Carol Goodrich said it was preparing for the upcoming trials this fall.  Williams, a partner at Shook, Hardy & Bacon, has represented J&J; in all three talc lawsuits that have gone to trial. He mainly defends medical drug and device companies, including Eli Lilly and Co and Bristol Myers Squibb.

913,JNJ,California sues Johnson & Johnson over marketing for pelvic mesh,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - California has accused Johnson & Johnson of failing to warn doctors and patients about the severity and frequency of complications associated with its pelvic mesh devices. According to the lawsuit filed by the state’s attorney general on Tuesday, J&J; and its Ethicon unit falsely marketed the devices as a safe and superior option to non-mesh treatments for pelvic floor disorders, when it was aware that they could cause pain, bleeding, loss of sexual function and other side effects. “Johnson & Johnson put millions of women at risk of severe health problems by failing to provide critical information to doctors and patients about its surgical mesh products,” California Attorney General Kamala Harris said in a statement. Her office led a multi-state investigation into J&J;’s mesh products, which included 46 states and the District of Columbia. The lawsuit seeks monetary penalties and an order halting any unfair advertising for mesh. J&J; said in a statement that the lawsuit was “unjustified” and could discourage women from seeking treatment for incontinence symptoms. “The evidence will show that Ethicon acted appropriately and responsibly in the marketing of our pelvic mesh products,” said spokeswoman Samantha Lucas. J&J; is one of several manufacturers that sold the devices to treat conditions like stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse in women. Those companies are facing tens of thousands of individual lawsuits from plaintiffs who said they were injured by the mesh’s poor design and substandard materials, which plaintiffs say led to serious complications that require surgery to repair. According to California’s attorney general, J&J; sold more than 787,000 pelvic mesh devices in the United States from 2008 until 2014, including more than 42,000 in California. Also on Tuesday, Washington state’s attorney general, Bob Ferguson, filed a similar consumer-protection lawsuit against J&J; over its marketing of pelvic mesh devices. Over the past several years, the devices have come under increasing scrutiny by regulators as well as private litigants. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says it has received thousands of reports of complications in connection with mesh used to treat pelvic organ prolapse. Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration said it was reclassifying mesh used to treat pelvic organ prolapse transvaginally from class II, or moderate risk, to class III, for high-risk devices, which will require manufacturers to submit extensive data to establish the devices’ safety.

According to California’s attorney general, J&J; sold more than 787,000 pelvic mesh devices in the United States from 2008 until 2014, including more than 42,000 in California.  Also on Tuesday, Washington state’s attorney general, Bob Ferguson, filed a similar consumer-protection lawsuit against J&J; over its marketing of pelvic mesh devices.  Over the past several years, the devices have come under increasing scrutiny by regulators as well as private litigants. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says it has received thousands of reports of complications in connection with mesh used to treat pelvic organ prolapse.  Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration said it was reclassifying mesh used to treat pelvic organ prolapse transvaginally from class II, or moderate risk, to class III, for high-risk devices, which will require manufacturers to submit extensive data to establish the devices’ safety.

921,JNJ,"J&J; myeloma drug, in combo regimen, delays worsening of the disease","(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s therapy for advanced multiple myeloma sharply reduced the risk of disease progression when taken with two standard treatments for the blood cancer, according to research the company hopes will pave the way for wider use of the treatment. The drug, Darzalex, received U.S. approval in November for use by itself among patients who had received at least three prior treatments for myeloma, a cancer of infection-fighting white blood cells.  Data from a late-stage trial involving 498 patients who had previously undergone one or more myeloma treatments was released on Sunday. In the study, one group received Takeda Pharmaceutical Co’s Velcade and the steroid dexamethasone, while the other group received Darzalex in combination with those two drugs.  After more than seven months, 61 percent fewer patients taking the Darzalex combination experienced a worsening of their disease compared with those taking the standard two-drug regimen, meeting the trial’s main goal. The median time to progression of disease has not yet been reached for the Darzalex group, compared with 7.2 months for patients taking the two-drug combo. The study was stopped in March after an independent data monitoring committee found the Darzalex regimen showed a statistically significant benefit. Some 19 percent of patients in the Darzalex group showed no further sign of disease, versus 9 percent of those taking  Velcade and dexamethasone. Significant disease reduction was seen in 83 percent taking the Darzalex regimen, versus 63 percent in the two-drug combination. The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in Chicago. The infused medicine, which has a list price of $135,000 for the first full year of treatment, blocks the CD38 protein found on myeloma cells. It was approved based on favorable data from two smaller trials, including a study in which tumors shrank in 29 percent of patients. Dr. Antonio Palumbo, the study’s lead researcher, said in an interview that overall toxicity in the Darzalex regimen was similar to that seen with the two standard treatments. That may help the J&J; drug become a second-line treatment, in combination with Velcade and dexamethasone, he said. The most common side effects for both drug combinations included low blood platelets, diarrhea and anemia.   Palumbo, melanoma unit chief at the University of Torino, Italy, said data from another late-stage study of Darzalex is expected later this month and will probably mirror strong results seen in his own study. In that trial, patients received Darzalex in combination with Celgene Corp’s leading Revlimid (lenalidomide) treatment and with dexamethasone. Mark Wildgust, global head of hematology at J&J;, said the company hopes the trial results will allow it to market Darzalex as an earlier treatment, and in combination with standard medicines. The National Cancer Institute estimates there are 26,850 new cases of multiple myeloma each year in the United States. The average life expectancy is four years.

928,JNJ,J&J;'s Janssen hit with $70 million verdict in Risperdal trial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. jury on Friday awarded $70 million to the family of a boy who developed breasts after taking Johnson & Johnson unit Janssen Pharmaceuticals’ antipsychotic drug Risperdal. The jury in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas found that the company failed to warn the boy’s healthcare providers about the risk of gynecomastia, which is breast growth in men or boys caused by a hormonal imbalance, and that it intentionally falsified, destroyed or concealed evidence in the case, according to a copy of the verdict form provided by a spokesman for the law firm Arnold & Itkin. Andrew Yount, of Tennessee, developed gynecomastia at the age of five as a result of taking Risperdal, his lawyers say. Yount’s case is one of many similar cases consolidated in the Philadelphia court. Several others have resulted in jury verdicts, but Friday’s verdict dwarfs the next largest of $2.5 million. Other cases are also expected to go to trial, Yount’s attorney, Jason Itkin, said in his statement. Johnson & Johnson and Janssen are facing more than 12,000 claims over Risperdal, according to Johnson & Johnson’s most recent quarterly report. Janssen spokeswoman Kristina Chang said in an emailed statement that the verdict was “clearly excessive” and that the company would ask the court and, if necessary, an appeals court to review it. Risperdal was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002 to treat schizophrenia, but was not cleared for use in children until 2006. In 2013, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen paid more than $2.2 billion to resolve civil and criminal investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice into its marketing of Risperdal and several other drugs. Prosecutors said that from 1999 to 2005, Janssen promoted Risperdal for uses not approved by the FDA, including behavioral disturbances in elderly people with dementia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism in children, despite knowing of its risks.

935,JNJ,Medtech's 2016 stock surge confronts second-quarter test,"NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - Shares of many U.S. companies that produce prescription medicines have been under pressure this year, but the picture has been rosier for makers of pacemakers, knee replacements and other medical devices. While biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies endure scrutiny over drug costs, medical device companies have avoided that glare. Their sterling first-quarter results have also helped draw investors seeking safety in healthcare. The stocks have risen enough that they now look relatively expensive, trading as a group at 19 times the next 12 months earnings estimates compared to a five-year average of 15.8 times. But drug prices could remain an issue through the U.S. presidential election in November, and some investors say medical device companies will keep their appeal if they report solid second-quarter revenue and profits this month. “You still don’t know how nasty this is going to get on the campaign trail,” said Teresa McRoberts, portfolio manager at Fred Alger Management in New York. “There are times when things trade at premiums for reasons beyond fundamentals, and right now one of them is the headline risk that I think is going to keep medtech doing OK.” This year, the S&P; 500 Health Care Equipment index  has surged about 15 percent, trouncing the roughly 1.5 percent rise for the overall S&P; 500 healthcare sector . The eight best-performing stocks in the broader S&P; healthcare index in 2016 are medical device companies, including orthopedics company Stryker, heart device makers Edwards Lifesciences and Boston Scientific, and diversified manufacturer C R Bard. Large medical device companies on average posted organic first-quarter revenue growth of 4.8 percent from a year earlier, their best result in at least two years, Barclays analysts said in a recent report. Since then, executives have been generally positive about U.S. volume trends, the Barclays analysts said. Bihag Patel, senior research analyst at Nuveen Asset Management in Minneapolis, said if the companies can sustain mid-single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, the stocks should maintain their positive momentum. Intuitive Surgical kicks off reporting season for medical device companies on July 19, followed by Abbott Laboratories on July 20 and Stryker on July 21. “It’s a group that’s in favor right now, and if you want to be exposed to healthcare it’s very safe right now,” Patel said. Biotech and pharmaceutical shares face heightened risks from criticism over pricing. Last fall, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton shook the market with a tweet about “price gouging.” The approaching Republican and Democratic conventions could put more pressure on the shares, McRoberts said. “I don’t know if good earnings even get rewarded if it’s right around when you see whatever verbiage comes out of the convention,” McRoberts said. In medtech, Nuveen’s Patel said he liked several cardiovascular device makers including Boston Scientific. He also said shares of orthopedics company Zimmer Biomet Holdings  are relatively cheap. Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds, in Rye, New York, favors Abbott, whose shares have lagged this year. But Jonas has been selling some holdings in Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson, which have run up. “I think there are still pockets of value out there but broadly speaking the sector is expensive,” said Jonas. Another hazard for medtech, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro, would be if investors look more favorably at biotech stocks, fueled by exciting clinical data for experimental medicines or by more large-scale acquisitions of biotech companies, similar to Sanofi’s recent bid for Medivation. “The number one risk to medtech stock performance really is a rotation back into biotech,” Novarro said.

938,JNJ,TPG to acquire surgical tools maker Beaver-Visitec,"(Reuters) - TPG Capital LP, one of the world’s largest private equity firms, has agreed to acquire Beaver-Visitec International, a U.S. maker of tools used in eye surgery, from buyout firm RoundTable Capital Partners. The acquisition, the value of which was not disclosed, provides TPG with a platform that it can use to rapidly scale up its presence in the ophthalmology space.  Beaver-Visitec was created by RoundTable in 2010 through a combination of the opthalmic product businesses of three separate companies: Becton Dickinson and Co (BDX.N), Medtronic (MDT.N) and Aspen Surgical.  Since then, RoundTable has built out Beaver-Visitec through multiple small acquisitions. In recent years, TPG Capital has exited businesses in several other healthcare-related areas. In 2015, TPG sold Par Pharmaceutical Holdings, a purveyor of generic drugs, to Endo International Plc (ENDP.O) for $8 billion. The same year, TPG sold Envision Pharmaceutical Services, a pharmaceutical benefits manager, to pharmacy Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) for $2 billion.  In 2013, TPG launched a nearly $1 billion initial public offering of Quintiles Transnational Holdings, a contract research organization.  Quintiles recently merged with healthcare data and analytics company IMS Health IMS.N. In buying Beaver-Visitec, TPG is entering a sector with a number of well established strategic competitors. Some of the biggest names in the space include Alcon, which is owned by Novartis AG (NOVN.S), Bausch and Lomb, owned by Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX.TO), and Vistakon, owned by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N).  Since 2007, TPG has invested more than $8 billion in its healthcare portfolio. This year has been a relatively slow year for M&A; in the medical devices sector, with one very large, notable exception in Abbott Laboratories’ (ABT.N) $25 billion agreement to acquire rival St. Jude Medical STJ.N in April.  Abbott also agreed to acquire diagnostics company Alere Inc ALR.N earlier in the year for nearly $6 billion.

940,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson raises 2016 forecast, shares touch record high","(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on Tuesday raised its full-year 2016 sales and earnings forecasts and reported quarterly results that beat  estimates, helped by strength in its prescription drugs business. Shares of the diversified healthcare products maker rose 1.6 percent at $125.06 on the New York Stock Exchange after touching a new record high of $125.75. Analysts said the overall results bode well for J&J; shares. “... We expect today’s results to drive further upside and, given investor preference for safer names with good dividend yields in the current market environment, we think it bodes well for the stock over the near term,” said Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan. Strong demand for the company’s Imbruvica cancer drug and Xarelto blood thinner boosted pharmaceutical sales, which jumped 8.9 percent to $8.7 billion in the quarter. Sales of autoimmune drug Remicade, J&J;’s biggest product, rose 6.7 percent to $1.78 billion.  The company, which is the first major U.S. drugmaker to announce quarterly earnings, raised its 2016 sales forecast to a range of $71.5 billion to $72.2 billion, from $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion previously.  J&J; expects sales to grow at a faster rate than the global healthcare market, which it sees increasing by 3 percent to 5 percent annually over the next five years, Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky said on a conference call. The maker of a variety of products from Tylenol to Band-Aid bandages to Acuvue contact lenses also increased its adjusted profit range to $6.63 to $6.73 per share, from $6.53 to $6.68.  Investors have been concerned about potential competition to Remicade in the United States.

945,JNJ,J&J; unit's former executives convicted of unapproved marketing,"(Reuters) - Two former executives of Acclarent Inc, a medical device company bought by Johnson & Johnson in 2010, were convicted on Wednesday by a U.S. jury on charges of promoting a product for an unapproved use. Former Acclarent Chief Executive William Facteau and former Vice President of Sales Patrick Fabian were found guilty in federal court in Boston of 10 misdemeanor counts of violating the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, federal prosecutors said in a statement. The counts each carry a maximum prison sentence of one year. The jury acquitted the men of more serious felony counts of wire fraud and conspiracy, finding they did not act with intent to defraud or mislead. Facteau’s attorney, Reid Weingarten, and Fabian’s attorney, Frank Libby, said in a statement they would move to overturn the convictions. The verdict came after legal setbacks in recent years for regulators’ attempting to curb the promotion of drugs and devices for unapproved uses, known as off-label marketing. In an indictment unsealed last April, federal prosecutors said that beginning in 2006 or earlier, Facteau, 47, and Fabian, 49, promoted Acclarent’s Relieva Stratus Microflow Spacer device to deliver steroid medications to patients’ sinuses, though it was only approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for keeping sinuses open. Prosecutors said Facteau and Fabian had hoped to increase the company’s revenue to make it an attractive acquisition target, and concealed the off-label marketing from potential buyers, including J&J; unit Ethicon Inc. Ethicon bought California-based Acclarent in early 2010 for about $785 million. Facteau and Fabian received compensation worth about $30 million and $4 million, respectively, from the deal, according to the indictment.  Facteau and Fabian stayed with the company until 2011 and told the sales force to sell the device as a way to deliver steroids, even after Ethicon executives told them to stop promoting it at all, according to the indictment. Facteau is currently CEO of hearing aid company Earlens. Drug companies have successfully argued in court that some off-label marketing is legal. In March, a Manhattan federal judge ruled that Amarin Corp could promote its fish oil-based pill Vascepa off-label, finding it had the right under the First Amendment to make non-misleading statements about its products. In 2012, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the conviction of a drug salesman for promoting Jazz Pharmaceuticals’ narcolepsy drug Xyrem off-label, also on First Amendment grounds.

948,JNJ,UPDATE 2-Drugmaker AbbVie bumps up profit forecast on strong Humira sales,"(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, driven by demand for its flagship drug Humira, and raised its earnings forecast for the year. Humira - the world’s biggest-selling drug - generated about $14 billion in sales last year and accounted for about 64 percent of AbbVie’s net revenue in the quarter. The drug, used to treat forms of arthritis and Crohn’s disease among other conditions, generated sales of $4.15 billion in the quarter, topping the consensus estimate of $3.93 billion, compiled by Evercore ISI. Humira’s main patent lapses in December, opening the drug up to potential competition from cheaper biosimilars being developed by companies including Amgen Inc (AMGN.O), Coherus Biosciences Inc (CHRS.O) and Germany’s Boehringer Ingelheim. Amgen, as the first to seek U.S. approval, could end up first to market, after an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration backed its copycat version earlier this month. AbbVie, however, has said numerous other patents will stave off the introduction of biosimilar forms of Humira until at least 2022. “Much of the debate around AbbVie is on the longer-term durability of Humira and on that point we expect nothing to really change despite the strong quarter,” Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note. To be sure, AbbVie has been diversifying its portfolio to reduce its overwhelming dependence on Humira. The company said in April it would buy cancer drug developer Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion. Last year, the suburban Chicago drugmaker bought Pharmacyclics Inc and its half-ownership of cancer drug Imbruvica for $21 billion. AbbVie sells the drug with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and said it brought in quarterly sales of $439 million, exceeding the consensus estimate by $9 million. AbbVie’s hepatitis C treatment Viekira Pak, which competes with drugs from Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), brought in sales of $419 million, versus the consensus estimate of $411 million. AbbVie raised its adjusted full-year profit forecast to $4.73-$4.83 per share from its previous projection of $4.62-$4.82. For the second quarter ended June 30, net revenue rose 17.8 percent to $6.45 billion. On an adjusted basis, revenue was $6.43 billion, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $6.2 billion. Excluding special items, AbbVie earned $1.26 per share, beating the average analyst estimate by 6 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/. The drugmaker’s stock was up about 1.4 percent in early trading on Friday.

952,JNJ,UPDATE 5-Pfizer boosts cancer drug roster with $14 bln Medivation deal,"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), beating out numerous other bidders, said it agreed to buy U.S. cancer drug company Medivation Inc MDVN.O for $14 billion in cash, adding its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi to the company’s growing oncology roster. Medivation shares jumped nearly 20 percent to close at $80.42, just shy of the offer price of $81.50 per share. Shares of Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker, were down 0.4 percent at $34.84.  The offer is a 55-percent premium to Sanofi SA’s (SASY.PA) initial bid to buy Medivation for $52.50 per share in April, which pushed the San Francisco-based company to put itself up for sale. It represents a 118-percent increase since Reuters reported on March 30 that Medivation had hired JP Morgan to handle interest from companies in a potential acquisition.    The planned purchase of Medivation, with its $2.2 billion-a-year Xtandi, is the latest in a number of deals by large drugmakers willing to pay top dollar for cancer drugs that are more effective than standard, older treatments. Perhaps the most notable example is AbbVie Inc’s (ABBV.N) $21 billion purchase last year of Pharmacyclics. The deal gave AbbVie shared ownership with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in the blockbuster leukemia drug Imbruvica. Analysts predicted the deal would not raise antitrust concerns because Pfizer does not currently sell a prostate cancer drug aside from generics.   Pfizer said its earnings would increase immediately after buying Medivation. The deal comes four months after Pfizer and Ireland-based Allergan Plc (AGN.N) scrapped their $160 billion merger. Pfizer has since bought Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc in a $5.2 billion deal to add an eczema gel to its portfolio. The Medivation deal illustrates a shift in Pfizer’s M&A; strategy from lowering taxes - the rationale behind the failed Allergan tax inversion deal - to strengthening its lineup of branded drugs, especially lucrative cancer treatments. Pfizer, in a conference call with analysts, said it still plans to decide by year-end whether to split into separate companies selling either low-growth generics or patent-protected brand medicines.  “The Medivation deal increases the likelihood of a split,” said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris. But, he said, Pfizer would likely first try to buy other drugmakers or their best assets in order to further strengthen its branded-drug portfolio. A year ago, Pfizer paid $15 billion for Hospira, which sells generic hospital products and is developing biosimilars meant to compete with big-selling injectable biotech drugs. That deal was seen by Wall Street as a way of bolstering its generic drugs ahead of potentially divesting the business.  Pfizer’s biggest growth driver is a new breast cancer drug called Ibrance. The company is also trying to catch up with Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) in developing immuno-oncology drugs that work by taking the brakes off the immune system to fight cancers. Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told analysts the Medivation deal was mainly driven by the desire to obtain Xtandi, although he expressed high hopes for talazoparib and pidilizumab, experimental Medivation drugs for breast cancer and lymphoma, respectively. Xtandi generated U.S. net sales of $330.3 million in the second quarter. Japanese drugmaker Astellas Pharma Inc (4503.T) owns the rights to sell Xtandi outside the United States, where it generated sales of $240 million in the period. Read said Xtandi, which was approved four years ago to treat men who had failed to benefit from prostate cancer treatments, could capture far greater sales if it is eventually approved for earlier use and is prescribed by urologists. “The product is just at the beginning of its growth cycle,” Read predicted.  Some analysts, including BMO’s Alex Arfaei, said Pfizer appeared to be overpaying for Medivation. But Piper Jaffray analyst Richard Purkiss said the price is not excessive given Xtandi’s potential for earlier treatment in coming years. Reuters had reported that Pfizer, Merck, Celgene Corp (CELG.O) and Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) had submitted expressions of interest to buy Medivation.   “Given the already very high price being discussed, the difficult public relationship between Medivation and Sanofi ...  we see a higher bid as very unlikely, but not impossible,” RBC Capital Partners wrote in a client note ahead of the announcement.      Sanofi said while it recognized the potential strategic benefits of a combination with Medivation, it was a “disciplined acquirer and remained committed to acting in the best interests of Sanofi shareholders.”  Pfizer said the deal was approved by boards of both companies and should be completed in the third or fourth quarter. Shares of other cancer drug companies, including Incyte Corp (INCY.O) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN.O), also rose on Monday, as investors speculated about  more dealmaking in the sector.  Pfizer’s financial advisers were Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners, with Ropes & Gray LLP providing legal counsel.  J.P. Morgan Securities and Evercore were Medivation’s financial advisers, while Cooley LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as its legal advisers.

953,JNJ,Abbott to sell its eye care business to J&J; for about $4.33 billion,"(Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) said it would sell its eye care business to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) for about $4.33 billion in cash to focus on cardiovascular devices and diagnostics business.      The company expanded its medical device and diagnostics businesses this year with a $25 billion deal for St. Jude Medical Inc STJ.N and a $5.8 billion deal for Alere Inc ALR.N. Abbott Medical Optics, which the company acquired for nearly $1.4 billion in 2009, reported sales of $1.1 billion for 2015, J&J; said on Friday.

958,JNJ,FDA approves J&J;'s autoimmune drug Stelara for Crohn's disease,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Monday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the company’s blockbuster psoriasis drug, Stelara, for use in adults with Crohn’s disease.  The drug is approved in the United States to treat the skin condition scaly plaque psoriasis and a type of arthritis associated with psoriasis. Crohn’s is a chronic inflammatory condition in the gastrointestinal tract, causing abdominal pain, diarrhea,  rectal bleeding, weight loss and fever. It affects about 700,000 Americans and nearly 250,000 Europeans, according to the company. The drug, which blocks two inflammation-causing proteins IL-12 and IL-23, is one of J&J;’s largest revenue generators, with sales of about $2.5 billion in 2015. Late-stage trial data showed Stelara induced remissions in moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease patients who had previously failed to benefit from TNF inhibitors, a leading class of medicines for the inflammatory bowel disease. These treatments include J&J;’s own Remicade and AbbVie Inc’s Humira. J&J;’s shares were about a percent at $117.83 in morning trading.

962,JNJ,Novartis psoriasis drug maintains efficacy after four years: study,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis’s psoriasis drug Cosentyx showed long-term efficacy in keeping patients’ skin clear, the Swiss drugmaker said on Saturday, citing a study it hopes will ultimately help the company to win business from rival medicines made by Amgen and Johnson & Johnson. More than 66 percent of Cosentyx patients achieved “clear or almost clear” skin after four years, Novartis said, comparable with the 68.5 percent who hit that milestone after one year.  A durable response is important, since older biotech drugs for plaque psoriasis, known as anti-TNFs, can lose their effectiveness over time. Cosentyx’s second-quarter sales hit $260 million from $30 million in the second quarter of 2015, just after it went on sale, largely as it won patients from anti-TNFs such as Amgen’s Enbrel.  With Novartis aiming for $5 billion in peak annual revenue, the company is now pushing for more dermatologists to shift patients to Cosentyx from Johnson & Johnson's Stelara. (tinyurl.com/jevenh5) “Our focus has been continuing to generate the data and convince physicians that it’s worth making the switch,” said Vasant Narasimhan, Novartis chief medical officer, in an interview ahead of a dermatology congress in Vienna.  “Now you have data out to four years showing we’ve maintained the efficacy, at the levels that we saw after year one,” Narasimhan said. Novartis’s findings released on Saturday also showed Cosentyx helped 60 percent of people with psoriasis on their hands and feet achieve clear or nearly clear skin on these difficult-to-treat areas. Since its introduction in early 2015, Cosentyx has won EU and U.S. approval for psoriasis as well as for active ankylosing spondolitis and psoriatic arthritis, a painful autoimmune condition that damages joints and to which many psoriasis patients are vulnerable.

964,JNJ,J&J; warns diabetic patients: Insulin pump vulnerable to hacking,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is telling patients that it has learned of a security vulnerability in one of its insulin pumps that a hacker could exploit to overdose diabetic patients with insulin, though it describes the risk as low. Medical device experts said they believe it was the first time a manufacturer had issued such a warning to patients about a cyber vulnerability, a hot topic in the industry following revelations last month about possible bugs in pacemakers and defibrillators. J&J; executives told Reuters they knew of no examples of attempted hacking attacks on the device, the J&J; Animas OneTouch Ping insulin pump. The company is nonetheless warning customers and providing advice on how to fix the problem. “The probability of unauthorized access to the OneTouch Ping system is extremely low,” the company said in letters sent on Monday to doctors and about 114,000 patients who use the device in the United States and Canada. “It would require technical expertise, sophisticated equipment and proximity to the pump, as the OneTouch Ping system is not connected to the internet or to any external network.” A copy of the text of the letter was made available to Reuters. Insulin pumps are medical devices that patients attach to their bodies that injects insulin through catheters. The Animas OneTouch Ping, which was launched in 2008, is sold with a wireless remote control that patients can use to order the pump to dose insulin so that they do not need access to the device itself, which is typically worn under clothing and can be awkward to reach. Jay Radcliffe, a diabetic and researcher with cyber security firm Rapid7 Inc, said he had identified ways for a hacker to spoof communications between the remote control and the OneTouch Ping insulin pump, potentially forcing it to deliver unauthorized insulin injections. The system is vulnerable because those communications are not encrypted, or scrambled, to prevent hackers from gaining access to the device, said Radcliffe, who reported vulnerabilities in the pump to J&J; in April and published them on the Rapid7 blog on Tuesday. (bit.ly/2dOUm0e) J&J; executives said they worked on the security issues with Radcliffe. Dosing a patient with too much insulin could cause hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, which in extreme cases can be life threatening, said Brian Levy, chief medical officer with J&J;’s diabetes unit. Company technicians were able to replicate Radcliffe’s findings, confirming that a hacker could order the pump to dose insulin from a distance of up to 25 feet, Levy said. He said such attacks are difficult to pull off because they require specialized technical expertise and sophisticated equipment. “We believe the OneTouch Ping system is safe and reliable. We urge patients to stay on the product,” Levy said. J&J;’s letter said that if patients were concerned, they could take several steps to thwart potential attacks. They include discontinuing use of a wireless remote control and programming the pump to limit the maximum insulin dose. Radcliffe said he believed that OneTouch Ping users would be safe if they followed the steps outlined in the letters from J&J.; “They can give peace of mind to the patient or parent of a child using the device,” he said. In August, a prominent short seller and a cyber security research firm went public with allegations of potentially life-threatening cyber vulnerabilities in heart devices from St. Jude Medical Inc. As its shares tumbled, St. Jude said the allegations were false, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began an investigation. J&J; said before it sent out the letters, it reviewed the matter with the FDA, which is preparing to issue formal guidance on how medical device makers should handle reports about cyber vulnerabilities. An early draft of that guidance, which was released in January for public comments, called for device makers to work with security researchers, identify steps to mitigate risks, and provide patients with information about bugs so they can “make informed decisions” about device use. The FDA on Tuesday praised J&J; and Rapid7 for their work in discovering, finding ways to mitigate and disclosing the vulnerability. “This is the proactive behavior the FDA has been looking to see from the medical device manufacturer and research community and demonstrates the collaborative manner in which vulnerabilities can be addressed in a way that best protects patients,” the agency said in a statement. J&J; Chief Information Security Officer Marene Allison said her team would make sure other J&J; products do not have similar bugs. Radcliffe said he found vulnerabilities in the Animas OneTouch Ping, but not the Animas Vibe line of insulin pumps.

967,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson letter on cyber bug in insulin pump,"(Reuters) - The following is the text of a letter mailed to patients on Monday by Johnson & Johnson’s Animas diabetes unit describing a cyber security vulnerability in its Animas OneTouch Ping insulin pump: “Dear Valued Animas® OneTouch® Ping® Pump User,  Since 2008, the OneTouch® Ping® insulin pump system has been helping people with diabetes perform at their best, and we are committed to providing our customers with safe and reliable products.  We have been notified of a cybersecurity issue with the OneTouch® Ping®, specifically that a person could potentially gain unauthorized access to the pump through its unencrypted radio frequency communication system. We want you to know that Animas has investigated this issue and has worked with the appropriate regulatory authorities and security experts, as we are always evaluating ways to further ensure patient safety and security.  We also want to assure you that the probability of unauthorized access to the One Touch® Ping® System is extremely low. It would require technical expertise, sophisticated equipment and proximity to the pump, as the OneTouch Ping® system is not connected to the internet or to any external network. In addition, the system has multiple safeguards to protect its integrity and prevent unauthorized action.  If you are concerned about unauthorized access for any reason, the pump’s radio frequency feature can be turned off, which is explained in Chapter 2 of Section III of the OneTouch® Ping® Owner’s Booklet. However, turning off this feature means that the pump and meter will no longer communicate and blood glucose readings will need to be entered manually on the pump.  If you choose to use the meter remote feature, another option for protection is to program the OneTouch® Ping® pump to limit the amount of bolus insulin that can be delivered. Bolus deliveries can be limited through a number of customizable settings (maximum bolus amount, 2-hour amount, and total daily dose). Any attempt to exceed or override these settings will trigger a pump alarm and prevent bolus insulin delivery. For more information, please see Chapter 10 of Section I of the OneTouch® Ping® Owner’s Booklet.  We also suggest turning on the Vibrating Alert feature of the OneTouch® Ping® System, as described in Chapter 4 of Section I. This notifies the user that a bolus dose is being initiated by the meter remote, which gives the patient the option of canceling the bolus.  The bolus delivery alert and the customizable limits on bolus insulin can only be enabled on the pump and cannot be altered by the meter remote. This is also true of basal insulin. We also remind you that any insulin delivery and the source of the delivery (pump or meter remote) are recorded in the pump history, so you can review the bolus dosing.  The OneTouch® Ping® System continues to be safe and effective for helping you manage your diabetes.

968,JNJ,Special Report: How Fidelity's owners get richer at everyday investors' expense,"BOSTON (Reuters) - (Due to inaccurate data in Fidelity’s original filing, this October 5 story corrects to show that Fidelity’s venture arm’s investment in Adaptimmune rose to $41 million, not $270 million; that Fidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio paid at least four times more than rivals for shares, not 24 times; and that the venture arm got its Adaptimmune shares for about $3.54 each, not 59 cents each.) The mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, founded seven decades ago and run ever since by the Johnson family, has won the trust of tens of millions of investors. The company’s tradition of putting clients’ interests “before our own is a big part of what makes Fidelity special,” the fund firm says in its mission statement. In at least one lucrative field, however, the Johnson family’s interests come first. A private venture capital arm run on behalf of the Johnsons, F-Prime Capital Partners, competes directly with the stable of Fidelity mutual funds in which the public invests. It’s an arrangement that securities lawyers say poses an unusual conflict of interest. That conflict can be seen in the case of Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc, a promising biotech start-up. In 2011 and 2012, the Johnsons’ F-Prime Capital invested a total of $11 million on Ultragenyx before the start-up made an initial public offering of its stock. The pre-IPO investment effectively prevented Fidelity mutual funds from making the same play. If both the private fund and Fidelity’s ordinary funds had invested, they would have violated U.S. securities laws, which prohibit affiliated entities from buying substantial stakes in the same companies at the same time. The managers of Fidelity’s public funds eventually did purchase Ultragenyx shares, but not until after the stock price skyrocketed in the firm’s January 2014 initial public offering. The Fidelity funds bought about 1.1 million Ultragenyx shares in the second quarter of 2014. The average price for the stock was $41.17 during that three-month period - 12 times higher than the $3.55 a share paid by F-Prime Capital. By the end of June 2014, the Johnson family and an elite circle of Fidelity insiders were sitting on a gain of $128 million - or about 1,000 percent - on the Ultragenyx investment. Several of Fidelity’s mutual fund rivals, including American Funds and BlackRock Inc, did just as well or better on the Ultragenyx play by investing at about the same time as the Johnsons, U.S. regulatory filings show. GRAPHIC: A 6,101-percent gain: tmsnrt.rs/2dr0vAD Fidelity declined to comment on the specific investments examined by Reuters and declined to detail how it balances the interests of Fidelity funds and the Johnsons’ F-Prime funds in cases where they might compete for the same investment. Fidelity’s chief executive, Abigail Johnson, declined to comment for this story. Yale University law professor John Morley said Fidelity runs the risk of losing investors by competing with the funds that serve them. “What they’re doing is not illegal, not even unethical,” Morley said. “But it’s entirely appropriate for mutual fund investors to take their money elsewhere because Fidelity has made a decision to take away some of their potential returns.” Alan Palmiter, a business law professor at Wake Forest University, called the arrangement more problematic because it directly pits the interests of Fidelity fund investors against those of Fidelity’s owners and elite managers. “It’s hard to imagine a clearer corporate conflict of interest,” Palmiter said. SEC spokeswoman Judith Burns said the agency could not comment on a specific company. Reuters analyzed 10 pre-IPO investments since the beginning of 2013 by the Johnson-led venture capital arm. The analysis found that, in six of those cases, Fidelity’s mass-market mutual funds made major investments later and at much higher prices than the insiders’ fund, resulting in lower returns for Fidelity fund shareholders. In the other four cases, Fidelity funds did not invest at all in companies in which the Johnson-led venture arm already had a sizable stake. Fidelity’s internal guidelines prevent such investments when the Johnsons’ venture holdings are “substantial,” a standard that Fidelity declined to define to Reuters.  The Reuters examination also found: • Over the past three years, U.S. regulatory filings show, the Johnson-led venture arm has beaten Fidelity mutual funds to some of the hottest prospects in tech and bioscience - including the best performing IPO of 2015. • Fidelity mutual funds became one of the largest investors in six bioscience and tech companies backed by F-Prime Capital after the start-ups became publicly traded. Legal and academic experts said that major investments by Fidelity mutual funds - with their market-moving buying power - could be seen as propping up the values of the Johnsons’ venture holdings. • Key compliance executives have held dual roles overseeing investments by Fidelity and F-Prime Capital. For three years until September, the chief compliance officer for Fidelity mutual funds, Linda Wondrack, also served as chief compliance officer for Impresa Management LLC, the advisory firm that manages the investments of F-Prime Capital. Fidelity’s James Curvey also wears two hats: He chairs a board of trustees that oversees many Fidelity stock mutual funds, and also serves as a trustee for one of the owners of Impresa. Curvey has been involved with the Johnsons’ private investments for more than 20 years and has made millions of dollars from them. • Some portfolio managers for Fidelity’s mass-market funds receive lucrative partnership interests in the private F-Prime funds. Star portfolio manager Will Danoff, for instance, donated $4 million worth of Alibaba Group stock to Harvard University in 2015 that he received through the venture arm for $3,432, according to his family’s charitable foundation. Fidelity spokesman Vincent Loporchio said Fidelity executives declined to grant interviews for this story. In a written statement, Fidelity said it follows the law relating to potential conflicts of interest between its mutual funds and the venture capital arm. “We strictly adhere to all legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our management of our mutual funds and other client accounts and our proprietary venture capital investments,” Fidelity said. “Where there is the potential for such investments to overlap, we apply internal guidelines designed to ensure that our mutual funds comply with relevant legal and regulatory restrictions on their ability to acquire securities issued by companies in which Fidelity has a pre-existing proprietary investment.” Fidelity declined to comment on whether its mutual funds were interested in making the same pre-IPO bets as F-Prime Capital. Over the past three years, however, the mutual funds have been among the nation’s biggest investors in pre-IPO companies, U.S. regulatory filings show. The pressure on Fidelity to produce market-breaking returns has never been higher. Since the end of 2008, investors have pulled nearly $100 billion from Fidelity’s actively managed mutual funds, while net deposits into Vanguard Group’s index funds approached $700 billion, according to Morningstar Inc data. Fidelity’s two top rivals, BlackRock and Vanguard, said they do not operate separate investment arms that might compete with their mutual funds. Vanguard Chairman and CEO William McNabb goes a step further, investing almost all of his personal financial assets in Vanguard funds, because he wants to ensure his interests are aligned with those of his customers, said company spokesman John Woerth. Fidelity Investments is owned by privately held FMR LLC, which is controlled by the Johnson family. The family, along with a small group of FMR employees and shareholders, are also investors in F-Prime Capital, the private venture capital arm. GRAPHIC: Investing for the elite. tmsnrt.rs/2dprVdt Johnson family members and Fidelity insiders also own Impresa Management, which runs partnerships and investments on F-Prime’s behalf, overseeing about $2.6 billion in assets, according to SEC disclosures. Impresa’s strategy is to bet on promising bioscience and tech start-ups. If F-Prime controls 5 percent or more of a private company’s voting stock, then that ownership prevents the Fidelity mutual funds from buying the same security before or during an IPO, according to the Investment Company Act of 1940. Fidelity told Reuters that it concurs with that reading of the law, which is enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission. SEC rules aim to ensure that the interests of mutual funds are on at least equal footing with the interests of affiliates, said Joseph Franco, a law professor at Suffolk University Law School in Boston. The rules seek to prohibit a situation where, for instance, a mutual fund might invest in a pre-IPO company at an above-market price with the intent of boosting the value of an earlier, lower-priced investment by an affiliated entity. The rules also seek to ensure that mutual fund managers are not influenced by the interests of an affiliated entity, such as Fidelity’s in-house venture operation, Franco said. The law would not prevent purchases of stock owned by an affiliated entity after an IPO, in the open market. But Fidelity said it applies its own guidelines, which prevent such purchases when there is a “substantial” level of ownership by F-Prime. The guidelines are meant to address potential conflicts of interest and questions of fairness for investors in Fidelity mutual funds, the company said. John Bonnanzio, an editor at Fidelity Monitor & Insights, which makes independent recommendations on Fidelity funds, said the Johnson-led venture investing has been a good way to reward and retain star portfolio managers such as Danoff. “Hedge funds have siphoned off a lot of good portfolio managers from mutual fund companies,” Bonnanzio said.  Founded in 1946 by Abigail Johnson’s grandfather, Edward Johnson II, Fidelity’s mutual fund business manages $1.2 trillion in assets. Privately held Fidelity is still controlled by the family and has been the linchpin of their fortune. The clan’s net worth is estimated at $26 billion by Forbes magazine, making them the 9th-richest family in the United States. The founder eventually turned the reins over to his son, Fidelity’s chairman, Edward “Ned” Johnson III, who is now 86. Today, Abigail Johnson, 54, is heir apparent. The oldest of Ned’s three children, Abigail spent her career preparing for the top job, starting at Fidelity as an intern before moving on to portfolio manager and now CEO. She lives in the home once owned by her grandfather. Abigail and her younger siblings, Elizabeth and Edward Johnson IV, are investors in F-Prime Capital, according to disclosures by the venture fund. The family’s private investments sometimes dovetail with members’ personal interests. In 1985, Ned Johnson used venture funding to launch a limousine service after it took too long to hail a taxi at Boston’s airport, according to accounts in the Boston Globe. Abigail Johnson’s husband, Christopher McKown, co-founded a healthcare start-up, Iora Health, that has received multiple rounds of investment from F-Prime. Over the years, F-Prime and other venture investing entities have generated billions of dollars in gains for the family and company insiders, according to financial disclosures made by Fidelity. Ned Johnson has used part of his wealth to amass a collection of antiquities worth nearly $260 million through his nonprofit Brookfield Arts Foundation, according to the charity’s 2014 annual report. The nonprofit’s purchases include a 200-year-old Chinese merchant house that Johnson had moved from that country and reassembled at the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts. The house and its contents are worth $17 million, according to Brookfield’s 2014 disclosure to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Other beneficiaries of the venture investments include top Fidelity officials such as Peter Lynch, the legendary Magellan fund manager and Fidelity vice chairman, and current portfolio managers such as Danoff, who manages about $109 billion in assets at Fidelity’s Contrafund. The Ultragenyx investment illustrates the opportunity cost Fidelity investors face when a mass-market fund encounters a conflict of interest with F-Prime. TIMELINE: Owners vs. investors. tmsnrt.rs/2dr0kFI Ultragenyx was hardly a hidden gem. Several of Fidelity’s rivals, including American Funds, BlackRock and Columbia Management, also got in on the early action before the company’s initial public offering. Columbia’s Acorn Fund, for example, invested $10 million at the same time as F-Prime and had an unrealized gain of nearly 1,100 percent, or $108 million, in mid-2015 before unwinding part of its position, U.S. regulatory filings show. In the third quarter of 2014, Fidelity funds boosted their collective stake in Ultragenyx by 3.3 million shares to become the biotech firm’s largest mutual fund investor, with nearly 4.6 million total shares. By then, the average closing price of the stock had moved up to $50.24 from $41.17 in the second quarter. During the same quarter, F-Prime unwound most of its stake in Ultragenyx by distributing the stock to limited and general partners, U.S. regulatory filings show. Asked about F-Prime, Fidelity said in a statement that its mutual funds get priority over the Johnson family’s interests.”When both our proprietary venture capital group and our funds express interest in investing in the same private companies, the funds always prevail,” the company said in a statement.     One person who has been refereeing potential conflicts between Fidelity and Johnson family investments is Linda Wondrack. Until September, she doubled as chief compliance officer for the mutual funds and for Impresa Management, which manages the F-Prime assets. She served in both capacities for three years. In September - after Reuters asked whether Wondrack’s dual role presented a conflict of interest - Fidelity hired another executive to replace Wondrack in one of the two positions. The fund appointed a company veteran, Chuck Senatore, as chief compliance officer of Impresa Management. A single person could not effectively perform both jobs, said Wake Forest University’s Palmiter, who called the arrangement “nearly laughable.” Wondrack would have felt feel pressure to side with the venture capital arm because her ultimate boss is Abigail Johnson, said Palmiter, who has written extensively on the fund sector and is a critic of its governance standards. Wondrack, 52, is paid as an employee of Fidelity, U.S. regulatory filings show. She joined Fidelity in 2012, after working at mutual fund company Columbia Management. Loporchio, the Fidelity spokesman, said the company identified the need for a change in a “periodic review of its processes.” Another key overseer of Fidelity fund investors’ interests, however, continues to serve in a similar dual role. James C. Curvey - a long-time top lieutenant of Fidelity Chairman Ned Johnson - is chairman of the board of trustees for a number of Fidelity mutual funds, including ones that invest in the same companies as F-Prime. Fund trustees are responsible for protecting the interests of investors. Ned Johnson chose Curvey for the role when Johnson gave up his duties as chairman of the board of trustees for individual Fidelity funds. Curvey also serves a trustee for one of the owners of Impresa Management LLC, the manager of the F-Prime Capital’s venture investments. It’s not clear exactly who Curvey represents in that role; the stake is held in a trust, whose owners are not disclosed. But other filings indicate that Impresa is owned by the trusts of Johnson family members and Fidelity insiders. Curvey’s history with the Johnsons’ private investing entities dates back more than two decades. In 1996, along with Abigail and Ned Johnson, Curvey sought and received an SEC exemption in 1996 that gave Impresa more latitude to invest on behalf of high-ranking Fidelity employees, SEC records show. Partnership distributions to Curvey from venture investing have made him a lot of money.  Curvey, for example, made millions of dollars from the venture capital arm’s investment in Britain’s COLT Telecom. In 2000, he donated some of those gains, nearly $3 million, to his family’s charitable foundation, according to an annual filing with the IRS. Curvey and Wondrack declined to comment for this report. Fidelity declined to comment on the potential conflict of interest in their dual oversight roles. THE YEAR’S BEST-PERFORMING IPO Shareholders in the regular Fidelity mutual funds include millions of investors saving for retirement as well as employee 401(k) plans at top corporations such as Facebook, IBM and Oracle. Those mom-and-pop investors missed out on 2015’s best-performing IPO. Fidelity funds stayed on the sidelines as shares of Aclaris Therapeutics Inc skyrocketed after the drug maker listed its stock in October 2015. F-Prime invested $16.3 million in Aclaris before the IPO - a stake whose value soared to $83.2 million in the first three months after the public offering, U.S. regulatory filings show. Even if Fidelity fund managers had wanted to buy Aclaris shares after the IPO, in the open market, F-Prime’s stake of nearly 20 percent stake may have prevented them from doing so because of Fidelity’s guidelines on investing in companies in which the venture arm has a “substantial” stake. Aclaris was 2015’s top public debut, its shares appreciating 145 percent over the $11 IPO price, according to Renaissance Capital, an IPO research and management firm. At the end of June, F-Prime still held nearly 2.8 million Aclaris shares, a 13 percent stake, worth $51.5 million, according to Fidelity’s latest quarterly holdings disclosure. Fidelity funds did not own any Aclaris shares. Fidelity fund competitors had no restraints on investing in Aclaris. Franklin Templeton funds bought nearly 1.2 million shares in the company in the month of the IPO, Franklin disclosures show. The Fidelity competitors, including the Franklin Small Cap Growth Fund, saw their combined initial stake of $17.3 million more than double in less than two months. The Johnson-led venture arm scored another big payday when Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc went public in May 2015. F-Prime’s $8 million pre-IPO investment in the bioscience company surged in value to more than $41 million in the weeks after the IPO, Fidelity disclosures show. Investors in the American Funds SmallCap World Fund, a Fidelity competitor, capitalized, too. The SmallCap World Fund made a similar-sized pre-IPO investment and saw a similar return, American disclosures show. The Fidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio bought about 1.5 million Adaptimmune shares the month after the IPO. But the biotech fund paid at least four times more for its shares than rivals did, Fidelity Select disclosures show. As pre-IPO investors, F-Prime and the rival SmallCap World Fund got their Adaptimmune common stock, on a converted basis, for about $3.54 each, disclosures show. The exact amount paid by the Fidelity biotech fund was not disclosed. But it was at least $14 a share, which was the low point for Adaptimmune shares the month of the IPO. Adaptimmune traded recently at nearly $7 a share, which represents a big loss for the mass-market Fidelity biotech fund but a rich gain for the Johnsons’ F-Prime. In the six cases Reuters examined where Fidelity bought into investments that were already held by F-Prime, Fidelity funds became the largest or one of the largest shareholders. In general, newly minted public companies need long-term shareholders such as mutual funds in order to ride out the ups and the downs of the stock market, especially right after a public debut, said Bob Ackerman, founder and managing director of Allegis Capital, a venture firm based in San Francisco. An investment by Fidelity - the third-largest mutual fund firm in the United States - is a boost for any new public company. A big fund’s investment broadens the shareholder base and makes it easier for venture capital investors to exit their investment at a profit. “It’s a validation of the company and the exit strategy, especially if it’s a huge amount,” said Hans Tung, managing partner at GGV Capital. “It’s a good validation that a company has a lot of long-term growth potential ahead.” Fidelity said there has never been a situation where F-Prime has directed a Fidelity mutual fund to make an investment in one of F-Prime’s portfolio companies. Corporate governance and securities law specialists say that big Fidelity investments in companies owned by F-Prime could be interpreted as propping up the family’s interests and helping F-Prime’s exit strategy. “It does raise a potentially serious question,” said James Post, a professor emeritus of markets, public policy and law at Boston University. “The uniqueness of the Fidelity arrangement requires the highest level of integrity.” METHODOLOGY: How we analyzed the Johnsons’ trading Reuters combed through public securities filings to explore overlap between the investing activities of Fidelity Investments, which serves some 20 million clients, and proprietary investment vehicles of the family that controls Fidelity, the Johnsons. Reuters identified 10 investments in which F-Prime Capital Partners, controlled by the Johnsons, was competing on the same turf as Fidelity mutual funds. The examination covered a three-year period, from 2013 to the present. During this time, Fidelity mutual funds began ramping up their strategy of investing in pre-IPO start-up companies. It is possible that the examination missed other relevant examples among F-Prime Capital’s many investments.

The fund appointed a company veteran, Chuck Senatore, as chief compliance officer of Impresa Management. A single person could not effectively perform both jobs, said Wake Forest University’s Palmiter, who called the arrangement “nearly laughable.” Wondrack would have felt feel pressure to side with the venture capital arm because her ultimate boss is Abigail Johnson, said Palmiter, who has written extensively on the fund sector and is a critic of its governance standards. Wondrack, 52, is paid as an employee of Fidelity, U.S. regulatory filings show. She joined Fidelity in 2012, after working at mutual fund company Columbia Management. Loporchio, the Fidelity spokesman, said the company identified the need for a change in a “periodic review of its processes.” Another key overseer of Fidelity fund investors’ interests, however, continues to serve in a similar dual role. James C. Curvey - a long-time top lieutenant of Fidelity Chairman Ned Johnson - is chairman of the board of trustees for a number of Fidelity mutual funds, including ones that invest in the same companies as F-Prime. Fund trustees are responsible for protecting the interests of investors. Ned Johnson chose Curvey for the role when Johnson gave up his duties as chairman of the board of trustees for individual Fidelity funds. Curvey also serves a trustee for one of the owners of Impresa Management LLC, the manager of the F-Prime Capital’s venture investments. It’s not clear exactly who Curvey represents in that role; the stake is held in a trust, whose owners are not disclosed. But other filings indicate that Impresa is owned by the trusts of Johnson family members and Fidelity insiders. Curvey’s history with the Johnsons’ private investing entities dates back more than two decades. In 1996, along with Abigail and Ned Johnson, Curvey sought and received an SEC exemption in 1996 that gave Impresa more latitude to invest on behalf of high-ranking Fidelity employees, SEC records show. Partnership distributions to Curvey from venture investing have made him a lot of money.  Curvey, for example, made millions of dollars from the venture capital arm’s investment in Britain’s COLT Telecom. In 2000, he donated some of those gains, nearly $3 million, to his family’s charitable foundation, according to an annual filing with the IRS. Curvey and Wondrack declined to comment for this report. Fidelity declined to comment on the potential conflict of interest in their dual oversight roles. THE YEAR’S BEST-PERFORMING IPO Shareholders in the regular Fidelity mutual funds include millions of investors saving for retirement as well as employee 401(k) plans at top corporations such as Facebook, IBM and Oracle. Those mom-and-pop investors missed out on 2015’s best-performing IPO. Fidelity funds stayed on the sidelines as shares of Aclaris Therapeutics Inc skyrocketed after the drug maker listed its stock in October 2015. F-Prime invested $16.3 million in Aclaris before the IPO - a stake whose value soared to $83.2 million in the first three months after the public offering, U.S. regulatory filings show. Even if Fidelity fund managers had wanted to buy Aclaris shares after the IPO, in the open market, F-Prime’s stake of nearly 20 percent stake may have prevented them from doing so because of Fidelity’s guidelines on investing in companies in which the venture arm has a “substantial” stake. Aclaris was 2015’s top public debut, its shares appreciating 145 percent over the $11 IPO price, according to Renaissance Capital, an IPO research and management firm. At the end of June, F-Prime still held nearly 2.8 million Aclaris shares, a 13 percent stake, worth $51.5 million, according to Fidelity’s latest quarterly holdings disclosure. Fidelity funds did not own any Aclaris shares. Fidelity fund competitors had no restraints on investing in Aclaris. Franklin Templeton funds bought nearly 1.2 million shares in the company in the month of the IPO, Franklin disclosures show. The Fidelity competitors, including the Franklin Small Cap Growth Fund, saw their combined initial stake of $17.3 million more than double in less than two months. The Johnson-led venture arm scored another big payday when Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc went public in May 2015. F-Prime’s $8 million pre-IPO investment in the bioscience company surged in value to more than $41 million in the weeks after the IPO, Fidelity disclosures show. Investors in the American Funds SmallCap World Fund, a Fidelity competitor, capitalized, too. The SmallCap World Fund made a similar-sized pre-IPO investment and saw a similar return, American disclosures show. The Fidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio bought about 1.5 million Adaptimmune shares the month after the IPO. But the biotech fund paid at least four times more for its shares than rivals did, Fidelity Select disclosures show. As pre-IPO investors, F-Prime and the rival SmallCap World Fund got their Adaptimmune common stock, on a converted basis, for about $3.54 each, disclosures show. The exact amount paid by the Fidelity biotech fund was not disclosed. But it was at least $14 a share, which was the low point for Adaptimmune shares the month of the IPO. Adaptimmune traded recently at nearly $7 a share, which represents a big loss for the mass-market Fidelity biotech fund but a rich gain for the Johnsons’ F-Prime. In the six cases Reuters examined where Fidelity bought into investments that were already held by F-Prime, Fidelity funds became the largest or one of the largest shareholders. In general, newly minted public companies need long-term shareholders such as mutual funds in order to ride out the ups and the downs of the stock market, especially right after a public debut, said Bob Ackerman, founder and managing director of Allegis Capital, a venture firm based in San Francisco. An investment by Fidelity - the third-largest mutual fund firm in the United States - is a boost for any new public company. A big fund’s investment broadens the shareholder base and makes it easier for venture capital investors to exit their investment at a profit. “It’s a validation of the company and the exit strategy, especially if it’s a huge amount,” said Hans Tung, managing partner at GGV Capital. “It’s a good validation that a company has a lot of long-term growth potential ahead.” Fidelity said there has never been a situation where F-Prime has directed a Fidelity mutual fund to make an investment in one of F-Prime’s portfolio companies. Corporate governance and securities law specialists say that big Fidelity investments in companies owned by F-Prime could be interpreted as propping up the family’s interests and helping F-Prime’s exit strategy. “It does raise a potentially serious question,” said James Post, a professor emeritus of markets, public policy and law at Boston University. “The uniqueness of the Fidelity arrangement requires the highest level of integrity.” METHODOLOGY: How we analyzed the Johnsons’ trading Reuters combed through public securities filings to explore overlap between the investing activities of Fidelity Investments, which serves some 20 million clients, and proprietary investment vehicles of the family that controls Fidelity, the Johnsons. Reuters identified 10 investments in which F-Prime Capital Partners, controlled by the Johnsons, was competing on the same turf as Fidelity mutual funds. The examination covered a three-year period, from 2013 to the present. During this time, Fidelity mutual funds began ramping up their strategy of investing in pre-IPO start-up companies. It is possible that the examination missed other relevant examples among F-Prime Capital’s many investments.

970,JNJ,Pfizer to start shipping biosimilar version of J&J;'s Remicade in November,"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Monday it will begin shipping its biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade in late November at a 15 percent discount to current wholesale prices. The Pfizer drug, to be sold under the name Inflectra, is already available in Europe and other overseas markets and would be the second biosimilar medicine available in the United States. As it is not possible to produce exact copies of biotech drugs made from living cells, the cheaper versions - referred to as biosimilars rather than generics - are intended to provide cost savings compared with pricey biologic medicines. Remicade is J&J;’s biggest selling drug with U.S. sales of about $5 billion a year. J&J;’s forecasts for 2016 had assumed no competition from a Remicade biosimilar this year. Its shares slipped nearly 0.5 percent to $118.00 in after-hours trading. J&J; said in an emailed statement that it considers any sales by Pfizer of a Remicade biosimilar to be an “at risk launch.” That could entitle the company to triple damages if Pfizer is found in court to have infringed Remicade patents. A Pfizer spokeswoman said the company could not comment on ongoing litigation. Pfizer’s pricing for the drug below Remicade wholesale costs does not take into account discounts to health insurers, distributors or other purchasing organizations, the company said. JP Morgan analyst Michael Weinstein, in a research note, forecast a Remicade revenue decline of just over $1 billion in 2017, costing J&J; 20 cents in earnings per share. “Inflectra’s 15 percent discount should provide enough of an incentive to help attract new patients ... but probably won’t be enough of a discount to entice stable patients to switch over,” Weinstein said. J&J; said it expects to be competitive with the Remicade biosimilar. “We intend to compete through a variety of innovative contracting options, discounts and rebates to payers, providers and pharmacy benefit managers to ensure Remicade remains an affordable option for patients and physicians,” a J&J; statement said. In addition to rheumatoid arthritis Inflectra, like Remicade, is also approved to treat Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and the spine condition ankylosing spondylitits. Novartis (NOVN.S) last year began selling the first biosimilar in the United States, a cheaper version of Amgen’s (AMGN.O) infection fighter Neupogen called Zarxio. Several companies are developing biosimilar versions of the top-selling biotech medicines for rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.

978,JNJ,"After $195 million in talc verdicts, J&J; strives to change court","(Reuters) - After a $67.5 million jury verdict against Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) on Oct. 27 marked its third straight trial defeat in an onslaught of lawsuits claiming its talc-based products cause ovarian cancer, the company is hoping to reverse the trend by having the cases heard in a different court. All three awards, totaling around $195 million, were handed down in state court in St. Louis, Missouri, with the same judge presiding. Women or their families have filed 2,500 similar claims, the vast majority in the same court, which is one of several in the United States that attracts consumer lawsuits. The plaintiffs claim studies show J&J;’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products, when used in the vaginal area, increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The company counters that larger, more comprehensive studies show no such link. In a court filing in August, J&J; argued the case should be dismissed because plaintiffs’ lawyers tainted the St. Louis jury pool. The company said the other side spent almost $10 million on national and local television commercials in the previous year, with a disproportionate share of them running in St. Louis. The women’s lawyers have denied J&J;’s claim. The company also contended that, because most of them are not from St. Louis and the New Jersey-based company has no strong ties to the area, the cases should not have been heard there. The judge rejected both arguments. John Beisner, one of the top lawyers representing J&J;, said the company plans to make the same arguments to the Missouri Court of Appeals. If the St. Louis court is found not to have jurisdiction, the cases would have to be refiled elsewhere.  Beisner compared the St. Louis verdicts to a favorable ruling in September from a state court judge in New Jersey. That judge, who is presiding over some 200 talc cases, disqualified the plaintiffs’ experts on the grounds that their scientific testimony was too speculative. In the same decision, he dismissed the first two cases set for trial and the ruling is being appealed. J&J; unsuccessfully tried to block the testimony of the experts in St. Louis on similar grounds. The company will make the same challenge on appeal, Beisner said.  Last week’s $70 million verdict followed Missouri jury awards of $72 million in February and $55 million in May. The first big talc verdict in February was won by the family of Jacqueline Fox, who died in October 2015. Their lawyers said she used J&J; Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder daily for 35 years for genital hygiene before she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013. Jere Beasley, whose firm has filed hundreds of talc cases, including the three Missouri wins and two New Jersey dismissals, said the verdicts should prompt J&J; to make a deal.  “If I were representing them, I would say, folks, we need to sit down and regroup and start trying to settle these cases,” he said.  Large verdicts are relatively common in major product liability cases, and they are often reduced or overturned on appeal. One lawsuit against Merck & Co over its recalled painkiller Vioxx produced a $253 million verdict in 2005, which was thrown out three years later. Merck eventually settled most Vioxx cases for $4.85 billion in 2007.    Shareholders in J&J;, which had sales of $70 billion last year, have so far shrugged off the three talc verdicts, the first of the cases to go to trial. But if the trend continues, liability could mount. The company has not reported setting aside any litigation reserve to deal with talc cases, as it has with previous claims over antipsychotic drug Rispardal and recalled hip implants. J&J; no longer sells Shower to Shower, which was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2012. Though not a major seller on its own, Baby Powder is a recognized symbol of J&J;’s baby care line, which brought in $2 billion in revenue in 2015. Some legal experts said it made sense for J&J; to fight on. “Ordinarily I would say three verdicts like that would prompt you to think about settlement,” said University of Georgia Law School professor Elizabeth Burch, who researches product liability cases, but she said J&J;’s case is somewhat different. A settlement would not necessarily cap J&J;’s liability, Burch said, because its talc products are still on the market, unlike companies whose products have been recalled. Howard Erichson, a professor at Fordham School of Law, said the company also had valid concerns about the impact of a settlement on its position in the market. “This is not Vioxx.

979,JNJ,"Analysis: After $195 mln in talc verdicts, J&J; strives to change court","(Reuters) - After a $67.5 million jury verdict against Johnson & Johnson on Oct. 27 marked its third straight trial defeat in an onslaught of lawsuits claiming its talc-based products cause ovarian cancer, the company is hoping to reverse the trend by having the cases heard in a different court. All three awards, totaling around $195 million, were handed down in state court in St. Louis, Missouri, with the same judge presiding. Women or their families have filed 2,500 similar claims, the vast majority in the same court, which is one of several in the United States that attracts consumer lawsuits. The plaintiffs claim studies show J&J;’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products, when used in the vaginal area, increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The company counters that larger, more comprehensive studies show no such link. In a court filing in August, J&J; argued the case should be dismissed because plaintiffs’ lawyers tainted the St. Louis jury pool. The company said the other side spent almost $10 million on national and local television commercials in the previous year, with a disproportionate share of them running in St. Louis. The women’s lawyers have denied J&J;’s claim. The company also contended that, because most of them are not from St. Louis and the New Jersey-based company has no strong ties to the area, the cases should not have been heard there. The judge rejected both arguments. John Beisner, one of the top lawyers representing J&J;, said the company plans to make the same arguments to the Missouri Court of Appeals. If the St. Louis court is found not to have jurisdiction, the cases would have to be refiled elsewhere. Beisner compared the St. Louis verdicts to a favorable ruling in September from a state court judge in New Jersey. That judge, who is presiding over some 200 talc cases, disqualified the plaintiffs’ experts on the grounds that their scientific testimony was too speculative. In the same decision, he dismissed the first two cases set for trial and the ruling is being appealed. J&J; unsuccessfully tried to block the testimony of the experts in St. Louis on similar grounds. The company will make the same challenge on appeal, Beisner said. Last week’s $70 million verdict followed Missouri jury awards of $72 million in February and $55 million in May. The first big talc verdict in February was won by the family of Jacqueline Fox, who died in October 2015. Their lawyers said she used J&J; Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder daily for 35 years for genital hygiene before she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013. Jere Beasley, whose firm has filed hundreds of talc cases, including the three Missouri wins and two New Jersey dismissals, said the verdicts should prompt J&J; to make a deal. “If I were representing them, I would say, folks, we need to sit down and regroup and start trying to settle these cases,” he said. Large verdicts are relatively common in major product liability cases, and they are often reduced or overturned on appeal. One lawsuit against Merck & Co over its recalled painkiller Vioxx produced a $253 million verdict in 2005, which was thrown out three years later. Merck eventually settled most Vioxx cases for $4.85 billion in 2007. Shareholders in J&J;, which had sales of $70 billion last year, have so far shrugged off the three talc verdicts, the first of the cases to go to trial. But if the trend continues, liability could mount. The company has not reported setting aside any litigation reserve to deal with talc cases, as it has with previous claims over antipsychotic drug Rispardal and recalled hip implants. J&J; no longer sells Shower to Shower, which was acquired by Valeant Pharmaceuticals in 2012. Though not a major seller on its own, Baby Powder is a recognized symbol of J&J;’s baby care line, which brought in $2 billion in revenue in 2015. Some legal experts said it made sense for J&J; to fight on. “Ordinarily I would say three verdicts like that would prompt you to think about settlement,” said University of Georgia Law School professor Elizabeth Burch, who researches product liability cases, but she said J&J;’s case is somewhat different. A settlement would not necessarily cap J&J;’s liability, Burch said, because its talc products are still on the market, unlike companies whose products have been recalled. Howard Erichson, a professor at Fordham School of Law, said the company also had valid concerns about the impact of a settlement on its position in the market. “This is not Vioxx. This is not asbestos,” Erichson said. “This is a case where the company wants to defend its brand, and is not going to be anxious to announce a big settlement that appears to concede that the product is harmful.",11072016,http://www.reuters.com/article/johnsonjohnson-cancer-lawsuit/analysis-after-195-mln-in-talc-verdicts-jj-strives-to-change-court-idUSL1N1D80K8

981,JNJ,J&J; vaccine plus Gilead immune booster shows promise as HIV fighter,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - An experimental HIV vaccine from Johnson & Johnson combined with an immune system booster from Gilead Sciences Inc showed promise at keeping the virus at bay in monkeys even after treatments had stopped, marking yet another step toward the development of a so-called functional cure for HIV. Both companies are currently testing the products separately in early-stage trials in people with HIV. The study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, evaluated monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus, the monkey version of HIV, and showed the treatments were much more effective when used together than separately. All nine monkeys that got both treatments showed significantly reduced viral loads. In three of them, the combination therapy has kept the virus at bay for six months after antiretroviral therapy or ART drugs were stopped. The study is part of ongoing efforts to develop a so-called functional cure for HIV that would allow people infected with the virus to stop taking daily antiretroviral therapy. [L1N1CJ134] “Current antiretroviral drugs, although they’re lifesaving, do not cure HIV. They merely hold it in check. We are trying to develop strategies to achieve ART-free, long-term viral suppression,” said study author Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. For the study, the team used what is known as a “kick and kill” approach. The two-punch strategy is designed to lure dormant HIV-infected immune cells out of hiding places in the body and then attempt to eradicate them. The trial evaluated a therapeutic vaccine called Ad26/MVA, which J&J; and partners are testing in early-stage human trials. The vaccine works by provoking a broad immune response from the adaptive immune system, the part that recognizes specific pathogens and produces lasting immunity. They combined this with Gilead’s experimental drug called GS-986, a so-called TLR-7 agonist that kickstarts the innate immune system, a more generalized line of defense that mounts the body’s initial response to infection. Gilead is also testing this in trials of HIV-infected patients. In the study, they evaluated 36 monkeys infected with SIV that had been treated with ART for six months to get the virus under control. They then divided the group into four arms, with one getting the Ad26/MVA vaccine alone, another getting the TLR-7 agonist alone, a third getting the combination of the two, and a fourth getting a placebo. Then, they discontinued ART in all of the animals and monitored levels of the virus in their blood and lymph nodes. Animals that got Gilead’s TLR-7 agonist saw no benefit and the virus quickly rebounded. Those that got the vaccine alone showed some reduction of viral load and a modest delay in viral rebound. The biggest effect was in the combination group, which saw a 2.5 times longer delay in viral rebound compared to the control group. In this group, levels of virus in the blood were 50 times lower than in the controls, and the virus fell to undetectable levels in three of the animals, which have been off ART for six months with no viral rebound. “If all the animals’ viral loads had been undetectable, that would have been a home run,” said Barouch. “But the fact that all animals showed a reduction in viral load and three out of nine were undetectable, that’s a solid base hit. It’s definitely something that we can work from.” Barouch said his team has been in talks with both companies to test the combination therapy in patients with HIV.

988,JNJ,Actelion shares surge on reported J&J; takeover approach,"ZURICH/FRANKFURT, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Shares in Actelion Ltd  jumped as much as 19 percent to record highs on Friday on reports that U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson  was interested in a takeover of the fast-growing Swiss biotechnology firm. A person familiar with the situation told Reuters that Johnson & Johnson (J&J;) had met Actelion about a deal, and that there was broader interest from prospective suitors in the industry, after Bloomberg on Thursday reported J&J;’s interest. Deliberations were still at an early stage and Actelion was working with an adviser to explore options, Bloomberg said in its report. (bloom.bg/2g8UTe3) Actelion declined to comment. J&J; did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Swiss lung disease specialist has been seen as a takeover target. Any confirmation of talks by J&J; or Actelion would probably prompt competing bids, “most likely from” larger Swiss peer Novartis, one investment banker told Reuters. Another source close to Novartis, however, said the drugmaker was not very impressed by Actelion’s drug development pipeline. Actelion shares surged by 18.8 percent at one point to a peak of 187.70 Swiss francs, valuing the company at around $20 billion. They were up 13.9 percent by 1249 GMT, virtually matching the share’s total gains this year up to Thursday’s close. Eric Le Berrigaud, an analyst at brokerage Bryan Garnier, also expected big Swiss drugmakers to express interest in Actelion if either Actelion or J&J; confirm their talks. “We should then see many other (companies) interested (in Actelion). That will probably include at least one of the two other Basel-based companies,” Le Berrigaud said, referring to Novartis and Roche. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Bryan Garnier said a bid could be worth up to 220 francs or 250 francs per share, respectively, stoked by appetite in the industry for fast growing businesses. Actelion’s Opsumit and Uptravi drugs to treat the life-threatening condition of high pressure in blood vessels to the lungs will generate more than $4.6 billion in combined 2020 sales, analysts forecast, up from an estimated 1.4 billion this year. Actelion’s recently launched drugs would be attractive to big pharmaceutical companies with deep pockets, but its co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel, who holds a 3.5 percent stake, could put up a fight as he has repeatedly said he wants the company to remain independent. In 2011, he managed to rally shareholders against activist investor Elliott’s campaign to put the biotech firm on the auction block. The shares have more than tripled since then. “We continue to believe that management, as quoted on many conference calls and public presentations, remains committed to Actelion as an independent company,” Barclays analysts said. J&J; agreed to buy Abbott Laboratories’ eye care business for about $4.33 billion in cash in September and Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said earlier this year that the company was interested in deals to expand its main consumer, medical device and pharmaceuticals segments. J&J; had derived about half its revenue from acquired products, he said. In October, Actelion raised its earnings guidance for the third time this year as sales from Opsumit and Uptravi for the first time surpassed those of Tracleer, its decade-long mainstay that lost U.S. patent protection last November.

The index is up 4.5 percent since Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election. “It looks as if the market is taking a breather after a good run. The market view is that Trump is going to spend more and will shield the U.S. more so that we get higher inflation and higher domestic growth,” Ronny Claeys, senior strategist at KBC Asset Management, said. “The market has reacted positively on Trump, but this could change as his policies are vague at this stage. Investors will react more on his policy details.” Gains in the broader market, however, were capped by weaker commodities stocks. The European oil and gas index fell 0.5 percent after crude oil prices slipped more than 1 percent on a strong dollar, rising Saudi supplies to Asian clients and a fall in Chinese imports. Miners fell 0.8 percent on a drop in major industrial metals, with shares in Anglo American, Antofagasta and Glencore declining between 1.0 percent and 1.8 percent.

994,JNJ,"Biotech group Actelion, Johnson & Johnson confirm deal talks","ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson said on Friday it was in preliminary talks with Actelion about a potential takeover of Europe’s largest biotech firm, currently valued at about $20 billion. Lung disease specialist Actelion confirmed it had been approached and said there was no certainty a deal would occur. An acquisition of the Swiss company would boosts J&J;’s drug pipeline and diversify its prospects. J&J;’s biggest product, the arthritis drug Remicade, faces cheaper competition from Pfizer Inc. Actelion shares surged nearly 19 percent to a peak of 187.70 Swiss francs on Friday, valuing the company at around $20 billion. They closed up 16.8 percent at 184.50 Swiss francs, more than matching the stock’s total gains this year up to Thursday’s close. The company’s focus on rare diseases makes it an attractive takeover target because drugs in that area are less prone to pricing pressure. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Bryan Garnier said a bid for Actelion could be worth up to 220 Swiss francs ($217) or 250 Swiss francs ($246) per share, respectively, stoked by appetite in the industry for fast-growing businesses.

995,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson approaches Actelion about takeover deal,"ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said on Friday it was in preliminary talks with Actelion ATLN.S about a potential takeover of Europe’s largest biotech firm, currently valued at about $20 billion.  Lung disease specialist Actelion confirmed it had been approached and said there was no certainty a deal would occur. An acquisition of the Swiss company would boosts J&J;’s drug pipeline and diversify its prospects. J&J;’s biggest product, the arthritis drug Remicade, faces cheaper competition from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N). Actelion shares surged nearly 19 percent to a peak of 187.70 Swiss francs on Friday, valuing the company at around $20 billion. They closed up 16.8 percent at 184.50 Swiss francs, more than matching the stock’s total gains this year up to Thursday’s close. The company’s focus on rare diseases makes it an attractive takeover target because drugs in that area are less prone to pricing pressure. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Bryan Garnier said a bid for Actelion could be worth up to 220 Swiss francs ($217) or 250 Swiss francs ($246) per share, respectively, stoked by appetite in the industry for fast-growing businesses. Actelion’s Opsumit and Uptravi drugs to treat the life-threatening condition of high pressure in blood vessels to the lungs will generate more than $4.6 billion in combined 2020 sales, analysts forecast, up from an estimated $1.4 billion this year. J&J;’s shares finished up nearly 1 percent at $114.13. J&J;’s chief executive, Alex Gorsky, said earlier this year that the company was interested in deals to expand its main consumer, medical device and pharmaceuticals segments. In September, J&J; agreed to buy Abbott Laboratories’ (ABT.N) eye care business for about $4.33 billion in cash. Actelion has long been seen as a takeover target. However, Actelion co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel, who holds a 3.5 percent stake in the company, has repeatedly said he wants it to remain independent. In 2011, Clozel rallied shareholders against activist investor Elliott Management’s campaign to put the biotech firm up for sale. Actelion’s shares have more than tripled since then. There may be broader interest from other suitors in Actelion, according to an investment banker who did not want to be named, who added that a competing bid could come “most likely” from larger Swiss peer Novartis AG (NOVN.S). Another source close to Novartis, however, said the company was not very impressed by Actelion’s drug pipeline. A spokesman from Novartis declined to comment.

997,JNJ,Actelion's ambitious independent-minded CEO will drive up takeover price,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Actelion Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel’s desire to keep Europe’s biggest biotech company independent after building it from scratch, means Johnson & Johnson will have to pay a steep premium if a takeover is to succeed. The U.S. healthcare titan on Friday confirmed talks with the Swiss maker of medicines for deadly pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). While Actelion confirmed the courtship, it said there was no guarantee of a deal. Actelion’s rare-disease focus makes it an attractive target, since its drugs face less price pressure than other more widely used medicines.  Analysts estimate a deal could be as high as 250 Swiss francs ($247) per share, valuing Actelion at around $26 billion, or $6 billion more than its current price even after the share’s 17 percent surge on Friday. Having fended off reported approaches by Shire in 2015 and hedge fund Elliott Advisors in 2011, Clozel, a French-born cardiologist, has repeatedly asserted his desire to go it alone, with his three main PAH drugs and with pipeline medicines he hopes will create a broad-based biotech company. This hard-to-get approach, coupled with the high value of recent deals in the sector, will drive up Actelion’s takeover price, analysts said.  “Similar deals have been at a 40-plus percent premium and we view 240 Swiss francs as a possible floor takeout value,” Jefferies analyst Peter Welford said. Analysts at Bryan Garnier suggested a bid price of up to 250 francs. In another recent biotech takeover, Pfizer paid $14 billion for cancer specialist Medivation, or double its pre-deal value. Switzerland’s Roche in 2014 paid $8.3 billion for InterMune, a 63 percent premium.  Clozel and his pediatrician-wife, Martine Clozel, Actelion’s chief science officer, own 5 percent of the company they founded in 1997. Close ties with Actelion’s Swiss shareholder base suggest they can mobilize support, should an offer not live up to their expectations, Welford said. If J&J; fails to strike a deal, a rival like Sanofi could well step in, analysts said. Actelion’s PAH portfolio is a potentially nice fit for the French drugmaker’s Genzyme rare disease unit. Sanofi, which lost out to Pfizer in the battle for Medivation, has said it is still looking for deals.  A spokesman for Sanofi declined to comment on the company’s possible interest in Actelion. While the patent for Actelion’s PAH blockbuster Tracleer expired last year, Clozel’s two newer PAH drugs, Opsumit and Uptravi, are expected to take up the slack.  Opsumit’s annual sales are set to hit 1.9 billion francs by 2020, according to Reuters data. Uptravi sales could top 2.5 billion francs. Clozel plans to use the cash to fund his late-stage pipeline, which includes medicines for treating diarrhea-causing clostridium difficile, as well as the multiple sclerosis drug ponesimod. Stefan Schneider, a Bank Vontobel analyst in Zurich, doubts a deal will go through and said any sign that a potential buyer will tinker with Clozel’s prized pipeline to cut costs could be a deal killer.  “We don’t see how the CEO would part from the pipeline where he sees the value for Actelion to transform into the first European large-cap biotech company,” Schneider said. Actelion’s shares have risen six-fold to nearly 190 francs since the start of 2012, just after Elliott tried to wrest control - on the grounds the company’s stock should fetch 70 francs.  As retirement edges closer, analysts said it is possible Clozel is more receptive to handing over the reins, especially if a buyer agrees to retain Actelion’s presence in Basel where the company, however successful, still plays second fiddle to giants Roche and Novartis. “Actelion’s shares have risen 400 percent based on the strength of the PAH portfolio alone,” Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath said.  “Even when Clozel has always made the case for independence, it’s possible a stock price at its zenith, combined with his 61 years, could prompt a change of heart.”  ($1 = 1.0139 Swiss francs) ",11282016,http://www.reuters.com/article/actelion-johnsonjohnson-ma/actelions-ambitious-independent-minded-ceo-will-drive-up-takeover-price-idUSL8N1DT1O5

999,JNJ,J&J; raises Actelion takeover pressure with higher price: source,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson has raised its offer for Actelion, a source told Reuters on Tuesday, stepping up pressure on the Swiss biotech firm to accept a takeover deal. J&J; had increased its offer, which has not yet been made public, after nearly two months of informal talks which have so far not resulted in a deal, the source added. The main stumbling block is that Actelion wants J&J; to become a major shareholder in a new entity combining the Swiss group with some of J&J;’s activities, whereas the U.S. company wants a straightforward takeover, the source said. Actelion shares closed up 10 percent at 209 Swiss francs, just off a record high, following news of the higher offer. J&J; has become one of the world’s biggest healthcare companies through hundreds of acquisitions, in which it has nearly always bought entire companies or drugs outright. Actelion co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel has fended off previous attempts to wrest the Swiss firm from him, including a reported takeover approach by Shire last year and an activist campaign in 2011 by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Advisors. Clozel and his wife Martine, who is Actelion’s chief scientific officer, founded the business in 1997. They have been trying to expand its portfolio, which consists of three main drugs focused on treating PAH, a deadly buildup of pressure in blood vessels between the heart and lungs.  Earlier, Bloomberg News reported that Actelion had rejected an offer of 246 francs per share, valuing the Swiss company at around 26.5 billion Swiss francs ($26 billion). The Clozels, both physicians who worked at Roche before setting up Actelion, still own more than 3 percent of its shares.  Recent pharma deals have commanded significant premiums, with Pfizer paying $14 billion for cancer specialist Medivation, double its pre-deal value. Actelion, whose rare-disease focus makes it an attractive target because its drugs face less price pressure than more widely used medicines, was not available for comment.  A spokesman for Johnson & Johnson declined to comment.  The companies had confirmed last week they were in talks about a possible transaction. Citigroup is advising J&J;, while Bank of America is working with Actelion, two sources said. Both banks declined to comment.  Acquiring the Swiss company would boost J&J;’s drug pipeline and diversify its prospects. Its biggest product, the arthritis drug Remicade, faces cheaper competition from Pfizer Inc.. Actelion is also growing. Although its blockbuster Tracleer’s patent has expired, its new treatment Opsumit’s annual sales are set to hit 1.9 billion francs by 2020, according to Reuters data, while just-introduced Uptravi sales could top 2.5 billion francs. The talks between the two companies began in October, the first source said. The companies had originally discussed a transaction without a big premium, focusing on some form of share deal or an asset swap, the source said. John Rountree, director with London-based consultancy Novasecta, said a structured transaction allowing Actelion to benefit from J&J;’s scale without losing its independence could work for both sides. One option might be for J&J; to mimic Roche, which bought 60 percent of Genentech in 1990, leaving it to operate independently, before acquiring the rest of the biotech in 2009.

1004,JNJ,Rejecting J&J; could leave Actelion with 'lot of explaining to do',"ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - Some Actelion shareholders would be attracted by a $27 billion bid for the Swiss biotech company from Johnson & Johnson, leaving Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel with some explaining to do if he turned down an offer around that level.  One source familiar with the matter has told Reuters the two companies are discussing a bid close to that price, or 250 Swiss francs per share.  That would be a 60 percent premium to Actelion’s market value before the companies confirmed last week they were in talks, and tempting for shareholders who would prefer to cash in now rather than bet on an uncertain future. “If I look at the (drugs) pipeline that Mr. Clozel is excited about, I am perhaps less excited about it and see perhaps a greater risk than reward,” said Eleanor Taylor Jolidon, a fund manager at Union Bancaire Privee in Geneva, which is among the top 40 investors in Actelion and holds 0.23 percent of outstanding shares, according to Reuters data. An offer around 250 francs per share would be “something we could start looking at”, Taylor Jolidon said. Should Clozel reject such a price, she added, “he would have a lot of explaining to do.”  Clozel has, in the past, guarded Actelion’s independence, helped by fellow shareholder Swiss billionaire Rudolf Maag and a  supportive Swiss investor base. In 2011, for example, he fended off a campaign by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Advisors to put the company up for sale. At the time, Elliott suggested Actelion was worth 70 francs per share, about a third of its current price.  And in 2015, Clozel reportedly saw off bid interest from British drugmaker Shire. The source familiar with the matter said Johnson & Johnson (J&J;) had increased its offer - which has not yet been made public - after nearly two months of informal talks.  The main stumbling block is Actelion wants J&J; to become a major shareholder in a new entity, while the U.S. firm favors a straightforward takeover, the source added. Citigroup is advising J&J;, while Bank of America is working with Actelion, two sources said.  Both banks and firms have declined to comment on the talks. Since Actelion’s founding in 1997, Clozel and his wife, Chief Scientific Officer Martine Clozel, have built up a world-leading drug portfolio to treat deadly pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and have been lauded for building Europe’s biggest biotech from scratch.  They aim to expand in drugs for multiple sclerosis and diarrhea-causing clostridium difficile, but regulatory approvals for those are years away. The company is also counting on its new PAH treatments Opsumit and Uptravi, which combined are forecast to bring in nearly 4.5 billion francs ($4.4 billion) in annual sales by 2020, according to Reuters data. The 61-year-old CEO and Maag together own just over 8.5 percent of Actelion stock. Some investors think J&J; has timed its approach well.  “At this juncture and at his age, Mr. Clozel might be willing to consider new opportunities for Actelion,” said Alexandre Stucki of AS Investment Management in Geneva, who owns Actelion stock in a portfolio worth “several hundred million Swiss francs”. “If J&J; is willing to offer 200 francs or more per share, they probably see good value in the pipeline as well.” Another investor, who declined to be named, said that if J&J; offered 250-270 francs per share, Actelion would “have to sell.” At 1405 GMT (09:05 a.m. EDT), the stock was down 2.3 percent at 204.3 francs. An offer that values the company at nearly $10 billion more than it was worth just last week could cause even Clozel loyalists to jump ship, given questions about its pipeline. “At the right price, Actelion management might have to engage with a deal – or will face having to justify to shareholders why the long-term direction is more valuable in their hands,” Barclays analyst Olivia Capra wrote.

1005,JNJ,Actelion's silence has hedge funds betting big on J&J; deal,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Actelion’s silence speaks volumes to the dozens of event-driven hedge funds piling into the Swiss biotech firm, betting that Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J;) (JNJ.N) approach will result in an outright takeover and handsome returns.  A source familiar with the matter has told Reuters the two companies are discussing a bid of close to $27 billion, or 250 Swiss francs ($248) per share, which is 25 percent above Actelion’s current share price.  Both companies have confirmed that U.S. diversified healthcare group J&J; - maker of Pizbuin sun screen, surgical tools and arthritis drug Remicade - has approached Actelion about a potential takeover, but kept mum on details.  Co-founder and Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel and fellow shareholder Rudolf Maag have in the past been outspoken defenders of an independent Actelion, which has built a $2 billion business by focusing on a debilitating lung disease.  But they have made no public comment since the companies confirmed the talks a week ago, and Clozel would have some explaining to do if he rejected an offer with such a big premium, fund managers with a more conventional investment approach told Reuters. “This time it’s different. It has not been outright rejected. That’s an indication that you can go a little bit bigger,” said Michael Wegener, managing partner at Hong Kong-based event-driven hedge fund Case Equity Partners. He has staked 1 percent of his fund’s net assets under management on Actelion, but did not disclose the size of his assets, and is prepared to stock up if J&J; tables a more detailed takeover proposal. “We don’t think Clozel is going to fight,” said another hedge fund manager, who asked not to be named.  Clozel holds about 5 percent in the biotech firm, according to its annual report, while his wife Martine Clozel, co-founder and chief scientific officer, also owns an undisclosed stake. No detailed data is available on share purchases by event-driven funds - who typically go after deal targets available for a discount to a mooted takeover offer - but Reuters journalists have been in contact with scores of fund managers who have discussed their tactics. Daily turnover in Actelion shares has on average jumped more than fourfold since media reports of a J&J; approach emerged on Nov. 24, from their three-month average.  The shares were trading at 200 francs as of 1603 GMT on Friday, up 27 percent since Nov. 24.  FACE-SAVING OFFER Many investors are counting on J&J; to structure a deal that would grant shareholders a cash payout and award Clozel a face-saving departure that honors the value of the firm’s development pipeline of experimental drugs.  Some analysts argue J&J;, or any rival suitor, will pay up for Actelion’s launched products - two new drugs alone are seen generating combined peak sales of well above $4 billion - but have little appreciation for its drug development projects.  Analysts at brokerage Brian Garnier on Friday suggested Clozel could be offered to keep control of the experimental drugs portfolio and cash in on the rest.   “A stand-alone Actelion going forward would therefore consist of a pipeline company with limited or no revenues.”  Rudolf Maag, another linchpin investor, who according to Thomson Reuters data holds 5.1 percent, has previous ties to J&J;: he made much of his near $2 billion fortune when he sold his stake in medical device maker Synthes-Stratec to J&J; four years ago. Maag declined to comment this week, a departure from five years ago when he and Clozel defended Actelion against an attempt by U.S.-based hedge fund Elliott Advisors to get the biotech firm to put itself up for auction. Hedge funds see Maag playing a critical role in a J&J; deal, potentially persuading Clozel the offer is too good for shareholders to pass up. “We are monitoring the situation very actively,” said one hedge fund manager, speaking on condition of anonymity.  “I would strongly assume pretty much every other event-driven fund in the world is doing the same. I have heard of event-driven funds who already have several $100 million worth of stock.” ",12022016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-actelion-m-a-hedgefunds/actelions-silence-has-hedge-funds-betting-big-on-jj-deal-idUSKBN13R22F
1006,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson hit with over $1 billion verdict on hip implants,"(Reuters) - A federal jury in Dallas on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay more than $1 billion to six plaintiffs who said they were injured by Pinnacle hip implants. The jurors found that the metal-on-metal Pinnacle hip implants were defectively designed and that the companies failed to warn consumers about the risks. J&J;, which faces more than 8,000 lawsuits over the hip implants, said in a statement it would immediately appeal the verdict and was committed to defending itself and DePuy from further litigation over the Pinnacle devices. The six plaintiffs awarded more than $1 billion are California residents who were implanted with the hip devices and experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries they attributed to design flaws. Plaintiffs claimed the companies promoted the devices as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials. Both companies denied any wrongdoing stemming from the development and marketing of the devices. According to plaintiff’s lawyer Mark Lanier, the total verdict of $1.041 billion included $32 million in compensatory damages. The rest were punitive damages. Verdicts of such size are often scaled back by courts. In July, the judge presiding over this case, U.S. District Judge Edward Kinkeade, reduced a $500 million verdict in an earlier Pinnacle implant case to $151 million, citing a Texas state law that limits punitive damages awards. J&J; and DePuy have been hit with nearly 8,400 lawsuits over the devices, which have been consolidated in Texas federal court. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims. The verdict on Thursday came in the third test case, with the second producing the earlier $500 million verdict. J&J; and DePuy were cleared of liability in the first test case in 2014  Lanier said Thursday’s verdict was “a message loud and clear” that J&J; has “a really nasty part of their business they need to clean up.”  The company rejected a $1.8 million settlement offer from the plaintiffs before trial, Lanier said. The plaintiffs in the second test case have appealed Kinkeade’s decision to cut the award. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have also appealed the jury verdict in the case. In its statement, J&J; criticized the trial judge over certain rulings it claimed help the plaintiffs.  “Today’s verdict provides no guidance on the merits of the overall Pinnacle litigation because the court’s rulings precluded a fair presentation to the jury,” said John Beisner, J&J;’s attorney. He said the company will ask the appeals court to postpone any additional trials over the implant defects. DePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations.  J&J; and DePuy also paid $2.5 billion that year to settle more than 7,000 lawsuits over its ASR metal-on-metal hip devices. The ASR devices were recalled in 2010 due to high failure rates.

1007,JNJ,Top Actelion shareholder says backs J&J; deal above 246 Sfr/share,"LONDON (Reuters) - A top-30 investor in Swiss pharmaceutical company Actelion ATLN.S said he would back a takeover approach for the whole company from U.S. rival Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) above 246 Swiss francs.  Actelion confirmed it was in talks with J&J; on Nov. 25, without giving details. Media reports suggested an initial bid of 246 Swiss francs had been rejected, while subsequent reports have suggested a revised bid of around 250 Swiss francs and the potential for rival companies to also table an offer. “If J&J; is willing to consider a price higher than the one which has been quoted in the press as an initial offer, it could be a fair price for a straightforward acquisition of the business,” the investor said. “However, a more complex deal, involving a partial combination would not be beneficial for the remaining Actelion shareholders.” A tie-up with J&J; could also represent a “win-win” for Actelion’s shareholders and employees, the investor said, as J&J; had a good track record of giving its research and development operations “freedom to innovate”.

1008,JNJ,Trump's corporate tax holiday could spur pharma M&A;,"(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s plan to incentivize U.S. companies to repatriate their swelling overseas cash piles could spur a new wave of dealmaking in a pharmaceutical industry seeking to buy its way into growth. For years, big U.S. drugmakers have turned to acquisitions of foreign companies to put their overseas cash to work, rather than bring it home at a 35-percent tax rate. Trump has proposed allowing repatriation of this cash at a 10-percent tax rate, hoping some of it will be spent on hiring and investing in their businesses. However, drugmakers are much more likely to spend this money on acquisitions that could revive their drug development pipeline by acquiring smaller peers with promising offerings, as opposed to risking more of their own dollars on research and development, corporate executives and dealmakers say.  Some of these deals could even result in job cuts as companies seek to eliminate overlaps.      “Would we consider to repatriate the cash? I would say yes, and what we would look at would be first to maintain the lowest weighted average cost of capital for the company,” Amgen Inc chief financial officer David Meline told analysts and investors on the company’s most recent earnings call in October. “Then we would look at certainly deploying cash towards external opportunities, but in that instance we would certainly lead with other strategic opportunities that make sense where we could get a return for our own shareholders from such investments.” Trump’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment on the potential impact of his proposed tax holiday on the drug industry.    Corporate America had $1.3 trillion, or 74 percent of its total cash, stashed overseas in 2016, according to Moody’s Investors Service Inc. That’s up from an estimated $1.2 trillion, or 72 percent of total cash, a year earlier.     While the top five overseas cash holders are technology companies such as Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, the pharmaceutical industry accounts for a big chunk of that cash.      The five U.S. pharmaceutical companies with the largest cash piles, namely Pfizer Inc, Merck & Co, Johnson & Johnson, Amgen and Eli Lilly and Co, hold nearly $250 billion in overseas funds, according to data from U.S. non-profit research and advocacy group Citizens for Tax Justice.  At the same time, big pharma is in hot pursuit of the next blockbuster drug. Many of the industry’s most successful franchises, from Gilead’s Hepatitis C cure and Biogen Inc’s multiple sclerosis treatments, to AbbVie Inc’s arthritis drug Humira, are all bracing for declining revenues as patents age and competition heats up.       Valuations of biotechnology companies that could be acquisition targets for major drug firms are still hovering near historic lows after being dragged down by election-season political criticism of high drug prices.     “Tax repatriation is a more likely situation now, benefiting large biotechs and (pharmaceutical companies) with significant offshore cash and a desire to buy mid-cap companies,” RBC Capital equity analyst Michael Yee wrote in a research note.    The last time tax considerations fueled a wave of dealmaking in the pharmaceutical industry was in 2014, when companies sought to redomicile abroad through acquisitions, referred to as corporate inversions. But U.S. President Barack Obama subsequently announced curbs to limit inversions, culminating in Pfizer abandoning its $160-billion agreement to acquire Allergan Plc, the biggest attempted merger of all time.      Pharmaceutical M&A; involving U.S. companies has been around $90 billion year-to-date, down from nearly $270 billion the year before.         Executives at Pfizer, which has already said it is looking to do more deals after its $14-billion acquisition of cancer drugmaker Medivation Inc, have told investors in private meetings that its M&A; appetite would grow even bigger if it could bring home its more than $70 billion in overseas cash, according to people familiar with the matter.      Pfizer could potentially use its newfound firepower to buy a company as large as Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, a $92-billion market capitalization cancer drugmaker that fueled takeover speculation after a disappointing drug trial in August sent its stock down more than 25 percent.     Bristol-Myers Squibb’s blockbuster cancer drug Opdivo could compliment Pfizer’s plan to become a leader in immuno-oncology, which seeks to use the body’s own defenses to treat cancer, industry bankers said, without suggesting that any deal is in the works.     Pfizer declined to comment, while Bristol-Myers Squibb did not respond to a request for comment.     Another cancer drug company that could attract takeover interest following a cash repatriation is Incyte Corp, as it could make an attractive target for Gilead Sciences Inc if it was able to bring home its nearly $25 billion in overseas cash, bankers said.      Gilead has been under pressure to find a new blockbuster because of declining sales from its aging Hepatitis C franchise and the recent failure in clinical trials of a cancer drug that would have competed with Incyte’s successful blood cancer drug, Jakafi.     Gilead declined comment; Incyte did not respond to a request for comment.     Beyond cancer drug makers, other biotechnology companies that could attract takeover interest include those specializing in neurology companies, such as Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc, that have promising treatments for ailments such as Alzheimer’s psychosis and migraine.      Acadia did not respond to a request for comment.     “We believe the vast majority of investors have been underweight biotech all year,” said Yee in his note. “A coiled spring of money flow may need to shift back over to biotech.” ",12062016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pharmaceuticals-m-a/trumps-corporate-tax-holiday-could-spur-pharma-ma-idUSKBN13V1D4
1009,JNJ,Sanofi exploring bid for Actelion amid J&J; talks: Bloomberg,"(Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi (SASY.PA) is considering a bid for Swiss biotech company Actelion ATLN.S, rivaling an offer made by U.S. healthcare company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), Bloomberg reported. Sanofi is working with advisers to assess its options, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. (bloom.bg/2h8qooh) Sanofi has made its interest known to Actelion but has not decided if it will proceed with a bid, added the Bloomberg report. Asked to comment on the report, a Sanofi spokeswoman said the company did not comment on market speculation, while Actelion also declined to comment on the situation. Actelion shares were seen opening up by around 4 percent, according to traders’ pre-market indications. To gauge potential interest for Actelion, advisers have also reached out to other drugmakers including Switzerland’s Roche Holding AG (ROG.S) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the Bloomberg report said. J&J; said last month it was in preliminary talks with Actelion about a takeover of Europe’s largest biotech firm, which was then valued at about $20 billion. Lung disease specialist Actelion, which confirmed the J&J; move then, had warned that there was no certainty of a deal.

1010,JNJ,"J&J; questions fairness of hip implant trial, $1 billion verdict","(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) will challenge the fairness of a trial that produced a verdict of $1 billion in damages against the company last week over allegations of design flaws in its  Pinnacle hip implant. Although legal experts think J&J; faces an uphill battle, both they and investors believe the Texas jury’s penalty, the largest product liability verdict so far this year, is unlikely to stand. In the two-month trial, five separate people from California argued that design flaws in the metal-on-metal implant made by J&J; subsidiary DePuy Orthopaedics caused tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries. It is the second large verdict against J&J; in the Pinnacle implant litigation, which has been consolidated before U.S. District Court Judge Edward Kinkeade in Texas. In July, another jury awarded six Texas plaintiffs $500 million. Both cases were so-called bellwethers, intended to gauge the value of claims for more than 9,000 other pending implant cases. J&J; said in a statement it was confident in its appeal prospects and would not settle. It also said it stood by the safety of its product. Last Thursday’s verdict has had little impact on J&J; stock. Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager with ESquared Asset Management, said investors assume large health products companies will occasionally be sued and lose and that the costs are ultimately manageable. J&J; said it will ask Kinkeade to reduce or throw out the jury award before appealing to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. According to the company, the multi-plaintiff format stacked the deck against it by parading a series of victims in front of the jury and exaggerating the number of complaints about the implant.  The company won the first bellwether trial in a case involving a single plaintiff in 2014. The next is scheduled for September 2017, and Kinkeade has not decided how many plaintiffs will be involved in that trial. These results “perfectly illustrate the distortions and confusion inherent in multi-plaintiff trials and underscore the extent of the legal errors that have been repeated,” said J&J; defense lawyer John Beisner. But several legal experts said such a challenge faced long odds. Lynn Baker, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, noted trial judges are normally given great leeway in managing their cases and multi-plaintiff trials were a long-established means of clearing dockets faster. “I would not expect J&J; to succeed on a claim that they were prejudiced by the multi-plaintiff bellwether format,” she said. J&J; also said the judge allowed plaintiffs’ lawyers to present inflammatory and prejudicial testimony to the juries, raising bribery accusations against the company and claims that the metal-on-metal implants could cause cancer.  University of Richmond School of Law Professor Carl Tobias said an appeals court was unlikely to overturn the verdict on such grounds though. “Unless there is clear prejudice on the part of the jury, you’ve got to defer to the factfinder,” he said. But even without showing its trial was unfair, the professors said J&J;’s case was strong for having the $1 billion award reduced on the grounds that it is excessive.  Kinkeade cut the $500 million July verdict to $151 million. Andrew Bradt, a professor at University of California Berkeley School of Law, noted the U.S. Supreme Court has held punitive damages should be no more than 10 times compensatory damages. The $1.041 billion award was mainly punitive, with just $32 million in compensatory damages. Bradt said the final award could be even lower than $320 million, since the high court has also said punitive damages awards should be closely tied to plaintiffs’ injuries rather than as a broader deterrent.

1013,JNJ,Actelion talking to Sanofi after J&J; exit,"ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - Switzerland’s Actelion Ltd ATLN.S is in talks with French drugmaker Sanofi (SASY.PA) about a deal, sources said on Wednesday, after U.S. healthcare group Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) abandoned efforts to buy the company. Two people familiar with the situation said discussions were advanced but a deal was not assured. Actelion’s shares ended 9 percent lower on investor concern that J&J;’s exit underlined the challenges facing any bidder for Europe’s biggest biotech group.  One option under consideration is for Sanofi to give shareholders a so-called contingent value right (CVR) on top of cash. The CVR would pay out if certain Actelion drugs live up to commercial expectations. Sanofi, which also provided a tradable CVR when it bought U.S. rare diseases firm Genzyme for $20 billion in 2011, declined to comment. Sources said Roche was closely monitoring developments and might yet step in, if talks with Sanofi foundered. A Roche spokesman declined to comment.  Sanofi was trumped in August by Pfizer’s (PFE.N) $14 billion bid for U.S. cancer drug company Medivation and is still eager for deals to broaden its drug line-up. However, analysts said Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt could ill afford to fail in a second high-profile bid. Actelion told J&J; it was confident it could attract an offer significantly higher than the approximately 250 Swiss francs per share the U.S. company had offered, according to one person familiar with the matter. There were also disagreements about the proposed deal’s structure, the person added. Actelion shares had closed at 208.50 Swiss francs on Tuesday, a 25 percent premium to their price before J&J;’s bid became public two weeks and giving the company a market capitalization of 22.5 billion Swiss francs ($22.2 billion). “I presume these parties are prepared to make offers that are more attractive than that which J&J; was envisaging,” said Eleanor Taylor Jolidon, a fund manager at Union Bancaire Privee in Geneva, which is among Actelion’s top 40 investors.  “Otherwise, the board of directors would not have acted in the interests of the stakeholders by creating a situation in which J&J; walked away.”  The Swiss company, founded by its CEO Jean-Paul Clozel in 1997, confirmed talks over a “possible strategic transaction” but did not name the counterparty. A spokesman declined further comment but sources with knowledge of the matter identified Sanofi.  Analysts have previously named Sanofi as a potential buyer for Actelion, whose portfolio of drugs against deadly pulmonary arterial hypertension — elevated pressure in arteries connecting the heart and lungs — would supplement Sanofi’s Genzyme unit.  Even so, a competitive auction could drive up its price to unrealistic levels. “Winning a bidding war when it comes to acquiring biopharmaceutical companies almost always equates to way over-paying,” wrote Tim Anderson, an Bernstein analyst.  “These are not bragging rights,” he said. “If Actelion were to go out at around $30 billion, this equates to around 13 times sales and 30 times earnings before interest and taxes. These are high figures.”   Clozel, who worked for Roche for 12 years before founding Actelion, and his wife, Chief Scientific Officer Martine Clozel, have built up a world-leading drug portfolio at Actelion to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension. The Clozels aim to expand in drugs for multiple sclerosis and clostridium difficile, but regulatory approvals for those are years away. The company is also counting on its new pulmonary arterial hypertension treatments Opsumit and Uptravi, which combined are forecast to bring in nearly 4.5 billion francs in annual sales by 2020. Clozel has rebuffed past pressure from some shareholders to do a deal, maintaining Actelion is better off staying independent. Five years ago, he successfully fended off an effort by activist hedge fund Elliott Management to put Actelion up for sale.

Actelion said in a brief statement on Wednesday it was in exclusive negotiations with the U.S. healthcare giant but that there could be “no assurance any transaction will result from these discussions”, declining to comment further.  J&J; confirmed the talks in a separate statement. The announcement could dash the hopes of French drugmaker Sanofi, which sources have said has been circling Actelion after J&J; a little over a week ago said it had ended discussions with Actelion.

The French company has signaled it remained keen to make a takeover deal after being trumped in August by Pfizer’s (PFE.N) $14 billion bid for U.S. cancer drug company Medivation.  Sanofi declined to comment on Wednesday. Actelion had a market value of 23.2 billion Swiss francs  ($22.6 billion) at Wednesday’s closing price of 215 Swiss francs in Switzerland.

1015,JNJ,Exclusive: J&J; discussing breaking up Actelion in an acquisition - sources,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) is negotiating a deal to acquire Swiss biotechnology company Actelion Ltd ATLN.S that would separate its commercialized portfolio from its research and development assets, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The deal structure would allow J&J; to acquire Actelion with a cash offer in the region of $260 per share, a little more than what it had offered when it walked away from negotiations earlier this month. It also would allow Actelion shareholders to benefit financially from Actelion’s R&D; pipeline, the people said. Under the deal being discussed, Actelion’s R&D; pipeline would be placed in a new publicly traded company, the people said. The exact ownership of the new company, and whether Actelion Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel would head it, are among the details still being negotiated, the people said. A deal could be finalized by late January, they said, cautioning that negotiations could still end unsuccessfully. The sources asked not to be identified because the details are confidential. J&J; and Actelion declined to comment. Actelion shares ended trading in Zurich on Thursday near  flat at 229.90 Swiss Francs ($224.6), giving the company a market capitalization of $23.5 billion. J&J; shares were up 0.5 percent at $115.62, giving it a market capitalization of $315 billion. Actelion said last week it had entered into exclusive talks with J&J; about a strategic transaction. J&J; had pulled out of negotiations with Actelion over price disagreements earlier this month, temporarily allowing France’s Sanofi SA (SASY.PA) to engage in one-on-one acquisition talks with Actelion.

1016,JNJ,Judge halves $1 billion award in J&J; hip implants case,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge almost halved the award in a December jury verdict that ordered Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay more than $1 billion to plaintiffs in six lawsuits who said they were injured by DePuy’s Pinnacle hip implants. U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade in Dallas cited “constitutional considerations” that limit how much plaintiffs may recover in punitive damages but upheld the jury’s findings that the implants were defectively designed and that the companies failed to warn consumers about the risks. Around $500 million of punitive damages would be cut from the more than $1 billion awarded to the plaintiffs who are California residents that were implanted with the hip devices and experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries they attributed to design flaws. The complainants claimed the companies promoted the implants as lasting longer than devices that include ceramic or plastic materials. DePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its regulations on artificial hips.

1020,JNJ,UPDATE 2-Japan's Takeda ready for fresh acquisitions after $5.2 bln Ariad deal,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co (4502.T) flagged its appetite for fresh acquisitions to bolster its drug portfolio after agreeing on Monday to acquire cancer drug maker Ariad Pharmaceuticals ARIA.O in a $5.20 billion deal.  The Ariad transaction, at a 75 percent premium, is the latest example of the world’s pharmaceutical giants paying handsomely to snap up promising drugs owned by rivals in a bid to secure stable revenue growth particularly in the burgeoning therapeutic markets such as treatments for cancer or rare diseases Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) agreed in August to pay $14 billion for Medivation Inc, the maker of the $2.2 billion-a-year cancer drug Xtandi. In 2015, AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) forked out $21 billion for Pharmacyclics, giving it ownership with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) of blockbuster leukemia drug Imbruvica. Takeda’s move comes as it readies to fend off imminent generic competition for its top-selling blood cancer drug Velcade, with other key products slated to go off patent later from 2020.  Its Chief Financial Officer James Kehoe said that sound finances would keep the Japanese company in that hunt for potential hit drugs. “Should the right deal come along we have the capacity,”  Kehoe said during a conference call after Takeda announced the Ariad purchase. The company was in a position to limit its debt burden and retain a strong credit rating, he said. At the end of its last business year that ended on March 31, Takeda had 438 billion yen ($3.79 billion) in cash and cash equivalents. Takeda’s Chief Executive Officer Christophe Weber said on the same call that while there were not many opportunities to buy cancer drugs and central nervous system drugs, such as Alzheimer remedies and bipolar treatments, the company, nevertheless, would make acquisitions “that make sense”. Weber said the potential returns from Ariad’s lung cancer treatment, Brigatinib, and its leukemia drug, Iclusig, along with other formulas in its pipeline justified the high premium. Takeda predicts annual sales from Brigatinib, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide on by April, could exceed $1 billion. “It has the potential to be the best in class,” Weber said. Both Brigatinib and Iclusig, however, face tough competition, according to MorganStanley MUFG’s pharmaceutical analyst, Shinichiro Muraoka. “Ariad’s new drugs are in the third-fourth order groups in the market, so the competitive edge is not that high. Whether the premium of over 70 percent for the acquisition is justified depends on synergies ahead,” Muraoka said in a note following the announcement. Takeda's shares gained 0.2 percent to 4,966 yen in Tokyo on Tuesday compared with a 0.5 percent dip in the benchmark Nikkei 225 index .N225.

1027,JNJ,INSIGHT-Sanofi's M&A; misses frustrate some investors in drugmaker,"PARIS/DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - For the last year, Sanofi’s chief executive has made clear his quest for deals to help revive the fortunes of France’s biggest drugmaker. The market is still waiting. Olivier Brandicourt’s failure to land two big biotech acquisitions he was chasing has led to growing impatience among some investors. “The company needs a growth driver and must make an acquisition. Time is running out,” said Olivier David of Vega Investment Managers, who holds shares in the company. In an interview at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos this week Brandicourt defended his track record, citing an unwillingness to overpay for pricey assets and a paucity of good opportunities. “We can grow without M&A.; However, it is a tool which we do continue to consider and which can help growth potentially, only if it makes sense strategically,” he said. “The reason why it is so competitive is that you don’t have a very, very large number of potential targets.”  Sanofi’s misses underscore the race for assets as the world’s top drugmakers try to replenish their medicine cabinets. After entering exclusive talks, Johnson & Johnson appears to be closing in on a deal to buy Actelion for some $28 billion, edging out Sanofi, which also tried to buy the Swiss company, according to people familiar with the matter. It marks a second setback for Brandicourt’s M&A; ambitions after he was beaten by Pfizer’s $14 billion bid for U.S. cancer specialist Medivation last August. Brandicourt said he had to tread a fine line between delivering and overpaying, arguing many shareholders appreciated the financial discipline needed to walk away from deals. “Shareholders being frustrated after one year is not automatically what I’m hearing, to be honest, because when I see investors they seem to be very happy for us not to have spent $14 billion on Medivation,” he said. “On Actelion, I’m not making any comment but you will understand that a company like ours will continuously look at what’s happening in the world of potential mergers and acquisitions.” The global pharmaceutical industry has seen a flurry of acquisitions in recent years as leading players build their drug pipelines by snapping up young biotech firms.  Sanofi has a particular need to do this because its core U.S. diabetes business has stalled. Brandicourt - who joined the company in April 2015 after the ousting of former CEO Chris Viehbacher - insisted Sanofi was delivering effectively on a plan set out to 2020. The drugmaker posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings in October, helped by a surge in flu vaccine sales, but it stuck to its guidance for currency-adjusted sales at its embattled diabetes business to shrink by 4-8 percent per year on average from 2015 to 2018. Despite a rally since October, over the last five years Sanofi shares have lagged the sector, rising around 37 percent, against a 61 percent gain for the STOXX Europe 600 Healthcare index. “A lot of fund managers and historic shareholders are fed up with Sanofi and tired of seeing the stock in this ‘vegetative’ state,” said Frederic Rozier, a Sanofi investor and fund manager with Meeschaert. “Cost cutting is not enough, we want to see growth in sales, that’s where we need to see progress.”        “CONSTANT SCREENING MODE”   Sanofi is due to publish annual results on Feb. 8 and its 2016 financial performance is expected to hinge on cost savings. The fear is that with few potential new blockbusters in development, with the notable exception of dupilumab for eczema and asthma, Sanofi may find itself stuck with no meaningful growth for a while. “Sanofi is looking for a pipeline and for this very reason it must engage in external growth,” said Rudi Van den Eynde, with asset management firm Candriam. “At the moment, the company is being overtaken by other groups that are offering more money. One can applaud that Sanofi is financially disciplined but it is a pity that it misses its targets ... it doesn’t help in terms of credibility.” Sanofi’s failure to land either Medivation or Actelion has raised questions over its acquisition strategy, even as the group insists it is in “constant screening mode”. “Is Sanofi not too rigid when it comes to pricing? At the end, they lose to someone else,” said a Paris-based banker who asked not to be identified. Another banking source said Sanofi’s hostile approach in the Medivation process had been a mistake. Weeks before losing out to Pfizer, Sanofi tried to oust Medivation’s board members to replace them with new directors. “Everyone knows that 95 percent of hostile approaches go wrong,” the source said, adding that in the final stage Pfizer and Sanofi were only a few hundred millions apart. Brandicourt said he simply stuck to his guns on price and he noted that Sanofi, with a relatively small oncology business, may have had fewer potential cost savings than competitors. Sanofi has signaled its readiness to do deals of a similar size to its $20 billion purchase of Genzyme in 2011 but finding the right large biotech to fit is not that easy. “Alternatively, Sanofi could purchase smaller companies, along the lines of the strategy pursued by Japan’s Takeda. It would be more realistic,” Van den Eynde said. Sanofi may also look at more asset swaps, after agreeing to hand its animal unit to Boehringer Ingelheim in exchange for the German firm’s consumer healthcare operations, a business strand it is keen to grow. “A number of healthcare companies are looking at Pfizer’s consumer health unit. Sanofi is one of them,” said one healthcare banker. A Sanofi spokesman declined to comment.

1028,JNJ,UPDATE 3-Actelion drug setback unlikely to derail J&J; talks - analysts,"ZURICH (Reuters) - A blow to Actelion’s ATLN.S Opsumit drug in a test is unlikely to have an impact on talks over a strategic deal with Johnson & Johnson J&J.N;, analysts said on Monday, as the Swiss drugmaker’s shares shook off the news. Shares in Actelion were up 2.4 percent at 1040 GMT after the company said Opsumit had missed the main target in a late-stage study on patients with a deadly heart-lung ailment. Actelion had been conducting the Phase III trial on 226 patients, part of its push to expand clinical use of Opsumit for patients suffering from pulmonary arterial hypertension due to Eisenmenger Syndrome.  Patients with Eisenmenger Syndrome have untreated congenital heart defects that lead to pulmonary hypertension, where blood vessels in the lung arteries become stiff and narrow.  Opsumit is a follow-on medicine to blockbuster PAH drug Tracleer, which has lost patent protection. Missing the primary endpoint — exercise capacity as measured in a six-minute walk test — weakens Opsumit’s revenue potential by as much as 200 million Swiss francs ($200 million) per year, analysts estimated. Analysts said this would be insignificant to U.S. healthcare giant J&J;’s (JNJ.N) interest in Europe’s biggest biotech group. The two companies have held exclusive talks for weeks, although no deal has been announced. “The failure is a modest disappointment to the company’s efforts to differentiate Opsumit and protect it from price pressure,” Deutsche Bank analyst Richard Parkes said. Initially approved for PAH in 2013, Opsumit was Actelion’s second-biggest selling drug behind Tracleer in the third quarter, with sales of 218 million Swiss francs. Analysts at Jefferies also called the adverse impact “likely minor”, in part because Actelion’s older drug Tracleer is already approved in Europe to treat Eisenmenger-related PAH. While conceding Opsumit failed to reach the study’s primary objective, Actelion called its results “difficult to interpret”. “Although the results point toward a benefit of treatment with macitentan (Opsumit), we do not see a significant treatment effect on the primary endpoint of exercise capacity as measured in the 6 minute walk test,” said Nazzareno Galie, head of the Pulmonary Hypertension Center at the University of Bologna’s Institute of Cardiology. The result may have been influenced by an “unexpected improvement” in the study’s placebo arm that had not shown up in previous PAH studies, Galie said, adding that researchers must “fully analyze the data to understand what could have caused this phenomenon”.

We believe that has been our practice,” CEO Alex Gorsky said on a conference call. The company is planning to release what it is calling a pharmaceutical transparency report. It will include expanded disclosures on U.S. pricing, research and development expenses, and compassionate care programs, Gorsky said. Lack of transparency in how companies price medicines has been a major sore point among industry critics. Gorsky was among business leaders who met with Trump on Monday in Washington, and on Tuesday outlined his priorities, including lower taxes to help U.S. companies better compete with overseas rivals and being allowed to bring back cash held abroad at a lower tax rate.  With Congress and Trump determined to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Gorsky said he hoped any new plan would retain health coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. He would also like to see a continued move toward value-based care and a focus on wellness and preventive care. J&J; said it did not see a significant business uptick as a result of former President Barack Obama’s health care law, commonly referred to as Obamacare, and does not expect changes to have a negative effect. It said current fees and costs associated with the law were included in its 2017 forecasts. J&J; forecast 2017 adjusted earnings of $6.93 to $7.08 per share on revenue of $74.1 billion to $74.8 billion, below the average analyst estimate for a profit of $7.11 per share on revenue of $75.10 billion. “We think the outlook reflects a degree of conservatism rather than a reflection of caution on fundamentals,” Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham said in a research note. The company said it expected a slower growth rate for pharmaceuticals this year. Gorsky declined to comment on J&J;’s exclusive talks to buy Actelion Ltd ATLN.S, Europe’s biggest biotech, but said the  $4.3 billion acquisition of Abbott Laboratories’ (ABT.N) eye-care business would likely close this quarter.

1034,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson refills drug cabinet with $30 billion Actelion deal,"ALLSCHWIL, Switzerland (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) will buy Swiss biotech company Actelion ATLN.S in a $30 billion all-cash deal that includes spinning off Actelion’s research and development pipeline, the companies said on Thursday. The biggest European drugs takeover in 13 years gives J&J; access to the Swiss group’s range of high-price, high-margin medicines for rare diseases, helping it diversify its drug portfolio as its biggest product,  Remicade for arthritis, faces cheaper competition.  The offer to pay $280 per share, following weeks of exclusive talks, was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. The deal represents a 23 percent premium to Actelion’s closing price on Wednesday and is more than 80 percent above the Nov. 23 closing price before reports emerged that Europe’s biggest biotech company had attracted takeover interest. Actelion shares jumped 20 percent to 273.30 francs by 1350 GMT as investors welcomed the deal. “The structure is very attractive,” said Eleanor Taylor Jolidon, a fund manager at Union Bancaire Privee in Geneva, a top-40 Actelion investor. The price vindicates the strategy of cardiologist Jean-Paul Clozel, who co-founded the company with his pediatrician wife Martine and friends in 1997, and has fended off bids over the years in the belief he could increase Actelion’s value by keeping it independent. “The price is quite high at around 30 times price to estimated 2018 earnings. J&J; is paying a lot and R&D; is not even included, just a substantial minority stake,” one Zurich-based trader said. “But it represents only 10 percent of (J&J;’s) market capitalization and they are finally investing the cash they hold in Europe.”  Jefferies analysts said they did not expect any counterbids or competition concerns, while Berenberg analysts called it “a fantastic deal for Actelion and its shareholders” given concerns about the long-term growth prospects for its main products. Actelion has been the subject of takeover speculation for weeks after J&J; launched and then halted discussions with the Swiss company. French drugmaker Sanofi (SASY.PA) had also been interested, sources said, but was sidelined after J&J; returned and began exclusive negotiations in December. Sanofi’s failure to come away with a big deal for a second time has added to pressure on its management. Clozel said the J&J; offer — putting Actelion’s established drugs into its bigger commercial organization while leaving riskier early-stage R&D; assets in the new 600-employee company for Clozel to develop — convinced him this was the right one. “With this structure it was not difficult,” he told Reuters after a news conference. “It’s always emotional but it’s not difficult. Because frankly it’s a good solution for everybody.”   The deal makes the Clozels billionaires.    J&J; said it expected the transaction to be immediately accretive to its adjusted earnings per share and accelerate its revenue and earnings growth rates although synergies were set to play just a small role.  The U.S. group, which reported disappointing quarterly results this week, will fund the transaction with cash held outside the United States. “We believe this transaction offers compelling value to both Johnson & Johnson and Actelion shareholders,” Alex Gorsky, J&J; chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. Actelion will spin out its research and development unit into a standalone company based and listed in Switzerland, under the working title of R&D; NewCo and led by Clozel. The break-up plan was first reported by Reuters last month. The shares of R&D; NewCo will be distributed to Actelion’s shareholders as a stock dividend and the new unit will be launched with 1 billion francs in cash. Urs Beck, fund manager at EFG Asset Management that holds Actelion shares, hailed the transaction. “J&J; is a good partner with a huge distribution network. For Actelion’s founders that is certainly a good solution. Mr and Ms Clozel can do research for another 20 years and J&J; has gained an interesting indication,” he said. “It’s a huge deal and J&J; plays in a different league from Sanofi, they can finance that without difficulties. I don’t see Sanofi stepping in with a higher offer at some point, that doesn’t make sense any more,” he added. J&J; will initially hold a 16 percent stake in R&D; NewCo and will have rights to an additional 16 percent of the company’s equity through a convertible note. It agreed not to sell its stake on the open market for two years.  It will also get an option on ACT-132577, a product within R&D; NewCo being developed for resistant hypertension and now in phase 2 clinical development.  Lazard acted as lead financial advisor to J&J;, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch was Actelion’s lead advisor.  The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter, with J&J; commencing the tender offer by mid-February. It needs to win at least 67 percent of all Actelion shares, regulatory approvals and Actelion shareholder approval of the distribution of shares of R&D; NewCo.

1038,JNJ,M&A; boost helps European shares stay at one-year high,"* STOXX Europe 600 index ends up 0.2 pct * Actelion surges on J&J; acquisition deal * Diageo gains after strong sales data * But results at Daily Mail, Unilever disappoint   (Adds details, closing prices) By Atul Prakash and Danilo Masoni LONDON/MILAN, Jan 26 (Reuters) - European shares held around one-year highs on Thursday, supported by mergers and acquisitions-related optimism, with Johnson & Johnson’s  $30 billion deal to buy Actelion lifting shares in the Swiss biotech firm. Actelion surged 19.4 percent after the U.S. healthcare giant’s move to make an all-cash purchase that includes spinning off Actelion’s research and development pipeline. The acquisition gives J&J; access to the Swiss group’s line-up of high-price, high-margin medicines for rare diseases. “We are likely to see more of such deals as many companies that want to merge or acquire other firms could use the current low bond yield environment to fund such initiatives,” said Christian Stocker, strategist at UniCredit in Munich. “I am very positive on European stocks in the first quarter as several sectors, in particular financials and industrials, are witnessing an increase in their earnings momentum.” The STOXX 600 added 0.2 percent, building on strong gains seen in the previous session when the pan-European index ended at its highest level since end-December 2015. Germany’s DAX rose 0.4 percent to its highest since May 2015, while UK’S FTSE ended flat. The broader market also got help from some positive earnings reports. Franco-Italian chipmaker STMicroelectronics  rose 7.6 percent after posting in-line results for the final quarter of 2016, driven by solid phone and car part sales and improved factory utilisation. Diageo, the maker of Johnnie Walker Scotch and Smirnoff vodka, rose 3.6 percent after the world’s largest distilled drinks company reported a better-than-expected rise in sales, helped by improvements in its U.S. business that boosted confidence in its future performance. “We are pleased to see Diageo doing exactly what it is meant to do: drive out organic growth from its portfolio of premium global brands, throwing off cash as it does,” said Steve Clayton, fund manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select UK Shares fund, which holds a position in Diageo. Royal Bank of Scotland added 2.4 percent as investors cheered a 3.1 billion pound ($3.9 billion) provision taken by the bank to settle claims in the United States that it mis-sold toxic mortgage-backed securities. Intrum Justitia was up 6.9 percent after the Swedish debt collector’s fourth quarter operating profits came in above market expectations. However, some companies disappointed on the earnings front, resulting in a sharp sell-off in their shares. Daily Mail and General Trust fell more than 8 percent, the top faller on the STOXX Europe 600 index, after the owner of the Daily Mail newspaper cut its revenue outlook for its Information division. It said the unit had been hit by a slowdown in the British property market. Unilever fell 4.7 percent after the consumer goods maker reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter sales growth, blaming the Indian government’s withdrawal of high-value notes and a weak economy in Brazil.

1039,JNJ,Advisers could land $100 million payday from Actelion sale,"LONDON (Reuters) - Advisers could pocket up to $100 million in fees from Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech firm Actelion ATLN.S, the largest takeover of a European healthcare business in more than a decade. Four investment banks will share the advisory pot; J&J; could cough up $30-$40 million in fees to its advisers, Lazard and Citi, while Actelion is expected to pay $45-$60 million to Bank of America and Credit Suisse, according to estimates from Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting. Lazard, which acted as lead adviser to J&J;, is set to earn the most, followed by Bank of America, which acted as Actelion’s lead adviser. The deal is the biggest takeover with a European pharma business as target since Sanofi-Synthelabo acquired rival Aventis 13 years ago to forge what is now Sanofi (SASY.PA). It ranks as the third biggest globally in any sector this year, after British American Tobacco’s (BATS.L) $49.4 billion acquisition of U.S. rival Reynolds American Inc RAI.N and a $49 billion all-share merger between Italy’s Luxottica (LUX.MI) and France’s Essilor (ESSI.PA) to create a global eyewear powerhouse. The sale of Actelion, announced on Thursday after weeks of exclusive negotiations, is yet another windfall for M&A; bankers, showing that Europe remains an attractive region for corporate deals despite uncertainty over Brexit and upcoming elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands. Global M&A; activity fell 16 percent in 2016, while acquisitions of European companies dropped 13 percent to $756 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Advisory fees attached to global M&A; deals fell 2 percent to $27 billion.

The dollar rebounded from a seven-week low as investor demand improved with higher global bond yields and stable stock markets. The return of risk appetite in the financial market boosted oil prices. MSCI’s world index, which tracks shares in 46 countries, was little changed and just 2 percent off its record high hit in April 2015. The index found support from rallying stocks in Asia and Europe. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average held well above the 20,000 level after breaching the milestone on Wednesday, buoyed by optimism over U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-growth initiatives and solid earnings. The S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq Composite hit record levels immediately after the open, before easing off their highs to trade little changed on the day. “Today is about earnings and part of the Dow reaching the 20,000 milestone is because of strong earnings,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. Of the 104 S&P; 500 companies that had reported results through Wednesday morning, nearly 70 percent beat expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Tech giants Intel, Alphabet, Microsoft  and coffee chain Starbucks are scheduled to report results after market close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 46.78 points, or 0.23 percent, to 20,115.29, the S&P; 500 gained 0.09 points, or 0.00 percent, to 2,298.46 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 1.42 points, or 0.03 percent, to 5,657.76. European shares climbed to a one-year high supported by merger and acquisition-related optimism, with Johnson & Johnson’s $30 billion deal to buy Actelion  lifting shares in the Swiss biotech firm. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.17. The dollar gained against a basket of major currencies as the greenback played catch-up with the recent rally in stocks. “The impression ... is that the Trump reflation trade may be getting back on track,” said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist, at Scotiabank in Toronto. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.67 percent to 100.7. The firmer dollar pushed gold to a two-week low but expectations that the greenback’s climb may be running out of steam helped limit losses. Spot gold was down 1.16 percent to $1,186.27 an ounce. Ahead of a $28-billion auction of seven-year notes, U.S. Treasury debt yields turned higher with European yields and 10-year yields rose to a 4-week high. Benchmark 10-year notes were down 6/32 in price to yield 2.542 percent, up from 2.523 percent late on Wednesday. The recent strength in stock markets boosted oil prices although gains were capped by plentiful supplies and bulging inventories in spite of efforts by producers to cut output. Brent crude was up 2.4 percent at $56.4 a barrel, while U.S. crude was up 2.2 percent at $53.91.

1044,JNJ,J&J; loses venue fight for talc lawsuits in Missouri,"(Reuters) - The Missouri Supreme Court has denied Johnson & Johnson’s bid to move out of a St. Louis state court thousands of lawsuits alleging the company’s talc-based products can increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The state high court on Tuesday this week rejected an appeal by J&J; (JNJ.N) seeking to transfer most of the 2,500 lawsuits pending in state court in St. Louis to courts across the country where the plaintiffs are located. The plaintiffs are women and their families who claim studies show J&J;’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower products increase the risk of ovarian cancer when used in the vaginal area. J&J; has said more comprehensive studies show no such link. St. Louis has become the main destination for talc lawsuits nationally, and J&J; has been hit with three straight jury verdicts there, totaling $195 million. The company had hoped to reverse that trend by changing the venues for the cases to potentially friendlier jurisdictions. In September, a state court judge in New Jersey, where J&J; is based, dismissed two talc lawsuits against the company. J&J; spokeswoman Carol Goodrich declined to comment on the Missouri Supreme Court’s decision. The company had argued in court filings that plaintiffs’ attorneys tainted the St. Louis jury pool by spending nearly $10 million on television commercials in the last year, with a disproportionate amount running in St. Louis. Plaintiffs’ lawyers have denied the allegation. Ted Meadows, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, said in a statement on Wednesday that the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed plaintiffs’ right to file their claims in a single location. The next trial is slated to start on Feb. 6 in St. Louis. In that case, Nora Daniels of Columbia, Tennessee, alleges she used J&J; Baby Powder for 36 years and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013.

1045,JNJ,Fitch Affirms Johnson & Johnson's IDR at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ)  Issuer Default Rating at 'AAA'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of  Fitch's rating actions follow at the end of this press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating action follows JNJ's announcement that it will acquire Actelion Ltd.  (Actelion) for $30 billion cash. Actelion will spin off its Research and  Development (R&D;) business as a separate publicly-traded (Switzerland) company  immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition. JNJ will receive 16% of  the R&D; NewCo shares, with the option to acquire an additional 16% through a  convertible note. The transaction allows JNJ to deploy OUS cash in a  tax-efficient manner. Actelion generated roughly $1.8 billion in revenues during  the first nine months of 2016. Fitch views the transaction as strategically  sound, as JNJ will gain a number of approved and in-development therapies. The acquisition gives JNJ five currently-marketed therapies (Opsumit, Tracleer,  Uptravi, Veletri and Ventavis) for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and  two currently-marketed specialty products, Valchlor gel (cutaneous T-cell  lymphoma) and Zavesca (Gaucher disease in the U.S./Nieman-Pick disease in  Europe). JNJ also receives three pipeline products: ponesimod (in phase 3  development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis), cadazolid (in phase 3  development for the treatment Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea) and  ACT-132577 (in phase 2 development for the treatment resistant hypertension).  The 16% stake in the R&D; NewCo also provides for potential longer-term financial  benefits through passive stock price appreciation and/or future R&D;  collaborations.     Innovation-Driven Growth Despite Headwinds: Fitch expects that JNJ will continue  to generate moderate intermediate-term top-line organic growth, despite facing a  number of challenges during 2017 and beyond. The company continues to bring  innovative new products to market and expand the utilization of established  products and franchises. Nevertheless, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and  competition in select franchises dampened reported sales growth during 2016.  Remicade faced biosimilar competition in Europe during 2015 and in the U.S. in  late-2016. The negative effect on sales has been moderate so far. JNJ pursues innovation across all three of its business segments, which provides  it with favorable long-term growth prospects, as well as opportunities to  support margins. R&D; intensity is greatest in its biopharmaceutical business,  followed by the medical device segment. The company also pursues collaborations  and outright acquisitions to supplement its internal new product development  efforts. This strategy has produced a significant number of innovative,  value-added medical therapies and products. While the consumer business is not  as R&D; intensive, innovation is still a key component in defending and advancing  JNJ's franchises in this segment. Broad Portfolio Mitigates Risk: JNJ operates with three business segments and a  large diversified product portfolio, reducing its operational and financial  reliance on any individual product. It employs a decentralized business model  with its various franchises to promote receptivity to their respective markets,  while maintaining a strong cultural-centric philosophy driven by its  longstanding credo. The company develops and manufactures consumer  healthcare-related products, medical devices and pharmaceutical/biologic  therapies. Its diverse business model also enables JNJ to pursue a broad array  of treatment advancements that offer growth opportunities. JNJ's largest selling product, Remicade, accounts for roughly 9.7% of sales. It  is also a biologic, which typically faces patent slopes as opposed to patent  cliffs like traditional, small-molecule drugs. This dynamic mitigates the risk  of generic/biosimilar competition. The next three largest products, in total,  account for less than 10% of company sales, so Fitch views the company's patent  expiration risk as manageable. Free Cash Flow (FCF) for Growth and Shareholder Returns: Fitch looks for JNJ to  produce strong annual FCF (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) during 2016-2017 of $7 billion-$8.5 billion. Moderate organic sales  growth and incrementally improving margins, aided by an improving sales mix and  a continued focus on costs, should support solid cash flow from operations,  offset by manageable capital expenditures and dividends. Fitch expects JNJ will  prioritize cash deployment for dividends, internal/external growth opportunities  and then for share repurchases. JNJ will likely remain acquisitive, focusing on targets or products that offer  innovation and growth in the health care sector. Fitch expects the company to  finance its transactions within the context of its 'AAA' credit profile.  Shareholder-focused activities, such as dividend increases and share repurchases  will presumably continue, and Fitch believes the company will finance these  primarily with FCF.  Current Leverage/Limited Flexibility: Fitch believes JNJ will operate with  leverage consistent with its 'AAA' rating and with solid liquidity supported by  significant cash balances and ample access to credit markets. However, current  leverage of 1.0x leaves the company little flexibility to take on additional  debt. JNJ holds the vast majority of cash outside of the U.S. However, the  company periodically uses some of its OUS cash and short-term investments to  fund targeted and larger acquisitions, as evidenced by the announced acquisition  of Actelion.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for JNJ's 'AAA' rating include  the following: --Low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016 and 2017. --Margin improvement driven by favorable product mix and an ongoing focus on  cost control during the near term. --Annual FCF of $7 billion-$8.5 billion during 2016-2017.  --Leverage to range between 0.8x and 1.0x with moderately increasing levels of  debt.  --Capital deployment priorities focused on dividend and then balanced between  acquisitions and share repurchases, with the mix depending on the availability  and valuation of strategically appropriate targets. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not anticipate a downgrade during its rating horizon, a  negative rating action could occur if some combination of deteriorating  operational performance and leveraging transactions stress the company's credit  profile. Fitch believes the company's broadly diversified health care related  franchises make it more likely that a negative rating action would be prompted  by a leveraging transaction, as opposed to operational stress. Three of the key rating metrics for JNJ's 'AAA' rating that Fitch believes  investors should consider are the following:  --Total debt/FCF of 3.0x (reported Oct. 2, 2016 at 5.2x); --Total debt/EBITDA of 1.0x (reported Oct. 2, 2016 at 1.1x); --Net debt of $4 billion-$5 billion (reported Oct. 2, 2016 at a net cash  position of $13.3 billion). LIQUIDITY Solid Liquidity: JNJ has significant liquidity and access to the credit markets.  Moderate growth and relatively stable margins enabled the company to generate  $5.1 billion of FCF during the latest 12 month (LTM) period ended Oct. 2, 2016.  JNJ had approximately $40.4 billion in cash plus short-term marketable  securities (STMS) and access to $10 billion in short-term borrowings on Oct. 2,  2016.  FULL LIST OF RATINGS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Johnson & Johnson --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AAA'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'AAA';  --Subordinated debt at 'AAA'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1+'; --Commercial paper at 'F1+'.

In September, a state court judge in New Jersey, where J&J; is based, dismissed two talc lawsuits against the company. J&J; spokeswoman Carol Goodrich declined to comment on the Missouri Supreme Court’s decision. The company had argued in court filings that plaintiffs’ attorneys tainted the St. Louis jury pool by spending nearly $10 million on television commercials in the last year, with a disproportionate amount running in St. Louis. Plaintiffs’ lawyers have denied the allegation. Ted Meadows, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, said in a statement on Wednesday that the Missouri Supreme Court affirmed plaintiffs’ right to file their claims in a single location. The next trial is slated to start on Feb. 6 in St. Louis. In that case, Nora Daniels of Columbia, Tennessee, alleges she used J&J; Baby Powder for 36 years and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013.

The dollar has climbed for two days, pulling it back from 7-week lows and leaving it flat on the week, as markets refocused on Trump’s pro-business policies and expectations the currency  would gain from a rise in border tariffs, tax reform and future spending. The 4 percent fall in the dollar in the three weeks from Jan. 3 was a reflection of doubts about how the new president’s policy mix will play out for the currency, particularly after both Trump and Treasury Secretary nominee Steven Mnuchin hinted at concerns over its strength. But many analysts cast it simply as a necessary adjustment to market positioning before the dollar can deliver on what were widespread expectations of a strong rally in 2017. “The market is back on this positive story about Trump’s tax and spending policies. It is gaining on a broad basis,” said Antje Praefke, a strategist with Commerzbank in Frankfurt. “Whether these policies are positive for the dollar in the long-term may be a different story. You need more information about what he will actually do and how that will play out and impact the dollar. But for now the market buys the growth story.” The dollar index, which measures its strength against six major peers, gained 0.2 percent to 100.57 in morning trade in Europe, up from a seven-week low of 99.793 hit on Thursday. It was marginally lower on the day at $1.0694 per euro  and half a percent higher at 115.14 yen. A number of banks, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch and France’s Societe Generale, predicted a revival of the dollar rally in weekly notes on Friday. “There’s a sense of expectations ahead of U.S. GDP later today but also a sense of recoupling with the moves that we’ve seen on yields and stocks,” said Viraj Patel, a strategist with Dutch bank ING in London. “It’s just a market realisation that no matter what officials say (about the dollar’s strength) there is enough there to be bullish. You cannot deny the impact of the moves they are going to make to reflate the economy.” The Swiss franc, held down by intervention by the Swiss National Bank in the past year, hit a seven-month high on Thursday on news of Johnson & Johnson’s $30 billion takeover of Actelion. It was steady at 1.0683 per euro on Friday. “There was a lot of chatter about this deal yesterday,” said a dealer with one bank in London. “Whether they are actively doing it at the moment we can’t say but the franc has certainly proved far stronger than other currencies against the dollar as well.” For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets see reuters://realtime/verb=Open/url=http://emea1.apps.cp.extranet.thomsonreuters.biz/cms/?pageId=livemarkets   (Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)",1272017,http://www.reuters.com/article/global-forex/forex-dollar-heads-for-flat-week-as-inflation-trade-revives-idUSL5N1FH34W

The dollar has climbed for two days as markets refocused on Trump’s pro-business policies and expectations the greenback would gain from a rise in border tariffs, lifting the currency off seven-week lows hit on Wednesday and leaving it flat for the week. Some academic studies have suggested that a 20 percent border tariff on imports would be likely to provoke up to the same amount of strengthening on the dollar side as the economy adjusted and more capital was forced back to the United States. On the other hand, there are concerns that a trade war with major trading partners might have other effects that unnerve markets and prompt investors to head for safe-haven currencies like the yen or the Swiss franc. The 4 percent fall in the dollar in the three weeks from Jan. 3 reflects more doubts about how the new president’s policy mix will play out for the currency, particularly after both Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin hinted at concerns over its strength.

1058,JNJ,GlaxoSmithKline and Gilead to face off at HIV meeting next week,"LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline and Gilead Sciences will vie for business in treating HIV patients next week when both companies unveil clinical trial results at a medical meeting in Seattle. Most attention is focused on Gilead’s next-generation drug bictegravir, a so-called integrase inhibitor similar to GSK’s successful dolutegravir that may offer advantages in terms of greater potency and reduced side effects. GSK plans to defend its patch by highlighting the potential of a new two-drug treatment regimen for controlling the virus behind AIDS, a development that marks a departure from conventional triple drug cocktails. As dolutegravir has been the mainstay of GSK’s HIV business in recent years, investors are nervous about the threat posed by Gilead’s competitor, even though next week’s bictegravir data is only from mid-stage Phase II testing. The drug is also in final stage Phase III testing. GSK Chief Executive Andrew Witty said dolutegravir’s key attribute was its proven track record in avoiding the HIV virus’s potential to develop drug resistance. He described other issues as “peripheral”. “It has an extremely impressive resistance profile,” Witty told analysts after reporting fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.  “It is not easy to beat ... in terms of the thing that really matters, I think that dolutegravir remains an extremely impressive molecule.” Results of Gilead’s Phase II trial comparing bictegravir with dolutegravir when both drugs are used as part of a drug-drug combination will be presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Seattle on Feb. 13. Detailed findings from two Phase III trials testing GSK’s new two-drug combination of dolutegravir and Johnson & Johnson’s rilpivirine will also be presented the same day. GSK already said in December that the studies were successful. GSK sells its HIV drugs through its majority-owned ViiV Healthcare unit, in which Pfizer and Japan’s Shionogi hold minority stakes. GSK said Shionogi had made clear it intended to retain its stake in ViiV and its put options had now been removed.

1059,JNJ,Exclusive: Cancer drugmaker Tesaro attracts takeover interest - sources,"(Reuters) - U.S. biopharmaceutical company Tesaro Inc (TSRO.O) is discussing its options with investment banks after receiving acquisition interest from several drugmakers, according to people familiar with the matter. The takeover interest in Tesaro underscores the pharmaceutical industry’s strong appetite for the acquisition of biotechnology companies with promising medicines under development in lucrative sectors such as cancer treatment. Tesaro is not actively exploring a sale, the people said this week, noting that there is a significant gap over the company’s valuation between Tesaro and potential acquirers.  However, the Waltham, Massachussets-based company is speaking to investment banks, including Citigroup Inc (C.N), about its strategy and how to best respond to such overtures, the people added. Additional clinical trial data later this year on Tesaro’s key drug, Niraparib, which targets advanced solid tumors in ovarian and breast cancers, could help narrow the valuation gap, the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.  Tesaro and Citigroup declined to comment. Tesaro shares rose as much as 17 percent on the news and were up 11 percent at $180.50 in late morning trading in New York on Wednesday, giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion. Tesaro went public in 2012 at $13.50 per share.   Tesaro has been touted for months by analysts and investors as a likely acquisition target, in light of big deals in the biotechnology sector, such as Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) $14 billion acquisition of cancer drugmaker Medivation Inc last September, and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) $30 billion announced acquisition last month of rare disease drugmaker Actelion Ltd ATLN.S. Tesaro has a coveted position as a leader in the so-called immuno-oncology sector, which harnesses the body’s own immune system to combat cancer cells.  Its drug Niraparib kills cancer cells by inhibiting the production of proteins called PARPs, which help repair damaged DNA strands, thereby hastening the death of some types of cancer cells.  Effective PARP inhibitors are particularly sought after by drugmakers because of their potential to be used in combination with other types of cancer treatments to create new breakthroughs in treatments.   Niraparib is closer than any other PARP inhibitor to receiving regulatory approval for ovarian cancer maintenance therapy. Analysts say its peak sales could exceed $3 billion.  Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration agreed to “fast-track” its Niraparib review process, raising the likelihood it could hit the market by 2018.  That would give it a significant head start over its main rival, Clovis Oncology Inc (CLVS.O), whose similar treatment is in late-stage trials. Last year, Tesaro entered into a partnership with pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) to study the effects of using Niraparib in combination with Keytruda, Merck’s immuno-oncology treatment.

Integra, which makes products used in neurosurgery, reconstruction, wound and dental care, made a “binding offer” for the Codman business, which will bolster its pipeline of offerings for tissue ablation, spinal cord repair and cranial stabilization. The companies will finalize the deal after receiving the green light from various works councils and regulators, a J&J; spokeswoman told Reuters, adding that the deal would close in the fourth quarter, if approved. Integra said its adjusted earnings per share would increase by at least 22 cents in the first full year after closing and rise thereafter. The deal would enable the company to generate 30 percent or more of sales from international markets, Integra executives said on a conference call. However, Integra expects some disruption in the Codman business in the first year following the purchase, but forecast the business would grow 3-6 percent in the longer term. The Codman neurosurgery business, which is part of J&J;’s DePuy Synthes unit and markets devices for use in neuro-critical care and electrosurgery, generated sales of about $370 million in 2016. The deal excludes Codman’s neurovascular and drug delivery businesses, J&J; said. The U.S. healthcare giant, which is buying Swiss biotech company Actelion Ltd in a $30 billion deal, said last month it was reviewing strategic options for some of its diabetes care businesses. Integra’s shares rose as much as 6 percent to $45.87 in morning trade, while J&J;’s stock was marginally up.

1067,JNJ,How Sanofi lost out to J&J; in $30 billion battle for Actelion,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss biotech company Actelion ATLN.S, days before agreeing to a $30 billion bid by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), found a rival offer to be as attractive but went with J&J; because its offer provided more certainty, a filing showed on Thursday. Relations had already soured with the rival bidder, identified previously by sources familiar with the situation as French drugmaker Sanofi (SASY.PA), after it went back on an initially higher bid, according to the J&J; filing formally setting out details of the offer.  J&J;’s agreement on Jan. 26 to buy Actelion in an all-cash deal marked the biggest European drugs takeover in 13 years. Although people close to the talks had told Reuters that Sanofi had gained a seat at the negotiating table, the French group has consistently declined to comment. Some investors have expressed frustration at Sanofi’s failure to land a big deal. J&J;’s prospectus for its tender offer revealed the rival bidder, identified only as “Company A”, had made a written proposal on Dec. 12 for a takeover price in cash that outbid J&J;’s and which resulted in the U.S. healthcare group quitting talks.  But just a week later, the rival bidder became unwilling to proceed with talks unless Actelion considered a lower price. “Company A indicated that it would only be willing to proceed with a transaction on the basis of a price lower than its previously communicated offer price and on different terms,” the prospectus said. On Jan. 23, Actelion’s board discussed the merits of the competing offers and decided the financial terms of the two proposals would deliver approximately equivalent value to shareholders. However, the filing said the board concluded: “J&J;’s proposal offered significantly greater transaction certainty because the transaction documentation was nearly final and because J&J; had already completed the required due diligence”. The filing said the tender offer for the Swiss biotech company’s shares would run from March 3 to March 30.  Shares of the new research and development company being spun out of Actelion for a Swiss listing will be distributed to Actelion shareholders as a stock dividend prior to settlement of the tender offer, it said. The prospectus also set out these details on the deal: Actelion will pay the bidder a $500 million break fee if the offer is not successful or does not become unconditional in certain circumstances The minimum acceptance rate is 67 percent. J&J; has agreed to make a 10-year convertible loan worth  580 million Swiss francs to the R&D; pipeline company being spun off; the loan will be convertible, in two tranches, into up to 32 percent of the shares of R&D; NewCo. R&D; NewCo will be financed by the convertible loan, cash on hand of 420 million Swiss francs provided by Actelion, and a credit facility of the franc equivalent of $250 million to be provided by the bidder. Shares of R&D; NewCo are expected to be admitted to listing on the SIX Swiss Exchange on the same day as the Actelion deal settlement.

1073,JNJ,Genmab and J&J;'s cancer drug set for blockbuster sales this year,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish biotech drugmaker Genmab (GEN.CO) expects sales of Darzalex, used to fight cancer in bone marrow, to surpass $1 billion this year to become a blockbuster drug, the company said on Wednesday. The strong performance of Darzalex, which is currently approved to treat multiple myeloma, prompted six upward revisions to the company’s revenue and operating profit guidance for its 2016 financial year. The $1 billion a year required to achieve blockbuster is now in sight, with net sales of Darzalex — approved in November 2015 and is marketed by Johnson & Johnson (J&J;)(JNJ.N) — expected to reach between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion this year, up from $572 million in 2016, Genmab said. Analyst expectations, on average, are for Darzalex to generate as much as $1.18 billion in revenue this year and $2.53 billion by 2020, according to data from Thomson Reuters Cortellis.        Shares in the Danish company have surged by more than 3,200 percent in the past five years as it has morphed from a cash-burning operation into a profitable business with actual drugs on the market. Genmab receives tiered royalties from J&J; on its sales and expects to receive Darzalex royalties of between 930 million Danish crowns and 1,100 million crowns ($132 million-$156 million) and 800 million crowns in milestone payments this year.     Operating income for 2016 came in at 1.1 billion crowns and is expected in the range of 900-1,100 million crowns in 2017.    With a market capitalization of $12 billion, Genmab is Europe’s second-biggest biotech company behind Actelion ATLN.S, although both still lag well behind the likes of U.S. groups Gilead (GILD.O), Amgen (AMGN.O) and Celgene.   However, Genmab’s chief executive Jan van de Winkel believes that Darzalex has the potential to achieve peak annual sales as high as $13 billion if the drug is approved for a wider range of cancers.  “It could work in other blood cancers as well as in solid tumors. So that means $13 billion potential if it would work in all the indications,” van de Winkel told Reuters. He acknowledged that $13 billion would be the most rosy scenario but said that Darzalex could “definitely” achieve more than $9 billion.

1078,JNJ,J&J; says kept drug price increases below 10 pct since 2012,"NEW YORK, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Monday said the average list price of its drugs rose less than 10 percent each year since 2012, noting that the net price paid for the drugs, which includes discounts and rebates, was significantly lower. The company released a report with its price increase history in response to widespread outcry over high U.S. prices for prescription drugs. U.S. President Donald Trump has said drug companies are “getting away with murder” in what they charge the government for medicines. Johnson & Johnson, which makes Remicade for rheumatoid arthritis and the blood thinner Xarelto, said in 2016 the average increase in list price for its drugs was 8.5 percent, while the net price change was 3.5 percent. The highest average price increases at the company over the five-year period were in 2015, when the average list price rose 9.7 percent from the previous year and the average net price increase was 5.2 percent. The company said it generally limits its annual aggregate list price increase to single digit percentages. Merck released a report on its own pricing history last month, revealing slightly larger average increases over the five year period than Johnson & Johnson. In response to the criticism of high drug prices, AbbVie Inc , Allergan and Danish diabetes company Novo Nordisk have pledged to keep all drug price increases in 2017 under 10 percent.

1079,JNJ,Fitch Rates Johnson & Johnson's Notes Offering 'AAA'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'AAA' rating to  Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) senior unsecured notes offering. The proceeds will be  used for general corporate purposes. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Actelion Acquisition: JNJ will acquire Actelion Ltd. (Actelion) for $30 billion  cash. The transaction will be funded using off shore cash. Actelion will spin  off its Research and Development (R&D;) business as a separate publicly-traded  (Switzerland) company immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition.  JNJ will receive 16% of the R&D; NewCo shares, with the option to acquire an  additional 16% through a convertible note. Actelion generated roughly $1.8  billion in revenues during the first nine months of 2016. Fitch views the  transaction as strategically sound, as JNJ will gain a number of approved and  in-development therapies. The acquisition gives JNJ five currently-marketed therapies (Opsumit, Tracleer,  Uptravi, Veletri and Ventavis) for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and  two currently-marketed specialty products, Valchlor gel (cutaneous T-cell  lymphoma) and Zavesca (Gaucher disease in the U.S./Nieman-Pick disease in  Europe). JNJ also receives three pipeline products: ponesimod (in phase 3  development for the treatment of multiple sclerosis), cadazolid (in phase 3  development for the treatment Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea) and an  option on ACT-132577 (in phase 2 development for the treatment resistant  hypertension). The 16% stake in the R&D; NewCo also provides for potential  longer-term financial benefits through passive stock price appreciation and/or  future R&D; collaborations.  Innovation-Driven Growth Despite Headwinds: Fitch expects that JNJ will continue  to generate moderate intermediate-term top-line organic growth, despite facing a  number of challenges during 2017 and beyond. The company continues to bring  innovative new products to market and expand the utilization of established  products and franchises. Nevertheless, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and  competition in select franchises dampened reported sales growth during 2016.  Remicade faced biosimilar competition in Europe during 2015 and in the U.S. in  late-2016. The negative effect on sales has been moderate so far. JNJ pursues innovation across all three of its business segments, which provides  it with favorable long-term growth prospects, as well as opportunities to  support margins. R&D; intensity is greatest in its biopharmaceutical business,  followed by the medical device segment. The company also pursues collaborations  and outright acquisitions to supplement its internal new product development  efforts. This strategy has produced a significant number of innovative,  value-added medical therapies and products. While the consumer business is not  as R&D; intensive, innovation is still a key component in defending and advancing  JNJ's franchises in this segment. Broad Portfolio Mitigates Risk: JNJ operates with three business segments and a  large diversified product portfolio, reducing its operational and financial  reliance on any individual product. It employs a decentralized business model  with its various franchises to promote receptivity to their respective markets,  while maintaining a strong cultural-centric philosophy driven by its  longstanding credo. The company develops and manufactures consumer  healthcare-related products, medical devices and pharmaceutical/biologic  therapies. Its diverse business model also enables JNJ to pursue a broad array  of treatment advancements that offer growth opportunities. JNJ's largest selling product, Remicade, accounts for roughly 9.7% of sales. It  is also a biologic, which typically faces patent slopes as opposed to patent  cliffs like traditional, small-molecule drugs. This dynamic mitigates the risk  of generic/biosimilar competition. The next three largest products, in total,  account for less than 10% of company sales, so Fitch views the company's patent  expiration risk as manageable. Free Cash Flow (FCF) for Growth and Shareholder Returns: Fitch looks for JNJ to  produce strong annual FCF (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures minus  dividends) 2017 of $7 billion-$8.5 billion. Moderate organic sales growth and  incrementally improving margins, aided by an improving sales mix and a continued  focus on costs, should support solid cash flow from operations, offset by  manageable capital expenditures and dividends. Fitch expects JNJ will prioritize  cash deployment for dividends, internal/external growth opportunities and then  for share repurchases. JNJ will likely remain acquisitive, focusing on targets or products that offer  innovation and growth in the health care sector. Fitch expects the company to  finance its transactions within the context of its 'AAA' credit profile.  Shareholder-focused activities, such as dividend increases and share repurchases  will presumably continue, and Fitch believes the company will finance these  primarily with FCF.  Current Leverage/Limited Flexibility: Fitch believes JNJ will operate with  leverage consistent with its 'AAA' rating and with solid liquidity supported by  significant cash balances and ample access to credit markets. However, current  leverage of 1.0x leaves the company little flexibility to take on additional  debt. JNJ holds the vast majority of cash outside of the U.S. However, the  company periodically uses some of its OUS cash and short-term investments to  fund targeted and larger acquisitions, as evidenced by the announced acquisition  of Actelion.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for JNJ's 'AAA' rating include  the following: --Low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2017; --Incremental margin improvement driven by favorable product mix and an ongoing  focus on cost control during the near term; --Annual FCF of $7 billion to $8.5 billion during 2017;  --Leverage to range between 0.8x and 1.0x with moderately increasing levels of  debt;  --Capital deployment priorities focused on dividend and then balanced between  acquisitions and share repurchases, with the mix depending on the availability  and valuation of strategically appropriate targets. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch does not anticipate a downgrade during its rating horizon, a  negative rating action could occur if some combination of deteriorating  operational performance and leveraging transactions stress the company's credit  profile. Fitch believes the company's broadly diversified health care related  franchises make it more likely that a negative rating action would be prompted  by a leveraging transaction, as opposed to operational stress. Three of the key rating metrics for JNJ's 'AAA' rating that Fitch believes  investors should consider are the following:  --Total debt/FCF of 3.0x (reported Oct. 2, 2016 at 5.2x); --Total debt/EBITDA of 1.0x (reported Oct. 2, 2016 at 1.1x); --Net debt of $4 billion-$5 billion (reported Oct. 2, 2016 at a net cash  position of $13.3 billion). LIQUIDITY Solid Liquidity: JNJ has significant liquidity and access to the credit markets.  Moderate growth and relatively stable margins enabled the company to generate  roughly $5.1 billion of FCF during the latest 12 month (LTM) period ended Oct.  2, 2016. JNJ had approximately $40.4 billion in cash plus short-term marketable  securities (STMS) and access to $10 billion in short-term borrowings on Oct. 2,  2016.  FULL LIST OF RATINGS Fitch currently rates Johnson & Johnson as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'AAA'; --Senior unsecured debt 'AAA';  --Subordinated debt 'AAA'; --Short-Term IDR 'F1+'; --Commercial paper 'F1+'.

1080,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson wins trial in talc product liability lawsuits,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said on Friday that a state court jury in Missouri had returned a verdict in its favor in the latest trial to arise out of thousands of lawsuits alleging the company’s talc-based products can increase the risk of ovarian cancer. The jury sided with Johnson & Johnson and talc supplier Imerys Talc in a lawsuit by Tennessee resident Nora Daniels, who alleged that she used J&J; Baby Powder for 36 years and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2013. The verdict came after three straight prior jury verdicts in St. Louis against J&J; awarding plaintiffs a combined $195 million. More than 2,500 lawsuits are pending in state court in St. Louis. “The jury’s decision is consistent with the science, research, clinical evidence and decades of studies by medical experts around the world that continue to support the safety of cosmetic talc,” Johnson & Johnson said in a statement. Imerys in a statement thanked the jury “for following the science that establishes the safety of talc.” Ted Meadows, a lawyer for Daniels, in a statement said he was disappointed by the verdict. “We continue to maintain that the association between genital talc usage and ovarian cancer remains an issue of public health and demands that consumers be warned of the specific risks,” he said in a statement.     Plaintiffs have accused J&J; of failing for years to warn that talc was linked to an increased risk for ovarian cancer. J&J; has said it acted properly in developing and marketing the products. In February 2016, a Missouri state jury ordered J&J; to pay $72 million to the family of a woman who died from ovarian cancer after years of using talc powder for feminine hygiene. In May, another jury in Missouri returned $55 million to a woman who said the company’s talc-powder products caused her to develop ovarian cancer.

1091,JNJ,DEALS-Trump helps make cross-border M&A; great again,"(Reuters) - Cross-border M&A; had its strongest start since 2007, driving first-quarter global volumes up 7 percent, as optimism over U.S. President Donald Trump’s economic agenda buoyed the stock market and the dollar, making foreign acquisitions cheaper than some U.S. targets.  Many U.S. CEOs are feeling richer and more confident thanks to a rally in their companies’ stock. Yet potential U.S. acquisition targets often feel they are worth a lot too, while uncertainty over Trump’s tax policies makes planning a merger more difficult for the companies involved. To be sure, U.S. M&A; was still up 3 percent in the first quarter. Some acquirers brushed off the political uncertainty, and often got around disagreements over the cash value of a company by using their stock as currency to pay for deals. Nonetheless, a few acquirers chose to cast their net overseas. The biggest deal since the start of the year was U.S. healthcare and consumer conglomerate Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) $30 billion agreement in January to acquire Swiss biotechnology firm Actelion Ltd ATLN.S. Other major cross-border deals were attempted unsuccessfully. Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) snubbed a $143 billion acquisition offer from U.S. food conglomerate Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), while Dutch paint maker Akzo Nobel NV (AKZO.AS) rejected a sweetened $24 billion bid from U.S. coatings manufacturer PPG Industries Inc (PPG.N). Some cross-border M&A; even headed in the other direction. British consumer products company Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB.L), for example, agreed in February to acquire baby milk manufacture Mead Johnson Nutrition Company MJN.N for $17.9 billion. “We saw an increase in outbound deals from the United States into Europe, as the outlook on the European economy has improved. Transactions for European targets are also less impacted by uncertainty around potential U.S. tax reform,” said Gary Posternack, global head of mergers & acquisitions at Barclays Plc (BARC.L). Preliminary Thomson Reuters data show that global M&A; totaled $726.5 million in the first quarter, up 7 percent year-on-year. Cross-border M&A; totaled $323.1 billion year-to-date, the highest level since 2007, accounting for 45 percent of total M&A; activity so far this year. Acquisitions by U.S. companies abroad reached $114.1 billion so far in 2017, a triple-digit percentage increase compared with a year ago, surpassing the year-to-date record set in 2007 of $97.1 billion. Europe inbound cross-border M&A; reached $127.1 billion, topping the year-to-date record of $104.5 billion set last year. In the United States, the biggest questions CEOs faced when considering M&A; were around mulled policy reforms that would affect deductibility of interest expense, corporate tax rates, overseas cash repatriation, and the potential cross-border adjustment tax.  “There are a number of people who are saying I want to wait until this fleshes out a bit, until questions around tax or certain healthcare policies get reformed over time, it’s harder to do a deal,” said Robin Rankin, co-head of global M&A; at Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S). Nevertheless, most M&A; advisers appear optimistic. About 44 percent of dealmakers expected M&A; to increase in 2017, an uptick from just 13 percent a year ago, according to a survey published this week by financial communications firm Brunswick Group. After two years of particularly robust M&A; activity - 2016 and 2015 saw the biggest and third biggest M&A; volumes on record, respectively - and historically high corporate valuations, the main impediment to deals is price concerns, dealmakers said.  With his ruling Republican party divided along ideological fault lines, it was also not clear what impact Trump’s failed bid to reform the U.S. healthcare system earlier this month would have on his ability to implement tax proposals. “While the strategic dialogue is as good as it has been in quite some time, many assets are richly valued and uncertainty still exists around tax reform and the regulatory environment,” said Jack MacDonald, co-head of Global M&A; at Bank of America Corp (BAC.N). Recovering oil prices boosted energy M&A;, which reached 118.4 billion so far in 2017, up 41 percent year-on-year.  Credit markets remained wide open, favoring not just big corporate deals but also leveraged buyouts. Global private equity-backed M&A; activity totaled $57.5 billion, the strongest year-to-date period for such deals since 2014, and a 38 percent increase from a year ago.

Goldman Sachs lost 4.7 percent to $215.59, after hitting its lowest intraday level since Nov. 29. The bank posted earnings that missed expectations as trading revenue dropped. Goldman shares suffered their biggest daily percentage drop since June 24, a day after Britain voted to leave the European Union. Johnson & Johnson slumped 3.1 percent for its worst day in 14 months after quarterly revenue fell short of analysts’ expectations. “The Goldman numbers today were disappointing to the market, in what hasn’t been a bad group of numbers for most of the banks,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. “There was some optimism for greater top-line growth and we have seen in the early numbers that have come out that companies have certainly learned how to cost cut and manage the bottom line but they really are having trouble growing the top line.” Healthcare, down 1 percent, and financials, off 0.8 percent, were the two worst-performing of the 11 major S&P; sectors. Cardinal Health, down 11.5 percent, also weighed on healthcare after a disappointing profit forecast overshadowed a deal to buy medical supplies businesses from Medtronic for $6.1 billion. Although Bank of America reported a better-than-expected profit, its shares reversed course to close slightly lower, falling in line with the broader market. A rough start to the earnings season could add to investor concerns about market valuations after a strong post-election rally largely based on expectations of pro-growth policies from President Donald Trump’s administration drove major indexes to record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 113.64 points, or 0.55 percent, to 20,523.28, the S&P; 500 lost 6.83 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,342.18 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.32 points, or 0.12 percent, to 5,849.47. Safe-havens continued to be in favor, with gold and U.S. Treasury prices climbing ahead of crucial presidential elections in France, rising tensions between the United States and North Korea and the calling of early elections in Britain. Despite the high-profile earnings misses, first-quarter results have been promising overall. According to Thomson Reuters data through Tuesday morning, of the 45 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported results, 76 percent have topped expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.27-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 40 new highs and 59 new lows. About 6.07 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.41 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

1109,JNJ,Cardinal Health's dull forecast drags along rivals' shares,"(Reuters) - Cardinal Health Inc said on Tuesday it expected full-year adjusted earnings at the lower end of its forecast, underscoring the U.S. drug distribution industry’s struggles with declining generic drug prices. The company’s shares tumbled 12 percent to $72.13, while rivals McKesson Corp and AmerisourceBergen Corp fell about 5 percent. The forecast overshadowed Cardinal Health’s move to add heft to its growing medical products business through a $6.1 billion deal for Medtronic Plc’s medical supplies units. Cardinal Health, which had forecast adjusted profit in the range of $5.35-$5.50 per share, expects generic price deflation to be in the low-double digits for its year ending June 30. The company had earlier expected a high single digit deflation. “The weaker guidance, which includes the positive accretion from Medtronic’s supply business, is concerning for the distributor sector,” Mizuho Securities USA analyst Ann Hynes said. Speedier approvals of generic drugs by U.S. regulators have ramped up competition, piling pressure on many generic drugmakers. Cardinal Health, which expects preliminary fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings to be flat to down mid-single digits, said increasing competition is contributing to the price deflation. The acquisition of Medtronic’s units will give the drug distributor access to 23 product categories across multiple markets including dental/animal health, wound care and blood collection. The deal also adds 17 manufacturing facilities. “We like the acquisition of Medtronic’s supplies unit, which we believe fits well into Cardinal Health’s strategy in medical, and continues to diversify the business away from pharma distribution,” Cowen & Co analyst Charles Rhyee wrote.    The units generated about $2.4 billion in revenue in the past four quarters, Medtronic said. Medtronic and Cardinal Health had entered into exclusive talks for the business, Reuters reported earlier in the month. However, analysts said investors are likely to focus on the generic price deflation. While the deal looks strategically and financially sensible, it is likely not enough to offset the ongoing generic deflation headwinds, Leerink Partners analyst said.  Cardinal Health plans to issue long-term debt to finance the transaction and has obtained a $4.5 billion unsecured bridge loan. Medtronic’s financial advisers are Piper Jaffray and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, while its legal advisers are Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Baker McKenzie.

The S&P; 500 healthcare sector fell 1.4 percent, dragged down by a 3.4 percent decline in Johnson & Johnson after the company’s quarterly revenue fell short of analysts’ expectations. Goldman Sachs sank 4.6 percent after a rare profit miss due to weak trading revenue. The bank dragged down other financial stocks and shaved 73 points off the Dow. Goldman is set to record its worst day since June 24, a day after Britain voted to leave the European Union. Although Bank of America reported a better-than-expected profit, its shares reversed course to trade slightly lower, falling in line with the broader market. “The news out this morning is earnings-related, but with concerns of the Trump agenda being pushed out a little bit and with the geopolitical tensions, this is not the kind of news you needed and it gives people a reason to not be buyers of the overall market,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. A rough start to the earnings season could add to investor concerns about market valuations, especially after a strong post-election rally drove major indexes to record highs. Markets are also worried about President Donald Trump’s ability to quickly implement pro-growth policies such as tax cuts, in the wake of a failed healthcare reform bill. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned that tax reforms could be delayed following the healthcare bill setback. At 12:28 p.m. ET (1628 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 141.85 points, or 0.69 percent, at 20,495.07, the S&P; 500 was down 11.02 points, or 0.47 percent, at 2,337.99 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 24.07 points, or 0.41 percent, at 5,832.72. Safe-havens continued to be in favor ahead of crucial presidential elections in France, rising tensions between the United States and North Korea and the possibility of snap elections in Britain. Nine of the 11 major S&P; sectors were down. The only ones to gain were consumer staples and utilities, whose slow but steady growth makes them attractive during periods of uncertainty. Netflix, the first of the FANG stocks to report results, was down 2.2 percent at $144.01 after the video streaming services provider reported weaker-than-expected subscriber numbers in the first quarter. One bright spot was UnitedHealth, whose shares rose about 1 percent after the health insurer reported better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its profit and revenue forecasts for the year. The stock provided the biggest boost to the S&P; and the Dow. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,933 to 915. On the Nasdaq, 1,892 issues fell and 820 advanced. The S&P; 500 index showed 16 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 28 highs and 42 lows.

1112,JNJ,J&J; first quarter revenue misses estimates; new forecast includes Actelion,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday reported disappointing pharmaceutical and consumer product sales as revenue missed analyst estimates, sending its shares sharply lower.  However, cost controls and lower taxes helped the healthcare conglomerate beat Wall Street profit forecasts. J&J; shares, part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, fell 3.6 percent to $121.11 in the biggest one-day percentage decline in more than eight years as the company said it expected a slower growth rate for pharmaceuticals this year. Overall sales of $17.77 billion in the quarter fell short of analysts’ average estimate of $18.04 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The company, which is on track to close its $30-billion acquisition of Actelion in the current quarter, issued a new full-year forecast to include Europe’s largest biotech. With Actelion, J&J; expects 2017 sales of $75.4 billion to $76.1 billion and adjusted earnings of $7.00 to $7.15 per share. It forecast Actelion will contribute 35-40 cents to earnings per share in 2018. “The expected benefit from the Actelion acquisition this year came in lower than our estimates,” said Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans. “Additionally, the company’s total growth came in lower than we expected, which is disappointing.” Without Actelion, J&J; maintained its prior forecast for sales of $74.1 billion to $74.8 billion and adjusted earnings of $6.93 to $7.08 per share.    “We remain on track for achieving our full-year guidance,” Chief Financial Officer Dominic Caruso said on a conference call. J&J; is the first major pharmaceutical company to report quarterly results since Republican attempts to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system failed. While forecasts do not include expectations of tax reform, Caruso expressed confidence that Washington will come through with a lower U.S. corporate tax rate at some point. Pharmaceutical sales rose just 0.8 percent to $8.25 billion, constrained by competition and pricing pressure, which hurt the diabetes drug Invokana and Xarelto blood thinner. Newer blood cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica demonstrated very strong growth, while prostate cancer drug Zytiga struggled with U.S. sales off 14.3 percent. Consumer products grew 1 percent to $3.23 billion, held back by a slowdown at retailers, inventory destocking and economic issues in Latin America.

The S&P; 500 healthcare sector sank 1 percent, dragged down by a 3.2 percent drop in Johnson & Johnson after the company’s quarterly revenue missed expectations. The financial sector was pressured by a 3.5 percent decline in Goldman Sachs, whose quarterly profit fell below estimates due to weak trading revenue. Goldman pulled down shares of other major U.S. banks and shaved more than 64 points off the Dow. Although Bank of America reported better-than-expected profit, its shares reversed course to trade slightly lower, falling in line with the broader trend. “The news out this morning is earnings-related, but with concerns of the Trump agenda being pushed out a little bit and with the geopolitical tensions, this is not the kind of news you needed and it gives people a reason to not be buyers of the overall market,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. At 11:06 a.m. ET (1506 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 101.27 points, or 0.49 percent, at 20,535.65, the S&P; 500 was down 6.91 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,342.1 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 16.18 points, or 0.28 percent, at 5,840.61. A rally in U.S. stocks has stalled recently after President Donald Trump’s administration failed to pass a healthcare reform bill through Congress. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned tax reforms could be delayed following setbacks in negotiations with Congress over healthcare. Safe-havens continued to be in favor ahead of crucial presidential elections in France, rising tensions between the United States and North Korea and the possibility of snap elections in Britain. Nine of the 11 major S&P; sectors were down. The only ones to gain were consumer staples and utilities, whose slow but steady growth makes them attractive during periods of uncertainty. Netflix, the first of the FANG stocks to report, was down 1 percent at $145.70 after the video streaming service provider reported weaker-than-expected subscriber numbers in the first quarter, but forecast strong growth in the current quarter. One bright spot was Dow component UnitedHealth whose shares rose 1.3 percent to $169.25 after the health insurer reported better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its profit and revenue forecasts for the year. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,667 to 1,094. On the Nasdaq, 1,774 issues fell and 843 advanced. The S&P; 500 index showed 15 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 26 highs and 33 lows.

The S&P; 500 healthcare sector tumbled 0.83 percent, as Johnson & Johnson fell 2.6 percent after the company reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ expectations. The financial sector was pressured by a 3.5 percent decline in Goldman Sachs, which reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit due to weak trading revenue. Goldman influenced other major U.S. banks, including Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo, which traded lower. Bank of America pared most of its premarket gains and was up 0.5 percent even after reporting a quarterly profit that beat expectations. “The key for the market is still earnings, economic growth etc, and politics is merely a daily side show,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, Illinois. Following a strong post-election rally, especially in the banking sector, investors are now looking at quarterly earnings to help justify lofty valuations in the market. At 9:41 a.m. ET (1341 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 66.05 points, or 0.32 percent, at 20,570.87, the S&P; 500 was down 4.4 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,344.61 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 8.21 points, or 0.14 percent, at 5,848.58. Adding to the downbeat sentiment was a warning from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that U.S. tax reforms could be delayed following setbacks in negotiations with Congress over healthcare. Safe-havens continued to be in favor ahead of crucial presidential elections in France, rising tensions between the United States and North Korea and the possibility of snap elections in Britain.

Friday is the next deadline for Actelion shareholders to take J&J;’s $30 billion, $280 per share offer.

Should that happen, the SIX Swiss Exchange could make an announcement as early as Friday about future steps leading to another company filling Actelion’s place in the SMI. Candidates include drug ingredients maker Lonza (LONN.S), adhesives maker Sika (SIK.S) and asset manager Partners Group (PGHN.S), as well as hearing aid maker Sonova (SOON.S).

1119,JNJ,FDA approves Samsung Bioepis' copy of J&J;'s Remicade: company,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd said on Saturday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its copy of Johnson & Johnson’s rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, the first drug developed by the Samsung Group unit approved in the United States. The drug, called Renflexis, is a biosimilar – a copy of a biotech drug - and the second Remicade copy to be approved in the world’s largest pharmaceutical market. Remicade is J&J;’s biggest selling drug with U.S. sales of about $5 billion a year. Established in 2012 as a relative latecomer to the industry, Samsung Bioepis has found early success by beating rivals to market on biosimilars of some of the world’s top-selling drugs by so far investing $1.3 billion into biosimilar development.  It became the first company to launch a biosimilar version of Amgen’s Enbrel, another rheumatoid arthritis drug, in Europe. It also submitted for approval its copy of Roche’s blockbuster breast cancer drug Herceptin and its copy of AbbVie Inc’s rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, both in Europe. Renflexis will be marketed and distributed in the United States by Merck & Co Inc, Samsung Bioepis said in a statement. It received European approval in May 2016. The FDA approved the drug a little more than a year after  the first Remicade biosimilar copy - Pfizer’s Inflectra, developed by South Korea’s Celltrion – was approved. Inflectra was introduced in the U.S. in late 2016. Remicade accounted for about 9.7 percent of Johnson & Johnson’s total revenues for fiscal 2016, and biosimilar competition is expected to reduce U.S. sales, J&J; said in its annual report.

The owners of investment vehicles Igarapava Participações SA and Maiorem SA de CV, which hold a combined 34 percent of Hypermarcas, hired Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4.SA) and Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S) to advise them on options for their stakes, including a sale, said the people. According to one of the people, who requested anonymity because the matter is private, the purchase of the stakes that Brazilian billionaire João Alves Queiroz Filho and the Mexican family that own Igarapava and Maiorem, respectively, would automatically trigger a buyout of minority shareholders. Shares of Hypermarcas closed 3.8 percent up at 30.35 reais on Monday, on optimism that a deal could boost the company’s $6 billion market value.

1126,JNJ,UPDATE 4-Lazard profit beats estimates as deal-making picks up,"(Reuters) - Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, mainly driven by growth in its financial advisory business as cross-border mergers and acquisitions got off to the strongest start in a decade. Lazard was involved in several big cross-border deals in 2017, including Johnson & Johnson’s $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotechnology company Actelion and Harman’s $8.7 billion buyout by Samsung. Optimism over U.S. President Donald Trump’s economic agenda buoyed the stock market and the dollar, making foreign acquisitions cheaper than some U.S. targets. Cross-border M&As; totaled $323.1 billion as of March end this year, the highest level since 2007, accounting for 45 percent of total M&A; activity, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data. “We’ve increased our market share in M&A; globally, with especially high levels of activity in Europe,” Chief Executive Kenneth Jacobs said on a post-earnings call with analysts.  The first half of 2017 continues to look strong relative to last year, he said. Lazard, often seen as a bellwether for the M&A; advisory industry, said earnings from its financial advisory business surged 26.2 percent to $335.8 million in the first quarter ended March 31. The company’s shares fell 2.9 percent to $43 late Thursday afternoon. Lazard also benefited from a strong performance in its asset management business, which the company has been building up to diversify its revenue stream. Revenue from the asset management business rose 16.2 percent to $278.4 million, accounting for about 40 percent of the total revenue.         Major U.S. banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), also reported a jump in investment banking fees for the most recent quarter. Global investment banking fees reached a 10-year high in the first quarter of 2017 with more than half of the $24 billion in total takings coming from North America, according to Thomson Reuters data. Net income attributable to Lazard rose to $107.6 million, or 81 cents per share, in the quarter, from $66.8 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 83 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 79 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose nearly 25 percent to $637.4 million. ",4272017,http://www.reuters.com/article/lazard-results/update-4-lazard-profit-beats-estimates-as-deal-making-picks-up-idUSL4N1HZ4M9

Analysts had expected a worse result for Xarelto, a key drug for Bayer, after partner Johnson & Johnson, which owns the U.S. rights, reported a near 10 percent drop in sales for the drug hit by discounting. Bayer’s quarterly sales of Xarelto, prescribed to prevent potentially deadly blood clotting, climbed by about 20 percent to 751 million euros ($819 million), Bayer said. “Our key growth products were once again especially successful,” Bayer said in a statement, also citing contraceptive Mirena, eye medicine Eylea and cancer drugs Xofigo and Stivarga. Bayer shares rose 3 percent to an 11-month high, topping the German blue-chip DAX, which was flat. On top of rivalry from competing blood thinners, J&J;’s U.S. sales were dragged down by discounts granted to patients to offset reimbursement gaps in the U.S. government’s Medicare program. J&J; pays up to 30 percent in royalties to Bayer. Xarelto competes mainly with Eliquis from Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb as well as with Pradaxa from Boehringer Ingelheim. “Xarelto was better than many had expected following weak U.S. number from J&J; last week,” Bernstein analysts wrote in a note, reiterating their “outperform” rating on the stock. “Bayer beat expectations for all divisions.” Adjusted group earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 15 percent to 3.9 billion euros ($4.2 billion), topping the 3.6 billion forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. Bayer said it now expected group EBITDA before special items to improve by a “low-teens percentage”, up from a medium single-digit percentage gain seen previously. It pointed to a brighter outlook for its plastics and chemicals subsidiary Covestro, which reported earnings on Tuesday. Bayer also announced that its Chief Financial Officer Johannes Dietsch will leave the company at his own request in May 2018, after helping the German drugs and pesticides maker conclude its planned $66 billion acquisition of U.S. seeds giant Monsanto by the end of this year.

1136,JNJ,J&J; ordered to pay $110 million in U.S. talc-powder trial,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Thursday was ordered by a Missouri jury to pay over $110 million to a Virginia woman who says she developed ovarian cancer after decades of using of its talc-based products for feminine hygiene. The verdict in state court in St. Louis was the largest so far to arise out of about 2,400 lawsuits accusing J&J; of not adequately warning consumers about the cancer risks of talc-based products including its well-known Johnson’s Baby Powder. Many of those lawsuits are pending in St. Louis, where the J&J; has faced four prior trials, three of which resulted in $197 million verdicts against J&J; and a talc supplier. Thursday’s verdict came in a lawsuit against J&J; and talc supplier Imerys Talc by Lois Slemp, a resident of Virginia who is currently undergoing chemotherapy after her ovarian cancer initially diagnosed in 2012 returned and spread to her liver. Slemp claimed she developed cancer after four decades of using talc-containing products produced by J&J;, including J&J;’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder. The jury awarded $5.4 million in compensatory damages and said J&J; was 99 percent at fault while Imerys was just 1 percent. It awarded punitive damages of $105 million against J&J; and $50,000 against Imerys. Reuters watched the verdict through Courtroom View Network, which broadcast it online. “Once again we’ve shown that these companies ignored the scientific evidence and continue to deny their responsibilities to the women of America,” Ted Meadows, a lawyer for Slemp and other plaintiffs, said in a statement. J&J; in a statement said it sympathized with women impacted by ovarian cancer but planned to appeal. “We are preparing for additional trials this year and we continue to defend the safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder,” J&J; said.

That verdict broke a three-trial winning streak by plaintiffs that began with a verdict in February 2016 in which a jury awarded $72 million to the family of a woman who died from ovarian cancer.

1156,JNJ,Janssen files suit in U.S. to block sale of Samsung Bioepis' Remicade copy,"SEOUL (Reuters) - A unit of healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson filed a lawsuit to block a copy of its rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade made by South Korea’s Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd from being sold in the United States. Janssen Biotech Inc, in a suit filed to the U.S. District Court of New Jersey dated Wednesday, seeks a preliminary or permanent injunction to block Samsung Bioepis’ biosimilar of Remicade from sale and argues the South Korean firm violated three of its patents. “We have filed a lawsuit against Samsung to investigate whether their biosimilar infliximab infringes on our manufacturing process patents for Remicade,” Janssen told Reuters in a statement on Friday.  Remicade is Johnson & Johnson’s biggest selling drug, with U.S. sales of about $5 billion a year.     “We are confident we do not infringe Janssen’s patents,” Samsung Bioepis told Reuters in a statement, adding it believes Janssen is trying to delay the market entry of its Remicade copy.  “We will take all necessary measures against Janssen’s attempts to violate patient rights and deny patient access to effective, lower cost treatment options.”     Janssen’s lawsuit comes about a month after Samsung, an unlisted subsidiary of contract drug maker Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd, said it got U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to sell its biosimilar of Remicade, which is marketed as Renflexis in the United States. Analysts say biotech makers face increasing competition from firms such as Samsung Bioepis, which make biosimilar copies of Remicade and other drugs and sell them for cheaper.

Separately, Actelion said on Friday it had published the prospectus relating to the listing of shares in Idorsia, the spin-off company which will be led by current Actelion Chief Executive Jean-Paul Clozel. Under the agreement all Actelion shareholders will receive one Idorsia share for each Actelion share held on June 13, 2017 with the new company expected to start trading on the Swiss exchange on June 16. Idorsia will specialize in the discovery and development of small molecules in multiple therapeutic areas including central nervous system disorders, cardiovascular disorders, immunological disorders and orphan diseases, the company said.

The European Commission, which rules on issues of competition for the 28-member bloc, said that both companies were developing treatment for insomnia based on a novel mechanism and there would be insufficient competition in this area if one of the two research programmes were discontinued. Actelion’s insomnia programme was to be transferred to a newly created company called Idorsia, in which Johnson & Johnson would hold a 32 percent stake. The Commission said this holding would allow it to exercise influence on decisions. The Commission said Johnson & Johnson would have to limit its shareholding in Idorsia to below 10 percent - or up to 16 percent provided J&J; was not the largest shareholder - and commit not to nominate a board member. It would also have to grant Minerva Neurosciences, a partner for its own insomnia research programme, new rights over global development and waive its royalty rights on Minerva’s sales in Europe. “In view of the specific features of this case, these commitments addressed the Commission’s competitive concerns concerning treatments in development for insomnia,” the Commission said.

1180,JNJ,"Bayer, J&J; win second U.S. trial over Xarelto bleeding risks","(Reuters) - A federal jury has cleared Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson of liability in the second trial to stem from thousands of lawsuits blaming injuries on the blood thinner Xarelto, the drug companies said on Monday. The verdict by a jury in New Orleans came in a lawsuit by the husband and children of Sharyn Orr, who blamed her 2015 death following a stroke on inadequate information the companies provided her doctor about the drug’s bleeding risks. The case is second in a series of bellwether trials in the federal product liability litigation over Xarelto’s bleeding risks. The companies also won in a previous trial on May 3. The two cases are among an estimated 18,600 lawsuits in federal and state courts related to Xarelto. Bellwethers are supposed to help both sides assess similar claims that the companies downplayed the drug’s bleeding risks. Bayer in a statement said the two verdicts “affirm both the safety and efficacy of Xarelto, and that its FDA-approved label contains accurate, science-based information on the benefits and risks of this life-saving medicine.” J&J;’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc unit in a statement said it will continue to defend against the allegations in the litigation. Andy Birchfield and Brian Barr, co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs, in a statement said they “will continue to press forward with the legal claims of the thousands of innocent victims of this drug.” The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Xarelto in 2011. The drug is prescribed for people with a common heart rhythm disorder known as atrial fibrillation and to treat and reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms. But plaintiffs contend Xarelto was unreasonably dangerous and that J&J; and Bayer, which jointly developed it, failed to warn patients about a serious risk of uncontrollable, irreversible bleeding in emergencies. In the trial over Orr’s death, her husband, Joseph Orr, and her surviving children said she suffered a stroke in late April 2015, a year after her doctor prescribed her Xarelto to treat her atrial fibrillation. The plaintiffs’ lawyers said that based on inadequate information from Bayer and J&J;, a doctor decided to wait 12 hours before operating because he feared the Xarelto she took would cause Orr to bleed out. She died on May 4, 2015, despite the surgery. Bayer and J&J; contended Xarelto’s warnings were adequate and that any purported inadequacy did not cause her death.

1186,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson's flu drug succeeds in mid-stage trial,"(Reuters) - Diversified healthcare company Johnson & Johnson said on Wednesday its experimental flu drug significantly reduced the presence of the virus in patients with a type of influenza in a mid-stage study. With its antiviral drug, pimodivir, J&J; aims to help treat influenza patients who have developed resistance to existing antiviral drugs as well as address the lack of approved medications for people hospitalized with the virus, the company said. More than one billion people suffer from influenza worldwide each year, resulting in about five million cases of severe illness and up to half a million deaths. J&J;’s trial tested pimodivir as a mono-therapy or in combination with a widely used flu drug, oseltamivir, for the treatment of acute uncomplicated seasonal influenza. Influenza viruses can evolve from one flu season to the next, and even change within the course of the same season. As a flu virus replicates, its genetic makeup may change in a way that results in the virus becoming resistant to treatment. There are three antiviral drugs recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention for this season: oseltamivir (which is available as a generic or under the trade name Tamiflu), zanamivir and peramivir. Pimodivir targets another part of the viral replication process when compared to oseltamivir, and if successful, could treat influenza A patients who have developed resistance to existing treatments. J&J; said trial data showed that treatment with pimodivir alone resulted in a statistically significant reduction in viral load in patients over seven days from the start of dosing, when compared with a placebo. Adding pimodivir to oseltamivir also resulted in a significantly lower viral load compared to those who received pimodivir alone, the company added. Pimodivir was granted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s “fast-track” status in March due to its potential to address medication for patients who develop the  influenza A infection and are hospitalized, or are at high risk of related complications. The Band-aid maker bought the worldwide rights to pimodivir from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc in 2014, and its development is being funded in part by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. J&J; said it expects to begin a late-stage trial for the drug in the second half of the year. The company’s shares were up 0.8 percent at $133.06 in early trading on Wednesday.

1196,JNJ,U.S. Supreme Court ruling threatens massive talc litigation against J&J;,"June 21 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson is seizing upon a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from Monday limiting where injury lawsuits can be filed to fight off claims it failed to warn women that talcum powder could cause ovarian cancer. New Jersey-based J&J; has been battling a series of lawsuits over its talc-based products, including Johnson’s Baby Powder, brought by around 5,950 women and their families. The company denies any link between talc and cancer. A fifth of the plaintiffs have cases pending in state court in St. Louis, where juries in four trials have hit J&J; and a talc supplier with $307 million in verdicts. Those four cases and most of the others on the St. Louis docket involve out-of-state plaintiffs suing an out-of-state company. On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in a case involving Bristol-Myers Squibb Co that state courts cannot hear claims against companies that are not based in the state when the alleged injuries did not occur there. The ruling immediately led a St. Louis judge at J&J;’s urging to declare a mistrial in the latest talc case, in which two of the three women at issue were from out of state. It also could imperil prior verdicts and cases that have yet to go to trial. “We believe the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the Bristol-Myers Squibb matter requires reversal of the talc cases that are currently under appeal in St. Louis,” J&J; said in a statement. The question of where such lawsuits can be filed has been the subject of fierce debate. The business community has argued plaintiffs should not be allowed to shop around for the most favorable court to bring lawsuits, while injured parties claim corporations are trying to deny them access to justice. Along with talc cases, large-scale litigation alleging injuries from Bayer AG’s Essure birth control device in Missouri and California and GlaxoSmithKline’s antidepressant Paxil in California and Illinois are examples of other cases where defendants could utilize the Supreme Court decision. Although he declared a mistrial on Monday, St. Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison left the door open for the plaintiffs to argue they still have jurisdiction. Plaintiffs lawyer Ted Meadows said he would argue the St. Louis court still had jurisdiction based on a Missouri-based bottler J&J; used to package its talc products, which he said would create a sufficient connection to the state. “It’s very disappointing to mistry a case because the Supreme Court changed the rules on us,” said Meadows. The lawsuit decided by the high court on Monday involved claims against Bristol-Myers and California-based drug distributor McKesson Corp by 86 California residents and 575 non-Californians over the blood thinner Plavix. Beyond Monday’s mistrial, the Supreme Court’s ruling could bolster a pending appeal by J&J; of a $72 million verdict in favor of the family of Alabama resident Jacqueline Fox, who died in 2015. A Missouri appeals court had said in May it would wait until the Supreme Court issued its decision to decide the appeal. J&J; has won only one of the five trials so far in Missouri. It previously sought to move talc cases out of St. Louis, but the Missouri Supreme Court in January denied its bid. The company has also cast the St. Louis court as overly plaintiff-friendly and has allowed evidence linking talc to cancer that was rejected by a New Jersey state court judge overseeing over 200 talc cases. The plaintiffs are appealing. The talc verdicts against J&J; led the business-friendly American Tort Reform Association last year to declare the St. Louis state court the nation’s top “Judicial Hellhole.” Now J&J; could try to use the Supreme Court ruling to dismiss many of the cases it faces in Missouri, according to legal experts. Corporations facing a large volume of cases in venues chosen by plaintiffs will likely cite the Supreme Court to try to dismiss those claims, said Rusty Perdew, a defense lawyer at the law firm Locke Lord. “You have a bunch of defendants who can go back and say, ‘Judge, you got that wrong and you’re going to have to dismiss claims by all those plaintiffs,’” he said.",6212017,http://www.reuters.com/article/johnsonjohnson-cancer-lawsuit/u-s-supreme-court-ruling-threatens-massive-talc-litigation-against-jj-idUSL1N1JH27C

On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in a case involving Bristol-Myers Squibb Co that state courts cannot hear claims against companies that are not based in the state when the alleged injuries did not occur there. The ruling immediately led a St. Louis judge at J&J;’s urging to declare a mistrial in the latest talc case, in which two of the three women at issue were from out of state. It also could imperil prior verdicts and cases that have yet to go to trial. “We believe the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the Bristol-Myers Squibb matter requires reversal of the talc cases that are currently under appeal in St. Louis,” J&J; said in a statement. The question of where such lawsuits can be filed has been the subject of fierce debate. The business community has argued plaintiffs should not be allowed to shop around for the most favorable court to bring lawsuits, while injured parties claim corporations are trying to deny them access to justice. Along with talc cases, large-scale litigation alleging injuries from Bayer AG’s Essure birth control device in Missouri and California and GlaxoSmithKline’s antidepressant Paxil in California and Illinois are examples of other cases where defendants could utilize the Supreme Court decision. Although he declared a mistrial on Monday, St. Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison left the door open for the plaintiffs to argue they still have jurisdiction. Plaintiffs lawyer Ted Meadows said he would argue the St. Louis court still had jurisdiction based on a Missouri-based bottler J&J; used to package its talc products, which he said would create a sufficient connection to the state. “It’s very disappointing to mistry a case because the Supreme Court changed the rules on us,” said Meadows. The lawsuit decided by the high court on Monday involved claims against Bristol-Myers and California-based drug distributor McKesson Corp by 86 California residents and 575 non-Californians over the blood thinner Plavix. Beyond Monday’s mistrial, the Supreme Court’s ruling could bolster a pending appeal by J&J; of a $72 million verdict in favor of the family of Alabama resident Jacqueline Fox, who died in 2015. A Missouri appeals court had said in May it would wait until the Supreme Court issued its decision to decide the appeal. J&J; has won only one of the five trials so far in Missouri. It previously sought to move talc cases out of St. Louis, but the Missouri Supreme Court in January denied its bid. The company has also cast the St. Louis court as overly plaintiff-friendly and has allowed evidence linking talc to cancer that was rejected by a New Jersey state court judge overseeing over 200 talc cases. The plaintiffs are appealing. The talc verdicts against J&J; led the business-friendly American Tort Reform Association last year to declare the St. Louis state court the nation’s top “Judicial Hellhole.” Now J&J; could try to use the Supreme Court ruling to dismiss many of the cases it faces in Missouri, according to legal experts.

1200,JNJ,Australian class action suit filed against Johnson & Johnson over pelvic mesh,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian women have brought a class-action case against Johnson & Johnson over complications arising from vaginal mesh implants - a lawsuit that follows many others in the United States, Canada and Europe.    The claim, which is being heard in Australia’s Federal Court, said patients had suffered chronic pain, bleeding and severe discomfort during sexual intercourse since having the mesh surgically implanted. The devices are used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Australian action was brought on behalf of more than 700 claimants.   Johnson & Johnson said it was only aware of 200 “product events” after selling more than 100,000 pelvic floor repair products in Australia.  “It is always a concern to us when a patient doesn’t get the outcome they had hoped for, or believes they have experienced an adverse event,” spokeswoman Meshlin Khouri said in a statement. “However it is important to remember that the majority of women who have undergone this surgery have had a positive result, and it has improved their quality of life.” Johnson & Johnson is one of several manufacturers that sold the devices. Those companies are facing tens of thousands of individual lawsuits from plaintiffs who said they were injured by the mesh’s poor design and substandard materials. In May, California accused Johnson & Johnson of failing to warn doctors and patients about the severity and frequency of complications associated with its pelvic mesh devices. An Australian parliamentary committee is also holding an inquiry into the products and is expected to report its findings at the end of November.

1204,JNJ,J&J; sees sales growth in near-term; raises 2017 profit forecast,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) said it expects sales growth to pick up in the second half of the year on strong demand for newer, pricey treatments such as cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica. J&J;, which reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and raised its full-year profit forecast on Tuesday, is banking on newer pharmaceuticals to counter slowing demand for some of its older, best-selling products, including Remicade and diabetes drug Invokana. J&J;’s shares were up 1.9 percent at $134.64 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said that when drugs add months or years to patient lives and make significant differences on health outcomes, as with multiple myeloma treatment Darzalex and leukemia drug Imbruvica, the company has experienced less pricing pressure.  The price tag for the first year of treatment of Darzalex is around $140,000. A year’s supply of Imbruvica capsules costs around $120,000. Pharmaceutical companies have come under pressure to cut prices from insurers and the federal government. J&J; is one of several companies that have said they will keep annual price increases mostly below 10 percent. President Donald Trump has said that he will work to bring down drug prices. J&J; is the first among major pharmaceutical companies to release quarterly results. The report comes a day after a Republican effort to pass healthcare legislation in the Senate collapsed. Gorsky was in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday meeting with U.S. and global leaders to discuss healthcare-related issues.  Excluding special items, J&J;, which also makes medical products and consumer products including Band-Aids, earned $1.83 per share in the second quarter, beating analysts’ estimates by 3 cents.

1208,JNJ,UPDATE 2-China adds blockbuster drugs to insurance list after price cuts,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will add three dozen new drugs to a list of medicines covered by basic insurance schemes after global pharmaceutical firms agreed to slash prices of blockbuster treatments for cancer, diabetes and heart disease. The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security in a statement on Wednesday said it had agreed to add 36 drugs to the National Reimbursable Drugs List (NRDL) in return for an average 44 percent price cut against last year’s retail prices. The government is looking to juggle access to medicines with managing public healthcare spending. High drug costs and lack of access to current treatments is a flashpoint in China, where patients often resort to grey markets for cheaper medicine. The ministry updated the NRDL after an eight year hiatus in February, when it said it was still negotiating around 45 expensive medicines with high clinical value. On Wednesday, it said the agreed price cuts were as much as 70 percent - reflecting drugmakers’ desire to get their products onto state insurance schemes, which helps boost sales volumes. “After the negotiations, the majority of the imported medicines will be cheaper than in surrounding international markets, greatly reducing the financial burden on Chinese patients from healthcare costs,” the ministry said. The additions to the list include a number of major cancer drugs such as Roche Holding AG’s Herceptin, Avastin and MabThera, Celgene Corp’s Revlimid, Johnson & Johnson’s Zytiga and Novartis AG’s Afinitor. Also included are AstraZeneca PLC’s heart treatment Brilinta and Novo Nordisk A/S’ diabetes injection Victoza. The ministry said of the 36 drugs added, 31 were “Western” treatments - including 15 for cancer - and five were traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). Updating the list represents a fillip for pharmaceutical firms in the world’s second-largest drug market, where high costs put many new drugs out of patients’ reach.

1211,JNJ,"UPDATE 1-Merck, Samsung Bioepis launch discounted U.S. Remicade alternative","NEW YORK/SEOUL (Reuters) - Merck & Co and South Korea’s Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd said on Monday they have begun selling a less expensive alternative version of Johnson & Johnson’s rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade in the United States, a move that should accelerate price declines for the big-selling medicine. The U.S. and Korean drugmakers said they would sell their version, to be called Renflexis, at 35 percent discount to the list price of J&J;’s top-selling medicine, or about $735 for a 100 milligram dose.  J&J; shares were down 1.6 percent at $133.16. Renflexis is the second U.S. biosimilar version of Remicade to be sold after Pfizer Inc launched its Inflectra late last year at a 15 percent discount to J&J;’s list price, later dropped to a 19 percent discount. Remicade had U.S. sales of $4.8 billion last year. They fell 8.2 percent for the first half of 2017 to $2.2 billion with the  new competition. As with generic medicines, once multiple biosimilars of a drug become available prices are expected to drop more quickly. Many industry executives and analysts have expressed surprise at how fast prices have fallen in Europe, which led the way with biosimilars. Merck sells the branded version of Remicade outside the United States. In Europe, it is already facing competition from biosimilar Remicade and cheaper versions of other medicines in the class. Many companies are developing a wide range of biosimilar versions of top-selling biologic medicines, including major biotechs like Amgen Inc, which is working on cheaper versions of several of its rivals’ blockbuster drugs.   J&J;, in a statement, said it offers a variety of discounts and rebates off the list price of Remicade, giving it an average sales price of $808.87 per 100mg vial.    J&J;’s Janssen unit sought a preliminary or permanent U.S. injunction to block the Bioepis version, arguing that it infringed three of its patents. A hearing for the lawsuit has yet to be scheduled.  “We are confident we do not infringe on Janssen’s patents,” Samsung Bioepis spokesman Mingi Hyun said. Renflexis, which received U.S. approval in April, is the first medicine available in the United States under a global biosimilars agreement between Merck and Samsung Bioepis, a unit of Samsung BioLogics Co Ltd. Since it is not possible to make exact copies of complex biotech medicines, which are manufactured from living cells, they cannot be called true generics as with simple pills. Instead, companies must prove their versions are similar enough to the original medicine.

Johnson & Johnson’s shares fell 1.5 pct to $133.21 after South Korea’s Samsung Bioepis said it started U.S sales of the company’s top-selling drug Remicade. Investors are also focusing on the earnings of tech heavyweights as a recent rally in their shares have led to concerns about stretched valuations. However, tech continues to be the best performing S&P; sector this year. “This week is going to be critical to see the passing of the baton from the Fed being the primary driver of the market to corporate fundamentals,” said Matt Miskin, senior capital markets research analyst at John Hancock Investments. Analysts have raised their expectations for S&P; 500 earnings to 8.8 percent, compared with an 8 percent rise projected at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Amazon and Facebook are due to report results later this week. The market will also keep an eye on political developments in Washington, with rising doubts about President Donald Trump’s ability to legislate his pro-growth policies after the failure of the healthcare bill. The International Monetary Fund shaved its forecasts for U.S. growth to 2.1 percent for both 2017 and 2018 from its earlier estimates of 2.3 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, citing lack of details on the Trump administration’s stimulus measures. “For now, better earnings is giving the market the ability to navigate some of the uncertainty that is coming out of Washington but going into next year, the market is likely to become more concerned if policies do not finally come through,” added Miskin. At 11:03 a.m. ET, (1503 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 68.05 points, or 0.32 percent, at 21,512.02, the S&P; 500 was down 5.43 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,467.11. The Nasdaq Composite was down 1.73 points, or 0.03 percent, at 6,386.03. Also weighing on sentiment was a larger-than-expected fall in home resales volumes for June. Nine of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with the utilities and telecommunications leading the decliners. Halliburton was down 2.8 percent after the oilfield services provider warned about flattening growth in North American rig count. Cal-Maine Foods fell 7.8 percent, while Hasbro was down 8.9 percent after reporting their quarterly results. WebMD Health jumped 19.6 percent after KKR agreed to buy the online health publisher in a deal valued at about $2.8 billion. KKR was off 0.3 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,694 to 1,041. On the Nasdaq, 1,507 issues fell and 1,160 advanced.

1214,JNJ,"UPDATE 3-Lazard profit beats on record advisory, asset management revenue","(Reuters) - Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N) reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue on Thursday as it earned more from advising on deals and on strength in its asset management unit. Operating revenue from financial advisory surged 43 percent and asset management jumped 22.3 percent in the quarter, marking the highest ever quarterly revenue for both businesses. Lazard pocketed a market share of 10.7 percent, and ranked No. 9, for completed deals among major advisers globally, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Global M&A; activity has declined ... partly due to uncertainty regarding U.S. policy, but the environment remains favorable. Sentiment continues to be constructive among CEOs and boardrooms around the world,” Chief Executive Kenneth Jacobs said on a post-earnings call. The value of worldwide mergers and acquisitions announced decreased about 6 percent in the quarter. However, Lazard’s operating revenue from M&A; and strategic advisory rose more than 50 percent to $323 million in the second quarter ended June 30. The company advised on deals such as Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) $30 billion acquisition of Actelion ATLN.S and Danone’s (DANO.PA) $12.5 billion acquisition of WhiteWave Foods Co. Lazard has made asset management a bigger part of its business, now accounting for about 43 percent of total revenue. Total assets under management were $226 billion at the end of June, up 5 percent from the end of March, helped by market gains and foreign exchange movement. The company also earned 22 percent more from advising on restructuring.  Lazard benefited from increased restructuring in the retail sector, partly spurred by the growth of Amazon (AMZN.O) and WalMart (WMT.N), company executives said on the call. Net income attributable to Lazard rose to $120.4 million, or 91 cents per share, in the quarter, from $80.4 million, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, the company earned 98 cents per share, handily beating the average analyst estimate of 79 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total operating revenue rose 33 percent to $720.2 million, while analysts had expected $627.1 million. Lazard’s shares were little changed in morning trading on Thursday. As of Wednesday’s close, stock had risen nearly 20 percent this year.

1217,JNJ,J&J; arthritis drug sirukumab raises safety concerns: FDA staff,"(Reuters) - There were more deaths in patients taking Johnson & Johnson’s experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug sirukumab than among those taking a placebo, staff reviewers for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a report published Monday. The report comes two days before an outside committee of advisors meets to discuss the drug and recommend whether it should be approved. The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisers but typically does so. The most common causes of death were major heart problems, infection and malignancies.  Other potential safety issues related to immune system suppression were similar to other products in the class, but the trend of increased overall mortality “seems unique for the sirukumab program,” the report said. It was published on the FDA’s website. Brian Kenney, a J&J; spokesman, said rheumatoid arthritis is a complex and serious disease, with patients frequently cycling through multiple therapies until finding one that may work for them. “We are confident in the benefit-to-risk of sirukumab,” he said. J&J; was originally developing the drug, which would be known as Plivensia if approved, with GlaxoSmithKline Plc. GSK recently said it would end the program and return all rights to J&J.; GSK had rights to the drug in North, Central and South America. Sirukumab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks a cytokine in the body known as interleukin 6 (IL-6), which can contribute to the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disorder that affects more than 1.3 million Americans. Sirukumab is designed to patients who have failed or cannot tolerate one or more disease modifying drug such as methotrexate. Sirukumab would compete with Roche Holding AG’s IL-6 inhibitor Actemra and a recently approved IL-6 therapy, Kevzara, or sarilumab, made by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Analysts on average forecast global sales of Kevzara to reach about $667 million by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data. They expect sales of sirukumab, if approved, to be about $450 million over the same period. Neither Kevzara nor sirukumab are sufficiently different from Actemra to gain a great deal of traction in the market, said Damien Conover, an analyst with Morningstar. “I don’t think they are really going to move the needle for any of these large companies,” he said.

The verdict in U.S. District Court in Jackson, Mississippi, is a blow to thousands of patients with similar allegations against the drugmaker. The jury returned the verdict after just four hours of deliberation.  The companies also won the previous two trials on claims of risks from Xarelto. In the latest case, plaintiff Dora Mingo claimed she suffered acute gastrointestinal bleeding after she was treated with Xarelto for a month in 2015 to prevent blood clotting following an operation.  She accused the drugmakers, who jointly developed the blood thinner, of having failed to warn about the bleeding risks and said her injuries could have been prevented had they provided adequate information. Mingo’s case is among an estimated 18,600 lawsuits in federal and state courts related to Xarelto. The first three cases were chosen to be tried as so-called bellwethers to help both sides assess similar claims, define legal strategies, damages ranges and settlement options.

1230,JNJ,J&J; ordered to pay $417 million in trial over talc cancer risks,"(Reuters) - A California jury on Monday ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $417 million to a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer after using the company’s talc-based products like Johnson’s Baby Powder for feminine hygiene. The Los Angeles Superior Court jury’s verdict in favor of  California resident Eva Echeverria was the largest yet in lawsuits alleging J&J; failed to adequately warn consumers about the cancer risks of its talc-based products. “We are grateful for the jury’s verdict on this matter and that Eva Echeverria was able to have her day in court,” Mark Robinson, her lawyer, said in a statement. The verdict included $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages. It was a major setback for J&J;, which faces 4,800 similar claims nationally and has been hit with over $300 million in verdicts by juries in Missouri. “We will appeal today’s verdict because we are guided by the science, which supports the safety of Johnson’s Baby Powder,” J&J; said. Echeverria’s lawsuit was the first out of hundreds of California talc cases to go to trial. The 63-year-old claimed she developed terminal ovarian cancer after decades of using J&J;’s products. Her lawyers argued J&J; encouraged women to use its products despite knowing of studies linking ovarian cancer to genital talc use. J&J;’s lawyers countered that studies and federal agencies have not found that talc products are carcinogenic. The trial follows five prior ones in Missouri state court, where many lawsuits are pending. J&J; lost four of those trials and, along with a talc supplier, has been hit with $307 million in verdicts.

1234,JNJ,Massive California verdict expands J&J;'s talc battlefield,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A massive California verdict in a lawsuit alleging Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) talc-based products cause cancer has opened a new front in the litigation, upending the company’s hopes that the cases were only gaining traction in Missouri, legal experts said. The $417 million award by California jury to a California resident suggested so-called forum-shopping, in which parties seek to file cases in whichever jurisdictions seem most favorable, may not be the main problem facing J&J; as it wrestles with some 4,800 outstanding talc lawsuits. J&J;, which denies any link between talc and cancer, said in a statement it would appeal Monday’s verdict but declined further comment. That verdict was more than the sum of all the previous talc awards, which totaled $307 million and were meted out by juries in the same state court in St. Louis, Missouri, in cases filed by out-of-state residents. A fourth of talc lawsuits nationally were brought in St. Louis after the first large verdicts there. J&J; has cast the St. Louis court as overly plaintiff-friendly and has focused on getting the cases brought by out-of-state plaintiffs dismissed. “This has very much been about forum shopping,” Howard Erichson, a professor at Fordham School of Law, said about the talc trials. “The fact that there has been a big verdict in California is definitely interesting.” Monday’s verdict in Los Angeles Superior Court came in a case involving a 63-year-old woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer from using Johnson’s Baby Powder for feminine hygiene since childhood.  Corporations have long fought against plaintiffs filing lawsuits in courts favorable to them, and a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June delivered them a big victory, holding that state courts cannot hear claims against companies not based in the state when the alleged injury did not occur there.   J&J; appeared to be an immediate beneficiary of that ruling, which a St. Louis judge cited in declaring a mistrial in a talc case involving two out-of-state women.  The company also said it believed the Supreme Court decision required the reversal of the four St. Louis verdicts.   But legal experts said the verdict in the California case, in which venue was not an issue, could shift the focus back to the evidence. J&J; shares did not react to the verdict. The company has so far not announced a litigation reserve for talc cases and analysts have said they would not be concerned until that happened.       The first talc award against J&J; was handed down in St. Louis state court in February 2016, with the jury ordering J&J; to pay $72 million.  The company prevailed in only one of the four talc trials that followed in the same court, with the other verdicts ranging from $55 million to $110 million. The company has decried the St. Louis court for allowing plaintiffs to present expert testimony linking talc products with cancer that the company contends is speculative and scientifically unsound. It has appeals pending on those grounds.  J&J; has contrasted the Missouri court’s stance to a New Jersey state court ruling in September 2016 that disqualified plaintiffs’ experts, leading to the dismissal of two talc cases. The plaintiffs’ appeal of that ruling is pending. The Los Angeles judge allowed the testimony of some of the same plaintiffs’ experts as in St. Louis.  The California jury seemed to react similarly to the evidence, said Diane Lifton, a defense lawyer not involved in the talc case. “Something clearly inflamed the jury again,” she said. Nathan Schachtman, a product liability defense lawyer, said the California verdict showed that, venue issues aside, the evidence against J&J; was compelling.  “I think it’s a tough case for the defense,” he said.

1235,JNJ,Bavarian Nordic says first milestone payment under J&J; deal could be in 2019,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish biotech company Bavarian Nordic expects to get its first milestone payment under a deal with Janssen Pharmaceuticals in 2019, if clinical trials for vaccines targeting hepatitis B and HIV-1 get underway next year, a company executive said.  Bavarian Nordic last month signed a deal with Janssen, a unit of Johnson & Johnson, with a potential value of up to $879 million including upfront, equity investment and milestone payments. The company will produce clinical material for HIV and hepatitis within the next six to nine months, and Janssen aims to begin clinical trials during 2018. “I think that if the studies get underway next year, the first milestone payment could happen in 2019,” Bavarian’s Chief Financial Officer Ole Larsen told Reuters on Friday.  The company in June posted positive data from a phase 2 study of a universal vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) - a common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Larsen said that with the potential for such a vaccine the company would need to find a commercial partner for that as well.  Still, depending on how the rest of the pipeline develops, Bavarian may begin to develop its own sales force for respiratory diseases in certain smaller regions such as the Nordic countries, Larsen said.  The company expects to begin phase 3 clinical trials for RSV in the autumn of 2019, he said. The company’s shares have risen about 65 percent this year. The next big trigger could be results of a phase 3 trial for prostate cancer drug Prostvac, which according to Larsen are expected in November or December. The company earlier posted second quarter revenue of 397.3 million Danish crowns and maintained its financial expectations for the year.

1239,JNJ,J&J; unit ends hepatitis C drug development in crowded market,"(Reuters) - Janssen Sciences Ireland UC, a unit of Johnson & Johnson, said it would discontinue further development of its hepatitis C research, citing increased availability of a number of effective hepatitis C therapies. Janssen said it would not continue the development of the investigational hepatitis C treatment regimen JNJ-4178, a combination of three direct acting antivirals. The ongoing phase II studies with JNJ-4178 will be completed as planned, with no additional development thereafter, Janssen said in a statement on Monday. Janssen’s hepatitis research and development efforts will continue to focus on chronic hepatitis B, the unit said. Janssen co-developed telaprevir, a first-in-class protease inhibitor used in combination therapy for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus, a few years ago. In collaboration with Medivir AB , Janssen later launched the second-generation protease inhibitor OLYSIO, which is approved in several countries.

1245,JNJ,Pfizer files suit against J&J; over Remicade contracts,"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), saying its rival’s contracts with health insurers for blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, were anticompetitive and blocked sales of Pfizer’s new biosimilar. Pfizer said in the suit that J&J; is offering discounts on its Remicade treatment in exchange for essentially excluding Pfizer’s drug from insurance coverage, keeping it out of the hands of patients. J&J; said in an e-mailed statement that the lawsuit was without merit and that the company is competing on value and price.  “To date Pfizer has failed to demonstrate sufficient value to patients, providers, payers and employers,” said Scott White, President of Janssen Biotech Inc, a unit of J&J.; J&J; signed exclusionary contracts with health insurers, hospitals and doctor groups after U.S. regulators approved it as a reasonable substitute for Remicade in 2016, Pfizer said.  The contracts with insurers  - including UnitedHealth Group (UNH.N), Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), Aetna Inc (AET.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N) - covered about 70 percent of the commercially insured patients in the United States, the lawsuit said. Both Aetna and Anthem declined to comment. Other U.S. insurers contacted for this story did not have an immediate comment. Remicade is an infused treatment for chronic autoimmune disorders and costs about $4,000 per dose, or $26,000 a year, Pfizer said in the suit. Its Inflectra rival is priced 19 percent lower than that list price. But Pfizer said it has not been able to reach customers because of J&J;’s anticompetitive actions. The suit comes at a time when insurers, consumers and the U.S. government have pushed for lower drug prices, saying double-digit annual price increases are unsustainable. Biosimilars are intended to be lower cost alternatives to expensive biotech medicines. But because they are made from living cells and it is not possible to make an exact copy of the branded medicine, they are not automatically substituted for the existing branded drug the way a generic drug would be. Pfizer said in the lawsuit that J&J;’s contracts with many insurers exclusively pay for Remicade and only pay for Inflectra in limited cases where patients “fail first” on Remicade.  In return, Pfizer said, J&J; pays after-market rebates on both new and existing customers’ Remicade purchases. To make up for the J&J; rebates and discounts on this large base of old and new customers, Pfizer said it would need to price Inflectra below its own average variable cost. Pfizer shares were up 1.3 percent, or 45 cents, at $35.90 and J&J; shares fell 1.6 percent, or $2.10, to $133.11.

Its Inflectra rival is priced 19 percent lower than that list price. But Pfizer said it has not been able to reach customers because of J&J;’s anticompetitive actions. The suit comes at a time when insurers, consumers and the U.S. government have pushed for lower drug prices, saying double-digit annual price increases are unsustainable. Biosimilars are intended to be lower cost alternatives to expensive biotech medicines. But because they are made from living cells and it is not possible to make an exact copy of the branded medicine, they are not automatically substituted for the existing branded drug the way a generic drug would be. Pfizer said in the lawsuit that J&J;’s contracts with many insurers exclusively pay for Remicade and only pay for Inflectra in limited cases where patients “fail first” on Remicade.  In return, Pfizer said, J&J; pays after-market rebates on both new and existing customers’ Remicade purchases. To make up for the J&J; rebates and discounts on this large base of old and new customers, Pfizer said it would need to price Inflectra below its own average variable cost. Pfizer shares were up 1.3 percent, or 45 cents, at $35.90 and J&J; shares fell 1.6 percent, or $2.10, to $133.11. The case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

1265,JNJ,Bayer sticks by Xarelto sales estimate despite study setback,"FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Bayer stood by its peak sales estimate for clot prevention drug Xarelto after the pill disappointed in a late-stage trial to test prevention of repeat strokes.

1267,JNJ,"Awaiting better days, multinationals keep Venezuela units alive - barely","VALENCIA, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuelan auto worker Celso Nunez spends his days moonlighting as a mover and trading salvaged building materials in his worn-out red pick-up. His employer, Ford Motor Co (F.N), does not mind. In fact, it is paying him to stay off the job. With Venezuela’s economy in shambles, Ford has furloughed Nunez and 1200 colleagues at its moribund plant here in Valencia, Venezuela’s third-largest city. The company said it wants to call them back when times are better. Nunez hasn’t reported for work in ten months, save for a few days in September to work on a prototype for a new cargo truck. But he still collects a quarter of his weekly salary of 50,000 bolivars, the equivalent of just $1.70 at the widely used black-market exchange rate.  The father of two teenagers counts himself lucky. “Ford has given me stability ... to help my family,” said Nunez, proudly wearing his blue factory shirt after a recent meeting at the plant about the new prototype.  “We know it’s not their fault, it’s the national situation.”  Ford is among roughly 150 multinationals still hanging on in Venezuela. The once-prosperous OPEC nation is now in the fourth year of a recession caused by a fall in oil prices and, economists say, failed policies of its socialist government. A dearth of raw materials and plummeting demand has led many to halt or vastly scale back production, furloughing many employees in a country where labor laws ban mass layoffs. A handful of companies, including Clorox (CLX.N), Kimberly-Clark (KMB.N), General Mills (GIS.N), General Motors (GM.N) and Harvest Natural Resources HNR.N, have given up entirely, abandoning assets or selling them cheap. Most multinationals, however, say they want to keep at least a minimum presence to be ready for a future upturn in Venezuela, home to the world’s largest proven oil reserves. In Valencia, retrenchment by multinationals including Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI), Colgate Palmolive (CL.N), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Nestle SA (NESN.S) have rendered the city a near ghost town.  Last week, Nestle suspended operations at a baby food plant there, blaming a lack of supplies. In a statement, Nestle said it continues to pay the plant’s 80 workers and remains committed to Venezuela and about 3200 employees at other factories there. DUST ON SEMI-ASSEMBLED CARS  At Ford, the company said its Valencia factory had assembled about 400 cars through August of this year, compared with 17,000 units in 2012. Still, the No. 2 U.S. automaker said in an e-mail it “has no plans to leave the country.” The drastically reduced work schedules, it added, is a way to “adapt to the local market’s needs.”  Ford began selling cars in dollars in 2015 so it could buy parts without requesting hard currency via government exchange controls. Other automakers followed suit, but have not been able to sell many cars because few Venezuelans can afford them.  Venezuela’s car assembly output slumped to 2,849 units in 2016 from a record 172,418 units in 2007, according to auto industry group Cavenez. Sales, including imports, plunged to 3,008 last year from 491,899 in 2007.     At dealerships including Ford, Chrysler and Toyota, Venezuelan-made luxury vehicles sit without buyers, priced as much as $20,000 more than in other countries. Costs are inflated by imported parts and few economies of scale, analysts said. To stay afloat in such conditions, Ford and other multinationals have shortened shifts, reduced payrolls and focused on cheaper products, according to unions and company officials.  The cutbacks make for scenes like that at the Fiat Chrysler plant in Valencia, where dust gathers on semi-assembled 2016 Jeep Cherokees, still missing windshields and mirrors.  On a recent day, about 20 employees stood at the entrance to the plant, which sold more than 25,000 units in 2007 but only about 150 this year. About 60 percent of workers stay home, earning a fraction of their salaries. The rest come in but are confined to maintenance and administrative activities, employees and union leaders said. Despite the tough conditions, Fiat Chrysler has told employees it does not plan to close, said Henry Ospina of the Fiat Chrysler union.  “But there is anxiety,” he said. A Fiat Chrysler spokesman said the company was making “its best efforts to keep production at levels adequate to the availability of inputs and components.” The company declined further comment. “PSEUDO-EMPLOYEES,” FREE FOOD  Though many multinational workers said they feel like “pseudo-employees,” they fare better than most unemployed Venezuelans, who struggle to buy food and medicine. Payments from state welfare programs lag the triple-digit inflation. As of April 2016, half of Venezuela’s working population was either jobless or employed only in part-time, “informal” jobs, like street vending, according to the last available official statistics.  Compounding the pain, consumer spending slumped by 15 percent last year and is expected to decline by yet another 25 percent this year, according to local consulting group Ecoanalitica.  Venezuelan businesses are enduring their worst moment in decades, with at least two in every 10 factories halted, according to a Conindustria, the country’s main industry association. President Nicolas Maduro’s government defends policies, like widely-criticized currency controls, that many businesses say wrecked the economy. He blames the halving of international oil prices since 2014, which slashed Venezuela’s revenues.  Maduro also accuses foreign firms of intentionally limiting investment and production as part of an “economic war” waged by political opponents and the United States. The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. At some multinationals, furloughed employees are still allowed to eat lunch at cafeterias of halted plants - a big perk at a time of increasing hunger.  Fiat Chrysler serves up staples like chicken, rice, pasta and plantains daily to 60 of its 800 workers. A schedule prioritizes the neediest. Similar arrangements exist at Colgate-Palmolive and Johnson & Johnson. “It’s one meal I don’t have to pay for at home,” said Pedro Rodriguez, 44, who has worked just six days this year at Fiat Chrysler, his employer of two decades. “There are colleagues who only eat half the meals and take the other half home because the situation is tough.” To get around strict layoff rules, many multinationals have offered voluntary buyouts.     Ford launched a “voluntary separation program” in 2016 that about 800 employees, or 40 percent of its workforce, signed onto. Many use the severance payments to start businesses like bakeries or selling construction materials, workers said.  But many of these ventures are now struggling, too. At Fiat Chrysler, a severance offer included four new tires, each of which is worth the equivalent of a monthly factory wage in Venezuela. As of August, 23 workers had accepted: some planned to sell their tires and use the proceeds to emigrate.     Elsewhere in Valencia, multinationals have struggled to adapt to other government rules, including strict price controls for some products like milk and soap. The prices rarely keep up with inflation.   For instance, a Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N) soap plant has been shut since February. Workers there said company officials told them it could not cover costs if it sold soap at the mandated price, equal to less than $0.01 per soap bar at the black-market exchange rate.   Colgate-Palmolive in Venezuela did not respond to requests for comment.  Workers said Colgate recently restarted production of price-controlled toothpaste, packaged in brown cardboard. The recycled boxes are cheaper than its usual red packaging.  Earlier, it stopped producing children’s flavors and toothpaste with whitener, reducing its portfolio of 300 products to less than a dozen, said union representative Felix Bello.     Johnson & Johnson, which once sold everything from mouthwash to moisturizers, now only produces panty liners, a feminine hygiene product.     Still, the U.S. drugmaker agreed not to lay off any of its 157 Venezuelan factory employees.  Only three of the factory’s seven production lines are in operation, said union representative Jaime Guevara. Workers not on the production line do maintenance work.     “Johnson & Johnson has a responsibility to our employees and the communities in which we live and work,” a company spokeswoman said.

1268,JNJ,Bayer says Phase III Xarelto study halted early,"BERLIN, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Bayer and partner Johnson & Johnson suffered a setback for blockbuster clot prevention drug Xarelto, with the German company saying a Phase III study had been halted early after the drug showed no efficacy improvements over low-dose aspirin. The final stage study was evaluating the efficacy and safety of Xarelto, also known as rivaroxaban, for the secondary prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with a recent embolic stroke of undetermined source. “While bleeding rates were low overall, an increase in bleeding was observed in the rivaroxaban arm compared to the low dose aspirin arm,” Bayer, which invented aspirin, said in a statement late on Thursday. Xarelto was jointly developed by Bayer and J&J;, which owns the U.S. rights to the drug. The drug is already approved for a number of cardiovascular conditions. Prevention of strokes caused by atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heart beat common among the elderly, is the main profit driver. Bayer said the trial has no bearing on the positive benefits of Xarelto for other uses for which it is currently licensed. Xarelto is Bayer’s best-selling drug and in 2016 contributed 2.9 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in revenues to its pharmaceutical business. Bayer estimates annual peak sales potential estimate for Xarelto of more than 5 billion euros.

Investors also awaited the release of the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s September policy meeting. J&J; rose about 2 percent after Jefferies upgraded the stock to “buy”, saying the company’s pharma division would help it top analysts’ profit estimates. The consumer staples sector got a boost from gains in Wal-Mart as well as from Kroger, which jumped 4.4 percent after news that it was exploring the sale of its nearly 800 convenience stores. The focus will now shift to JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, which report results on Thursday, with analysts warning that bank results will largely be held back by a lack of volatility, compared with a year earlier. “Third quarter results of large banks are expected to be tepid,” said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research. “Trading revenue (will be) down due to low volatility and loan growth remaining flat to slightly negative.” With the S&P; 500 up 14 percent in 2017, investors are betting on strong earnings growth across the S&P; 500. “Valuations are full, but not stretched at this point in time,” said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Helena, Montana. “But that won’t be the lever that drives equity market returns, it does require earnings growth to support performance.” At 12:39 p.m. ET (1639 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 21.42 points, or 0.09 percent, at 22,852.1, the S&P; 500 was up 2.12 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,552.76 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 7.35 points, or 0.11 percent, at 6,594.60. Six of the 11 major S&P; indexes were lower, led by a 0.6 percent drop in telecom services index. Financial stocks were under pressure from a slight drop in U.S. Treasury yields ahead of the release of Fed minutes, due at 2:00 p.m. ET, and auctions of three-year and 10-year notes. Worried by signs the U.S. economy had peaked, the Fed has slowed since raising rates twice within three months at the start of this year, but has signaled one more hike is still on the cards by the end of 2017. General Electric slipped about 1 percent after JPMorgan said a dividend cut was “increasingly likely” and lowered its price target on the stock. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,604 to 1,191. On the Nasdaq, 1,495 issues rose and 1,285.

1274,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson wins reversal of $72 million verdict over talc cancer risks,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday won the reversal of a $72 million verdict in favor of the family of a woman whose death from ovarian cancer they claimed stemmed from her use of the company’s talc-based products like Johnson’s Baby Powder. The Missouri Court of Appeals, Eastern District said that given a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that limited where injury lawsuits could be filed, the case over Alabama resident Jacqueline Fox’s death should not have been tried in St. Louis. The February 2016 verdict for Fox’s family was the first of four jury awards totaling $307 million in state court in St. Louis to plaintiffs who accused J&J; of not adequately warning consumers about the cancer risks of its talc-based products. J&J; says it faces lawsuits by 4,800 plaintiffs nationally asserting similar claims over its talc-based products. Many of those cases are in Missouri, where J&J; won one trial, and in California, where in August a jury awarded a woman $417 million. The Missouri cases, which have largely been brought by out-of-state plaintiffs, have faced jurisdictional questions after the Supreme Court issued a ruling in June that limited where personal injury lawsuits could be filed. In a decision in a case involving Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, the Supreme Court said state courts could not hear claims by non-residents who were not injured in that particular state or if the defendant company was not based in that state.  The three-judge Missouri appellate panel cited that decision in its ruling in the case of Fox, who died four months before trial and who was one of 65 plaintiffs in her specific lawsuit, only two of whom were Missouri residents. The cases of Fox and other plaintiffs from outside the state were joined with those of plaintiffs from Missouri, though each case resulting in a verdict has been tried individually. “The fact that resident plaintiffs sustained similar injuries does not support specific jurisdiction as to non-resident claims,” Judge Lisa Van Amburg wrote. Lawyers for Fox’s family say the Alabama resident died in 2015 at age of 62 after using J&J;’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower for more than 35 years. J&J; sold Shower to Shower to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc in 2012. J&J; in a statement said it was pleased with the ruling. The $72 million awarded to Fox by jurors included $10 million in compensatory damages and $62 million in punitive damages.  Shares of J&J;, which also reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and raised its outlook on Tuesday, jumped 3.2 percent to $140.49 in afternoon trading.

1276,JNJ,New cancer drugs help Johnson & Johnson top profit estimates,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson posted better-than-expected third-quarter earnings, raising its full-year forecast due to growth from new cancer drugs and high-margin treatments picked up in its $30 billion acquisition of Actelion earlier this year. Shares of J&J;, part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, rose 3.4 percent to $140.79 on Tuesday.  The shares have traded at or near record levels for much of the year. Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler said the stock has historically done well when its high-margin pharmaceuticals business is the main driver of growth, rather than its consumer segment. Sales at J&J;’s pharmaceuticals segment rose 15.4 percent to $9.7 billion in the third quarter. Around half of that growth came from the Actelion deal. Higher demand for J&J;’s blood cancer drugs, Darzalex and Imbruvica, and Actelion’s rare diseases treatments are expected to boost earnings going forward. The two cancer drugs should continue to capture market share, Guggenheim Securities’ Butler said. “The oncology business is doing exceptionally well,” he said. “It’s really hard to figure out where that stops for both Darzalex and Imbruvica.” Still, sales of J&J;’s diabetes drug, Invokana, slipped around 10 percent from the second quarter. The company this year was required to add new warnings about the risk of foot and leg amputations and also has had to contend with competition from Eli Lilly and Co’s Jardiance.  Its rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, also had weaker sales in the quarter. J&J; said adjusted earnings, excluding one-time items, rose 13 percent to $1.90 per share. Analysts on average were expecting an adjusted profit of $1.80 per share , according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at J&J;’s consumer products segment, which makes Band-Aids, Neutrogena beauty products and Tylenol, rose 2.9 percent to $3.4 billion. The company’s net earnings fell to $3.76 billion, or $1.37 per share, in the quarter from $4.27 billion, or $1.53 per share, a year earlier.

1287,JNJ,California judge tosses $417 million talc cancer verdict against Johnson & Johnson,"(Reuters) - A California judge on Friday threw out a $417 million verdict against Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) in a lawsuit by a woman who claimed she developed ovarian cancer after using its talc-based products like Johnson’s Baby Powder for feminine hygiene. The ruling by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Maren Nelson marked the latest setback facing women and family members who accuse J&J; of not adequately warning consumers about the cancer risks of its talc-based products.    The decision followed a jury’s decision in August to hit J&J; with the largest verdict to date in the litigation, awarding California resident Eva Echeverria $70 million in compensatory damages and $347 million in punitive damages. Nelson on Friday reversed the jury verdict and granted J&J;’s request for a new trial. Nelson said the August trial was underpinned by errors and insufficient evidence on both sides, culminating in excessive damages. Mark Robinson, who represented the woman in her lawsuit, in a statement said he would file an appeal immediately. “We will continue to fight on behalf of all women who have been impacted by this dangerous product,” he said. J&J; in a statement said it was pleased with the verdict, adding that it will continue to defend itself in additional trials. The judge added that there also had been misconduct of the jury during the trial.  J&J; said declarations by two jurors after the trial showed that three members of the 12-person jury who voted against finding the company liable were improperly excluded from determining damages. J&J; says it faces lawsuits by 4,800 plaintiffs nationally asserting talc-related claims. Many of those cases are in California, where Echeverria’s case was the first to go to trial, and in Missouri, where J&J; has faced five trials. The Missouri litigation led to four verdicts against J&J; in which juries issued verdicts totaling $307 million. The company has only won one trial. But the Missouri cases, which have largely been brought by out-of-state plaintiffs, have faced jurisdictional questions after the Supreme Court issued a ruling in June that limited where personal injury lawsuits could be filed.

1290,JNJ,Exclusive: Pfizer to launch consumer health sale in November - sources,"LONDON (Reuters) - Pfizer plans to kick off an auction process for its consumer healthcare business in November, paving the way for a potential $15 billion-plus sale of the headache pill to lip balm business, sources close to the matter told Reuters. Several global companies, including GlaxoSmithKline and Reckitt Benckiser, have expressed interest in bidding for the unit, which had sales of about $3.4 billion in 2016. The prospective sale, which is being led by Centerview Partners, Guggenheim Securities and Morgan Stanley, was first mooted on Oct. 10, when Pfizer said it was considering strategic options for the unit. But preliminary discussions with interested parties including Reckitt have already taken place, one of the sources said, adding the U.S. drugmaker wants to get the ball rolling before the end of this year. GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley confirmed on Wednesday she would look “carefully” at the business.  Three people familiar with the situation said the British drugmaker had hired Citi to represent it in the auction. GSK declined to comment while Citi was not immediately available. Other possible bidders could include Procter & Gamble, Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson and Nestle, several sources said. Pfizer plans to send out financial information about the consumer unit to prospective buyers in around three weeks time, one of the sources said.  The process is expected to heat up early next year as bids come in and a deal could be sealed around the middle of 2018, the source said. Germany’s Merck KGaA is also looking to divest its consumer health business and has hired JP Morgan to sell the unit, best known for making Seven Seas vitamins. Some banking and industry sources said Merck could put the divestment on hold since the sale, estimated to be worth around $4.5 billion, risked being eclipsed by the Pfizer auction. One source said Pfizer believed keen competition would allow it to raise at least $20 billion from the sale of the business, whose well-known brands include painkiller Advil, Centrum multivitamins and lip balm Chapstick. As aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication, the consumer health sector has proved a fertile ground for deal-making in recent years. But the industry remains fragmented and GSK’s Walmsley said she expected more merger activity, with GSK in a strong position to act as a “consolidator”. Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very long-lasting brands with loyal customers. Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said he was considering the sale of consumer healthcare because it was not integral to the core prescription drug business and might be worth more outside the group. GSK has taken a different view, opting to retain a diverse portfolio in which consumer health offers a hedge against riskier prescription drugs. For Reckitt, meanwhile, over-the-counter medicines offer higher-margin growth than its household business. Chief Executive Rakesh Kapoor, who last week announced plans to separate Reckitt into health and home and hygiene divisions, said he would weigh a bid if Pfizer’s strategic review resulted in a sale. Nestle could also enter the fight and use the Pfizer consumer business as a platform to expand the intersection of food and healthcare, sources said. The Swiss group has previously identified consumer healthcare as a sector of interest.

1293,JNJ,J&J;'s Stelara shows promise against lupus in study,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s blockbuster psoriasis drug Stelara led to a significant reduction in disease activity in patients with systemic lupus compared with a placebo in a midstage clinical trial, according to data released on Saturday. Stelara, a biotech drug known chemically as ustekinumab, is already approved for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease and had third-quarter sales of $1.12 billion.  In the trial of 102 patients with active lupus despite being on standard therapy, 60 percent of those who received Stelara experienced improvement on a scale that measures disease activity after 24 weeks of treatment. That compared with improvement in 31 percent of patients who received a placebo on top of standard medicines, such as steroids or immunosuppressive drugs, the company reported.  Dr. Ronald van Vollenhoven, the study’s lead investigator, called the results “pretty exciting and encouraging,” adding that Stelara’s known safety profile provided added comfort.  J&J; said the results were strong enough to advance Stelara into larger Phase III testing. There has only been one new drug approved for lupus in the last 50 years, GSK’s Benlysta. “Any new treatment for lupus is going to be very welcomed by patients and physicians,” said van Vollenhoven, who was scheduled to present the data at a rheumatology meeting in San Diego on Tuesday. Lupus is a debilitating and sometimes fatal chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder that can affect the joints, skin, heart, lungs, kidneys and brain. An estimated 1.5 million Americans and 5 million people worldwide have the disease which disproportionately affects women. On some secondary measures of disease activity, such as Physician Global Assessment, Stelara failed to achieve statistical significance over placebo but showed a trend in the right direction, researchers reported. Stelara did lead to significantly fewer disease flare-ups. Van Vollenhoven said trials for potential new lupus treatments were notoriously difficult because of the way disease activity tends to come and go and because Stelara can affect patients differently.   The J&J; drug was given intravenously at the start of the trial and then by subcutaneous injections every eight weeks. It works by blocking two proteins believed to play an important role in the immune system’s inflammatory process. Safety was similar in the two groups with serious adverse events reported in 8.3 percent of Stelara patients and 9.5 percent of the placebo group.

1297,JNJ,Bayer in bid to broaden use of anti-clotting drug Xarelto,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer on Monday moved to tap a potentially lucrative new market opportunity for its blockbuster clot prevention drug Xarelto, requesting approval in Europe to make atherosclerosis patients eligible for treatment.  Xarelto is already approved for a number of cardiovascular conditions and prevention of strokes caused by atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heart beat common among the elderly, is the main profit driver. The drug, in which partner Johnson & Johnson holds U.S. marketing rights, was earlier this year shown to cut the risk of potentially deadly strokes and heart attacks in patients with severe atherosclerosis by 24 percent, raising the prospects of billions more in sales.

That would come on top of a population of roughly 25 million patients in atrial fibrillation. In the irregular heart beat market, Xarelto is head to head with rival pill Eliquis, owned by Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb, and also competes with Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa, but none of them has been tested in the atherosclerosis setting.

1301,JNJ,Exclusive: Carlyle explores sale or IPO of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics - sources,"(Reuters) - Private equity firm Carlyle Group LP is exploring a sale or initial public offering of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Inc, a U.S. diagnostics company that could be valued at more than $7 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said. A divestment of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, which Carlyle acquired from Johnson & Johnson in 2014 for $4 billion, would show how buyout firms can turn unloved businesses of major corporations into lucrative investments within a few years. Carlyle has hired investment banks to run a sale process for Ortho-Clinical, the sources said this week. Carlyle may also pursue an IPO of the company if the offers it receives do not meet valuation expectations, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.  Carlyle declined to comment. Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics did not respond to a request for comment. Headquartered in Raritan, New Jersey, Ortho-Clinical produces in-vitro diagnostics equipment and associated assays and reagents. It generates about $1.7 billion in annual revenue and employs about 4,300 people worldwide, according to its website. Ortho-Clinical has incurred significant expenses in the last three years to find its footing as a standalone company. These implementation and restructuring costs are expected to taper off by the end of the year, as it severs most of its ties with Johnson & Johnson, according to credit ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service Inc. The company sells its products in more than 125 countries, but has potential to grow in emerging markets, according to Moody’s. Any deal for Ortho-Clinical would likely come in the first half of 2018, making it one of the first major Carlyle portfolio companies to be divested under the leadership of Glenn Youngkin and Kewsong Lee, who are set to become co-chief executive officers of Carlyle in January, taking over the reins from founders David Rubenstein, William Conway and Daniel D’Aniello. Carlyle has a long track record of investing in healthcare companies and has been seeking to cash out on some of them this year.

1303,JNJ,Janssen drops U.S. lawsuit against Samsung Bioepis' Remicade copy,"SEOUL (Reuters) - A unit of healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson has dropped a lawsuit it filed to block a copy of its rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade produced by South Korea’s Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd from being sold in the United States.  Janssen Biotech Inc, in a document to the U.S. District Court of New Jersey dated Friday and seen by Reuters, voluntarily dismissed its suit to block Samsung Bioepis’ biosimilar of Remicade from sale.  Remicade is Johnson & Johnson’s biggest selling drug, with U.S. sales of about $5 billion a year.  Janssen had filed the suit in May to investigate whether the South Korean firm violated its manufacturing process patents.  The dismissal was “with prejudice,” meaning Janssen is barred from bringing a new case against Samsung Bioepis on the same basis.  A Janssen spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment.  “Janssen’s withdrawal of the lawsuit marks a positive step towards improving patient access to biosimilars in the United States,” Samsung Bioepis spokesman Mingi Hyun said on Tuesday.   Merck & Co and Samsung Bioepis, part of South Korea’s top conglomerate Samsung Group, launched in July their less expensive alternative version of Remicade, which is marketed as Renflexis in the United States.

1304,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson hit with $247 million verdict in hip implant trial,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal jury in Dallas on Thursday ordered Johnson & Johnson and its DePuy Orthopaedics unit to pay $247 million to six patients who said they were injured by defective Pinnacle hip implants. Delivering a third straight win to patients, the jury found that the metal-on-metal hip implants were defectively designed and that the companies failed to warn consumers about the risks. Six New York residents implanted with the devices said they experienced tissue death, bone erosion and other injuries they blamed on design flaws. J&J;, which faces more than 9,700 Pinnacle lawsuits in state and federal courts across the United States, said in a statement it would immediately begin the appeal process. A DePuy spokeswoman said the company was still “committed to the long-term defense of the allegations in these lawsuits,” adding that the metal-on-metal hip implants were backed by a strong record of clinical data showing they were effective. Plaintiffs claimed the companies falsely promoted the device, most commonly used to treat joint failure caused by osteoarthritis, by saying it lasted longer than similar implants that include ceramic or plastic materials. “We thank this jury for sending a very strong message about the responsibility the defendants have to take care of their consumers,” Mark Lanier, who represented the New York patients, said in a statement.  Thursday’s verdict came in the fourth test trial over the devices in Dallas federal court, where some 9,000 of the cases are pending. Test cases have been selected for trial, and their outcomes will help gauge the value of the remaining claims and inform potential settlement talks. J&J; won the first Pinnacle test trial in 2014, but subsequent juries determined the companies to be liable.  “This nine-week trial was a disservice to everyone involved because the verdict will do nothing to advance the ultimate resolution of this six-year old litigation,” attorney John Beisner, who represented the companies, said in a statement. He said the firms would seek further appellate guidance. A jury in March 2016 awarded five Texas plaintiffs $500 million in damages. That award was later cut to $150 million. J&J; and DePuy were also found liable at a trial in March, during which a jury awarded six California patients $1 billion - a verdict that was later reduced to $543 million. DePuy ceased selling the metal-on-metal Pinnacle devices in 2013 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration strengthened its artificial hip regulations.

1305,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson wins California lawsuit claiming asbestos in talc caused cancer,"(Reuters) - A California jury on Thursday ruled in favor of Johnson & Johnson in a lawsuit by a woman who said she developed the cancer mesothelioma after being exposed to asbestos in the company’s talc-based products including J&J;’s Baby Powder. The Los Angeles Superior Court jury’s verdict came in the first trial centering on claims that J&J;’s talc products contained asbestos. J&J; is separately battling thousands of cases claiming those products can also cause ovarian cancer. The verdict came in a lawsuit by Tina Herford, who said she developed mesothelioma after using J&J; talcum powder products that her lawyers claimed contained asbestos. Reuters watched the verdict through an online broadcast by Courtroom View Network. The jury also found in favor of talc supplier Imerys Talc. J&J; in a statement welcomed the verdict. J&J; said it believed that setbacks dealt to individuals pursuing ovarian cancer cases had “forced plaintiff attorneys to pivot to yet another baseless theory.” “Johnson’s Baby Powder has been around since 1894 and it does not contain asbestos or cause mesothelioma or ovarian cancer,” J&J; said. Chris Panatier, Herford’s lawyer, in an email cautioned against reading too much into a single verdict. “It is a matter of time before juries begin holding them to account,” he said. The verdict came as a federal jury, separately, ordered J&J; to pay $247 million to six patients who said they were injured by defective Pinnacle hip implants. Mesothelioma is a deadly form of cancer closely associated with exposure to asbestos. It affects the delicate tissue that lines body cavities, most often around the lungs, but also in the abdomen and elsewhere.  Herford’s lawyers contended that internal J&J; documents showed the New Jersey-based company for decades was aware of the presence of asbestos in the talc that was used in its products but kept selling them anyway. J&J; faces lawsuits by around 5,500 plaintiffs nationally asserting talc-related claims, largely based on claims it failed to warn women about the risk of developing ovarian cancer from the products. In five trials in Missouri involving ovarian cancer lawsuits, juries found J&J; liable four times and awarded the plaintiffs $307 million. In California, a jury awarded a now-deceased woman $417 million. But in October, J&J; scored major victories when a Missouri appellate court threw out the first verdict there for $72 million and a California judge tossed the $417 million verdict.

1310,JNJ,Johnson & Johnson drug succeeds in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients: study,"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s blockbuster multiple myeloma drug Darzalex when added to a standard therapy regimen reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 50 percent compared with  standard therapy alone in patients not previously treated for the blood cancer, according to data released on Tuesday. The data could lead to expanded approvals of the Darzalex combination as an initial, or first-line, therapy for multiple myeloma, providing a larger sales opportunity for the medicine, one of J&J;’s most important growth drivers.     Darzalex, a biotech drug known chemically as daratumumab, is already approved in combination with other medicines or alone in patients who had received one or more prior treatment regimens. The drug had third-quarter sales of $317 million, with annual sales forecast to reach about $5 billion by 2021, according to Thomson Reuters data. J&J; has applied for expanded U.S and European approvals for the Darzalex combination to treat newly diagnosed patients, Genmab, which licensed the drug to J&J;, said on Tuesday. In the first-line study, 706 patients deemed not eligible for bone marrow transplants received either Darzalex with Takeda Pharmaceutical’s Velcade, the chemotherapy melphalan and the steroid prednisone or the combination without Darzalex. The trial was primarily conducted in Europe using the standard first-line regimen there. Celgene Corp’s Revlimid is typically part of the standard U.S. regimen.   The median time until disease worsening, known as progression-free survival (PFS), was 18.1 months for the standard regimen, while fewer than half in the Darzalex group had experienced disease progression after two years of treatment, according to a summary of data to be presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) meeting in Atlanta next month. The superior PFS with Darzalex was driven by more patients achieving greater responses, including a significantly higher number of complete responses, researchers concluded. The overall response rate was 90.9 percent for the Darzalex group versus 73.9 percent for the control group. Complete responses, meaning no detectable cancer in the blood or bone marrow, were reported in 42.6 percent of Darzalex patients versus 24.4 percent for the standard regimen. Overall survival data was not yet available. About 71 percent of Darzalex patients had what was deemed a very good partial response versus 49.7 percent for the other regimen.  There was a higher rate of serious infections in the Darzalex group - 23.1 percent vs 14.7 percent.

1317,JNJ,Genmab and Johnson & Johnson 'love' partnership as some ponder takeover,"LONDON (Reuters) - Genmab (GEN.CO) was Europe’s second biggest biotech company, until its partner Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) bought Switzerland’s Actelion for $30 billion this year and propelled the Danish antibody specialist to the top spot. Now some investors wonder if the same fate might await Genmab, worth $12 billion, given the soaraway success of its blood cancer drug Darzalex. J&J; sells the drug and pays Genmab a royalty of 12 to 20 percent. With 2017 Darzalex sales already over $1 billion and analysts on average expecting them to reach more than $8 billion annually, those royalties are adding up to serious money. Bernstein analyst Wimal Kapadia is among those who think J&J; might just decide to buy Genmab and avoid royalties altogether, while bringing onboard a smart team of scientists. For now, however, both J&J; and Genmab are lauding the success of their existing relationship. “It’s one of the most successful collaborations we have. We love the partnership,” J&J;’s Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels told Reuters. He declined to comment on the U.S. healthcare giant’s possible interest in buying Genmab in future but said the Danish group had the capital needed to go forward on its own, adding: “They don’t need us to be successful.” Indeed, Genmab’s strategy is to plough the growing royalty stream from Darzalex into its next wave of medicines. Darzalex is now established as a key treatment in multiple myeloma, where it is moving into earlier stages of the disease. It is also showing promise in other areas, with clinical trial success in fighting amyloidosis, a rare disease caused by the build-up of an abnormal protein, triggering a $20 million milestone payment from J&J; to Genmab on Wednesday. [nASB0BVU4] Genmab Chief Executive Jan van de Winkel says the decision on any eventual sale of the company will be up to shareholders, but he is confident the fast-growing biotech business has a bright future as an independent operation. “Our focus is to build an independent antibody innovation powerhouse and we think we can create more value for our stakeholders by staying independent than being a part of a larger entity,” he said in an interview in London. Van de Winkel also sees important differences between Genmab and Actelion, with the decision by J&J; to snap up the Swiss group driven in large part by a need to plug a revenue hole left by declining sales of J&J;’s ageing biotech drug Remicade. “They needed to replace that income and that is exactly what the Actelion products will do. That is a completely different reason, I think, from potentially looking at a company like ours,” he said. “It is up to J&J; ... but I hope that we can continue like this for many, many more years.” ",12012017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-genmab-johnson-johnson/genmab-and-johnson-johnson-love-partnership-as-some-ponder-takeover-idUSKBN1DU1IZ

With this collaboration, Idorsia Chief Scientific Officer Martine Clozel is sticking to a disease specialty — hypertension — that she focused on to build up Actelion in the 1990s to its $30 billion sale to J&J; earlier this year. “Janssen has recognized the potential of aprocitentan, the latest product from a research effort that was initiated nearly 30 years ago,” Clozel, who with her husband Jean-Paul is a co-founder of Idorsia, said in a statement. Following the announcement, Idorsia shares were seen rising 3.9 percent according to premarket indicators. Idorsia’s shares have doubled since beginning trading in June.

1320,JNJ,"Jury orders Bayer, J&J; to pay $28 million in Xarelto lawsuit","(Reuters) - A Philadelphia state court jury on Tuesday ordered Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson to pay $27.8 million to an Indiana couple over the drugmakers’ failure to warn of internal bleeding risks from their blood thinner Xarelto. The jury slapped the companies, which jointly developed the blockbuster drug, with $1.8 million in compensatory and $26 million in punitive damages, according to the couple’s lawyer.  The verdict marks the first trial loss in litigation over Xarelto. Bayer and J&J; have won three previous cases in federal court. Bayer in a statement said it believed there was no basis for the verdict, including the punitive damages award, and said it was going to appeal the verdict. Janssen, J&J;’s pharmaceutical subsidiary, in a statement also said it was going to appeal the verdict, adding that it contradicted years of scientific data and repeated confirmations of Xarelto’s safety by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “Xarelto is the worst in class of the new blood thinners,” Michael Weinkowitz, the couple’s lawyer, said in a statement. “The serious health complications suffered by thousands of patients could have been avoided if physicians were properly instructed about the risks.” Lynn Hartman and her husband had sued the drugmakers in 2015.  Hartman was prescribed Xarelto to prevent strokes as a result of atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat. She took the drug for approximately one year and in June 2014 was hospitalized with severe gastrointestinal bleeding, which she blamed on Xarelto. She has since recovered.  The trial was the first of roughly 1,400 Xarelto cases pending in the Philadelphia court. More than 18,500 cases are pending in federal court, where they are consolidated in a multidistrict litigation at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Federal juries have cleared the companies of liability in three previous trials. The latest verdict in the federal litigation came down in August in the case of a Mississippi woman. Xarelto is Bayer’s best-selling drug and in 2016 contributed 2.9 billion euros ($3.41 billion) in revenues to the German group’s pharmaceutical business. J&J; in 2016 reported $2.2 billion in revenues from Xarelto. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Xarelto in 2011. The drug is prescribed for people with atrial fibrillation and to treat and reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms.

1333,JNJ,$11 billion biotech binge fuels forecasts of 2018 M&A; surge,"LONDON (Reuters) - An $11 billion (8.12 billion pounds) burst of biotech bids in just four days has fuelled expectations of a 2018 surge in life science deals as large drugmakers shop for promising assets from smaller rivals. Separate reports on Monday by consultancy EY and law firm Baker McKenzie both predict a significant rise in mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) this year, helped by U.S. tax changes that may lift big companies’ appetite for deals. Celgene’s (CELG.O) up to $7 billion agreed takeover of Impact Biomedicines, Novo Nordisk’s (NOVOb.CO) $3.1 billion offer for Ablynx (ABLX.BR) and Takeda Pharmaceutical’s (4502.T) plan to buy TiGenix (G9U.BR) for $630 million have already got 2018 off to a flying start. This follows a relatively subdued 2017, when total life sciences M&A; totalled around $200 billion, dominated by Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) $30 billion purchase of Actelion and Gilead’s (GILD.O) $12 billion acquisition of Kite. EY is confident this year’s deal value will exceed $200 billion, given companies’ increased financial firepower and balance sheet strength. There is also substantial pent-up demand, with 60 percent of life sciences executives surveyed in October 2017 planning to actively pursue M&A; in the next 12 months, compared with 46 percent in April. Baker McKenzie, meanwhile, predicts global healthcare M&A; could rise 50 percent in 2018, with North America accounting for well over half of transactions. Driving the demand is the increasingly pivotal role of biotech firms in discovering the drugs of tomorrow. “I believe you will see a higher proportion of innovation at an industry level — and also at Novo Nordisk — coming from external resources,” Novo’s Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard told Reuters. “Ablynx is an example of strong technology development occurring in a smaller biotech setting, with considerable speed and a lack of some of the bureaucracy you can get at large pharma companies.” U.S. drug approvals hit a 21-year high in 2017, with 46 novel medicines winning a green light and a growing share of new products coming from younger biotech companies. For large drugmakers, as well as big biotech businesses like Gilead and Celgene, small and innovative upstarts are now a vital source of experimental drugs with which to top up in-house development pipelines. Pricing pressures on established medicines for conditions like diabetes and respiratory disorders, as well as patent expiries on yesterday’s blockbusters, are driving big players into niche disease areas where biotech groups often excel, according to Edison analyst and former fund manager Andy Smith. “The pressures at big pharma look to be increasing and 90 percent of prescriptions in the U.S. are now for generics, so that pushes companies to look at cutting-edge therapies and it takes them straight into the biotech wheelhouse,” he said. Whether 2018 will turn out to be a golden year for biotech M&A; remains to be seen, but investors like event-driven hedge fund Case Equity Partners have high hopes for the drugs sector, following recent implementation of U.S. tax changes. “U.S. companies with lots of cash trapped overseas can now put capital to work in the global M&A; market more easily. We hence expect 2018 to be immensely active with multiple competitive auctions at significant premia,” the fund said in a an end-of-year letter. Although bankers say the U.S. tax overhaul and particularly a lower tax rate for the repatriation of cash held offshore has so far had limited impact on deal negotiations, they believe companies may decide to allocate more cash to M&A; in 2018. The M&A; outlook is likely to be a hot topic at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference starting on Monday in San Francisco, when many biotech deals and alliances are often announced.

1334,JNJ,"Bayer, J&J; win reversal of $28 million verdict in Xarelto lawsuit","(Reuters) - A Pennsylvania state court judge on Tuesday overturned a $27.8 million jury award to an Indiana couple who accused Bayer AG and Johnson & Johnson of failing to warn of internal bleeding risks of their drug Xarelto, the companies said. Judge Michael Erdos, in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, ruled following a hearing on the drugmakers’ motion to reverse the December verdict, which was their first trial loss in litigation over the blood thinner, the companies said. J&J;’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc unit and Bayer, which jointly developed Xarelto, in separate statements welcomed the decision and said they will continue to defend against the allegations in related litigation. “Bayer stands behind the safety and efficacy of Xarelto and will continue to vigorously defend it,” Bayer said in a statement. The verdict came in a lawsuit by Lynn Hartman, who was prescribed Xarelto to prevent strokes as a result of atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat. Hartman said that she took the drug for approximately one year and in June 2014 was hospitalized with severe gastrointestinal bleeding, which she blamed on Xarelto. She has since recovered. Hartman and her husband sued the drugmakers in 2015. A jury in December awarded $1.8 million in compensatory damages and $26 million in punitive damages. The lawsuit was one of around 21,400 that J&J; says are pending in federal and state courts blaming injuries on Xarelto. The trial was the first to result from roughly 1,400 Xarelto cases pending in the Philadelphia court.  Michael Weinkowitz, a lawyer for the couple, said the decision related to a “very narrow issue related to Mrs. Hartman’s prescribing physician.” He said he looked forward to trying the next series of Xarelto-related cases in Philadelphia. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Xarelto in 2011. It is prescribed for people with atrial fibrillation, a common heart rhythm disorder, and to treat and reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolisms.  But plaintiffs contend Xarelto was unreasonably dangerous and that J&J; and Bayer failed to warn patients about a serious risk of uncontrollable, irreversible bleeding in emergencies.

1337,JNJ,Exclusive: J&J; attracts Chinese interest for diabetes business in potential $3-4 billion deal - sources,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese bidders are circling a diabetes care business owned by the world’s largest healthcare company Johnson & Johnson in a deal that could fetch up to $4 billion, five people with direct knowledge told Reuters.  New Brunswick, N.J.-based J&J; said in January last year it was evaluating options for its diabetes care companies, specifically LifeScan Inc, Animas Corp, and Calibra Medical Inc. One option was a sale of the business, it said. Chinese interest in the J&J; unit comes as the market for diabetes care in China is expected to grow rapidly. Almost one in three of the world’s diabetes sufferers lives in China, according to World Health Organization estimates. Among the potential bidders is a consortium being formed by Shenzhen-listed Sinocare Inc, which develops and manufactures blood sugar monitoring systems, and China Jianyin Investment Ltd (JIC), a unit of sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp. The group has hired an advisor to work on a bid, according to two sources. “The evaluation of potential strategic options for LifeScan Inc. and Calibra Medical Inc. is ongoing and we do not have an announcement regarding these businesses at this time,” J&J; said in a statement in response to Reuters request for comment.  The company has hired Goldman Sachs to work on the sale, according to three of the people. The bank declined to comment. Sinocare’s investors relations office said it could not confirm the information when contacted by Reuters. JIC and CIC did not respond to requests for comment. The sources declined to be identified. Asia accounts for more than 60 percent of global diabetes cases, with increasing levels of wealth, unhealthy diets and more sedentary lifestyles sparking “diabetes epidemics” in the region, according to BMI Research. George Lin, chief financial officer of Hua Medicine, a diabetes-focused drug developer, told Reuters on Wednesday that according to the most recent market research there were more than 110 million diabetes patients in China alone. “The market right now in the world is already close to $50 billion,” he said, referring to diabetes drugs. “In China, it is expected to grow from $6.6 billion in 2016 to $20 billion by 2025. This is a very large, fast-growing market.” Lin left a senior role at Bank of America Merrill Lynch to join Hua in December.     It is not yet clear if potential Chinese buyers are interested in the whole of J&J;’s diabetes care business or one or more of the member companies. Sinocare, which has a market capitalization of about $1.8 billion, in 2015 teamed up with Citic Securities to bid for Bayer’s diabetes devices business that was eventually sold to Japan’s Panasonic Healthcare Holdings, majority-owned by U.S. investment firm KKR.  JIC, wholly owned by CIC, mainly invests in the industrial manufacturing, consumption and information technology sectors, according to its website. CIC’s vice-chairman and president, Tu Guangshao, said at a panel discussion during the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong this week that it would look for more investment opportunities in the healthcare industry. The sale of the diabetes business has also attracted interest from global private equity players, according to the people with knowledge of the process. But analysts said China could offer a tonic to J&J;’s struggling diabetes care unit and a turnaround opportunity for regional investors. Revenues at J&J;’s diabetes care unit have been falling since 2012, a Reuters study of the company’s financial results found. In the first nine months of 2017, sales slid 7.7 percent year-on-year. In 2016, it suffered a similar decline. In October, Animas Corp, the diabetes care unit that makes insulin pumps, said it would shut its business in the United States and Canada amid increased competition and after failing to find a buyer. Any sale by J&J; of its diabetes device units would fit with a drive to exit from lower-margin, commoditized categories such as glucose meters and strips, but analysts said Asian buyers may be able to squeeze more out of the assets. “Could a Chinese company extract more value from this than a multinational? It’s possible because they have different expectations of profitability than multinationals so they can be happy with lower margins,” said Franck Le Deu, Hong Kong-based senior partner at consultancy McKinsey. “One complication of being in diabetes for a Chinese company is that you need a broad portfolio to be able to compete, and a broad footprint because it’s a very dispersed market,” he added. “So the investment levels needed to be competitive in diabetes are quite high, it’s not an easy game to play.” ",1172018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-sale-exclusive/exclusive-jj-attracts-chinese-interest-for-diabetes-business-in-potential-3-4-billion-deal-sources-idUSKBN1F6190
1338,JNJ,"U.S. court invalidates J&J; cancer drug patent, hitting UK's BTG","NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. administrative court invalidated a Johnson & Johnson patent on its blockbuster prostate cancer drug Zytiga, bringing rivals closer to selling generic versions and hitting shares in its British partner BTG Plc . The Patent Trial and Appeal Board said a Johnson & Johnson patent describing a method of administering Zytiga should not have been granted because the process it described was obvious. Wednesday’s ruling was a victory for U.S. generic drug company Argentum Pharmaceuticals LLC, which had asked the board to invalidate the patent in the hope of being able to bring its own version to market. Johnson & Johnson said it strongly disagreed with the decision and might ask a federal appeals court to reverse it. Argentum did not immediately return a request for comment. The patent is due to expire in 2027. Argentum and other generic drug makers have been blocked from launching their own versions of the cancer drug until its expiration date. Zytiga generated nearly $2.3 billion in sales for Johnson & Johnson in 2016. The drug is also a money-spinner for healthcare group BTG, which earns royalties on sales of a medicine that was originally developed by cancer researchers in Britain. BTG shares fell 5 percent on Thursday on fears for this revenue stream. A BTG spokesman said its previous guidance on Zytiga royalties was unchanged and the group maintained that the earliest likely U.S. generic entry would be October 2018.

1341,JNJ,"Netflix lifts S&P;, Nasdaq; J&J;, Procter hold Dow in check","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday, as strong results from Netflix helped lift the S&P; and Nasdaq Composite, but the Dow Industrials were hemmed in by declines in Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble.      Netflix touched a record high of $257.71 and was last up 9.98 percent at $250.29, to cross the $100 billion market value threshold. The video-streaming pioneer beat Wall Street targets for new subscribers in the fourth quarter.  Other stocks known as part of the “FAANG” group - Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet - also moved higher. Insurer Travelers provided the biggest boost to the Dow, up 4.96 percent after profit topped estimates. “There has not been another time in this recovery where Main Street was doing well, where every economy in the world was doing well, and where so far there isn’t really an overwhelming show that we have a significant inflation or interest rate problem which would mandate a valuation change,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.  Paulsen cautioned, however, that as the rally continued more challenges were mounting that could cause a pullback. “If it ever does turn, there could be a fair amount of correction,” he said.  The S&P; 500 has reached a streak of 396 trading days without a 5-percent correction, according to LPL Financial, the longest on record. The benchmark index has closed within 5 percent of a record in 467 of the past 468 trading days.     S&P; 500 earnings growth for the fourth-quarter is expected at 12.4 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data through Tuesday morning. Of the 68 companies in the benchmark index that have posted results, 76.5 percent have topped Wall Street expectations.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.79 points, or 0.01 percent, to 26,210.81, the S&P; 500 gained 6.17 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,839.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 52.26 points, or 0.71 percent, to 7,460.29. Johnson & Johnson fell 4.26 percent, dragged down by a $13.6-billion charge related to the new U.S. tax law and a court ruling on a crucial patent on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade. Procter & Gamble dropped 3.09 percent as investors focused on a drop in gross margins at the world’s largest consumer goods maker. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday approved steep import tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, a move that was criticized by China, South Korea and Europe and stoked fears about potential retaliation.  In the wake of the tariffs, shares of Whirlpool rose 3.20 percent and smaller solar names such as Real Goods Solar, up 33.04 percent and Sunworks, up 10.71 percent, moved higher.      Verizon slipped 0.43 percent as its quarterly profit fell short of Wall Street estimates but revenue beat expectations as it added phone subscribers.

1344,JNJ,U.S. appeals court upholds ruling invalidating J&J; patent on Remicade,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday upheld a ruling that invalidated a crucial Johnson & Johnson patent on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, limiting J&J;’s ability to seek damages from Pfizer Inc over its launch of a lower-cost version of the drug. The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed a ruling by a U.S. administrative court that a J&J; patent covering the active ingredient in Remicade was invalid because its concepts were covered in a prior J&J; patent. Remicade generated U.S. sales of $4.8 billion for J&J; in 2016 but it faces increased competition from cheaper “biosimilar” copycats, including Pfizer’s version, which is sold in the United States under the name Inflectra. Pfizer launched Inflectra in October 2016 after winning a set of rulings that invalidated J&J;’s patent. J&J; said at the time that it considered Pfizer’s maneuver to be an “at risk” launch, meaning that Pfizer would be liable for money damages to J&J; if an appeals court reversed the rulings and upheld the patent. J&J; did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday’s ruling. Pfizer praised the ruling but said in a statement that J&J; “continues to use their scheme of exclusionary contracts to maintain Remicade’s monopoly position that prevent patients, payers and providers from the opportunity to benefit from Inflectra.”  Pfizer sued J&J; in September, saying its rival violated U.S. antitrust laws offering insurers discounts on Remicade in exchange for essentially excluding Inflectra from insurance coverage.

1345,JNJ,New York City sues drug companies over opioid epidemic,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City on Tuesday sued eight companies that make or distribute prescription opioids, blaming them for fuelling a deadly epidemic afflicting the most populous U.S. city. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the lawsuit sought $500 million of damages to help fight the crisis, which kills more people in the city annually than homicides and car accidents combined, including more than 1,100 from opioid-induced overdoses in 2016. “Big Pharma helped to fuel this epidemic by deceptively peddling these dangerous drugs and hooking millions of Americans in exchange for profit,” de Blasio said in a statement. The defendants include manufacturers Allergan Plc (AGN.N), Endo International Plc (ENDP.O), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), Purdue Pharma LP and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA), and distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N), Cardinal Health Inc (CAH.N) and McKesson Corp (MCK.N). All were accused in the city’s complaint of creating a public nuisance, and the distributors were accused of negligence. Allergan, Endo, J&J;, Purdue, Teva, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson in separate statements emphasized the importance of using opioids safely. Endo, J&J; and Purdue also denied the city’s allegations, while McKesson declined to comment on the lawsuit. Cardinal Health did not immediately respond to requests for comment. New York City, whose population is about 8.54 million, joined a long list of U.S. states and municipalities to sue drug companies over opioid abuse, which U.S. President Donald Trump has called a national public health emergency. Opioids, including prescription painkillers and heroin, played a role in 42,249 U.S. deaths in 2016, up 28 percent from 2015 and 47 percent from 2014, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In its complaint filed in state court in Manhattan, New York accused manufacturers of having for two decades misled consumers into believing that prescription opioids were safe to treat chronic non-cancer pain, with minimal risk of addiction. The city also said distributors fueled abuse through oversupply, including a failure to identify suspicious orders and report them to authorities, contributing to an illegal secondary market. Prescription opioids, such as Purdue’s OxyContin and Endo’s Percocet, are regulated as controlled substances.
