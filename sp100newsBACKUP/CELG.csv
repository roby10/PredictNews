1,CELG,Celgene second quarter profit rises; ups 2011 forecast,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) posted higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday, driven by sales of its cancer drugs Revlimid and Vidaza. It also increased its full-year forecast, sending the company’s shares up 3.7 percent to $61.66 in mid-morning trading.  Sales of Revlimid, the company’s drug to treat multiple myeloma and most important growth driver, rose 35 percent to $795 million as physicians increasingly keep patients on the drug for longer periods of time.  Data from several clinical trials suggest patients do better when treated early and when they stay on the drug as a maintenance therapy following other courses of treatment.  Revlimid is currently approved to treat patients who have failed to respond to previous therapies. Celgene is seeking approval in Europe and plans later to seek approval in the United States, to market the drug for earlier and longer use.  Investors are closely watching the actions of European regulators who are considering whether Revlimid’s benefits outweigh its risks after clinical trial data showed the drug could be linked with a higher rate of second primary malignancies. They asked Celgene to respond to a number of questions, which Celgene has done.  Robert Hugin, the company’s chief executive officer, told analysts on a conference call that Celgene is also continuing to respond to questions raised as part of its regulatory filing for an expanded package label, and has seen nothing unusual in the questions asked. While the safety review, known as Article 20, and the filing, are separate, Hugin said it is unlikely regulators would approve the label expansion until the safety review is complete.  Net profit in the quarter rose to $279 million, or 59 cents a share, from $155 million, or 33 cents a share, a year ago.  Excluding one-time items, the company earned 89 cents a share. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 86 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue rose 38 percent to $1.18 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $1.12 billion. The increase was driven by market share gains, geographic expansion and increased duration of therapy for Revlimid and Vidaza. Revenue was helped somewhat by a delay in the launch of a generic rival to Vidaza, which lost patent protection in May. So far no competition has materialized.  Sales of Vidaza rose 23 percent to $162 million, compared with an average analyst forecast of $146 million.  Celgene said it expects 2011 sales of Revlimid to rise by about 30 percent to $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion. Previously it had forecast Revlimid sales of $3.05 billion to $3.15 billion.  Sales of Abraxane, the company’s drug to treat metastatic breast cancer, were $95 million.  The company expects revenue in 2011 to rise to between $4.60 billion and $4.70 billion. Previously it forecast revenue to range between $4.45 billion and $4.55 billion.  The company forecasts 2011 earnings excluding one-time items of $3.45 to $3.55 a share. Previously the company forecast full-year earnings of between $3.35 and $3.40 a share.

3,CELG,Revlimid side effects linked to protein in study,"   * Revlimid found to interact with P-glycoprotein  * Study urges caution with Revlimid dosing  LOS ANGELES, Aug 8 (Reuters) - An early-stage trial of Celgene Corp’s (CELG.O) multiple myeloma drug Revlimid has found that it interacts with another protein that affect its dose levels in the body as well as potential side affects, according to researchers.  Revlimid, also known as lenalidomide, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2005 for treating myelodysplasia syndromes and in 2006 for multiple myeloma.  Celgene is also seeking to win approval of the drug as a maintenance therapy following a stem cell transplant.  Researchers at the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center found that lenalidomide interacts with P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a molecule that pumps potentially toxic chemicals out of cells and aids in removing them from the body.  The findings, published online in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, could lead to safer dosing of lenalidomide in a variety of diseases, the researchers said in a statement.  The team at Ohio State University conducted a Phase 1 trial of lenalidomide in combination with temsirolimus, which is sold by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) under the brand name Torisel, in 21 patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer that affects more than 20,000 Americans each year.  The study found that lenalidomide levels in patients’ blood were often higher than expected, and some patients experienced increased side effects such as electrolyte imbalances and rashes.  Laboratory experiments showed that lenalidomide was removed from cells by Pgp, and the rate of removal was reduced when temsirolimus, which is known to interact with Pgp, was included in the experiments.  “It is unusual to discover several years after FDA approval that a drug interacts with Pgp,” Dr. Mitch Phelps, assistant professor in Ohio State’s College of Pharmacy, said in a statement.  He said the delay probably occurred because the drug is predominantly excreted by the kidneys into the urine. This had been assumed to be through filtration, which is a passive process independent of Pgp or other transporter proteins.  “Although the kidneys may have the primary job of eliminating lenalidomide, our findings indicate that Pgp and other factors may also significantly contribute,” Dr. Phelps said, adding that more study is needed.

5,CELG,Wall Street ends flat as early gains evaporate,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks ended little changed on Tuesday as investors waited to see if the Federal Reserve would offer more economic stimulus and if Greece made progress in talks to avoid a default.  In the lowest volume session since late August, the market gave up earlier gains of about 1 percent as investors were wary of going home with long positions after an overnight downgrade of Italy’s credit rating.  Semiconductors were among the worst performers with the PHLX semiconductor index .SOX off 1.3 percent, dragging the Nasdaq down, after Xilinx (XLNX.O) cut its second-quarter outlook. Shares of the chipmaker fell 4.5 percent to $30.03.  Helping temper some European debt worries, Greece promised further cuts to its public sector before a second conference call with international lenders, whom Athens must persuade to extend more loans to avoid bankruptcy next month.  At the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, the Fed is expected to announce plans to intervene in the bond market to push long-term interest rates — already near historic lows — even lower in a move known as Operation Twist.  “They are focusing on the fact that a lot of people are expecting more out of the Fed than they are going to get — they are going to get the twist, they are not going to get a QE3,” said Ken Polcari, managing director at ICAP Equities in New York.  “They are looking for certainty, not guesswork because it’s the uncertainty that causes the markets to become erratic. If the markets are clear on where they are going, then they start to trade back on fundamentals, but if it’s unclear, then it just trades on the headline news because it becomes erratic.”  Defensive sectors such as utilities, telecommunications and health care were the biggest advancers, indicating some investor nervousness.

8,CELG,Celgene shares jump ahead of EU drug safety review,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Shares of Celgene Corp (CELG.O) jumped more than 7 percent to a 12-month high on Tuesday amid speculation that European regulators will conclude that the benefits of the company’s cancer drug Revlimid outweigh its risks.  European regulators initiated a safety review, known as Article 20, after concerns arose that the drug might increase the risk of developing second primary malignancies.  An advisory panel to the European Commission is meeting this week and an Article 20 decision is expected, possibly early Friday.  Revlimid is Celgene’s most important growth driver. It is approved in the United States and Europe, in combination with dexamethasone, to treat patients with multiple myeloma who have failed at least one previous therapy.  The company has also applied for approval in Europe to market the drug as a first-line treatment, and as a maintenance therapy. Celgene expects to apply for the same additional indications in the United States early next year.  “We expect favorable resolution of the Article 20 review near term, removing an overhang and perhaps signaling (European) receptivity toward front-line/maintenance label expansion early next year,” Wells Fargo analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note.

Investors took comfort from news in the previous session that Greece was close to a new deal with the troika of international lenders — the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.   Market players warned that the rally could be short-lived as investors typically “buy the rumor and sell the fact,” and may be tempted to take profits on Wednesday after a strong performance all last week.

The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC rose 18.28 points, or 0.70 percent, to 2,631.11.   Technical indicators, however, pointed to a positive “risk on” tone over the next week.

Meisels is looking for the year to end on stronger ground, but for that to happen, he said the S&P 500 needs to hold above 1,125 to avoid the risk of a sell-off close to 1,000.

The positive ruling was expected. On Tuesday Celgene’s shares rose to a 12-month high of $65.86. They slipped 0.3 percent on Friday in early trading on Nasdaq.   European regulators initiated a safety review, known as Article 20, following concerns the drug might increase the risk of new cancers, or second primary malignancies.   The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said the benefit-risk balance for Revlimid remained positive within its approved patient population. It is approved in the U.S. and Europe in combination with dexamethasone in patients who have failed at least one prior therapy.   Celgene is seeking approval to market the drug in Europe in newly diagnosed patients and as a maintenance therapy.   The EMA concluded that newly diagnosed patients taking Revlimid showed a fourfold increase in the number of new cancers, including solid tumors and cancers of the blood and immune system and recommended this information be included in the drug’s prescribing information.   “Although the studies were carried out in patients for whom Revlimid is not currently indicated, the Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) was concerned that the results could also be relevant for the approved patient population,” the EMA said in a statement.   The agency noted an increased risk of new cancers in the current approved population but concluded that the benefits of Revlimid, particularly improved survival, continue to outweigh the risks.   Revlimid is the main driver of Celgene’s growth. The company expects 2011 sales of the drug to rise about 30 percent to some $3.2 billion.   Investor attention will now focus on Europe’s decision, expected in the first half of next year, whether to approve the drug for newly diagnosed patients.   “We feel increasingly confident in EU front line approval and since this concern has been the most significant overhang on the stock essentially all year, we think its full resolution  - which will only come with EU front-line approval - should allow for shares to work into the $70 area,” said Christopher Raymond, an analyst at Robert W. Baird, in a research note.   Some analysts are more cautious.   The EMA made clear that its positive opinion refers at this stage only to relapsed patients for whom the drug is already approved. Data has shown the drug’s proven ability in this population to extend survival. So far, only one of three trials in newly diagnosed patients - a trial known as CALGB - has shown an overall survival benefit.   CALGB tested patients who had previously undergone a stem cell transplant. The two other trials, known as IFM and MM-015, tested patients who were not eligible for a transplant. These two trials have not so far shown an overall survival benefit, though they have shown the drug extends the length of time before the disease progresses.   Brian Abrahams, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said the EMA’s insistence that its ruling only apply to relapsed patients “perhaps raises the question of whether the survival benefits observed in the CALGB study will be sufficient for label expansion.”   It is important for Celgene to win a label expansion in Europe, where doctors, unlike those in the United States, are not allowed to prescribe medicines for patient populations for which they have not been approved. In the United States, many physicians already prescribe Revlimid to newly diagnosed patients on an “off-label” basis. Celgene expects to file for approval to market the drug for newly diagnosed patients in the United States early next year.   Greg Geissman, a spokesman for Celgene, said data from the IFM and MM-015 trials continue to mature and they could over time show a survival benefit.   Importantly, the EMA did not indicate that there is an association between the duration of Revlimid therapy and the risk of new cancers.   “This is potentially positive since it indicates that, if approved in newly diagnosed patients, the EMA is unlikely to place a duration cap on Revlimid use,” said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at ISI Group, in a research note.

12,CELG,Celgene pays $20 mln to extend Agios agreement," * Celgene extends cancer drug exclusivity deal with Agios   * Agrees to pay $20 mln for one-year extension   * Agreement covers cancer metabolism drugs   By Toni Clarke   Oct 5 (Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) has agreed to pay $20 million to extend an exclusive partnership with private drugmaker Agios Pharmaceuticals to develop a novel class of cancer drugs.   Celgene, a leading maker of drugs to treat blood cancers, has been expanding into solid tumors. Agios, which was formed in 2008, is developing drugs that interfere with the ability of cancer cells to feed themselves.   The agreement extends by one year the terms of a three-year exclusivity deal signed by the two companies in April 2010. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Agios said Celgene has the ability to extend the exclusive collaboration further in future.   Agios is working on a new approach to treating cancer — targeting altered metabolic enzymes that feed cancer cells.   “We know that cancers need two to four hundred times more nutrients than normal cells,” David Schenkein, Agios’s chief executive officer, said in an interview. “They need to build biomass quickly so they’ve rewired their enzymes to feed their needs.”    Schenkein was formerly senior vice president of clinical hematology/oncology at Genentech, a leading cancer drug maker that is now a unit of Roche Holding AG ROG.VX.   “We see cancer metabolism as an exciting new field of development,” Schenkein said. “Where we’ve demonstrated the most progress is identifying targets, validating them and creating small molecules to hit those targets.”   Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene decided to extend the exclusivity period because it has been impressed by the first 18 months of the collaboration, said Dr. Thomas Daniel, Celgene’s president of research.   Under the terms of the original agreement, Agios received a $130 million upfront payment, including an equity investment. Celgene has an exclusive option to license any promising drug candidates at the end of clinical testing in a Phase I trial.   Daniel said Celgene is interested, among other targets, in the IDH1 enzyme, shown to play a role in cancer formation, through altered metabolic activity.   “IDH1 is an enzyme that’s important in metabolizing glucose, and mutant forms generate an unusual metabolic side product which accumulates in very high levels in cancer patients,” said Daniel.   As the field has evolved, Daniel said there is evidence of the importance of the IDH1 target beyond acute myelogenous leukemia, where it was discovered, but is also important in solid tumors.   Celgene decided to extend the exclusivity period nearly two years before the preset deadline, which Schenkein said was in mid-2013.

13,CELG,UPDATE 2-Celgene asked to specify Revlimid cancer risk," * Europeans ask Celgene to specify Revlimid SPM risk   * Say company must update previous press release   * Provides language to include in updated label   * Celgene shares drop 2 percent in early trading  (Updates with malignancy data details, updates shares)   By Toni Clarke   Oct 6 (Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) said on Thursday it has been asked by European regulators to be more specific in describing the risk of new cancers forming in patients taking its blood cancer drug Revlimid.   European regulators recently completed a safety review of Revlimid, which was initiated following concerns the drug might increase the risk of new cancers, known as second primary malignancies (SPMs).   On Sept. 23, Celgene issued a press release announcing the completion of the review, in which the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said the benefit-risk balance for Revlimid remained positive within its approved patient population.   Revlimid, Celgene’s most important growth driver, is approved in the United States and Europe in combination with dexamethasone to treat multiple myeloma in patients who have failed at least one prior therapy.   Celgene said in its September announcement that the European analysis concluded that the “incidence rate of invasive SPMs (hematological malignancies and solid tumors) observed in the pivotal studies was low, and within the expected background rate for this patient population.”   Brian Gill, a spokesman for Celgene, said in an interview that the EMA told the company it was being “too general” when it used the phrase “low incidence” and that it wanted Celgene to be more specific. It also provided detailed information Celgene must include in its expanded product label.   In addition, because the European agency’s press release did not discuss a link between the duration of Revlimid use and the development of SPMs, Celgene removed language from its previous press release in which it said that there was no link between duration and SPM risk.   Among the details Celgene must spell out are the number and type of new malignancies seen in clinical trials.   In clinical trials of previously treated patients there were 3.98 SPMs per 100 patient years in the Revlimid group compared with 1.38 per 100 patient years in the control group.   In newly diagnosed patients there was a four-fold increase in the incidence of SPMs — 7 percent for the Revlimid group versus 1.8 percent for the control group.   The new prescribing information will note that “the risk of occurrence of SPM must be taken into account before initiating treatment with Revlimid.”   On completion of its review, the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) indicated that while the studies were carried out in patients for whom Revlimid is not currently indicated — namely, newly-diagnosed patients — the CHMP was concerned that they could also be relevant for the approved population.   The agency concluded that in the current approved population the benefits of Revlimid, particularly improved survival, continue to outweigh the risks.   Celgene’s shares fell 2 percent to $62.77 in early trading on Nasdaq.

14,CELG,UPDATE 1-Celgene's Revlimid fails to help prostate cancer,"* Monitoring committee finds no survival benefit * Shares flat after initial fall Nov 22 (Reuters) - Celgene Corp said on Tuesday it will stop a late-stage trial of Revlimid for prostate cancer after it was determined that it would not extend survival, eliminating a potential avenue of expanded use for its flagship drug. The U.S. biotech company said an independent monitoring committee recommended that the pivotal Phase III Mainsail trial be halted after it determined that adding Revlimid to standard treatments would not significantly increase overall survival of patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. “We have accepted this recommendation of the (monitoring committee) and following formal notification and review of the analysis, physicians and patients, internationally, will be officially advised of this action,” Celgene said in a statement. The study was testing Revlimid, known chemically as lenalidomide, in combination with the chemotherapy drug docetaxel and the steroid prednisone against those two drugs alone. Revlimid is approved for the treatment of the blood cancer multiple myeloma and for anemia associated with myelodysplastic syndromes. The drug had sales of $820 million in the third quarter. Independent safety monitoring committees are used to oversee blinded clinical trials in which researchers and patients are unaware of who is receiving study drugs or placebos. These committees can halt a trial if it determines that a drug is unsafe or not likely to work. It may also stop a trial if a drug is working so well that it would be unethical not to offer it to patients in the control group.

15,CELG,Celgene 2012 outlook tops expectations,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) said on Monday it expects 2012 earnings to be higher than expected, sending its shares up as much as 2.4 percent. Celgene presented unaudited fourth-quarter results at the J.P. Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco, where it also said U.S. regulators will review its experimental multiple myeloma drug pomalidomide on an accelerated basis. Typically the Food and Drug Administration requires data from a late-stage Phase III trial before it will agree to review an application, but Celgene said it expects to file based on Phase II data by the end of the first quarter. “This had been expected by many, but not all Street observers for some time,” said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at ISI Group. “Nonetheless it’s a modest upside surprise in our view.” The Summit, New Jersey-based biotech company said it expects earnings excluding items in 2012 to rise about 25 percent to between $4.70 and $4.80 a share. It expects revenue to rise about 15 percent to between $5.4 billion and $5.6 billion. Analysts expect earnings in 2012 of $4.52 a share and revenue of $5.39 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company expects sales of Revlimid, the company’s treatment for multiple myeloma and most important product, to increase about 19 percent to a range of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion. The company expects growth of Revlimid to be driven by continued geographic expansion and reimbursement from countries such as Russia, Korea and Brazil. It also hopes to win approval this year to market Revlimid in newly diagnosed patients in Europe. Revlimid is approved in the United States and Europe in combination with dexamethasone to treat multiple myeloma in patients who have failed at least one prior therapy. Celgene is seeking to market the drug in newly diagnosed patients and as a maintenance therapy. A decision by the European Medicines Agency is expected in the first half of this year. The company expects to file for approval to market the drug in newly diagnosed patients in the United States early this year. In the United States many physicians already prescribe Revlimid to this patient population on an “off-label” basis. The strong 2012 outlook offset somewhat lower-than-expected preliminary fourth-quarter results. The company posted net fourth-quarter earnings of 93 cents a share, up from 45 cents a share a year ago. Revenue rose 22 percent to $1.28 billion. Earnings excluding one-time items were $1.05 a share. Analysts had on average expected earnings excluding items of $1.08 a share. Fourth-quarter sales of Revlimid rose about 20 percent to about $855 million. Celgene said it is on track to exceed 2015 targets of $8 billion in revenue and $8 a share in earnings, excluding one-time items. Fourth-quarter sales of Vidaza, the company’s drug to treat a group of blood disorders known as myelodysplastic syndromes, rose about 34 percent to $189 million. Vidaza has lost patent protection in the United States. It retains exclusivity in Europe through the end of 2018 and in Japan until 2021. Sales of the company’s breast cancer drug Abraxane, which Celgene got with its acquisition of Abraxis BioSciences in 2010, were $104 million. Celgene’s shares rose 1.8 percent to $68.43 in mid-afternoon trading on Nasdaq. Earlier in the day they rose as high as $68.85.

17,CELG,Celgene profit jumps; to buy Avila,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp said (CELG.O) fourth-quarter earnings nearly doubled on higher sales of its multiple myeloma drug Revlimid, and it disclosed plans to acquire smaller biotechnology company Avila Therapeutics for $350 million. Celgene, which reported preliminary results earlier this month, said earnings rose to $410 million, or 91 cents a share, from $209.6 million, or 44 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue climbed to $1.28 billion from $1.07 billion. As previously reported, earnings excluding one-time items were $1.05 a share. Celgene is seeking to further expand its presence in the market for blood cancer medicines. Avila, a privately held company based near Boston, is developing a blood cancer drug known as AVL-292 which is in early-stage development. Avila’s technology is designed to disable certain proteins associated with disease. Celgene said the technology will help it develop new treatments for managing other complex disorders. “We see Avila’s unique approach to protein silencing as an area of great promise for our research initiatives in hematology, oncology and immune-inflammatory diseases,” Tom Daniel, Celgene’s president of research and early development, said in a statement. Geoff Porges, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said in a research note that the acquisition is consistent with Celgene’s prior practice of investing in emerging companies and technologies. “Avila’s drug is currently in Phase I development for B cell hematological malignancies and could fit nicely with Celgene’s existing portfolio of drugs for myeloma as well as their hoped-for activity in lymphoma and leukemia,” he said. Fourth-quarter sales of Revlimid rose 20 percent to $855 million, driven by gains in market share, increased duration of therapy, and geographic expansion. Revlimid sales rose 21 percent in the United States and 20 percent internationally. Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene said it expects a decision by European regulators in the 2012 first half on whether to approve Revlimid for use in newly diagnosed patients and as a maintenance therapy. The drug is currently approved as a treatment for patients who have failed other therapies. The decision is important because unlike the United States, where the drug can and is used “off label” in newly diagnosed patients, European physicians are not allowed to prescribe the drug for any unapproved use. Sales of the Vidaza, Celgene’s treatment for a group of blood disorders known as myelodysplastic syndromes, rose 34 percent to $189 million in the fourth quarter. U.S. sales rose 19 percent while international sales rose 51 percent, driven by recent launches in new markets, including the UK and Japan. Celgene Chief Financial Officer Jacqualyn Fouse told analysts on a conference call that the company expects sales of Vidaza to be flat going into 2012 as the drug has now lost market exclusivity in the United Sates. It retains exclusivity in Europe through the end of 2018 and in Japan until 2021. The company said it expects to submit a marketing application for its drug pomalidomide to be used by relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients in the United States during the first quarter of 2012, and with European regulators in the first half of 2012. Celgene said the impact of currency movements was relatively small in the fourth quarter due to its hedging strategy. Pressure on prices in Europe was offset by higher prices elsewhere. The company stood by its earnings and revenue forecasts for 2012. It expects earnings, excluding one-time items, to rise about 25 percent to a range of $4.70 to $4.80 per share. It expects revenue to rise about 15 percent to between $5.4 billion and $5.6 billion. It expects sales of Revlimid to rise about 19 percent to between $3.75 billion and $3.85 billion.

19,CELG,Celgene approves buyback of up to $2.5 billion in stock,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) said on Wednesday it authorized the additional repurchase of up to $2.5 billion in common stock, effective immediately. In April, the biotechnology company said it repurchased about 2.35 million shares during the first quarter of 2012 for about $169 million. As of March 31, it had $1.218 billion remaining under its existing stock repurchase program. The company’s shares rose 2.3 percent to $64.51 in morning trading on Nasdaq. “Celgene has kept a recent practice of opportunistically repurchasing shares when they appear depressed,” said Brian Abrahams, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, in a research note. Celgene’s shares have fallen roughly 20 percent from their year high of $80.42 in April. The company posted disappointing first-quarter earnings results as sales of Revlimid, its drug for multiple myeloma and most important growth driver, missed expectations. Revlimid is approved as a treatment for patients who have failed other therapies, and is often used in the United States in newly diagnosed patients. European physicians are not allowed to prescribe drugs “off label” for unapproved uses. Celgene has filed for European approval to market the drug for newly diagnosed patients. A decision is expected within weeks. “This could potentially signal some confidence going into the upcoming Revlimid decision on label expansion in Europe, though it will be informative to see when management implements the buybacks,” Abrahams said. Greg Geissman, a spokesman for Celgene, said the decision to increase share repurchases took place at a company board meeting as part of the normal course of business.

20,CELG,Exclusive: Celgene mulls Human Genome Sciences bid - source,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) is one of two companies discussing whether to bid for Human Genome Sciences Inc HGSI.O, which seeks an alternative to a hostile offer by British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L), a source familiar with the situation said. Conventional wisdom among investors has been that Human Genome was unlikely to find another bidder, as Glaxo reaps 50 percent of the profit from the lupus drug Benlysta, to which Glaxo and Human Genome share the rights. Human Genome has so far refused Glaxo’s $13 per share, or $2.6 billion offer as too low and Wall Street analysts (surveyed by Reuters in May) had predicted that bid would need to be raised to about $15 per share to succeed. According to a source familiar with the situation, two companies are in discussions with Human Genome, aside from Glaxo, with Celgene probably in the pole position should it decide to bid. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak to the media, did not identify the second bidder but said it would most likely be a merger-of-equals scenario. The deadline for bids is July 16. A Celgene spokesman declined to comment on the company’s acquisition-related activity. Representatives for Human Genome were not immediately available for comment. Celgene, based in Summit, New Jersey, is one of the world’s biggest biotechnology companies and makes the blood cancer drugs Revlimid and Vidaza. It is also developing a pipeline of drugs to treat autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, a disease in which the immune system attacks the patient’s own body. Last year Human Genome and Glaxo won approval for Benlysta, the first new treatment for lupus in 50 years. But the drug’s launch proved disappointing and Human Genome’s shares fell from a high above $25 to a low of $6.51 in December. Glaxo made its offer a few months later, prompting Human Genome to launch an auction with the help of Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs. Glaxo, in turn, is considering whether to seek to replace the entire board of Human Genome, and has lined up candidates who have agreed to be nominees, once the outcome of the auction process is known, a separate source familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier this week. The takeover battle marks a turning point in the long-standing partnership between the two drugmakers. Glaxo and Human Genome are also developing a heart disease drug, darapladib, that, if successful, could generate more than $1 billion in sales. Celgene has long been one of biotechnology’s most reliable growth stocks, with a market value of nearly $29 billion, largely built on the success of its multiple myeloma treatments Thalomid and Revlimid. While there is no certainty Celgene will make a bid for Human Genome, Benlysta would appear to fit into its wheelhouse. Celgene has two drugs in mid-stage trials for two types of lupus that mainly affect the skin. About 10 percent of people with cutaneous lupus later develop systemic lupus, for which Benlysta is approved. Currently, cutaneous lupus is treated with a variety of ointments and, increasingly, with Celgene’s own drug Thalomid.

Celgene has long been one of biotechnology’s most reliable growth stocks, with a market value of nearly $29 billion, largely built on the success of its multiple myeloma treatments Thalomid and Revlimid. While there is no certainty Celgene will make a bid for Human Genome, Benlysta would appear to fit into its wheelhouse. Celgene has two drugs in mid-stage trials for two types of lupus that mainly affect the skin. About 10 percent of people with cutaneous lupus later develop systemic lupus, for which Benlysta is approved. Currently, cutaneous lupus is treated with a variety of ointments and, increasingly, with Celgene’s own drug Thalomid.

22,CELG,Celgene psoriatic arthritis drug effective in trial,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp said on Thursday its experimental treatment for psoriatic arthritis was effective in a late-stage clinical trial, with no significant safety issues. The company said it expects to file for marketing approval of the drug, apremilast, in the first half of next year. Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, inflammatory disease that affects the joints and causes pain, stiffness and swelling. It is associated with the skin disorder, psoriasis. The study, known as PALACE-1, is the first of three late-stage trials of the drug, a pill which inhibits an enzyme known as phosphodiesterase 4, or PDE4, and acts to damp down inflammation. Celgene said a statistically significant proportion of patients in the 495-patient trial achieved a 20 percent improvement in symptoms at 24 weeks, as measured by a score determined by the American College of Rheumatology. The company did not give the exact number of patients who achieved the benefit. The company tested the drug at 20 mg and 30 mg. It said a significant proportion of patients taking the 20 mg and 30 mg doses achieved an improvement of 50 percent. A proportion of those taking the 30 mg dose even achieved a 70 percent improvement. Analysts reacted with cautious optimism to the news. “Although we need more detailed data to fully assess apremilast’s overall profile in psoriatic arthritis, we feel this is much needed good news for Celgene,” said Brian Abrahams, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, in a research note. Still, Celgene’s shares fell 1.4 percent to $62.43 in midday trading on Nasdaq. The company said that a pilot study of apremilast as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, when given in combination with the treatment methotrexate, did not achieve its main goal. Data from a second study testing the drug without methotrexate are expected in the third quarter of this year. Celgene said it is examining whether the methotrexate dampened the impact of apremilast in the combination study and said it plans to continue development of the drug in rheumatoid arthritis. The company is also testing apremilast in psoriasis and expects to start reporting data from two late-stage studies by the end of this year, and to file for marketing approval in the second half of next year. In Europe, the company plans to file for both the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis indications together in the second half of the year. Side effects were consistent with those seen in earlier trials, with gastrointestinal disturbances and upper respiratory tract infections the most common. However, they were not more prevalent in the treatment group than the placebo group. “Overall, we view today’s news as an incremental positive,” said Geoff Meacham, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, in a research note. “However, more detailed efficacy and safety data are needed before the Street ascribes meaningful value to the apremilast program.” ",7122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-celgene-drug/celgene-psoriatic-arthritis-drug-effective-in-trial-idUSBRE86B0P120120712
23,CELG,UPDATE 2-Celgene psoriatic arthritis drug effective in trial,"* Apremilast effective in first of three late trials * Celgene aims to file for approval next year * No significant safety issues reported By Toni Clarke July 12 (Reuters) - Celgene Corp said on Thursday its experimental treatment for psoriatic arthritis was effective in a late-stage clinical trial, with no significant safety issues.

24,CELG,Celgene to appeal negative European opinion on Istodax,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp said on Friday it plans to ask a European advisory panel to reconsider its decision not to recommend approval of the company’s treatment for relapsed or refractory peripheral t-cell lymphoma (PTCL). The news sent Celgene’s shares down as much as 2 percent. Celgene submitted an application for approval of the drug, Istodax, based on an open-label mid-stage study, meaning there was no comparator arm in the trial. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug based on the same trial data last year but advisors to the European Medicines Agency recommended against approval, saying the lack of a comparator arm made it difficult to assess the drug’s relative benefits and risks. Celgene said regulators acknowledged that the drug, also known as romidepsin, demonstrated anti-tumor activity, and the company said it remains convinced that the drug represents an important new therapy for a disease in which patients have very few options. The rebuff from the Europeans is the second in a month for Celgene. In June the company withdrew an application to market its blood cancer drug Revlimid for a broader patient population after European regulators asked for more information proving the drug’s benefits outweighed its risk. Istodax generated sales of $30 million in 2011, a tiny percentage of Celgene’s $4.8 billion in revenue for the year. Celgene said it plans to open a bigger, Phase III trial in PTCL for previously untreated patients this year. The company gained Istodax with its acquisition in late 2009 of Gloucester Pharmaceuticals. Celgene shares were down 2.1 percent to $66.57 in late morning trading on Nasdaq. Earlier in the day they fell as low as $66.52. ",7202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-celgene-appeal/celgene-to-appeal-negative-european-opinion-on-istodax-idUSBRE86J0X620120720
25,CELG,EU agency backs Takeda and J&J; drugs; snubs Celgene,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Medicines Agency said on Friday an expert committee had recommended approval of new blood cancer drugs from Takeda and Johnson & Johnson, but not one from Celgene. Europe’s drugs watchdog gave a green light to Takeda’s Adcetris treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma and systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, alongside Johnson & Johnson’s Dacogen medicine for acute myeloid leukaemia. Celgene, however, got a negative recommendation for Istodax, its treatment for peripheral T-cell lymphoma. The U.S. biotech said it would request a re-examination. The regulator also backed wider use of Abbott Laboratories’ top-selling Humira — expected to be the world’s biggest-selling medicine in 2012 — for moderate Crohn’s disease. Recommendations for drug approvals by the EMA are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months. As previously reported, the agency’s expert committee also recommended the first gene therapy drug and a new lung cancer pill from Pfizer at its regular monthly meeting.

26,CELG,Celgene profit up 32 percent; sales of cancer drugs strong,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) said on Thursday its second-quarter earnings rose 32 percent, topping expectations, helped by increased sales of its cancer drugs. The company raised its profit forecast for the year but kept its revenue outlook unchanged. Celgene’s shares rose 4.5 percent in early trading. Net earnings rose to $367 million, or 82 cents a share, from $279 million, or 59 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Celgene earned $1.22 a share. Analysts on average expected $1.18, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 16 percent to $1.37 billion. Analysts were expecting $1.35 billion. Global net sales of Revlimid, the company’s drug to treat multiple myeloma and its most important growth driver, rose 17 percent to $934 million, topping analysts’ expectations by $14 million. The gains in Revlimid sales were driven by increased duration of therapy and expanded sales outside the United States. Brian Abrahams, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said the Revlimid figures were “much needed” and “should help reignite some enthusiasm for the company’s long-term growth prospects.” Revlimid has suffered some setbacks recently. Last month Celgene was forced to withdraw an application to sell Revlimid for a wider patient population in Europe after regulators asked for more information proving that the drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. On a conference call with investors, Robert Hugin, Celgene’s chief executive, said that while the company was disappointed with the ruling, it plans to resubmit the drug as a first-line treatment and maintenance therapy “as soon as the maturity of the data allows.” Revlimid is currently approved for patients who have failed at least one prior therapy. The company hopes to win approval to market the drug for patients at earlier stages of their disease and for longer periods of time. Hugin said the timing and scope of the front-line filing for Revlimid in the United States was under review. Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at ISI Group, called the quarterly results “very good” but said that ultimately investors are focused on new uses for Revlimid and the potential approval of new drugs. Second-quarter sales of Celgene’s breast cancer drug Abraxane rose 16 percent to $110 million, while sales of Vidaza, its drug to treat a group of blood disorders known as myelodysplastic syndromes, rose 24 percent to $201 million. Later this year the company expects to announce data from a trial of its experimental drug pomalidomide in multiple myeloma patients who have relapsed or failed other treatments. Celgene is also expecting results from a trial of the drug in myelofibrosis, a disorder of the bone marrow. Hugin said he expects pomalidomide to be Celgene’s next “blockbuster,” meaning a drug that generates sales of more than $1 billion. The company is also expecting late-stage data from trials of Abraxane in melanoma and metastatic pancreatic cancer, and expects a decision from U.S. regulators as to whether they will approve Abraxane in non-small cell lung cancer. Late-stage data is also expected from the second of three trials of its experimental drug apremilast in psoriatic arthritis. Results from the first trial, released earlier this month, showed the drug was effective with no significant safety issues. The company is also expecting late-stage data from apremilast against psoriasis, a skin disorder, late this year or early in 2013. The company raised its 2012 profit forecast; it now expects earnings, excluding one-time items, of $4.80 to $4.85 a share, up from a previous forecast of $4.70 to $4.80. It expects revenue to rise 15 percent to a range of $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion. It expects sales of Revlimid in 2012 to rise 19 percent to a range of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion.

30,CELG,FDA approves Celgene's Abraxane for lung cancer,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Friday widened the approved use of Celgene Corp’s breast cancer drug Abraxane to include treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer. Abraxane is currently approved to treat patients with metastatic breast cancer who have failed to respond to other treatments. Celgene hopes to win approval to market it for several other types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer and melanoma. Celgene, whose shares rose as much as 2.6 percent Friday morning, acquired Abraxane when it bought Abraxis BioScience in 2010 for $2.9 billion, which some investors considered an excessively high price. The drug combines the cancer chemotherapy paclitaxel with a protein called albumin, which Celgene believes helps deliver a greater amount of chemotherapy to cancer cells with fewer side effects. A late-stage trial of Abraxane showed that tumors shrank in 33 percent of patients taking the drug along with standard chemotherapy treatment carboplatin compared with 25 percent of patients who took paclitaxel plus carboplatin. Abraxane’s peak annual lung cancer sales could eventually reach $110 million, according to a research note from Barclays on Thursday. The company also said that it had filed for regulatory approval in Japan, Australia and New Zealand and expected decisions in 2013. Celgene shares were up $1.88 at $79.60 in morning Nasdaq trading while the Nasdaq Biotech Index was little changed.

31,CELG,Monitor says Celgene cancer drug meets late-stage goals,"(Reuters) - An independent safety panel determined that Celgene Corp’s experimental cancer drug had met the main goal of a late-stage trial by improving progression-free survival in multiple myeloma patients who have relapsed or not responded to prior treatment, the drugmaker said. The study’s data safety monitoring board also determined that the pomalidomide drug, given in combination with a low dose of existing treatment dexamethasone, was superior to a high dose of the existing treatment in improving overall survival. Following an interim analysis, the safety monitoring board recommended that patients who had not yet progressed in the Phase III trial’s high-dose dexamethasone control arm should start on Celgene’s combination. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said Celgene had already applied for U.S. and European marketing approvals of pomalidomide based on favorable data from two Phase II, or mid-stage, trials. The larger Phase III trial was a “confirmatory” study designed for U.S. regulators, to back up data seen in the earlier mid-stage studies, Schoenebaum said in a research note. “So this trial, according to the company, should ‘de-risk’ the European Union application,” Schoenebaum said. He added that a decision from European regulators on the drug is expected in mid or late 2013. U.S. regulators are expected to decide on marketing approval in February. Celgene’s flagship $3.5 billion-a-year Revlimid drug also treats multiple myeloma and is approved for patients who have failed at least one prior therapy. The company hopes to eventually win approval to market Revlimid at earlier stages of the disease and for longer periods. Both Revlimid and pomalidomide are derivatives of the chemical thalidomide and work in part by choking off growth of blood vessels that feed tumors. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells - a type of white blood cell responsible for producing antibodies - that affects the bone marrow. The cancer eventually interferes with production of normal blood cells. The National Cancer Institute estimates that 21,700 men and women in the United States will be diagnosed with myeloma in 2012. In July, Celgene Chief Executive Officer Robert Hugin said he expected pomalidomide to generate sales of more than $1 billion annually in a multiple myeloma treatment market that analysts have forecast at $5.4 billion by 2016. Celgene is one of the world’s largest biotech companies, with annual sales of more than $5 billion, largely because of Revlimid’s success. The company also sells Abraxane, a breast cancer treatment with annual sales of about $400 million, and Vidaza, which treats a group of blood disorders known as myelodysplastic syndromes and has annual sales of $800 million. Shares of Celgene were down 0.8 percent at $74.40 in afternoon Nasdaq trading, while the NYSARC Biotech Index fell 2.2 percent amid sharp declines for the broad stock market.

32,CELG,Celgene profit beats forecasts as Revlimid delivers,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp’s (CELG.O) quarterly earnings rose 14 percent, beating expectations on strong sales of its Revlimid cancer treatment and lower costs, but investors were more focused on ongoing studies of its promising new medicines and wider uses for Revlimid. The higher-than-expected profit was due in part to lower costs of goods and a smaller number of outstanding company shares, analysts said. “Overall, we are pleased to see the company continuing to deliver operating leverage and bottom-line beats with increases in earnings guidance,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note. The company, which narrowly raised its full-year earnings view, said on Thursday it earned $424 million, or 97 cents per share, in the third quarter. That compared with $373 million, or 81 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, Celgene earned $1.29 per share, exceeding analysts’ average expectations by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company now sees 2012 adjusted earnings of $4.85 to $4.90 per share, up from its prior view of $4.80 to $4.85. However, it slightly lowered the top end of its revenue forecast range to $5.55 billion from $5.60 billion. In a conference call with analysts, Celgene said its roster of experimental drugs has the potential to drive future growth. They include pomalidomide, for multiple myeloma patients who have relapsed or failed to respond to other treatments, and apremilast for psoriasis and arthritis associated with the skin condition. “Apremilast has the potential to transform Celgene,” Chief Executive Bob Hugin said. Mara Goldstein, an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald, said she believes Wall Street is underestimating the potential of the company’s experimental drugs to propel earnings growth as Revlimid matures and posts weaker sales gains. “That’s the most bullish I’ve heard the company on apremilast,” Goldstein said. The company said it aims to seek U.S. marketing approval for the drug in the first quarter of 2013 for psoriatic arthritis, and in the second half of that year for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. Company revenue in the third quarter rose 14 percent to $1.42 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $1.41 billion. Sales of Revlimid, Celgene’s biggest product and profit driver, jumped 18 percent to $970 million, in line with Wall Street forecasts. The growth was fueled by earlier and longer patient use of the drug for multiple myeloma, and introduction of the medicine in new regions. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells - a type of white blood cell responsible for producing antibodies - that affects the bone marrow. The cancer eventually interferes with production of normal blood cells. The National Cancer Institute estimated that 21,700 people in the United States will be diagnosed with myeloma in 2012. Sales of Abraxane, a treatment for metastatic breast cancer, fell 6 percent to $106 million. Celgene said the decline was partly due to a surge in U.S. demand for the drug in 2011 as a result of shortages of standard chemotherapy agent paclitaxel. Celgene, which had been criticized for paying $2.9 billion in 2010 for Abraxis Bioscience in order to obtain Abraxane, is hoping to broaden its use and is testing the drug in other types of cancer, such as melanoma and pancreatic cancer. U.S. regulators recently approved use of Abraxane as a first-line treatment of the most common form of lung cancer. The drug significantly delayed disease progression in advanced melanoma patients in a late stage clinical trial and was showing a trend toward improving overall survival, according to preliminary data released by the company. Goldstein said she expected peak annual Abraxane sales of about $750 million to $800 million with its currently approved uses, and possibly well over $1 billion if it proves effective against other cancers. Sales of Vidaza, used to treat a group of blood disorders known as myelodysplastic syndromes, rose 15 percent to $220 million. Sales of Thalomid, the company’s older treatment for multiple myeloma, fell 10 percent to $75 million. The company boosted its 2012 earnings forecast, excluding special items, to between $4.85 and $4.90 per share, from a previous view of $4.80 to $4.85. Celgene said it expects full-year Revlimid sales to rise about 18 percent to between $3.75 and $3.8 billion. It previously forecast $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion.

38,CELG,Celgene stock soars on promising pancreatic cancer drug data,"(Reuters) - Shares of Celgene Corp (CELG.O) rose as much as 9.7 percent on Monday after a late-stage clinical trial showed its drug Abraxane improved survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. Celgene, which unexpectedly reported the results late on Friday, did not give details of the extent of the improvement, saying it would do so at a medical meeting in January. Abraxane is already approved to treat breast and lung cancer and the company will apply for approval from regulators to market the drug to treat pancreatic cancer as well. Analysts sought to tease out the magnitude of the benefit using data from previous trials of Abraxane and historical results achieved by the chemotherapy used in the trial, gemcitabine. “We believe Abraxane would very likely have provided at least a 2 month - if not greater - median overall survival benefit versus gemcitabine alone - clinically meaningful, in our view,” said Brian Abrahams, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities LLC, in a research report. Celgene acquired Abraxane when it bought Abraxis BioScience in 2010 for $2.9 billion. The drug combines the cancer chemotherapy paclitaxel with a protein called albumin which Celgene believes helps deliver a greater amount of chemotherapy to cancer cells with fewer side effects. Some analysts had viewed the price paid by Celgene for Abraxis as excessively high; but subsequent positive results of the drug in lung cancer, melanoma, and now pancreatic cancer, suggest the price may have been justified. In October the company released results of a late-stage clinical trial showing patients with melanoma lived for a longer period without getting worse than those who received the chemotherapy dacarbazine. Analysts say the drug will probably need to show that it also improves overall survival in patients with melanoma if it is to be competitive with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY.N) Yervoy and Roche Holding AG’s ROG.VX Zelboraf. Celgene has said it expects sales of Abraxane, assuming it is approved in all indications it is being tested in, of $1 billion to $1.25 billion by 2015. Matthew Roden, an analyst at UBS Securities LLC, said Abraxane could generate peak global sales of around $500 million in pancreatic cancer alone, possibly rising as high as $1 billion if the survival advantage is dramatic. On the other hand, if the data is not sufficiently robust to drive high utilization, those sales could be in the $200 million range, he said in a research report. Celgene’s shares were up 4.8 percent at $74.92 on the Nasdaq on Monday morning, off an earlier high at $78.46.

39,CELG,Celgene's psoriatic arthritis drug modestly effective vs rivals,"* Celgene says 41 pct of patients saw 20 pct improvement * Safety profile remains benign; mostly nausea, diarrhea * Subgroup of patients saw significantly better results By Toni Clarke Nov 13 (Reuters) - Celgene Corp’s experimental treatment for psoriatic arthritis, apremilast, proved to be modestly effective compared with leading treatments in a late-stage study, and it showed fewer side effects, according to data released by the company on Tuesday, Data released at the annual meeting of the American College of Rheumatology showed that 41 percent of patients who took 30 milligrams of apremilast twice daily achieved a 20 percent improvement in symptoms after 16 weeks, compared with 19.4 percent who took a placebo. Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, inflammatory disease that affects the joints and causes pain, stiffness and swelling. It is associated with psoriasis, a skin disorder. The study, known as PALACE-1, is the first of three late-stage trials of the drug, a pill that inhibits an enzyme known as phosphodiesterase 4, or PDE4, and acts to damp down inflammation. The results of the remaining trials will be released within the next several months. Currently, psoriatic arthritis is treated with a variety of drugs, the most effective being injectable biologics such as Abbott Laboratories’ Humira, Amgen Inc’s  Enbrel, and Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade and Simponi. The results met the main goal of the clinical trial, but they were not as robust as the biologics. “While these efficacy results might be acceptable in a disease like psoriasis, we don’t view them as sufficient for a disease characterized by ongoing joint destruction and progressive disability,” said Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, in a recent research report based on an initial summary of the data. A table compiled by Porges shows that between 50 percent and 57 percent of patients taking standard biologics achieved a 20 percent improvement in symptoms after 24 weeks in clinical trials. Patients in the PALACE-1 trial took apremilast with or without a variety of other therapies. Celgene said that those who took apremilast alone - somewhat fewer than half the 500 patients in the trial - had a much better response than those who took the drug in combination with other treatments. About 50.8 percent of those who took 30 milligrams of apremilast twice daily as a monotherapy experienced a 20 percent improvement in symptoms. How important that figure will be to physicians remains to be seen since it is not the number Celgene will use to file for marketing approval with regulators. Only 20 percent of patients taking apremilast in the study experienced a 50 percent improvement in symptoms, and only 11 percent saw in improvement of 70 percent or more after 16 weeks. Those figures are also lower than those seen with the biologics. Celgene expects to file for U.S. approval of the drug in treating psoriatic arthritis in the first half of 2013. On the plus side, apremilast appears considerably safer than the biologic drugs, which block a protein known as tumor necrosis factor and can increase the risk of infections, certain types of cancer, and tuberculosis. The most common side effects with apremilast, which is also being tested as a treatment for psoriasis, were gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea and diarrhea. Celgene expects to begin reporting data from two late-stage studies of the drug in psoriasis by the end of this year and to file for marketing approval in the second half of next year. In Europe, the company has said it plans to file for both the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis indications together in the second half of the year.

40,CELG,Celgene's pomalidomide improves survival in multiple myeloma,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp’s experimental cancer drug pomalidomide significantly improved survival in patients with multiple myeloma who had failed other therapies, according to a summary of data to be presented at a medical meeting next month. The trial tested pomalidomide plus a low dose of dexamethasone, a standard treatment, and compared it with a high dose of dexamethasone alone. Data showed patients who had failed an average of five previous therapies who took pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone survived significantly longer than those who took high-dose dexamethasone. The company had previously reported that the drug improved survival, but the new data, the result of an interim analysis, show that no matter what occurs during the remainder of the trial, the improvement in overall survival will be highly significant. The median overall survival for patients in the pomalidomide arm of the trial has not yet been reached, while the median overall survival in the control arm was 34 weeks. From a statistical perspective, the results reflect “a very meaningful reduction in the risk of death for these refractory patients,” said Brian Abrahams, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. Detailed results will be presented in December at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology. The company had previously reported that the drug also improved progression-free survival, or the length of time patients lived before relapsing, but did not give the magnitude of improvement. The new data shows pomalidomide nearly doubled that time to 15.7 weeks from 8 weeks in the control arm. Celgene hopes the data will add weight to its application for marketing approval of the drug. The company has already filed an application with U.S. and European health regulators based on data from a mid-stage trial that tested pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone against pomalidomide alone. Median progression-free survival in that trial, the main goal of the study, was 4.7 months in the pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone arm compared with 2.7 months in the pomalidomide alone arm. Multiple myeloma is a cancer that starts in plasma cells in bone marrow and ultimately disrupts the production of normal blood cells. Geoff Meacham, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, estimates pomalidomide could generate sales of around $450 million by 2015. In July, Celgene’s chief executive, Robert Hugin, said he expects pomalidomide to eventually generate annual sales of more than $1 billion. A decision from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on whether to approve the drug is expected by February 10. Celgene already sells the multiple myeloma drug Revlimid for patients at earlier stages of disease. Patients in the pomalidomide trial had failed to respond to Revlimid. Celgene’s shares rose 0.8 percent to $74.94 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. Earlier they rose as high as $76.10.

41,CELG,"Celgene issues 2013, long-term forecasts; shares rise","(Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) on Monday forecast 2013 profit in line with Wall Street projections, introduced a long-term outlook for 2017, and said results from two late-stage trials of a drug for the skin disorder psoriasis were positive. Celgene said it plans to file an application in the second half of this year seeking U.S. approval for apremilast to treat psoriasis. It previously said it would seek approval for the oral drug as a treatment for psoriatic arthritis in the first quarter of 2013, and in Europe, for both conditions, in the second half of this year. Celgene shares rose 4.5 percent to $85.82 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. The biotechnology company forecast total sales in 2013 of $6 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $5.50 to $5.60. The forecast was roughly in line with analyst expectations for sales of $6.05 billion and earnings of $5.56 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Celgene said it sees compound annual product sales growth of 19 percent between 2013 and 2017. Celgene said it now expects to report 2012 adjusted earnings per share of about $4.90, topping analysts’ average expectations of $4.88 per share. It said sales of its lead drug, Revlimid for multiple myeloma, achieved fourth-quarter sales of just over $1 billion, and it expects 2013 sales of the drug to be between $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion. The company reaffirmed its 2015 target of $8.0 to $9.0 billion in product sales and adjusted earnings per share of $8.00 to $9.00. It introduced a 2017 target of $12 billion in sales and adjusted earnings per share of $13.00 to $14.00. “Given the new long-term guidance, the company’s stock looks unsustainably cheap to us,” Geoff Porges, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said in a research note. “With multiple important events looming, the stock looks well positioned for upside in 2013.” Celgene also announced that apremilast met the primary and major secondary goals of a pair of pivotal Phase III trials of patients with chronic psoriasis. The company said safety and tolerability of apremilast in the late-stage trials was improved over what had been observed in earlier studies.

42,CELG,"Celgene fourth-quarter profit hit by charges, revenue rises","(Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) on Thursday reported fourth-quarter net earnings fell 36 percent after it took restructuring and acquisition-related charges, but revenue rose on strong sales of its cancer drugs. The company said it is entering a new period of growth as it prepares to launch new products and seeks regulatory approval to expand its marketing of existing products, including its flagship multiple myeloma drug Revlimid, to patients at different stages of their disease or to new patient populations. The company expects this year to file for regulatory approval for its experimental drug Apremilast in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It also plans to file for approval for the expanded use of its drug Abraxane, currently approved for breast and lung cancer, to treat pancreatic cancer. And it expects to win approval shortly to sell a new drug, Pomalyst, for patients with multiple myeloma who have failed other therapies. “In 2013, we’re focused on capitalizing on the opportunities produced by the significant results of 2012, on creating new opportunities, and on accelerating our business,” Robert Hugin, the company’s chief executive, on a conference call with investment analysts. The company reiterated its previous forecast for 2013 and said that it expects revenue to double in 2017 to $12 billion from an expected $6 billion in 2013. Net income in the quarter fell to $263.1 million, or 61 cents a share, from $410 million, or 91 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 13.3 percent to $1.45 billion on strong sales of its cancer drugs. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.32 a share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.31 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. They had expected revenue of $1.46 billion. Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene reiterated its January 7 forecast for adjusted earnings in 2013 to rise roughly 13 percent to between $5.50 and $5.60 a share. It said it expected 2013 sales to rise about 11 percent to $6 billion. Sales of Revlimid, the company’s drug to treat multiple myeloma, rose 17 percent to $1 billion, driven by increased duration of therapy and strong market share. Sales of cancer drug Abraxane rose 3 percent to $106 million as a generic competitor that had been in short supply in the United States returned to full supply. Sales of Vidaza, the company’s drug for the blood disorder myelodysplastic syndromes, rose 14 percent to $216 million, driven by strong international sales that were boosted by increased market share. Celgene’s shares slipped 0.22 percent to $98 a share in morning trading on Nasdaq.

43,CELG,FDA approves Celgene drug for multiple myeloma,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators have approved a new drug from Celgene Corp for patients with multiple myeloma whose disease has worsened after being treated with other cancer drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday it approved the drug, Pomalyst, also known as pomalidomide, for the most difficult-to-treat patients. Celgene, in an emailed statement, said the drug was priced at about $10,500 per cycle, and clinical trials have shown that the typical course of treatment is about five cycles. The company filed its application based on a mid-stage, or Phase II, trial in which patients either took pomalidomide, plus a low dose of the standard treatment dexamethasone, or pomalidomide alone. Of 191 patients evaluated, 34 percent treated with the two-drug combination responded to treatment, compared with 13 percent of patients treated with pomalidomide alone. The analysis of whether patients in the treatment group lived longer has not yet been completed. Data from the trial, known as MM-002, showed that median progression-free survival, or the length of time patients lived before relapsing, was 4.7 months in the pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone arm, versus 2.7 months in the pomalidomide-alone arm. The FDA will require the Pomalyst label to carry a “boxed warning” alerting patients and healthcare professionals that the drug should not be given to pregnant women because it can cause life-threatening birth defects, and that it can cause blood clots. Celgene is also required to institute a risk management program for Pomalyst, which is designed to work by enlisting the body’s immune system to attack cancer cells. The new drug comes from the same family as Celgene’s existing drug Revlimid but appears to help patients who have become resistant to current therapies, including Revlimid and its predecessor drug Thalomid. Multiple myeloma is a cancer that starts in plasma cells in bone marrow and ultimately disrupts the production of normal blood cells. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be about 22,300 new cases diagnosed in 2013 and 10,700 deaths. A variety of new drugs have entered the market during the last few years, often allowing patients to live years longer. Last July, for example, the FDA approved Kyprolis, a drug made by Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc for patients with multiple myeloma who had received at least two prior therapies. “Pomalyst marks the second treatment to receive accelerated approval in the last seven months, which is unparalleled in any other cancer,” the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation said in a statement. In addition to MM-002, Celgene conducted a late-stage trial known as MM-003 in Europe that tested pomalidomide plus a low dose of dexamethasone versus a high dose of dexamethasone alone. Results of that trial have been submitted to European regulators and the company expects to hear whether the drug has been approved there later this year. They were not included in the package submitted for FDA approval. Data from the European trial showed patients who had failed an average of five previous therapies who took pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone survived significantly longer than those who took high-dose dexamethasone. The median overall survival when the data was reported in November had not yet been reached in the pomalidomide group, while the median overall survival in the control arm was 34 weeks. The results show that no matter what occurs during the remainder of the trial, the improvement in overall survival will be highly statistically significant. Geoff Meacham, an analyst at J.P.

48,CELG,"Celgene drug shown to be effective, safe in psoriasis trial","(Reuters) - Celgene Corp’s experimental drug apremilast proved to be more effective than a dummy pill for psoriasis patients in a late-stage study, clearing the way for the company to file for U.S. regulatory approval in the second half of 2013. Celgene said 59 percent of patients in the 844-patient trial achieved a 50 percent improvement in symptoms at 16 weeks, using a standard score of the severity and extent of psoriasis, compared with 17 percent of placebo patients. A 75 percent improvement in symptoms was seen in 33 percent of the treatment group and 5 percent of the placebo group. The Phase 3 trial is the first of two pivotal studies of the drug in patients with psoriasis, a disease in which itchy, painful skin plaques are thought to be caused by an inflammatory response initiated by the body’s immune system. Apremilast is a pill that inhibits an enzyme known as phosphodiesterase 4, or PDE4, and acts to damp down inflammation. Celgene said previously it planned to file for Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug as a treatment for psoriatic arthritis in the first quarter of this year. Side effects were consistent with those seen in earlier trials of the drug, with the most common being diarrhea and nausea. Celgene said no cases of tuberculosis or lymphoma were observed through Week 16, and there was no increase in risk of cardiovascular events or serious opportunistic infection. “From a physician’s perspective, this can definitely be a first-line therapy because of the excellent risk/benefit profile,” said Dr. Richard Langley, director of dermatology research at Dalhousie University in Halifax, and one of the study’s lead investigators. “I think the patient acceptance of this drug and the physician acceptance is going to be extremely high.” He noted that most psoriasis patients are currently treated with methotrexate, which can cause serious side effects.

49,CELG,"Celgene drug shown to be effective, safe in psoriasis trial","March 2 (Reuters) - Celgene Corp’s experimental drug apremilast proved to be more effective than a dummy pill for psoriasis patients in a late-stage study, clearing the way for the company to file for U.S. regulatory approval in the second half of 2013. Celgene said 59 percent of patients in the 844-patient trial achieved a 50 percent improvement in symptoms at 16 weeks, using a standard score of the severity and extent of psoriasis, compared with 17 percent of placebo patients. A 75 percent improvement in symptoms was seen in 33 percent of the treatment group and 5 percent of the placebo group. The Phase 3 trial is the first of two pivotal studies of the drug in patients with psoriasis, a disease in which itchy, painful skin plaques are thought to be caused by an inflammatory response initiated by the body’s immune system. Apremilast is a pill that inhibits an enzyme known as phosphodiesterase 4, or PDE4, and acts to damp down inflammation. Celgene said previously it planned to file for Food and Drug Administration approval of the drug as a treatment for psoriatic arthritis in the first quarter of this year. Side effects were consistent with those seen in earlier trials of the drug, with the most common being diarrhea and nausea. Celgene said no cases of tuberculosis or lymphoma were observed through Week 16, and there was no increase in risk of cardiovascular events or serious opportunistic infection. “From a physician’s perspective, this can definitely be a first-line therapy because of the excellent risk/benefit profile,” said Dr. Richard Langley, director of dermatology research at Dalhousie University in Halifax, and one of the study’s lead investigators. “I think the patient acceptance of this drug and the physician acceptance is going to be extremely high.” He noted that most psoriasis patients are currently treated with methotrexate, which can cause serious side effects.

56,CELG,UPDATE 1-Celgene's Revlimid wins FDA lymphoma approval,"June 5 (Reuters) - Celgene Corp said on Wednesday that its flagship blood cancer drug, Revlimid, was approved by U.S. health regulators to treat mantle cell lymphoma, adding another revenue source for the $4 billion-a-year medicine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Revlimid to treat mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) - a type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma - that has relapsed or progressed following two prior treatment regimens, one of which must include Takeda Pharmaceutical Co’s Velcade. “There remains a tremendous unmet need for patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma,” Dr Andre Goy, chairman and director and chief of lymphoma at the John Theurer Cancer Center in Hackensack, New Jersey, said in a statement. Revlimid, which will be the first oral treatment for MCL, is already approved to treat multiple myeloma and the blood disorder myelodysplastic syndromes. The medicine had sales of $1 billion in the first quarter for the U.S. biotechnology company. Despite the unmet need cited by doctors, analysts predicted only a modest revenue boost for Revlimid from the new indication. Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt forecast additional annual sales of about $100 million to $200 million from the additional approval, saying it was not likely to provide a boost to Celgene’s shares. MCL accounts for about 6 percent to 7 percent of total non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cases, or about 11,000 cases, the company said.

58,CELG,Celgene arthritis drug maintains efficacy at 52 weeks-study,"June 11 (Reuters) - Celgene Corp’s experimental drug for psoriatic arthritis maintained its ability to significantly reduce painful symptoms through 52 weeks of treatment, according to data from a late stage study being presented this week at a medical meeting. The U.S. biotechnology company had previously released positive data from the 500-patient Phase III trial called Palace-1 that compared its drug, apremilast, to a placebo through 16 weeks of treatment. The data being presented at the European League Against Rheumatism in Madrid followed those patients through 52 weeks of treatment to assess longer term effectiveness and safety of apremilast. At 52 weeks, 63 percent of patients who received 20 milligrams of apremilast twice daily and 55 percent who took 30 mg of the Celgene drug twice a day achieved at least a 20 percent reduction in signs and symptoms of the disease, such as painful, swollen or tender joints - a measure known as ACR 20. That represented an improvement over time of the ACR 20 rates seen at 16 weeks. At that point of the study, 31.5 percent of the 20 mg patients and 50.8 percent of the 30 mg patients had achieved ACR 20. Improvements were also seen in the number of patients who achieved 50 percent and 70 percent reductions in signs and symptoms of the disease as well, Celgene said. At 52 weeks, 24.8 percent of those who got the 20 mg dose reached ACR 50 and 15.4 percent achieved ACR 70. For the higher dose of apremilast, 24.6 percent achieved ACR 50 and 13.8 percent hit ACR 70. Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory condition in which joint pain is caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissues. It affects about 30 percent of those who suffer from the painful and unsightly skin condition psoriasis. Celgene earlier this year applied for U.S. approval for apremilast to treat psoriatic arthritis based on the results of this and two other late stage trials. It is planning to seek U.S. approval for apremilast to treat psoriasis later this year. Patients in the Palace-1 study had previously been treated with oral disease modifying drugs, such as methotrexate, and/or biotech treatments known as anti-TNF drugs, such at AbbVie’s  Humira. It also included patients who failed to be helped by prior treatment with anti-TNF drugs. Apremilast is a pill that inhibits an enzyme known as phosphodiesterase 4, or PDE4, and acts to reduce inflammation. No serious safety issues, such as major heart problems, cancers, opportunistic infections or tuberculosis were reported for the 52 weeks of the trial. Based on the results, apremilast appears to be somewhat less effective but safer than the widely used injected biologic anti-TNF medicines. “There is a high unmet medical need for additional efficacious, well-tolerated treatment options for patients with psoriatic arthritis,” Dr. Arthur Kavanaugh, who will present the data in Madrid, said through an email.",6112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/celgene-arthritis/celgene-arthritis-drug-maintains-efficacy-at-52-weeks-study-idUSL2N0EN21P20130611

Indexes came off their session highs not long after the opening bell on Wall Street. Hewlett-Packard was the biggest gainer on the blue chip Dow after its chief executive said revenue growth was “still possible” in fiscal 2014. The computer maker was up 4.6 percent at $25.36. The benchmark S&P; 500 had dropped 1 percent Tuesday in volatile trading after Japan’s central bank disappointed markets by holding its monetary policy steady. The lack of further action by the Bank of Japan kindled unease over when the ultra-loose policy put in place by global central banks will be wound down, particularly by the Federal Reserve. Monetary efforts to boost the economic recovery have been a pillar of the rally in U.S. equities this year, and uncertainty over when the measures will be reined in has prompted investors to unwind trades built around such support. “We’re not getting a lot of direction but volatility has definitely come into play here,” said Joe Bell, a senior equity analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati. “There’s a bit of uncertainty right now,” he said. “It seems like every other week, there’s a rumor about when or if this quantitative easing is going to end, how much longer stimulus is going to be in place.” The Dow Jones industrial average gained 38.78 points, or 0.26 percent, to 15,160.80. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  added 4.68 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,630.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 5.14 points, or 0.15 percent, at 3,442.09.

The company’s shares were up 7 percent at $133.07 in morning  trade. Analysts said the data was largely expected and will also pave the way for a European approval application for the drug. Celgene had withdrawn the European marketing application for a wider use of the drug in June 2012, after regulators asked for more data. “We note that this news removes a key overhang for Celgene as with these data, they can now file for approval in the EU ... (The) EU filing may come by end of the year,” Deutsche Bank Analyst Robyn Karnauskas wrote in a note. Celgene said it will start discussions with regulators and plans to submit applications in the United States, Europe and other markets. Regulatory decision from United States and European agencies are expected in 2015, analysts said. Revlimid is Celgene’s flagship blood cancer drug and is already approved for use in multiple myeloma patients who have failed at least one prior therapy, mantle cell lymphoma and transfusion-dependent anemia caused by myelodysplastic syndromes - a blood disorder. The late-stage study tested the oral drug in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, and showed a statistically significant improvement in survival without the cancer worsening. The evaluation of safety and efficacy was ongoing and the results will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, Celgene said. Deutsche Bank’s Karnauskas said that while the magnitude of benefit with continuous Revlimid usage was not disclosed, she expected progression-free survival in the group to be 35-36 months. “Notably, we expect control arm to do 25-26 months in this study,” she said. Multiple myeloma is the second most commonly diagnosed blood cancer. It starts in the plasma cells in the bone marrow and ultimately disrupts the production of normal blood cells. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be about 22,350 new cases diagnosed in 2013 and about 10,710 deaths. Revlimid, Celgene’s most important growth driver, brought in sales of about $1 billion during the first quarter. The approval for mantle cell lymphoma came in early last month. According Thomson Reuters Pharma, Revlimid annual sales are expected to reach $4.2 billion in 2013 and $5.37 billion in 2015.",7112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/celgene-study-myeloma/update-2-market-for-celgene-blood-cancer-drug-seen-growing-after-trial-idUSL4N0FH2XP20130711

Revlimid, with 2012 sales of $3.8 billion, is Celgene’s flagship blood cancer drug and is already approved for use in various types of blood cancer, including multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Celgene shares were down 2.7 percent at $132.98 on Thursday afternoon on the Nasdaq. Over the past 12 months, the shares have nearly doubled. The trial was placed on a clinical hold by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on July 12, Celgene said. The study was testing the drug in previously untreated, elderly patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Several Wall Street analysts said closure of the trial would have no impact on their sales estimates for Revlimid, which continues to be studied in other CLL and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patient populations. “The body of evidence for Revlimid in myeloma includes thousands of patients in clinical studies, has never revealed any death imbalance in any myeloma setting and regardless of combination use with any other agent,” Brean Capital analyst Gene Mack said in a research note.

Sales of the company’s flagship blood cancer drug Revlimid, approved for use in multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma and a blood disorder, rose 13 percent to $1.05 billion, driven by market share gains. Multiple myeloma is the second-most-commonly diagnosed blood cancer. Revlimid has been in the news after Celgene said last week that it would stop a late-stage trial of the drug due to a higher number of deaths in leukemia patients taking the drug compared with those on another treatment. Analysts, however, had said the trial closure would not affect their sales estimates for the drug that brought in sales of $3.8 billion in 2012. Sales of another big growth engine for Celgene, Abraxane, used to treat breast and lung cancer, rose 41 percent to $155 million, helped by its strong demand in the United States for use in lung cancer. Celgene’s new multiple myeloma treatment, Pomalyst, sold $66 million in its first full quarter of sales. The drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February and is expected to reach the billion-dollar sales mark by 2016. Shares of Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene closed at $135.99 on the Nasdaq on Wednesday.

72,CELG,FDA okays Celgene's Abraxane for pancreatic cancer,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Friday approved use of Celgene Corp’s Abraxane to treat patients with pancreatic cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, citing a trial that showed the drug significantly prolonged survival. The medicine is already approved in the United States to treat lung cancer and breast cancer. Celgene in January said Abraxane helped patients with advanced pancreatic cancer live an average of two months longer than those treated with chemotherapy, according to a late-stage study. Moreover, a significantly higher percentage of Abraxane users survived for up to two years. Patients who received Abraxane in combination with the chemotherapy agent gemcitabine had a median overall survival of 8.5 months, compared with 6.7 months for patients who received standard therapy of gemcitabine alone. The result was deemed to be statistically significant. Abraxane plus gemcitabine demonstrated a 59 percent increase in one-year survival, 35 percent vs 22 percent. The combination also doubled the percentage of patients who survived for two years from the start of treatment, with 9 percent still alive compared with 4 percent for gemcitabine alone. Researchers said it was the first study in advanced pancreatic cancer to report two-year survivors.

75,CELG,Celgene raises 2013 forecast as profit beats estimates,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp raised its earnings forecast for 2013 on Thursday after reporting slightly higher-than-expected quarterly profit on robust sales of its flagship blood cancer drug Revlimid and rapid growth in newer cancer treatments. While Revlimid remains the backbone of the company, Celgene’s newer products are off to an impressive start. Pomalyst, a multiple myeloma drug for patients who have received treatment with at least two prior therapies, had sales of $90 million in its second full quarter on the market, up 35 percent from the prior quarter. That included $77 million in the United States, outpacing Amgen Inc’s new rival drug Kyprolis, which had sales of $65 million in the third quarter. Celgene officials told analysts on a conference call that Pomalyst was rapidly gaining market share. “Folks need to rethink their expectations going forward for that drug,” Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. “It’s just easily besting our expectations.” Helped by its recent approval for pancreatic cancer in addition to growing use in lung and breast cancer, sales of Abraxane jumped 60 percent to $170 million, above expectations of about $167 million. Celgene is likely to add another potentially lucrative new product to its portfolio early next year. U.S. regulators are expected to make an approval decision in March on apremilast for psoriatic arthritis. Excluding special items such as collaboration costs, Celgene earned $1.56 per share in the third quarter, beating analysts’ average expectation by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results prompted Celgene to boost its 2013 earnings forecast for a third time this year. It now expects to earn an adjusted $5.90 to $5.95 a share, up from a previous forecast of $5.80 to $5.90 a share. The company sees total product sales in 2013 exceeding its previous outlook of $6.2 billion, with Revlimid sales coming in at the mid to upper end of a $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion range. The quarterly results, which exceeded analysts’ estimates, may have fallen short of lofty investor expectations. Celgene shares, which have doubled this year, were off 1.7 percent in morning trade on Nasdaq. “While this was a good quarter and a nice little beat and raise, people expected at least as much, if not a little more,” said Cowen’s Schmidt. “So everything is great, but high expectations may have the stock down.” Net profit for the quarter fell due to higher expenses for product launches and clinical trials. Net profit declined to $372 million, or 87 cents a share, from $424 million, or 97 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 17.6 percent to $1.67 billion, slightly exceeding Wall Street estimates of $1.64 billion. Revlimid sales increased 12 percent from a year ago to $1.09 billion, in line with estimates. Revlimid sales were fueled by market share gains and by patients using the drug for longer periods, the company said. Its sales could grow significantly if it wins expanded approval for use in newly diagnosed patients based on upcoming results of a large, late-stage study. Sales of Vidaza for the blood disorder myelodysplastic syndrome were flat at $220 million and down 6 percent in the United States, where it began facing competition from a cheaper generic version last month. The decline will accelerate rapidly as multiple generics come onto the market. Selling, general and administrative costs rose to $405 million from $323 million a year ago, while research and development expenses increased to $372 million from $328 million. Chief Financial Officer Jacqualyn Fouse said SG&A; expenses should trend downward in the fourth quarter but that R&D; costs may go up.

78,CELG,"Celgene arthritis drug appears effective, safe after one year: study","(Reuters) - Previously untreated patients experienced significant and lasting reductions in signs and symptoms of psoriatic arthritis when given Celgene Corp’s experimental oral drug, apremilast, according to data from a late stage clinical trial. Patients taking either the 20 milligrams or 30 mg dose of apremilast twice a day had a statistically significant improvement in symptoms, such as painful, swollen joints, after 16 weeks of treatment compared with those who received a placebo, researchers said. Signs and symptoms of the painful disease continued to improve on apremilast through a year of treatment, according to data to be presented next week at the American College of Rheumatology meeting in San Diego. If approved, apremilast will compete with injected biotech medicines that have proved to be highly effective, but have more serious potential side effects, such as opportunistic infections and tuberculosis because the biologics suppress the immune system. “Psoriatic arthritis can be one of the most crippling types of arthritis that we see,” said Dr. Alvin Wells, the lead investigator of the 527-patient study who will present the data at the ACR meeting on Tuesday. “To be able to have a patient that can take a pill twice a day, I think this is going to be a game changer, not only for me as a physician, but for my patients. They’re going to have a new treatment option,” added Wells, director of the Rheumatology and Immunotherapy Center in Franklin, Wisconsin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to make an decision on the drug in March. Celgene has said sales of apremilast could reach $1.5 billion by 2017. Wall Street analysts’ projections have been more modest, with RBC Capital Markets forecasting sales of $1 billion in 2017, while Cowen and Co sees annual sales reaching $475 million in 2018. The primary goal of the study dubbed Palace 4 was a 20 percent reduction in signs and symptoms of the disease, known as ACR20, after 16 weeks versus placebo. At that point, 29.2 percent of those who got the 20 mg dose and 32.3 percent to took 30 mg achieved ACR 20, compared with 16.9 percent on placebo. After 52 weeks on the drug, 53.4 percent on the lower dose and 58.7 percent on the higher dose achieved an ACR20 response. “These patients are on drug a long time so I want to see that it’s going to last,” said Wells, calling the results “a pretty dramatic response.” Placebo patients who did not respond early in the trial were switched to apremilast. By week 24 there were no longer any patients receiving placebo, Wells explained. Researchers also looked at how many patients experienced improvements of 50 percent and 70 percent. At 52 weeks, for those on the higher dose of apremilast, 31.9 percent had achieved ACR50 and 18.1 percent ACR70, researchers said. About 125 million people worldwide suffer from the scaly skin condition psoriasis and about 30 percent of them can develop psoriatic arthritis, a chronic, progressive disease in which joints become swollen and inflamed. Apremilast is the first drug in a new class of medicine called PDE4 inhibitors. “It inhibits an enzyme involved in making all these angry proteins that get into the skin, causing psoriasis, and they also get into the joints, causing arthritis,” Wells said. The most common side effects with apremilast were diarrhea, nausea and headache. No more serious adverse side effects were reported, and fewer than 2 percent of patients in the study discontinued treatment due to side effects.

OncoMed will get upfront payments of $177.25 million, including $22.25 million for new stock that would give Celgene a stake of about 5 percent, the companies said. The deal gives Celgene an entry into the market for treatments targeting cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells play a significant role in the establishment, spread and recurrence of cancer. OncoMed said it would conduct the initial clinical studies on five of the drugs, giving Celgene the option to license them based on the trial results. Celgene will also get an option to license OncoMed’s most advanced clinical candidate, demcizumab, during or after the completion of certain mid-stage trials. The drug is in early-stage development in combination with standard-of-care therapy for non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. OncoMed, based in Redwood City, California, is eligible to receive up to $790 million in development, regulatory and commercial milestones for demcizumab. “Demcizumab’s substantial early clinical activity warrants aggressive yet careful evaluation in several indications where we have strength”, said Tom Daniel, Celgene’s president of global research and early development. OncoMed is eligible to get up to $3 billion in milestone payments if Celgene exercises all its options and all six drugs are approved.

84,CELG,UPDATE 3-Celgene raises forecasts on cancer drug sales strength,"By Bill Berkrot Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. biotech company Celgene Corp  raised sales and profit forecasts for 2015 and 2017 on Monday, saying its improved long-term outlook was based on current momentum for its blood cancer medicines. The relatively conservative increases, however, and a 2014 forecast that was slightly lower than current Wall Street estimates, dampened shareholder enthusiasm and Celgene shares fell more than 3 percent. “While Celgene tends to be conservative with its guidance, we believe heightened expectations had set a high bar for the stock (prior) to today’s release,” Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. Celgene shares had been rising over the past few weeks, touching a new all-time high prior to Monday’s announcement. “The numbers for 2014 are a little light of expectations and the stock has been very strong heading into this announcement, so some sell off was probably inevitable,” said Geoffrey Porges, analyst with Sanford Bernstein. Celgene raised the 2017 forecast for its flagship drug Revlimid by $1 billion to $7 billion, and now expects 2017 sales of $1.5 billion for its newer blood cancer drug Pomalyst, up from a prior view of $1 billion. Celgene Chief Executive Robert Hugin told analysts and investors that the early sale performance of Pomalyst “certainly exceeded our expectations in the U.S. and Europe.” Celgene Chief Financial Officer Jacqualyn Fourse, in a breakout session following the formal presentation, appeared to leave room for future forecast increases, saying that the numbers “can evolve.” She called the forecasts “a new base case” and said the outlook was “based on conservative estimates of worldwide pricing.” Fourse also said further upside could be driven by positive results from ongoing late-stage clinical trials. In addition, the long-term forecasts were based on expected growth only from Celgene’s blood cancer drugs, which does not take into account potential sales strides by Abraxane, its drug for breast cancer and other solid tumor cancers. “Abraxane continues to have very meaningful growth,” JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham said in a research note. The forecasts were issued during Celgene’s presentation at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco. For 2014, Celgene expects sales of $7.3 billion to $7.4 billion and adjusted earnings, excluding one-time items, of $7 to $7.20 per share. Analysts, on average, are looking for sales of $7.43 billion and earnings of $7.29 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The 2014 guidance looks solid and potentially conservative, given strong commercial momentum,” Meacham said. For 2015, Celgene now expects sales of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion and adjusted earnings of $9 to $9.50 per share, up from its prior view of sales of $8 billion to $9 billion and EPS of $8 to $9. For 2017, Celgene sees sales growing to $13 billion to $14 billion, up from its prior view of at least $12 billion, and adjusted earnings of a about $15 per share versus its earlier forecast of $13 to $14 per share. “While positive, we think the magnitude of this guidance raise is generally in-line with buy-side expectations,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said. The company also provided preliminary results for the fourth quarter of 2013, saying it expects to report adjusted earnings of $1.51 per share, including a 10 cent per share impact from collaboration-related payments. That would be about 4 cents shy of average analysts’ expectations of $1.55 per share.

The forecasts were issued during Celgene’s presentation at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco. For 2014, Celgene expects sales of $7.3 billion to $7.4 billion and adjusted earnings, excluding one-time items, of $7 to $7.20 per share. Analysts, on average, are looking for sales of $7.43 billion and earnings of $7.29 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The 2014 guidance looks solid and potentially conservative, given strong commercial momentum,” Meacham said. For 2015, Celgene now expects sales of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion and adjusted earnings of $9 to $9.50 per share, up from its prior view of sales of $8 billion to $9 billion and EPS of $8 to $9. For 2017, Celgene sees sales growing to $13 billion to $14 billion, up from its prior view of at least $12 billion, and adjusted earnings of a about $15 per share versus its earlier forecast of $13 to $14 per share. “While positive, we think the magnitude of this guidance raise is generally in-line with buy-side expectations,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said. Celgene shares were down $5.80, or 3.4 percent, at $164.01 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

87,CELG,UPDATE 2-U.S. FDA approves Celgene drug for psoriatic arthritis,"(Adds treatment price, details on how drug works, updates share price) By Bill Berkrot March 21 (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators approved on Friday a Celgene Corp drug to treat psoriatic arthritis, a type of arthritis associated with the skin disease psoriasis that causes joint pain, stiffness and swelling. The drug, a pill known chemically as apremilast, will be sold under the brand name Otezla. It is also being studied by the U.S. biotechnology company as a treatment for psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. Celgene projects Otezla sales of $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year by 2017. “We’re cautious about achievability of management’s guidance for this product,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said. “It’s a highly competitive category and there are a lot of drugs with greater efficacy,” added Porges, who forecasts annual sales will reach $800 million by 2019. Celgene has set a wholesale price of about $22,500 for a year of treatment. It expects to begin selling the medicine this month. Both Porges and ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said the price was higher than they had expected even though it represents about a 25 percent discount to current biologic market leaders. Otezla works by blocking an enzyme called PDE4, or phosphodiesterase 4, associated with inflammation. It offers the convenience of being a pill, while the current leading treatments are injected drugs. “Relief of pain and inflammation and improving physical function are important treatment goals for patients with active psoriatic arthritis,” Curtis Rosebraugh, director of the Food and Drug Administration Office of Drug Evaluation II, said in a statement. “Otezla provides a new treatment option for patients suffering from this disease,” he added. The FDA is expected to make a decision by September on Otezla for psoriasis, a much larger market than psoriatic arthritis. “We think that the psoriatic arthritis market will be a solid fit for Otezla given the dissatisfaction with current drugs,” Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Mara Goldstein said in a research note. “We think the drug has a good chance of widespread use.” Current treatments for the condition include corticosteroids and a class of injected biotech medicines known as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, such as AbbVie Inc’s  Humira and Enbrel from Amgen Inc. The TNF blockers are highly effective but have more potentially serious side effects. As a condition of approval, the FDA is requiring a registry of pregnant women who use the drug so it can assess the risks to them related to Otezla exposure, the agency said. It also said Otezla patients should be monitored for potentially significant weight loss. If unexplained or clinically significant weight loss occurs, the weight loss should be evaluated and discontinuation of treatment should be considered, the FDA said. In clinical trials, the Celgene drug was also associated with an increase in reports of depression by a small percentage of patients. Celgene shares, which had been off as much as 4.6 percent amid a wider biotech selloff on Friday, recovered somewhat and closed down $5.61, or 3.7 percent, at $144.40 on Nasdaq.

90,CELG,"Mylan sues Celgene for blocking Revlimid, Thalomid generics","(Reuters) - Mylan Inc on Thursday sued Celgene Corp to stop the latter’s effort to keep generic versions of two drugs that generate $4.5 billion of annual sales off the market. The lawsuit accuses Celgene of maintaining unlawful monopolies over Revlimid, which treats disorders caused by poorly formed blood cells; and Thalomid, which treats lesions associated with a variation of Hansen’s Disease, or leprosy. Revlimid is a branded version of lenalidomide, and is a derivative of thalidomide, a drug introduced in the 1950s for which Thalomid is a branded version. Mylan said both drugs can cost more than $100,000 for a year’s supply. In its lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in Newark, New Jersey, Mylan accused Celgene of using federal limits on the distribution of Revlimid and Thalomid, which were designed to promote the drugs’ safety, as a pretext to keep generic drug makers from obtaining their own samples. Mylan said this prevents generic drug makers from conducting “bioequivalence” tests required by U.S. regulators before generic drugs can be launched. “The effect of Celgene’s conduct is that no generic manufacturer, including Mylan, has been able to bring generic versions of Thalomid and/or Revlimid to market,” Mylan said. “Through its illegal actions, Celgene has foreclosed Mylan from even attempting to enter the market.” Greg Geissman, a Celgene spokesman, declined to comment. Celgene is based in Summit, New Jersey, and Mylan is based in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. The lawsuit seeks to force Celgene to sell Mylan enough Revlimid and Thalomid at market prices to allow for bioequivalence testing. It also seeks compensation for Mylan’s inability to sell generic versions of both, and triple damages. In a February 13 regulatory filing, Celgene said it sold $4.28 billion of Revlimid and $244.5 million of Thalomid in 2013, together accounting for nearly 70 percent of all revenue. Celgene also said its exclusive U.S. rights, whether through patents or primary regulatory approvals, to Revlimid and Thalomid expire in 2027 and 2023, respectively.

92,CELG,Celgene profit down but tops expectations; keeps forecast,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) on Thursday reported a slightly higher-than-expected first-quarter profit on increased sales of its flagship multiple myeloma drug Revlimid and other oncology products. Excluding special items, Celgene had adjusted earnings of $1.67 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net profit fell due to higher research and development costs and increased expenses for launching Abraxane for pancreatic cancer and its new medicines for psoriatic arthritis and multiple myeloma, although the company maintained its full year forecasts as sales also increased. The U.S. biotechnology company posted a net profit of $280 million, or 66 cents per share, compared with a profit of $385 million, or 89 cents per share, a year earlier. Celgene said it continues to expect 2014 revenue of $7.5 billion and adjusted earnings of $7.00 to $7.20 per share. The company sees full-year Revlimid sales of $4.9 billion to $5.0 billion and Abraxane sales of $850 million to $900 million. Total sales for the quarter rose 19 percent to $1.71 billion, just shy of Wall Street estimates of $1.76 billion. Sales of Revlimid rose 14 percent to $1.14 billion for the quarter, which was about in line with Wall Street estimates. The company said it has filed for U.S. and European approval to use the medicine as a first line treatment for multiple myeloma, a label expansion that is widely viewed as the next big sales catalyst for the drug. Sales of Abraxane for breast, lung and pancreatic cancer rose 51 percent to $185 million, falling short of analysts’ expectations of about $212 million. Separately, Celgene added to its pipeline of drugs in development by announcing a global license agreement with privately-held Nogra Pharma Ltd to develop and sell a drug for Crohn’s disease and other indications.

99,CELG,Celgene drug can drive HIV out of hiding: study,"LONDON (Reuters) - An anti-cancer drug made by the U.S. biotech firm Celgene can re-activate hidden HIV in patients so that it can be detected, bringing researchers closer to being able to treat it, Danish scientists said on Tuesday. In a small study presented at an international AIDS conference in Australia, the researchers said the finding was a “step in the right direction” toward finding a cure for the viral disease but that many years of research are still needed. “There is still a long way to go and many obstacles to overcome before we can start talking about a cure against HIV,” said Ole Schmeltz Sogaard, who led the research team from Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, in a statement. The drug, known generically as romidepsin and under the brand name Istodax, is licensed to treat a type of cancer called T-cell lymphoma. In this study, however, it was investigated as a potential HIV therapy. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can be kept at very low levels by anti-AIDS drugs, but there is still no cure that can eradicate HIV from the body.  Some 35 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, and the global AIDS epidemic has killed 39 million since it began in the 1980s, according to the latest data from the United Nations AIDS program, UNAIDS.  Scientists working to find a cure know the virus can hide in a state of hibernation in cells called CD4 cells, which are part of the body’s immune system. CD4 cells cannot fight the AIDS virus themselves, but killer T-cells can if they are able to tell whether or not a CD4 cell contains the hibernating HIV.      Sharon Lewin, co-chair of the AIDS2014 conference in Melbourne Australia and a professor of infectious diseases who was not directly involved in this study, said the results of the study were significant and encouraging because they showed “we can wake up the virus reservoir and make enough of (it) to leave the cell, making it visible to an immune response”. The Danish team gave three once-weekly infusions of romidepsin to six HIV-positive adult patients who were already taking antiretroviral AIDS drugs and whose so-called “viral load” was undetectable. They found that romidepsin increased the virus production in HIV-infected cells between 2.1 and 3.9 times above normal and that the viral load in the blood increased to measurable levels in five out of six patients. “We have now shown that we can activate a hibernating virus with romidepsin and that the activated virus moves into the bloodstream in large amounts,” Schmeltz Sogaard said in a statement about the results. When the virus is activated and moves toward the bloodstream it leaves a trace on the outside of the infected CD4 cells, he explained. In principle, this means killer T-cells would be able to trace and destroy the HIV-infected CD4 cells. The Danish team said the next step is a larger trial where the researchers will combine romidepsin activation of hidden HIV with an experimental vaccine called Vacc-4x being developed by  the Norwegian biotech firm Bionor Pharma to strengthen the ability of T-cells to fight HIV.

The Danish team said the next step is a larger trial where the researchers will combine romidepsin activation of hidden HIV with an experimental vaccine called Vacc-4x being developed by  the Norwegian biotech firm Bionor Pharma to strengthen the ability of T-cells to fight HIV.

101,CELG,Celgene profit rises but revised outlook disappoints,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) reported a 25 percent rise in second-quarter profit, edging out Wall Street expectations, but a raised 2014 forecast failed to excite investors and its shares fell nearly 4 percent. The U.S. biotechnology company said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $3.60 to $3.65 per share and revenue of  $7.60 billion. It had previously forecast earnings of $3.50 to $3.60 per share and revenue of $7.50 billion. “They beat by a penny and raised guidance but only met consensus (expectation), which was already above management’s projections,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. “So lots of biotech investors are continuing to flock to Gilead and Biogen, which have more near-term earnings upside and catalysts coming.” Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) and Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) on Wednesday both crushed Wall Street earnings expectations as Gilead’s new hepatitis drug Sovaldi racked up a stunning $3.5 billion in second-quarter sales and Biogen’s multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera continued one of the most impressive new drug launches overshadowed only by Sovaldi.  “Celgene was fine but disappointed the bulls after a big recent stock run to its all time highs,” said Yee. Celgene, which is expected to have several potential catalysts for share increases in 2015, had seen its shares rise nearly 30 percent since early April. Net profit rose to $597.8 million, or 72 cents per share,  from $478.1 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier, driven by increased duration of therapy for the company’s flagship cancer drug Revlimid. Its sales rose 15 percent to $1.21 billion for the quarter. Excluding special items, Celgene earned 90 cents per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The next big catalyst for Revlimid will be a U.S. Food and Drug Administration decision expected in February on whether the drug can be used as a first-line, or initial, therapy for multiple myeloma rather than after a prior treatment has failed.  Sales of Abraxane for breast, lung and pancreatic cancer jumped 39 percent to $215 million.  The company expects full-year Revlimid sales of $4.95 billion and Abraxane sales of $850 million to $900 million. Total revenue rose 17 percent to $1.87 billion. Celgene’s Otezla for psoriatic arthritis had just $5 million in sales in its first quarter as most new patients began therapy with free samples, the company said. “We are highly confident in our forecast for Otezla sales in the second half and beyond,” Chief Financial Officer Jacqualyn Fouse said on a conference call. Celgene has forecast annual Otezla sales reaching $1.5 billion to $2 billion by 2017. It said Otezla sales in July would exceed second-quarter sales, and it could win expanded U.S. approval in September for  psoriasis. Celgene shares were down $3.36, or 3.7 percent, at $85.75.

The drug is also being studied as a potential treatment for a type of spondylitis. Celgene forecast in March annual Otezla sales of $1.5 billion to $2 billion by 2017.

109,CELG,Celgene profit jumps 37 percent; set to move Crohn's drug forward,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) on Thursday reported third-quarter profit rose 37 percent on a double-digit rise in sales of its flagship multiple myeloma drug Revlimid, and the U.S. biotechnology company expressed great confidence in a closely-watched treatment for Crohn’s disease it recently acquired. Celgene shares jumped 5 percent after the company said it was finalizing plans to move the Crohn’s drug, GED-301, into Phase III trials following a presentation at a medical meeting this week of midstage data that showed high and durable remission rates. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee called the data “strikingly positive” and said the company’s comments gave investors a lot of confidence in the drug. “It could be a multibillion-dollar opportunity,” he said. Celgene also raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast by five cents and now expects $3.65 to $3.70 per share. It also now sees 2014 revenue exceeding its previous forecast of $7.60 billion. Revlimid sales increased 19 percent to $1.3 billion as patients were using the medicine for a longer duration. Analysts  were looking for sales of $1.26 billion.  A U.S. Food and Drug Administration decision is expected in February on whether Revlimid can be used as an initial therapy rather than after a prior treatment has failed, which would boost sales. A similar decision pending in Europe is expected in the first half of next year, Celgene said. The company also plans to present data in December with an eye toward significantly increasing the number of patients eligible to receive Revlimid for the blood disorder myelodysplastic syndromes. Celgene said net profit rose to $508 million, or 61 cents per share, from $372 million, or 43 cents per share on a stock split adjusted basis, a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Celgene earned 97 cents a share, exceeding the average analysts’ estimate by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue totaled $1.98 billion, versus the Wall Street estimate of $1.96 billion. Sales of Abraxane for breast, lung and pancreatic cancer of $212 million fell short of analysts’ estimates of $232 million. Celgene said U.S. sales were hurt by competition in breast cancer, but expects pancreatic sales to rise in Europe as the launch there accelerates. The company expects full-year Revlimid sales to slightly exceed $4.95 billion and Abraxane sales to reach $850 million. Celgene’s newer multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst had sales of $181 million for the quarter, topping Wall Street estimates of $176 million. “Revlimid and Pomalyst were particularly strong,” Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. Psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla had sales of just $18 million in its first full quarter. A September U.S. approval of Otezla for the skin condition psoriasis, which has a far larger patient population than the related arthritic condition, should help jumpstart sales of the new medicine. Celgene shares rose $5.00, or 5.2 percent, to $98.73 on Nasdaq.

113,CELG,Celgene says 2015 off to strong start; key growth drivers in place,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) on Thursday said early first quarter sales trends indicate the year is off to a strong start, and that it has growth drivers in place to meet or exceed its 2015 and long- term forecasts. Earlier this month, the U.S. biotechnology company issued a 2020 forecast that called for revenue to exceed $20 billion, up from $7.56 billion in 2014. On a conference call with analysts on Thursday, Celgene said it expects $17 billion of that to come from existing products, such as its flagship multiple myeloma drug Revlimid and Abraxane for breast, lung and pancreatic cancer. The remaining sales would come from label expansions of current medicines and six new product introductions, such as a high profile treatment for Crohn’s disease. The company noted that not all the new programs have to be successful to reach that $3 billion sales target. “We are confident that key growth drivers exist to meet or exceed 2015 and longer term forecasts,” Chief Operating Officer Mark Alles said.  Jackie Fouse, head of hematology and oncology, said Abraxane was becoming the standard of care for pancreatic cancer in the United States. Combinations of Abraxane with a variety of highly promising new drugs that spur the immune system to fight cancer, currently being tested, were not included in any sales forecasts, said Fouse. “That’s upside potential that we have.” Celgene is awaiting U.S. and European approvals this year for use of Revlimid for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients rather than just after prior treatment has failed, which should help increase sales. In addition, Fouse said the company has received reimbursement approval for Revlimid in Russia and anticipates  pricing approval in Mexico. The company also expressed confidence that its newer multiple myeloma drug, Pomalyst, would become a multibillion-dollar drug. Celgene targeted 2017 sales of $1.5 billion, up from 2014 sales of $690 million. Celgene posted $47 million in fourth quarter sales of Otezla, its new drug for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis, and said new prescriptions accelerated significantly since the September U.S. psoriasis approval. The company is looking at Otezla launches in U.K., Germany and Nordic countries in early 2015, followed by launches in other European markets the same year. It is eyeing an approval in Japan in 2016.

116,CELG,FDA approves new use for Celgene's cancer drug Revlimid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has expanded the authorized use of Celgene Corp’s cancer drug Revlimid to include newly diagnosed patients with multiple myeloma, the company said on Wednesday. Previously the drug was only approved for patients who had received at least one previous therapy. Physicians in the United States have long been prescribing Revlimid for new patients on an “off-label” basis, but the company had not been allowed to promote its use in this population. The FDA’s action means Celgene can market Revlimid, in combination with a different drug, dexamethasone, as a treatment for all multiple myeloma patients and helps validate the company’s premise that treating patients earlier and for a longer period of time increases progression-free survival. The approval is expected to only modestly increase sales in the United States since doctors are already prescribing the drug for newly diagnosed patients. In Europe, where physicians are not allowed to prescribe off-label, the situation is different. Celgene expects European regulators to also approve the drug for newly-diagnosed patients within the next few weeks. If they do, the move could add meaningfully to sales. About 50 percent of patients with multiple myeloma are newly diagnosed. The remainder have received one or more prior therapies. Revlimid generated total sales in 2014 of $2.92 billion in the United States and $2.06 billion in the rest of the world. The drug is approved in 70 countries for previously treated patients. The company hopes approvals in the U.S. and Europe will pave the way for other countries to also approve the drug for newly diagnosed patients. John Newman, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said in a research note that he expects sales of Revlimid to reach $10 billion by 2020. About 93,600 patients are living with multiple myeloma in Europe and about 88,499 patients are living with it in the United States, Celgene said. Revlimid is also approved in the United States and some other countries for a group of blood disorders known as myelodysplastic syndromes. It is also approved in the United States for patients with mantle cell lymphoma whose disease has progressed after two prior therapies. Celgene’s shares were up 1.4 percent to $117.96 in Wednesday morning trade on Nasdaq.

Revlimid generated total sales in 2014 of $2.92 billion in the United States and $2.06 billion in the rest of the world. The drug is approved in 70 countries for previously treated patients. The company hopes approvals in the U.S. and Europe will pave the way for other countries to also approve the drug for newly diagnosed patients. John Newman, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, said in a research note that he expects sales of Revlimid to reach $10 billion by 2020. About 93,600 patients are living with multiple myeloma in Europe and about 88,499 patients are living with it in the United States, Celgene said. Revlimid is also approved in the United States and some other countries for a group of blood disorders known as myelodysplastic syndromes. It is also approved in the United States for patients with mantle cell lymphoma whose disease has progressed after two prior therapies. Celgene’s shares were up 1.4 percent to $117.96 in Wednesday morning trade on Nasdaq.

The drugmaker, which saw off a $118 billion bid by Pfizer  last year, said on Friday its sales fell by a slightly less than expected 6 percent to $6.06 billion in the first quarter, hurt by Nexium generics and the strong dollar, its reporting currency. Core earnings per share, which exclude certain items, fell 7 percent but came in 1 cent above forecasts at $1.08. The results were helped by the partial sell-off of a number of drugs, leaving some investors sceptical and the shares fell 2 percent by 0805 GMT. Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said its new cancer alliance with Celgene would maximise the potential of immune system-boosting drugs in blood cancers and a tie-up with Innate Pharma would further strengthen immuno-oncology. AstraZeneca will get an upfront payment of $450 million from Celgene by giving it the right to work with MEDI4736, a so-called anti-PD-L1 immune system medicine, in blood cancers. Innate will receive an initial $250 million from AstraZeneca. Despite the loss of sales on profitable old drugs like Nexium and Crestor for cholesterol, which loses U.S. patent protection next year, AstraZeneca argues new cancer drugs can help lift sales to $45 billion in 2023 from 2014’s $26 billion. Analysts view the forecast as a stretch, although confidence is building in its immuno-oncology portfolio, with the next focus being updates at the May 29-June 2 American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. AstraZeneca now has 72 oncology trials under way, including 31 in immuno-oncology. In the short-term, Soriot has his work cut out to hit 2015 financial targets and the Celgene deal highlights a drive to gain revenue by “externalisation”, or selling rights to some research, which generated $309 million in the quarter. “Quarterly results confirm that this ‘engineering’ is needed if management is to hit its full-year EPS targets,” Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a note. The group reiterated its forecast of a low single-digit percent increase in 2015 core earnings at constant exchange rates, despite a mid single-digit percent fall in sales. Industry analysts had on average forecast first-quarter group sales of $5.98 billion and earnings of $1.07 cents, according to Thomson Reuters.

Upbeat economic reports added to uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates, a day after data showed the U.S. economy had slowed to a crawl in the first quarter and the Federal Reserve pointed to weakness in the labor market and other areas of the U.S. economy. Despite the day’s decline, all three major indexes posted slight gains for April. The Nasdaq biotech index dropped 3.1 percent on Thursday, led by a 4.5 percent fall in Celgene, which reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. The decline marked a fifth day of losses for the biotech index, which was down 8.1 percent for the week so far. The Nasdaq fell for a fourth straight day, and was off 3 percent from Friday’s record closing high. The S&P; tech index  slid 1.6 percent, the day’s worst-performing sector, while small-cap stocks also underperformed. The Russell 2000 small-cap index was down 2.2 percent. Apple, down 2.7 percent at $125.15, was the biggest drag on the three major indexes. The company limited the availability of the Apple Watch after a key component was found to be defective, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Biotechs and tech were leaders and now they’ve reversed,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. “Earnings don’t really support the valuations at this time, and I think the market needs to correct a bit.

127,CELG,Celgene sales highlight Revlimid dependence ahead of patent ruling,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp’s dependence on its big-selling multiple myeloma drug Revlimid raised investor concerns on Thursday as sales of its other medicines fell short of expectations. Celgene shares fell 5 percent after the company reported quarterly results in which Revlimid shored up profits. Industry analysts see room for Revlimid to grow much further, with some estimating the drug will nearly double annual sales in coming years.  But investors may be hesitating as Celgene faces a legal challenge that could cut its exclusive sales rights in Europe by a year or two. The European Patent Office hearing on a Revlimid patent that runs through 2024 is set for May 7. “Nobody seems to want to buy the stock in front of May 7,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. “Once we get past that, I think the stock rebounds.” Revlimid sales of $1.34 billion in the first quarter were in line with expectations and especially strong in the United States. Sales of the cancer drug Abraxane, and newer medicines Pomalyst for multiple myeloma and Otezla for psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis all fell short of forecasts. Inventory stocking, higher co-pays and demands by payers for larger Otezla rebates contributed to first quarter weakness, analysts said. The New Jersey-based company said it now sees 2015 Revlimid sales at or above $5.7 billion, the high end of its prior forecast range. The drug accounts for about 60 percent of Celgene revenue. Patients are using the treatment longer to keep their cancer at bay, the company said. In addition, U.S. and European regulators recently expanded approvals to allow its use in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients, which will drive growth.      Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Mara Goldstein forecast Revlimid sales reaching $10 billion by 2020 if its duration of use and geographic expansion continues to grow, along with approvals or new uses.  “It’s a high class problem to have,” she said of the company’s dependence on Revlimid. She predicts Revlimid will decline as a percentage of profit “not because it’s declining, but because other products are growing. That’s a very positive dynamic.”  Celgene said it anticipates “significant market share gains over coming months and years” with reimbursements for newly diagnosed patients in Europe, and with an expected approval in Japan for such patients around the end of the year. The company is also conducting five late-stage trials of Revlimid in a variety of lymphomas. “It’s always less risky to expand the opportunities for an existing drug than to invest in advancing a new drug,”  Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said. “They happen to have a great drug that still has a lot of runway in front of it.” Investors still have high hopes for future blockbuster sales of Celgene’s experimental drug for Crohn’s disease. The company is also collaborating with AstraZeneca to test Abraxane and other Celgene products in combination with experimental Astra drugs that spur the immune system to fight cancer. Such partnerships “suggest there’s going to be a huge range of revenue opportunities for them five to 10 years from now,” Porges said.

Economic data is still going to be a bit mixed in the near term and that can be used as a crutch for the markets.” At 12:05 p.m. EDT (1605 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 82.97 points, or 0.46 percent, at 17,952.56, the S&P; 500 was down 10.62 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,096.23 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 43.55 points, or 0.87 percent, at 4,980.10. Celgene fell 4.1 percent to $108.51 and was the biggest drag on the biotech index after the company blamed the dollar for its lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. The stock was the second biggest drag on the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq. Baidu declined 6.8 percent to $204.03 after China’s dominant Internet search engine provider posted its slowest quarterly revenue growth rate in almost seven years. “The tech sector is a very “risk-on” sector and is the sector most sensitive to perceived rate hikes, so you’re seeing some reshuffling in portfolios,” said Brian Fenske, head of sales trading at ITG in New York. Google, IBM and Intel were all down between 1.0 to 1.5 percent. Yelp shares slumped as much as 22 percent to a near two-year low of $40.04 a day after the operator of consumer review website forecast second-quarter revenue below analysts’ expectations. Colgate-Palmolive slipped 2.4 percent to $66.85 after cutting its full-year profit forecast for the second time, saying the impact of the dollar would worsen. Earnings expected after the close on Thursday include Dow component Visa, insurer AIG and LinkedIn. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,231 to 698, for a 3.20-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,948 issues fell and 704 advanced for a 2.77-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

All the 10 major S&P; sectors were down, with the technology index retreating 1.1 percent. The Nasdaq biotech index  dropped 1.7 percent. Apple fell 2.3 percent to $125.70 and was the biggest drag on the Dow, S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq. The company limited availability of the Apple Watch after a key component supplied by a Chinese company was found to be defective, according to the Wall Street Journal. Equity markets were weak despite the release of encouraging economic data earlier in the day. The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits tumbled to a 15-year low last week and consumer spending rose in March, signs the economy was regaining momentum after stumbling badly in the first quarter. “I think we’re going to see cleaner data come out in the second quarter and with the jobless claims being at their lowest levels in 15 years, that certainly points towards a strengthening labor market which has been a clear focus point of the Fed,” said Mark Luschini, chief market strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. At 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 123.88 points, or 0.69 percent, at 17,911.65, the S&P; 500 was down 14.73 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,092.12 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 47.89 points, or 0.95 percent, at 4,975.75. Celgene fell 3.4 percent to $109.39 and was the biggest drag on biotech stocks after the biotechnology company blamed the dollar for its lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. The stock was the second biggest drag on the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq. Baidu declined 5.9 percent to $206 after China’s dominant Internet search engine provider posted its slowest quarterly revenue growth rate in almost seven years. Companies continue to cite the strong dollar, which has climbed nearly 9 percent against a basket of major currencies from January to March, for weak results and forecasts. Colgate-Palmolive fell 1.9 percent to $67.17 after cutting its full-year profit forecast for the second time, saying the impact of the dollar would worsen. Automotive supplier BorgWarner also cited the dollar for a fall in quarterly revenue. Its stock dropped 4.2 percent to $58.35. ConocoPhillips fell 0.62 percent to $67.94 after it reported a sharp fall in quarterly profit, hurt by a steep decline in crude oil prices. Yelp shares slumped 18.1 percent to $42.00 a day after the operator of consumer review website forecast second-quarter revenue below analysts’ expectations.

135,CELG,CORRECTED-Rich Synageva M&A; premium epitomizes appetite for orphan drugs,"(In paragraph 7 corrects spelling of analyst’s name to Liisa Bayko from Lisa Bayko) By Olivia Oran May 6 (Reuters) - The hefty premium Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc has agreed to pay to acquire Synageva BioPharma Corp highlights how the popularity of so-called orphan drug makers is leading to valuations many investors now deem frothy. Alexion shares fell as much as 10 percent on Wednesday on investor concerns the $8.4 billion cash and stock deal overvalued Synageva, whose drug for a rare and potentially fatal condition that causes a build-up of fat in the blood and liver awaits regulatory approval. Alexion offered Synageva nearly a 140 percent premium, versus an average takeover premium of 41 percent for biotechnology companies so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Other recent big deals involving orphan drug makers that focus on rare diseases include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s $3.5 billion purchase of Auspex Pharmaceuticals announced in March and Shire Plc’s acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals for $5.2 billion in January. Reuters also reported last week that Pfizer Inc had made a preliminary offer for rare-disease drug maker Swedish Orphan Biovitrium AB. Orphan drug companies are seen as attractive because they can typically charge higher prices for their drugs, which serve small patient populations. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval process for these drugs is also often quicker - around 10 months versus at least 1 year for non-orphan drugs. This is because these drugs treat serious or life threatening diseases when other treatment options may not exist. “Rare-disease companies are profitable businesses and the cost to market a product is pretty low, which makes them attractive targets,” said Liisa Bayko, an analyst with JMP Securities. “The drugs seem to sell themselves to some degree.” In turn, major drug companies such as Pfizer, Celgene Corp  and Novartis AG are investing heavily in orphan drugs. While rare diseases were historically ignored by large pharmaceutical companies in favor of those with larger patient populations such as cardiac disease and diabetes, orphan made up almost half of the 41 new drugs approved by the FDA last year. Sales of orphan drugs are expected to grow at an annual rate of almost 11 percent per year through 2020, compared with 4 percent for drugs treating larger populations, according to a recent report from research firm EvaluatePharma. However, some experts argue that orphan drug companies do not necessarily make for the best investments, because they are overvalued by the market and may carry R&D; risk. “When you have large pharmaceutical companies that aren’t already in the orphan sector paying large premiums, it enters into really risky territory,” said Steve Brozak, president of WBB Securities LLC. “It’s going to be problematic for companies and investors that don’t understand all the processes of manufacturing, development and patient advocacy.” U.S. pharmaceutical merger activity has topped $107.3 billion so far this year, more than double the volume a year ago.

136,CELG,EU patent office revokes Celgene Revlimid patent; appeal planned,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp on Thursday said the European Patent Office revoked a key patent on the company’s flagship multiple myeloma drug Revlimid, a move that could shave a year or two from the medicine’s exclusivity in Europe. The so-called polymorph patent in question would have kept cheaper versions of Revlimid off the European market until September 2024. The New Jersey-based biotechnology company said it plans to  appeal the ruling, a process that could take at least three years to run its course.  “While this would remain under appeal, the patent remains valid and enforceable during that time,” said Celgene spokesman Greg Geissman. Other Revlimid patents provide Celgene with protection in Europe through 2022 or 2023.  “The worst-case scenario in the EU for Celgene would be generic entry in July 2022, after the expiration of their composition of matter patent,” Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note, adding that the appeals process could take as long as five years. A similar patent challenge is under way in the United States. But due to differences in U.S. patent law, both the company and analysts have said the European ruling is highly unlikely to be a predictor of the outcome in the world’s largest market. Revlimid, which had worldwide sales of $1.34 billion in the first quarter, accounts for about 60 percent of total Celgene revenue.  Celgene shares were up $2.8 percent at $111.66 on Nasdaq.

139,CELG,Celgene to invest $1 billion in Juno to partner in cancer therapies,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp on Monday launched a 10-year partnership with Juno Therapeutics, announcing a $1 billion investment aimed at bringing to market Juno technologies that harness the immune system to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. The biotech companies, in a conference call to discuss the multi-faceted deal, said they anticipate potential product approvals in 2020. The huge vote of confidence propelled Juno’s shares more than 40 percent higher to $65.75 in heavy extended trading.       Celgene will pay Juno about $150 million upfront and buy about 9.1 million newly issued Juno shares at $93 each,  double Juno’s closing price on Monday. Juno had about 90.4 million shares outstanding as of May 4, according to a regulatory filing. At the heart of the deal are new treatments that use  Chimeric Antigen Receptor Technology (CAR-T) and T Cell Receptor (TCR) technologies, red-hot areas of immunotherapy that have driven up the share prices of several small companies, such as Juno, Kite Pharma Inc and Bluebird Bio Inc.  “Juno has the best-in-class CAR-T and T cell receptors,” Celgene Chief Executive Bob Hugin said.   Celgene, which said it does not expect deal costs to affect near-term profit and loss, will have the option to buy up to 30 percent of Juno’s common stock between the ninth and 10th year of the collaboration, provided it exercises an option to raise its stake to 19.9 percent between years four and five. “Celgene is making a big commitment to CAR-T as we think this will be an important hematological platform,” RBC Capital Partners analyst Michael Yee wrote in a note. Each company will also have options to partner on certain drugs in the other’s pipeline, with the upfront costs dependent upon how far along those assets are in development. The harnessing of T cells and other components of the immune system to attack tumors can have dramatic, long-lasting effects on advanced cancers, potentially transforming the $100 billion global oncology drug market. T-cell receptors (TCRs) are a class of compounds that make it easier for the immune cells to identify and destroy cancer cells. CAR-T cells actually take the immune cells and modify them into more potent cancer killers. Kite and Bluebird said this month that they would partner to develop and market a new class of T-cell therapies for HPV-associated cancers. Kite shares rose more than 8 percent in extended trading after the Juno deal was announced.

143,CELG,Celgene to buy Receptos for $7.2 billion; gains promising drug,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp said on Tuesday it would buy Receptos Inc for $7.2 billion in a move that will give the U.S. biotechnology company a potential multibillion-dollar drug in late stage development for inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis. Celgene, whose shares rose nearly 6 percent in extended trading to $130.15, said it would pay $232 per share in cash for the smaller biotech. Receptos shares closed at $207.18 on Nasdaq and rose to $228.14 after hours. Celgene has been on something of a deal spree in recent months. The Receptos move comes just two weeks after Celgene said it would invest $1 billion in Juno Therapeutics to gain access to its cancer immunotherapy portfolio in a deal that would allow Celgene to buy up to 30 percent of Juno over the next decade. The company also has collaborations with Agios Pharmaceuticals, which has a very promising leukemia drug in development as well as other oncology prospects, and with AstraZeneca in immuno-oncology. “We have been fortunate to have been able to act on several major transactions that position us for sustained and enhanced long-term growth,” Celgene Chief Executive Bob Hugin said on a conference call.     “The Receptos acquisition provides a transformational opportunity for Celgene to impact multiple therapeutic areas,”  Hugin said. The deal should give Celgene lucrative new revenue sources, accelerating earning growth beginning in 2019, Hugin said, adding that “it will be a key driver of growth well beyond 2020.” The acquisition is expected to cut into Celgene earnings in 2016 and 2017 and be neutral in 2018, the company said. “They found a very largely derisked late stage asset that can really move the needle,” said Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt. “And they didn’t seemingly overpay, so it’s a pretty good deal.”  Receptos in April reported positive data in ulcerative colitis from a midstage trial of its experimental oral drug ozanimod, the medicine at the heart of the Celgene deal. Phase III ozanimod trials are underway for both ulcerative colitis and relapsing MS. The drug could be approved for MS in 2018, Celgene said, putting the company into a new therapeutic area. Phase III colitis data are expected in 2018. Celgene forecast peak annual ozanimod sales of $4 billion to $6 billion for UC and MS. The drug also has potential use in Crohn’s disease, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, Celgene said. Those are all conditions with very large patient populations. Given its confidence in ozanimod, Celgene raised its 2020 financial targets. It now expects product sales to exceed $21 billion and adjusted earnings to exceed $13 per share, up from prior 2020 forecasts of sales greater than $20 billion and earnings of $12.50 per share. Celgene also reported preliminary second quarter results and updated its full-year forecast. It now expects 2015 adjusted earnings of $4.75 to $4.85 per share, up from its previous range of $4.60 to $4.75. It still sees 2015 product sales of $9 billion to $9.5 billion. For the second quarter, Celgene reported revenue of $2.28 billion, up 22 percent from the year-ago quarter. It said it expected to report net earnings of 43 cents per share, down from 72 cents a year ago, due to expenses for collaboration payments. It said adjusted earnings would be about $1.23 per share, up from 90 cents a year ago and above Wall Street expectations of $1.14. J.P.

146,CELG,Wall Street edges lower as energy weighs,"(Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower on Wednesday following comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, as a decline in energy shares outweighed gains in the financial sector in the latter stages of trading.  The energy sector .SPNY, down 1.6 percent, was the worst performer of the 10 major S&P; groups as oil prices retreated on concerns increased exports from Iran will add to a global supply glut. Brent LCOc1 settled down $1.46 at $57.05 while U.S. crude CLc1 settled down $1.63 at $51.41 a barrel. “We were positive the whole day and we sort of lost our gains right at the tail end,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York.  “If crude were to be going down, that would mean there is an assumption this deal may get through Congress or the President’s veto won’t get overturned by Congress such that this Iranian flood of crude comes onto the market.” Financials .SPSY, up 0.7 percent, helped curb declines. The group was buoyed by a 3.2 percent rise in Bank of America (BAC.N) to $17.68 and a 3.8 percent gain in U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) to $45.53 after their quarterly results. The S&P; snapped a four-session winning streak, its longest run of gains since January.  Celgene (CELG.O) climbed 7 percent to $131.39 after touching a record high of $135.98. The company said it would buy Receptos RCPT.O to get a potential multibillion-dollar drug. Yellen said she expects the economy to grow steadily for the rest of the year, allowing the Fed to hike rates, but gave no direct hint on the timing or pace of a hike. The Fed is broadly expected to hike rates in September or December. The Fed’s Beige Book showed U.S. economic activity continued to expand from mid-May through June, with lower energy prices helping boost consumer spending but remaining a drag on manufacturing.

The owner of Pizza Hut and KFC reported its fourth straight quarter of falling sales, indicating it is still struggling to regain lost ground in China after a food safety scandal last year. The Nasdaq is likely to get a lift on Thursday on the heels of results from Intel (INTC.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) after the market close. Intel jumped 5.4 percent to $31.30 while Netflix surged 10.4 percent to $108.20 in extended trade, sending Nasdaq e-mini NQc1 futures up nearly 20 points.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,841 to 1,223, for a 1.51-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,826 issues fell and 998 advanced for a 1.83-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.

147,CELG,Wall Street lauds Celgene's $7.2 billion Receptos buy,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp’s (CELG.O) effort to reduce dependence on its flagship cancer drug through the $7.2 billion bet on Receptos Inc’s RCPT.O potential blockbuster drug won the backing of Wall Street.         Shares of Celgene and Receptos rose as much as 11 percent to record highs on Wednesday. Cowen & Co’s Eric Schmidt said the deal could be a “steal” for Celgene, if Receptos’ ozinamod proves successful, while Baird Equity Research’s Brian Skorney drew parallels to Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) acquisition of Pharmasset Inc in 2011. Gilead spent $11 billion to buy Pharmasset and its portfolio of experimental hepatitis C treatments, which now command a sizable portion of the U.S. market under the brands Sovaldi and Harvoni. Celgene’s offer to buy Receptos comes just under three weeks after it said it would invest $1 billion in Juno Therapeutics Inc JUNO.O, which is developing cancer treatments that belong to a new class of therapies. Healthcare sector has seen a record wave of deal-making since the start of 2014, stretching from large drugmakers buying up smaller rivals to consolidation among makers of generic medicines and tie-ups between insurers. Buying Receptos gives Celgene access to ozinamod, a product that it estimates to have peak annual sales of $4-$6 billion in treating ulcerative colitis and multiple sclerosis. Celgene’s Revlimid had worldwide sales of $1.34 billion in the first quarter.  Celgene receives about 60 percent of revenue from Revlimid but the multiple myeloma drug’s patents have been challenged in United States and Europe. Tuesday’s deal dilutes concerns over potential generic threat to the cancer treatment, analysts wrote. “We like the fact that ozinamod is a largely derisked asset with large commercial potential that is capable of augmenting longer-term growth...,” Schmidt wrote. Barclays Capital’s Geoff Meacham called the deal price “fair,” with Nomura analysts adding that the price represented a steep discount relative to recent deals. Celgene shares rose to $135.98 while Receptos rose to $229.44. ",7152015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-receptos-m-a/wall-street-lauds-celgenes-7-2-billion-receptos-buy-idUSKCN0PP26H20150715
148,CELG,US STOCKS-Wall St higher; financial stocks lead,"* Turmoil abroad unlikely to hit U.S. economy - Yellen * Nasdaq biotech index hits record high on Celgene deal * Bank of America rises after profit more than doubles * Macy’s rises after Starboard announces stake * Indexes up: Dow 0.07 pct, S&P; 0.09 pct, Nasdaq 0.16 pct   (Updates to early afternoon) By Tanya Agrawal July 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were marginally higher in afternoon trading on Wednesday, set for a fifth straight day of gains, after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the turmoil abroad was unlikely to affect the U.S. economy and that the Fed was on track to raise interest rates this year. Bank of America rose 3 percent to $17.66, poised for its best day in five months, after reporting its biggest quarterly profit in nearly four years. The stock was the biggest boost to the S&P; 500 financial index, which was the top gainer among the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors. Celgene jumped as much as 10.7 percent to a record high of $135.98 after the company said it would buy Receptos  to get a potential multibillion-dollar drug. Celgene’s gains helped push the Nasdaq biotech index to hit a record high for the third time in three weeks. Yellen said she expects the economy to grow steadily for the rest of the year, allowing the Fed to hike rates, but gave no direct hint on the timing or pace of a hike. The Fed is broadly expected to hike rates in September or December. “A rate hike will be additive to the U.S. equities as the U.S. economy requires something other than crisis-era rates,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. “The pace of the rate hike is more important than the timing of it as investors remain in pause mode with a modest downward basis.” At 12:43 p.m. ET (1643 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 11.95 points, or 0.07 percent, at 18,065.53 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 8.24 points, or 0.16 percent, at 5,113.13. The S&P; 500 was up 1.94 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,110.89, just 1 percent away from its May record high of $2134.72. Five of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with the energy index’s 0.97 percent fall leading the decliners. Oil prices fell as traders took profits from the past two days of gains. Corporate America is expected to report its worst sales decline in nearly six years in the second quarter, while profit is expected to have fallen 2.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters estimates. The effect of the uncertainty in the Chinese markets and the strong dollar will also be in focus. Yum Brands fell 2.9 percent to $89.37 after the owner of Pizza Hut and KFC reported its fourth straight quarter of falling sales, indicating it is still struggling to regain lost ground in China after a food scandal last year. Macy’s jumped as much as 7 percent to $71.35 after investment firm Starboard Value said it had taken a stake in the retail chain. Netflix was down 1.6 percent at $98.71 in its first day of trade after a seven-for-one stock split. Netflix and Intel are scheduled to report after the markets close. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,756 to 1,195. On the Nasdaq, 1,615 issues fell and 1,077 advanced. The S&P; 500 index posted 27 new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 121 new highs and 41 new lows.

152,CELG,Celgene says patent-fighting hedge fund manager wants to short its shares,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Celgene Corp, one of the world’s largest biotechnology companies, has accused U.S. hedge fund manager Kyle Bass of attempting to profit from his attempts to wipe out several major drug patents through his Coalition for Affordable Drugs. The company asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on Tuesday to sanction Bass and others behind the group by throwing out its challenges to Celgene’s patents. The industry is watching the sanctions attempt closely because it could doom Bass’ much-publicized effort to kill what he calls undeserving patents and to lower drug prices. Celgene said Bass’ real motive was to make money short-selling pharmaceutical shares that drop when a patent review is filed. Bass and his partners want “to line their own pockets at the expense of public pharmaceutical companies and their shareholders,” Celgene said in legal papers. Neither Bass nor a spokeswoman for his $2 billion Dallas-based Hayman Capital Management was immediately available for comment on Wednesday. In February, Bass began to file reviews to eliminate drug patents through a procedure called inter partes review. Since then, the coalition has filed 16 of them, including five against Celgene. Drug companies are worried because the reviews, which began in 2012 as part of the America Invents Act, are cancelling patents at a high rate. They have lobbied Congress to prevent hedge funds from launching reviews. Bass has said big companies were improperly extending patent protection in questionable ways, such as changing dosage or packaging, to keep drug prices high. But New Jersey-based Celgene said Bass was not trying to help the public by lowering prices, citing media reports of his short-selling strategy. It said his partner was Erich Spangenberg, whom the company called a “patent troll” and had already threatened to file reviews on Celgene’s patents in 2014. Bass’ first review, on Feb. 10 against an Acorda Therapeutics patent on the Ampyra multiple sclerosis drug, led to a nearly 10 percent drop in the company’s stock price. Celgene’s patents cover methods to ensure that thalidomide and related cancer drugs, which can cause severe birth defects, are only given to approved patients who are not pregnant.

155,CELG,"U.S. oncology group rates blood cancer regimens, including cost","Oct 16 (Reuters) - The most influential source for U.S. oncology treatment guidelines on Friday unveiled ratings aimed at helping doctors and patients assess the costs versus benefits of current therapies for two types of blood cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), a nonprofit alliance of 26 leading cancer centers, said its new “Evidence Blocks” for multiple myeloma and chronic myelogenous leukemia are the first in a series that by the end of next year will encompass all oncology therapies, other than surgery or radiation. The blocks give each therapy a score of between one and five in five categories: efficacy, safety, quality and consistency of evidence and affordability. They will supplement NCCN’s widely followed guidelines for oncology care. In examples released on Friday, NCCN rated primary treatments for CML: Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Sprycel, and Novartis AG’s Gleevec and Tasigna. Ratings for all three were nearly identical: highly effective and very expensive. For newly diagnosed myeloma patients eligible for a stem cell transplant, NCCN lists six “preferred” regimens, four of which contain Takeda Pharmaceutical Co’s Velcade and various chemotherapies, one that includes Celgene Corp’s  Revlimid and another that combines Velcade and Revlimid. The Velcade/Revlimid/dexamethasone regimen is rated as the most effective and the most expensive. NCCN lists Amgen Inc’s Kyprolis, in combination with Revlimid and dexamethasone, as another upfront therapy for myeloma. The Kyprolis regimen was rated highly effective, mildly toxic, average in terms of evidence, mainly consistent in terms of trial data, and very expensive. Multiple myeloma is a type of blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow, while CML starts in certain blood-forming cells of the bone marrow. Multiple myeloma is diagnosed in about 27,000 Americans each year, and CML is occurs in about 7,000, according to the American Cancer Society.

156,CELG,Celgene's revenue misses as key cancer drug sales slow,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) posted its smallest revenue growth in five quarters due to slower sales of its two key cancer drugs.  The drugmaker’s shares fell as much as 6.7 percent to $118.61, wiping out $6.77 billion from the company’s market value. Lower-than-expected sales growth of Revlimid and Abraxane pushed the company’s revenue below the average analyst estimate and profit to just above expectations.  “Notably, this goes against the trend in large-cap biotech, where the vast majority of companies beat on the top or bottom line and raised guidance,” Barclay’s analyst Geoffrey Meacham said in a note.     Growing sales of expensive new cancer drugs and other treatments helped top U.S. drugmakers such as Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Merck & Co (MRK.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) post stronger-than-expected quarterly profits last month. Celgene’s total revenue rose 17.7 percent to $2.33 billion in the third quarter, but still fell short of the average analyst estimate of $2.40 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revlimid sales grew 11.8 percent to $1.45 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, slower than the 15 percent sales growth it registered in each of the last four quarters. “Revlimid appears to suffer a bit from adverse seasonality, and possibly also (foreign exchange) in ex-US geographies,” Cowen and Co analysts wrote in a note. The drug’s international sales rose 3.4 percent to $558.3 million, which analysts said were below their expectations. Celgene cut its full-year sales forecast for Abraxane to a range of $950 million-$1.25 billion, down from $1.00 billion-$1.25 billion three months ago.     Jackie Fouse, Celgene’s president of hematology and oncology unit, said Abraxane was facing competition in the United States from newer treatments for lung cancer. Celgene posted net loss of $34.1 million, or 4 cents per share in the quarter, compared with a net profit of $508.5 million, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier. Net loss for the quarter included $751.8 million in collaboration costs and $231.6 million in costs related to the company’s acquisition of Receptos Inc announced in July.

159,CELG,FDA approves new Bristol-Myers treatment for multiple myeloma,"Nov 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Monday it had approved a drug to be sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co as a treatment for a form of blood cancer. The FDA said it approved the treatment, Empliciti, to be used in multiple myeloma patients in combination with Celgene Corp's Revlimid and common anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone. (1.usa.gov/1lpWQEo) The National Cancer Institute estimates there will be 26,850 new cases of multiple myeloma and 11,240 related deaths in the United States in 2015. Research has shown that combination treatments increase the time that multiple myeloma patients survive without the disease. The FDA said that Empliciti is the second immuno-oncology treatment for multiple myeloma to be approved, after Johnson & Johnson’s Darzalex. Bristol-Myers and AbbVie Inc co-developed the drug, but Empliciti will be sold only by Bristol-Myers. The company is considered the leader among drugmakers racing to develop a new wave of cancer treatments that harness the immune system, including its recently approved immuno-oncology product Opdivo. Opdivo was approved in December for advanced melanoma and was approved in March to treat the less-common squamous type of non-small cell lung cancer. Sales of Opdivo reached $305 million the latest quarter, putting it on track to become a blockbuster product.

160,CELG,Celgene settles U.S. patent litigation for top seller Revlimid,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp said it would allow for the sale of a generic version of its flagship multiple myeloma drug, Revlimid, in the United States over a year before patents covering the drug expire. The company said it would provide India-based Natco Pharma Ltd and its U.S. partner, Arrow International Limited,  a unit of Allergan Plc, the license to Celgene’s patents required to manufacture and market an unlimited quantity of generic Revlimid beginning Jan. 31, 2026 as part of a patent litigation settlement. Patents covering Revlimid in the United States expire in April 2027.

165,CELG,UPDATE 2-Celgene's profit misses estimates as costs rise,"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Celgene Corp’s (CELG.O) quarterly profit missed estimates as research and development costs surged and sales growth of its blockbuster cancer drug, Revlimid, slowed further. The company’s shares fell about 5 percent Thursday morning, a day when most biotech stocks drifted lower. The broader Nasdaq biotech industry .NBI was down 2 percent. Revlimid sales rose about 8 percent in the fourth quarter from the third quarter. They rose 12 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter. The U.S. biotechnology company, however, assured investors about the long-term prospects of Revlimid, saying the drug will likely gain approval for new indications and reach new markets as more trial data comes in. Sales of the multiple myeloma drug came in at $1.56 billion - in line with consensus estimates - accounting for about 61 percent of the company’s total revenue in the quarter ended Dec. 31. The company said the drug is expected to generate sales of $6.6 billion-$6.7 billion in 2016, roughly in line with Wall Street expectations. Celgene has been spending heavily to expand Revlimid’s use and geographical reach as well as to develop other drugs. For the fourth quarter, Celgene’s adjusted R&D; expenses jumped about 36 percent to $649 million, including a $70 million milestone payment for OncoMed Pharmaceuticals Inc (OMED.O). The company, which bought Receptos Inc last year to gain access to its inflammatory bowel disease drug, on Thursday forecast first-quarter adjusted profit of $1.27-$1.30 per share. Wall Street analysts were expecting the company to earn $1.30 per share on average. Celgene’s net profit fell to $561 million, or 69 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $613.9 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.18 per share, underwhelming the average analyst estimate of $1.22, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s revenue rose about 23 percent to $2.56 billion in the quarter. Analysts were expecting revenue of about $2.54 billion.  The company stuck to its 2016 earnings and revenue forecast it issued earlier in January, which was slightly below analysts’ expectations. Chief Executive Bob Hugin said earlier this month he would step down as of March 1 and hand over the reins to President and Chief Operating Officer Mark Alles.

Celgene, which specializes in treatments for a blood plasma cell cancer called myeloma, could see double-digit growth for its Revlimid drug for years to come, with significant growth potential from overseas, Barron’s said.  Despite negative publicity related to high prices on its hepatitis-C drugs, Gilead Sciences’ products often cure patients within months, the publication said. “That word, cure, isn’t used often enough by Big Pharma,” Barron’s said.

175,CELG,"J&J; myeloma drug, in combo regimen, delays worsening of the disease","(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s therapy for advanced multiple myeloma sharply reduced the risk of disease progression when taken with two standard treatments for the blood cancer, according to research the company hopes will pave the way for wider use of the treatment. The drug, Darzalex, received U.S. approval in November for use by itself among patients who had received at least three prior treatments for myeloma, a cancer of infection-fighting white blood cells.  Data from a late-stage trial involving 498 patients who had previously undergone one or more myeloma treatments was released on Sunday. In the study, one group received Takeda Pharmaceutical Co’s Velcade and the steroid dexamethasone, while the other group received Darzalex in combination with those two drugs.  After more than seven months, 61 percent fewer patients taking the Darzalex combination experienced a worsening of their disease compared with those taking the standard two-drug regimen, meeting the trial’s main goal. The median time to progression of disease has not yet been reached for the Darzalex group, compared with 7.2 months for patients taking the two-drug combo. The study was stopped in March after an independent data monitoring committee found the Darzalex regimen showed a statistically significant benefit. Some 19 percent of patients in the Darzalex group showed no further sign of disease, versus 9 percent of those taking  Velcade and dexamethasone. Significant disease reduction was seen in 83 percent taking the Darzalex regimen, versus 63 percent in the two-drug combination. The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in Chicago. The infused medicine, which has a list price of $135,000 for the first full year of treatment, blocks the CD38 protein found on myeloma cells. It was approved based on favorable data from two smaller trials, including a study in which tumors shrank in 29 percent of patients. Dr. Antonio Palumbo, the study’s lead researcher, said in an interview that overall toxicity in the Darzalex regimen was similar to that seen with the two standard treatments. That may help the J&J; drug become a second-line treatment, in combination with Velcade and dexamethasone, he said. The most common side effects for both drug combinations included low blood platelets, diarrhea and anemia.   Palumbo, melanoma unit chief at the University of Torino, Italy, said data from another late-stage study of Darzalex is expected later this month and will probably mirror strong results seen in his own study. In that trial, patients received Darzalex in combination with Celgene Corp’s leading Revlimid (lenalidomide) treatment and with dexamethasone. Mark Wildgust, global head of hematology at J&J;, said the company hopes the trial results will allow it to market Darzalex as an earlier treatment, and in combination with standard medicines. The National Cancer Institute estimates there are 26,850 new cases of multiple myeloma each year in the United States. The average life expectancy is four years.

Revlimid sales soared about 18 percent to $1.70 billion, above Wall Street’s consensus estimate of about $1.66 billion. With Revlimid sales driven by new patient market share gains and longer duration of use, Celgene raised the full-year sales forecast for the medicine to $6.8 billion from $6.7 billion. Celgene suffered a setback this week in efforts to expand Revlimid’s uses when the drug failed to extend survival as a maintenance therapy for a type of lymphoma after patients had responded to prior treatment. But the company said it would be wrong to draw conclusions from that data regarding three other late-stage Revlimid lymphoma trials in different patient populations and treatment settings, and expressed confidence in its potential there. “Lymphoma will be a major growth driver in 2020 and beyond,” Michael Pehl, head of hematology and oncology, told analysts on a conference call. Celgene’s new psoriasis drug Otezla, which is also being tested for atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis, posted sales of $274 million in the quarter. “Otezla is on its way to hitting the $1 billion revenue milestone this year,” said Chief Operating Officer Jackie Fouse, adding that it would become the company’s fourth blockbuster product. The company also highlighted the potential of its experimental Crohn’s disease drug GED-301 as a key future growth driver, with important data expected this quarter. “If that data looks good, we think that could be a big catalyst for the stock,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, who called it a potential $2 billion a year product.

192,CELG,UPDATE 3-Amgen's multiple myeloma drug falls short in new-patient study,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said on Tuesday its multiple myeloma drug, Kyprolis, did not fare better than Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd’s older therapy Velcade in a study involving patients who had not yet been treated for the disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has already approved Kyprolis for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have previously undergone treatment. Patients treated with Kyprolis did not show a statistically significant improvement in slowing the cancer’s progression compared with those given Velcade in the late-stage study. Expectations of peak annual sales of about $2.3 billion for Kyprolis are now likely to cool, particularly since newly diagnosed patients constitute the largest market in terms of the number of patients and duration of therapy, some analysts said. Multiple myeloma, a type of aggressive and incurable blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow, kills about 12,600 people annually and will be diagnosed in about 30,000 Americans this year, according to the American Cancer Society. Baird analyst Brian Skorney said approval for previously untreated patients was “off the table” for now. The head-to-head study tested Kyprolis against the older Velcade in patients who were also given the chemothereutic agent melphalan and the immunosuppressant prednisone, and were deemed to be ineligible for stem-cell transplants. On a conference call with analysts, the company and experts said the “treatment landscape” for multiple myeloma was evolving dramatically and that melphalan/prednisone-based regimens were now rarely used due to their low efficacy and high toxicity.  Dr. Andrzej Jakubowiak, who was involved in the development of the Amgen drug, said on the call that the study was not the ideal way to evaluate Kyprolis in previously untreated patients. Amgen, whose shares were down 1.2 percent at $171.45, said it would continue to explore the drug’s benefit in combination with other agents. Kyprolis is also being tested in a separate late-stage trial in combination with Celgene Corp’s Revlimid and the steroid dexamethasone, or KRd, in this “front-line setting.” Jakubowiak said KRd was his first choice for previously untreated patients, and the results of the melphalan/prednisone study would not change this. Kyprolis has already been shown to be superior to Velcade, which is expected to go generic in 2017, in the later stages of multiple myeloma. Kyprolis faces greater competitive pressure as newer entrants in the multiple myeloma market gain traction, including Johnson & Johnson’s Darzalex, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Empliciti and Takeda’s Ninlaro. The Amgen drug generated $172 million in revenue in the second quarter.

199,CELG,"US STOCKS-Healthcare, tech stocks drive Wall Street higher","* Qualcomm top stock on S&P; on NXP buyout deal * Bristol-Myers, Celgene lead health stocks higher post results * Weekly jobless claims fall to 258,000 from 260,000 * Indexes up: Dow 0.17 pct, S&P; 0.18 pct, Nasdaq 0.32 pct   (Updates to open) By Yashaswini Swamynathan Oct 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street opened higher on Thursday as a flurry of strong corporate results from healthcare companies and a multi-billion dollar deal in the technology sector boosted sentiment about equity markets. Profits at S&P; 500 companies have largely exceeded analysts’ estimates for the third quarter so far, setting up for the first profit growth since the second quarter of 2015. Overall earnings for the S&P; 500 companies in the latest quarter are expected to rise 2.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Investors also took Qualcomm’s deal to buy NXP Semiconductors for about $47 billion as a sign of confidence in the U.S. equity market. NXP’s shares rose 2.32 percent, while Qualcomm was the top stock on the S&P; at 4 percent higher. Stocks of other chipmakers including Micron Tech were also higher. The health sector rose 0.78 percent, the top gainer among the 11 major S&P; 500 indexes, led by gains in Bristol-Myers and Celgene following strong results. The health sector has been among the worst performers this month as investors remain concerned about policies such as drug pricing which has been a key point of discussion in the run-up to the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. “Thus far with low expectations for earnings growth, profits have pleasantly surprised to the upside and there is a little bit of a rotation taking place out of big single names like Apple into other names like Tesla,” said John Brady, senior vice president at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in Chicago. “Likewise, energy names are under-owned and if crude stays around the $50 level, money is going to come out of the sidelines and into these companies.” Oil prices rose for the first time this week on Thursday as a further drop in U.S. crude inventories countered investor doubts that OPEC will be able to implement a production cut. At 9:38 a.m. ET (1338 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 30.44 points, or 0.17 percent, at 18,229.77. The S&P; 500 was up 3.84 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,143.27 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 16.57 points, or 0.32 percent, at 5,266.84. Data on Thursday showed the number of American filing for jobless claims fell last week, pointing to a firming labor market, while a separate report showed new orders for U.S. manufactured capital goods unexpectedly fell in September amid weak demand for electronic products. The data will play into the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates at its policy meeting next week. Though a rate hike is not the likely outcome of the meeting that falls days before the U.S. presidential election, traders expect the Fed to chalk a more definite path for a move in December. Twitter rose nearly 5 percent after its quarterly results beat expectations. The technology sector was the second biggest boost on the S&P.; Tesla jumped 4.4 percent to $211.33 after the electric carmaker reported its first quarterly net profit in more than three years. F5 Networks jumped nearly 10 percent and was the biggest gainer on the S&P;, after its quarterly revenue beat estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,395 to 1,200. On the Nasdaq, 1,400 issues rose and 763 fell. The S&P; 500 index showed 11 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 32 new highs and 24 new lows.

The U.S. biotech company reiterated its 2020 forecast for sales exceeding $21 billion as Chief Executive Officer Mark Alles kicked off the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. Following the official presentation, Chief Operating Officer Jackie Fouse said the 2020 forecast was largely based on increasing sales of its existing product portfolio. Positive data from the experimental multiple sclerosis drug ozonimod could lead to a revision of 2020 revenue targets, she said. The company has 10 products in development with billion-dollar potential, four of them multibillion-dollar opportunities, Fouse said.  Celgene expects to file for approval of ozonimod by year-end. The company forecast 2017 earnings of $7.10 to $7.75 per share before special items, up from its prior view of $6.75 to $7.00. It raised its revenue outlook to a range of $13 billion to $13.4 billion from $12.7 billion to $13 billion.   Analysts on average were expecting a 2017 profit of $7.04 per share and revenue of $13.2 billion. Investors were not thrilled, possibly because of the conservative long-term outlook or an updated 2016 revenue estimate slightly below Wall Street expectations. Celgene shares fell more than 1 percent before trimming losses.  “Celgene is trading down modestly as expectations were high going in,” Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti said in a research note, even though the “2017 EPS guide was slightly above the Street” and revenue was in line with expectations. For 2016, Celgene said it expected product sales of about $11.2 billion and earnings of about $5.94 per share, excluding items. Analysts on average forecast a profit of $5.92 and revenue of $11.29 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company sees 2017 Revlimid sales of $8 billion to $8.2 billion.   Alles highlighted the company’s pipeline opportunities and various partnerships, saying it expected data from 19 late-stage trials through 2018.  “We are entering a pivotal two-year period with multiple catalysts increasing our confidence in our ability to achieve or exceed our 2020 targets and sustain our growth from 2020 to 2030,” Alles said. The company said it could significantly expand its Abraxane franchise for solid tumor cancers, pointing to multiple lung cancer trials in combination with new immuno-oncology drugs. Alles said he believed Abraxane could eventually help cure certain subsets of early-stage pancreatic cancer. “This would be groundbreaking,” he said.

U.S. District Judge George King in Los Angeles, who has since retired, mostly denied Celgene’s motion for summary judgment in December, ruling that Celgene could be liable under the False Claims Act for bills submitted to Medicare or Medicaid that were ineligible for reimbursement because they were for off-label uses. Such claims were implicitly false, he said, even if they did not contain explicit false statements.

235,CELG,Celgene 1st quarter sales miss; expects psoriasis drug rebound,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp on Thursday reported lower-than-expected first-quarter revenue with Otezla sales well short of Wall Street estimates, but the U.S. biotechnology company promised  the psoriasis drug was poised to rebound. Lower costs helped the company beat analysts’ earnings expectations by 5 cents, and Celgene raised both ends of its  full-year forecast by that amount. It now expects adjusted earnings of $7.15 to $7.30 per share. Otezla sales of $242 million missed analysts’ estimates by nearly $100 million. Contraction in the overall psoriasis market, greater discounting, and inventory drawdown contributed to the Otezla  disappointment. But Celgene said it was already seeing a sales rebound, and that three new multi-year contracts with payers that no longer require patients to try older biologic treatments before Otezla was “going to have a very positive effect on our market share towards the second half of the year.” Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Mara Goldstein agreed that the Otezla weakness was likely temporary.  “It’s our belief that it’s a one-quarter phenomenon because we think the company will add new patients onto therapy at a rate that will overcome whatever first-quarter contraction we saw.” Revlimid, Celgene’s flagship drug for multiple myeloma, continued to be the gift that keeps on giving with sales up  nearly 20 percent to $1.88 billion due to increases in new and repeat prescriptions and longer average duration of use. The company sees U.S. and European approvals for Revlimid as long-term maintenance therapy following stem cell transplants as a major opportunity to grow sales. Total revenue rose 18 percent to $2.96 billion in the quarter, below Wall Street estimates of $3.03 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales of cancer drug Abraxane rose 5 percent to $236 million, also below expectations of about $243 million.   However, Chief Executive Mark Alles on an conference call said Celgene was “on track to achieve or exceed our 2020 outlook.” Celgene said it has 14 drugs with at least billion-dollar potential in its developmental pipeline, and has the financial flexibility to build on that through more deals. “Pipeline execution is what is needed to expand the company’s valuation and we see that occurring,” Goldstein said. Net profit for the quarter rose to $941 million, or $1.16 per share, from $801 million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Celgene earned $1.68 per share.

Total revenue rose about 17.8 percent to $2.96 billion in the quarter, but was below estimates of $3.03 billion partly due to lower-than-expected sales of its psoriasis drug. The company’s cancer treatment Abraxane generated sales of $236 million and its psoriasis drug Otezla brought in $242 million.

BeiGene will acquire Celgene’s operations in China and will also license and assume commercial responsibility for Celgene’s approved therapies in China. BeiGene’s advanced clinical-stage investigational tumor cancer treatment, BGB-A317, is a type of antibody that belongs to a class of immuno-oncology agents known as immune checkpoint inhibitors. The treatment has been tested in over 500 patients, with initial clinical data suggesting that it is well tolerated and exhibits anti-tumor activity across a range of solid tumor types, the companies said. BeiGene will retain exclusive global rights for the development and commercialization of BGB-A317 for malignancies related to blood-forming tissues and for solid tumors in Asia, excluding Japan.

252,CELG,FDA puts hold on Merck multiple myeloma trials after deaths,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co (MRK.N) said on Wednesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had placed a clinical hold on three multiple myeloma studies testing its Keytruda in combination with other medicines for the blood cancer after more deaths were reported in patients receiving the Merck immunotherapy. The rare setback for Keytruda sent Merck shares more than 1 percent lower. Merck has been on a roll with the medicine, jumping to the front of the pack of companies with new immuno-oncology drugs, particularly after Keytruda extended survival as an initial treatment for advanced lung cancer, by far the largest oncology market. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) had been the perceived leader in the field until last year, when its Opdivo failed to match Keytruda’s lung cancer success. Merck last month said it had stopped enrolling patients in the trials testing Keytruda in combination with standard multiple myeloma regimens including Celgene Corp (CELG.O) drugs. The decision was taken after independent safety monitors observed more deaths in patients receiving the Keytruda combination than in the control groups in two of the studies. The FDA said based on available data the risks of combining Keytruda with either of the Celgene medicines outweigh any potential benefit for patients with multiple myeloma. The trials were testing Keytruda with either Revlimid or Pomalyst and dexamethasone against the regimens without Keytruda. All patients who were receiving Keytruda in combination with a Celgene drug will no longer take the Merck drug. The clinical hold does not apply to other studies with Keytruda, Merck said. The drug, which helps the immune system fight cancer by blocking a protein tumors use to avoid detection, is currently being tested in hundreds of combination trials in a wide variety of cancers. So far, Keytruda is only approved for one type of blood cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma. But Merck has had a string of successes in solid tumor cancers with approvals for advanced melanoma, advanced bladder cancer and a type of head and neck cancer, in addition to lung. In May, Keytruda became the first cancer drug to win U.S.  approval based on a patient’s specific genetic traits, regardless of where in the body the disease originated, known as microsatellite instability-high cancer. Merck shares fell to $63.40 in extended trading from a New York Stock Exchange close at $64.16.

254,CELG,Celgene to pay $280 million to settle off-label marketing case,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday that Celgene Corp (CELG.O) had agreed to pay $280 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of promoting its cancer drugs Revlimid and Thalomid for off-label uses. In a statement, Celgene said it has agreed to resolve a “whistleblower” lawsuit that alleged it had violated the federal False Claims Act by submitting false claims to Medicare. The company has denied any wrongdoing in this matter, but said it was settling to avoid the “uncertainty, distraction, and expense of protracted litigation”. The lawsuit alleged that Celgene violated the laws of 28 states and the District of Columbia by submitting fraudulent claims to state healthcare programs, including California’s Medi-Cal program. The DoJ said Celgene was expected to pay the settlement on Wednesday. On March 1, Reuters reported that Celgene and the whistleblower, Beverly Brown, had asked the judge presiding over the case not to issue any substantive rulings for 30 days while they pursue mediation. Brown, a former sales representative for the company, sued New Jersey-based Celgene in 2010, bringing claims on behalf of the federal government and about two dozen states, including California, Illinois, Texas and New Jersey. The case was unsealed in 2014. Brown claimed that Celgene engaged in the off-label marketing of its drugs, which caused off-label prescriptions that were ineligible for reimbursement to be submitted to Medicare and state Medicaid programs, violating the federal False Claims Act. Thalomid was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1998 to treat a rare skin disease related to leprosy. The drug’s active chemical, thalidomide, was known for causing birth defects when it was used to treat morning sickness in the 1950s and 1960s.  Celegene’s flagship drug Revlimid, approved in 2005, is a chemical derivative of thalidomide. Both drugs are now approved for use in some cancer patients. Brown said in her lawsuit that Celgene promoted the drugs as cancer treatments for which they were not approved. The promotional efforts included kickbacks paid to doctors to speak about the drugs, her complaint said.

257,CELG,Revlimid drives Celgene profit beat; raises EPS forecast,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp rode its flagship multiple myeloma drug Revlimid and a rebound in sales of Otezla for psoriasis to a modestly higher-than-expected second-quarter profit and raised its full-year earnings forecast on Thursday. But the solid results failed to impress investors and Celgene shares, which are up about 17 percent for the year, slipped 1 percent to $136.40 after touching a two-year high of $139. Analysts said the results may have come up short of investors’ lofty expectations for Celgene. Revlimid sales rose 19.6 percent to $2.03 billion on increases in duration of use and new reimbursement agreements in Europe. Celgene said duration of Revlimid use was now well beyond 20 months in the United States and expects duration in Europe to become similar. It added that it has not yet seen the full sales impact of longer Revlimid use by patients. “Revlimid looks to have a bright future, including much remaining patent exclusivity and the opportunity to grow penetration in U.S. and ex-U.S. markets based upon recent label expansions,” Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. Sales of Otezla, which had investors nervous after a surprisingly weak first quarter, bounced back, rising 48.5 percent to $358 million, exceeding Wall Street estimates of $345 million. However Celgene head of inflammation and immunology, Terrie Curran, cautioned that full-year Otezla sales would likely come in at the low end of its $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion forecast. Celgene provided updates on its large portfolio of pipeline opportunities it believes can drive growth through 2030. The company expects U.S. approval of the leukemia drug Idhifa, developed with Agios Pharmaceuticals, by late August, and plans to file for approval of ozanimod for multiple sclerosis by year end. Celgene forecast eventual ozanimod annual sales for MS and ulcerative colitis to climb as high as $6 billion.

260,CELG,"FDA approves leukemia treatment developed by Celgene, Agios","(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday approved Celgene Corp and Agios Pharmaceuticals Inc’s oral treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with a rare genetic mutation. The drug, Idhifa, will have a monthly list price of $24,872, Celgene said in an email, noting that the median time on therapy for patients was 4.3 months in the trial to secure the FDA’s approval. The list price of a drug is not necessarily what patients actually pay. Their ‘out-of-pocket’ cost is based on their individual healthcare insurance plans and duration of treatment. AML is a cancer that originates in the bone marrow and progresses rapidly, resulting in an abnormal increase in white blood cells. It is generally diagnosed in older people, and is uncommon before the age of 45. The drug secured approval for relapsed or refractory AML patients with an IDH2 mutation. It is to be used along with a diagnostic test, developed by Abbott Laboratories, designed to detect the mutation. “While the product isn’t expected to be a big needle mover for Celgene, it does represent the first approval for a partnered product,” J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said, pointing out that the drug targeted “an area of clear high unmet need”. Novartis AG’s recently approved AML drug, Rydapt, has a list price of $7,495 for a 14-day treatment duration and $14,990 for a 28-day duration. However, Novartis’ treatment is approved for newly diagnosed patients with AML carrying a specific genetic mutation called FLT3. Idhifa’s approval comes with a boxed warning — the strongest mandated by the FDA — designed to call attention to the risk of differentiation syndrome, an adverse reaction that could be fatal if untreated. Differentiation syndrome is characterized by fever, respiratory distress and multi-organ dysfunction.     Idhifa is the first and only FDA-approved therapy for patients with an IDH2 mutation, a group that accounts for 8 to 19 percent of all AML patients. In the United States, that translates to about 1,200 to 1,500 patients, Celgene said.  Oppenheimer’s Leah Rush Cann said in a client note that the drug could generate sales of $1.4 billion in 2021. About 21,380 new cases of AML will be diagnosed in 2017 and some 10,590 patients will succumb to the disease this year, according to estimates by the American Cancer Society.

269,CELG,FDA widens holds on immunotherapy combination blood cancer trials,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators stopped five blood cancer trials testing AstraZeneca Plc’s immunotherapy Imfinzi in combination with Celgene Corp medicines from accepting new patients  and halted another study entirely, the companies said on Thursday.   The Food and Drug Administration’s decisions stem from safety concerns uncovered in similar blood cancer trials of Merck & Co Inc’s rival Keytruda medicine in combination with widely used multiple myeloma drugs that Celgene sells. The news follows Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s announcement on Wednesday that the FDA had placed similar partial clinical holds on three trials of the company’s Opdivo immunotherapy in combination with multiple myeloma treatments. The FDA placed a hold on three Merck multiple myeloma combination trials in July after safety monitors reported more deaths among patients who received Keytruda than those in the control group. Keytruda, Opdivo and Imfinzi belong to a new high-profile class of drugs called PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors that work by blocking a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system. They have received numerous approvals for other cancers, such as lung cancer and melanoma. Several companies are testing similar drugs against a wide variety of cancers. Further clinical hold announcements are possible if they are being tested against blood cancers as the FDA works “to better understand the true cause of the safety concerns,” it said last week. The FDA said it still believed the benefits of Keytruda and rival medicines in the class outweigh risks when taken for their approved uses. Under the partial clinical holds placed on the Bristol-Myers and the AstraZeneca-Celgene studies, patients who were experiencing clinical benefits can continue treatment, but no new patients will be enrolled. Patients in the study under full clinical hold will no longer receive the treatment, the companies said. Most of the affected combination studies were for multiple myeloma. One of the trials under partial hold was testing Imfinzi, known chemically as durvalumab, in patients with lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Celgene said it had not identified an imbalance in the risk/benefit profile in its trials, suggesting that the safety issue reported in the Keytruda studies had not cropped up in its trials with the AstraZeneca drug. Celgene shares were up 1.3 percent, while AstraZeneca, which announced positive trial results for an asthma drug, gained more than 4 percent.

Keytruda, Opdivo and Imfinzi belong to a new high-profile class of drugs called PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors that work by blocking a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system. They have received numerous approvals for other cancers, such as lung cancer and melanoma. Several companies are testing similar drugs against a wide variety of cancers. Further clinical hold announcements are possible if they are being tested against blood cancers as the FDA works “to better understand the true cause of the safety concerns,” it said last week. The FDA said it still believed the benefits of Keytruda and rival medicines in the class outweigh risks when taken for their approved uses. Under the partial clinical holds placed on the Bristol-Myers and the AstraZeneca-Celgene studies, patients who were experiencing clinical benefits can continue treatment, but no new patients will be enrolled. Patients in the study under full clinical hold will no longer receive the treatment, the companies said. Most of the affected combination studies were for multiple myeloma. One of the trials under partial hold was testing Imfinzi, known chemically as durvalumab, in patients with lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Celgene said it had not identified an imbalance in the risk/benefit profile in its trials, suggesting that the safety issue reported in the Keytruda studies had not cropped up in its trials with the AstraZeneca drug. Celgene shares were up 1.3 percent, while AstraZeneca, which announced positive trial results for an asthma drug, gained more than 4 percent.

281,CELG,"Celgene abandons Crohn's drug trials, shares drop","(Reuters) - Celgene Corp said it would abandon testing a drug to treat Crohn’s disease, in a major setback to the U.S. biotechnology company’s pipeline amid attempts to lower dependence on its mainstay Revilimid. The company’s shares fell 6.4 percent to $136.96 in extended trading on Thursday.     Celgene said it would stop two trials of the drug, mongersen, and would not initiate a third study following a risk-benefit analysis by a data monitoring committee. Morgan Stanley analysts said the decision was likely based on lack of efficacy, given that management did not identify any safety imbalances. The drug was being tested in late-stage and extension studies as a treatment for Crohn’s.  Investors thought the drug was a significant potential upside driver despite being one of the more risky assets in Celgene’s pipeline, Morgan Stanley analysts said. Mongersen is forecast to rake in sales of more than $1 billion by 2023, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Celgene is waiting to review full data from a mid-stage study testing mongersen as an ulcerative colitis treatment to determine next steps. The company said it expects pre-tax charge in the range of $300 million to $500 million, or 27 cents to 45 cents per share after tax, from the discontinuation. Celegene’s flagship multiple myleoma treatment, Revlimid, brought in sales of $3.92 billion and accounted for about 63 percent of total revenue in the second quarter ended June 30. Inflammatory bowel diseases, which include Crohn’s, affect about 1.6 million Americans, according to Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.      Crohn’s affects the lining of the digestive tract and can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea and rectal bleeding.

U.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul appeared to back the administration’s sweeping tax cut plan, saying he was “all in” for massive tax cuts, even as the Senate passed a key budget measure without his support one day earlier. Equities rose on Wall Street, with financials .SPSY, which are expected to benefit from the administration’s proposed policies, up 1.16 percent as the best performer of 11 major S&P; sectors. “It’s just a reaction to the thought that just maybe there might be something coming from Congress in the way of tax reform,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “Everybody had kind of given up hope, and after the comments over the last 24 hours, people are like, shoot, this may actually happen.”  Housing stocks .HGX also moved higher, up 0.70 percent, after data from the National Association of Realtors showed U.S. home resales unexpectedly increased in September.  But gains were curbed by declines in Celgene (CELG.O), off 10.76 percent after the company said it would abandon drug trials for a Crohn’s disease treatment.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 165.59 points, or 0.71 percent, to 23,328.63, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 13.1 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,575.2 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 23.99 points, or 0.36 percent, to 6,629.05.

Bets that Trump’s planned tax cuts, infrastructure spending and other pro-business measures would push up growth and inflation had been behind a reflation trade that propelled the dollar to 14-year highs earlier this year.

288,CELG,"Celgene cuts 2020 outlook, Otezla sales disappoint; shares plunge","(Reuters) - Celgene Corp on Thursday reported third-quarter sales of its key psoriasis drug Otezla that badly missed expectations and significantly scaled down its 2020 targets for product sales and earnings, sending its shares tumbling 18 percent. Celgene, which also missed estimates for quarterly revenue, has seen it shares lose about 30 percent of their value in October alone. Investors have been concerned about patent challenges to its long-time cash cow Revlimid for multiple myeloma and the surprise failure last week of an experimental Crohn’s disease drug touted as a future multibillion-dollar product. Celgene shares fell by $23.23, or 19 percent, to $96.33. The stock’s decline was the biggest drag on the benchmark S&P; 500 equity index and the Nasdaq index. The company said it would initiate immediate share repurchases from $3.8 billion remaining on its authorization. Celgene leadership did not attempt to sugarcoat the situation, but highlighted future pipeline opportunities with a dozen pivotal data readouts expected by the end of 2018. “We’re very disappointed with the results of the quarter and are committed to rebounding very quickly with respect to Otezla and our overall performance,” Chief Executive Mark Alles said, adding the Crohn’s drug failure was “a major disappointment.” Otezla sales of $308 million in the quarter missed analyst estimates by over $100 million. The company blamed slowing growth in both the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis markets in the U.S. due to reimbursement challenges from insurers. The “Otezla miss is the biggest story of the quarter,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said.  The biotechnology company lowered its full-year Otezla sales forecast to $1.25 billion, from a range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. For 2020, Celgene lowered its adjusted earnings forecast to greater than $12.50 per share from greater than $13.00. It slashed its 2020 oncology sales forecast to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, from its prior projection of at least $2.2 billion, suggesting possible concerns about growth of Pomalyst and Abraxane. Long-range targets for inflammation and immunology sales were cut to $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion, from greater than $4 billion, reflecting continuing Otezla challenges and the disappearance of GED-0301, the once-promising Crohn’s drug. Celgene signaled high hopes for its experimental multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod, with key data imminent. It also said it would test the medicine for Crohn’s, citing a large unmet need in irritable bowel diseases. Revlimid sales for the quarter rose 10 percent to $2.08 billion, shy of analyst estimates of $2.11 billion. But the company maintained its 2017 forecast of up to $8.3 billion. Total revenue rose nearly 11 percent to $3.29 billion, short of analyst’ estimates of $3.42 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, Celgene earned $1.91 per share, topping analysts’ average forecasts by 4 cents with help from cost controls. It also raised the low end of its 2017 adjusted profit forecast by 5 cents and now expects $7.30 to $7.35 per share. Despite the failure of GED-0301, which came to Celgene via acquisition, the company said it would continue aggressive business development efforts.

British stocks did not however fully join in the strong rally among European equities, boosted by a weaker euro after the European Central Bank committed to extending asset purchases until at least September 2018. Barclays was the standout faller, its shares down 7.4 percent to their lowest in a year, after the bank missed estimates for third-quarter profit on the back of weak trading performance at its investment banking division. Barclays has been the worst-performing bank on the FTSE 100 this year, down 18.6 percent year-to-date. Barclays’ results contrasted with Lloyds’, whose shares ended Wednesday’s session with a slight gain despite an initial wobble. “The main thing (with Barclays) is there’s been a big drop in the income from the investment bank, which is more of a market-wide issue ... and probably a bit of sideways movement in the rest of the business,” Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said. “It’s a bit of a damp squib of a set of results.” GlaxoSmithKline shares fell 3.4 percent, extending Wednesday’s post-results losses to hit their lowest since the Brexit vote aftermath, after Credit Suisse cut its target price on the pharma stock. Analysts at the Swiss bank pointed to uncertainty over Glaxo’s HIV segment ViiV and said the company’s post-results call was more cautious than expected. Healthcare firm Shire fell 2.1 percent despite earlier receiving European approval for its drug Firazyr to be extended to paediatric patients. Shore Capital analysts put the drop down to a profit warning from U.S. biotech company Celgene. “Celgene has been a bellwether for the sector,” said ShoreCap analyst Tara Raveendran. Among mid and small-caps, Spire Health shares also fell 3.2 percent and Biotech Growth Trust dropped 4 percent. Analytics and information firm RELX meanwhile gained 3 percent after a trading update analysts said was in line with expectations. Foreign-earning consumer goods stocks British American Tobacco and Unilever added the most points to the index, while miners Rio Tinto, Anglo American and BHP Billiton also supported. Galliford Try and Barratt Development shares fell as they went ex-dividend. So far the British third-quarter results season has been marred by significant share price drops from large-cap firms such as Convatec and Whitbread, as well as profit warnings from small-caps Pendragon and Dialight earlier in the week. “If you look at UK domestic firms, there’s quite a lot of bad news that’s expected because Brexit is hanging over results,” Hargeaves Lansdown’s Khalaf said. Estimates from Morgan Stanley show earnings are expected to grow by more than 20 percent in the United Kingdom in 2017, against 12.6 percent growth for MSCI Europe. A high proportion of Britain’s earnings growth is driven by the heavyweight energy sector, however, and is also helped by a weaker pound. Morgan Stanley expects British earnings growth to weaken in 2018 and 2019.

The equity market appeared to shrug off an explosion at one of New York’s busiest commuter hubs early on Monday morning that officials called an attempted terrorist attack. The suspect wounded himself and three others. “There has been some relief the terrorist attack wasn’t worse,” said Mark Heppenstall, CIO at Penn Mutual Asset Management Horsham, Pennsylvania. Traders, waiting for the Fed’s two-day rate setting meeting to begin on Tuesday, see a 85 percent probability for a 25 basis point hike to the Fed funds rate target - the third rate hike this year, according to CME Group’s Fedwatch tool. “The grind higher continues. The Fed is a virtual certainty to tighten this week but that is totally priced in by the market,” said Heppenstall. “Valuations are getting to the point where even good news on the economy might pose some additional risks to the market. There’s the risk that good news for the economy may be bad news for markets because the Fed is at the cusp of a level of tightening that could dampen growth.” At 2:38 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 31.57 points, or 0.13 percent, to 24,360.73, the S&P; 500 gained 6.14 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,657.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 31.59 points, or 0.46 percent, to 6,871.67. Seven of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the biggest boost coming from the information technology sector with a 0.74 percent gain. The S&P; energy index was up 0.7 percent as oil prices rose after a North Sea pipeline shut for repairs and some investors focused on commodities following the explosion in New York. Financial, consumer staple and industrial stocks were the biggest losers. CenturyLink was the biggest S&P; 500 percentage gainer, rising about 9 percent after the telecom provider signed a 5-year contract with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Healthcare investors focused on makers of drugs for blood disorders after clinical data presentations at the annual American Society of Hematology four-day meeting in Atlanta. Shares of Bluebird Bio were last up 19 percent at $203.75 after hitting a record high of $222.03 following news of positive responses in an early stage myeloma study of its experimental gene-modifying immunotherapy drug co-developed with Celgene. Celgene’s shares were up 1.97 percent. Interest in the surge in digital currency bitcoin and the opening of futures trading in the cryptocurrency continued to fuel bets on related stocks, many of which have risen sharply in the past three months. Shares of Marathon Patent was up 27 percent while Xunlei was up 18 percent. Riot Blockchain rose about 37 percent. Bitcoin futures soared in their U.S. debut on Sunday, which backers hope will encourage wider use and give legitimacy to cryptocurrency. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.13-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

303,CELG,UPDATE 1-Celgene's follicular lymphoma regimen fails clinical trial,"(Adds details of trial) Dec 21 (Reuters) - Celgene Corp said on Thursday it failed to show that combining its cancer drug Revlimid with the cancer drug rituximab was more effective in treating follicular lymphoma than the standard combination of rituximab and chemotherapy. The clinical trial was the first to study a chemotherapy-free regimen in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma, a slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Chemotherapy typically has harsher side effects than more targeted biologic treatments such as Revlimid and rituximab, which is sold by Roche Holding AG under the brand name Rituxan. Results of the late-stage study showed that patients in the Revlimid cohort did not have a greater period of progression-free survival than the chemotherapy group, nor were there more patients who experienced a complete response to the treatment. Michael Yee, an analyst at Jefferies, said the result “is not that big of a surprise, given that previous commentary from the company was somewhat mixed.” Celgene shares fell 5.8 percent to $102.10 in extended trading.

Nike forecast muted current-quarter revenue growth on Thursday, highlighting its struggles to regain market share in North America from Adidas. The stock dragged down the S&P; consumer discretionary index , which was the biggest loser among the 11 major S&P; sectors, with a 0.34 percent fall. However, the staples index was helped by a 0.7 percent rise in Procter & Gamble and a 0.4 percent gain in Philip Morris. Major Wall Street indexes were on track to end the week higher, buoyed by a historic overhaul of the U.S. tax code that is expected to benefit corporates due to a significant tax cut. Investors were also relieved after the U.S. Congress averted a government shutdown on Thursday just one day before federal funding was due to expire. “We’re in a bullish phase and investors have things to feel good about - a strong economy as witnessed by a 3.2 percent growth in GDP, a tax plan that is all but signed,” said Andres Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC  in Bernardsville, New Jersey. “The tax plan will add more credibility to the Republican government and will be used as a leverage to get more things done.” Volumes are expected to be muted on Friday ahead of the Christmas holiday on Monday.

310,CELG,"Celgene 2018 revenue forecast shy of estimates, shares fall","(Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O), which has announced a deal to buy Impact Biomedicines, on Monday forecast 2018 total revenue that fell short of analysts’ estimates, sending the U.S. biotech company’s shares down 2 percent. Celgene, which left its long-range 2020 forecast unchanged,  said it expects 2018 full-year revenue of $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion. Analysts’ on average were estimating revenue of $14.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While headlines suggested the Impact deal announced on Sunday could cost up to $7 billion, Celgene said the only certain cost was the upfront payment of $1.1 billion, with all other payments contingent on approval and major sales milestones for fedratinib, a late stage drug for myelofibrosis. With the addition of fedratinib, Celgene said at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco that it will have 10 late-stage medicines with $1 billion to multibillion-dollar potential that could add more than $15 billion in peak revenue through 2030 as it girds for the eventual loss of patent exclusivity on its flagship blood cancer drug Revlimid. Meanwhile, Revlimid continues to grow. Celgene forecast about $9.4 billion for 2018 Revlimid sales, or 15 percent growth. Celgene also has partnerships with companies developing potentially transformational cancer therapies, including bluebird bio (BLUE.O), Juno Therapeutics JUNO.O and Agios Therapeutics (AGIO.O). Despite multiple collaborations and a robust developmental pipeline, Chief Executive Mark Alles told the conference the company intends to invest heavily in research and business development in 2018. He said U.S. tax law changes would enable Celgene to access 60 percent of its operational cash flow to deploy as it sees fit, overseas money that previously would have been subject to heavy taxation if it was used in the United States. The company estimated its one-time transition tax under new rules would be between $800 million and $1.3 billion and expects to be able to announce the actual cost later this month. Celgene forecast 2018 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $8.70 to $8.90 per share, a midpoint above the average analysts’ estimate of $8.71 per share. The company reiterated its 2020 forecast for revenue of $19 billion to $20 billion, with adjusted earnings to exceed $12.50 per share. For the 2017 fourth quarter, Celgene expects total revenue of $3.48 billion, slightly higher than the average estimate of $3.46 billion.

Celgene also has partnerships with companies developing potentially transformational cancer therapies, including bluebird bio (BLUE.O), Juno Therapeutics JUNO.O and Agios Therapeutics (AGIO.O). Despite multiple collaborations and a robust developmental pipeline, Chief Executive Mark Alles told the conference the company intends to invest heavily in research and business development in 2018. He said U.S. tax law changes would enable Celgene to access 60 percent of its operational cash flow to deploy as it sees fit, overseas money that previously would have been subject to heavy taxation if it was used in the United States. The company estimated its one-time transition tax under new rules would be between $800 million and $1.3 billion and expects to be able to announce the actual cost later this month. Celgene forecast 2018 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $8.70 to $8.90 per share, a midpoint above the average analysts’ estimate of $8.71 per share. The company reiterated its 2020 forecast for revenue of $19 billion to $20 billion, with adjusted earnings to exceed $12.50 per share. For the 2017 fourth quarter, Celgene expects total revenue of $3.48 billion, slightly higher than the average estimate of $3.46 billion. Celgene shares were down $2.04, or 1.9 percent in early-afternoon trading at $102.94.

Celgene will pay an additional $1.4 billion, depending on the receipt of U.S. Food and Drug Administration milestone approvals.

318,CELG,CORRECTED-Bluebird to seek approvals for three treatments by end of 2019,"(Reuters) - U.S. biotech bluebird bio Inc, which does not yet have any marketed products, expects to be able to file for regulatory approval of three novel treatments by the end of 2019, chief executive Nick Leschly announced on Tuesday. Bluebird expects to file for approval this year for its treatment for transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia, which is intended to eliminate the need for repeated transfusions for the inherited blood disorder, Leschly said at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. The other two treatments are bluebird’s CAR-T therapy for multiple myeloma, being developed with partner Celgene Corp, and a treatment for a rare and deadly genetic brain disorder, cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, both of which have demonstrated impressive early results. The company caused a stir at the American Society of Hematology meeting in December with its CAR-T bb2121 as the therapy led to extremely high response and remission rates with good safety in a small study of heavily pretreated multiple myeloma patients who had run out of options. Leschly said the company expects to file for U.S. and European approval of bb2121 in 2019. Beyond those three, bluebird is also developing a promising treatment for sickle cell disease, a potentially life-shortening inherited blood disorder that causes severe pain and often leads to repeat hospitalizations. The company plans to discuss appropriate endpoints for future sickle cell clinical trials with health regulators and will provide an update on the program at the end of the year, the CEO said. He said the company is looking to develop “the right pricing and reimbursement strategy” for treatments expected to be extremely expensive. The first two approved CAR-T treatments for other cancers from Novartis and Gilead Sciences were priced at $475,000 and $373,000, respectively, for the one-time treatments. As bluebird progresses toward a portfolio of potentially game-changing commercial treatments, Leschly said one of his overriding principles is: “Don’t do stupid shortsighted stuff.” “We haven’t done anything yet,” Leschly said. “We need to deliver products to patients.” (This version corrects name of multiple myeloma drug to bb2121 from b2121 in fourth and fifth paragraphs) ",1092018,http://www.reuters.com/article/healthcare-conference-bluebird-bio/corrected-bluebird-to-seek-approvals-for-three-treatments-by-end-of-2019-idUSL1N1P418W
319,CELG,Celgene in talks to buy Juno Therapeutics: WSJ,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) is in talks to buy Juno Therapeutics Inc JUNO.O, which is working on an experimental gene therapy drug to treat cancer, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the matter. (on.wsj.com/2EMlysO) Shares of Juno, which has a market value of $5.57 billion,  were up 42 percent at $64.59 in extended trading. Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, or CAR T, harnesses the body’s own immune cells to recognize and attack malignant cells. Novartis (NOVN.S) received the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for a CAR T drug last year. Juno does not yet have any FDA approvals for its CAR T drugs, but it released promising data from early trials for a blood cancer treatment in November. It has had previous setbacks in developing the treatments, and shut down development of one leukemia treatment due to severe neurotoxicity that led to five patient deaths. Still, CAR T treatments are expected to be blockbusters for drugmakers, costing up to $500,000 and generating billions of dollars in sales. Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) bought Juno rival Kite Pharma Inc for nearly $12 billion late last year. The WSJ report comes days after Celgene said it had agreed to acquire Impact Biomedicines for as much as $7 billion, subject to certain milestones associated with regulatory hurdles and sales performance. Senior executives from some of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers told Reuters last week that they expect the Trump administration’s tax overhaul to accelerate major acquisitions by drugmakers in 2018 after a slow year for deals in 2017.

322,CELG,Celgene to buy Juno for $9 billion to boost cancer pipeline,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp will pay $9 billion in cash to buy experimental cancer drugmaker Juno Therapeutics Inc, bulking up its developmental pipeline as it works to reduce reliance on its own cancer treatment Revlimid. Celgene said on Monday it would pay $87 per share for the roughly 90 percent of Juno it does not already own. Juno focuses on chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, known as CAR-T, which harnesses the body’s own immune cells to recognize and attack malignant cells. These types of gene therapies have been pegged by many in the pharmaceutical industry as a new frontier in cancer treatment.   Celgene’s bid represents a nearly 29 percent premium to Juno’s closing price of $67.81 on Friday, and the company’s shares were trading just below the bid at $86.12 on Monday morning. Juno’s stock was worth less than $46 as recently as last week, before the Wall Street Journal reported that the two companies were working on a deal.  Celgene has lost nearly 30 percent of its value since October, as investors sold off shares on concerns over patent challenges to its long-time cash cow Revlimid, weak sales of its key psoriasis drug Otezla and the failure of an experimental Crohn’s disease drug that had been touted as a potential blockbuster. “Celgene is in a desperate situation,” said Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments, which runs the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. “Their revenue growth is running out of gas and they needed to fix this immediately.” Shares of Celgene were at $102.61 on Monday. The two companies have been working together since 2015, when Celgene picked up 9.3 percent of Juno for $93 a share. Juno is yet to get an approval for a CAR-T drug, unlike its rivals Kite Pharma, bought by Gilead Sciences Inc for nearly $12 billion in 2017, and Novartis AG.  Juno’s closest drug to approval is its JCAR017 treatment for a type of blood cancer. The companies said they expect it to be approved in 2019 and could bring in peak sales of about $3 billion worldwide. It has had previous setbacks in developing the treatments, and shut down development of one leukemia treatment due to severe neurotoxicity that led to five patient deaths.     Analysts said new treatments from Juno should help diversify Celgene’s revenue base. Revlimid currently accounts for more than 60 percent of its sales. The deal is the second Celgene Chief Executive Mark Alles has struck in January, after agreeing to pay $1.1 billion - and as much as $7 billion if certain milestones are reached - for privately-held Impact Biomedicines.  The Summit, New Jersey-based company also has partnerships with bluebird bio Inc and Agios Pharmaceuticals Inc, both of which are developing cancer treatments. Celgene said the latest acquisition is expected to add to its 2020 target net revenue incrementally, but will not affect  adjusted earnings forecast of more than $13 per share.   The deal was one of two large biotech deals on Monday morning, as French drugmaker Sanofi also agreed to buy U.S. hemophilia expert Bioverativ for $11.6 billion, its biggest deal for seven years. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is the financial adviser for Celgene and Morgan Stanley & Co for Juno.

Defense stocks such as Boeing, Northrop Grumman and L3 Technologies dropped between 0.6 percent and 1.1 percent, sending the Dow Jones U.S. Defense sector index down 0.7 percent. Boosting the Nasdaq was a clutch of biotech deals, with the biotech index up about 2.3 percent.

Juno Therapeutics rose about 27 percent after Celgene agreed to buy the biotech for about $9 billion in cash. Insurer AIG said it would buy reinsurer Validus Holdings for $5.56 billion.

The acquisitions will fuel expectations for a busy year of mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) as large drugmakers snap up promising assets from smaller rivals to help revive growth. Sanofi agreed to buy U.S. hemophilia expert Bioverativ for $11.6 billion, its biggest deal for seven years, while Celgene is paying about $9 billion for the 90 percent of cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics it does not already own. The two cash deals were agreed at a prices of $105 and $87 per share respectively.

Other biotech stocks were driven higher by the takeover news, with rivals to Juno including Bluebird Bio , Sangamo Therapeutics  and Cellectis  each gaining around 10 percent. “The signs are good for biotech deal activity in 2018,” said Chris Stirling, head of KPMG’s global life sciences practice. Big companies are under pressure from declining sales of older treatments and many are struggling to find sufficient high-value replacements from within their own laboratories, making buying in products and know-how an attractive option. “It takes a long time to introduce technology that makes a significant difference, and in the interim CEOs are looking at any way to get their hands on product where they believe they can make a decent return,” Stirling said. “They’ve got to be seen to be doing things, otherwise they really struggle to convince investors.” Both Sanofi and Celgene had been seen as likely multibillion-dollar acquirers. The French group, which faces mounting competition in its key diabetes unit, lost out on buying U.S. cancer firm  Medivation to Pfizer in 2016, and also missed acquiring Swiss-based Actelion, which was bought by Johnson & Johnson last year. Celgene, meanwhile, needs to dilute its reliance on cancer drug Revlimid. It had been widely tipped as a buyer for Juno, whose technology is at the cutting edge of cancer treatment. Juno is one of several pioneers of a system to modify immune cells to fight tumors and its JCAR017 product is likely to reach the market in 2019, behind rival approval treatments from Novartis and Gilead. Gilead only recently jumped into the space after acquiring Kite Pharma last year for $12 billion in one of the few standout deals during a relatively subdued year for biotech M&A.; Despite the late start, Celgene believes JCAR017 could have peak annual sales of $3 billion and it sees the acquisition being “incrementally additive” to net product sales in 2020. Following setbacks at Juno, Celgene is paying less than the $93 a share it stumped up for just under 10 percent of the company in 2015.  Sanofi expects Bioverativ, which was spun off from Biogen last year, can deliver commercial success despite rapid changes in the $10 billion hemophilia market posed by a novel drug from Roche and the potential of gene therapy to provide a one-time cure.

327,CELG,WRAPUP 2-Biotech M&A; takes off as Sanofi and Celgene spend $20 billion,"(Reuters) - Biotech deal activity exploded on Monday with French drugmaker Sanofi and U.S.-based Celgene spending a combined total of more than $20 billion to add new products for hemophilia and cancer to their medicine cabinets. The acquisitions will fuel expectations for a busy year of mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) as large drugmakers snap up promising assets from smaller rivals to help revive growth. Sanofi agreed to buy U.S. hemophilia expert Bioverativ for $11.6 billion, its biggest deal for seven years, while Celgene is paying about $9 billion for the 90 percent of cancer specialist Juno Therapeutics it does not already own. The two cash deals were agreed at a prices of $105 and $87 per share respectively. Shares in Bioverativ leaped 63 percent in early U.S. trading and Juno jumped 27 percent, reflecting the offers, while Sanofi fell 4 percent. Celgene was little changed.

A U.S. government shutdown entered its third day, and a bipartisan group of senators attempted to negotiate a deal just hours before the full Senate planned to vote to restore funding. “It’s ‘Been there, done that’. We know they are actually going to get their act together and reach a deal. But the economic impact depends on how long it lasts,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. At 10:09 a.m. ET (1509 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.37 points, or -0 percent, at 26,071.35 and the S&P; 500 was up 5.51 points, or 0.20 percent, at 2,815.81. The Nasdaq Composite was up 19.37 points, or 0.26 percent, at 7,355.75. Shares in U.S. hemophilia specialist Bioverativ soared 63 percent after French healthcare group Sanofi agreed to buy the company for $11.6 billion. It was the top boost to the Nasdaq. Juno Therapeutics rose about 27 percent after Celgene agreed to buy the biotech for about $9 billion in cash. Celgene was down 1.5 percent. Insurer AIG said it would buy reinsurer Validus Holdings for $5.56 billion. Validus was up 45 percent. The S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq managed to notch record highs shortly after open on Monday, as investors focused on upbeat quarterly earnings and a raft of deals. Of the 53 S&P; 500 companies that reported through Friday, 79.2 percent have topped earnings estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Halliburton Co rose 2.7 percent on Monday after posting a much bigger-than-expected quarterly profit in the fourth quarter, benefiting from a shale-driven surge in U.S. oil production. Rival Schlumberger also rose 2.7 percent. Seven of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, led by a 0.82 percent gain in the energy index and 0.6 percent rise in utilities index. General Electric fell below $16 for the first time in six years, extending its losing streak from last week. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was close to its highest level in more than three years on Monday. “More concern is coming from the bond market where yields are testing a long-term resistance,” said Brown. “If the yields are going up, and if earnings stay the same, share prices would come down.” Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,258 to 1,256. On the Nasdaq, 1,247 issues rose and 1,181 fell. ",1222018,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks/us-stocks-dow-under-pressure-as-industrial-stocks-weigh-idUSL4N1PH4FQ

333,CELG,Bluebird CAR-T still top Celgene priority after Juno deal,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) said on Thursday that a pending $9 billion purchase of Juno Therapeutics JUNO.O in no way alters its focus on its partnership with Juno rival bluebird bio (BLUE.O). Juno and bluebird are both developing CAR-T treatments for different blood cancers. They are positioned to become the next entries of the potentially revolutionary therapy that genetically alters a patient’s immune cells to far more effectively fight cancers. “Working with bluebird to develop bb2121 remains a top priority,” Celgene Chief Executive Mark Alles said on a conference call. Celgene expects Juno’s JCAR017 to gain U.S. approval for a type of lymphoma in 2019 and projected eventual annual sales of about $3 billion. Bluebird’s CAR-T is being developed for relapsed multiple myeloma. With the potential to launch two CAR-T therapies over the next three years, Alles said Celgene intends to become “a global leader in cellular immumotherapy.”   CAR-T is an expensive one-time treatment seen as having  potential to be curative or hold cancer at bay long-term. Novartis (NOVN.S) and Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) earned the first CAR-T approvals last year with therapies priced at $475,000 and $373,000, respectively. Celgene said the Juno purchase would not prevent other deals, but that it does not believe there are holes in its developmental pipeline that need plugging. Celgene also highlighted the $1 billion-plus sales potential of fedratinib in myelofibrosis. It expects to file for U.S. approval in mid-2018 to treat newly diagnosed patients and those who cannot take Incyte Corp’s INCY. Jackafi. The company said it plans to file for European approval of its experimental multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod in the current quarter and awaits U.S. approval by year end.  Ozanimod is also being tested for Crohn’s disease and in combination with Celgene’s psoriasis drug Otezla for ulcerative colitis. Celgene reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings that topped analysts’ estimates by 3 cents a share, as sales of its flagship multiple myeloma drug Revlimid grew 21 percent to $2.19 billion. Otezla sales rose 22 percent to $371 million. “Otezla U.S. strength suggests plenty of room for global growth,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams.   The company preannounced 2017 results and reiterated its 2018 forecast for revenue of $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion and adjusted earnings of $8.70 to $8.90 per share at a healthcare conference this month. It posted a net loss for the quarter due to a $1.21 billion charge related to the U.S. tax overhaul. Celgene shares rose 1.2 percent to $104.36.

347,CELG,"U.S. FDA rejects filing for Celgene MS drug, shares fall","(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators have rejected Celgene Corp’s application seeking approval of a key multiple sclerosis drug due to insufficient data, the company said on Tuesday, a surprise development that will likely delay the entry to market of one of Celgene’s most important pipeline assets. Celgene shares fell nearly 8 percent after it revealed that it had received a “refusal to file” letter from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its ozanimod for the treatment of patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Celgene last month had said it expected U.S. approval of ozanimod by the end of this year and planned to file for European approval during the current quarter. The timeline for a U.S. approval decision is now far less certain. Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said it was “extremely unlikely that there is an inherent regulatory problem.” He said it was “merely a delay and yet another short term problem that does not inspire Street confidence.”   Upon preliminary review, the FDA determined that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the new drug application are insufficient to permit a complete review, the company said. Celgene said it intends to seek immediate guidance from the FDA to determine what additional information will be required to resubmit the application. “We will work with the FDA to expeditiously address all outstanding items and bring this important medicine to patients,” Jay Backstrom, Celgene’s chief medical officer and head of global regulatory affairs, said in a statement. Wall Street analysts had forecast ozanimod sales of about $263 million in 2019, according to Thomson Reuters data, a figure that will likely have to come down with any significant delay. Annual sales of the drug are projected to reach $3.46 billion by 2024. Ozanimod is also being tested for Crohn’s disease and in combination with Celgene’s psoriasis drug Otezla for ulcerative colitis. Celgene shares were down 7.7 percent at $88.33 in extended trading.

351,CELG,"Dollar rises on Powell's economic outlook, stocks slip","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar rose to five-week highs on Wednesday on the prospect of tighter monetary policy and an upbeat U.S. economic outlook from the Federal Reserve’s new chief, while global equity markets slid on declines by China’s Tencent and Celgene Corp. Also pushing the greenback higher was euro zone inflation slowing to a 14-month low, which knocked the euro to six-week lows and underscored the European Central Bank’s caution in removing monetary stimulus in the region. The dollar in February posted its strongest monthly performance since November 2016 as it also rose to a two-month high against the Canadian dollar and a six-week high against sterling. “The dollar has found tailwinds in America’s sturdy economy and its hawkish central bank,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. The dollar index gained 0.34 percent, with the euro down 0.27 percent to $1.2198. The Japanese yen firmed 0.55 percent versus the greenback at 106.73 per dollar.  Stocks globally snapped a record 15-month winning streak, pulled lower by Chinese conglomerate Tencent Holdings because of its large stake in Singapore-based Sea Ltd, an online gaming and e-commerce firm, and Celgene. Sea posted a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and the departure of its president, who was the public face of its U.S. listing last year. Sea ADR’s fell 10.6 percent in New York. Celgene said late Tuesday that U.S. health regulators rejected its application seeking approval of a key multiple sclerosis drug due to insufficient data. The surprise development will likely delay the entry to market of one of Celgene’s most important pipeline assets. Tencent fell 3.1 percent, the biggest drag on MSCI’s all-country world index, which fell 1.1 percent as Celgene closed down 9 percent.   The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares fell 0.72 percent to close at 1,487.20. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 380.83 points, or 1.5 percent, to 25,029.2. The S&P; 500 lost 30.45 points, or 1.11 percent, to 2,713.83 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 57.35 points, or 0.78 percent, to 7,273.01. Longer-dated U.S. Treasury debt yields slipped on expectations that a faster pace of Federal Reserve interest rate increases would cool U.S. inflation and economic growth. U.S. economic growth slowed slightly more than initially thought in the fourth quarter as the strongest pace of consumer spending in three years drew in imports and depleted inventories. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 11/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.8679 percent.

365,CELG,Wall Street slides as healthcare drags but manages monthly gain,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street fell on Monday as healthcare stocks slid and investors worried about rising costs for companies as oil prices rose, although the major indexes eked out a gain in April to snap a two-month losing streak. The healthcare sector .SPXHC, which dropped 1.6 percent, weighed most heavily on the S&P; 500, as shares of Allergan plc (AGN.N) and Celgene Corp (CELG.O) led the sector’s slide. Some investors suggested that on balance, a strong earnings season has not been enough for U.S. stocks to break out of their recent trading range. “The earnings are priced in,” said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. “There’s not a whole lot of reason to buy. We’re stuck in the mud right now.” Oil prices rallied after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had lied about not pursuing nuclear weapons after signing a 2015 deal with global powers. Even as companies’ quarterly results have come in strong, their earnings calls have raised concerns that rising commodity prices may pinch profit margins in the future. The possibility that temporary exemptions on steel and aluminum tariffs might expire for several U.S. allies also weighed on U.S. stocks. Without an extension from U.S. President Donald Trump, the exemptions will expire on Tuesday. “That might be the most negative (news event) this week,” said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. “It’s not going to be viewed well by the market.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 148.04 points, or 0.61 percent, to 24,163.15, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 21.86 points, or 0.82 percent, to 2,648.05 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 53.53 points, or 0.75 percent, to 7,066.27. For the month, the S&P; 500 rose 0.27 percent, the Dow added 0.25 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.04 percent. Earlier in Monday’s session, U.S. stocks were helped by data on income and spending that kept broader inflation worries in check. U.S. personal income rose 0.3 percent in March, compared with expectations of 0.4 percent. On the consumption side, personal spending growth in February was revised lower to 0.3 percent, instead of the previously reported 0.4 percent. McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) shares jumped 5.8 percent after the world’s biggest fast-food chain by revenue topped analysts’ forecasts for profit and sales. Shares of Allergan fell 5.2 percent after the company’s chief executive said he was opposed to fundamental changes to the drug company’s business strategy. Celgene shares fell 4.5 percent. Morgan Stanley said it expects a delay of up to three years for Celgene’s key multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod. Shares of T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N) sank on worries that the two companies’ $26 billion merger would face regulatory challenges. Sprint shares tumbled 13.7 percent, and T-Mobile shares dropped 6.2 percent. Arconic Inc (ARNC.N) shares fell 20.6 percent after the aluminum products maker slashed its 2018 forecasts. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.74-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.99-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 46 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.81 billion shares, compared to the 6.57 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

367,CELG,Celgene profit tops estimates; clarifies path for key MS drug,"(Reuters) - Celgene Corp (CELG.O) reported much-needed, stronger-than-expected first quarter results as profit and sales of several drugs exceeded Wall Street forecasts, and the U.S. biotechnology company said it would re-apply for approval of an important multiple sclerosis treatment in early 2019. Celgene shares rose as much as 4 percent. A series of clinical setbacks and perceived management missteps took a heavy toll on Celgene shares, which have declined 42 percent since October. Perhaps most embarrassing was the February rejection for insufficient data by U.S. regulators of Celgene’s filing seeking approval of ozanimod, a MS drug seen as critical to lessening reliance on the flagship cancer treatment Revlimid. The company said on Friday it now plans to re-submit the U.S. ozanimod application and apply for European approval in the first quarter of 2019. “We are very confident the regulatory path for ozanimod is understood and back on track,” Chief Executive Mark Alles told analysts. Jefferies analyst Michael Yee called the new plan “good enough” given fears it would be delayed until 2020. Celgene said it expects to file for U.S. approval of fedratinib for myelofibrosis later this year, and for CAR-T therapy JCAR017 for blood cancers in 2019, treatments Celgene gained with recent acquisitions of Impact Biomedicines and Juno Therapeutics. Celgene said it believes the two treatments will help make up for the later than originally expected launch of ozanimod, and it maintained its 2020 revenue targets. For the first quarter, Celgene posted adjusted earnings of $2.05 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 9 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Celgene now expects 2018 revenue at the high end of its  $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion forecast. It sees 2018 adjusted earnings of $8.95 per share, up from its prior view of $8.70 to $8.90. That excludes the cost of the Juno acquisition, which would take full-year adjusted EPS down to about $8.45. Revlimid sales, driven by longer duration of use in multiple myeloma, rose about 19 percent to $2.23 billion, above analysts’ estimates of $2.21 billion. Sales of Otezla for psoriasis surged 46 percent to $353 million, helped by an aggressive U.S. television ad campaign. That also exceeded estimates, as did sales of cancer drugs Pomalyst at $453 million, and Abraxane at $262 million. Revenue rose 19.4 percent to $3.54 billion, topping estimates of $3.46 billion.

369,CELG,CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Celgene tops estimates on higher demand for cancer drug Revlimid,"(Corrects paragraph 10 to say “without dilution from the acquisition of Juno” instead of “including gains from the acquisition of Juno” and paragraph 11 to say “including dilution from Juno” instead of “excluding Juno’s impact”.) * Revlimid, Otezla sales beat estimates * To resubmit ozanimod marketing application earlier than expected * Shares up 1.7 percent before the bell By Akankshita Mukhopadhyay May 4 (Reuters) - Celgene Corp topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Friday and said it expects 2018 revenue at the high end of its forecast, driven by demand for blockbuster myeloma drug Revlimid as well as psoriasis treatment Otezla. The U.S. biotechnology company also said it would re-submit an application to U.S regulators for the approval of its multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod, in the first quarter of 2019, sooner than analysts had expected. While Revlimid has driven much of Celgene’s growth in recent years, analysts view ozanimod as a key drug that can help the company’s efforts to lower its reliance on Revlimid. Those efforts include Celgene’s purchase earlier this year of Juno Therapeutics and Impact Biomedicines, two developers of cancer treatments. Analysts had expected a delay in ozanimod securing U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval after the agency rejected an initial application due to insufficient data in February. The timing of the second application for ozanimod was “good enough” and earlier than expected, considering fears it would be delayed until 2020, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said. Revlimid’s sales rose about 19 percent to $2.23 billion in the first quarter, above analysts’ estimates of $2.21 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, while sales of Otezla surged 46 percent and also topped expectations. Celgene now expects 2018 revenue at the high end of its $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion forecast. Shares of Celgene rose 1.7 percent in premarket trading on Friday. The company expects adjusted earnings for 2018 of about $8.95 per share, without dilution from the acquisition of Juno. Including dilution from Juno, Celgene expects earnings of about $8.45 per share. Its previous forecast was a range of $8.70 to $8.90 per share. Net income fell 9 percent to $846 million. Excluding one-time items, Celgene earned $2.05 per share in the first quarter ended March 31, while analysts were expecting $1.96 per share. Revenue rose 19.4 percent to $3.54 billion, topping estimates of $3.46 billion.
