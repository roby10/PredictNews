1,DUK,"EPA rule aims to cut smog, soot from coal plants","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. environmental regulators finalized a rule on Thursday to slash air pollution from coal-fired power plants in 27 states east of the Rocky Mountains that result in unhealthy levels of smog and soot.  The Environmental Protection Agency measure, known as the Cross State Air Pollution Rule, will add costs for some power generators, but should cut health care bills for Americans.  Companies that could see higher costs include large coal burners Southern Co, Duke Energy and American Electric Power.  “No community should have to bear the burden of another community’s polluters, or be powerless to prevent air pollution that leads to asthma, heart attacks and other harmful illnesses,” said EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson.  The EPA rule will reduce power plant sulfur dioxide emissions by 73 percent by 2014, from 2005 levels, when combined with state environmental laws. It will cut nitrogen oxide emissions by 54 percent by 2014. Those cuts are slightly deeper than ones proposed by the EPA last year.  Power plants have to start cutting their sulfur dioxide emissions in January 2012 and their nitrogen oxide emissions that May.  In addition, the state of Texas will now be required to cut sulfur dioxide emissions in an annual program, a measure that was not included in last year’s proposal.  The agency said the rule would prevent up to 34,000 premature deaths, and save $280 billion per year in health costs. The pollution is linked to heart attacks and lung problems including asthma.  Those benefits outweigh the $800 million projected to be spent by power plants and others annually on the rule in 2014 and the roughly $1.6 billion per year in capital investments already underway from previous rules, the EPA said.  The rule will also level the playing field for power plant operators that are already controlling these emissions by requiring more plants to take similar actions, it said.  Not everyone was happy about the regulation.  “The late decision to apply the rule to Texas and the modeling for the rule have resulted in wholly unreasonable mandates and unrealistic timelines for Texas,” Luminant, a unit of private company Energy Future Holdings, and the biggest power producer in Texas, said in a release.  Shares of Southern Co were down 0.4 percent on Thursday, while Duke Energy and American Electric Power both rose less than 0.5 percent.  The rule resulted from a federal appeals court order instructing the EPA to strengthen a similar regulation issued in 2005 by the  Bush administration.  It is opposed by many Republicans in Congress, who say it will kill jobs and could make transmission of electricity unreliable because it would force companies to shut some of their coal plants.  But the argument that the rule will hurt transmission is a “red herring” because plants integral to power delivery would not be allowed to shut down, said Susan Tierney, a managing principal at the Analysis Group, an organization of economic and financial consultants.  She said only the oldest, least efficient and smaller coal plants would be shut as a result of rules to be issued this year by the EPA on power plants.  Environmentalists praised the EPA. The Clean Air Task Force said the rule was a “solid victory for clean air and public health.”  The EPA will take public comment for 45 days on a supplemental rule that would require six states — Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Oklahoma and Wisconsin — to reduce nitrogen oxide pollution in the summer months. That rule is expected to be finalized late this year.  ",7072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-smog/epa-rule-aims-to-cut-smog-soot-from-coal-plants-idUSTRE7664GD20110707

3,DUK,FACTBOX-U.S. proposed new nuclear power reactors," July 13 (Reuters) - The U.S. nuclear industry’s top cop is to weigh major changes in how it regulates the country’s 104 reactors after Japan’s Fukushima disaster, a move that will help shape the future of the power source and could lead to significant cost increases.  A task force recommended the Nuclear Regulatory Commission look at a fundamental shift in how it plans for catastrophes like the earthquake and tsunami that swamped the Fukushima plant in March, the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 25 years.  Now it is up to the five-member commission to decide which ideas to accept and how quickly to proceed in an industry where plant retrofits can run into the millions. [ID:nN1E76C0KV]  The task force praised new reactors that include passive features, saying the new designs would be in line with many of its recommendations. It urged the NRC to complete its review “without delay” of Toshiba-Shaw’s Westinghouse AP1000 reactor and GE-Hitachi’s Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR). [ID:nN1E76B22X]  The AP1000 is the reactor design of choice for the nation’s first new nuclear plants in 30 years — Southern in Georgia and SCANA in South Carolina.

6,DUK,Santee Cooper finds 3rd partner for new nuclear plant," HOUSTON, July 22 (Reuters) - South Carolina’s state-owned electric utility on Friday said it signed a letter of intent with a third potential partner that wants to buy power from two new nuclear reactors to be built later this decade.  The Florida Municipal Power Agency, a wholesale power company whose members supply electricity to 2 million Florida residents, is interested in taking from 2 percent to 10 percent of the output of the new 1,100-megawatt units under development at the Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina.  Summer units 2 and 3 are among the first advanced-design nuclear reactors to be built in the United States in more than 30 years.  South Carolina power company Scana (SCG.N) and Santee Cooper have started preparing the site in Fairfield County, South Carolina, for two new Westinghouse AP1000 reactors while they wait for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue a construction and operating license.  Santee Cooper owns 45 percent of the new reactors and Scana owns the other 55 percent. The expansion will cost about $10.5 billion. The new Summer units are expected to enter service in 2016 and 2019.  Santee Cooper is working to attract other partners to buy output or take minority stakes in the new reactors’ after the recession slowed the state’s electric growth projections. Santee Cooper wants to cut its stake in the plant to about 20 percent.  No financial terms were discussed.  Earlier this week, Santee Cooper signed a letter of intent with Duke Energy (DUK.N) for 5 to 10 percent of the new reactors. [ID:nN1E76JOR9]  In March, Santee Cooper signed a letter of intent with the Orlando Utilities Commission of Florida for 5 to 10 percent of the output of the new reactors.  Depending on the final outcome of the three agreements, Santee Cooper appears to have reached its goal of halving its take of the new reactors’ output.  A Santee Cooper spokeswoman said the company has no timetable to complete the selldown of stake in Summer.  The NRC will likely approve of the Westinghouse AP1000 design later this year before issuing the construction and operating license for the Summer reactors by the end of the year or early in 2012, Santee Cooper has said.  Westinghouse Electric is majority owned by Japanese multinational conglomerate Toshiba (6502.T) and U.S. construction and engineering firm Shaw Group SHAW.N.

Strong performance from Duke’s international business and U.S. gas power plants in the wholesale markets helped offset higher costs to repair storm damage, which totaled $50 million in the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Lynn Good told Reuters on Tuesday.   Duke’s utility operations saw solid residential demand in the quarter and growth in industrial customers’ usage in the Carolinas, although the U.S. Midwest industrial sector’s demand was soft.   “There continues to be a lot of volatility quarter to quarter in the (economic) growth,” Good said. “It’s hard to be much more than cautious.”   Net income was $435 million, or 33 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $222 million, or 17 cents per share, that included a charge to write down the value of some power plants.   That topped the 31 cents per share that analysts on average had forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Revenue rose 8 percent to $3.53 billion, while analysts had forecast $3.31 billion.   Duke is currently seeking regulatory approvals for its planned $13.7 billion purchase of Progress Energy PGN.N, a deal that will create the nation’s largest utility owner.   Entergy said its finalized second-quarter profit was $315.6 million, or $1.76 per share, from $315.3 million, or $1.71 per share, the year-ago quarter.   That EPS figure was 1 cent higher than the preliminary earnings figure the company issued two weeks ago, and increased from the year-ago mark because of higher-than-expected share repurchases.   “The company ended the quarter with 177 (million) shares outstanding which is below its guidance of 180 (million) for the year,”  Marc de Croisset, analyst with FBR Capital Markets, said in a note to investors.   Entergy, the second-largest nuclear power plant operator in the united States behind Exelon Corp (EXC.N), is currently locked in a battle with Vermont to extend the life of its Vermont Yankee nuclear plant to 2032.

11,DUK,"Analysis: Republicans turn sights on ""activist"" EPA","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Emboldened by their success wresting concessions from the Obama administration in debt-limit talks, House Republicans now plan an assault of similar vigor on the Environmental Protection Agency.  Republicans, backed by wealthy conservative lobbyists, are determined to stop the EPA and what they see as an activist agenda that is costing jobs and hurting corporate profits.  “Right now for House Republicans one of their important rally cries is that EPA regulations are excessive and even abusive,” said Robert Stavins, director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program.  After President Barack Obama’s push for a climate bill in Congress collapsed last year, the EPA was left as the last bastion of hope for his environmental policy.  This led the agency, ironically founded under the Republican administration of Richard Nixon in 1970, to pursue its environmental agenda vigorously. The EPA was considered a toothless tiger under the administration of George W. Bush.  Almost on par with government spending, Republicans galvanized around the issue, using every opportunity, such as congressional hearings, relentlessly to criticize EPA chief Lisa Jackson and stymie her agency’s efforts.  While Republicans face stiff opposition in any legislation to shackle the EPA from the Democrat-controlled Senate and the White House, they do have a number of options, especially in the run-up to the 2012 elections.  And the party has proven adept at outflanking the often disunited Democrats on big issues.  House Republicans could move to cut EPA funding through the appropriations process or through deficit-cutting talks in November as required by the debt-ceiling agreement.  Representative Fred Upton, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, was picked by Republicans to be part of the 12-member congressional committee that will decide on cuts needed as part of the debt-ceiling agreement.  He could push hard for savings from the EPA’s budget as he has led the battle against its rules.  Senate Majority leader Harry Reid recently said he sees no threat to the EPA from Upton’s presence on the super-committee.  “I would assume they will make a serious effort to cut back and apply pressure to cut back EPA regulatory activity as part of this budgetary process,” Stavins said.  “I don’t know if they’ll succeed. That will depend on what the Democratic response to that is.”  Representative Ed Whitfield, another leading Republican on energy policy issues, said that outside the debt talks his party will hammer away in hearings and through legislation on its themes that the EPA has been killing jobs and growth.  Whitfield said Democrats, especially those from energy-intensive states such as West Virginia and Ohio, should know it will be a major issue on the campaign trail.  “We want to keep passing things on the House side that would reverse things EPA is doing simply because we’d like to see those 23 Democratic senators up for reelection next year vote on some of this,” Whitfield said.  Of the most contentious proposals, the EPA wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the country’s major utilities. But the process has been delayed, in part, some suspect, by Republican pressure.  These rules could hit the bottom lines of such companies as American Electric Power and Duke Energy. Similar regulations are also planned for oil refineries.  In addition, the EPA has been struggling to complete a much-delayed rule on ozone pollution while also pushing new fuel-efficiency standards and measures to cut emissions from oil and gas drilling.  In protest, states and industry groups have slapped the EPA with multiple lawsuits, which could delay implementation of its rules and slow investment in energy-dependent industries.  Republicans have tried a number of legislative moves to hamper the EPA. In April, the House passed a bill designed as a blanket ban on the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions and sent it to the Senate, which voted 50-50 on it, falling short of the super-majority needed.  The House Interior-EPA spending bill introduced last month to cut funding to EPA programs is also pending.  Whitfield, the House Republican, said his party could use a continuing resolution or omnibus bill to staunch the flow of funds from Congress.  A continuing resolution could paralyze the EPA by cutting its current and future spending. Slipping EPA program cuts into a larger budgetary package essential to running the government could be a strategy to force Republican demands into law.  Anti-EPA lobbyists have also been at work. Steve Miller, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, said his group is pushing hard to persuade Democrats in both chambers to fall in line with Republicans.  Miller said EPA rules regulating air pollution from utilities “would be the most expensive regulation to ever affect our coal-based electricity industry”.  Environmentalists are hopeful that Democrats in the Senate and the threat of a veto from the White House will be able to stop the assault on the country’s environmental laws.  “I think it’s important to know that for all of the saber rattling, nothing of substance has passed Congress,” Jigar Shah, CEO of the environmental nonprofit Carbon War Room, said.

15,DUK,Insight: Showdown looms on U.S. overseas profit tax break,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Backed by powerful companies spending millions of dollars, Washington lobbyists are fighting in the marble corridors of Congress for a tax break on $1.5 trillion in profits held overseas to escape the U.S. tax man.  When lawmakers return next month from summer break, powerful high-tech and pharmaceutical companies will step up their push for an overseas profit tax repatriation holiday and pose a test for President Barack Obama. (For a graphic please click on r.reuters.com/fuj43s)  The idea has been kicking around for months, gaining only limited traction, but supporters sense their moment may be near, with the economy sluggish and Obama searching for new ways to ignite business investment and create jobs.  A repatriation tax holiday offers just that, advocates say, although critics contend the proposal’s promises of economic stimulus are illusory and serve only to mask a tax break costing the United States $80 billion over 10 years.  The White House, so far, has stood firm against a holiday, refusing to consider it outside the context of making broad changes in the convoluted tax code.  That stance could be strained as the November 2012 elections near with 9.1 percent of Americans unemployed and Obama courting corporate support for his reelection campaign.  “As this economy continues to struggle, I think our case gets stronger every day,” said Republican Representative Kevin Brady, author of a repatriation tax holiday bill backed by 15 Republicans and eight Democrats in the House of Representatives.  “Lowering that tax rate for a year to bring those dollars home, people don’t understand why we’re not doing that. Some may view it as a tax break, but others just see these stranded profits that could do a lot of good things,” Brady said.  No Senate bill has emerged, but Democratic Senator Kay Hagan is considering one, her spokeswoman said.  “Repatriation is on the table,” said Chris Krueger, policy analyst at investment firm MF Global.  Like most analysts, however, he said a new 12-member “super committee” being formed to tackle the federal deficit likely will not embrace a tax holiday, as promoted by a corporate lobbying group called the WIN America campaign.  The main reason? The White House and other Democratic opponents want to use it as leverage as long as they can to gain concessions from corporations on other tax reform issues.  “Repatriation ... is an important bargaining lever - not one to be given away easily by lawmakers,” he said.  Congress still feels burned by the last repatriation tax holiday. Approved in 2004 with the backing of President George W. Bush, that tax break did little to boost the economy, despite promises of job-creating investment.  Democratic Representative Lloyd Doggett said another such corporate give-away would simply be a mistake.  “The tax holiday promoted by the WIN America coalition is a real loser for hardworking Americans,” Doggett told Reuters.  “It didn’t create jobs last time and ... multinational corporations have no intention of using this repatriation tax windfall to create jobs. A bargain tax rate on foreign profits, many hidden in tax havens, would be an incentive for job creation abroad and even more layoffs at home.”  The repatriation tax holiday fight opens a window into the game of writing tax law in Washington and the tightly knit group of politicians and lobbyists who play it.  * Duke Energy Corp CEO Jim Rogers, a Southerner with ties to Democrats, is a frequent public speaker for WIN America, advocating for the tax holiday. Rogers led a fund-raising committee to bring the 2012 Democratic National Convention to Charlotte, North Carolina, where Duke is based. The company guaranteed a $10 million line of credit for the event.  * On a more private level, lobbyists and aides said, Oracle President Safra Catz and Cisco Systems Inc CEO John Chambers — both leaders of California high-tech giants — have met lawmakers to talk up the WIN America cause. Besides Oracle and Cisco, two other WIN America supporters are Apple Inc and Google Inc. Employees of all four of these firms have been generous Obama supporters, altogether donating $1.3 million to his 2008 campaign, according to Sunlight, according to the Sunlight Foundation, a good government watchdog group.  * WIN America has hired dozens of former staffers of congressional tax writing panels, according to Sunlight.  Ex-Congressman Jim McCrery, once the top Republican on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, is lobbying for the group. So is Jeff Forbes, former chief of staff to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a key player. Baucus played a central role in killing the last attempt to get a repatriation tax holiday approved. He stood firmly against an amendment offered in 2009 by fellow Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer. It failed in a 55-42 vote.  The stance taken by Baucus — a member of the new deficit “super committee” — will be crucial this time around for WIN America and its allies, said aides and lobbyists. A Senate Finance Committee aide said only that Baucus “is examining proposals in the context of comprehensive tax reform and the forthcoming deficit reduction efforts.”  Nearly everyone on both sides of the repatriation debate agrees that the tax code, especially the part of it dealing with overseas corporate profits, needs an overhaul.  “The way we tax our multinationals is broken,” said Duke Senior Vice President for Tax Keith Butler in an interview, adding that Duke’s corporate tax return is 10,000 pages long.  But like other executives backing WIN America, Butler said tax reform will take too long and repatriation is needed now.  “Repatriation would really boost and help the United States now ... We can’t wait the two or three years that tax reform might take to get these funds back in the U.S.,” he said.  The tale of the overseas profits at stake reaches around the world, from the Paranapanema River in southern Brazil where Duke has a string of hydroelectric dams to a prim office park in Dublin that is home to the Irish subsidiary of Oracle.  Foreign operations like these have generated, in legal ways, an estimated $1.5 trillion in overseas corporate income for U.S. corporations on which no U.S. corporate income tax is paid as long as the funds stay abroad.  The U.S. corporate income tax rate is 35 percent. Profits earned at home in the United States are taxed right away at that rate, though other corporate tax breaks frequently allow large companies to pay a much lower effective rate.  Income earned abroad is a different story. In most cases, taxes on these profits may be deferred. As a result, some global firms have an incentive to put as much income as they can in foreign subsidiaries located in low-tax countries.  When U.S. companies do repatriate overseas profits, they are taxed at the 35-percent rate, minus credits for taxes already paid to their foreign subsidiaries’ host countries.  On profits that are not repatriated, only the host-country tax must be paid and U.S. corporate income tax is avoided. The trouble is that, over the years, unrepatriated overseas profits pile up. And analysts say that is no accident.  Credit Suisse estimated in April that S&P 500 companies at the end of 2010 had $1.3 trillion overseas.  Perhaps encouraged by Bush’s 2004 repatriation holiday, companies may park profits intentionally abroad “with the hopes of a future tax holiday,” Credit Suisse analysts said.  Congressman Brady’s legislation proposes a tax holiday that would let companies repatriate their overseas profits at the bargain-basement tax rate of 5.25 percent, the same rate adopted under Bush’s 2004 program.  In 2004 and 2005, 843 corporations brought into the United States almost $362 billion from abroad, according to a 2008 Internal Revenue Service analysis.  Those repatriations “did not lead to an increase in domestic investment, employment or R&D — even for firms that lobbied for the tax holiday stating these intentions,” said a 2009 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research.  Most of the money brought back six years ago went to shareholder dividends and stock buybacks, NBER found.  Strictures on the use of the repatriated funds were written into the 2004 measure, but the NBER study showed that companies found ways to get around them.  Brady’s bill would penalize companies that cut their staffs after the repatriation holiday.  The Joint Committee on Taxation, a non-partisan congressional research arm, estimated that a tax holiday similar to Brady’s would initially boost U.S. tax revenues as profits entered the country, but would eventually cost taxpayers about $78.7 billion over the next decade.  Critics said the Brady measure would likely work no better than the 2004 law did at ensuring job-creating investment, and that it would only encourage “accumulate to repatriate” overseas tax strategies by U.S. corporations.

16,DUK,TEXT-Fitch rates Progress Carolina's $500MM FMBs 'A+'; otlk stbl," (The following statement was released by the rating agency)	   Sept 13 - Fitch Ratings assigns a rating of ‘A+’ to the $500 million of 3.00% first mortgage bonds issued by Carolina Power & Light Company d/b/a Progress Energy Carolinas, Inc. (PEC). The bonds will mature Sept. 15, 2021. The new bonds are secured by a lien of mortgage and rank equally with PEC’s other first mortgage bonds. Proceeds from the bonds will be used to repay short-term debt, which totaled approximately $178 million as of Aug. 31, 2011, and the balance for general corporate purposes, including construction expenditures. The Rating Outlook is Stable.	   Strong Financial Position and Supportive Regulation: PEC’s ratings reflect its financial position and supportive state regulation. PEC’s cash flows are stabilized and lag is minimized via annually reset clauses for recovery of fuel; certain purchased power energy and capacity; demand-side management; energy efficiency; and certain renewables costs.	   Parent Support: PEC’s ratings also consider the upstream dividend payments to parent, Progress Energy, Inc . (IDR ‘BBB’/Outlook Stable by Fitch), needed to help support the substantial holding company debt.	   Strong Credit Ratios: While helped by favorable weather, PEC’s funds from operation (FFO) interest coverage ratio exceeded 8 times (x) in 2010. Fitch anticipates that PEC’s credit metrics will remain strong relative to rating guidelines over the next couple of years, but will be less robust than 2010 metrics due to challenging weather comparisons, recovery lag for investments in new generation units, and other system improvements.	   Capital Program Execution Risk: Fitch’s rating concerns center on execution risk and timely cost recovery for the fleet modernization plan to retire older coal units and replace the capacity with several new gas-fired combined cycle combustion turbine (CCGT) units. In addition, sales to commercial and residential customers are still under pressure.	   Rating Outlook Stable: The Stable Outlook assumes PEC will obtain base rate relief in mid-2013. The Stable Rating Outlook also assumes no significant rate credits or prolonged rate freezes associated with North Carolina and South Carolina state approvals of the Duke Energy merger.

20,DUK,EPA regs may force Duke to shut Indiana coal plant," * 668-MW Wabash River plant may shut by 2014   * Duke Edwardsport IGCC about 95 pct complete   NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - North Carolina-based energy company Duke Energy (DUK.N) said Tuesday it could retire the 668-megawatt Wabash River coal-fired power plant in Indiana due to proposed federal environmental regulations.   “We have not made a final decision. It depends on the final version of the federal Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) rule,” Duke spokeswoman Angeline Protogere told Reuters.   Depending on the final rule, which is expected in November, Protogere said Duke could retire Units 2, 3, 4 and 5 and possibly also Unit 6 at the plant by 2014.   The six unit station was completed between 1953 and 1968. Duke owns Units 2-6.   Duke does not own Unit 1, which is part of 260-MW Wabash River gasification project, owned by Wabash Valley Association.   Protogere said any decision by Duke would only affect the five Wabash units the company owns.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed the Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) rule in March 2011 and is expected to issue a final rule in November.   In its current form, energy companies would have three years until November 2014 to comply. Although there is a possibility of a one-year extension.   The HAP rule would reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants, like mercury, hydrogen chloride and particulate matter, from new and existing coal and oil-fired power plants based on Maximum Available Control Technology (MACT).   The proposed HAP rule replaces the Clean Air Mercury Rule vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court in 2008 and could affect about 1,350 coal and oil fired units at some 525 power plants, which represent about 24 percent of the nation’s generation, according to a report on Ohio-based energy company American Electric Power’s (AEP.N) website.   Several states, regional power grid operators and Republican U.S. Congressmen have urged the EPA and the Obama administration to reconsider the HAP and other proposed environmental regulations because the rules could threaten the reliability of the power grid and boost electricity prices.   Environmental groups and energy companies with clean natural gas, nuclear and renewable generating fleets, however, have argued the EPA should not delay its rule making because there was enough “clean” but little used generation available to replace any coal-fired plants that have to shut.   Duke’s Protogere also said the company planned to retire or convert to natural gas two units at the four unit 560-MW Gallagher coal power plant in Indiana.   She said the changes at Gallagher had nothing to do with the current round of proposed EPA regulations but were the result of past federal litigation.   Duke is also interested in buying an interest in an existing natural gas power plant in Vermillion County, Indiana.   And, Protogere said work on the 618-MW Edwardsport integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) clean coal plant in Indiana was about 95 percent complete. On its website, Duke said the Edwardsport plant, which cost an estimated $2.88 billion, should enter service in 2012.

21,DUK,"Duke, Progress say can meet regulators' terms for merger","WILMINGTON, NC. (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N) and Progress Energy Inc PGN.N are confident they can meet conditions set by federal regulators and close their proposed merger by the end of the year, the companies said on Monday.  A ruling late on Friday by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) conditionally authorized the proposed merger, a $13.7 billion deal that will create the United States’ largest electric utility.  In a joint statement, the two companies said they planned to file detailed measures within about two weeks to address the FERC’s concerns about the adverse effect the combined company could have on the power markets in North and South Carolina.  Progress Energy spokesman Mike Hughes said the companies expect to respond well ahead of FERC’s 60-day deadline “to keep the process moving” so the merger can be closed by year-end.  Analysts said they were skeptical about what they called the companies’ “positive spin” on the FERC ruling. The ruling concurred with eastern North Carolina municipal utilities which contend the two companies already have too much market control over wholesale power supplies to local utilities.  The merger, these utilities told FERC, would consolidate that market power and leave the new Duke with unfair market dominance.  Calling FERC’s conditions “potentially troublesome,” Gimme Credit analyst Philip Adams said possible solutions to this might include selling power plants, building additional transmission lines, or turning over control of their transmission system to an independent system operator.  Independent transmission control is “possibly FERC’s ulterior motive,” Adams said.  Adams said anything proposed will almost certainly change the economics of the merger, and might require additional hearings before the utilities commission in North Carolina, which concluded its hearings on the merger on September 22.  In January, Duke proposed buying Progress Energy for $13.7 billion in cash, in addition to assuming more than $12 billion in debt.  The companies say the merger will create the largest U.S. electric utility with more than 7.1 million electric customers in six states — North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky— and the largest regulated nuclear fleet in the country. The merged company will retain the Duke Energy name.

23,DUK,Pennsylvania wind farm stops working nights to protect bats,"PITTSBURGH (Reuters) - A Pennsylvania wind farm has stopped operating at night after the carcass of an endangered bat was found at the site last month, a spokesman for the wind farm’s owner said on Tuesday. The carcass of the Indiana bat was discovered on September 26 at the North Allegheny Windpower Project, which includes 35 turbines straddling two counties, said Greg Efthimiou, a spokesman for North Carolina-based Duke Energy. The company summoned an expert who confirmed the animal found was an Indiana bat and contacted wildlife officials as part of a voluntary environmental monitoring program, he said. Duke Energy stopped operating the wind farm at night “to prevent additional mortalities of Indiana bats,” Efthimiou said. Indiana bats, found in the eastern United States, have been listed as endangered since 1967 and continue to be threatened by hibernation site disturbance by people, loss of summer habitat and a bat disease, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The company is working with the Fish and Wildlife Service and the state Game Commission to find ways to reduce the risk to the bats in keeping with the federal Endangered Species Act, the service said in a statement. It remained unclear when the wind farm may resume nightly operation of the turbines, but the company was taking into consideration the migratory season of the bats, which ends in mid-November when the bats go into hibernation, Efthimiou said. The 70-megawatt wind farm in Western Pennsylvania was built by Gamesa Energy USA and began operating in September 2009. It was acquired earlier that year by Duke Energy Renewables, a Duke Energy subsidiary.

Duke submitted a proposal last month to U.S. regulators to address fears that the planned merger would give the combined company too much market power, and it has asked for a ruling by Dec. 15. “Our aspiration is to get an order from the (Federal Energy Regulatory) Commission and the (Carolinas’) commissions so that we can close by year-end because from an accounting standpoint that’s the best answer. But it’s really out of our hands in terms of when they will act,” Chairman and Chief Executive James Rogers told Reuters. The proposed $13.7 billion purchase of Progress would make the company the largest U.S. electric utility with 7.1 million electric customers in six states. Duke’s third-quarter net profit fell to $472 million, or 35 cents per share, from $666 million, or 51 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding special items, it earned 50 cents per share. On that basis, analysts had expected 46 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s fleet of nuclear power plants operated at 99.27 percent of its output capacity during the quarter, and its natural gas-fired plants saw strong demand in key markets. Operating revenue rose marginally to $3.96 billion. Citing its performance year to date, Duke raised its adjusted earnings forecast for the year to $1.40 to $1.45 per share from $1.35 to $1.40 per share earlier. The company took a $220 million charge related to the construction of its Edwardsport, Indiana, power plant, which will come on line next year and will be one of the world’s cleanest coal-fired power stations.

Progress Energy told Reuters on Thursday that its merger with Duke Energy would not occur by the year-end, as the two companies had previously expected. “Obviously we were surprised by it,” Progress Energy spokesman Mike Hughes said. “We’re still evaluating the order to understand what it means.

It remains conditionally authorized by FERC. The companies may offer another mitigation proposal that addresses FERC’s concerns,” the FERC said. FERC has raised concerns about the merger’s impact on power markets in North and South Carolina. The worry is that the companies have too much market control over wholesale power supplies to local utilities in the Carolinas where both companies are based. The companies submitted a virtual divestiture plan to the FERC in October under which Duke and Progress utilities in the Carolinas will sell 800 megawatt (MW) of wholesale power during the summer and 225 MW in the winter months to local load-serving entities at cost-based rates. “Although Duke and Progress describe the proposal as a virtual divestiture, it would not transfer control of the energy the applicants propose to sell from the merged company,” FERC said.

39,DUK,North Carolina may hand setback to gay marriage push,"* Polls show gay marriage ban has good chance of passing * Bank of America, Duke Energy executives oppose ban By Wade Rawlins RALEIGH, N.C., May 5 (Reuters) - Efforts to legalize gay marriage have met success in several U.S. states this year but could experience a setback on Tuesday if North Carolina voters decide to amend the state constitution to ban same-sex marriages and civil unions. Same-sex marriage is illegal in North Carolina. But the state has stood out as the only one in the Southeast that has not passed a constitutional amendment solidifying such a ban. Supporters of the proposed amendment say it would preserve the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman and make laws outlawing gay marriage harder to repeal. Opponents say a ban would jeopardize health insurance benefits for unmarried gay and heterosexual couples and signal that the state is unfriendly to a diverse workforce. The primary ballot measure has attracted wide attention ahead of the Democratic National Convention planned for early September in Charlotte, North Carolina, a swing state in the Nov. 6 presidential election. President Barack Obama’s campaign issued a statement saying he had long opposed divisive and discriminatory efforts to deny benefits to same-sex couples and opposed the amendment. Mitt Romney, the presumed Republican nominee, is opposed to gay marriage. Recent polling shows the proposed amendment stands a good chance of passing. In a survey of 982 likely primary voters, conducted from April 27 to 29 by the Raleigh-based Public Policy Polling firm, 55 percent of those questioned supported the amendment banning same-sex marriage while 41 percent opposed it. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percent. “North Carolina is still a conservative, church-going state,” said Gary Pearce, a longtime Democratic political consultant. “Particularly among older voters, there is discomfort with gay marriage. I’m not optimistic.” Twenty-eight states have voter-approved constitutional bans on same-sex marriages, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The most recent states to put ballot amendments before voters were California, Arizona and Florida, which passed same-sex marriage bans in November 2008. California’s restriction was later ruled invalid by a federal court. Massachusetts, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, New York and the District of Columbia allow gay and lesbian nuptials. Maryland, New Jersey and Washington state passed laws this year approving same-sex marriage. Governor Chris Christie vetoed New Jersey’s law. In North Carolina, Democrats controlled at least one chamber of the state legislature for decades and sidetracked efforts by supporters of gay marriage bans to put the issue before voters. After Republicans took power in January 2011, the legislature voted to put the proposed amendment on the primary ballot. The language provides that marriage between a man and a woman is the only legally recognized domestic union. Vote For Marriage NC, which has raised $1.1 million to help pass the amendment and has the backing of several prominent religious groups, has released newspaper ads featuring the Reverend Billy Graham. The prominent Christian evangelist, who lives in the North Carolina mountains, is urging voters to support the measure. “At 93, I never thought we would have to debate the definition of marriage,” Graham said in a statement. “The Bible is clear - God’s definition of marriage is between a man and a woman.” But some Christian clergy have expressed opposition, saying the amendment favors one definition of marriage at the expense of all others. The Coalition to Protect North Carolina Families has raised $2.2 million aimed at defeating the amendment, and the state’s chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has run ads likening the ballot measure to a civil rights issue. “We should never seek to codify or vote discrimination into the very heart and framework of our Constitution,” said the Reverend William J. Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP. Critics of the amendment say its wording prohibiting “domestic legal unions” could prevent courts from enforcing private agreements between unmarried couples and invalidate their domestic violence protections - an assertion that some law enforcement officials have dismissed. Courts would likely have to decide the reach of the amendment. The North Carolina Chamber of Commerce has remained silent on the issue. But executives at two of the largest companies headquartered in the state, Bank of America and Duke Energy, have spoken out strongly against the measure. Cathy Bessant, global technology and operations executive at Bank of America, said the best way for North Carolina to compete for new business was to be progressive and forward-looking. In an open letter to state lawmakers, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes recalled feeling unwelcome as a young gay man growing up in North Carolina and s a id the proposed amendment created a bad national image for the state. “Companies like Facebook, Google and Apple are the future of our global economy,” Hughes said in the letter. “But the proposed anti-gay constitutional amendment signals to these and other major employers as well as their mobile, educated employees that North Carolina does not welcome the diverse workforce that any state needs to compete.” With the Republican presidential nomination all but decided and a contested Democratic gubernatorial race on the ballot, the makeup of voters in Tuesday’s primary election is likely to have an effect on the amendment’s fate. As of Wednesday, registered Democrats had cast 46 percent of the early votes, compared to 33 percent cast by registered Republicans and 20 percent by unaffiliated voters. Early voting was running near the record levels of the 2008 primary, said Gary Bartlett, director of the State Board of Elections. Nationally, opposition to gay marriage has waned in the last decade and the public is now about evenly split, according to a 2012 poll by the Pew Research Center. The survey showed 47 percent of Americans favor allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry while 43 percent are opposed. Attitudes are shifting with the generational change, Pearce said. Whether or not North Carolina voters pass the amendment on Tuesday, the political consultant predicted, “In a couple of generations, they’ll look back and say, ‘What was all that about?’”",5052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-campaign-northcarolina-gays/north-carolina-may-hand-setback-to-gay-marriage-push-idUSL1E8G3N9N20120505

42,DUK,"Southern, Duke push US coal gasification; others quit","* Gasification seen preserving coal as electric fuel * Technology challenged by costly construction, cheap gas * Duke IGCC project to raise Indiana rates 14 percent By Eileen O’Grady HOUSTON, June 12 (Reuters) - Only two U.S. electric utilities are building expensive coal-gasification power plants, while dozens of similar facilities have been scrapped and some remaining projects may eliminate coal in favor of abundant, cheap natural gas. Duke Energy’s 618-megawatt Edwardsport coal project in Indiana and Southern Co’s 582-MW Kemper County project in Mississippi are the only “integrated gasification combined cycle”, or IGCC plants, under construction out of more than three dozen proposed in the United States over the last decade. Of the handful of other IGCC projects still in development, two are looking at switching to gas as the primary fuel and dropping coal — at least for now. The power industry cited gasification technology as a way to save coal’s role as the dominant fuel in electric generation as federal limits on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions appeared imminent, but the technology was unable to gain traction in the face of high capital costs, carbon legislation delay and rising supplies of natural gas. IGCC plants face a “host of issues”, starting with high construction costs, said Gary Stiegel, director of major projects at the Energy Department’s National Energy Technology Laboratory, which supports clean-coal technology. With only two plants being built, Duke and Southern “need to show that they are able to start up and achieve their production capacity within a reasonable time,” Stiegel said. IGCC technology employs a chemical process that converts coal into a synthesis gas, using steam and pressure. The so-called “syngas” can be stripped of impurities, then burned in a gas turbine to produce electricity. IGCC also offers the ability to capture emissions — such as heat-trapping CO2 — for storage or other use. The Environmental Protection Agency in March proposed its first rules to reduce CO2 from future coal-fired plants by requiring them to capture and store emissions. “That will add additional expense to these projects,” Stiegel said. High construction costs and technical glitches dogged the nation’s first three IGCC projects in the 1990s. Only two still run: TECO Energy’s 250-megawatt Polk County IGCC in Florida and the 260-MW Wabash River Power Station in Indiana, operated by Duke. As prospects dimmed for carbon legislation, gas prices declined while shale production rose and recession eroded the need for new generation, many of the nearly 20,000 MW of proposed IGCCs were abandoned with little fanfare. American Electric Power, which once touted IGCC as a “critical” technology for the nation, is no longer pursuing an ambitious plan to build three IGCC plants in the Midwest. NRG Energy, Xcel Energy, ConocoPhillips  and a utility owned by Berkshire Hathaway’s  MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co have also dropped IGCC plans. Even TECO and Southern backed away from developing larger IGCC projects in Florida as coal fell out of favor there. In 2008, after a long site-selection process, FutureGen, the industry’s showcase IGCC plant featuring carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), lost Energy Department financial support due to soaring cost estimates. A revised FutureGen 2.0 project will not include coal gasification. Now, the lowest gas prices in a decade make it even harder for companies to justify IGCC’s costs for the ratepayers that must pay the tab. “One challenge to moving this type of project forward is capital costs,” Stiegel said. “Another big issue is getting financing. They are expensive and not many IGCCs have been built, so the financial markets are concerned.” Duke’s Edwardsport IGCC project is expected to produce power by year-end. Cost overruns have boosted its price tag to $3.3 billion from early estimates of less than $2 billion. Under a settlement proposed to satisfy consumer groups, Duke’s Indiana customers will pay just 79 percent of Edwardsport’s price tag. That will limit the rate increase on Duke’s 790,000 customers in Indiana to 14.5 percent, down from 22 percent without the settlement, the utility said. Construction at the IGCC project run by Southern’s Mississippi Power Co continues despite an ongoing legal challenge by the Sierra Club. After initially capping Kemper’s cost at $2.4 billion, a divided Mississippi Public Service Commission raised the amount that the utility can recover from its 190,000 customers to a maximum of $2.88 billion. In the most recent monthly update, Mississippi Power said it had spent or committed $1.5 billion to the Kemper project, which was running $366 million over the initial budget. Southern also disclosed a $1.7 million consulting contract with Anthony Topazi, the former Mississippi Power president whom Southern credits for obtaining state approval of Kemper. Topazi, 62, who was promoted to chief operating officer at the parent company two months after regulators initially approved Kemper, said he will retire on Aug. 1. Expected to be operational in 2014, the Kemper County IGCC plant will showcase technology developed by another Southern unit, along with KBR Inc and the DOE, called Transport Integrated Gasification, or TRIG, which can be used to gasify lower-quality coal such as the lignite in Mississippi. In 2009, Southern licensed the TRIG technology to a Chinese utility. KBR presentations say the technology has “huge potential” in China, India, Australia and Indonesia, countries with large supplies of lower-quality coal. Meanwhile, a handful of IGCC projects remain active, but some have decided to join the natural gas trend, rather than buck it. Calgary-based EmberClear will use gas, rather than coal, to fuel its 300-MW Good Spring plant in northeastern Pennsylvania, dropping the IGCC component for now. “Lack of regulatory clarity on emissions for coal-based electricity plants plus the immediate availability of natural gas provides a strong incentive to use natural gas as the primary fuel source,” EmberClear said in a release. “This modification lowers the project complexity, reduces the capital cost by at least 60 percent and accelerates the construction schedule.” Tenaska, which has been working to develop the Taylorville IGCC project in Illinois for several years, may build a gas-fired power plant and defer the gasification component, the Nebraska-based independent power producer said. “The concept would be to wait until a subsequent legislative approval after economic conditions for gasification improve,” said Bart Ford, Tenaska’s vice president for development. Other active IGCC projects include Summit Energy’s 400-MW Texas Clean Energy project, Hydrogen Energy California in Kern County and ERORA’s 770-MW Cash Creek IGCC in Kentucky.",6122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-coal-gasification/southern-duke-push-us-coal-gasification-others-quit-idUSL1E8H78P420120612

45,DUK,"Progress CEO quits, Duke chief to run combined company","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp, which closed its $18 billion buyout of Progress Energy this week, said Progress Chief Executive Bill Johnson had resigned and would not be taking the top job at the combined company as had been planned. Duke CEO Jim Rogers, 64, has become president and CEO of the combined entity, while remaining chairman, the company said on Tuesday. Rogers said in an interview that he had been officially notified of his new role after board deliberations on Monday afternoon. “I have done two combinations before. The first focus must be on bringing the companies together and empowering the leaders to move forward, capture the synergies and make sure at the same time we continue to provide affordable and reliable service,” Rogers said. Duke said Johnson’s resignation was by “mutual agreement.” Johnson, 58, could not be reached for comment. The company and its lead director, Ann Maynard Gray, declined to give any further background about Johnson’s resignation. Johnson would be given a severance payment of $7.4 million, which is three times his annual base salary and annual cash bonus as of July 3, Duke said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He would also receive $1.4 million in cash as his target annual cash bonus for 2012, the company said in the filing. In exchange, Johnson is expected to release all of his claims against the company. Total severance payments associated with the Progress buyout, including a voluntary separation program, a potential involuntary severance plan and payments payable to Johnson, are estimated to be between $225 million and $275 million, Duke said in the filing. Johnson sent a brief email to employees on Tuesday that did not give further details on his resignation. In the message, he said he believes the potential of the deal “remains compelling.” “It certainly caught me by surprise,” said a person who sat on Progress’ board until its recent acquisition. “Bill has been a fantastic CEO of Progress Energy. I think it’s a real loss he won’t become CEO of Duke Energy,” said the former Progress director, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The deal, which was announced in January 2011, creates the largest U.S. power company, with 57,000 megawatts of generating capacity and 7.1 million electricity customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. It also becomes the second largest U.S. operator of nuclear power plants. The original plan had been for Rogers to serve as executive chairman of the combined company, while Johnson would have been president and CEO. When the deal was announced, Rogers joked that the two executives would settle arguments by arm wrestling. “It’s not easy for CEOs of big companies to get along together - they are not known for having small egos,” said Paul Patterson, an analyst at Glenrock Associates. “Any time you see a situation in which you expect two CEOs to have an active role at the same company, you’ve got to scratch your head and wonder whether it is going to work out.” The company’s shares closed down 1.6 percent at $68.69 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. HIGH-PROFILE CEO Rogers has an unusually high profile for a utility executive. Duke’s website touts him as a “CEO statesman,” and he makes frequent media appearances in places as diverse as “60 Minutes” and “The Colbert Report.” He has testified more than 20 times before U.S. congressional committees and is known as one of the first major U.S. utility executives to have backed federal climate change legislation. He has been involved in three major transactions in his more than 23 years as a CEO and has ended up in charge of the company after each deal. Rogers said he will remain CEO for “as long as the board wants me to stay.” The deal closed on Monday after receiving clearance in the Carolinas and by federal regulators. Rogers said he was contacting the company’s key regulators to discuss the management changes. A South Carolina regulator said the last-minute leadership change would have make little difference in the outcome of the process. “We’re confident that the commitments that have been made to South Carolina will be honored by Mr. Rogers as well as they would have been under Mr. Johnson,” said Dukes Scott, executive director of the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff. Gray, Duke’s lead director, said Johnson had been “instrumental in helping us close the merger with Progress Energy, and we wish him well in his future endeavors.” At least one analyst expressed concern Duke could lose senior Progress executives, many of whom are loyal to Johnson. Rogers said on the conference call that he had contacted Progress executives on Monday night “and talked through where we’re going in the future and how we have to pull together.” “My expectation is that all will lead and make this a great success,” Rogers said. One of Johnson’s unfinished tasks that will be left to Rogers will be to decide the fate of Progress’ damaged Crystal River nuclear reactor in Florida. The 860-megawatt reactor has been shut since 2009 when workers discovered a gap in its concrete containment dome. A second hole in the concrete containment building was later discovered, and Progress officials have said the unit won’t restart until 2014 at the earliest. Progress’ Florida utility has been expected to announce this month whether it will repair the damaged reactor or shut it down. The cost of the difficult repair has been estimated at between $900 million and $1.3 billion.

52,DUK,Ex-Progress director slams Duke Energy CEO shuffle,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp acted in “bad faith” when it replaced former Progress Energy Chief Executive Bill Johnson with Duke’s Jim Rogers, just a day after a deal to combine the two companies closed, Progress’ former lead director said in an open letter. Duke (DUK.N) completed its $18 billion buyout of Progress on Monday, and on Tuesday the Duke board announced that Johnson, who had been slated to run the combined company, was leaving by “mutual agreement.” The decision came as a surprise to many Duke shareholders, Wall Street analysts, and utility commissions that had approved the deal. Replacing Johnson “can only be described as an incredible act of bad faith with regard to the undertakings of the merger agreement,” John Mullin, former lead director at Progress, said in the public letter dated July 5. “I think it was a clearly premeditated contravention of one of the most central tenets of our agreement.” The decision by the 18-person Duke board, with 11 legacy Duke directors and seven Progress directors, to install Rogers as chief executive officer was “the most blatant example of corporate deceit that I have witnessed,” Mullin wrote. Duke declined to comment on Friday. Earlier in the week, the company and its lead director, Ann Maynard Gray, declined to give any further details about Johnson’s resignation. Under a non-disparage clause in the separation agreement, Johnson and Duke are not allowed to make statements that cast the other “in a critical or unfavorable light.” Johnson will receive up to $44 million in payouts related to his resignation from the company, according to regulatory filings. The deal, announced in January 2011, created the largest U.S. power company, with 57,000 megawatts of generating capacity and 7.1 million electricity customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. It also became the second largest U.S. operator of nuclear power plants. The original plan had been for Rogers to serve as executive chairman of the combined company, with Johnson as president and CEO. Johnson was on the board when the decision was made, along with Rogers. It is unclear if either man voted on the CEO change, though Johnson has now left the Duke board, reducing its size to 17. Duke shares have dropped 4.4 percent since the announcement on Tuesday morning. By comparison, Standard & Poor’s’ utilities index .GSPU is down about 1.4 percent over the same period. In Friday afternoon trading, Duke shares were down 2.8 percent to $66.64 amid a broad market slide. Despite the controversy, corporate governance expert and University of Delaware professor Charles Elson said he was untroubled by the move. “Until the two companies come together, you never know who will be the best,” Elson said. “The board’s job is to pick who is the most effective leader, period. Sometimes before a merger, one person appears better and after a merger someone else appears better.” The North Carolina Utilities Commission, which approved the merger late last week, may decide to review its approval process. “We are still considering what next step to take and no decision has been made,” said Sam Watson, the commission’s general counsel. Robert Gruber, executive director of the NCUC Public Staff, an independent agency that makes recommendations to the utility commission on consumer matters, said Johnson’s sudden departure raises questions about how the combined utility will operate going forward. “They presented it as a friendly merger that made the best of the synergies, the cost-savings and putting the best people possible in place to manage the company,” Gruber said. “Suddenly, it became an unfriendly merger in one day.” The controversy did not appear to concern Gruber’s counterparts in South Carolina. “We have great respect for Bill Johnson, but we also have great respect for Jim Rogers,” said Dukes Scott, executive director of the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff, which participated in the merger deliberations. Johnson’s departure from Duke did cost him a leadership position at the Nuclear Energy Institute, the nuclear industry’s Washington-based trade group. Johnson, elected in May to a second one-year term as chairman of the organization, was no longer eligible to lead NEI once he resigned, an NEI spokesman said in an email. Johnson’s resignation is not without precedent among large companies that have combined.

Robert Gruber, executive director of the NCUC Public Staff, an independent agency that makes recommendations to the utility commission on consumer matters, said Johnson’s sudden departure raises questions about how the combined utility will operate going forward. “They presented it as a friendly merger that made the best of the synergies, the cost-savings and putting the best people possible in place to manage the company,” Gruber said. “Suddenly, it became and unfriendly merger in one day.” The controversy did not appear to concern Gruber’s counterparts in South Carolina. “We have great respect for Bill Johnson, but we also have great respect for Jim Rogers,” said Dukes Scott, executive director of the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff, which participated in the merger deliberations. Johnson’s departure from Duke did cost him a leadership position at the Nuclear Energy Institute, the nuclear industry’s Washington-based trade group. Johnson, elected in May to a second one-year term as chairman of the organization, was no longer eligible to lead NEI once he resigned, an NEI spokesman said in an email.

55,DUK,Ex-Progress director slams Duke Energy CEO shuffle,"* Ex-Progress CEO says Duke board acted in “bad faith” * Says “blatant example of corporate deceit” * Governance expert defends Duke board * Duke shares down 4.4 percent since announcement NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp acted in “bad faith” when it replaced former Progress Energy CEO Bill Johnson with Duke’s Jim Rogers, the former lead director of Progress said in an open letter. Duke closed on its $18 billion buyout of Progress on Monday, and on Tuesday the Duke board announced that Johnson, who had been slated to run the combined company, was leaving by “mutual agreement.” The decision came as a surprise to many Duke shareholders, Wall Street analysts, and utility commissions that had approved the deal. Replacing Johnson “can only be described as an incredible act of bad faith with regard to the undertakings of the merger agreement,” John Mullin, former lead director at Progress, said in a public letter. “I think it was a clearly premeditated contravention of one of the most central tenets of our agreement.” The decision by the 18-person Duke board, with 11 legacy Duke directors and seven Progress directors, to install Rogers as chief executive officer was “the most blatant example of corporate deceit that I have witnessed,” Mullin wrote. Johnson was on the board when the decision was made, along with Rogers. It is not clear if either man voted on the CEO change, though Johnson has now left the Duke board, making its current size 17. Duke shares have dropped 4.4 percent since the announcement on Tuesday morning. As a comparison, Standard & Poors’ utilities index is down around 1.4 percent over the same period. Despite the controversy, corporate governance expert and University of Delaware professor Charles Elson said he was untroubled by the move. “Until the two companies come together, you never know who will be the best,” Elson said. “The board’s job is to pick who is the most effective leader, period. Sometimes before a merger, one person appears better and after a merger someone else appears better.” Robert Gruber, the chief public advocate at the North Carolina Utilities Commission, told the New York Times on Friday he might not have voted to approve the buyout had he known about the management change. The deal, which was announced in January 2011, creates the largest U.S. power company, with 57,000 megawatts of generating capacity and 7.1 million electricity customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. It also becomes the second largest U.S. operator of nuclear power plants. The original plan had been for Rogers to serve as executive chairman of the combined company, while Johnson would have been president and CEO.

56,DUK,North Carolina agencies investigating Duke Energy CEO shuffle,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - North Carolina officials late Friday launched two investigations into the surprising move by Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N) directors to replace former Progress Energy Chief Executive Bill Johnson with Duke CEO Jim Rogers, just a day after a deal to create the largest U.S. utility company was finalized. The North Carolina Utilities Commission, which approved Duke’s $18 billion buyout of Progress late last week, ordered Rogers to appear at a hearing Tuesday to answer questions on the timing of the decision to replace Johnson, the commission said in a two-page order. Separately, Roy Cooper, attorney general in North Carolina where both companies are based, opened an investigation and ordered Duke officials to produce merger-related documents from board members and senior managers of both companies from as far back as January 2011. “This significant management change within hours after the merger has put the company on credit watch, so we need to get to the bottom of this to make sure we protect consumers,” Cooper said in a statement. The attorney general requested “all documents or communications that discuss the prospective chief executive officer of the merged entity” and “any discussion of any effort or plan for James E. Rogers to be the chief executive officer of such merged entity.” The agency also seeks documents that “identify or assess risks and/or impacts,” such as financial, investor or regulatory associated with a change of management after the merger. A Duke spokesman said Rogers would be at the commission hearing Tuesday and the company was evaluating the request for documents from the attorney general. The investigations followed public comment earlier Friday by Progress’s former lead director that Duke directors acted in “bad faith” when it replaced Johnson. Duke completed the buyout of Progress on Monday, and on Tuesday the Duke board announced that Johnson, who had been slated to run the combined company, was leaving by “mutual agreement.” The decision came as a surprise to many Duke shareholders, Wall Street analysts, and utility commissions that had approved the deal. Standard & Poor’s said it was reevaluating credit ratings for Duke and its utilities, citing the management news. “The sudden shift in management raises concerns about effective corporate governance, successful handling of the anticipated merger integration and the ongoing effective management of pending challenges that face the combined entity,” S&P; said. Replacing Johnson “can only be described as an incredible act of bad faith with regard to the undertakings of the merger agreement,” John Mullin, former lead director at Progress, said in the public letter dated July 5. “I think it was a clearly premeditated contravention of one of the most central tenets of our agreement.” The decision by the 18-person Duke board, with 11 legacy Duke directors and seven Progress directors, to install Rogers as chief executive officer was “the most blatant example of corporate deceit that I have witnessed,” Mullin wrote. Duke declined to comment on Friday. Earlier in the week, the company and its lead director, Ann Maynard Gray, declined to give any further details about Johnson’s resignation. Under a non-disparage clause in the separation agreement, Johnson and Duke are not allowed to make statements that cast the other “in a critical or unfavorable light.” Johnson will receive up to $44 million in payouts related to his resignation from the company, according to regulatory filings. The deal, announced in January 2011, created the largest U.S. power company, with 57,000 megawatts of generating capacity and 7.1 million electricity customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio.

58,DUK,"Duke Energy board unhappy with ""autocratic"" Johnson","RALEIGH, North Carolina (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp directors grew increasingly worried about Progress Energy Chief Executive Bill Johnson’s “autocratic” management style and lacked confidence he could lead the largest U.S. utility, Duke CEO Jim Rogers told North Carolina regulators on Tuesday. The unusual hearing was called by the North Carolina Utilities Commission to look into Johnson’s surprise ouster only hours after Duke completed its $18 billion takeover of Progress last week. U.S. regulators had approved the merger on the understanding that Rogers would be executive chairman and Johnson would be CEO of the combined company. Rogers told commissioners on Tuesday that Ann Maynard Gray, Duke’s lead director, privately approached him on June 23 to express concerns about Johnson’s abilities to lead the combined company. According to Rogers, Gray asked if he would be willing to take the CEO job if the board decided to remove Johnson. “They felt his style was autocratic and discouraged different points of view,” Rogers said, citing concerns by the board that Johnson would try to impose Progress culture on Duke. “There was a loss of confidence in Bill and each director had different reasons, apparently, and this kind of accumulated over a period of time.” Rogers said Duke directors were worried about problems at several Progress nuclear plants and that the financial performance of Progress after the merger announcement was also not what the board expected. He gave no details. It was not immediately clear if the commission was satisfied with Rogers’ explanations, or if the regulator intended to reopen its regulatory review of the acquisition. “It answered a lot of questions,” Utilities Commission Chairman Edward Finley Jr. said of Rogers’ testimony. “I’m sure it raised other questions. We got part of the story at least.” Finley declined to speculate on how long the inquiry would continue or the next step. “Stay tuned,” he said. The deal was first announced in January 2011, when Progress agreed to be bought by Duke at a relatively thin 7 percent premium. Progress’ former lead director, John Mullin, said last week that the company would not have agreed to the deal if Duke had not promised that Johnson would become CEO. North Carolina attorney general Roy Cooper has opened his own investigation and ordered Duke officials to produce merger-related documents from board members and senior managers of both companies going as far back as January 2011. The coup in the Duke boardroom brought into public focus the often rocky relations companies have operating in a regulated world where state commissions hold broad authority to set the rates a utility can charge customers, determine its profit margin and tell the company how it must operate. With the Progress takeover, Duke became the largest U.S. power company, with 57,000 megawatts of generating capacity and 7.1 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. Wade Smith, a Raleigh attorney representing Bill Johnson said his client had been looking forward to running Duke. “The fact that he is held in the highest regard by his peers in the utility industry and in the North Carolina business community speaks volumes about his leadership and business capabilities,” Smith said in a statement. Regardless, being CEO for a day paid off for Johnson. Utilities Commissioner Susan Warren Rabon questioned Rogers about the size of Johnson’s $44 million severance package. She asked if it would be fair to think that Duke’s rates were too high if it could afford such a large compensation package for a “20-minute CEO.” “The actual part tied to the transition is probably around $7 million,” Rogers replied. “The lion’s share of the $44 million were items that Mr. Johnson had earned and were vested at the point of the transition.” He added, “I will assure you none of these dollars will be charged to the customers of this state. We’re not taking customer money. We’re taking investor money to pay this.” Duke is now the second largest U.S. operator of nuclear power plants. Rogers said the board was concerned about problems at Progress’ existing nuclear facilities and at its Crystal River reactor in Florida, which has been shut since 2009 due to unprecedented cracking in the walls of the containment building. Another major hurdle at Crystal River is whether repairs to the cracked walls will be paid for by an industry insurance fund. Rogers said Duke will now “pour money” into Progress’ operating reactors to “bring them back to excellence.” Glenrock Associates analyst Paul Patterson said cultural issues seem to have played the largest role in Johnson’s departure. “One has to wonder whether the issues associated with Crystal River and the company’s nuclear plants would have had the same impact if it weren’t for the so-called leadership style issue,” he said. Johnson is known for being a more hands-on leader, while Rogers has a reputation for being focused on macro issues, preferring to leave minutia to subordinates. Rogers has an unusually high profile for a utility executive, making frequent media appearances in places as diverse as “60 Minutes” and “The Colbert Report.” He has testified more than 20 times before U.S. congressional committees and is known as one of the first major U.S. utility executives to have backed federal climate change legislation. On Tuesday, he appeared nervous and referred frequently to a typed statement covered with green highlighting and hand-written notes. He answered many questions from the commission’s chairman with short replies of, “Yes sir” or “No sir.” Rogers has been involved in three major transactions in his more than 23 years as a CEO and has ended up in charge of the company after each deal. But in the Progress case, Rogers told the commission he had been ready to leave the CEO job to Johnson and become executive chairman. He said he had plans to join the boards of the Nature Conservancy and the Aspen Institute, and that the Duke board had thrown a retirement party and gave him a parting gift last December. “We from the very beginning intended that Mr. Johnson would be CEO of the company once the deal was closed,” Rogers said. But in a meeting on the evening of July 2, just after the deal closed at 4:02 p.m. EST, the new Duke board voted to replace Johnson with Rogers. Ten former Duke directors outvoted five legacy Progress directors. One Progress director was absent, and Johnson and Rogers did not vote. Standard & Poor’s has said it is reevaluating credit ratings for Duke and its utilities, citing the management news. Rogers said he did not think S&P;’s negative outlook for Duke would affect the cost of money the utility borrows. “They are concerned from corporate governance standpoint about this change,” Rogers said. “It took them by surprise as it took this commission by surprise.” ",7102012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-duke-progress/duke-energy-board-unhappy-with-autocratic-johnson-idUSBRE8691IZ20120710

60,DUK,Duke CEO: Board lost confidence in Progress CEO,"RALEIGH, North Carolina (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp’s (DUK.N) board of directors lost confidence in Progress Energy CEO Bill Johnson in part because of his company’s financial performance and the management of its nuclear power business, Duke Chief Executive Jim Rogers told North Carolina regulators on Tuesday. Rogers was testifying at a hearing called by the North Carolina Utilities Commission to look into Johnson’s ouster following Duke’s $18 billion takeover of Progress, which was completed last week. He said the board’s concerns also extended to Johnson’s management methods and the directors worried he would try to impose Progress’ culture on Duke. “They felt his style was autocratic and discouraged different points of view,” Rogers said. Rogers said the company’s lead director approached him in late June with her concerns about Johnson’s abilities to lead a combined company. She asked him then whether he would be willing to remain as CEO if the board decided to remove Johnson. The combined directors voted straight down company lines to replace Johnson with Rogers, with 10 former Duke directors outvoting five legacy Progress directors. Johnson and Rogers, both directors at the time, did not vote and one Progress director was absent. Johnson could not be immediately reached for comment. Rogers’ appearance at the hearing drew an overflow audience. The utilities commission hearing room, which seats 106, was packed, requiring the commission to open an adjacent room for others to hear. Duke directors replaced Johnson with Rogers as head of the merged company just hours after the deal closed, despite telling regulators while the deal was under review that Rogers would be executive chairman and Johnson would be CEO. With the Progress takeover, Duke became the largest U.S. power company, with 57,000 megawatts of generating capacity and 7.1 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. Duke also is now the second largest U.S. operator of nuclear power plants. Utilities Commissioner Susan Warren Rabon questioned Rogers about the size of Johnson’s more than $40 million severance package. “The actual part tied to the transition is probably around $7 million,” Rogers said. “The lion’s share of the $44 million were items that Mr. Johnson had earned and were vested at the point of the transition.” Rabon asked if it would be fair to think the Duke’s rates were too high if it could afford such a large compensation package for a 20 minute CEO. “I will assure you none of these dollars will be charged to the customers of this state,” Rogers said. “We’re not taking customer money. We’re taking investor money to pay this.” Utility regulators in South Carolina and Florida planned to attend or monitor Rogers’ appearance before the North Carolina commission. North Carolina’s attorney general, Roy Cooper, has opened his own investigation and ordered Duke officials to produce merger-related documents from board members and senior managers of both companies going as far back as January 2011, when the deal was first announced. Standard & Poor’s also said it is reevaluating credit ratings for Duke and its utilities, citing the management news.

62,DUK,Duke Energy faces regulator chill after CEO switch,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp, under regulatory scrutiny over the abrupt ouster of its CEO, is not expected to be forced to undo its purchase of Progress Energy, but could face a cold reception when it seeks new power rates in North Carolina later this year. Duke’s board of directors removed former Progress chief Bill Johnson from the top spot just hours after completing the $18 billion acquisition last week and asked former Duke CEO James Rogers to take over. The news angered utility regulators in North Carolina who approved the merger on assumptions that included Johnson’s installation as CEO. The North Carolina Utility Commission (NCUC) questioned Rogers in a public hearing on Tuesday about the decision. Rogers had been slated become executive chairman of the combined company. Rogers testified that he was not involved in the decision, but said Duke board members had come to him in the weeks before the merger closed to express worries about Johnson’s ability to lead what is now the largest U.S. power utility. The NCUC has not said what measures it was considering following the Tuesday hearing, including whether or not it might summon Johnson. “There hasn’t been a decision,” said Len Green, senior staff attorney at the NCUC. “I believe they are reviewing what they heard yesterday.” Experts said a move to re-open the process that approved the merger was not likely and would be unprecedented. Robert Gruber, executive Director of the public staff of the NCUC, which advises the commission, said the commission could take other measures to penalize Duke. The company is expected to file two requests to adjust power rates in North Carolina this year and Duke could face a chilly reception in the wake of the CEO controversy. “I think we’re in uncharted territory. Short of undoing the merger approval, they could possibly ... impose further conditions. They could possibly consider a penalty,” Gruber said. The NCUC approves a maximum return on equity that Duke earns from its operations in the state. That rate was set at 10.5 percent previously, below the 11.5 percent return the company sought, but higher than the 9 percent one consumer advocate requested. That difference of a percentage point or two can easily top $100 million for Duke’s earnings, Gruber said. “The trust has been undermined somewhat. And I think public confidence has been undermined,” he said. The risk of a lower return in future rate cases was more likely than a potential re-opening of the merger approvals, according to Philip Adams, senior analyst at bond research service Gimme Credit. “Every subsequent matter that comes between (Duke and the regulator) become more difficult,” he said. Members of the Progress board who left the company at the completion of the merger were angered by Johnson’s ouster, but had few options and were not planning a lawsuit. “We don’t really have any standing. We aren’t banding together to do anything,” former Progress board member Alfred C. Tollison, Jr. told Reuters. “We’re just disappointed. I don’t see a whole lot that we can do except just have regret.” Duke’s board voted 10-5 to remove Johnson and replace him with Rogers. The vote was split along company lines. Rogers sought to mend fences with Progress’ employees at a meeting in a downtown Raleigh hotel on Tuesday morning, where more than 1,000 people jammed two rooms to hear from their new boss. “It was a very forthright discussion,” Duke spokesman Tom Williams said without elaborating. The CEO switch also angered one long-time activist Duke shareholder, who told Reuters he submitted a proposal for the company to have an independent board chairman. Rogers currently retains the chairman title in addition to CEO. “There needs to be more independence and the board has to become an advocate for shareholders’ interests and demand accountability” of company executives, said Gerald Armstrong, part of a loose network of shareholder activists who files dozens of shareholder proposals each year. Armstrong said he supported the merger of Progress into Duke because he thought Johnson’s presence would lead to greater accountability and help “restore respect and integrity” at Duke following an executive shake-up there last year related to an over-budget coal-fired plant under construction in Indiana.

64,DUK,"Duke Energy board unhappy with ""autocratic"" Johnson","RALEIGH, North Carolina (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp directors grew increasingly worried about Progress Energy Chief Executive Bill Johnson’s “autocratic” management style and lacked confidence he could lead the largest U.S. utility, Duke CEO Jim Rogers told North Carolina regulators on Tuesday. The unusual hearing was called by the North Carolina Utilities Commission to look into Johnson’s surprise ouster only hours after Duke completed its $18 billion takeover of Progress last week. U.S. regulators had approved the merger on the understanding that Rogers would be executive chairman and Johnson would be CEO of the combined company. Rogers told commissioners on Tuesday that Ann Maynard Gray, Duke’s lead director, privately approached him on June 23 to express concerns about Johnson’s abilities to lead the combined company. According to Rogers, Gray asked if he would be willing to take the CEO job if the board decided to remove Johnson. “They felt his style was autocratic and discouraged different points of view,” Rogers said, citing concerns by the board that Johnson would try to impose Progress culture on Duke. “There was a loss of confidence in Bill and each director had different reasons, apparently, and this kind of accumulated over a period of time.” Rogers said Duke directors were worried about problems at several Progress nuclear plants and that the financial performance of Progress after the merger announcement was also not what the board expected. He gave no details. It was not immediately clear if the commission was satisfied with Rogers’ explanations, or if the regulator intended to reopen its regulatory review of the acquisition. “It answered a lot of questions,” Utilities Commission Chairman Edward Finley Jr. said of Rogers’ testimony. “I’m sure it raised other questions. We got part of the story at least.” Finley declined to speculate on how long the inquiry would continue or the next step. “Stay tuned,” he said. The deal was first announced in January 2011, when Progress agreed to be bought by Duke at a relatively thin 7 percent premium. Progress’ former lead director, John Mullin, said last week that the company would not have agreed to the deal if Duke had not promised that Johnson would become CEO. North Carolina attorney general Roy Cooper has opened his own investigation and ordered Duke officials to produce merger-related documents from board members and senior managers of both companies going as far back as January 2011. Late Tuesday, Duke announced the immediate resignations of three executives who once held senior positions at Progress. These executives included Chief Administrative Officer Mark Mulhern, who had been Progress’ chief financial officer; John McArthur, executive vice president of regulated utilities; and Paula Sims, chief integration and innovation officer. The coup in the Duke boardroom brought into public focus the often rocky relations companies have operating in a regulated world where state commissions hold broad authority to set the rates a utility can charge customers, determine its profit margin and tell the company how it must operate. With the Progress takeover, Duke became the largest U.S. power company, with 57,000 megawatts of generating capacity and 7.1 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. Wade Smith, a Raleigh attorney representing Bill Johnson said his client had been looking forward to running Duke. “The fact that he is held in the highest regard by his peers in the utility industry and in the North Carolina business community speaks volumes about his leadership and business capabilities,” Smith said in a statement. Regardless, being CEO for a day paid off for Johnson. Utilities Commissioner Susan Warren Rabon questioned Rogers about the size of Johnson’s $44 million severance package. She asked if it would be fair to think that Duke’s rates were too high if it could afford such a large compensation package for a “20-minute CEO.” “The actual part tied to the transition is probably around $7 million,” Rogers replied. “The lion’s share of the $44 million were items that Mr. Johnson had earned and were vested at the point of the transition.” He added, “I will assure you none of these dollars will be charged to the customers of this state. We’re not taking customer money. We’re taking investor money to pay this.” Duke is now the second largest U.S. operator of nuclear power plants. Rogers said the board was concerned about problems at Progress’ existing nuclear facilities and at its Crystal River reactor in Florida, which has been shut since 2009 due to unprecedented cracking in the walls of the containment building. Another major hurdle at Crystal River is whether repairs to the cracked walls will be paid for by an industry insurance fund. Rogers said Duke will now “pour money” into Progress’ operating reactors to “bring them back to excellence.” Glenrock Associates analyst Paul Patterson said cultural issues seem to have played the largest role in Johnson’s departure. “One has to wonder whether the issues associated with Crystal River and the company’s nuclear plants would have had the same impact if it weren’t for the so-called leadership style issue,” he said. Johnson is known for being a more hands-on leader, while Rogers has a reputation for being focused on macro issues, preferring to leave minutiae to subordinates. Rogers has an unusually high profile for a utility executive, making frequent media appearances in places as diverse as “60 Minutes” and “The Colbert Report.” He has testified more than 20 times before U.S. congressional committees and is known as one of the first major U.S. utility executives to have backed federal climate change legislation. On Tuesday, he appeared nervous and referred frequently to a typed statement covered with green highlighting and hand-written notes. He answered many questions from the commission’s chairman with short replies of, “Yes sir” or “No sir.” Rogers has been involved in three major transactions in his more than 23 years as a CEO and has ended up in charge of the company after each deal. But in the Progress case, Rogers told the commission he had been ready to leave the CEO job to Johnson and become executive chairman. He said he had plans to join the boards of the Nature Conservancy and the Aspen Institute, and that the Duke board had thrown a retirement party and gave him a parting gift last December. “We from the very beginning intended that Mr. Johnson would be CEO of the company once the deal was closed,” Rogers said. But in a meeting on the evening of July 2, just after the deal closed at 4:02 p.m. EST, the new Duke board voted to replace Johnson with Rogers. Ten former Duke directors outvoted five legacy Progress directors. One Progress director was absent, and Johnson and Rogers did not vote. Standard & Poor’s has said it is reevaluating credit ratings for Duke and its utilities, citing the management news. Rogers said he did not think S&P;’s negative outlook for Duke would affect the cost of money the utility borrows. “They are concerned from corporate governance standpoint about this change,” Rogers said. “It took them by surprise as it took this commission by surprise.” ",7112012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-duke-progress/duke-energy-board-unhappy-with-autocratic-johnson-idUSBRE8691IZ20120711

The North Carolina Utilities Commission has also called Duke’s lead director, Ann Maynard Gray, and other Duke directors to appear before the commission, according to an order issued on Thursday. Duke, which completed its $18 billion takeover of Progress on July 2, voted to replace Johnson with its own CEO, Jim Rogers, just hours after closing the deal. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Johnson was supposed to hold the position of CEO, while Rogers would serve as executive chairman. The news angered utility regulators in North Carolina, who approved the merger on assumptions that included Johnson’s installation as CEO. Rogers appeared before the commission on Tuesday, and said he believed that Johnson’s “autocratic” management style  led Duke’s board to lose confidence that he could lead the largest U.S. utility. He also questioned Johnson’s management of Progress’s nuclear power business as well as the utilities’ financial performance after the deal was announced. Johnson, as well as Duke directors Marie McKee and James Hyler, are scheduled to appear at a hearing on Thursday, July 19, according to the order. Hyler and McKee were both directors at Progress before the merger. Gray and Michael Browning, both Duke directors before the deal, will testify on Friday, July 20. The commission has also ordered Duke to produce copies of documents including minutes from Duke’s board and board committee meetings, memos about the decision and all emails between Duke’s board members since December. Johnson’s separation agreement includes a non-disparagement clause, but there is an exception for “providing truthful disclosures as required by applicable law or legal process.” With the Progress takeover, Duke became the largest U.S. power company, with 57,000 megawatts of generating capacity and 7.1 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. Duke spokesman Tom Williams declined to comment on the commission’s continued investigation of the executive shuffle. “Our focus at Duke Energy is on bringing our two companies together to harvest our merger’s savings for our customers and to deliver value to our shareholders,” Williams said in a statement.",7122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/duke-progress/update-1-nc-panel-calls-progresss-johnson-to-testify-on-duke-ceo-shakeup-idUSL2E8ICJ7N20120712

71,DUK,Duke-Progress merger puts restart of Florida reactor in doubt,"* Damaged Crystal River reactor in Florida shut since 2009 * Duke board ordered independent look at repair costs * Insurance coverage not resolved, in mediation By Eileen O’Grady July 11 (Reuters) - The likelihood that the damaged Crystal River nuclear reactor in Florida will produce another megawatt of electricity appears to have dimmed following the merger of owner, Progress Energy, with Duke Energy, and the surprise exit of Progress’ top executive Bill Johnson, according to testimony by Duke’s chief executive Jim Rogers this week. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke Energy became the largest electric utility and second-largest nuclear operator in the nation this week when it acquired Raleigh, N.C.-based Progress Energy in a deal valued at $18 billion. Crystal River’s prolonged shutdown and issues at other Progress-owned nuclear units played a role in Johnson’s exit, the man who had been slated to lead the merged company, according to the testimony. On Tuesday, Duke’s Rogers told a special hearing called by the North Carolina Utilities Commission to look into Johnson’s unexpected departure that Duke’s board members had lost confidence in Johnson’s management style. Duke board members voted to oust Johnson from the job of chief executive of the merged company just hours after the deal was completed. Johnson’s departure may now put the restart of Crystal River in doubt as he had been a strong proponent of repairing it. Crystal River “is one area we had great concern about,” Rogers said, citing insight gained from Duke director James Rhodes, the retired chief executive of the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO), a nuclear industry group that promotes safety and reliability. Progress’ Florida unit, the state’s second largest utility, has been struggling since 2009 to return the 838-megawatt Crystal River reactor to service after cracks began to be found in the containment building’s 42-inch (107 cm) thick walls. A series of mistakes when the building wall was opened and during initial repair work forced the utility to evaluate whether it would make more sense to pursue a complicated repair job or to shut the reactor permanently. Rogers told North Carolina regulators that the board became concerned that Progress’ assessment of the risk and its estimate of the cost to repair the damaged reactor building were not realistic and ordered an independent analysis. “We had expressed clearly to them that we really needed, as a new board, to consider whether to retire or replace,” Rogers said. In quarterly earnings calls, Johnson expressed his desire to try to return Crystal River to service sometime in 2014 at an estimated cost of $1.3 billion, saying Progress planned to make a presentation to the new Duke board after the merger. On July 2, the same day Duke completed the merger, Progress told its state regulators it had moved forward to select a company to repair Crystal River “should the choice to repair (the reactor building) be made,” in a status filing. Rogers also revealed that ongoing talks with Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), an industry-sponsored insurance fund, on Crystal River claims had not been resolved, but had shifted into a mediation phase. According to Progress filings, NEIL stopped making payments in May 2011. An official with Florida’s Office of Public Counsel, an agency that represents consumers interests in state utility proceedings, said he was “gravely concerned” about Rogers’ comments regarding Crystal River’s future. The agency believed that Johnson, as CEO of the merged company, “would diligently pursue all reasonable avenues of repairing and successfully returning (Crystal River) to service for the benefit of Florida customers,” said Charles Rehwinkel, deputy public counsel, in a statement. “We further expected that Duke, under Johnson’s leadership, would aggressively pursue collection of the full amount of coverage for repair and replacement power costs under the NEIL insurance policy that Florida customers have paid the premiums for over the past 30 or so years,” he added. As of March 31, Progress had spent $506 million to replace lost generation from Crystal River and $279 million on repairs. It has recovered $162 million in replacement power costs and $143 million in repair costs from NEIL, according to filings. Rogers also said Duke board members expressed concern about a “lack of sufficient improvement” at Progress’ Brunswick reactors which have been under increased safety monitoring by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. An NRC spokesman said problems that have led to increased  scrutiny at the plants operated by Progress were unrelated. “We’ve seen no indication that the overall management of the Progress nuclear fleet is deficient,” said Roger Hannah of the NRC regional office in Atlanta. Rogers told the North Carolina commission Duke will “pour money” into Progress’ operating reactors to “bring them back to excellence.” He made no such commitment for Crystal River.",7122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-nuclear-crystalriver/duke-progress-merger-puts-restart-of-florida-reactor-in-doubt-idUSL2E8IB9JF20120712

74,DUK,Duke shareholder sues board over CEO shakeup,"July 17 (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp directors who voted to abruptly oust the company’s former chief executive this month should pay for the damage they caused the largest U.S. power company, according to a shareholder lawsuit filed on Tuesday. Hours after Duke closed its $18 billion merger with Progress Energy on July 2, which regulators approved on the understanding that Progress CEO Bill Johnson would lead the company, the board voted to replace Johnson with Duke CEO James Rogers. The move led rating agencies to consider cutting Duke’s debt rating, citing the boardroom uncertainty. The CEO change also prompted an investigation by regulators. The probe could make it tougher for the company to get regulatory approval for higher rates. “The director defendants’ conspiracy and tactics have had a devastating effect on Duke’s credibility,” said the complaint, which was brought by individual investor Lesley Rupp of Alabama. It said damages could be “enormous.” The complaint said the potential harm included the resignations of former Progress executives who were expected to help merge operations and Johnson’s severance package of $44 million. Duke spokesman Dave Scanzoni said the company believed the lawsuit was entirely without merit and that Duke intended to defend itself vigorously. The lawsuit was filed in Court of Chancery in Delaware, where Duke is incorporated, and also names Rogers as a defendant. It does not name as defendants the former Progress directors who are now on the Duke board. They voted against replacing Johnson. The case is a derivative lawsuit, which means the shareholder essentially is seeking to step into the shoes of the company and seeks to recover from the directors the damage they caused Duke. Shareholders will benefit only indirectly. Rogers told the North Carolina Utilities Commission last week that Duke’s board had lost confidence in Johnson due to Johnson’s “autocratic” management style. Rogers also questioned Johnson’s management of Progress’s nuclear power business as well as the utilities’ financial performance after the deal was announced.

75,DUK,Ex-Progress CEO says Duke wanted out of merger,"RALEIGH, North Carolina (Reuters) - Duke Energy Co felt “buyer’s remorse” and sought to back out of the $18 billion deal to buy Progress Energy after federal regulators called for costly measures to curb the merged company’s market power, former Progress CEO William Johnson said on Thursday. In testimony before the North Carolina Utilities Commission, Johnson also said that repair problems at the company’s damaged Crystal River nuclear unit were well known by Duke when it agreed to buy Progress in January 2011. Johnson’s statements were his first since he was ousted as Duke CEO in the board of directors’ first act after the deal was closed on July 2, and stood in sharp contrast to testimony given last week by Duke CEO James Rogers. Johnson said the deal received close scrutiny at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which in December 2011 called for measures to reduce the combined company’s market power that would cost Duke and Progress between $200 million and $225 million. That triggered worries at Duke, Johnson said, and weeks later, Rogers and CFO Lynn Good told Wall Street analysts at a meeting that the company might not be able to close the deal, and that Duke would be better off on its own because of the regulatory barriers. Soon Wall Street began speculating that Duke might try to use a “burdensome regulatory affect” clause in the merger agreement to halt the deal, he said. “This is like dropping an atomic bomb on your deal,” Johnson said. A spokesman for Duke said the company never sought to back out of the merger with Progress, and denied that Duke executives had said the company would be better off without the deal. But Johnson said that Progress, which had nearly agreed to be purchased by Southern Co before the Duke deal, had hired lawyers to make sure the Duke merger closed, even as tempers flared between the Duke and Progress executives. “They wanted the merger, then they didn’t want it, then they couldn’t get out of it, and then they didn’t want to be stuck with me as the person who dragged them into it,” Johnson said. The former executive also said he was angered by suggestions Rogers made to the Charlotte Business Journal early this year that Progress had agreed to be bought for a modest 5 percent premium over its then-market price in order for Johnson to become CEO. “This was quite disrespectful, and my board was furious,” he said. “I was furious.” Duke’s purchase of Progress created the nation’s largest utility, but has drawn anger from the regulators in Raleigh, where Progress is based, after Duke’s board reversed its decision to have Johnson replace Rogers as CEO. The newly merged Duke board, dominated by directors from the former Duke board, voted Johnson out minutes after he took the CEO spot despite the companies’ stated plan for him to take the helm of the company from Rogers, who was to step aside and become the merged company’s executive chairman. One independent Progress board member who joined the new Duke board at completion of the merger said she had been blindsided by lead Duke director Ann Gray’s quick effort to remove Johnson. “I couldn’t believe it. I didn’t know whether to cry or throw up,” Marie McKee told the NCUC. McKee told the NCUC that she and the other four former Progress board members who were present during the meeting argued unsuccessfully for an hour to change the legacy Duke board members’ opinions or postpone a vote. Johnson, who at times grew emotional and appeared to choke back tears when he offered a goodbye to employees at his former company during his testimony, said he was stunned when Gray told him the board wanted his resignation. “She represents the board, there is no appeal,” Johnson said in response to a question from NCUC Chairman Edward Finley. “Well maybe, maybe not,” said Finley. The NCUC has not indicated whether it would try to re-open its approval of the merger, or impose new financial conditions on it, although corporate governance experts have said the board was within its rights to change the CEO if it had concerns. Finley’s remark indicated that the NCUC is looking to take some action. “The commission will have the last word on this,” said Robert Gruber, executive director of the public staff of the utilities commission. But one Duke lawyer blasted the NCUC for Finley’s refusal to allow Duke to cross-examine Johnson during the hearing. “This was a surprising and disappointing hearing,” said Burley Mitchell, a former North Carolina Supreme Court chief justice now in private practice at law firm Womble, Carlyle, Sandridge and Rice, LLP. “Some of the facts that were presented as facts are in dispute.” Rogers and Gray, who is scheduled to testify on Friday, have pointed to Johnson’s handling of troublesome repairs at the Crystal River nuclear plant in Florida as a key reason for the board’s decision to remove Johnson. “We understood that the Crystal River nuclear plant had been shut down for repairs since 2009. However, we were told that Progress expected Crystal River to resume operations in April 2011, and that Progress expected significant insurance recoveries in connection with the repairs,” Gray said in a filing to the commission earlier this week. The 838-megawatt Crystal River reactor remains shut, and Progress had not secured insurance payments by the close of the Duke-Progress deal. Duke has said it has not yet decided whether to pay for expensive repairs at Crystal River, or to seek a shutdown and perhaps build a new nuclear plant. Johnson said Progress had openly discussed with both Duke and the public all the problems at the plant, and that Duke had sent a team to monitor the plant a year before the deal closed. “This has been widely reported and widely disclosed,” Johnson told the commission. Before Thursday’s hearing, Johnson had remained quiet, abiding by a “non-disparagement” clause in his separation contract which paid him a total stock and compensation package of about $44 million. That clause, however, does not apply to comments made to the regulatory bodies. Angry NCUC commissioners questioned Rogers last week about why the power company’s board moved immediately from closing the merger to voting to ask for Johnson’s resignation. Rogers, who took the CEO job at Duke after the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company bought Cinergy, where he had been CEO, said there was no triggering event. But he said Duke’s board became discouraged with Johnson toward the end of the 18 months it took to win federal approval for the deal, Progress’ handling of Crystal River, its weak financial results and Johnson’s early moves toward integrating the two companies. “They felt his style was autocratic and discouraged different points of view,” Rogers testified. Johnson, who was warmly greeted by Progress employees as he entered the building, said he had never been accused of being autocratic, but that he was driven toward closing the deal. “I worked for him for 15 years and found him to be one of the most genuine people and a great leader, someone I really personally admire,” Sharon Hall, a manager at the Progress side of the company, told Reuters. “The day after (he was ousted) it felt like we had been punched in the gut.” ",7192012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-duke-johnson/ex-progress-ceo-says-duke-wanted-out-of-merger-idUSBRE86I0OK20120719
76,DUK,UPDATE 5-Ex-Progress CEO says Duke wanted out of merger,"* Duke had buyer’s remorse, Johnson said * Nuclear plant issues were well-known * Tensions between two companies grew in final months By Matt Daily RALEIGH, North Carolina, July 19 (Reuters) - Duke Energy Co felt “buyer’s remorse” and sought to back out of the $18 billion deal to buy Progress Energy after federal regulators called for costly measures to curb the merged company’s market power, former Progress CEO William Johnson said on Thursday. In testimony before the North Carolina Utilities Commission, Johnson also said that repair problems at the company’s damaged Crystal River nuclear unit were well known by Duke when it agreed to buy Progress in January 2011. Johnson’s statements were his first since he was ousted as Duke CEO in the board of directors’ first act after the deal was closed on July 2, and stood in sharp contrast to testimony given last week by Duke CEO James Rogers. Johnson said the deal received close scrutiny at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which in December 2011 called for measures to reduce the combined company’s market power that would cost Duke and Progress between $200 million and $225 million. That triggered worries at Duke, Johnson said, and weeks later, Rogers and CFO Lynn Good told Wall Street analysts at a meeting that the company might not be able to close the deal, and that Duke would be better off on its own because of the regulatory barriers. Soon Wall Street began speculating that Duke might try to use a “burdensome regulatory affect” clause in the merger agreement to halt the deal, he said. “This is like dropping an atomic bomb on your deal,” Johnson said. A spokesman for Duke said the company never sought to back out of the merger with Progress, and denied that Duke executives had said the company would be better off without the deal. But Johnson said that Progress, which had nearly agreed to be purchased by Southern Co before the Duke deal, had hired lawyers to make sure the Duke merger closed, even as tempers flared between the Duke and Progress executives. “They wanted the merger, then they didn’t want it, then they couldn’t get out of it, and then they didn’t want to be stuck with me as the person who dragged them into it,” Johnson said.

77,DUK,Duke Energy's 20-minute CEO Johnson set to testify,"RALEIGH, North Carolina, July 19 (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp’s 20-minute CEO is set to give his side on Thursday of the saga that saw him ousted from the top job just moments after the company finalized the $18 billion deal that made it the nation’s largest utility. William Johnson, the former head of Progress Energy who was set to run Duke at the completion of the takeover, will testify before North Carolina’s utility regulators about the surprise boardroom drama that saw Duke’s directors vote him out of the CEO spot earlier this month and return Duke CEO James Rogers to the position. The newly-merged Duke board, which was dominated by directors from the former Duke board, voted Johnson out minutes after he took the CEO spot despite the companies’ long-stated plan for him to take the helm of the company from Rogers, who was to step aside and become the merged company’s executive chairman. So far, Johnson has remained quiet, abiding by a “non-disparagement” clause in his separation contract that paid him a total stock and compensation package of about $44 million. That clause, however, does not apply to comments made to the regulatory bodies. Angry commissioners from the North Carolina Utility Commission questioned Rogers last week about why the power company’s board moved immediately from closing the merger to voting to request Johnson’s resignation. Rogers, who took the CEO job at Duke after the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company bought Cinergy, where he was CEO, said there was no triggering event. But the board became discouraged with Johnson toward the end of the 18 months it took to win federal approval for the deal around Progress’ handling of repairs at its Crystal River nuclear plant, its weak financial results and Johnson’s early moves toward integrating the two companies, Rogers said. “They felt his style was autocratic and discouraged different points of view,” Rogers testified. Former Progress board members have blasted the quick ouster, including the former lead independent director John Mullin who wrote in an open letter that the move was “the most blatant example of corporate deceit that I have witnessed.” Still, it is unlikely that the NCUC will move to add new conditions to the merger, which it had already approved. But Duke could face a chilly reception when it comes before the regulator in the coming months to seek electricity rate adjustments that will determine how much money the company can earn in the state, which is home to about 45 percent of its customers. And that pain could spread, as utility regulators in Florida have requested the Duke’s Rogers testify there as well about the issue. Since the turmoil on July 2, Duke shares have fallen 5.5 percent, and rating agency Standard & Poor’s put its “A-“ rating on Duke’s debt on watch for a downgrade because of the abrupt executive switch.",7192012,http://www.reuters.com/article/duke-johnson/duke-energys-20-minute-ceo-johnson-set-to-testify-idUSL2E8IIJKG20120719
78,DUK,"Duke director grew wary of ""controlling"" ex-Progress CEO","RALEIGH, North Carolina (Reuters) - Duke Energy’s (DUK.N) board grew frustrated with then-Progress Energy Chief Executive William Johnson’s lack of transparency about a troubled nuclear power plant in the months before their merger closed, Duke’s lead director said on Friday. Ann Maynard Gray, the Duke director, told the North Carolina Utilities Commission that lack of disclosure about the plant and Johnson’s “controlling” management style prompted Duke’s board to seek his resignation shortly after Duke completed the $18 billion deal that put him in the CEO job. “I think the reasons why Bill was asked to resign were unique to his leadership style,” Gray testified. The quick CEO switch that put James Rogers back in the top job has created turmoil over the past two weeks for Duke in North Carolina around the deal that created the nation’s largest utility. After hearing testimony from Rogers, Johnson and members of the Duke board from both companies, the North Carolina Utilities Commission chairman said the panel was not ready to “impose some sort of remedy” and the investigation will continue. Commission Chairman Edward Finley indicated the NCUC had the power to reconsider its order granting approval of the merger, or to force Duke to re-install Johnson as CEO. “It’s been told to us that we didn’t include in our order a requirement that the person who was told to us would be CEO (actually) would be the CEO for some reasonable time,” he said. Gray said regulatory moves to alter the merger order would damage the company, which has promised to deliver $650 million in savings to North Carolina’s power consumers in coming years. Duke again criticized the proceedings, especially Finley’s refusal to allow its lawyers to question Johnson. “The Commission has a responsibility to the State of North Carolina to investigate objectively, and its proceedings so far do not remotely satisfy fundamental fairness that due process compels,” Duke lawyer Carter Phillips, a partner at Sidley Austin LLP, said in a statement. Finley said an evidentiary hearing will likely occur later, but suggested a settlement could resolve the investigation sooner. “We never rule out settlement as a resolution,” Finley said before adjourning the hearing. Gray testified under oath that Johnson got off to a rocky start even ahead of the companies’ announcement that they planned to merge, when he gave a presentation in 2010 and discussed how he liked to operate. “He did describe himself as an individual who likes to learn but not to be taught. That was an expression that stayed with the board,” Gray said. Gray said she and board member Dan DiMicco, the CEO of steelmaker Nucor (NUE.N), were both concerned about Johnson after that initial meeting. Gray’s testimony largely echoed Rogers’ comment to the NCUC that it was Johnson’s management style, the issues around Progress’s Crystal River nuclear plant and the poor performance of other Progress nuclear plants that eroded the Duke board’s confidence in Johnson. Rogers, who is also Duke’s chairman, also testified that it was Gray who first brought board’s concerns about Johnson to him in the months ahead of the deal’s closing, but that he was excluded from the decision to oust him. As regulatory approvals dragged on, the Duke board judged information provided by Progress on the status of repairs at the Crystal River plant as lacking. Duke’s board requested that Johnson set up a face-to-face meeting with Rogers and the head of Nuclear Electric Insurance Ltd (NEIL) to discuss a claim Progress filed with NEIL, but it only yielded a telephone call with NEIL nine weeks later. NEIL insures the nuclear operations of electric utilities. That type of delay to a board request would never have happened inside Duke, she said. “You’d never go radio silent for nine weeks like that,” she said. “I think a number of the Duke directors were stunned.” On Thursday, Johnson testified before the commission that he believed Duke tried to back out of the deal after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in December imposed expensive requirements on the companies to reduce their market power. Duke has denied it sought to scuttle the deal, and said it made every effort to comply with the merger agreement. Duke director Michael Browning testified Friday he was surprised to hear Johnson’s version of events. Even with the unfavorable FERC ruling, “we were always committed to closing the transaction,” Browning said. Marie McKee, a Progress board member who joined the Duke board, testified on Thursday that she felt blindsided by Gray’s quick effort to remove Johnson after the deal had closed. She testified that Gray refused to elaborate on the reasons for Johnson’s removal during an hour-long board discussion and would only say the Progress CEO was not a “good fit.” Shares of Duke, which have dropped more than 5 percent since the deal closed, rose 10 cents Friday to close at $66.22 a share.

84,DUK,UPDATE 3-Two Duke Energy board members step down over CEO switch,"July 27 (Reuters) - Two Duke Energy board members resigned on Friday in protest against the utility company’s surprise ousting of new CEO Bill Johnson early this month, just hours after it closed the purchase of Progress Energy. Theresa M. Stone and John D. Baker II, who both joined the Duke board from Progress, submitted their resignations and called for the Duke board to immediately set in place a process to find a new CEO to replace Jim Rogers. Duke bought Progress in an $18 billion deal that created the biggest utility in the United States, and was scrutinized by federal and state regulators for 18 months. The companies had maintained that Progress’ Johnson would take the CEO role in the new company throughout that regulatory review process, although Duke directors have since said they started to have concerns about Johnson far before the deal closed. Debt rating agency Standard & Poor’s cut Duke’s corporate rating on Wednesday to “BBB+” from “A-“ and gave it a negative outlook, citing a heightened risk of regulatory action over the CEO switch. In her resignation letter, Stone said the CEO switch had created worries about corporate governance at Duke, which now faces “major hurdles in restoring trust and confidence.” “I believe the company needs to review its corporate governance and to take steps to address any deficiencies,” she wrote. Duke did not comment on the issues raised by Stone and Baker in their letters, but said its board had accepted the resignations on Friday. “We look forward to working with the entire Board to continue the integration process to drive the significant benefits for customers and shareholders that this combination creates,” the company said in a statement. The quick CEO switch has drawn a sharp rebuke from regulators in North Carolina, who have grilled Rogers and other Duke board members in hearings earlier this month and threatened to reconsider their approval of the merger. The Progress representatives who joined the board of the combined company have complained that they were blindsided by the ouster of Johnson, engineered by the carried-over Duke members of the board on July 2 just minutes after the merger closed. In addition to Stone and Baker, two other former Progress board members told the North Carolina regulators last week they were considering resigning. One of those board members, Marie McKee, said the ex-Progress directors had argued against ousting Johnson for an hour during the July 2 executive session of the board, but failed swing any votes from the legacy Duke directors. In a hearing called by the North Carolina Utilities Commission last week, Johnson said Duke Energy Co felt “buyer’s remorse” and sought to back out of the deal to buy Progress Energy after federal regulators called for costly measures to curb the merged company’s market power. But Ann Maynard Gray, the lead independent Duke director, told NCUC that a lack of disclosure about costly repairs to Progress’ Crystal River nuclear plant and his “controlling” management style prompted Duke’s board to seek his resignation Duke’s shares closed up 0.2 percent to $67.45 per share on the New York Stock Exchange.",7272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/duke-board/update-3-two-duke-energy-board-members-step-down-over-ceo-switch-idUSL2E8IRA0D20120727

87,DUK,"Duke Energy delays Crystal River decision, Edwardsport startup","HOUSTON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - The future of Duke Energy’s  idle Crystal River nuclear plant may not be determined until next year, Duke Chief Executive Jim Rogers said on Thursday. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke Energy became the largest electric utility and second-largest nuclear operator in the nation last month when Duke acquired Raleigh, North Carolina-based Progress Energy in an $18 billion merger. The nearly three-year shutdown of Crystal River and issues at other Progress-owned nuclear units played a role in the surprise ouster of Bill Johnson, the Progress executive who had been slated to lead the merged company. Rogers, who was named CEO instead, told analysts during the company’s quarterly earnings call that the company is negotiating with state regulators in North Carolina over Johnson’s controversial exit. Rogers said that he is not prepared to decide the future of Crystal River by year end as Progress officials had agreed to do in a settlement agreement with Florida utility regulators early this year. However, he said Crystal River “is a high priority for Duke and the customers we serve.” The plant has been shut since 2009 due to serious cracks found in the containment building walls. Rogers said preliminary results from the independent review launched by worried Duke board members shows that the Progress plan to remove and replace large concrete wall sections at Crystal River “appears technically feasible, but issues remain and engineering and risk assessment continue.” He said a cost estimate of the repair option made in 2011 of $900 million to $1.3 billion is “trending higher.” Officials would not be more specific. Rogers also said that testing needed at its 618-megawatt Edwardsport integrated coal-gasification combined cycle plant in Indiana will delay commercial operation of the plant into 2013, from September.",8022012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-duke-crystalriver/duke-energy-delays-crystal-river-decision-edwardsport-startup-idUSL2E8J29KH20120802
88,DUK,Duke CEO says in settlement talks with NC officials,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy is in negotiations with North Carolina regulators and the state attorney general over its controversial ousting of its former chief executive in the hours after it closed its takeover of Progress Energy, its CEO said on Thursday. Jim Rogers, who was returned to the top job at Duke after the board sought the resignation of his replacement, would not comment on the nature of the talks with the North Carolina Utilities Commission, which held hearings on the surprise CEO switch last month. “I can’t speculate on the outcome of the commission’s investigations, or on the settlement discussions we’re engaged in now,” Rogers told Reuters in an interview. He did say that representatives of Bill Johnson, the Progress Energy CEO who was long slated to take the helm of the merged company, were not involved in the negotiations. “We continue to work closely and maintain an open dialogue with the commission, and we’ll just work our way through it,” he said. The Public Staff of the NCUC declined to comment on the negotiations, and a lawyer at the NCUC was not available. Duke’s $18 billion purchase of Progress Energy created the nation’s largest power utility, but its rapid move to remove Johnson sparked outrage in North Carolina, the company’s biggest market. The chairman of the North Carolina Utilities Commission has said the regulator could revisit its approval of the merger and potentially install Johnson in the CEO job, although such a move was seen as unlikely. Analysts have speculated the company could launch a search process for a new CEO to replace Rogers, a move that could be appease the regulators. Still, the company is likely to face a chill in its relations with the NCUC, which sets profit margins of the power utilities in the state. In a conference call, Rogers said the NCUC had always fairly evaluated its proposals around electricity rates in the past, and he expected no change in the future. The company expects to file two separate proposals to change rates in North Carolina by the end of the year. Duke said on Wednesday it had filed a request with the NCUC to cut rates by $89 million over the coming year as part of its planned $650 million in savings over five years from the merger. Duke announced on Thursday that its second-quarter profit rose on revised customer rates in the Carolinas and lower storm restoration costs in a unit.

94,DUK,Duke Energy says Crystal River nuclear repair could exceed $3 billion,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Returning the damaged Crystal River nuclear unit in Florida to service could cost $3 billion and take eight years, according to an independent review of repair options commissioned by Duke Energy as it pursued a merger with Progress Energy earlier this year, the utility said in a filing Monday. The three-year shutdown of the 838-megawatt Crystal River reactor became an issue in the weeks before the merger was completed in July and played a role in the surprise ouster of Bill Johnson, the Progress executive who had been slated to lead the merged companies, executives and board members have said. Progress Energy Florida supplied the Crystal River report prepared by Zapata to Florida regulators Monday, said incoming utility president Alex Glenn, adding that no decision has been made whether to fix Crystal River or to retire the unit. Progress said the review found that a repair plan developed by Progress “appears to be technically feasible, but significant risks and technical issues” remain unresolved. Zapata estimated that repair cost at $1.49 billion, above Progress Energy’s estimate of $900 million to $1.3 billion. Zapata also prepared an estimate for more extensive work based on other scenarios. A worst-case scenario that included eventual replacement of the plant’s dome and containment building walls came in at $3.43 billion, with an eight-year time frame. The reactor has been shut since 2009 due to serious cracks found in the containment building walls. Progress had said the unit might return to service in 2014 if repaired. “We will proceed with a repair option only if there is a high degree of confidence that the repair can be successfully completed and licensed within the final estimated costs and schedule, and is in the best interests of our customers, joint owners and investors,” Glenn said in a statement. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke Energy became the largest electric utility and second-largest nuclear operator in the nation last month when it acquired Raleigh, North Carolina-based Progress Energy in an $18 billion merger. Duke Chairman James Rogers has said the decision to repair or retire Crystal River may not be made before the end of 2012 as the utility had agreed to do in a settlement with Florida utility regulators earlier this year. Under that pact, the utility would be able to pass along to customers the cost to replace Crystal River’s output through 2016 if repair work began before the end of 2012. If repairs begin later, the utility agreed to refund replacement power costs up to $40 million in 2015 and $60 million in 2016. If the Crystal River reactor is retired, also an expensive option, the utility will be able to recover its remaining investment in the plant from its 1.6 million customers, according to the settlement. Any insurance proceeds would be applied to replacement power costs first.

96,DUK,Duke Energy tests Indiana coal power plant for 2013 start,"* Plant virtually complete, costs $3.3 billion * Duke retired three old coal units at plant in 2011 * Tells public flares will be seen, heard during testing By Scott DiSavino Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. power company Duke Energy Corp  said construction of its 618-megawatt (MW) Edwardsport coal-fired power plant in Indiana was “virtually complete” and testing was under way to prepare the facility to begin operating next year. The $3.3-billion plant has produced electricity using natural gas, and was close to running coal through gasification equipment, Duke said in a statement earlier this week. Edwardsport is one of just a few integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants in the United States. IGCC technology converts coal into synthetic gas that is burned in the gas turbines to make electricity. The gasification process strips out pollutants such as sulfur from the coal before burning the gas. Over the summer, Duke said it would delay commercial operation of the Edwardsport plant from September to 2013. Since it was first proposed, the estimated cost of the project has increased from about $1.98 billion to about $3.3 billion now, which includes financing. Indiana regulators approved Duke’s proposal to build the new plant at Edwardsport in 2007. That plan included the retirement, in 2011, of three small coal-fired units at the 160-MW site that were built in the 1940s and 1950s. Edwardsport is located about 100 miles (161 km) southwest of Indianapolis, the Indiana state capital. The company issued the statement this week to notify the public that they may see a bright, and somewhat loud, gas flare from the plant, which will be especially noticeable at night. If the synthetic gas produced in the gasification process does not meet certain standards, Duke said the gas will be diverted to the gas flare tower on the plant property, where it will be ignited and burned safely. The company has not yet run coal through the gasification equipment, so there have not been any flares, Angeline Protogere, a spokeswoman at Duke, told Reuters Thursday. Duke said the gas flare will also be used during each start-up and shut-down of the plant. The flare will last only as long as it takes to shut down the coal gasification process, usually less than 30 minutes. “I want to emphasize that whenever the gas flare is activated, it does not indicate any emergency at the plant,” Edwardsport Plant Manager Jack Stultz, said in a statement. “It is a normal part of plant operations. Because the gas flare may need to be activated quickly, we won’t be able to provide advance notice to local residents. We appreciate everyone’s understanding and patience,” Stultz said. There will be gas flare events during the testing and start-up process over the next several months. The plant will also use the flare during regular commercial service, but it should not be as frequent as during testing and startup, Duke said.

99,DUK,"Duke Energy profit beats Street, boosted by Progress","(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N), the largest power company in the United States, posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday due to benefits from its summer acquisition of rival Progress Energy. For the third quarter, the company posted net income of $594 million, up from $472 million a year earlier. Earnings per share fell to 85 cents from $1.06 as shares outstanding increased 57 percent, due in part to the Progress deal. Excluding charges to integrate Progress and other one-time items, Duke earned $1.47 per share. By that measure, analysts expected $1.45, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Chief Executive Jim Rogers said Duke is “on track” to hit its 2012 earnings forecast of $4.20 to $4.35 per share, and the integration of the two companies is progressing. “I’ve pretty much stopped speaking outside the company,” Rogers said in an interview. “I’ve been focused internally trying to integrate these two teams. We’re on the way.” The integration has been challenged by the way Rogers was put into his current role. Shortly after the $18 billion Progress Energy deal closed in July, the combined company’s new board said Progress Chief Executive Bill Johnson had resigned and would not be taking the top job at the combined company as had been planned. Rogers, Duke’s CEO as the merger was negotiated, was asked to stay at the helm. The swap left many legacy Progress employees uneasy about the change and about Rogers. Rogers told North Carolina regulators that Duke’s board had grown worried about Johnson’s “autocratic” management style and ability to lead such a large organization. Johnson now runs the Tennessee Valley Authority. Rogers, 65, says he has no plans to leave Duke any time soon. “I’m serving at the pleasure of the board and focused on getting these two companies to come together,” he told Reuters. “Sixty-five, in my judgment, is the new 55.” Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke is the largest U.S. power company, with 57,000 megawatts of generating capacity and 7.1 million electricity customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. Duke is also the second-largest U.S. operator of nuclear power plants. Shares of Duke closed Wednesday at $62.94, down nearly 5 percent this year.

104,DUK,UPDATE 1-Duke settles with North Carolina; CEO to leave in 2013,"Nov 29 (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp said on Thursday that its chief executive would step down in 2013, and it announced a settlement with North Carolina over the company’s leadership after it took over Progress Energy. The dispute began when Duke Chief Executive Jim Rogers assumed control of the combined company after the $18 billion purchase closed in July, even though Bill Johnson of Progress had long been slated to take the helm. The North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) held hearings, and in August Rogers said that he had started settlement talks with the regulator. The parties, including North Carolina public staff and the NCUC, agreed that the settlement announced on Thursday did not represent an admission or acknowledgement of illegal or improper acts by the company, Duke said in a statement. In a separate statement released at the same time, Duke said that Rogers, who has been CEO since 2006 and was the Cinergy CEO for 11 years before it became part of Duke, will retire by the end of 2013, when his employment contract expires. The settlement announcement did not explicitly mention the departure of Rogers, but it said that a special board committee would be created to oversee selection of a successor to Rogers. The committee will also help search for two new board members, after a pair resigned in late July in protest against the ousting of Johnson. The purchase of Progress created the United States’ largest power utility, but the CEO decision sparked outrage in North Carolina, the company’s biggest market. The settlement on Thursday must be approved by the NCUC, which sets profit margins of power utilities in the state. Other commitments by Duke in the settlement include maintaining at least 1,000 employees in Raleigh, North Carolina, and guaranteeing certain fuel and fuel-related cost savings for customers in the state. There are also some executive changes that include moving Lloyd Yates, executive vice president for customer operations, into the position of executive vice president for regulated utilities, and appointing a new general counsel. Duke will also need to retain the former general counsel of Progress to advise it for two years on regulatory and legislative matters in North Carolina, the company said.",11292012,http://www.reuters.com/article/dukeenergy-northcarolina/update-1-duke-settles-with-north-carolina-ceo-to-leave-in-2013-idUSL1E8MTGZG20121129

106,DUK,"Florida approves $540 mln in new nuclear costs for NextEra, Duke","* Florida law allows early recovery of nuclear costs * FPL says Turkey Point expansion still cost-effective * Crystal River concessions offset Duke’s recovery charges HOUSTON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Florida regulators this week approved requests from the state’s two largest utilities to charge customers $540 million to boost nuclear generation in the state - $417 million to increase output at existing reactors and $123 million tied to new reactors that won’t come online for a decade or more. The Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) approved separate requests by NextEra Energy’s Florida Power & Light, the state’s largest utility, for $397 million in extra revenue to pay for increased output, called “uprates,” at three reactors and to develop two new reactors. The PSC also voted to allow Duke Energy’s Progress Energy Florida, the state’s second-largest utility, to charge an additional $143 million t o recover its nuclear costs, including $102.7 million for Progress’ two new proposed reactors. The commission’s action may mean higher bills next year for FPL customers, while bills for Progress’ customers are likely to fall due to concessions related to Duke’s damaged Crystal River nuclear reactor, according to the commission. Florida is one of a handful of U.S. states with laws that encourage new nuclear plants by allowing utilities to recover certain costs ahead of plants coming online since nuclear licensing and construction can take many years. Florida’s 2006 law also lets utilities recover early costs to expand output at existing reactors. Costly nuclear plants, however, now face stiff competition from natural gas-fired plants which have become more economical as record gas production has cut the fuel’s price outlook and historic volatility. Lower growth in U.S. power demand and safety concerns after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan have also reduced industry expectations for new U.S. reactors. An environmental group challenging Florida’s law allowing early nuclear cost recovery criticized the commission’s actions and labeled the costs a “nuclear tax” for p o wer supply that may never be built. Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said the commission’s acceptance of P SC s taff recommendations is “an unfortunate trend of rubber-stamping that we have seen year after year in spite of major obstacles and pitfalls that have made new reactor proposals in Florida less and less feasible.” Most of the amount the PSC approved for Florida Power & Light’s (FPL) 4.6 million customers will pay for work to boost the output at the utility’s existing nuclear plants by an estimated 526 to 536 megawatts. The PSC approved an additional $246 million revenue to pay for uprates completed at three reactors: two at the St. Lucie plant on Hutchinson Island, 110 miles (177 km) north of Miami; and one unit at the Turkey Point nuclear station in Florida City, 25 miles south of Miami. Work is ongoing to add capacity at Turkey Point 4. The increase translates into an extra $2.59 in base rates per 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electric use on FPL monthly bills  next year, regulators said in a release. Overall, FPL pegged the cost of adding the 500-plus MW at between $2.95 billion and $3.15 billion, or more than $5,500 per kilowatt. The high capital costs for the nuclear uprate will be offset over the years by lower fuel costs. FPL customers will save $114 million in fuel costs in the first year and $3.8 billion over the life of the plants due to the increased output, said commissioner Eduardo Balbis. “Customers can start realizing these benefits,” said Balbis. “This is something we need to applaud.” In addition, the commission approved FPL’s request to recover $151.5 million under the 2006 nuclear cost recovery statute. That includes $131 million for the uprate work and $20.3 million for development of two new reactors at Turkey Point. That translates into $1.65 per month for each 1,000 kwh used by FPL customers, a utility spokesman said, 55 cents below the current charge. While the two nuclear related charges total $4.28 per 1,000 kwh, other pending PSC rate action may mean FPL bills rise by less than that amount in mid-2013. In filings, FPL said its plan to build Turkey Point Units 6 and 7, totaling 2,200 megawatts, will cost between $12.8 billion and $18.7 billion. Completion of the units could occur in 2022 and 2023, the company said. FPL told regulators the new Turkey Point reactors remain cost-effective compared to gas-fired generation despite falling gas prices. However, PSC staff noted that the nuclear project might not be economical if capital costs “approach” FPL’s high estimate of $5,200 per kw and gas prices remain low. At Duke’s Progress Florida unit which has 1.6 million customers, the PSC approved a nuclear recovery increase of $143 million. That includes $102.7 million for Progress’ two proposed reactors in Levy County and $40 million to expand output at the Crystal River 3 reactor in Citrus County, even though it has been shut since 2009 due to a series of cracks found in the containment building walls. Duke executives have not decided whether to repair or retire the Crystal River plant due to the extensive damage. The nuclear costs translate into a $4.79 per 1,000 kwh per month increase for Progress Florida customers, but the amount was more than offset by other regulatory action to include potential insurance proceeds covering lost output from Crystal River, deferral of some uprate costs and overall cheaper gas. The latest estimate to build the 2,200-MW Levy station is $24.1 billion, with startup dates in 2024 and 2025, according to Progress filings.",11292012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-nuclear-florida/florida-approves-540-mln-in-new-nuclear-costs-for-nextera-duke-idUSL1E8MT7ID20121129
107,DUK,Regulators aim to restore balance of power with Duke deal,"(Reuters) - North Carolina utility regulators’ No. 1 goal in negotiating a settlement with Duke Energy Corp and board shake-up: restore the spirit of the original Duke-Progress Energy merger. The agreement, which outlines Chief Executive Jim Rogers’ retirement when his contract expires in December 2013, calls for two new independent board members, a mandatory retirement age of 71 and provisions to protect legacy Progress employees. Given that North Carolina is Duke’s largest market, the settlement shows that state’s regulators are willing to flex their muscle well beyond routine electricity rate-setting hearings. “They’re not IBM or Exxon, they’re a regulated utility,” Robert Gruber, executive director of the public staff of the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC), said of Duke. “It’s appropriate for the commission to regulate the merger.” The commission felt slighted when Rogers took control of the combined company in July after the $18 billion buyout of Progress closed, according to commission hearing testimony. When the deal was first announced in January 2011, commissioners had been told Bill Johnson of Progress would take the helm of what became the largest U.S. power utility. The unexpected move to replace Johnson within hours of the deal’s closure caught many off guard, and quickly became a hot-button topic throughout North Carolina and on Wall Street. Johnson is slated to become CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority in January. “What the commission is trying to do here is restore some of the balance that the original merger contemplated before the board took over and threw Johnson out,” said Gruber. Johnson’s exit prompted the commission to immediately launch an investigation. The settlement announced on Thursday night hinged little on Rogers, as the Duke board had not talked about Rogers staying on past the end of his contract, according to a person close to the company. The commission had always expected Rogers would retire when his contract expired, Gruber said. Still, in negotiations with the utility commission Duke pushed back over required lower-level management changes and opposed regulatory intervention into its corporate governance. But ultimately the company decided it wanted to put the issue behind it, the person said. Duke had already formed a search committee to find Rogers’ replacement earlier this fall and has hired executive search firm Russell Reynolds Associates, the person said. Russell Reynolds didn’t return phone calls seeking comment. The search committee originally formed by Duke had seven members: four legacy Duke directors and three legacy Progress directors. With the settlement, the committee will now have eight members, split equally between the legacy companies. When a new board member joins Duke, he or she will join the search committee, according to the settlement. “Whether or not you agree that a commission should be able to dictate management changes and board changes, I think an independent CEO and board member will be a good step in improving overall stewardship,” Morningstar analyst Andrew Bischof said. The market seemed to echo that sentiment, as shares of Duke traded up more than 2 percent on the day, outperforming the broader market. “This hopefully moves the commission and Duke forward,” said Sam Watson, general counsel for the NCUC. Duke declined to say which board members will constitute the search committee. Through a spokesman, Rogers declined to comment. Charles Pryor Jr, a former Progress Energy board member who voted for the merger and is prohibited by the settlement from re-joining the board, expressed hope the company would move beyond the recent controversy. “Whatever Duke’s obligations are under the regulatory compact, obviously the commission felt that they fell short,” Pryor said. “That’s the basis upon which all the other terms of the agreement were set down.” The North Carolina Utilities Commission is facing change itself. Two of the seven commissioners have terms that expire in June. Edward Finley’s term as chairman of the commission also expires in June, although his term as commissioner extends to June 2019. Gruber, the executive director of the commission’s public staff, which advocates for consumers, has said he plans to retire next year. The incoming North Carolina governor, Republican Pat McCrory, who would appoint new commissioners, is a former Duke Energy employee.

109,DUK,Duke settles with North Carolina; CEO leaves end of 2013,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp’s (DUK.N) chief executive will step down at the end of 2013 as part of a settlement with North Carolina regulators over the utility’s leadership after it took over Progress Energy. The dispute began when Duke CEO Jim Rogers assumed control of the combined company after the $18 billion purchase closed in July, even though Bill Johnson of Progress had long been slated to take the helm of what became the largest U.S. power utility. The CEO decision sparked outrage in North Carolina, the company’s biggest market, and the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC) started holding hearings on the change just a week after the deal closed. Rogers then started settlement talks with the regulator in August. “With his consent and in order to assist with the resolution of these matters, Mr. Rogers has chosen to retire on December 31, 2013, as he originally planned,” said the settlement document, posted online by the NCUC on Thursday. The parties agreed that the settlement did not represent an admission or acknowledgement of illegal or improper acts by the company. Rogers has been Duke’s CEO since 2006, and had been the CEO of Cinergy for 11 years before it became part of Duke. Duke said his retirement would coincide with the expiry of his employment contract. As part of the settlement, a board committee would be created to oversee selection of a successor to Rogers and help search for two new board members, after a pair resigned in late July in protest against the ousting of Johnson. The CEO search committee would make its “best efforts” to have a recommendation for a new boss by July 1, 2013, and not later than the end of 2013, said the settlement document. The settlement must be approved in full by the NCUC, which sets profit margins of power utilities in the state. Other commitments by Duke include maintaining at least 1,000 employees in Raleigh, North Carolina, for at least five years, as well as guaranteeing certain fuel and fuel-related cost savings for customers in the state. There are also some executive changes that include moving Lloyd Yates, executive vice president for customer operations, into the position of executive vice president for regulated utilities, and naming a new general counsel by the end of 2012. Duke will also need to retain the former general counsel of Progress to advise it for two years on regulatory and legislative matters in North Carolina, the company said.

113,DUK,Duke says three new North Carolina power plants enter service,"Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. power company Duke Energy Corp  said Thursday three new power plants in North Carolina entered service in December, allowing the company to retire several old coal plants. The three plants are the 825-megawatt (MW) Cliffside 6 coal-fired unit and the 920-MW H.F. Lee and 620-MW Dan River natural gas fired plants. Duke said in a release the new plants represented a combined investment of nearly $3.65 billion and were completed within budget. The company said the new unit at Cliffside allowed it to retire four 1940s-era coal units at the site totaling 198 MW in October 2011, and to commit to retiring another 1,469 MW of older coal generation in North Carolina. Duke also said it upgraded the existing 562-MW Unit 5 at Cliffside by adding a scrubber in 2011 to reduce sulfur and other acid gases. With the retirements and upgrades, Duke said the Cliffside site now generates more than twice the electricity with 80 percent less sulfur dioxide and half the nitrogen oxide and mercury than it did previously. Progress Energy Carolinas, a unit of Duke, retired three older coal units totaling 382 MW and four combustion turbines at the H.F. Lee Plant earlier this fall. Duke also said it retired 276 MW of coal capacity at the Dan River site in the spring of 2012 and all three older combustion turbines in the autumn. Duke said construction is also under way at the 625-MW natural gas combined-cycle facility at the Sutton plant in North Carolina, where 575 MW of older coal-fired generation will be retired. The new Sutton gas plant is expected to enter service by the end of 2013. In addition to investing nearly $6 billion in new plants since 2007 and retiring as much as 6,800 MW of older coal capacity, Duke said it has invested another $7.5 billion for plant upgrades to reduce emissions. Separately, Duke expects its 618-MW Edwardsport coal gasification plant in Indiana to enter commercial service in mid 2013. The $3.3 billion plant has already produced electricity in test mode.

114,DUK,Duke nearing decision to fix or retire Florida reactor-regulator,"Jan 7 (Reuters) - Duke Energy officials may be near a decision on whether to invest billions to repair the damaged Crystal River nuclear plant in Florida or to shut and decommission it, a Florida regulator said on Monday. The 838-megawatt Crystal River reactor has been shut for more than three years due to the complex nature of work needed to repair a series of cracks that occurred after the containment building walls were opened to allow replacement of the reactor’s steam generators. Florida Public Service Commissioner Eduardo Balbis pressed the company and other parties in the case on the timing of the nuclear decision as it will affect several regulatory cases scheduled to be heard at the agency this year. “We have a decision that’s coming soon,” said Balbis who is overseeing status conferences on Crystal River. “I’m glad it’s coming soon, whichever way it goes, because there are things that need to happen at that point. This is an important issue.” A technical team at Duke’s Florida utility - Progress Energy Florida - is a week or two away from submitting its draft report evaluating repair options for the Crystal River reactor to the company’s chief nuclear officer, John Burnett of Progress told the commissioner at a status meeting Monday. The chief nuclear officer will send the report to senior management, then to the Duke board, meaning a decision to repair or retire the utility’s only nuclear plant could be made by this summer, Burnett said, declining to be more specific. The prolonged shutdown of Crystal River and uncertainty over the cost and feasibility of its repair became a point of contention between Duke board members and former Progress Chief Executive Bill Johnson in the final weeks before Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke finalized its $18 billion merger with Progress Energy in July. At one point, Progress had said Crystal River might return to service in 2014 at a cost of $1.3 billion, but skeptical Duke directors ordered an independent review of the situation prior to the merger’s closing. That review revealed that the repair bill could exceed $3 billion and take eight years. Under a settlement agreement with Florida regulators, Progress had planned to make the repair/retire decision by the end of last year, but Duke Chairman Jim Rogers said the decision would likely take longer. Another unresolved question that will play into Duke’s decision relates to how an insurance claim covering Crystal River will be handled by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), an industry-sponsored insurance company, that is facing a number of costly claims. Burnett said a mediation process related to the insurance claims is ongoing. He said two sessions with a mediator have been held without an agreement. While another session has not been scheduled, Burnett said neither the mediator, nor the parties have declared an impasse.",1072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-duke-crystalriver/duke-nearing-decision-to-fix-or-retire-florida-reactor-regulator-idUSL1E9C77YQ20130107
115,DUK,TEXT - Fitch rates Duke Energy Corp junior subordinated notes,"Jan 9 - Fitch Ratings has assigned a ‘BBB-‘ rating to Duke Energy Corp.’s  (DUK) new $500 million issue of 5.125% junior subordinated debentures due Jan. 15, 2073. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The debentures will be unsecured and will rank junior and be subordinated in right of payment and  upon liquidation to all senior indebtedness of DUK.   A portion of the proceeds will be used to fund the redemption of the $300  million of 7.1% Cumulative Quarterly Income Preferred Securities due 2039,  Series A, issued by DUK’s indirect subsidiary FPC Capital I. The remaining net  proceeds will be used to repay commercial paper, fund capital expenditures of  DUK’s unregulated businesses and for general corporate purposes.   So long as there is no event of default under the subordinated indenture, DUK  has the right to defer interest payments on the debentures for up to 10  consecutive years on more than one occasion. Deferred interest payments will  accumulate interest at a rate equal to the interest on the junior subordinated  debentures. DUK may redeem the debentures at any time at the applicable  redemption price.   The securities are eligible for 50% equity credit under Fitch’s applicable  criteria ‘Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT  Credit Analysis’, dated Dec. 12. 2012. Key features supporting the equity credit are the junior subordinated ranking, the option to defer interest payments on a  cumulative basis for up to 10-years on each occasion, and 60-year maturity.  Key Rating Drivers  Utility Operations: The ratings are supported by the credit strength and cash  flow diversity of DUK’s six regulated utility subsidiaries operating in six  states. Utility operations are expected to provide approximately 85% of  consolidated earnings and cash flow. DUK’s two largest and financially sound  utility subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy Carolinas (Fitch IDR of ‘A-‘ for both companies), will account for approximately 55% - 60% of  utility earnings.   Financial Flexibility: The ratings incorporate DUK’s increased scale and  enhanced financial flexibility following the 2012 merger with Progress Energy  Corp. (PGN). Longer term, economies of scale and the geographic proximity of the service territories should create synergy opportunities that strengthen credit  quality measures.   Credit Metrics: In 2013, the first full year of operation for the combined  entity, Fitch estimates consolidated EBITDA/interest, FFO/interest and FFO/debt  of approximately 4.75x, 5.0x, and 20%, respectively, which is consistent with  Fitch’s target ratios for ‘BBB+’ issuers and DUK’s peer group of utility parent  companies. Debt/EBITDA, however, will be somewhat weak for the rating category  with 2013 Debt/EBITDA projected by Fitch to be about 4.25x, trending down to  about 4.0x over the next two years.    Construction Expenditures: Consolidated capital expenditures should decline in  2013, as several electric generation modernization projects enter service.  Expenditures then begin to increase in 2014 due, in part, to rising  environmental expenditures and potential electric generation additions.   Capital and Operating Cost Recovery: Tariff increases are expected in several  jurisdictions in 2013 that should enhance consolidated earnings and cash flow  measures. Fitch expects tariff adjustments for Duke Energy Carolinas (DEC) and  Progress Energy Carolinas (PEC) in both their North Carolina and South Carolina  jurisdictions, primarily to recover capital investments. Electric and gas rate  increases are also expected for Duke Energy Ohio in 2013, while Progress Energy  Florida (PEF) raised electric rates effective Jan. 1, 2013.   Liquidity: DUK has ample liquidity to meet its operational needs and debt  refinancing requirements, but will require continued capital market access. A $6 billion, five-year master credit facility expires in November 2016. The credit  facility supports DUK’s $2.2 billion commercial paper program.  Crystal River 3 Outage: Fitch believes it is unlikely management will elect to  repair Crystal River 3 (CR3) given the rising cost estimates, construction risks and low gas-price environment, and instead will pursue the retirement option and recovery of invested capital (see settlement agreement below).  The unit has  been out of service since September 2009.   Florida Rate Settlement Agreement: A rate settlement agreement approved by the  Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC) establishes a framework for the  treatment of CR3 costs. Importantly, the agreement allows the recovery of  on-going replacement power costs. In addition, if PEF decides to retire CR3, the parties to the settlement agreed not to challenge the full recovery of all plant investment. Partly, offsetting the positive elements of the settlement agreement are provisions for rate refunds of $388 million of CR3 replacement power costs  (primarily in 2013 and 2014), a lower than expected rate increase in 2013, a  rate freeze through 2016 and the removal of CR3 from rate base. The rate refunds include $40 million in 2015 and $60 million in 2016 due to its inability to  start repairs in 2012.    High Parent Leverage: The acquisition of the more levered PGN increases the  proportion of debt at the parent level (DUK plus PGN). Pre-merger, Duke had  approximately 20% of its $23 billion consolidated debt at the parent level,  compared to about 33% for PGN. Post-merger parent debt (DUK plus PGN) is  expected to approximate 25% - 27% of consolidated debt.  Achieving synergies: DUK is at risk for achieving system fuel savings included  as part of the PGN merger settlement agreement with the North Carolina Public  Service Commission. The companies agreed to guarantee $650 million in system  fuel savings for Carolina retail customers over the next five years (plus an  additional 18 months if coal consumption at certain plants is less than  originally forecast due to low gas prices).    What Could Trigger a Rating Action  Adverse Regulatory Outcomes: Lack of rate support for DEC’s fleet modernization  program poses the greatest downside risk to ratings. The company has invested  heavily to replace aging power plants and to comply with environmental  regulations and is dependent on continued rate support to maintain ratings   Crystal River 3 Repair: A decision to repair CR3 without assured regulatory  recovery would strain credit protection measures and could adversely affect  ratings.",1092013,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNB293020130109

117,DUK,Barclays boss tells staff: adopt new values or leave,"LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays’ (BARC.L) new boss has told staff they should leave if they do not want to sign up to a set of standards aimed at rebuilding the British bank’s reputation after a string of scandals. Antony Jenkins, who took over as chief executive at the end of August after the bank was rocked by an interest rate rigging scandal, said bonuses and performance would be assessed against a new “Purpose and Values” blueprint. “I have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of you ... will enthusiastically support this move. But there might be some who don’t feel they can fully buy in to an approach which so squarely links performance to the upholding of our values,” Jenkins said in a memo to his 140,000 staff on Thursday. “My message to those people is simple: Barclays is not the place for you. The rules have changed. You won’t feel comfortable at Barclays and, to be frank, we won’t feel comfortable with you as colleagues.” Barclays Plc’s reputation was hammered after it was fined 290 million pounds ($464 million) in June for rigging Libor interest rates, which unearthed long-standing concerns by Britain’s financial regulator about its culture. It and other UK banks were also tarnished by scandals involving the mis-selling of financial products. Jenkins, who took over after Bob Diamond stepped down in the wake of the Libor scandal, said he was putting five values at the heart of his plan: respect, integrity, service, excellence and stewardship. He will unveil his strategic plans on February 12 - which he said would “excite” staff on what the future holds - but he added that setting new standards was equally important to the bank’s long-term success. “The behavior which made those headlines in 2012 took place in the past. But it helped underline how banking as a whole had lost its way, and had lost touch with the values on which reputation and trust were built,” he said in the memo. “Over a period of almost 20 years, banking became too aggressive, too focused on the short-term, too disconnected from the needs of our customers and clients, and wider society. We were not immune at Barclays from these mistakes.” He said bankers pursued short-term profits at the expense of the values and reputation of the organization, and in the coming weeks more than 1,000 staff would be trained to spread the new values and embed them throughout the bank. “Performance assessment will be based not just on what we deliver but on how we deliver it. We must never again be in a position of rewarding people for making the bank money in a way which is unethical or inconsistent with our values,” he said.

118,DUK,Duke to retire Florida Crystal River nuclear plant,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp, the biggest power company in the United States, said Tuesday its Progress Energy Florida utility will retire the Crystal River nuclear plant in Florida. The plant has already been safely shut down and offline since late 2009 due to damage done to the reactor’s containment structure during a power upgrade and the replacement of the unit’s steam generators. There are currently 104 reactors licensed to operate in the United States. The reactors have a total capacity of about 101,000 megawatts (MW) and generate about 20 percent of the nation’s power. In addition to Crystal River Unit 3, Dominion Resource Inc plans to retire the Kewaunee reactor in Wisconsin over the next few months due primarily to weak natural gas prices from record shale production that has reduced power prices to decades low levels, making the continued operation of Kewaunee uneconomic. Duke said in a release it is reviewing alternatives to replace the power produced by Crystal River, including the potential construction of a new natural gas-fired plant. Duke said the four coal plants at Crystal River with a capacity of 2,291-MW will remain in service. The reactor had a capacity of 860 MW. “We believe the decision to retire the nuclear plant is in the best overall interests of our customers, investors, the state of Florida and our company,” Jim Rogers, CEO of Duke Energy said in a release. “This has been an arduous process of modeling, engineering, analysis and evaluation over many months. The decision was very difficult, but it is the right choice,” Rogers said. Crystal River 3 began operating in 1977 and was shut in the autumn of 2009 for refueling and replacement of its steam generators when a delamination, or crack, occurred in the outer layer of the containment building’s concrete wall. The process of repairing the damage and restoring the unit to service resulted in additional delaminations in other sections of the containment structure in 2011, the company said. During the ensuing months, Progress Energy, which owned the reactor, and Duke Energy merged in July 2012, evaluated the ability to successfully repair the unit, the risks associated with any repair and the repair scope as well as the likely costs and schedule, Duke said. In late 2012, a report confirmed that repairing the plant was a viable option but that the nature and potential scope of repairs brought increased risks that could raise the cost dramatically and extend the schedule. That report found the repair bill could exceed $3 billion and take eight years. In addition, the company and its insurance carrier, Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), have reached a resolution of the company’s coverage claims through a mediation process. Under the terms of the mediator’s proposal, NEIL will pay an additional $530 million. Along with the $305 million NEIL has already paid, customers will receive $835 million in insurance proceeds. This will be the largest claim payout in the history of NEIL, Duke said. “We believe accepting the mediator’s proposal is in the overall best interests of our customers and shareholders, and the monies we receive will go directly to customers to reduce their electric bills,” Rogers said. For the future, Duke expects to put the reactor into “a safe storage configuration, requiring limited staffing to monitor plant conditions, until the eventual dismantling and decontamination activities occur, usually in 40 to 60 years.” To meet customer needs, Duke said Progress Energy Florida will continue to serve customers reliably as it has through the extended outage, in the coming years through a combination of power generation, energy efficiency and purchasing electricity in the market. The company said it was evaluating the potential to build a new gas plant that could come online as early as 2018, noting there was no definite plan for new generating capacity at this time. The company did not mention in its release Tuesday the proposed construction of a new nuclear plant in Levy County, Florida, near the Crystal River plant. In 2012 before the merger with Duke, Progress said it delayed the proposed in service date for the Levy county nuclear power plant to 2024 with a second unit following 18 months later. The company also boosted the cost estimate for the 2,200-MW project to between $19 billion and $24 billion. About 600 full-time employees work at the reactor. Many will remain onsite to work through the closing and decommissioning of the unit, Duke said, noting it will work with employees to help as many as possible make the transition to positions in other Duke organizations.

The plant passed into Duke’s hands last year when it acquired Raleigh, North Carolina-based Progress Energy for $18 billion, making it the largest electric utility and second-largest nuclear operator in the United States. The shutdown of the reactor played a role in the surprise ouster of Bill Johnson, the Progress executive who had been slated to lead the merged company.

122,DUK,Retired Duke reactor may signal more U.S. nuclear shutdowns,"NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - A decision by Duke Energy Corp to retire rather than repair its damaged Crystal River reactor in Florida may signal the shutdown of other older U.S. nuclear plants as weak natural gas prices make significant investment in them uneconomical. While energy analysts said the circumstances surrounding Duke’s decision were unique to that plant, decade-low electric prices, especially in deregulated states where the market sets power rates, make it difficult to support costly upgrades on reactors when building gas-fired units is much cheaper. “It is a tough economic environment in the electricity market due to the glut of natural gas, particularly for those that operate in a deregulated environment,” said Tony Pietrangelo, chief nuclear officer of industry trade group Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI). Profit margins for nuclear operators in deregulated markets have decreased over the last few years due to lower power prices and weaker growth in demand since the recession, he told Reuters. Duke, the largest U.S. power company, said on Tuesday that it would retire the Crystal River reactor, which has been shut since 2009, due to rising repair costs and uncertainty about how long it would take to fix a series of cracks in the walls of the reactor containment building. One Duke report found the repair bill for the 860-megawatt (MW) reactor might exceed $3 billion and take up to eight years. By comparison, it would cost about $1 billion to build a similar-sized gas-fired plant in about three years. Duke said it is considering the construction of a new combined cycle gas plant, among other alternatives, to replace the power produced by Crystal River for its more than 1.6 million customers in Florida. “You can buy replacement power much more cheaply today than in the past, and you can install replacement capacity very cheaply, in the form of a combined-cycle plant,” said Sanford C. Bernstein senior analyst Hugh Wynne. Nuclear plants were extremely profitable when gas prices soared in the mid-2000s. The situation reversed course, though, as gas prices began to slump due to a boom in shale production that drove supplies to record highs. The average gas price sank to a 13-year low in 2012. “Gas prices have gotten so low they are challenging the nuclear portfolio,” said UBS energy analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith. “It’s getting tougher for nuclear to compete.” Those weak gas prices helped pull power prices to near-decade lows, making it uneconomical for many generators to invest in their older plants - especially coal-fired units - to keep them compliant with stricter federal environmental regulations. Since 2009, power companies have announced plans to shut more than 40,000 MW of coal-fired capacity in the coming years, and nuclear plants are next. The Kewaunee reactor in Wisconsin is the first nuclear unit to succumb, as owner Dominion Resources Inc plans to shut it this year, partly because of pressure from shale gas. UBS’s Dumoulin-Smith has identified other reactors in danger of shutting, including Entergy Corp’s Vermont Yankee in Vermont and FitzPatrick in New York, Exelon Corp’s Clinton in Illinois and Constellation Energy Nuclear Group LLC’s Ginna in New York. These older reactors operating in deregulated states will find it harder to compete, Dumoulin-Smith said, due to high fixed costs compared with gas plants, expensive safety upgrades needed to implement lessons learned from the Fukushima accident in Japan, and stricter cooling water rules, among other things. The total capacity of those four units, plus Kewaunee and Crystal River, is about 4,500 MW, which is about 4 percent of the nation’s nuclear capacity. New reactors under construction at Southern Co’s Vogtle plant in Georgia, Scana Corp’s Summer in South Carolina and Tennessee Valley Authority’s Watts Bar in Tennessee would more than offset the lost capacity when they enter service over the next several years. Pietrangelo at NEI, however, said those reactors, including Kewaunee, are running well without producing greenhouse gas emissions and are the low-cost producers in their regions. “One of the attributes of deregulated markets is ‘the price rules,’ and they don’t value nuclear like regulated markets do,” Pietrangelo said. “When you are not properly valued, it leads to purely economic decisions and ... a closing can happen,” he said, noting that this was what happened to Kewaunee. Entergy does not comment on the financial performance of individual reactors, said spokesman Rob Williams at Vermont Yankee. “We remain fully focused on the safe operation of our plants today and into the future,” he said. Exelon is not considering closing any nuclear plants, including Clinton, spokesman Krista Lopykinski said. “We do not change our long-term investment decisions based on short-term market fluctuations,” she added. Exelon owns about half of Constellation, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nuclear critics are also calling for the retirement of the troubled San Onofre nuclear station in California, operated by a unit of Edison International. Opponents recently “celebrated” the first year that the state grid operated without the 2,150-MW nuclear plant. Both reactors have been shut since January 2012 due to accelerated wear that affected thousands of tightly packed tubes inside new steam generators. Operator Southern California Edison has proposed a plan to restart San Onofre Unit 2, but warned that more severe damage found in Unit 3 might require a longer, costlier repair. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. Bernstein’s Wynne said a utility must weigh many factors, not just the price tag of the repair, in deciding whether to fix or shut a plant, including a reactor’s age, whether its 40-year license has been renewed, its location and market structure. “Each of these decisions with respect to retirement is pretty much related to the individual characteristics of the plant and the costs of keeping them in service,” said Wynne. Lower gas prices may make the choice between a risky repair and a costly upgrade even harder.

123,DUK,Duke to retire older U.S. coal power plants as new units start,"* Duke, Progress have invested $7 bln in control equipment * Duke CEO wants Congress to put price on carbon emissions * Three North Carolina power plants entered service in 2012 By Scott DiSavino Feb 13 (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp, the biggest U.S. power company, will retire up to 6,800 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired generating capacity by 2015 as part of the company’s multiyear $9 billion fleet modernization program, the company’s CEO said Wednesday. “This program has put us ahead of the curve in our industry in terms of preparing for compliance with stricter environmental regulations,” Jim Rogers, Duke CEO, said on the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call. The modernization program includes construction of the Edwardsport coal plant in Indiana and the Sutton natural gas plant in North Carolina, and three plants in North Carolina that already entered service in 2012, Rogers said. “By building several new natural gas plants, we are increasing our fuel diversity and giving our customers the benefits of low natural gas prices,” Rogers said. The three North Carolina plants that entered service in 2012 were the 920-MW H.F. Lee gas plant, the 620-MW Dan River gas plant and the 825-MW Cliffside 6 coal-fired unit. Rogers said the 618-MW Edwardsport coal gasification plant in Indiana will enter service by midyear. The $3.3 billion plant has already produced electricity in test mode. And, he said, the 625-MW Sutton combined-cycle gas plant would enter service by the end of the year. “These new plants will allow us to retire up to 6,800 MW of older, less-efficient coal-fired units by 2015 and, by the end of this year, we expect to have retired more than 3,800 MW of this capacity,” he said. Rogers said Duke and Progress Energy, which merged with Duke in 2012, have “already invested around $7 billion in control equipment for our existing coal plants, positioning them for compliance with more stringent air emission regulations.” But he estimated the company will spend an additional $5 billion to $6 billion over the next decade to comply with pending environmental regulations on air, water, and coal ash. President Barack Obama in his State of the Union address gave Congress an ultimatum on climate change: craft a plan to slash greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to global warming, or the White House will go it alone. “I continue to believe that the (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)) is not equipped to put a price on carbon. That is going to take legislation,” Rogers said in answer to a question on Obama’s global warming comments. Rogers was one of the first energy executives to support cap-and-trade programs to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gas emissions. To reduce the CO2 emissions, Rogers said shale gas has already been “transformative in terms of the carbon footprint” of the power industry. “We have made tremendous progress at reducing the burden of coal and have increased dramatically the burn of natural gas, which has about 50 percent of the carbon footprint of coal,” Rogers said. He said the United States was already at the same place in terms of CO2 emissions as in 1992. “At the end of the day, they will have to put a price on carbon. That can’t be done by the EPA. That can only be done by Congress, and they need to act,” Rogers said. He said now was a good time for Congress to act because the cost of solar power is dropping and natural gas is cheap due to record shale production. “We are in a period where you could start with a low price on carbon and let it escalates over a much longer period of time, thus minimizing the impact on the economy,” he said.",2132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-duke-earnings/duke-to-retire-older-u-s-coal-power-plants-as-new-units-start-idUSL1N0BDBXQ20130213
124,DUK,Duke Energy profit rises after merger,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N) reported its second consecutive quarterly rise in profit on Wednesday following its acquisition of rival Progress Energy last summer. “We’re in very strong position and have started to harvest the savings that came about from the merger,” CEO Jim Rogers told Reuters. The largest power company in the United States said net income for the fourth quarter was $586 million, or 62 cents per share, compared with $333 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Duke earned 70 cents per share, beating the analysts’ average estimate of 64 cents. In early February, the company retired Crystal River, a damaged nuclear power plant in Florida, because of rising repair costs. “It was a difficult decision. We spent a significant amount of time doing detailed technical and economic feasibility studies. Based on those studies we believe the decision is in the best interest of our customers and co-owners,” said Rogers. Rogers said the company had no definite plans yet to replace the plant, but that it would favor a gas-fired combined plant over other options. The company also recently settled with North Carolina regulators over a probe concerning the sudden resignation of Progress Chief Executive Bill Johnson in the hours after the $18 billion Progress Energy deal closed in June. As part of the settlement, Duke CEO Rogers will step down by the end of the year. Rogers said that he hoped to keep working in the energy industry after he left Duke - only this time, with a humanitarian focus. “I want to bring electricity to the 1.3 billion people who have no access to electricity in the world,” Rogers said. “As CEO of an energy company, might be a perfect mission for me.” The company said it would provide a business outlook for 2013 at an analyst meeting on February 28.

128,DUK,Florida city hopes manatees fill void left by retired nuclear plant,"* Duke Energy says nuclear plant will be retired * Crystal River residents worry about economic impact * Only U.S. spot where people can legally swim with manatees By Saundra Amrhein CRYSTAL RIVER, Fla., Feb 14 (Reuters) - The decision earlier this month to retire a nuclear plant near this small Florida city - potentially costing hundreds of jobs and lost revenue - has residents banking on the lure of the endangered manatee. “We’ll always have tourism, we’ll always have manatees. That’s a huge draw,” said Michele Bunts, manager of Cracker’s Bar, Grill & Tiki, as employees wiped down tables in preparation for the lunch crowd on the deck overlooking the sparkling blue waters of Kings Bay, the headwaters of Crystal River. As the nation’s only place where people can legally swim with manatees, Crystal River draws tourists from around the world for a chance to snorkel with the sea cows, which can be 10 feet long and weigh between 800 and 1,200 lbs (364 to 545 kg). Tourists also enjoy the chance to spot the creatures from a boat or land. Bunts expects that her restaurant, a popular watering hole in this central-west Florida city of about 4,000 people, could see a decline in customers in the wake of Duke Energy Corp’s   announcement last week that it will retire the plant.  Like many of her fellow residents, she hopes that tourists flocking to see the manatees will make up the difference in lost revenue. Residents will have some time to absorb the impact as the process of decommissioning the nuclear plant takes decades, said Sterling Ivey, spokesman for Progress Energy Florida, a subsidiary of Duke. “It’s not like a factory where we lock the doors and everybody gets a pink slip,” he said. The Crystal River nuclear plant had been in operation since 1977, helping serve Duke’s 1.6 million Florida customers. It had already been shut down and offline since 2009 due to structural damage during upgrades to the unit’s steam generators. About 600 people could lose their jobs once the plant is eventually retired, but there will be plenty of work for at least the next five to seven years, said Ivey. The plant would then transition into a “mothballed-type status” for another 20 to 25 years. The Kings Bay manatee refuge, located about 80 miles (129 km) north of Tampa, lies about 8 miles (13 kilometers) south of the nuclear plant complex. The dozens of natural freshwater springs in the bay area are home to hundreds of manatees during winter months as the herbivorous marine mammals escape the chilly waters of the Gulf of Mexico for the 72-degree Fahrenheit warmth of the brackish sanctuary. The manatee’s importance to the town’s tourist industry is on display in front of the tan-brick one-story City Hall - a star-studded replica of the mammal painted red, white and blue. The nuclear plant is on Duke property along with four coal-powered energy plants that are expected operate at least for the next few years. Duke said it was considering alternatives to replace the nuclear plant, including the construction of a new natural gas-fired plant. Duke is the largest employer and taxpayer in Citrus County, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Shutting the nuclear plant would lower the company’s tax bill from $35 million to as little as $13 million, a loss that equals a quarter of the county’s general fund, the paper reported. Residents worry that the closure could further depress the housing market in this rural county dotted by forest preserves, strip malls and manatee attractions. Store and restaurant owners were hoping to recoup lost business if Duke chose to decontaminate the plant, adding more workers. Instead, the company announced on Feb. 5 it planned to pursue another option, safely storing the plant for several decades to let nature help with the decay before cleaning out the rest of the radiation. Crystal River Mayor Jim Farley acknowledged that the county as a whole might take a hit should many employees be reassigned out-of-state and if property tax income drops if Duke does not replace the nuclear facility with a natural gas plant. But he predicted that ongoing plans for the springs will make the area a bigger ecotourism attraction than it already is. “It’s not going to be a disaster,” Farley said. “I think we’re going to be able to cope. We’ll lose some business because of it, probably. These are tough economic times as it is, but we have so much going for us.” Long-term residents roll their eyes at the promises of city-sponsored development of ecotourism. Officials have been saying that for years, said Greg Dristiliaris, deli manager at a Shell gas station. Plant workers once packed the place in the mornings to buy lunch sandwiches and in late afternoons after work to buy food, beer, cigarettes or tobacco, he said. He used to have 30-40 pizzas on hand to sell each day, he said. Now he does not offer pizzas at all. Like the others, Dristiliaris said the most challenging part of the news is the uncertainty of what comes next. But as a long-time Floridian, he compared coping with tumultuous change to another familiar part of life in Florida - hurricanes. “You just got to roll with it,” he said.",2142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-florida-manatees/florida-city-hopes-manatees-fill-void-left-by-retired-nuclear-plant-idUSL1N0BA22E20130214

133,DUK,Duke Energy suspends effort to license N. Carolina nuclear units,"May 2 (Reuters) - Duke Energy, the largest U.S. electric utility, said it notified regulators on Thursday that it will drop plans to build two new nuclear reactors in North Carolina due to slow growth in power demand. Progress Energy, which Duke acquired last year, proposed building two AP1000 reactors at the Harris nuclear plant site in Wake County, North Carolina, and submitted an application in 2008 for a construction and operating license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Duke officials are expected to discuss the Harris decision Friday when Duke’s first-quarter earnings are reported. Dhiaa Jamil, president of Duke Energy Nuclear, said Duke has sufficient generation to serve customers in North and South Carolina for many years even as the company retires older coal-fired plants. The company’s supply forecast indicates additional nuclear generation won’t be needed at Harris for at least 15 years. “The Harris site is well-suited for new nuclear generation and has not been eliminated from our long-term consideration as a site to expand our nuclear fleet,” Jamil said in a release. The once-predicted revival of U.S. nuclear construction has been tempered by lower natural gas prices, anemic growth in electric demand and the absence of limits on emissions of carbon dioxide. In February, Duke said its Progress Energy Florida utility would retire, rather than repair, the heavily damaged Crystal River reactor in Florida. Duke said it will continue to work to obtain NRC licenses for two new reactors at the Levy site in Levy County, Florida, and another two reactors at the W.S. Lee site in Gaffney, South Carolina. Since Jan. 1, 2011, Duke said it has spent nearly $334 million on the Lee nuclear proposal, according to a filing with state regulators. Four new reactors are currently under construction at two sites in the southeastern United States: two at Scana Corp’s  Summer nuclear station in South Carolina and two at Southern Co’s Vogtle station in Georgia. While a number of companies continue to pursue NRC approval to develop new reactors, none has committed to actually build another new reactor. Last year, the NRC said it would not issue licenses for new reactors until it satisfies a federal court order related to nuclear waste rules, a delay expected to last at least two years. A decision from the NRC on the Levy license application had been expected this year while a timeline for the Lee application was being revised, according to an NRC website.",5022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-duke-nuclear/duke-energy-suspends-effort-to-license-n-carolina-nuclear-units-idUSL2N0DJ2QG20130502
134,DUK,Duke Energy profit below expectations; power demand weak,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N), the largest power provider in the United States, reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, citing weak electricity demand and higher costs at two key units. The company, which uses coal, natural gas and nuclear plants to generate electricity, has had weak power sales since the 2008 recession as the housing market struggles to recover and consumers remain reluctant to increase their spending. Demand from commercial customers was especially weak in the first quarter, Duke said, but it still expects to earn $4.20 to $4.45 per share this year. The midpoint of that forecast roughly matches analysts’ average estimate of $4.33. Low rainfall in Brazil boosted generation costs at a key hydroelectric power station, the company said. Duke operates an international power supply business, primarily in South America, but the United States is its largest market. “We expect the back half of 2013 to be stronger than the same period in 2012,” Chief Financial Officer Lynn Good said in an interview. She said pending rate increase requests and cost savings from the integration of Progress Energy, acquired last summer for $18 billion, will help Duke reach its profit goal for the year. The company is seeking a 9.7 percent rate increase in North Carolina and a 5.1 percent rate increase in Ohio. Both increases are controversial within the states, though Good said she expects to have increases approved later this year. “The combination of all those things represents about $1 billion of revenue,” she said.

135,DUK,UPDATE 2-Duke Energy profit below expectations; power demand weak,"By Ernest Scheyder May 3 (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp, the largest power provider in the United States, reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, citing weak electricity demand and higher costs at two key units. The company, which uses coal, natural gas and nuclear plants to generate electricity, has had weak power sales since the 2008 recession as the housing market struggles to recover and consumers remain reluctant to increase their spending. Demand from commercial customers was especially weak in the first quarter, Duke said, but it still expects to earn $4.20 to $4.45 per share this year. The midpoint of that forecast roughly matches analysts’ average estimate of $4.33. Low rainfall in Brazil boosted generation costs at a key hydroelectric power station, the company said. Duke operates an international power supply business, primarily in South America, but the United States is its largest market. “We expect the back half of 2013 to be stronger than the same period in 2012,” Chief Financial Officer Lynn Good said in an interview. She said pending rate increase requests and cost savings from the integration of Progress Energy, acquired last summer for $18 billion, will help Duke reach its profit goal for the year. The company is seeking a 9.7 percent rate increase in North Carolina and a 5.1 percent rate increase in Ohio. Both increases are controversial within the states, though Good said she expects to have increases approved later this year. “The combination of all those things represents about $1 billion of revenue,” she said. For the quarter, the company posted a profit of $634 million, or 89 cents per share, up from $295 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for the Progress Energy transaction, Duke said it earned $1.02 per share. By that measure, analysts expected $1.04, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

137,DUK,Radioactive tritium found in leak at South Carolina nuclear plant,"CHARLESTON, South Carolina (Reuters) - More than 100 gallons of water containing radioactive tritium has leaked from a discharge pipe at the Catawba Nuclear Station near Lake Wylie, South Carolina, and could reach groundwater, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said on Wednesday. The leak, which was found Tuesday night in a fiberglass discharge pipe from the turbine building sump pump, occurred about a half-mile inside the station’s grounds, said officials at Duke Energy Corp, the plant’s operator. Although the leak has the potential to reach groundwater, samples indicated a small concentration of tritium, officials said. “If you do the calculations on that amount of tritium, it’s less than half of the Environmental Protection Agency’s drinking water standard,” said Roger Hannah, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s regional office in Atlanta. Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. A byproduct of nuclear reactor operations, tritium also occurs naturally in air and water. “This radiological dose of tritium is equal to about one-fifth of a chest X-ray or a cross-country flight,” said Duke spokesman Scott Andresen. “It must be drunk in large quantities to pose any health risk.” Water has stopped flowing through the pipe and the spilled water contained no radioactive isotopes other than tritium, Andresen said. He said it would be some time before officials know exactly how much water was spilled because they must determine the flow, test pump logs and test soil around the underground pipe. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, exposure to tritium increases the risk of developing cancer. But because it emits very low energy radiation and leaves the body relatively quickly, it is one of the least dangerous radionuclides. Duke, the largest electric power holding company in the United States with more than $110 billion in total assets, serves about 7.2 million electric customers in six states in the Southeast and Midwest.

139,DUK,NRC to inspect Duke North Carolina Harris nuclear reactor,"May 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said Wednesday that it was launching a special inspection at Duke Energy Corp’s Harris nuclear power plant in North Carolina over a “quarter-inch flaw” on the plant’s reactor vessel head. Duke shut the 900-megawatt (MW) plant on May 15 when further analysis of ultrasonic data gathered during an earlier refueling outage revealed an irregularity about one-quarter inch long near a nozzle on the vessel head. Duke normally does not comment on the length of outages for competitive reasons but in this case said the repair would take a few weeks, Kim Crawford, a spokeswoman at Duke, told Reuters. The company commented after some mistaken information had been published about the plant, she said. The flaw did not penetrate the vessel head wall and there was no evidence of leakage, the NRC said. Duke said it has already begun the repair process. “There was no immediate threat to the public or plant workers,” Victor McCree, NRC Region II Administrator, said in a release. “Because the discovery is on the vessel head and was not seen in the original review, we are sending specialists from our Atlanta office to further evaluate the issue,” McCree added. The plant is located near New Hill about 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Raleigh, the state’s capital.",5222013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-operations-duke-harris/nrc-to-inspect-duke-north-carolina-harris-nuclear-reactor-idUSL2N0E31KV20130522
140,DUK,UPDATE 3-Duke's Edwardsport coal-fired power plant enters service,"By Scott DiSavino June 10 (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp’s 618-megawatt (MW) Edwardsport coal-fired power plant in Indiana has entered service, the power company said on Monday, one year late and $1.5 billion over budget. Edwardsport is the largest U.S. power plant to use an advanced integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology, which strips out pollutants from coal before it is burned. The IGCC technology was touted as a way for utilities to continue to take advantage of the nation’s abundant coal supplies despite rising concerns about global warming. However, the lack of federal limits on carbon dioxide emissions, high construction costs and new supplies of affordable natural gas have led developers to abandon more than three dozen IGCC projects over the last decade. Only Duke, the biggest U.S. power company, and Southern Co  have constructed IGCC projects. The Edwardsport plant, in Indiana’s southwest corner, entered service on Friday and is expected to slowly ramp up to its full capacity over the next 15 months. “Coal has powered Indiana for more than a century,” Duke Energy Indiana President Doug Esamann said in a press release. “But today’s air quality standards require us to use that fuel in a cleaner, more efficient way. Edwardsport turns coal into a cleaner-burning fuel.” The plant cost about $3.5 billion, including financing, up 75 percent from early estimates of less than $2 billion in 2007,  when Indiana regulators approved the project. Duke blamed the added costs on the project’s “scale and complexity.” As critics complained about the rising cost, Duke’s Indiana utility entered a settlement agreement that cut to about $2.6 billion the amount of money it can recover from its 790,000 Indiana ratepayers. Since President Barack Obama took office in 2009, U.S. power companies have announced plans to shut or convert more than 50,000 MW of coal-fired power plants over the next several years. Weak natural gas prices make it uneconomic to upgrade pollution-control systems on coal-fired plants to comply with strict U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rules. The price tag for Southern Co’s IGCC project, the 582-MW Kemper plant in east-central Mississippi, has also increased during construction. Its cost has risen to more than $4.2 billion,  double its initial estimate. The Kemper County plant is expected to begin operating in May 2014. Edwardsport replaces about 500 MW of older coal-fired generation that Duke retired or expects to retire soon due to the new EPA regulations, Duke said. Esamann said the average age of Duke’s coal-fired plants in Indiana is 45 years. Edwardsport, the first IGCC plant to be built in the United States in more than a decade, was constructed by Bechtel using General Electric gasification technology. Duke said the plant will produce 10 times as much power as the former Edwardsport units, with about 70 percent fewer emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and particulates combined. It will also reduce carbon dioxide emissions per megawatt hour by nearly half compared to the plant it replaces. Duke said the Edwardsport project created about 3,500 construction jobs and 140 full-time jobs. The company also said the 1.7 million to 1.9 million tons of coal the plant will use each year will support about 170 mining jobs.",6102013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-operations-duke-edwardsport/update-3-dukes-edwardsport-coal-fired-power-plant-enters-service-idUSL3N0EM2G720130610

142,DUK,Duke Energy turns to insider to succeed CEO Rogers,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N) has turned to an insider, Chief Financial Officer Lynn Good, to take over as chief executive when Jim Rogers steps down as part of a regulatory settlement linked to its $18 billion takeover of Progress Energy. Good, 54, a veteran of the U.S. utility industry who is well known on Wall Street, was viewed by analysts as a leading contender for the job. Having served as CFO since July 2009, she is considered a strong manager with the experience to lead the large, complex company like Duke, the No.1 U.S. power producer. “She’s highly competent; she knows the ropes so there won’t be a learning curve,” Paul Patterson, an analyst at Glenrock Associates in New York, said on Tuesday after Duke’s announcement. Duke serves about 7.2 million electricity customers in six states in the U.S. Southeast and Midwest. Rogers, 65, had been expected to step down as CEO when Duke’s $18 billion takeover of Progress Energy closed last July, with Progress CEO William Johnson set to take the top job at the combined company. But Johnson was ousted by Duke’s board of directors just hours after the deal closed. Johnson’s removal triggered anger in North Carolina, the merged company’s largest market. Regulators, after reviewing the takeover proposal for months, felt slighted when Rogers unexpectedly took control. Subsequent hearings into the matter resulted in a settlement formalizing Rogers’ exit. Rogers will step down as CEO on July 1. He will continue as Duke chairman until his planned retirement December 31. The board will name one of its independent directors to assume the responsibilities of chairman as of January 1. Unlike Rogers, who exhibited a high-profile among utility executives, Good said she will be “more internally focused,” working to build momentum at the merged company and engaging with regulators and stakeholders in various states in which Duke operates. “North Carolina is our largest jurisdiction and maintaining very positive relationships and working constructively with that commission will always be a priority,” Good said. Andrew Bischof, a utility company analyst at Morningstar in Chicago, said an external candidate would have better been able to repair Duke’s relationship with North Carolina regulators. Even so, Good’s experience leaves her “well positioned to continue on the integration of Progress Energy,” he said. The company still faces a difficult regulatory climate in North Carolina, where it is working to raise customer rates, and in Florida, where it plans to decommission the crippled Crystal River nuclear plant. Good joined Cinergy, a Duke Energy predecessor company, in 2003 after 20 years in senior management roles and as a partner for Deloitte & Touche and Arthur Andersen. Under a new three-year employment contract, Good will earn a base salary of $1.2 million, with additional bonus targets that could increase her compensation to about $8.1 million a year, according to a regulatory filing.

147,DUK,Duke Energy shelves major nuclear project in Florida,"MIAMI (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp said on Thursday it will not proceed with a $24 billion nuclear power project in central Florida because of licensing delays and doubts about cost recovery, but may use the site for nuclear power generation in the future. The announcement was the latest blow to nuclear power investment in the Sunshine State and reflected the boom in natural gas development nationwide. Although it is pulling the plug on plans to build a nuclear plant in Florida’s Levy County, the company said it continues to regard the Gulf Coast site as a “viable option for future nuclear generation.” “We continue to believe that a balanced energy portfolio, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, and state-of-the-art cleaner power plants are critical to securing Florida’s energy future,” Alex Glenn, president of Duke Energy’s utility operations in the state, said in a statement. He cited delays in the licensing of new plants by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as well as uncertainties about cost recovery, as among leading reasons plans to build the plant had been put on hold. “Nuclear energy should remain an option to meet Florida’s future energy needs,” said Glenn. Duke Energy Florida provides electricity to approximately 1.7 million customers in Florida. Duke Energy, the biggest power company in the United States, announced in February that its Progress Energy Florida utility would retire the Crystal River nuclear plant on the state’s west coast. The plant had been offline since late 2009 due to damage done to the reactor’s containment structure during a power upgrade and the replacement of the unit’s steam generators. The Levy project decision was welcomed by critics of nuclear energy in Florida. “Duke’s leadership has taken a fresh look at these unnecessary nuclear projects and has absolutely made the right decision for Florida consumers,” said Stephen A. Smith, executive director of Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. “While important details are still being resolved, Florida consumers should rejoice in knowing that the fleecing associated with this nuclear project will end,” he added, noting that the Levy project cost had “skyrocketed.” Duke said it will continue the process to obtain a license to build the plant, but in the meantime it plans to seek to construct or acquire natural gas-fired power generation. “It is encouraging to see Duke recognize the value of nuclear energy by keeping its options open for this site,” said Jerry Paul, a Florida-based nuclear engineer with the Energy Information Institute. “Most experts would agree that zero-emission nuclear energy must play a role in America’s and Florida’s future energy supply,” he added. Paul said the Levy decision appeared to be based on a narrow set of factors related to Duke’s Florida territory, including electricity demand projections and the timeline for available energy from that plant compared with the delays in the permitting process. There are currently 100 reactors licensed to operate in the United States. The reactors have a total capacity of about 97,843 megawatts (MW) and generate about 20 percent of the nation’s power. In February Duke said it was evaluating the potential to build a new gas plant that could come online as early as 2018. In 2012, before the merger with Duke, Progress said it delayed the proposed in-service date for the Levy county nuclear power plant to 2024 with a second unit following 18 months later. The company also boosted the cost estimate for the 2,200-MW project to between $19 billion and $24 billion.

149,DUK,Duke Energy profit misses Street on weak commercial sales,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N), the largest power provider in the United States, posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday due in part to weak commercial sales.

Wholesale prices dropped this year to $16 per megawatt hour in a PJM auction from $110 per megawatt hour in 2012, due in part to overcapacity, sharply denting Duke’s profit. The low prices are only temporary and should rise next year to $126 per megawatt hour, CEO Lynn Good said in an interview. “You can expect the prices to increase from here to 2015 and then they’ll moderate,” said Good, who was named Duke’s CEO earlier this summer. Despite the disappointing commercial sales, Duke still expects to earn $4.20 to $4.45 per share this year. The midpoint of that forecast roughly matches analysts’ average estimate of $4.33. Good said she believes Duke can hit that goal as rate increase requests are approved in North Carolina and Ohio and the company squeezes more cost savings from the integration of Progress Energy, acquired last summer for $18 billion. “We’re going to hit consensus,” Good said. “We feel like we have built a lot of momentum and have resolved our near-term priorities and are positioning the company for the future.” For the second quarter, the company posted net income of $339 million, or 48 cents per share, compared with $444 million, or 99 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding charges to write off investments in a failed Florida nuclear project, as well as other one-time items, the company earned 87 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 94 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s 2012 buyout of rival Progress Energy substantially increased the company’s float. Operating revenue rose to $5.88 billion from $3.58 billion, missing the $5.73 billion expected by Wall Street. Duke’s shares have gained 11.5 percent so far this year and closed Tuesday at $71.12.

154,DUK,"UPDATE 1-Rainy, cool weather chills Duke Energy's profit","By Ernest Scheyder Nov 6 (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp, the largest U.S. power company, posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, primarily due to wet, cool weather in North and South Carolina that reduced demand for air conditioning. Third-quarter net income was $1 billion, or $1.42 per share, compared with $594 million, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier. The company bought rival Progress Energy last July for $18 billion. Excluding a charge related to that deal and other one-time items, Duke earned $1.46 per share for the third quarter. On that basis, analysts’ average forecast was $1.51, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The third quarter is the biggest quarter for a utility,” Lynn Good, Duke’s chief executive, said in an interview. “It was just unseasonably cool in the Carolinas, with a lot of rain.” Utilities depend on customers cranking up air conditioners and other power-hungry devices during the summer. The cool weather dented Duke’s earnings by 9 cents per share, Good said. Operating revenue fell slightly to $6.71 billion. Analysts expected $7.32 billion. Duke raised the bottom end of its 2013 earnings forecast, citing recent approvals of requests to raise utility rates. The company now expects an adjusted profit per share of $4.25 to $4.45, versus a previous range of $4.20 to $4.45. Analysts expect $4.30 per share. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke has 57,000 megawatts of generating capacity and 7.1 million electricity customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. The company is the second-largest U.S. operator of nuclear power plants. Good said on Wednesday that the company’s nuclear plants “are some of the most important assets that we own.” Shares of Duke closed Wednesday at $72.45, up nearly 14 percent this year.",11062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/dukeenergy-results/update-1-rainy-cool-weather-chills-duke-energys-profit-idUSL2N0IR0P120131106

158,DUK,Duke's proposed S. Carolina Lee reactor passes environmental test,"Dec 27 (Reuters) - U.S. power company Duke Energy Corp’s  proposed Lee nuclear power plant in South Carolina passed an environmental test but still has a long way to go to receive a construction and operating license, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said on Friday. The NRC said its staff concluded there are no environmental impacts to preclude issuing licenses to build and operate two 1,117-megawatt reactors at the proposed Lee station in Cherokee County, South Carolina. Duke applied for the license to build two of Westinghouse Electric’s AP1000 reactors at the Lee site in December 2007. Westinghouse Electric is majority owned by Japanese multinational Toshiba Corp. One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes. The NRC said it developed a so-called final environmental impact statement jointly with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The NRC looks at both the environmental and safety impacts of building a new reactor. The NRC said its staff is still working on the final safety evaluation. In addition, the NRC said its five Commissioners will conduct a separate hearing regarding the application and the staff’s review, when completed. While the Lee review activities continue, the NRC said it will not make any final reactor license decisions until at least late 2014. In August 2012, the NRC said it would not issue new reactor licenses until it reviews the environmental impact of storing spent nuclear fuel at temporary sites, such as nuclear power plants, due in part to a lack of a permanent waste storage facility. That self-imposed moratorium followed a federal court ruling in June 2012. The NRC said it expects to complete its waste confidence rule making in September 2014.

159,DUK,"U.S. cracks open skies to testing, use of aerial drones","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. aviation regulator took a step toward opening the skies to aerial drones on Monday, authorizing six sites where unmanned aircraft can be tested for a variety of uses. The Federal Aviation Administration already has approved limited use of drones in the U.S. for law enforcement, surveillance, atmospheric research and other applications. But Monday’s move will give companies, universities and other entities locations at which to test much broader use, such as crop spraying, catching exotic-animal poachers or delivering packages. “It provides the platform for this research to be carried out on a very large scale across the country,” Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Michael Huerta told reporters. The first test site is expected to be open in six months and the sites will operate at least until February 2017. The FAA said the test sites will be developed by the University of Alaska, the state of Nevada, Griffiss International Airport in New York state, the North Dakota Department of Commerce, Texas A&M; University at Corpus Christi, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, which includes locations in New Jersey. The FAA is required to write initial rules governing commercial operation of drones by 2015. The test sites will operate longer, allowing rules to evolve with further testing, Huerta said. Drones are smaller and less costly alternatives to manned aircraft, and are a growing business for aerospace companies such as Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman Corp, Lockheed Martin Corp and AeroVironment Inc. Beyond military capabilities, they also offer uses to businesses and researchers. Amazon.com Inc recently unveiled plans for drones to deliver small packages to homes. Global spending on unmanned aircraft will almost double to $11.6 billion a year by 2023, according to the latest estimate by aviation and aerospace industry research firm Teal Group. The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), an industry group, estimates the industry could contribute more than $80 billion to the U.S. economy over a decade and create more than 100,000 jobs. But the vehicles also have raised privacy and safety concerns, since they could be used for spying or could interfere with already crowded airspace. The FAA chose the six sites from 25 applications it received from 24 states. “These test sites will give us valuable information about how best to ensure the safe introduction of this advanced technology into our nation’s skies,” Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement. Huerta said the FAA would first address the use of drones in small civil applications and expected to issue a proposed rule in early 2014.

160,DUK,COLUMN-Will last year's stock market laggards be 2014's winners?,"CHICAGO, Jan 13 (Reuters) - If the stock market rally continues, last year’s laggards may be this year’s winners. Many of the sectors that could do well are late bloomers in the five-year bull run. They may not seem like obvious choices, yet are worthwhile if you’re contrarian or slightly defensive. Assuming economic fundamentals and corporate earnings remain solid, it could be a decent year for stocks overall and even better for companies that were neglected in 2013. “I’m optimistic,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist for Mesirow Financial in Chicago, who predicts three-percent GDP growth and the creation of up to three million jobs this year. “I haven’t felt bullish in a long time,” Swonk said at the annual economic outlook luncheon of the Executive Club of Chicago on Jan. 9. A surge in institutional buying came in 2012 among homebuilding stocks. But last year, Wall Street moved on and real estate underperformed every sector in the S&P; 500 except for basic materials, rising just 6 percent for the year through Jan. 10, according to Morningstar. This year could be different if the economy continues to create more jobs and spur long-term demand for all kinds of real estate, from single-family homes to commercial storage units. The most recent Case-Shiller Home Price index report showed U.S. home prices posting their strongest annualized gain in seven years. There’s still much pent-up demand for homes and commercial properties. With mortgage rates expected to remain relatively low, the real estate sector still has some promise. Exchange-traded funds that invest in real estate investment trusts are a worthy consideration, especially if you are looking for extra yield. Consider the iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF, which holds developers and property managers like Simon Property Group Inc, American Tower Corp and Public Storage . The fund was up only 1 percent last year, but yields nearly 4 percent. It charges 0.46 percent for annual expenses. The materials sector was the most unloved group among the Standard & Poor’s industry sectors last year, gaining less than 3 percent for the year through Jan. 10.  A highly-cyclical basket of metals, chemical, mining and paper stocks, this cadre tends to do best during mature economic cycles. But laggards can become leaders if U.S. economic growth - pegged at more than four percent in the 3rd quarter - continues. The Materials Select Sector SPDR owns stocks like Monsanto, Dow Chemical Co and Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold. The SPDR charges 0.18 percent for annual management expenses and outperformed the materials sector as a whole, gaining 26 percent last year. Energy was another lackluster sector last year, returning a modest 10 percent for the year ending Jan. 10, compared to the best-performing technology group, which gained 56 percent. Improving demand for energy globally bodes well for companies that produce oil and natural gas, though. The Vanguard Energy ETF owns leading producers and service companies such as ExxonMobil Corp, Chevron Corp  and Schlumberger NV. The fund charges 0.14 percent for annual expenses and returned 26 percent last year. Companies that produce or distribute power, natural gas and water seldom light up any investor’s radar screen during bull rallies. These high-dividend companies only become alluring when investors retreat from the most popular sector of the moment or there’s widespread uncertainty. Since the bull rally will fizzle at some point, it’s always good to have a fallback. Utilities fit that bill. Although these companies were firmly in the bottom tier last year, they could rebound if the market runs into trouble. Consider an ETF such as the iShares U.S. Utilities, which holds blue chips such as Duke Energy Corp, Dominion Resources and Exelon Corp. The fund returned almost 15 percent last year and yields about 3 percent with a 0.46 percent annual expense ratio. Feeling skittish about picking a lackluster U.S. sector and hoping it rebounds? A wiser choice would be to spread your portfolio among every sector through a broad-based world stock fund such as the iShares MSCI ACWI Index ETF, which holds the biggest stocks from around the world such as Apple , Nestle SA and General Electric Co. The fund rose 22 percent last year and charges 0.34 percent for annual expenses.

161,DUK,SCANA raises stake in new Summer nuclear units; Duke bows out,"HOUSTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - SCANA Corp’s utility unit on Monday agreed to increase its ownership stake in two new nuclear units under construction in South Carolina, purchasing a 5 percent state from its public power partner for $500 million. Directors of South Carolina’s state-owned electric utility, Santee Cooper, voted Monday to sell 5 percent of its stake in the two new 1,100-megawatt reactors under construction at the VC Summer plant, reducing its share to 40 percent. SCANA’s South Carolina Electric and Gas Co will own 60 percent of Summer units 2 and 3, which are among the first advanced-design nuclear reactors to be built in the United States in more than 30 years. The once-predicted revival of U.S. nuclear construction has been tempered by lower natural gas prices, anemic growth in electricity demand and the lack of restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide. The only other new U.S. reactors are being built by Southern Co’s Georgia Power unit, along with partners, at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia. Since 2011, Santee Cooper has negotiated with a number of utilities from Florida to Ohio in an effort to reduce its stake in the Summer nuclear units, saying the recession had slowed the state’s electric growth projections. Santee Cooper’s talks failed to produce an agreement. Only Duke Energy still expressed interest in investing in the new Summer reactors. On Monday, however, Duke said in a brief filing that it was “no longer engaged” in discussions with Santee Cooper regarding the potential acquisition of a 5- to 10-percent ownership interest in the Summer reactors. Last year, Duke dropped a plan to build two new nuclear reactors in North Carolina, citing slow growth in power demand. Santee Cooper officials previously they wanted to reduce the utility’s stake in the new reactors to about 20 percent. “The past few years have shown unprecedented volatility in base load fuel costs and increasing regulatory pressures on fossil-fueled generation,” said Lonnie Carter, Santee Cooper’s chief executive, in a statement. “Today’s action reduces our costs to customers somewhat, while still preserving an ownership level that will position us well for the flexibility we will need going forward,” Carter said. SCANA said the additional 110 megawatts it will gain from the deal will replace a portion of the coal-fired generation it expects to retire over the next five years. The increase in ownership of the new nuclear project “will delay the need to build new gas-fired capacity after 2020,” said Kevin Marsh, SCANA chairman. SCANA said the 5-percent ownership interest will be acquired in three stages, with 1 percent to be acquired in late 2017 or early 2018 when the first new Summer reactor is scheduled to begin commercial operation. An additional 2 percent would be acquired before the first anniversary of commercial operation and the final 2 percent would be acquired before the second anniversary date. The agreement also provides that Santee Cooper will not transfer any of its remaining ownership interest in the two new units until both units are completed, the companies said. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval. Previously, Santee Cooper said it negotiated with the Florida Municipal Power Agency, the Orlando Utilities Commission of Florida, American Municipal Power of Columbus, Ohio, and the South Mississippi Electric Power Association.",1282014,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-nuclear-scana/scana-raises-stake-in-new-summer-nuclear-units-duke-bows-out-idUSL2N0L201E20140128
162,DUK,U.S. spinning mills cut operations as cold strains energy grid,"NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The arctic cold sweeping across the United States has caused rare winter power interruptions for U.S. spinning mills in North and South Carolina, including Frontier Spinning Mills, the second-largest yarn producer in the United States Frontier, located in Sanford, North Carolina, the heart of the country’s textile industry, has had to stop operating following requests from their power supplier, Duke Energy Corp., John Bakane, chief executive officer, told Reuters on Thursday. U.S. cotton traders, ginners, and buyers were already dealing with tight supplies and the late processing of a small crop in the world’s top exporter. “You’ve seen mills have to shut down so power companies can heat houses,” Bakane said. The stoppages have lasted for several hours at most, affecting spinning of about 2,000 bales of cotton, Bakane said. That represents just a sliver of Frontier’s annual demand for some 940,000 480-lb bales, but it also means opportunity cost and other production strains. “Whenever you have to shut down a mill and then restart, you have all kinds of efficiency problems,” he said. Duke Energy, the nation’s largest utility, has twice asked industrial customers in the Carolinas curtail power usage this month as snow and cold gripped the region, a spokeswoman said. Industrial users can opt into contracts with utility providers in which they agree to power interruptions for rebates, said Paige Layne, a spokeswoman for Duke Energy. “When we’re looking at historic lows, this is one of the tools our grid operators have available instead of rolling blackouts or other load-shed programs,” Layne told Reuters. Traditionally, industrial users are asked to crimp demand during heat waves, as most residents use air-conditioning. Duke Energy saw a record energy usage peak on Jan. 7 of 20,246 megawatt-hours, surpassing December 2010’s record of 18,985 megawatt-hours. While the impact on the textile industry has so far been small, hampering but not halting operations, it comes at a significant time for the U.S. textile industry. Companies around the world are setting up shop in the United states, drawn as much by lower-cost and reliable energy as by shifting trade flows and improving technology. “If it were to happen every week, that would be an issue,” said a source at another U.S. mill, who declined to be named as he is not authorized to speak with the press. He said that his milling operation had lost two days of production altogether. The increased demand for electricity is just one example of how this winter’s historic cold has roiled industry. Natural gas prices have spiked 20 percent so far this year as demand has surged. Extreme cold, ice, and snow drifts have congested up rail, port and road travel. “Logistics are a disaster this week,” said Jordan Lea, chairman and co-owner of Eastern Trading in South Carolina.

163,DUK,Utility stops leak of coal ash into North Carolina river,"Feb 8 (Reuters) - Workers on Saturday plugged a broken pipe that leaked up to 82,000 tons of power plant coal ash into a North Carolina river, Duke Energy Corp said. Crews filled part of the stormwater pipe with concrete and capped it, and the rest of the pipe will be filled with concrete as well, said Duke, the biggest U.S. electric power provider. “Plugging the pipe was clearly job one, but we’re continuing our efforts and working closely with all the agencies involved in this response,” Charlie Gates, senior vice president for power generation operations, said in the statement. Duke’s next step is to keep monitoring water quality, he said. The ash release was discovered on Sunday at the power plant in Eden, North Carolina, which was retired in 2012. The company said the pipe under a 27-acre (11-hectare) ash pond released enough coal ash to fill between 20 and 32 Olympic-size swimming pools. An estimated 24 million to 27 million gallons (91 million to 102 million liters) of ash basin water also reached the river, Duke said. Before the pipe was sealed, Duke installed a catch basin and pumps at its end to reduce outflow to the river. Samples by Duke and the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources show that water quality is improving, the company said. Waterkeeper Alliance, a water advocacy group, said this week that analysis of Dan River samples showed “extremely high levels” of arsenic, chromium, iron, lead and other toxic metals typically found in coal ash. A Duke Energy spokesman has said tests by the utility and North Carolina officials indicated no adverse impact on the water supply.

164,DUK,North Carolina asks to halt settlement after Duke coal ash spill,"Feb 11 (Reuters) - North Carolina has asked a state judge to put a controversial settlement deal with U.S. power company Duke Energy over pollution on hold after a massive coal ash spill into a local river raised fresh concerns about water safety. Last week Duke said a pipe broke at one of its retired coal plants, spilling 50,000 to 82,000 tons of ash, enough to fill 20 to 32 Olympic-size swimming pools, into North Carolina’s Dan River. The accident occurred amid a long-running legal battle over the storage of coal ash waste at Duke facilities. The company owns all of North Carolina’s 14 coal-fired power plants, though some are in the process of being decommissioned. North Carolina’s Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) filed lawsuits last year against Duke Energy  alleging water quality violations at the company’s plants. It then proposed a settlement agreement with the company in July that would levy $99,000 in fines and order increased monitoring of possible contamination at the sites. “We were already addressing coal ash ponds through our multiple lawsuits against Duke Energy and we will continue on that course once we have an updated assessment of the situation statewide,” DENR Secretary John Skvarla said in a statement on Tuesday. “This experience may cause us to reevaluate the proposed consent order,” he said. Lawyers for North Carolina sent a letter on Monday to Judge Pat Ridgeway in the Wake County Superior Court, who is handling the suits, to ask for the postponement. Environmental groups say coal ash in the state, a byproduct of power plants containing heavy metals that can cause cancer and nervous system damage, is stored in antiquated or unlined pits and risks seeping into groundwater and nearby rivers. The Southern Environmental Law Center, which intervened in the lawsuits, assailed the proposed settlement for failing to require a cleanup of the coal ash contamination. DENR received almost 5,000 public comments, nearly all of them negative, on the settlement. Some changes were made to the deal after the comment period but green groups said the fines remained small and there was still no requirement for comprehensive cleanup. Duke spokeswoman Lisa Hoffmann said that while the company was eager to complete the work outlined in the proposed settlement agreement, “the event at Dan River is a good reason to take a fresh look at our plans moving forward.” On Saturday, Duke said workers successfully plugged the pipe under the 27-acre (11-hectare) ash pond, which broke on Feb. 2. Working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state officials, Duke is testing a coal ash removal system in a small section of the river where a lot of sediment accumulated after the release, Hoffman said. While Duke says water quality continues to improve in the Dan River, the Waterkeeper Alliance, a water advocacy group, said its analysis had shown “extremely high levels” of arsenic, chromium, iron, lead and other toxic metals. “The reason this happened is that Duke poorly designed these coal ash lagoons, building them on top of a storm water pipe,” said Frank Holleman from the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Next to a river is no place to store this kind of dangerous substance,” he said. “There is a threat every day of another catastrophic spill.” The center is also involved in two federal court cases against the company over the coal ash pollution. Duke has filed motions to dismiss both cases, which are still pending, Holleman said. On Sunday, North Carolina’s DENR admitted it had miscalculated the levels of arsenic in the river, initially reporting that sampling showed the water was safe, when it actually exceeded the standards for human health. “We made an honest mistake while interpreting the results,” said Tom Reeder, the director of water resources at DENR, in a news release. The state agency recommended that people avoid “prolonged direct contact” with the river until further notice. DENR also said it would be creating a special task force of experts to review the state’s coal ash ponds. Concerns about coal ash storage ponds were raised long before the Dan River spill, peaking in 2008 when a dam collapse inundated a small community in Tennessee with toxic coal sludge.",2122014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-environment-duke/north-carolina-asks-to-halt-settlement-after-duke-coal-ash-spill-idUSL2N0LG2BI20140212
165,DUK,U.S. prosecutors open criminal probe of Duke Energy coal ash spill,"WINSTON-SALEM, North Carolina (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors are investigating whether a crime was committed when thousands of tons of coal ash sludge spilled from a Duke Energy power plant in North Carolina in early February into a river that supplies drinking water for nearby towns. Subpoenas were received this week by Duke Energy, which retired the coal-fired power plant in Eden in 2012, and the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources regulator, spokesmen for the two entities said on Thursday. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Raleigh ordered officials with the state agency to appear before a grand jury next month with documents related to the spill that began on February 2, according to a copy of the subpoena provided to Reuters by the department. The spokesman for Duke, which installed a permanent plug at the site to stop releases from the ash basin on February 8, declined to share a copy of the company’s subpoena. He said the utility, the largest electric power provider in the United States, was cooperating with all state and federal investigations. “The ash spill itself was something we thought we’d been very transparent about,” Duke spokesman Tom Williams said. “We intend to fix any damage in the appropriate manner.” The company initially said as many as 82,000 tons of ash, enough to fill up to 32 Olympic-size swimming pools, spilled into the Dan River after a stormwater pipe broke under a 27-acre ash pond at the coal plant. An estimated 24 to 27 million gallons of wastewater also reached the river, according to the utility’s initial estimates. A revised calculation put the release down to 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash, less than 4 percent of the total ash held in the basin, Duke said. The drinking water of two towns in neighboring Virginia, Danville and South Boston, had to be treated to remove toxins, officials said. In a subpoena dated February 10 to North Carolina’s environmental department, prosecutors requested inspection records for the pipe dating back to 2010 and copies of correspondence between the agency and Duke Energy regarding the coal ash and wastewater discharge. “The Department of Environment and Natural Resources will cooperate in this matter,” said Drew Elliot, a spokesman for the agency. The U.S. Attorney’s Office was closed on Thursday due to a winter storm that blanketed the Southeast in snow and ice and officials were not available to comment. The spill came amid a long-running legal battle over the storage of coal ash waste at Duke facilities in the state. The North Carolina environmental regulator sued Duke last year over allegations of water quality violations at the company’s plants. On Monday, the state asked a judge to put a controversial settlement deal on hold.

Duke will keep its regulated utilities in Ohio and Kentucky, and will try to sell its merchant power plants, with a total capacity of about 6,600 megawatts, as a package, a spokesman said. “This earnings profile is not a strategic fit for this Duke Energy and we have begun a process to exit it,” Chief Executive Lynn Good said in a statement. Eleven of the plants Duke is planning to sell are in Ohio, one is in Illinois and another is Pennsylvania. The company will record a pretax impairment charge of $1 billion to $2 billion in the first quarter of 2014 related to the sale.

Regulators in North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida approved the company’s request to raise utility rates from September and October. “Our rate increases are all in effect, so (in) 2014 we will be experiencing a full year of these rate increases...” Chief Executive Lynn Good said in an interview. The rate increases also helped the company report a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit. Duke, which forecast annual earnings growth of between 4 percent and 6 percent through 2016, said it expected adjusted earnings of $4.45-$4.60 per share for the year. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $4.32 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings rose to 97 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended December 31, from 62 cents per share a year earlier. The quarter was also helped by cost savings, including those from Duke’s $18 billion buyout of rival Progress Energy in July 2012, which created the largest U.S. power company. Excluding one-time items, Duke earned $1 in the quarter, above analysts’ estimates of 95 cents. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke has a capacity to generate 57,700 megawatts and supplies to 7.2 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio, according to its website. Duke sales would grow only about 0.5 to 1 percent over the next two years as a slow-growing U.S. economy and improved energy efficiency weigh on power demand, CEO Good said. Sales grew by 0.6 percent in 2013, she said. “We have consistently grown from the economic downturn in 2008-2009 but...following recession in the U.S, the snap back for growth has been less.” Wholesale power prices have been low due to weak industrial demand and use of cheap natural gas to generate electricity. Duke said on Monday that it is looking to sell its Midwest commercial generation business, including stakes in 13 merchant power plants, which sell electricity on the wholesale market. The decision to sell the business comes after Ohio regulators rejected Duke’s request for a $729 million rate increase last week.

173,DUK,Second coal ash dump leak sends toxins into North Carolina river,"Feb 19 (Reuters) - North Carolina on Tuesday ordered Duke Energy Corp to plug a leak of contaminated wastewater from a decommissioned power plant, which authorities in the state said might be leaking into a river that supplies drinking water. The arsenic-laced discharge from a 36-inch stormwater pipe was the second this month from beneath a coal ash dump at the Eden plant. In early February, thousands of tons of sludge spilled into the Dan River after a 48-inch pipe broke under the 27-acre ash pond, Duke said. The company - which is mired in a long-running legal battle with the state over the storage of coal ash waste - said on Tuesday it would use a temporary system to cap the second discharge until it developed a permanent scheme. Pipe water samples indicated elevated levels of arsenic, though the duration and volume of the discharge was not known, the Charlotte, N.C.-based firm said. “Downstream public water supplies remain safe and the river meets all water quality standards,” it said, adding it was continuously sampling and monitoring water in the Dan River. The additional discharge was identified during an investigation by the state, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources said on Tuesday. “This second stormwater pipe ... may also be leaking water contaminated with coal ash pollutants into the Dan River,” said Division of Water Resources director Tom Reeder. The state regulatory agency was to hold a press conference at 12:30 p.m. (1730 GMT) on Wednesday. U.S. prosecutors are investigating whether a crime was committed in the first spill, in which Duke said 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash were released into the river. The coal-fired plant was built in the 1940s and retired in 2012.

174,DUK,North Carolina may order Duke Energy to move coal ash after spill,"RALEIGH, N.C., Feb 25 (Reuters) - State regulators in North Carolina may force Duke Energy Corp to move thousands of tons of coal ash from storage ponds at a power plant to a lined landfill after a massive spill this month contaminated water and wildlife in the Dan River. The state’s Department of Environmental and Natural Resources (DENR) said on Tuesday that it planned to modify a permit that has allowed Duke to discharge certain amounts of wastewater from its retired facility in Eden, North Carolina, into the river. At least 30,000 tons of toxic coal ash were released into the Dan River when a pipe broke under the 27-acre (11-hectare) ash pond in a spill discovered on Feb. 2. State officials found a second leak of arsenic-laced discharge from another pipe during their investigation. Both leaks have been plugged, according to Duke and the state regulator. Two towns in neighboring Virginia, Danville and South Boston, get their drinking water from the river. Tom Reeder, director of the regulator’s Division of Water Resources, said his agency is focusing on how to protect the river now that the spills have been stopped. “Based on our investigation of this spill, one option under consideration right now is to eliminate all coal ash waste discharges coming from this facility and require that Duke Energy move the coal ash waste stored onsite to a lined landfill away from any waterways,” Reeder said in a statement. Duke has 60 days to comment on proposed changes to the permit. “We will respond to the state and work to determine the most appropriate resolution,” Duke spokesman Thomas Williams said. “As we have stated, our company is taking another look at how we manage ash basins.” The landfill solution has been long favored by environmentalists concerned about the risks posed by the ash. “It is a good sign that DENR has, in writing, embraced our solution of moving the coal ash out of these unlined lagoons,” said Frank Holleman, senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “But we need action, not merely words.” Federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to employees of Duke and the state environmental regulator as part of a widening probe into possible felony violations at North Carolina’s 14 coal ash sites. The agency has come under fire for its handling of the state’s coal ash ponds, which it concedes are contaminating groundwater. It filed suit against Duke last year, and then proposed a settlement that environmental groups oppose. That proposed settlement has been on hold since the spill. In a letter dated Feb. 20, DENR notified a judge that it may move forward with the settlement. The agency must decide by March 21 how to proceed. While the action announced by the state on Tuesday would apply only to the Dan River site, a task force within the agency is reviewing discharge permits at the state’s 13 other coal ash sites, all owned by Duke. Drinking water from the river has been deemed safe once it is treated. State officials started testing fish tissue this week to determine if fish from the river is safe to eat. They have advised people not to eat the fish for now and to avoid prolonged contact with the water.",2262014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-northcarolina-spill/north-carolina-may-order-duke-energy-to-move-coal-ash-after-spill-idUSL1N0LV03X20140226

176,DUK,North Carolina cites Duke Energy in coal ash spill,"Feb 28 (Reuters) - State regulators in North Carolina on Friday said Duke Energy Corp violated environmental laws and could face quotidian fines after a massive spill of toxic coal ash this month contaminated water and wildlife in the Dan River. The state’s Department of Environmental and Natural Resources (DENR), which has been criticized by green groups and faces a federal government criminal probe over its handling of the decommissioned Eden plant’s spill, issued two notices of wastewater and stormwater violations. “These are violations of state and federal law, and we are holding the utility accountable,” said DENR Secretary John Skvarla. The total amount of fines had not been determined, though Duke could face civil fines of up to $25,000 per day, the DENR said. At least 30,000 tons of toxic coal ash were released into the Dan River when a pipe broke under the 27-acre (11-hectare) ash pond in a spill discovered on Feb. 2. State officials found a second leak of arsenic-laced discharge from another pipe during their investigation. The coal-fired plant was built in the 1940s and retired in 2012. The ash pond stores the waste the plant produced. The discharge led to coal combustion waste coating the river bottom as far as 70 miles downstream. Both leaks have been plugged, according to Duke and the state regulator. Two towns in neighboring Virginia, Danville and South Boston, get their drinking water from the river. The DENR also said this week it planned to modify permitting that has allowed Duke to discharge certain amounts of wastewater and force the utility to move thousands of tons of coal ash from storage ponds to a lined landfill. Duke, the largest electric power provider in the United States, could not immediately be reached for comment. It has said drinking water is safe and it continues to test Dan River water. “We will do the right thing for the river and surrounding communities,” Paul Newton, president of Duke Energy North Carolina, said in a statement on the utility’s website. “We are accountable.” On Friday, the DENR said its investigation found Duke violated water quality laws, rules, and lacked proper water-discharge permitting in the massive spill and in its management of the coal ash pond and its flows into the Dan River. The DENR also said Duke neither applied for, nor was issued, a so-called National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for discharging stormwater from a steam electric power generating facility into state waters. Environmental groups say the coal ash, a powdery byproduct of power plants containing heavy metals that can cause cancer and nervous system damage, is stored in antiquated or unlined pits and risks seeping into groundwater and nearby rivers. U.S. prosecutors have opened a criminal probe over the spill and have requested inspection records and copies of correspondence between the DENR and Duke Energy.",3012014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-northcarolina-spill/north-carolina-cites-duke-energy-in-coal-ash-spill-idUSL1N0LY05G20140301
177,DUK,Duke Energy cited for violations at six plants after coal ash spill,"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C., March 3 (Reuters) - North Carolina regulators have cited Duke Energy Corp for environmental violations at six power plants in a probe prompted by a massive spill at one facility that dumped up to 39,000 tons of coal ash into a river used for drinking water. The state’s Department of Environment and Natural Resources, which is facing scrutiny from federal prosecutors and watchdog groups for its regulation of the decommissioned Eden plant where the spill occurred, said on Monday that Duke failed to obtain federally required stormwater permits at five plants. The notices of violation followed two others announced on Friday for a sixth plant, the Eden facility, where regulators cited the utility for wastewater and stormwater violations. The state said Duke, the country’s largest electric power provider, could face steep civil fines for neither applying for nor obtaining the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit needed to discharge stormwater from steam electric power generating facilities into state waters. “Our agency is determined to make sure that all of these facilities are in compliance with state and federal law,” said John Skvarla, the state agency’s secretary. “We’re doing everything in our power to prevent environmental disasters like what we’ve seen at the Dan River.” The Charlotte, North Carolina-based company has between 15 and 30 days to reply to state regulators investigating its coal ash ponds. “We will respond to the state,” Duke spokeswoman Paige Sheehan said. State officials said they reviewed the permit status of all 14 of the company’s plants in the state after a spill of toxic coal ash discovered on Feb. 2 threatened water and wildlife in the Dan River. The discharge from the spill, which occurred when a 48-inch (122-cm) stormwater pipe beneath a coal ash pond ruptured, released between 24 million and 27 million gallons (91 million to 102 million liters) of wastewater and as many as 39,000 tons of coal combustion residuals into the river that supplies drinking water to two towns in neighboring Virginia. State officials found a second leak of arsenic-laced discharge from another pipe during their investigation at the coal-fired plant, which was built in the 1940s and retired in 2012. Both leaks were plugged. Officials have said treated water is safe for drinking but advised against eating fish from the river or having prolonged contact with the water. Coal combustion residuals from the spill have been identified as far as 70 miles (113 km) downstream, officials say. U.S. prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into the spill and have requested that inspection records and copies of correspondence between the state environmental agency and Duke Energy be produced for a grand jury later this month. The five other facilities cited for violating environmental standards are located in the counties of Rockingham, Rutherford County, Wayne, Person and New Hanover, the state said.",3032014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-northcarolina-spill/duke-energy-cited-for-violations-at-six-plants-after-coal-ash-spill-idUSL1N0M01FW20140303
178,DUK,Duke ordered to stop groundwater pollution at North Carolina coal plants,"(Reuters) - A North Carolina judge ruled on Thursday that Duke Energy Corp must immediately stop the sources of groundwater pollution at its 14 coal-fired power plants in the state. The issue of pollution from coal ash gained momentum in North Carolina last month, when a spill from a retired Duke power plant dumped at least 30,000 tons of ash in the Dan River. In the ruling, Wake County Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway reversed a decision by the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission. He said the panel failed to apply state law properly when it did not force the utility to clean up its coal ash ponds. The appeal of the commission’s decision was brought in 2012 by a consortium of environmental groups, including the Cape Fear River Watch and the Sierra Club. Duke, the biggest U.S. electric power provider, could appeal the ruling. In a statement, it said, “We’re considering this ruling as we take another look at our management of coal ash basins.” At issue was whether the commission had the authority to force Duke to take immediate action to clean up the coal ash ponds. “The ruling leaves no doubt, Duke Energy is past due on its obligation to eliminate the sources of groundwater contamination, its unlined coal ash pits,” D.J. Gerken, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center who represented the conservation groups in the case, said in a statement. “The state has both the authority and a duty to require action now,” he said. Federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to employees of Duke and the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources as part of a widening probe into possible felony violations at the 14 coal ash sites. The North Carolina court decision came a day after Alpha Natural Resources Inc said it would spend $200 million to settle a dispute with the U.S. government over pollution discharged by coal mines.

179,DUK,Duke Energy says it will move coal ash in response to spill,"RALEIGH, N.C., March 26 (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp said on Wednesday it will move coal ash from  three plants and speed up the closure of an additional basin as the company comes under increased scrutiny after a massive spill in North Carolina contaminated a river used for drinking water. In a letter to the state’s utilities commission and legislators, Chief Executive Officer Lynn Good said Duke, the country’s largest electric-power provider, will move wet coal ash to lined landfills from retired plants on the Dan and Catawba rivers. Ash will also be moved from an active plant in Asheville, and remaining units there will either be closed down or converted to dry-ash storage. Coal ash, a byproduct of coal-based energy production, contains heavy metals that can contaminate drinking water and harm fish. Oversight of Duke’s storage sites has intensified since a spill on Feb. 2 released 39,000 tons of coal ash sludge into the Dan River, a source of drinking water for several Virginia communities. Last week, a federal grand jury convened in Raleigh as part of a probe into the company’s handling of coal ash. Federal prosecutors are also investigating the state environmental regulator, the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), for its handling of Duke’s coal-ash ponds in the state, which it admits are contaminating groundwater. Earlier this month a judge ordered Duke to immediately clean up the coal-ash ponds as part of a separate state lawsuit filed by environmental groups last year. A settlement proposed by DENR and decried by environmentalists as too lenient was dropped by the state last week. Governor Pat McCrory, a former Duke executive, has implored the company to do more to clean up the ponds. Good said in the letter that the moves are part of a “disciplined, fact-based approach to evaluating long-term solutions” to coal-ash storage. She said all of Duke’s coal-ash sites are being reviewed both by an internal task force and outside experts who will report back by the end of May. The company will have plans in place to secure ash basins at the rest of its seven retired plants by the end of the year, Good said. “It is good to see the utility becoming publicly responsive to the situation,” DENR spokesman Jamie Kritzer said in a written statement responding to Wednesday’s announcement. Attorney Frank Holleman of the Southern Environmental Law Center was more skeptical. “Duke has yet to make it clear what it is going to do for the other 11 communities (in North Carolina) that are still faced with the possibility of a catastrophe,” he said.

180,DUK,Pension funds target Duke Energy directors over ash spill,"April 15 (Reuters) - The California Public Employees’ Retirement System and New York City Pension Funds have written to shareholders of Duke Energy Corp, urging them to vote against the re-election of four directors. The funds blamed Duke Energy directors Alex Bernhardt, James Hyler, James Rhodes and Carlos Saladrigas for the 39,000 ton coal ash spill in North Carolina’s Dan river in February, after a stormwater pipe broke under a 27-acre ash pond at the company’s coal plant. The directors ""failed to fulfill their obligations of risk oversight as members of a committee overseeing health, safety, and environmental compliance at the company,"" the funds wrote in a joint letter to shareholders on Monday. (r.reuters.com/vam58v) Duke Energy was not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours. The company, United States’ largest electric-power provider,  said last month that it will move coal ash from three plants and speed up the closure of an additional basin as the company came under increased scrutiny after a massive spill in North Carolina contaminated a river used for drinking water. The directors will be seeking re-election at the company’s annual meeting on May 1.

181,DUK,Exelon to become top U.S. power distributor with Pepco buy,"(Reuters) - Exelon Corp said it would buy Pepco Holdings Inc for $6.83 billion, helping it overtake Duke Energy Corp as the biggest power distribution company in the United States. The deal will allow Exelon to sell more power at stable rates set by regulators at a time when an abundance of cheap natural gas is dragging down power prices in the open market. Exelon’s move to reduce its exposure to the vagaries of the wholesale power market comes as U.S. utilities struggle with falling electricity demand in both the open and regulated markets due to increased energy efficiency and a weak economy. However, Exelon’s stock fell as much as 5 percent to $34.22. “Some investors might question Exelon’s desire to increase the company’s regulated exposure at a time when power markets appear to be recovering,” said Wells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton. The company defended the acquisition saying it was maintaining substantial exposure to the recovery in prices. “The acquisition also supports our belief in the value of an integrated utility, with a balanced mix of regulated and non-regulated cash flows,” Exelon Chief Executive Chris Crane, who will lead the combined company, said on a conference call. Exelon said its earnings from the regulated business is expected to rise to as much as 65 percent after the deal, from about 60 percent now. Pepco’s shares rose as much as 18 percent before closing 17.4 percent higher at $26.76, slightly below Exelon’s offer price of $27.25 per share, despite fears of severe regulatory scrutiny for the deal. However, two experts said the deal was unlikely to run into serious trouble from regulators, who most likely will include the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and public utility commissions in New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. There is no antitrust issue since the two companies don’t have customers in the same areas, said Bruce McDonald, an antitrust expert with Jones Day law firm. Pepco operates utilities in the District of Columbia, Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey, serving about 2 million customers. Exelon’s utilities deliver electricity and natural gas to more than 6.6 million customers in Maryland, Illinois and Pennsylvania. The acquisition would not deter Exelon from buying more renewable and conventional power assets, Crane said. At the same time, the company is looking to raise up to $1 billion by selling non-core assets, he said. Weak power prices and consumption have spurred consolidation among utilities in the past three years, with Exelon itself having bought Constellation Energy for $7.9 billion in 2011. Duke Energy and AES Corp have also made acquisitions. Exelon said it expected Pepco to “significantly” add to adjusted earnings in the first full year after the deal closed. The company also reported a lower-than-expected profit for the first quarter, hurt by weak energy prices and a fall in nuclear and coal output.

184,DUK,"UPDATE 2-Duke Energy profit beats as power demand, rates rise","* Adjusted profit $1.17/share vs est. $1.12 * Operating revenue rises 12 pct to $6.62 bln * Operating revenue from regulated utilities rises 14 pct   (Adds comments from CEO, CFO, analyst; updates shares) By Swetha Gopinath May 7 (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp, the largest U.S. power company by market value, reported a better-than-expected adjusted profit for the second straight quarter as a particularly harsh winter boosted power demand. The company, which derives more than 80 percent of its revenue from utilities whose rates are regulated by states, also benefited after North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida approved its request to raise rates last year. Duke, which sells power to 7.2 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky,     said operating revenue from regulated electric utilities rose 14 percent to $5.58 billion in the first quarter ended March 31. “In our service territories we are starting to see, hopefully on a continued basis, a rebound in electricity consumption by our residential and commercial customers,” Chief Financial Officer Steven Young told Reuters. Duke, which struggled with tepid power sales after the recession of 2008 as customers cut spending, said this was the third consecutive quarter of economic growth in their markets. Duke spent $15 million in the first quarter to clean up a massive spill of toxic coal ash into the Dan River in North Carolina. Chief Executive Lynn Good said additional costs would not be material. The company said last month moving its coal-ash dumps away from rivers and lakes in North Carolina may cost it $2 billion to $10 billion. Duke said it took a $1.4 billion charge in the first quarter to write down the value of the Midwest commercial generation business, which it plans to sell to shield itself from volatile prices for power sold on the wholesale market. UBS analysts said the 13 plants on sale had a fair value of $2.2 billion. Duke is selling 11 plants in Ohio and one each in Illinois and Pennsylvania. “It is apparent that the power renaissance and seemingly more M&A; demand has been a factor in lifting the valuation, although ash liabilities appear to be traveling with the portfolio,” the analysts wrote in a note. Young said Duke was talking to potential buyers and plans to close the sale by the fourth quarter or the first quarter. Excluding the writedown of the plants, first-quarter profit was $1.17 per share, above the average analyst estimate of $1.12, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Duke’s customer base is second only to that of Exelon Corp , which said last month it would buy Pepco Holdings Inc  for $6.83 billion, bumping up its number of customers to 10 million. Duke’s operating revenue rose 12 percent to $6.62 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $6.44 billion. Duke’s shares have risen 6 percent this year to Tuesday’s close, valuing the company at $51.66 billion. They were up 1 percent at $73.61 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

186,DUK,Duke Energy to clean up coal ash spilled in Dan river -U.S. EPA,"May 22 (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp has agreed to find and remove coal ash that a retired North Carolina power plant spilled into the Dan River, which provides drinking water to two towns in nearby Virginia, U.S. environmental regulators said on Thursday. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will oversee the cleanup, and Duke will reimburse EPA for current and future costs, a statement issued by the EPA said. On Feb. 2, a 48-inch (122-cm) stormwater pipe beneath a coal ash pond ruptured at the retired Eden coal plant and released between 24 million and 27 million gallons (91 million to 102 million liters) of wastewater and as many as 39,000 tons of coal combustion residue into the Dan river that supplies drinking water to two towns in Virginia. Coal ash, a byproduct of coal-based power production, contains heavy metals that can contaminate drinking water and harm marine life. The assessment and cleanup work in North Carolina and Virginia will be subject to approval by EPA and state environmental agencies, the statement said. “In addition, the Order also requires Duke to reimburse all past EPA response costs, as well as all future oversight costs in connection with the site.” The terms of the Order require that the disposal of coal ash from the spill meet protective disposal standards for landfills, such as synthetic liners, leachate collection systems and groundwater monitoring. Duke Energy, the country’s largest electric power provider, retired the Eden coal plant in 2012. No coal ash has been produced at the site since then.

187,DUK,North Carolina lawmakers order coal ash pond cleanup after Duke spill,"RALEIGH N.C. (Reuters) - North Carolina’s state Senate on Wednesday unanimously approved a bill calling for the closure of Duke Energy’s 33 coal ash ponds in the state within 15 years, legislation spurred by a massive spill at a retired power plant earlier this year. Members of the chamber touted the measure as the nation’s toughest law regulating coal ash, a byproduct of coal-based power production that contains toxic materials such as arsenic and lead. “This is a change that’s going to have North Carolina leading the country when it comes to getting rid of coal ash,” said Republican state Senator Tom Apodaca, who sponsored the bill. Environmentalists raised doubts, however, that the provisions are strong enough to put a dent in the nation’s coal ash problem.  The clean-up plan uses a tiered approach to dictate when ponds at 14 sites statewide must be closed. At the most dangerous sites, including four named in the bill, coal ash would have to be moved to lined landfills or reused as building material by 2019. At sites deemed less dangerous, the cleanup requirements are less stringent and less urgent. Critics of the bill took issue with a provision that would allow the ash to be capped and left in place at sites deemed low risk. “It is really leaving the polluting coal ash in unlined pits next to waterways,” said Frank Holleman, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.  California-based nonprofit Earthjustice, which tracks coal ash sites and is pushing for federal oversight, says more than 200 of the nation’s 1,400 coal ash sites have contaminated nearby waterways.  At least 30,000 tons of coal ash were released into the Dan River when a pipe broke under the 27-acre (11-hectare) ash pond at a retired plant owned by Duke Energy in Eden, North Carolina, in a spill discovered on Feb. 2.  The Senate bill mandates water quality monitoring around all the state’s coal ash pond sites and exploration of methods to reuse coal ash. The measure did not require Duke to pay for clean-up costs rather than passing them on to customers. A Duke Energy spokesman called the timeline set by the Senate “incredibly aggressive,” cutting in half the years the company has proposed for clean-up.  Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican and former Duke executive, has voiced support for a House bill similar to the version passed by the Senate. The two chambers must agree on a final version before seeking McCrory’s signature.

The spill occurred at 11:15 p.m. on Monday during a “routine transfer of fuel oil” at the W.C. Beckjord plant in New Richmond and was stopped 15 minutes later, Duke said.  Intakes for drinking water along the river were closed overnight and drinking water has not been affected, said a spokeswoman for the Greater Cincinnati Water Works, though tests continue. The impact on wildlife was so far unclear. “We notified state and local authorities of the incident and have been working with them throughout the overnight hours,” said Chuck Whitlock, Duke Energy president of Midwest Commercial Generation. “We have cleanup crews on site that are identifying the appropriate actions that will be needed to remediate.” The Coast Guard said the river was closed from mile markers 453 to 468, from Cincinnati to Dayton, Kentucky, while it responded to the spill. Three vessels were on the scene on Tuesday deploying oil containment booms and clean-up materials. The Coast Guard’s initial estimate was that 8,000 gallons were spilled. The W.C. Beckjord Station is being retired as a result of new government emissions standards. Four of the plant’s six coal-fired units have been closed and the remaining two are expected to shut down by the end of the year.

197,DUK,Power producer Duke Energy to retire coal-fired plants in Ohio,"Aug 28 (Reuters) - Power company Duke Energy Corp  outlined plans to retire the remaining coal-fired stations at its Ohio plant by the end of the month as it looks to cope with tightening power plant emission regulations. Power utilities are cutting their exposure to coal-fired plants to comply with air emission regulations, the latest being the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s plans to lower carbon emissions from existing plants to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Duke Energy will stop coal-fired power generation at its WC Beckjord Station in New Richmond, Ohio, by retiring units 5 and 6, effective Sept. 1, the company said on Thursday. Four oil-fired combustion turbines on the site will continue operations, while employees at the coal station would be moved to its nearby plants, Duke said. Duke Energy Ohio had said in 2011 it would retire Beckjord Station’s coal-fired units 1 through 6, totaling 862 megawatts of generating capacity, by January 2015. NRG Energy Inc said on Thursday it will spend about $567 million to reduce emissions from four coal-fired power plants in Illinois.

198,DUK,Duke Energy to invest $500 million in North Carolina solar power,"RALEIGH N.C. (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp, the largest provider of electric power in the United States, will invest $500 million in a major expansion of its solar power program in North Carolina, the Charlotte-based company said Monday.  The company plans to acquire and finish building three solar power farms under development in rural areas in the eastern part of the state that will produce a total of 128 megawatts of capacity of electric power.  One of them, the Warsaw Solar Facility developed by Solar Strata, will be the largest solar power generation site east of the Mississippi River, the company said. Duke has also agreed to buy power from five solar projects for a total of 150 megawatts of capacity.  The move will help the company meet state requirements that energy companies generate 12.5 percent of their power through renewable sources by 2020.  The use of solar power has been increasing nationally in recent years, with more than half of all new capacity coming from solar projects in the first half of 2014, according to a report released this month by the Solar Energy Industries Association.  The 278 megawatts that Duke Energy will add represents a small fraction of the nearly 50,000 megawatts of capacity produced nationally by company.  But Duke Energy officials said the moves amount to the company’s largest single jump in solar energy production, and will result in a 60 percent increase in the amount of solar power used by its North Carolina customers.  “We are bringing large amounts of renewable energy onto our system in the most cost-effective way possible,” Rob Caldwell, a senior vice president, said in a statement.

202,DUK,Duke Energy results miss estimates as power demand chills,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N), the largest U.S. power company by market value, reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit as a cool summer reduced demand. The company, which also operates in Brazil, Argentina and Chile, said the results were also hurt by lower income from international operations and higher fuel costs.  Duke said it was the second cool summer in a row. “Although the weather this summer was milder than usual, we remain on track to meet our financial objectives for 2014 and beyond,” said Chief Executive Lynn Good said in a statement. The company sells power to 7.2 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Expenses for fuel used in power generation and purchase in the regulated sector rose 6 percent while it shot up 14 percent in the non-regulated business in the third quarter, the company said.  Duke is increasing its reliance on natural gas as it retires some coal plants to comply with U.S. environmental regulations. Natural gas is expected to account for a third of the company’s fuel mix next year, CEO Good told Reuters.  Use of natural gas to generate power has expanded to about 20 percent in 2014 from less than a “few percent” in 2008, Good said. Duke, which also runs nuclear power plants, said in September that it would own a 40 percent stake in a new $5-billion natural gas pipeline that will run through West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina.  The company is reducing exposure to the volatility of wholesale power markets and is selling more power at rates set by regulators. It sold some Midwest power assets - a big chunk of its wholesale assets - to Dynegy Inc DYN.N in August for $2.8 billion.  Net income attributable to Duke rose 27 percent to $1.3 billion, or $1.80 per share in the quarter ended September, helped by the reversal of a $477 million impairment charge related to the sale of its Midwest business. Excluding the charge, Duke earned $1.40 per share, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.52 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Duke also recognized a liability of about $3.4 billion in asset retirement obligations in the quarter to comply with the North Carolina’s Coal Ash Management Act of 2014. The state’s Senate has asked Duke to close down 33 coal ash ponds within 15 years after coal ash was released into the Dan River from a retired plant in February. Duke shares were up 1.4 percent at $83.42 on the New York Stock Exchange, in line with a broader rally in energy stocks after Republicans gained control of the U.S. Senate.

205,DUK,"UPDATE 1-Calif. governor vows to boost renewable energy, cut petroleum use","(Adds details, background) SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 5 (Reuters) - California Governor Jerry Brown on Monday laid out an ambitious plan for 50 percent of the state’s electricity to be generated by renewable resources over the next 15 years and to cut petroleum usage by drivers. Brown, who was sworn in for an unprecedented fourth term, said he would also seek to double the energy efficiency of existing buildings and make heating fuels cleaner. “I envision a wide range of initiatives: more distributed power, expanded rooftop solar, micro-grids, an energy imbalance market, battery storage, the full integration of information technology and electrical distribution and millions of electric and low-carbon vehicles,” Brown said in his speech in Sacramento. The state has pushed to implement far-reaching climate change policies, including its landmark AB 32 law aimed at reducing carbon pollution back to 1990 levels by 2020. Brown said California was on track to meet its goal of generating one-third of the state’s electricity through renewable energy within the next five years. The governor’s new initiative could be a boon for green energy companies, such as manufacturers of electric vehicles and those looking to build utility-scale solar projects or upgrade the state’s aging electric grid. SolarCity Corp, the largest U.S. residential solar panel installer, and Vivint Solar Inc are already big players in California. NRG Energy Inc, a top competitor on the East Coast, announced in November that it aimed to open new offices in California. A trio of companies including Duke Energy Corp in September proposed an $8 billion green energy initiative for Los Angeles. Since 2013 California’s cap-and-trade program has raised nearly $1 billion from companies to offset their carbon emissions. The money could increase significantly as the program expands this year to cover distributors of transportation fuel like gasoline and diesel and home heating fuels like natural gas.

206,DUK,"Apple deal, tax change could spark corporate solar stampede","Feb 11 (Reuters) - Apple Inc’s deal to buy nearly $1 billion of power from a massive First Solar Inc  plant could be the first of a stampede of contracts driven by the looming change in a solar tax incentive that makes such projects particularly attractive. Together with a sharp drop in the cost of solar power and corporate efforts to rack up green credentials, the expiring tax subsidies have large energy purchasers taking a hard look at buying solar under big long-term contracts. Apple on Tuesday said it would spend $848 million over 25 years to buy 130 megawatts of electricity from a 280 MW plant - the solar industry’s largest-ever corporate power purchase agreement, or PPA. Apple’s major financial commitment gives solar a level of mainstream credibility that should entice other new customers. “This is a market-making type of transaction,” said Tom Werner, chief executive of SunPower Corp, a U.S. solar company that is majority owned by France’s Total SA. SunPower is already seeing a rush to get projects done before a critical federal tax credit for solar projects drops to 10 percent from 30 percent in 2017, Werner added. SunPower, First Solar, SunEdison Inc, Recurrent Energy LLC, which is being acquired by solar panel maker Canadian Solar Inc, and 8minutenergy Renewables LLC are among the developers of the massive solar installations that have cropped up to serve the utility industry. Their size can rival that of a coal- or natural gas-fired plant. The Apple-First Solar deal could serve as a template for other big companies like Google Inc and Facebook Inc  to use large-scale solar plants to bypass utilities when they need to power their operations. “Given the profile of Apple and their reputation we think it’s going to stimulate a lot of other companies that may not have programs as active as Apple’s to ask questions - is there a smarter better way we can procure our energy?,” First Solar CEO Jim Hughes said in an interview. To be competitive in the market, large-scale solar projects need to be able to sell power for about 5 cents per kwh, a cost level that is starting to become feasible for the technology, although just barely, according to Shayle Kann, senior vice president of research at market research firm GTM Research. With large solar projects, customers can save between 15 and 20 percent off their energy bills over the course of a contract, according to Ed Lieberman, vice president of customer development at CustomerFirst Renewables, a Washington-based firm that advises large organizations on renewable power procurement. The deadline to claim the full 30 percent federal tax credit should drive a boom in activity over the next two years, Lieberman added. About 14 gigawatts of utility-scale projects are scheduled to come online in 2015 and 2016, compared with just 1 GW in 2017, according to Shayle Kann, senior vice president of research at market research firm GTM Research. Corporations and other non-utility customers will buy more than 100 MW of the power from those projects this year and potentially more than double that next year, Kann said. Even before Apple’s announcement on Tuesday, the market was growing. Apple already had plans to power a new Arizona data center with solar power. And last year Duke Energy Corp  reached a 20-year deal to sell power from a 52 MW project in North Carolina to The George Washington University, American University and George Washington University Hospital. Also last year, the University of California signed 25-year agreements to buy 80 MW of power from two Frontier Renewables LLC projects in Fresno County.

Lee Steam, Cape Fear and Asheville electricity-generating plants, according to a company statement on Friday. Apart from the monetary fines, Duke Energy will enter a five-year probation period, during which the company agreed to establish environmental compliance plans under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor, the cost of which shall be borne by the company. Additionally, Duke Energy will have to maintain $500 million as security to meet their obligations under the plea agreements, the statement added. A pipe break at a retired Duke coal plant triggered the third-worst coal ash spill in U.S. history, prompting North Carolina’s state Senate to ask Duke to close 33 coal ash ponds in the state within 15 years.

219,DUK,Duke Energy profit helped by unusually cold weather,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N), the largest U.S. power company by generation capacity, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as exceptionally cold winter weather boosted electricity demand. Duke, which sells power to 7.3 million customers in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, said adjusted income in its regulated power business rose 5 percent to $774 million. “Our customers needed a record amount of electricity during the exceptionally cold weather in February,” Chief Executive Lynn Good said in a statement on Friday. Net income attributable to Duke was $864 million, or $1.22 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $97 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. The year earlier quarter included an impairment charge of about $1.4 billion related to the company’s non-regulated Midwest generation business, which was later sold to Dynegy Inc DYN.N. The company has been cutting exposure to the volatility of wholesale power markets and focusing on regulated markets, where power prices are stable. For the latest quarter, adjusted profit was $1.24 per share, topping the average analyst estimate of $1.14 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Duke, which also operates in Brazil, Argentina and Chile, said adjusted income from its international business fell 72 percent, mainly due to a multi-year drought in Brazil that hurt hydro-electric generation. The company has been converting some of its coal-powered plants into cheaper and less polluting plants that run on natural gas. “Low natural gas prices are a very significant benefit for our customers and they’ve enjoyed these prices as we’ve continued to add natural gas for our system,” Good told Reuters. Duke shares closed at $77.57 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising 4 percent in the past 12 months.

223,DUK,Duke Energy pleads guilty to environmental crimes in North Carolina,"RALEIGH, N.C. (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp pleaded guilty on Thursday to environmental crimes over a North Carolina power plant’s coal ash spill into a river and management of coal ash basins in the state, U.S. prosecutors said. The plea entered in federal court in Greenville, North Carolina, by the country’s largest utility owner was expected under a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice announced in February. As part of the deal, Duke agreed to pay $102 million in fines and environmental projects, and to reserve more than $3 billion to comply with environmental standards. “Duke Energy’s crimes reflect a breach of the public trust and a lack of stewardship for the natural resources belonging to all of the citizens of North Carolina,” U.S. Attorney Thomas Walker said in a statement. The company admitted to failures at five of its power plants over several decades that allowed coal ash to enter waterways, including documented problems with the 48-inch pipe that would eventually cause the spill into the Dan River in February 2014. The stormwater pipe beneath a coal ash pond at Duke’s retired power plant in Eden ruptured, releasing up to 27 million gallons of wastewater and as many as 39,000 tons of coal combustion residue into the river that supplies drinking water to two towns in neighboring Virginia. Duke “failed to take reasonable steps to minimize or prevent discharge of coal ash to the Dan River that would adversely affect the environment,” according to a joint statement filed by the company and prosecutors in federal court. Duke and its subsidiaries pleaded guilty to nine misdemeanor violations of the Clean Water Act.  In a statement on Tuesday, the company pledged to “operate our system as safely as possible.” Duke has separately agreed to close and clean up coal ash sites at 14 coal plants in North Carolina, though their methods have been disputed.  Duke’s environmental critics lauded the settlement, one of the largest levied for clean water violations, but noted other lawsuits continue. “This confirms that Duke has committed serious and long-standing environmental crimes,” said John Suttles, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “But it does not clean up the coal ash that is every day continuing to contaminate our drinking water.”  ",5142015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-duke-energy-spill/duke-energy-pleads-guilty-to-environmental-crimes-in-north-carolina-idUSKBN0NZ25920150514

Duke offered $60 in cash for each Piedmont share, representing a premium of about 42 percent premium to the stock’s Friday close. A glut of supply from shale fields has ensured relatively stable pricing for natural gas distributors such as Piedmont. This has prompted a number of U.S. power producers to boost their natural gas infrastructure and lower dependence on power generation as demand for electricity weakens due to increased energy efficiency. Southern Co (SO.N) said in August it would buy AGL Resources Inc GAS.N for about $8 billion in cash. Duke and Piedmont are also among the partners in the $5 billion 550-mile (885-km) Atlantic Coast pipeline, which moves gas from Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale field to North Carolina and Virginia. AGL resources also has a 5 percent stake in the pipeline. Duke sells power to 7.3 million customers in North and South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky at rates set by state regulators. It also provides regulated natgas services to about 500,000 customers in Ohio and Kentucky. Piedmont has about 1 million customers in North and South Carolina and Tennessee. Duke will also assume about $1.8 billion of Piedmont’s net debt, giving the deal an enterprise value of $6.7 billion. Duke said it will raise about $500-$750 million through newly issued equity to help finance the deal. One Piedmont director will join Duke’s board after the deal closes, expected by the end of 2016, and a Piedmont executive will lead Duke’s natural gas operations, the company said. Barclays is Duke’s adviser and Sidley Austin LLP is legal counsel. Goldman Sachs & Co Piedmont and Kirkland & Ellis LLP is legal counsel. Piedmont’s shares were trading up 8.5 percent at $45.81 in light volumes premarket on Monday.

Duke offered $60 in cash for each Piedmont share, representing a premium of about 42 percent premium to the stock’s Friday close. A glut of supply from shale fields has ensured relatively stable pricing for natural gas distributors such as Piedmont. This has prompted a number of U.S. power producers to boost their natural gas infrastructure and lower dependence on power generation as demand for electricity weakens due to increased energy efficiency. Southern Co said in August it would buy AGL Resources Inc for about $8 billion in cash. Duke and Piedmont are also among the partners in the $5 billion 550-mile (885-km) Atlantic Coast pipeline, which moves gas from Pennsylvania’s Marcellus shale field to North Carolina and Virginia. AGL resources also has a 5 percent stake in the pipeline. Duke sells power to 7.3 million customers in North and South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky at rates set by state regulators. It also provides regulated natgas services to about 500,000 customers in Ohio and Kentucky. Piedmont has about 1 million customers in North and South Carolina and Tennessee. Duke will also assume about $1.8 billion of Piedmont’s net debt, giving the deal an enterprise value of $6.7 billion. Duke said it will raise about $500-$750 million through newly issued equity to help finance the deal. One Piedmont director will join Duke’s board after the deal closes, expected by the end of 2016, and a Piedmont executive will lead Duke’s natural gas operations, the company said. Barclays is Duke’s adviser and Sidley Austin LLP is legal counsel. Goldman Sachs & Co Piedmont and Kirkland & Ellis LLP is legal counsel. Piedmont’s shares were trading up 8.5 percent at $45.81 in light volumes premarket on Monday. Up to Friday’s close, Piedmont shares had risen nearly 16 percent in the past 12 months, while Duke’s had fallen nearly 8 percent.

The international business, which spans Brazil, Argentina and Chile, had earned only half of what the company had expected through September, Duke said on Thursday. Adjusted income from international business, which accounts for about 12 percent of revenue, fell nearly 14 percent to $69 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30. In a bid to cut exposure to unregulated markets at home and overseas, Duke said last month it would buy natural gas distributor Piedmont Natural Gas Co for $4.9 billion. Gas distribution companies offer higher growth rates than electric utilities and are low-risk because they are immune to commodity prices, Chief Executive Lynn Good told Reuters. “We constantly are in the market looking at asset availability,” Good said. Duke, which sells power to 7.3 million customers across six U.S. states, has also been retiring several of its coal operations and converting some of them into cheaper and less polluting natural gas-powered plants. The company cut the top end of its adjusted earnings by 10 cents to $4.65 per share, while leaving the lower end unchanged at $4.55. On an adjusted basis, Duke earned $1.47 per share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, lagging the average analyst estimate of $1.51, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s profit from continuing operations rose 5.5 percent to $940 million, or $1.36 per share, in the third quarter, driven by warmer-than-expected weather and lower fuel costs. Total operating revenue rose 1.4 percent to $6.48 billion, but missed the average analyst estimate of $6.87 billion. Duke’s shares were down 0.82 percent at $71.34 in early trading. Up to Wednesday’s close, the stock had lost about 13 percent over the past 12 months.

The company has been cutting exposure to the volatility of wholesale power markets and focusing on regulated markets, where power prices are stable.

266,DUK,Duke Energy shareholder lawsuit over CEO firing moves forward,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp’s board must face a shareholder lawsuit over its abrupt 2012 firing of its newly installed chief executive, a Delaware judge has ruled. In a decision on Wednesday, Delaware Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock denied Duke’s bid to end the case, finding the shareholder plaintiffs plausibly argued that the defendants might have concealed information about their actions from the public and regulators. As part of its $18 billion deal to acquire Progress Energy,  Duke had agreed to install Progress head William Johnson as CEO of the combined company. But within hours of the acquisition’s closing in July 2012, the new Duke board met and fired Johnson, reinstating former Duke CEO James Rogers, in a vote along company lines. Johnson left with a pre-negotiated $44 million severance package. Shareholders almost immediately sued Duke, arguing the decision to terminate him was reached in May 2012 and concealed from the public, investors and regulators. Duke’s share price subsequently fell and the S&P; lowered the company’s credit rating. Duke and the executives and directors named in the lawsuit strongly deny the lawsuit’s allegations and any wrongdoing related to the CEO change after the 2012 merger, Duke said in a statement on Thursday. Duke said the company, executives and directors would continue to vigorously defend themselves in the litigation. In his decision, Glasscock said the plaintiffs plausibly alleged the holdover Duke board members had second thoughts about Johnson in the 18 months between the deal’s announcement and its closing. According to the lawsuit, the board decided to conceal its plan to oust Johnson because it did not want to risk trying to renegotiate the merger terms or face further questions from state regulators that could delay its approval. They chose instead to wait until a meeting after the acquisition closed to say Johnson was not a good fit to lead the combined company, the lawsuit alleged. The abrupt CEO change brought other federal and state claims in North Carolina and an investigation by the state utilities regulator in North Carolina, where Duke and Progress were headquartered. A settlement with regulators formalized Rogers’ exit in 2013. Duke in 2015 settled a securities class action related to the merger in North Carolina federal court for $146 million. Duke and the named executives and directors denied the class allegations of misrepresentations related to the CEO change.

In his decision, Glasscock said the plaintiffs plausibly alleged the holdover Duke board members had second thoughts about Johnson in the 18 months between the deal’s announcement and its closing. According to the lawsuit, the board decided to conceal its plan to oust Johnson because it did not want to risk trying to renegotiate the merger terms or face further questions from state regulators that could delay its approval. They chose instead to wait until a meeting after the acquisition closed to say Johnson was not a good fit to lead the combined company, the lawsuit alleged. The abrupt CEO change brought other federal and state claims in North Carolina and an investigation by the state utilities regulator in North Carolina, where Duke and Progress were headquartered. A settlement with regulators formalized Rogers’ exit in 2013. Duke in 2015 settled a securities class action related to the merger in North Carolina federal court for $146 million. Duke and the named executives and directors denied the class allegations of misrepresentations related to the CEO change.

268,DUK,Norway's fund barred from investing in U.S. firm Duke Energy,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s $900-billion wealth fund can no longer invest in Duke Energy, the biggest U.S. power firm by generation capacity, due to alleged breaches of environmental law at its coal-fired plants, Norway’s central bank said on Wednesday.  The fund, which owns 1.3 percent of the world’s listed company equity with stakes in some 9,050 firms, is barred from investing in companies that make nuclear weapons, anti-personnel landmines or tobacco, among other ethical criteria. Duke Energy and its subsidiaries Duke Energy Carolinas[DUKDP.UL], Duke Energy Progress [DEPI.UL] and Energy Progress Inc were excluded “based on an assessment of the risk of severe environmental damage”, the central bank’s board said in a statement. At the end of 2015, the Norwegian fund, the world’s largest, held 0.62 percent of Duke Energy, a stake worth $304 million, but it has since sold the shares in Duke and its subsidiaries. The board’s decision was based on a recommendation by the ethics watchdog for the fund, the Council on Ethics. “For many years, these companies have, among other things, repeatedly discharged environmentally harmful substances from a large number of ash basins at coal-fired power plants in North Carolina,” the watchdog said in a separate statement. “Several court rulings have ordered the companies to remove or seal these ash basins. In its assessment, the Council places emphasis on the fact that the planned measures will not be fully implemented for another 10-15 years,” the ethics council said. The council also said it perceived, “the long-lasting and extensive breaches of the environmental legislation to be a considerable risk factor”. Duke Energy said the fund had signaled its intention for some time but it was nevertheless disappointed. “It is unfortunate that (the fund) did not consider Duke Energy’s proactive actions to enhance our environmental stewardship and close ash basins across our jurisdictions,” the firm said in an emailed statement to Reuters, adding that it had made “significant progress”. “Since 2011, we have retired more than 40 coal units across our generation fleet and this process will continue,” it added. Some 113 companies and their subsidiaries have so far been excluded from the wealth fund on ethical grounds. Two are under observation, including Brazil’s state oil company Petrobras.

The company said it agreed to sell the remainder of its Latin American businesses in Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, El Salvador and Argentina to investment manager I Squared Capital for about $1.2 billion. All the facilities in those countries total 2300 megawatts of power generation.   Earlier, Duke said it agreed to sell its Brazilian unit to clean energy company China Three Gorges Corp for about $1.2 billion. Duke Energy owns 2,090 megawatts (MW) of power generation facilities in Brazil. [nPn21ksRBa] In February, Duke Energy said it was looking to sell its international assets to drive more stable earnings and cash flow growth from the United States. The international business has been hurt by a weak Brazilian currency and economy, as well as drought conditions that hurt the company’s power generation capacity in the country. The businesses, which span Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala and Peru, accounted for nearly 5 percent of Duke Energy’s total operating revenue in 2015. Proceeds from the sales will be used to reduce debt, the company said. Duke’s long-term debt, including items, was about $39.93 billion as of June 30.

279,DUK,Duke Energy shareholder lawsuit over CEO firing moves forward,"(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp’s board must face a shareholder lawsuit over its abrupt 2012 firing of its newly installed chief executive, a Delaware judge has ruled. In a decision on Wednesday, Delaware Vice Chancellor Sam Glasscock denied Duke’s bid to end the case, finding the shareholder plaintiffs plausibly argued that the defendants might have concealed information about their actions from the public and regulators. As part of its $18 billion deal to acquire Progress Energy,  Duke had agreed to install Progress head William Johnson as CEO of the combined company. But within hours of the acquisition’s closing in July 2012, the new Duke board met and fired Johnson, reinstating former Duke CEO James Rogers, in a vote along company lines. Johnson left with a pre-negotiated $44 million severance package. Shareholders almost immediately sued Duke, arguing the decision to terminate him was reached in May 2012 and concealed from the public, investors and regulators. Duke’s share price subsequently fell and the S&P; lowered the company’s credit rating. Duke and the executives and directors named in the lawsuit strongly deny the lawsuit’s allegations and any wrongdoing related to the CEO change after the 2012 merger, Duke said in a statement on Thursday.

324,DUK,UPDATE 1-Court ruling could broaden U.S. government environmental impact studies,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. regulators assessing new gas pipelines must try to analyze their potential to increase greenhouse gas emissions before giving them the go-ahead, an appeals court ruled on Tuesday, in a decision that industry representatives and environmentalists said could have far-reaching effects on infrastructure projects.  The ruling stemmed from a decision by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to approve the Southeast Pipelines Project, three gas pipelines proposed by a consortium of companies including Duke Energy Corp, Spectra Energy Partners and NextEra Energy Inc. Judges on the District of Columbia Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals said in their ruling that before FERC approved the project it should have considered the environmental impact of the greenhouse gases likely to be emitted when gas transported by the pipelines was burned. While some experts said the decision meant little more than an increase in paperwork for regulators, others said it could change the way the federal government decides what issues to examine in environmental impact studies required under the National Environmental Policy Act. In the past regulators have considered only the effects of a project they have the authority to control, which are considered direct effects. But the appeals court’s decision could force them to consider indirect effects as well.  “FERC would obviously prefer to say, ‘We’re approving a pipeline and here are the impacts from digging a trench and laying a pipe,’” said Elly Benson, a lawyer for the Sierra Club, one of the environmental groups that challenged the permit FERC gave for the pipelines in a petition before the appeals court. “What they’re ignoring is the fact that this project includes the transmission of gas that everyone knows is going to be combusted,” added Benson, who called the court’s decision a “very important victory.”  A FERC spokeswoman declined to comment.  Andrea Grover, a spokeswoman for Sabal Trail Transmission, the joint venture company operating the pipeline, said: “We are reviewing the decision. The court’s decision will not affect Sabal Trail’s operations at this time.” The ruling comes a week after President Donald Trump issued an executive order calling for regulators to shorten the process around infrastructure permitting to two years and appoint a lead federal agency to work on permitting for each new project. Deidre Duncan, a partner at Hunton & Williams who represents a number of pipeline companies, said the ruling could foretell “significant” changes to regulators’ permitting duties, forcing regulators to look more broadly at proposed projects before approving them. “If not changed on rehearing or ultimately by the Supreme Court, this case has broad implications for multiple industries and agencies in various contexts,” she said.  The case is Sierra Club et al v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, 16-1329.

325,DUK,Irma knocks out power to nearly four million in Florida: utilities,"(Reuters) - Hurricane Irma knocked out power to nearly 4 million homes and businesses in Florida on Sunday, threatening millions more as it crept up the state’s west coast, and full restoration of service could take weeks, local electric utilities said.  Irma hit Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, but by afternoon as it barreled up the west coast, it weakened to a Category 2 with maximum sustained winds of 110 miles per hour (177 kph). So far, the brunt of the storm has affected Florida Power & Light’s customers in the states’ southern and eastern sections, and its own operations were not immune, either. “We are not subject to any special treatment from Hurricane Irma. We just experienced a power outage at our command center.  We do have backup generation,” FPL spokesman Rob Gould said on Sunday.  FPL, the biggest power company in Florida, said more than 3.2 million of its customers were without power by 10 p.m. (0200 GMT Monday), mostly in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. More than 200,000 had electricity restored, mostly by automated devices. The company’s system will need to be rebuilt, particularly in the western part of the state, Gould said. “That restoration process will be measured in weeks, not days.” FPL is a unit of Florida energy company NextEra Energy Inc.  Large utilities that serve other parts of the state, including units of Duke Energy Corp, Southern Co and Emera Inc, were seeing their outage figures grow as the storm pushed north.  Duke’s outages soared to 390,000 from 60,000 in a span of four hours on Sunday evening, and the company warned its 1.8 million customers in northern and central Florida that outages could ultimately exceed 1 million.  The company updated its website on Sunday evening with a warning to customers that outages may last a week or longer. Emera’s Tampa Electric utility said the storm could affect up to 500,000 of the 730,000 homes and businesses it serves, and over 180,000 had already lost power. The utilities had thousands of workers, some from as far away as California, ready to help restore power once Irma’s high winds pass their service areas. About 17,000 were assisting FPL, nearly 8,000 at Duke and more than 1,300 at Emera. Tampa Electric told customers on Sunday, however, that response crews were halting work because of the high winds.       FPL said on Friday that Irma could affect about 4.1 million customers, but that was before the storm track shifted away from the eastern side of the state. Its customers are concentrated in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. The utility said its two nuclear plants were safe. It shut only one of the two reactors at its Turkey Point nuclear plant about 30 miles (48 km) south of Miami on Saturday, rather than both, because the storm shifted. It plans to leave both reactors in service at the St. Lucie plant about 120 miles (193 km )north of Miami because hurricane-force winds are no longer expected to hit the sites. There is also spent nuclear fuel at Duke’s Crystal River plant, about 90 miles (145 km) north of Tampa. The plant, on Irma’s current forecast track, stopped operating in 2009 and was retired in 2013. In a worst-case scenario, the spent fuel could release radiation if exposed to the air, but a federal nuclear official said that was extremely unlikely. “That fuel is so cold, relatively speaking, it would take weeks before there would be any concern,” said Scott Burnell of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  As the storm has come ashore, gasoline stations have struggled to keep up. In the Atlanta metro area, about 496 stations, or 12.2 percent, were out of gasoline, according to information service Gas Buddy.

There is also spent nuclear fuel at Duke’s Crystal River plant, about 90 miles (145 km) north of Tampa. The plant, on Irma’s current forecast track, stopped operating in 2009 and was retired in 2013. In a worst-case scenario, the spent fuel could release radiation if exposed to the air, but a federal nuclear official said that was extremely unlikely. “That fuel is so cold, relatively speaking, it would take weeks before there would be any concern,” said Scott Burnell of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  As the storm has come ashore, gasoline stations have struggled to keep up. In the Atlanta metro area, about 496 stations, or 12.2 percent, were out of gasoline, according to information service Gas Buddy.

328,DUK,Irma power outages down to 6.9 mln in U.S. Southeast -utilities,"NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Power outages from Hurricane Irma in Florida and nearby states declined to about 6.9 million customers on Tuesday from a peak over 7.4 million late Monday as utilities organized one of the biggest restoration efforts in U.S. history. Some customers in the hardest hit areas of Florida, however, will likely have to wait weeks before their lights come back on. Major utilities in Florida - including NextEra Energy Inc’s Florida Power & Light, Duke Energy Corp and Emera Inc’s Tampa Electric - have mobilized tens of thousands of workers to deal with the enormous power outages after Hurricane Irma landed early Sunday. “This is likely to be one of the largest and most complex power restoration efforts in U.S. history,” said Tom Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, an industry trade group. “An army of more than 50,000 workers from across the United States and Canada is now dedicated to supporting the industry’s Irma restoration efforts,” Kuhn said. That number includes workers from affected companies, mutual assistance crews from other utilities, contractors and other support personnel, he said. Some Florida utilities, including FPL, warned customers it could take weeks to restore power in the hardest hit areas because infrastructure systems in some of those places will need to be rebuilt. Irma hit southwest Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second-highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. It gradually weakened as it headed through the state, becoming a tropical storm and then a tropical depression on Monday. Most outages were still in FPL’s service area in the southern and eastern parts of Florida. FPL, the state’s biggest power company, said its outages dipped below 2.9 million by Tuesday morning from a peak of over 3.6 million Monday morning. In total more than 4.5 million FPL customers were affected by the storm, with over 1.6 million having their service restored already, mostly by automated devices. Florida outages for Duke, the state’s second biggest power company serving the northern and central parts of the state, remained at about 1.2 million overnight, according to the company’s website, while Duke’s outages in North and South Carolina climbed to about 160,000. In Georgia, utilities reported over 1.2 million customers without power Tuesday morning, down from a peak of over 1.4 million on Monday night. FPL said its two nuclear plants in Florida were safe. Both reactors at its Turkey Point facility, about 30 miles (48 km) south of Miami, remained shut early Tuesday, while both reactors at its St. Lucie plant, about 120 miles (190 km) north of Miami, were operating at full power.

329,DUK,"With 7.4 million without power, utility workers get respect","Fort Lauderdale and New York (Reuters) - When more than 7.4 million homes and businesses are without power after a hurricane, utility workers tend to get noticed a bit more than usual. That’s what Gus Beyersdorf, 40, and his colleague Nick Jensen, 32, utility workers from Wisconsin, found out while inspecting power lines in Florida on Monday. The two - among the thousands of power-line workers brought in from out-of-state by major utilities - spent about five minutes outside a house in Fort Lauderdale, when two cars with women who said they lived in the neighborhood stopped to inquire about the return of power to their homes - obviously trying to get their attention. “I think you guys are sexy. Men in hard hats are attractive!” said one of the women, obviously just joking with the Wisconsin men, but also making it clear that she would like it if they would get the power turned back on at her house.  Major utilities in the state - including Florida Power & Light Co, Duke Energy Corp  and Tampa Electric - have mobilized tens of thousands of workers to deal with the enormous power outages, which by Monday evening numbered more than 7.4 million homes and businesses after Hurricane Irma landed as a Category 4 storm early Sunday.  While the numbers in Florida were declining slightly, more outages were being reported in Georgia and other states as Irma, now a tropical storm, moved north. Beyersdorf and Jensen left northern Wisconsin on Friday morning and raced to southern Florida to be in place ahead of Irma’s impact. Between 2,000 and 3,000 utility workers from out-of-state are staying at BB&T; Stadium in Broward County, which is home to the National Hockey League’s Florida Panthers, said Beyersdorf.  Power losses in Georgia, which were nearing 900,000 as of 3 p.m. EDT, were expected to increase as the storm moved north.  In Florida, the state’s biggest electric company said its outages dipped to 3.3 million from a peak of 3.6 million earlier on Monday. A total of almost 4.5 million Florida Power & Light customers have been affected by the storm, with about 1 million getting service restored, mostly by automated devices. “We’ve never had that many outages, and I don’t think any utility in the country ever has,” FPL Chief Executive Eric Silagy said at a news conference on Monday. “It is by far and away the largest in the history of our company.” FPL said it was still assessing the damage and could not yet say when it would restore service to most customers. Some homes and businesses could be without power for weeks, especially in the hardest-hit areas like southwest Florida, the NextEra Energy Inc unit said. “It took a week for Matthew,” Jensen said, referring to a hurricane that last year did not make landfall in Florida but caused power outages. “This one is going to take a lot longer.” As Irma pushed north, outage figures were increasing at other large utilities, including units of Duke Energy, Southern Co and Emera Inc.  Duke’s outages held around 1.2 million on Monday evening, while Emera’s Tampa Electric utility said outages eased to about 320,000 from a peak earlier on Monday of over 330,000. FPL said its two nuclear plants were safe. Both units at its Turkey Point facility, about 30 miles (48 km) south of Miami, were shut by early Monday. At its St. Lucie nuclear plant about 120 miles (190 km) north of Miami, FPL reduced power at Unit 1 because of salt buildup from Irma in the switchyard, NRC spokesman Roger Hannah said. The plant’s other reactor, Unit 2, continued to operate at full power. Irma is expected to sap demand for fuel for a time, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note on Monday, but they cautioned that supply could remain strained because of refining capacity offline after Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas two weeks ago.

331,DUK,Irma death toll at 82 as 1.5 million without power in storm's wake,"FORT MYERS, Fla., Sept 15 (Reuters) - The death toll from Hurricane Irma was at 82 early on Friday as 1.5 million homes and businesses in Florida remained without power in sweltering heat, five days after the historic storm ripped through southeast U.S. NextEra Energy Inc’s (NEE.N) FPL, Florida’s biggest electric company, said on Friday about 1.1 million customers had no power, while Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N) reported that more than 371,000 customers were in the dark and Tampa Electric, a unit of Emera Inc (EMA.TO), reported about 39,000 were without power. Irma, which had ranked as one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record before striking the U.S. mainland as a Category 4 hurricane on Sunday, has been blamed for at least 82 deaths, with several hard-hit Caribbean islands, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, accounting for more than half the fatalities. At least 32 deaths have been reported in Florida and seven more combined in Georgia and South Carolina. The death toll includes eight elderly patients who died after being exposed to sweltering heat inside a Miami-area nursing home left with little or no air conditioning after the hurricane struck. The deaths at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills stirred outrage at what many saw as a preventable tragedy, and heightened concerns about the vulnerability of the state’s large elderly population amid widespread, lingering power outages. “It was unnecessary,” Bendetta Craig, whose 87-year-old mother was among dozens of patients safely removed from the center, told reporters on Thursday. “I don’t know what happened inside. I wasn’t there. I hope the truth comes out. It is just senseless,” she said. Police obtained a search warrant on Thursday in their criminal investigation into the deaths while Florida’s healthcare agency ordered a Miami-area nursing home suspended from the state Medicaid program. High temperatures were forecast to reach the upper 80s Fahrenheit (low 30s Celsius) in Florida’s two biggest cities, Jacksonville and Miami, and the mid-80s F (around 30 C) in Atlanta over the next week or so, according to meteorologists at AccuWeather. FPL, which serves nearly 5 million homes and businesses, said it expects to restore power to essentially all its users, in the eastern portion of Florida, by the end of the weekend and the harder-hit western portion of the state by Sept. 22. Duke Energy Corp, which serves the northern and central parts of Florida, said on its website it expects to restore service to most customers by midnight Sept. 17. Irma rampaged through the Caribbean, devastating several islands and raking the northern shore of Cuba last week before barreling into the Florida Keys island chain on Sunday with sustained winds of up to 130 miles per hour (215 km/h). An estimated 20 percent of Florida’s gas stations had no fuel on Thursday, down from a peak of 46 percent, according to fuel information service Gas Buddy. U.S. President Donald Trump visited Gulf Coast Florida communities recovering from the hurricane on Thursday, praising first-responders for their role in limiting the loss of life. The U.S. Justice Department has received more than 400 fraud complaints involving relief aid after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and expects a spike in fraud complaints in the coming months, department officials said on Thursday.

335,DUK,"INSIGHT-A year after Trump's election, coal's future remains bleak","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A year after Donald Trump was elected president on a promise to revive the ailing U.S. coal industry, the sector’s long-term prospects for growth and hiring remain as bleak as ever. A Reuters review of mining data shows an industry that has seen only modest gains in jobs and production this year - much of it from a temporary uptick in foreign demand for U.S. coal rather than presidential policy changes. U.S. utilities are shutting coal-fired power plants at a rapid pace and shifting to cheap natural gas, along with wind and solar power. And domestic demand makes up about 90 percent of the market for U.S. coal. “We’re not planning to build any additional coal facilities,” said Melissa McHenry, a spokeswoman for American Electric Power, one of the largest U.S. utilities. “The future for coal is dictated by economics … and you can’t make those kinds of investments based on one administration’s politics.”  Coal plants now make up 47 percent of AEP’s capacity for power generation, a figure it plans to shrink to 33 percent by 2030. (For a graphic on coal production, demand and employment, see: tmsnrt.rs/2zKY1tQ) The situation highlights the limitations of presidential policy on major industries and global economic trends. As some energy experts have said all along, the forces that will make or break mining are well beyond the powers of the Oval Office. A White House official did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has likely done all he can do to help the industry, said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, which represents major U.S. coal companies.  “The government is no longer against us,” he said. “We now only have market forces to contend with.” Trump has taken action on many promises he made to coal interests in states that helped him win the election. The president started the process of killing former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, meant to reduce carbon emissions from power plants; ended an Obama-era moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands; ditched limits on dumping coal waste into streams; and started withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. Now Trump’s Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, is attempting to push a rule through the independent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that would subsidize power plants that store at least a 90-day supply of coal on site. The goal is to extend the life of some coal burning power plants, a move Perry says will make the electric grid more reliable. While the full impact of Trump’s coal policy could take years to understand, the changes so far are unlikely to boost domestic demand, energy analysts and utility officials said. Trump has cast the coal industry as a victim of burdensome regulation. The industry has lost more than 40 percent of its work force in less than a decade and seen production drop to its lowest levels since 1978. Its share of the power market has fallen to less than a third from about half in 2003. “We’re going to bring the coal industry back 100 percent,” Trump said at a rally in Virginia in August of 2016. So far, progress has been limited. U.S. coal production is on track to rise more than 8 percent in 2017 over the previous year, to 790 million tons, according to the Energy Information Administration. But 2018 output is expected to decline. The number of coal miners has also risen slightly to 51,900 in October, up about 2,200 since November 2016 - but down about 70 percent from a 1985 peak, according to the Labor Department. On November 1, Trump cited the modest production increases in a Tweet, saying, “It is finally happening for our great clean coal miners!” But these increases are largely attributable to demand for U.S. coal from Asian steel mills after temporary outages from their usual suppliers in Australia, according to James Stevenson, a coal analyst at IHS Markit. During the first six months of 2017, Asian countries took in 7.5 million short tons of U.S. coal, up 97 percent over the same period in 2016, according to the EIA. That demand will soon fade, Stevenson said. “We are not going to get a repeat of 2017,” he said of the spike in exports. Forecasts from utilities and the U.S. government reveal little reason for hope of a sustained coal rebound. Utilities are expected to shut down more than 13,600 megawatts of coal plant capacity in 2018. That follows a loss of nearly 8,000 MW this year and 13,000 MW in 2016, according to EIA and Thomson Reuters data.  By 2025, coal-fired power plant capacity will dip to 226,380 MW, down about 30 percent from 2011, according to EIA. Three Texas coal plants owned by Vistra Energy Corp subsidiary Luminant are among the latest to close, bringing the number of plants that shut, or plan to, to 265 since 2010 - a figure higher than the 258 plants that remain, according to the Sierra Club, which has campaigned against coal. Vistra said the closures were forced by lower prices for natural gas and renewable power - and not by environmental regulations. Duke Energy, one of the country’s largest utilities, has shut down more than 5,400 MW of coal capacity since 2011 and plans to shed another 2,000 MW by 2024. Over the next decade, Duke plans to invest $11 billion in new natural gas and renewable power - and nothing in new coal-fired generation, said spokesman Rick Rhodes. A Nov. 2 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis - which has two of the largest coal producers in its district, Peabody Energy Corp and Arch Coal Inc - said coal-fired power plants “may eventually become obsolete.” Coal companies believe they can survive despite the troubling market outlook. Peabody expects a “modest number” of coal power plant retirements in the coming years, with some of that lost capacity shifting to remaining plants that will increase output, spokesman Vic Svec said. Arch spokeswoman Logan Bonacorsi offered a similar forecast.   Robert Murray, the chief executive of privately-held Murray Energy Corp - one of America’s biggest underground miners - said Trump could do more for the industry. The administration, Murray said, should end tax breaks for wind and solar power and reverse an EPA finding that carbon emissions endanger human health. But Trump’s tax bill last week preserved most solar incentives, which have bi-partisan backing. And the EPA has so far steered clear of the so-called “endangerment finding” on emissions that is the basis of many fossil-fuel regulations, given the breadth of scientific evidence that would be needed to reverse it. Murray Energy, meanwhile, announced on Oct. 31 it will buy a 30.5 percent stake in a coal-mining partnership in Utah called Canyon Consolidated Resources, LLC. The deal might help the companies cut costs, but it’s unlikely to help workers: Murray said about 200 of 1,000 jobs in Utah could be lost.

344,DUK,$2 billion share issue takes shine off Duke Energy profit beat,"(Reuters) - U.S. power provider Duke Energy Corp said on Tuesday it would issue $2 billion in new shares this year to deal with the financial impact of recent tax reforms that it also said would weigh on 2018 earnings growth. Shares of the biggest U.S. utility by generation capacity fell as much as 2.5 percent as the announcement overshadowed better-than-expected fourth quarter profits driven by colder weather and a drop in costs. (bit.ly/2EUKDFw) The company also forecast 2018 adjusted earnings in a range of $4.55-$4.85 per share, compared with $4.57 in 2017. That falls below Duke’s plans to grow earnings by 4 percent to 6 percent annually till 2022.  “The effects of the lower corporate tax rate, including the dilution from planned equity issuances, will partially offset ... organic growth,” said Chief Financial Officer Steve Young said on a post-earnings call.  The new issuance and the weak guidance would also lead investors to bring down their expectations for 2018, Guggenheim Securities LLC analyst Shahriar Pourreza said. “There is a large equity overhang ... which is probably driving the shares down,” he said. While the new tax code passed in December reduces the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, state regulators have ordered utilities to pass on the benefits to customers in the form of lower rates.  Duke, which serves about 7.6 million customers, said earlier this month that it would pass on savings from the new federal tax laws to North Carolina customers. (bit.ly/2HtmS5Y) “Because Duke Energy is not a significant cash taxpayer, any reduction to customer rates will place downward pressure on our consolidated cash flows,” Young said.  Duke, valued at $53 billion, has been expanding its business through acquisitions and investment in renewable energy and power generation stations for electric vehicles. The company, which like other power providers spends a large chunk of its revenue on maintenance, said it lowered the costs of running its power plants by 11 cents per share in the reported quarter.  Operating revenue from its electric utilities unit, which accounts for the bulk of Duke’s overall business, rose 3.3 percent to $5.10 billion. Net income attributable to the company rose to $703 million, or $1 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a loss of $227 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.

(bit.ly/2EUKDFw) The company also forecast 2018 adjusted earnings in a range of $4.55-$4.85 per share, compared with $4.57 in 2017. That falls below Duke’s plans to grow earnings by 4 percent to 6 percent annually till 2022.  “The effects of the lower corporate tax rate, including the dilution from planned equity issuances, will partially offset ... organic growth,” said Chief Financial Officer Steve Young said on a post-earnings call.  The new issuance and the weak guidance would also lead investors to bring down their expectations for 2018, Guggenheim Securities LLC analyst Shahriar Pourreza said. “There is a large equity overhang ... which is probably driving the shares down,” he said. While the new tax code passed in December reduces the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, state regulators have ordered utilities to pass on the benefits to customers in the form of lower rates.  Duke, which serves about 7.6 million customers, said earlier this month that it would pass on savings from the new federal tax laws to North Carolina customers. (bit.ly/2HtmS5Y) “Because Duke Energy is not a significant cash taxpayer, any reduction to customer rates will place downward pressure on our consolidated cash flows,” Young said.  Duke, valued at $53 billion, has been expanding its business through acquisitions and investment in renewable energy and power generation stations for electric vehicles. The company, which like other power providers spends a large chunk of its revenue on maintenance, said it lowered the costs of running its power plants by 11 cents per share in the reported quarter.  Operating revenue from its electric utilities unit, which accounts for the bulk of Duke’s overall business, rose 3.3 percent to $5.10 billion. Net income attributable to the company rose to $703 million, or $1 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a loss of $227 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, Duke Energy earned 94 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

353,DUK,U.S. companies found ways to avoid taxes before tax cut bill -report,"WASHINGTON, April 10 (Reuters) - Fifteen U.S. corporations including online retailer Amazon.com Inc, power company Duke Energy Corp and insurer Prudential Financial Inc avoided U.S. tax on nearly $25 billion in combined profits last year, a tax watchdog group said on Tuesday. A report by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, or ITEP, said data showed how profitable Fortune 500 companies have routinely lowered their tax bills long before the Republican tax overhaul signed into law by President Donald Trump in December. The 15 corporations had profits of $24.5 billion in 2017 but managed to obtain nearly $1.4 billion in rebates from the U.S. Treasury for a combined tax rate of minus 5.6 percent, according to the ITEP report, which examined corporate income tax disclosures. The nonpartisan group said the new U.S. tax regime, which slashed the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent beginning in January, will likely allow corporations avoid even more tax. ITEP said while “disclosures made by these companies are too vague to allow a complete diagnosis of how they are avoiding income taxes” they used a variety of tax breaks to cut their tax bills. Amazon received a $137 million federal rebate on $5.4 billion in U.S. profits, resulting an effective tax rate of negative 2.5 percent, by using a tax break that allows companies to write off the value of executive stock options, according to ITEP. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Duke Energy obtained a $247 million rebate on $4.2 billion in U.S. profits by using accelerated depreciation on capital investments and renewable energy production tax credits to lower its federal tax rate to a minus 5.9 percent, the report said. Officials at Amazon.com and Duke Energy were not immediately available for comment. Last year’s tax legislation dramatically expanded the depreciation tax break used by Fortune 500 corporations, the group said. Prudential Financial, which has operations in investment management and other financial services in addition to insurance, reduced its effective federal tax rate to negative 1.9 percent on $2.5 billion in U.S. profits partly through low-income housing credits, ITEP said. Officials at Prudential also were not immediately available for comment.
