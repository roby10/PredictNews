1,WFC,BofA loses bid to end nationwide mortgage lawsuit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp lost its bid to dismiss a nationwide lawsuit accusing it of reneging on promises to help borrowers modify their mortgage loans under a much-criticized federal program.  District Judge Rya Zobel in Boston said homeowners who contend they did not get modifications for which they qualified under the two-year-old Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, could pursue claims against Bank of America.  The complaint “meticulously” detailed each plaintiff’s compliance with loan modification conditions, but said the bank “willfully failed” to modify the loans, either in bad faith or for its own economic benefit, Zobel wrote. Such allegations are “sufficient” to let the lawsuit go forward, she added.  Zobel dismissed some other claims and rejected a request to block Bank of America while the lawsuit is pending from foreclosing on 37 borrowers said to be in “imminent danger” of losing their homes.  A Bank of America spokeswoman had no immediate comment.  The lawsuit was brought on behalf of 46 homeowners who tried to participate in HAMP to avoid foreclosures,  It combines 26 cases that had been brought in 19 states, and seeks class-action status for various plaintiffs.  Last week, Bank of America said it would take $20 billion of charges for various mortgage matters, including over its 2008 purchase of Countrywide Financial Corp.  Like several rivals, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank has also been in talks with state and federal regulators to resolve claims over alleged foreclosure abuses.  HAMP was created in 2009 as a centerpiece of efforts by the Obama administration to boost the nation’s housing sector.  While it provides incentives to loan servicers to encourage modifications, HAMP has been widely derided as ineffective.  Through May, 731,451 borrowers had received permanent loan modifications, far below the original goal of 3 million to 4 million.

3,WFC,Analysis: JPMorgan close to becoming the top U.S. lender,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is close to vaulting past Bank of America Corp to become the biggest bank in the United States, but it will likely get there in an odd way — by shrinking less than its rival.  Both JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are getting smaller as they shake off the excesses of the years leading up to the financial crisis.  If JPMorgan becomes the biggest, chief executive Jamie Dimon could see the validation of his cautious management before and during the crisis. Bank of America’s drop to second would illustrate how former Chief Executive Ken Lewis saddled the bank with bad acquisitions that are hampering current CEO Brian Moynihan.  But bigger might not be better. Being the largest does not necessarily translate to higher profitability, or a higher market value. Global banking regulators are imposing higher capital requirements on the largest banks and threatening even higher capital charges if they grow.  “Big is more a burden than it is a bragging right,” said Gary Townsend, chief executive of asset manager Hill-Townsend Capital, a Chevy Chase, Maryland-based money manager that specializes in financial stocks and owns shares of both banks.  That is a switch from the years when Bank of America was buying up banks to cater to the American appetite for more and more borrowing, said Ray Soifer, a long-time bank analyst and now industry consultant at Soifer Consultant in Green Valley, Arizona.  “Bigger was better and banks were happy to be at the top,” said Soifer.  JPMorgan has been gaining ground on Bank of America for three straight quarters. At the end of March, JPMorgan’s $2.20 trillion of assets were just 3.4 percent short of Bank of America’s $2.27 trillion. JPMorgan already is the most valuable bank in the stock market, with its equity worth nearly 50 percent more than Bank of America’s.  Analysts differ as to how soon the switch could happen. Deutsche Bank’s Matt O’Connor sees JPMorgan becoming the largest by year end. FBR Capital Markets’ Paul Miller says it will be the next 12 to 18 months.  But however long it takes, analysts agree neither bank is going to be stretching.  “It is really going to be who shrinks the least,” said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.  Even if JPMorgan becomes the largest U.S. bank by assets, it would not be the biggest in the world. The bank is about $600 billion short of that title and there are six other banks between it and the biggest. That honor at last count went to BNP Paribas SA. (For a list of the biggest banks in the world, please double click: r.reuters.com/zyq52s )  JPMorgan spokesman Joseph Evangelisti declined to comment.  The trend down in the U.S. might not follow a straight line. Banks sometimes temporarily pump up balance sheets to manage their interest rate risk, said Soifer. And there may be lending upturns along the way in borrowing by businesses, as just happened.  Federal Reserve data show the combined assets of 25 large U.S. banks grew by one-half of one percent in the second quarter, largely because of more lending to companies.  But in general, analysts said, banks are no more likely to grow now than their customers are to try to borrow their way to happiness on the strength of higher home prices.  Bank of America and JPMorgan have particular reasons to shrink. To start, they have portfolios of bad assets acquired just before or during the financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase still has more than $80 billion of low-credit quality mortgage and credit card loans, largely acquired when it took over failed lender Washington Mutual in 2008.  As of March 31, Bank of America had more than $100 billion of loans in runoff, mainly in a shrinking portfolio known as the legacy asset servicing division formed in January. Many of the assets are mortgages or home equity loans acquired from Countrywide Financial, which it bought in 2008.  Both banks are likely to let those loans mature without making new ones to replace them, a process known as “running off” assets.  The Countrywide acquisition was a particularly big mistake for Bank of America, FBR’s Miller said. The deal has already cost the bank more than $20 billion of its capital, he said. Some of that money is going out the door in the bank’s recent $8.5 billion settlement of warranty claims by more than 22 institutional investors over allegedly faulty mortgage-backed securities Countrywide sold.  Bank of America is selling assets and even closing some bank branches as it tries to strengthen its balance sheet by getting smaller.  The bank’s goal is “to balance the appropriate amount of assets and risk,” said Jerry Dubrowski, a Bank of America spokesman. “Having the largest amount of assets does not make you the best financial services provider and, right now, we’re focused on that.”  ",7072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-biggest/analysis-jpmorgan-close-to-becoming-the-top-u-s-lender-idUSTRE76676820110707
4,WFC,Wells Fargo settles mortgage case for $125 million,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) has agreed to pay $125 million to settle a lawsuit over the sale of mortgage pass-through certificates, according to court documents.  Holders of mortgage pass-through certificates are entitled to income payments from pools of mortgage loans or mortgage-backed securities.  A group of pension funds brought a proposed class action lawsuit against Wells and several underwriters in 2009, accusing the bank of misrepresenting the quality of loans in the pools.  The lawsuit originally targeted Wells Fargo-sponsored offerings from 2005 through 2007 worth over $67.5 billion, court papers show.

Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said on Thursday that the settlement does not constitute an admission of liability or violation of any law.

6,WFC,BofA loses bid to end HAMP mortgage lawsuit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp lost its bid to dismiss a lawsuit accusing it of reneging on promises to help borrowers modify their mortgage loans under a much-criticized federal program.  The bank, however, claimed a partial victory, citing District Judge Rya Zobel’s decision to dismiss claims by borrowers who sought to participate in the two-year-old Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP.  Zobel nonetheless ruled that homeowners who contend they did not get modifications for which they qualified under HAMP, to avoid foreclosures, could pursue claims against Bank of America.  The complaint “meticulously” detailed each of these plaintiffs’ compliance with loan modification conditions, but said the bank “willfully failed” to modify the loans, either in bad faith or for its own economic benefit, Zobel wrote. Such allegations are “sufficient” to let the lawsuit go forward, she added.  Zobel rejected claims by borrowers who claimed they were “intended beneficiaries” of HAMP but never entered the program, saying they had no contractual right to relief.  She also rejected a request to block Bank of America while the lawsuit is pending from foreclosing on 37 borrowers said to be in “imminent danger” of losing their homes.  In a statement, Bank of America spokeswoman Shirley Norton said the company is pleased that four of the eight counts in the complaint were dismissed.  The lawsuit combines 26 cases that had been brought in 19 states, and sought class-action status for various plaintiffs.  “The Court’s conclusions will likely help hundreds of thousands of families to convert temporary mortgage modification plans into permanently lower monthly payments. Tens of thousands of foreclosures are likely to be prevented,” said Gary Klein, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, adding that he expects the case to get class certification quickly.

8,WFC,Ex-hedge fund manager settles trading violation,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Former hedge fund manager Forrest Fontana, who once worked for industry titan Steven A. Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors, will pay nearly $1 million to resolve claims he violated a short-selling rule, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday.  Financial regulators charged that Fontana Capital LLC, which traded mostly in financial stocks, earned about $816,184 on trades involving three financial stocks.  Fontana violated Rule 105 of Regulation M, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in an order imposing sanctions and a cease and desist order. The rule prohibits investors from participating in public offerings after having shorted the same securities.  According to the government, Fontana broke the rule on three occasions between July 2008 through November 2008, with trades on XL Group Plc, Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo & Co, the SEC said.  He will now pay a disgorgement of $816,184, prejudgment interest of $3,606 and a civil penalty of $165,000 to the United States Treasury, the SEC said.  The SEC filed the administrative order against Fontana six months ago, alleging the firm earned unlawful profits of about  $1,101,000.  Fontana’s lawyer did not return a call seeking comment.  The SEC has brought a number of these cases and only last week settled a similar matter with hedge fund Level Global, which has been embroiled in the government’s insider trading case.  Fontana, who worked at mutual fund powerhouses Fidelity and Putnam before moving to SAC, launched his own business in Boston in 2005 with $50 million in start-up capital from his former SAC boss, Cohen, and quickly generated buzz in the local investment community.  But by 2010, he was effectively out of business, managing no funds for clients and concentrating on his work as one of five selectmen who help govern the town of Winchester, north of Boston.

10,WFC,Banks to detail foreclosure fixes next week,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banks will submit plans to federal regulators next week on how they will overhaul their foreclosure practices, even as related settlement talks with states and the Justice Department drag on.  Last month, banking regulators delayed the deadline for submitting these plans until July 13 at the request of the Justice Department.  The hope was that by then, the states, Justice Department and major banks would strike their own partial settlement that could be tucked into the foreclosure revamp plans banks must submit to their direct regulators as part of a separate settlement reached in April.  “We are making a lot of progress, but we will not finish next week,” said Geoff Greenwood, a spokesman for Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who is leading the negotiations on behalf of state governments.  This marks the latest stumble as federal and state regulators negotiate various deals with major banks to get them to pay fines for foreclosure shortcuts and fix them going forward.  Bank of America Corp, Wells Fargo & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Ally Financial have been the main players in the talks.  The government has been probing them and other firms for shoddy mortgage practices, including the use of “robo-signers” to sign hundreds of unread foreclosure documents a day.  Settlement talks have been going on for months without a clear path to conclusion, even as all involved say they want to put the issue behind them.  Bank investors are watching the negotiations closely to see how much the institutions might have to pay up in fines. That figure has been estimated at about $20 billion for the industry.  The most concrete progress so far has been a partial settlement the major banks reached in April with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve and the Office of Thrift Supervision.  As part of that pact, the 14 large housing lenders agreed to overhaul mortgage operations and compensate borrowers who were wrongly foreclosed.  No monetary penalty has been announced as part of this agreement.  Among the issue to be addressed in the plans due next week are:  — How banks will make sure affidavits are not filed in court where an employee falsely vouches for personally knowing the details in a foreclosure case to be true;  — Making sure there is a single point of contact for borrowers involved in a foreclosure or loan modification program; and  — How banks will end the so-called “dual tracking” practice of starting a foreclosure while a loan modification is pending.  A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said that, while a deal will not be done by next week, the negotiations between the Justice Department, states and banks have had an impact.  “The negotiations have guided these action plans that are going to come out,” said spokeswoman Jessica Smith.  The banking regulators have to approve the plans and they could be revised at a later date.

Giannone and Jochelle Mendonca   NEW YORK/BANGALORE, July 8 (Reuters) - An arbitration panel ordered Wells Fargo Advisors to pay former broker Gregory Kipple almost $7 million in damages and other costs after concluding he was wrongfully fired by the firm in 2009.   In what is one of the largest awards granted to an individual under FINRA arbitration, the No. 3 U.S. brokerage firm must pay Kipple $4.3 million to compensate him for lost earnings, plus $1 million in punitive damages for violating New Jersey’s Conscientious Employee Protection Act.   Arbitrators this week also awarded Kipple an additional $1 million for defamation and ordered the bank to pay $530,000 in costs and attorney’s fees, according to a ruling posted Friday by FINRA, the regulator that oversees broker arbitration.   The firm also must update Kipple’s employment record, known as a Form U-5, to note he was “terminated without cause.”   “Mr. Kipple argued, and the panel agreed, that he was made a scapegoat by the firm to protect themselves from their own regulatory and management failures,” said Kipple’s attorney, David Wechsler of Wechsler & Cohen LLP.   Wells Fargo (WFC.N) spokesman Anthony Mattera said the bank was “disappointed” by the panel’s decision and was reviewing its options.   As with most arbitration rulings, the panel did not explain its decision,   Kipple was a Marlton, New Jersey, broker for Wachovia Securities, which became part of Wells Fargo Advisors after Wells bought Wachovia in 2008.   In April 2009, the firm settled with a customer who claimed $250,000 in damages, saying Kipple and his branch manager failed to supervise an associate’s handling of an account. The firm settled the matter — known as the Sharkey complaint — for $160,000, in June 2009.   Wells Fargo told regulators it fired Kipple in August 2009 for his “failure to follow the firm’s policies related to ‘know your customers.’”   Kipple, in a response included in his BrokerCheck record, said he had no direct involvement with Patricia Sharkey.   “I was the listed broker on the Sharkey account, but had no direct interaction with Ms. Sharkey,” he wrote. Sharkey worked with another broker on Kipple’s team, he wrote.   Kipple also explained that he had provided an explanation of the facts surrounding the dispute to FINRA without first providing his letter to Wells’ lawyers. Two weeks after telling Wells what he had done, he was fired, Kipple said.   “Mr. Kipple satisfied his duties by writing a letter to FINRA. For that, (Wells) fired him and they defamed him on his U-5,” Wechsler said. “He was a sacrificial lamb for what was a lengthy series of institutional and systemic failures to address another broker’s conduct.”    Kipple started his brokerage career 26 years ago at Nielson & Clark, quickly moving to Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney and then UBS. He landed at Wachovia in October 2003. Since his termination in August 2009, he has been registered with Saxony Securities, a closely held independent broker-dealer.   BrokerCheck shows Kipple was the subject of at least five customer complaints during his career, including a case where Wachovia paid $86,000 to settle with a customer who claimed damages related to unsuitable trading in mutual funds and unauthorized options trading.   In another case, UBS paid $150,000 to settle complaints that a Kipple assistant sold double the number of options contracts as requested by the client.   Wechsler played down the complaints, saying most were related to “operational” mistakes outside Kipple’s control. Wechsler also noted that several customers — including one of his complainants — testified on Kipple’s behalf during the arbitration process.  (Reporting by Joseph A.

13,WFC,Ex-hedge fund manager settles trading violation,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Former hedge fund manager Forrest Fontana, who once worked for industry titan Steven A. Cohen’s SAC Capital Advisors, will pay nearly $1 million to resolve claims that he violated a short-selling rule, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday.  Financial regulators charged that Fontana, whose Boston-based Fontana Capital LLC traded mostly in financial stocks, helped his investors earn unlawful profits of about $816,184 by having participated in public offerings after having shorted the same securities.  According to the government Fontana violated Rule 105 of Regulation M, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in an order imposing sanctions and a cease and desist order.  Fontana broke the rule on three occasions between July 2008 through November 2008 with trades on XL Group PLC (XL.N), Merrill Lynch, and Wells Fargo (WFC.N), the SEC said.  He will now pay a disgorgement of $816,184, prejudgment interest of $3,606 and a civil penalty of $165,000 to the United States Treasury, the SEC said.  Fontana’s lawyer was not immediately available for comment.  The SEC has brought a number of these types of cases in the last months and only last week settled a similar matter with hedge fund Level Global, which has been embroiled in the government’s insider trading case.  Fontana launched his own business in Boston in 2005 with $50 million in start-up capital from his former SAC boss, Cohen, and quickly generated buzz in the local investment community.  But by 2010, he was effectively out of business, managing no funds for clients and concentrating on his work as one of five selectmen in the town of Winchester, north of Boston.

15,WFC,Democrats back power to block state consumer laws,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Democratic senators are defending a top U.S. regulator’s power to shield the nation’s largest banks from certain state consumer financial laws.  The issue of “preemption” has flared in recent weeks as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Treasury Department have sparred over how to interpret a standard laid out in last year’s Dodd-Frank financial oversight law.  In late June, Treasury criticized the OCC’s proposed rule to carry out the legislative standard, arguing the proposal still interprets the OCC’s ability to block state laws too broadly.  On Friday, Senators Tom Carper and Mark Warner said it is the Treasury whose interpretation of the law is wrong and that the OCC should still have the power to shield national banks from a paralyzing patchwork of state laws that could restrict financial products.  “While we understand that the position of the Administration was to eliminate federal preemption for national banks, the fact is that Congress did not accept that position,” the senators wrote in their letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.  States and consumer groups have been feuding with the OCC for years, contending the agency has not been aggressive enough in policing bank lending abuses and have been too friendly to the banks.  Dodd-Frank was supposed to lay out more explicitly when the OCC can block state laws that would impact the products of national banks such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo.  Carper and Warner, who are part of the centrist wing of the Democratic party, authored the preemption language contained in the law. It represents a more moderate change than the Obama administration and several congressional Democrats had wanted.

19,WFC,Watchdog eyes standards to beef up broker audits,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Auditors would have to step up scrutiny of the way U.S. broker-dealers handle customer funds under proposed standards meant to prevent a repeat of the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme.  The proposed audit standards, approved for public comment on Tuesday by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, would apply to about 5,000 broker-dealers, though smaller brokers would be exempt from some portions.  Brokerages such as Bank of America Corp’s Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Wells Fargo already must have their financial statements audited; the new standards would require auditors to put more focus on fraud risks and whether brokers are meeting customer protection rules.  “The intent here is to provide meaningful protection” for customer assets, said James Doty, chairman of the PCAOB.  The proposed standards take the size of brokers into account and “haven’t put a lot of new regulatory apparatus” on auditors who have been auditing broker-dealers in the past, he said.  Regulators have been on guard since the Securities and Exchange Commission failed to catch Bernard Madoff’s massive Ponzi scheme. Madoff used an obscure auditing firm, Friehling and Horowitz, which was not registered with the PCAOB.  Last month the SEC proposed several reforms to better protect funds held by brokers.  The PCAOB’s proposed audit standards apply to two new auditor reports proposed by the SEC.  Auditors of broker-dealers that control customer funds would have to file an examination report showing they checked brokers’ controls over customer assets. For broker-dealers that do not control customer funds, the auditor would file a report attesting to that fact.  The PCAOB also proposed standards on how auditors review information outside financial statements, such as the ways net capital is calculated and how customer assets are controlled.  The 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act created the PCAOB to police auditors after accounting scandals led to the collapse of Enron and WorldCom. That act gave the PCAOB the authority to inspect auditors of public companies, though the board did not have oversight authority over broker-dealer auditors until passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law in 2010.  PCAOB member Dan Goelzer said he hoped investors, brokers and auditors would comment on how to make sure standards work well, especially for smaller broker dealers.  Since most brokers do not hold customer accounts, they would not require the same level of auditing effort as clearing firms, he said.  “Still, as the board knows from experience, striking the right balance in this kind of audit area is tricky,” Goelzer said.

21,WFC,"S&P; says Dodd-Frank doesn't end ""too big to fail"""," * Dodd-Frank includes power to dismantle financial firms   * Power designed to remove idea some firms too big to fail   * S&P says extraordinary government support still possible   WASHINGTON, July 12 (Reuters) - The Dodd-Frank financial oversight law has not ended “too big to fail,” and the U.S. government still may step in to save a toppling financial giant during the next crisis, Standard & Poor’s said in a report on Tuesday.   The rating agency’s report acknowledges policymakers’ desire to make clear that the government in the future will not step in to bail out big financial firms.   But S&P says the government’s long track record of finding ways to prop up critical financial firms trumps the intentions of the legislative framework.   “We believe that under certain circumstances and with selected systemically important financial institutions, future extraordinary government support is still possible,” the report says.   Last year’s Dodd-Frank law gives regulators the power to seize a large financial firm that is headed for disaster and dismantle it in a way that is less disruptive than either taxpayer bailouts or bankruptcy.   The crisis that peaked in the fall of 2008 pushed some of the most storied financial firms to the brink of collapse. Some, such as AIG (AIG.N), were bailed out by the government; others, such as Lehman Brothers, were not and went bankrupt.   So far, markets have been skeptical that this new so-called Orderly Liquidation Authority will ever be invoked, and even if it is, its detractors say that it will not work as intended.   Proponents led by recently departed Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair got a boost last month from Moody’s Investors Service.   In a June 2 report, Moody’s said it may downgrade the debt ratings of Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), citing concerns about waning U.S. political willingness to offer support for the largest banks.   S&P, however, said on Tuesday that in the face of an unpredictable financial crisis, the liquidation authority may not work, and government may step in with support.   “Ultimately, in our views of new legislation and regulation, we need to consider the long track-record of extraordinary support that may be essential for a handful of institutions despite government reluctance to offer such support,” S&P said.

22,WFC,GAO says Volcker rule will be tough to enforce,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators do not yet know enough about Wall Street’s proprietary trading to effectively police it, according to a government report released on Wednesday.  The report by the Government Accountability Office is required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law and deals with one of its most controversial provisions — the Volcker rule.  The Volcker Rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, prohibits banks from trading for their own profit in securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments.  Critics have questioned whether the ban is necessary, saying proprietary trading did not fuel the financial crisis.  They also say an ill-written ban could restrain banks’ market making that is necessary to keep markets liquid.  The GAO report could give fuel to the reform’s critics because it lays out the difficulty of identifying true proprietary trading and also says the practice is not a big money maker for Wall Street.  “Compared to these firms’ overall revenues, their stand-alone proprietary trading generally produced small revenues in most quarters and some larger losses during the financial crisis,” the study said.  The agency focused on the activities at Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.  The report looked at proprietary trading between June 2006 and December 2010.  In 13 quarters during this period, stand-alone proprietary trading produced revenues of $15.6 billion — 3.1 percent or less of the firms’ combined quarterly revenues from all activities. In five quarters during the financial crisis, these firms lost a combined $15.8 billion from the activity.  GAO also said regulators will have a tough time distinguishing proprietary trading.  “While the act’s restrictions reduce the scope of activities regulators must monitor, implementing them poses challenges, including how to best ensure that firms do not take prohibited proprietary positions while conducting their permitted customer-trading activities,” the report said.  Given the sensitivity over the issue, GAO’s conclusions drew a quick rebuke from supporters of the ban, who called the report incomplete and misleading.  “GAO missed this opportunity to help shine more light on the high-risk gambles that decimated millions of families and businesses and nearly destroyed our financial system,” Democratic Senators Carl Levin and Jeff Merkley said in a release.  The GAO, Congress’ non-partisan investigative office, said that it looked only at proprietary trading at desks specifically established to engage in these activities because it was not “feasible” to examine this type of trading elsewhere because of how banks keep their records.  Levin and Merkley said GAO should have looked harder. They said their offices tried to help the agency on how it could examine proprietary trading across banks’ business activities.  “The report reminds us of the story of a man who dropped his keys at night and then began looking for them under a nearby parking lot light, not because he dropped them there but because that was where the light was,” Levin and Merkley said.  Regulators must issue final regulations on the Volcker rule by October. An initial proposal is expected to be released over the summer.

24,WFC,First class-action in U.S. bank overdraft fee case," * Class-action granted vs. Mitsubishi UFJ’s UnionBanCal   * More than two dozen lenders sued over overdraft fees   * Bank of America settled for $410 million   By Jonathan Stempel   NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - A federal judge overseeing nationwide bank overdraft fee litigation granted class-action status to UnionBanCal customers, the first certification in a case targeting more than two dozen lenders, a law firm for the customers said.   Wednesday’s ruling by U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King in Miami means the customers, who could number in the tens of thousands, may sue the parent of Union Bank as a group, which could cut costs and allow higher recoveries.   The judge also threw out a racketeering claim against UnionBanCal, a San Francisco-based unit of Japan’s Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (8306.T), court records show.   Lawyers for UnionBanCal did not immediately return calls seeking a comment. UnionBanCal ended March with $80.6 billion of assets, and operated more than 400 branches in California, Oregon, Washington and Texas.   The overdraft fee litigation consolidates lawsuits filed across the country against JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and other U.S., Canadian and European lenders.   It accuses lenders of routinely processing transactions from largest to smallest rather than in chronological order. This can cause account balances to fall faster, and overdraft fees — typically $25 or $35 — to pile up sooner.   “To the extent the conduct of other banks is similar to that of Union Bank, and we think it is, the certification makes it more likely than not that class-action cases against other banks will also be certified,” said Peter Prieto, a partner at Podhurst Orseck in Miami, whose colleague Aaron Podhurst is co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs.   King in May granted tentative approval to Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) $410 million settlement of similar charges, in a case involving roughly 1 million customers. [ID:nN23249057]   Last year, the Federal Reserve prohibited banks from charging overdraft fees on electronic and debit card transactions without advance customer approval.   Critics say overdraft fees disproportionately burden customers with lower incomes or low account balances.

25,WFC,"Wells, Capital One eye HSBC card portfolio: sources","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) are among the bidders for HSBC Holdings Plc’s (HSBA.L) U.S. credit card portfolio, according to sources familiar with the situation.  In a separate HSBC asset sale, U.S. regional banks First Niagara Financial Group FNFG.O, KeyCorp (KEY.N), and M&T Bank Corp (MTB.N) are among the bidders for the bank’s upstate New York branches, sources said.  The asset sales are part of HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver’s plan to turn around Europe’s largest bank by focusing on its main businesses. HSBC has been criticized for “planting flags” around the world with little consideration to profitability.  The bank said in May it may sell the U.S. credit card unit, which has more than $30 billion in assets.  It also said it would shrink its network of 475 U.S. branches to focus on the international business of U.S. clients and the U.S. business of overseas firms, as well as on a revival in the U.S. manufacturing industry.  Capital One is seen as a strongly motivated bidder for the credit card portfolio, after it agreed to buy ING Group’s ING.AS online U.S. bank for $9 billion, according to sources.  The ING deal is expected to leave Capital One with a surplus of deposits, which the bank could use to fund the HSBC credit card loans.  McLean, Virginia-based Capital One was a credit card company that began acquiring banks in the middle of last decade to secure cheaper deposit funding.  Banks are broadly eager to boost their loan books now to increase profits. Loan demand is relatively weak amid the tepid economy, which has tempted many banks to look at acquisitions.  Credit cards have been performing relatively well in recent years, as banks have scaled back lending to marginal borrowers. Capital One and JPMorgan have recently posted strong second-quarter results in their credit card businesses.  Representatives of Capital One, First Niagara, KeyCorp, M&T, and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo declined to comment.  An HSBC spokesman said its asset review is ongoing, and the bank will communicate key milestones when they occur.  Antitrust matters are a big hurdle for some bidders in the branch sale, because many markets in New York are already dominated by just a few players.  For example, if KeyCorp won HSBC’s branches, it would have about 32 percent of the deposits in and around Albany, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp data.  If M&T won, it would own nearly 42 percent of the metro Rochester market. In and around Buffalo, where M&T is based, the bank would end up with more than 65 percent of the deposits.  “They would own Buffalo at that point. It would be ridiculous. M&T would need to make major divestitures if they won,” said Ken Thomas, a consultant who works with banks looking to buy branches.  But one banker not involved in the deal waved off these concerns, noting that the buyer could sell branches to appease regulators the way PNC Financial Services Group (PNC.N) did when it took over National City. PNC ended up selling some branches to Buffalo-based First Niagara.  M&T could have to shed up to $3 billion of deposits in upstate New York, which is doable, the banker said. The cost savings from the deal could yield significant benefits for the bank, even after divestitures, he added.  Another source said several smaller banks could be buyers for any branches that need to be sold as a result.  The banks involved in the HSBC deal have had many questions about which loans will be combined with the branches, sources said.  HSBC corporate clients whose loans are not sold, and who are therefore staying with HSBC, may not be interested in depositing their money in a branch belonging to another bank, sources said. That could influence how many deposits end up staying with the branches, which have about $15 billion of deposits now.  The loans and deposits included in the deal can have a big impact on any buyers’ profit from the branches.  HSBC, which is being advised by JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) on these sales, initially wanted to find one bidder for the businesses. A single transaction could have been simpler, and the bank thought that a buyer for a large credit card portfolio would also like deposits to fund the assets, a source said.  But the bank got comfortable that the credit card and branches could receive a better price separately than bundled together, sources said. A company like Capital One, for example, is more interested in credit cards, while a bank like First Niagara is more interested in bank branches.  JPMorgan declined to comment.  The credit card portfolio includes private label credit cards, which are issued by large retailers. The HSBC portfolio includes cards from companies like Best Buy Co Inc, (BBY.N) Neiman Marcus Group and Saks Inc SKS.N.  Such deals can get complicated because the retailer often has the right to end the relationship if it doesn’t want to move business to the new company, according to sources.  The next round of bids for the branches are expected around the end of the month or beginning of August, one source said.  It wasn’t clear when the next round of bids were due for the credit card business.

26,WFC,"UPDATE 2-Wells, Capital One eye HSBC card portfolio-sources"," * First Niagara, Key, M&T bid for HSBC upstate NY branches   * Antitrust concerns a hurdle for some bidders on branches   By Dan Wilchins and Paritosh Bansal   NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) are among the bidders for HSBC Holdings Plc’s (HSBA.L) U.S. credit card portfolio, according to sources familiar with the situation.   In a separate HSBC asset sale, U.S. regional banks First Niagara Financial Group FNFG.O, KeyCorp (KEY.N), and M&T Bank Corp (MTB.N) are among the bidders for the bank’s upstate New York branches, sources said.   The asset sales are part of HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver’s plan to turn around Europe’s largest bank by focusing on its main businesses. HSBC has been criticized for “planting flags” around the world with little consideration to profitability.   The bank said in May it may sell the U.S. credit card unit, which has more than $30 billion in assets.   It also said it would shrink its network of 475 U.S. branches to focus on the international business of U.S. clients and the U.S. business of overseas firms, as well as on a revival in the U.S. manufacturing industry. [ID:nH9E7FS004]   Capital One is seen as a strongly motivated bidder for the credit card portfolio, after it agreed to buy ING Groep’s ING.AS online U.S. bank for $9 billion, according to sources.   The ING deal is expected to leave Capital One with a surplus of deposits, which the bank could use to fund the HSBC credit card loans.   McLean, Virginia-based Capital One was a credit card company that began acquiring banks in the middle of last decade to secure cheaper deposit funding.   Banks are broadly eager to boost their loan books now to increase profits. Loan demand is relatively weak amid the tepid economy, which has tempted many banks to look at acquisitions.   Credit cards have been performing relatively well in recent years, as banks have scaled back lending to marginal borrowers. Capital One and JPMorgan have recently posted strong second-quarter results in their credit card businesses.   Representatives of Capital One, First Niagara, KeyCorp, M&T, and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo declined to comment.   An HSBC spokesman said its asset review is ongoing, and the bank will communicate key milestones when they occur.   Antitrust matters are a big hurdle for some bidders in the branch sale, because many markets in New York are already dominated by just a few players.   For example, if KeyCorp won HSBC’s branches, it would have about 32 percent of the deposits in and around Albany, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corp data.   If M&T won, it would own nearly 42 percent of the metro Rochester market. In and around Buffalo, where M&T is based, the bank would end up with more than 65 percent of the deposits.   “They would own Buffalo at that point. It would be ridiculous.

The Securities and Exchange Commission’s move follows Bank of America’s surprise announcement that it would take mortgage-related charges of $20.6 billion in the second quarter, the people told the paper. 	   The total cost was greater than some investors and analysts had expected, the report said.	   The SEC is focusing on whether banks are doing enough to disclose the “reasonably possible” category of losses, the Journal said.	   Officials in the agency’s corporation finance division are reviewing banks’ regular filings to determine whether shareholders have been given fair warning of the mounting future liabilities, the newspaper reported.	   Meredith Cross, director of the SEC’s division of corporation finance, declined to comment to WSJ on disclosures by specific firms.	   However, the SEC recognizes that companies’ estimates of possible losses are not precise and require significant judgment, Cross told the newspaper.

29,WFC,Bank credit demand in municipals zooms higher in Q2,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The use of domestic bank letters of credit for U.S. municipal debt issues jumped nearly 319 percent in the second quarter of 2011 from the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data on Friday.  But the $2.65 billion of new muni debt in 57 deals backed by letters of credit in the first half of the year was down 32.4 percent from the same period in 2010, according to the data.  J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM.N) was the top letter of credit provider so far this year, covering $708 million of debt in 15 deals, followed by Wells Fargo Bank (WFC.N) and Bank of America (BAC.N).  The Thomson Reuters data does not include the replacement of letters of credit on existing debt. About $130 billion of letters of credit and standby bond purchase agreements, representing more than a third of the $380 billion variable-rate demand bond market, expire this year, according to Moody’s Investors Service. In May, the rating agency reported that the expirations and replacement process had gone well in the first quarter.  Rising costs of the facilities and tighter bank credit policies in the wake of the 2008 credit crunch have been a concern for the municipal bond market.  Bond insurance also surged higher in the second quarter from the first quarter, but the $6.4 billion of debt in 542 deals during the first half was 54.5 percent below the same period in 2010, Thomson Reuters reported.  Insured munis, which once made up more than half of the market, have been in a steep drop as insurers lost their top ratings. Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp (AGO.N) remained the only active insurer so far this year, according to the data.  Overall issuance in the muni market is at an 11-year low following 2010’s record supply of $430 billion.  Meanwhile, Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe jumped over last quarter’s leading bond counsel firm Kutak Rock to take over the top spot for the first half of 2011. Orrick was the bond counsel on 157 deals totaling $8.5 billion, followed by Kutak, which handled 76 deals totaling $6.27 billion.

Banks that settled continue filing questionable paperwork: Reuters   * . Reuters identifies 6 robo-signers still pumping out documents    By Scot J. Paltrow	   NEW YORK/IMMOKALEE, Florida, July 18 (Reuters) - America’s leading mortgage lenders vowed in March to end the dubious foreclosure practices that caused a bruising scandal last year.	   But a Reuters investigation finds that many are still taking the same shortcuts they promised to shun, from sketchy paperwork to the use of “robo-signers.”	   In its effort to seize the two-bedroom ranch house of 87-year-old Margery Gunter in this down-on-its-luck Florida town, OneWest Bank recently filed a court document that appears riddled with discrepancies. Mrs. Gunter, who has lived in the house for 40 years and gets around with the aid of a walker, stopped paying her loan back in 2009, her lawyer concedes. To foreclose, the bank submitted to the Collier County clerk’s office on March 3 a “mortgage assignment,” a document essential to proving who owns a mortgage once the original lender sells it off.	   But OneWest’s paperwork is problematic. Among the snags: state law permits lenders to file to foreclose only if they already legally own a mortgage. Yet the key document establishing ownership wasn’t signed and officially recorded until months after OneWest filed to foreclose on Mrs. Gunter. OneWest declined to comment on the case.	   Reuters has found that some of the biggest U.S. banks and other “loan servicers” continue to file questionable foreclosure documents with courts and county clerks. They are using tactics that late last year triggered an outcry, multiple investigations and temporary moratoriums on foreclosures.	   In recent months, servicers have filed thousands of documents that appear to have been fabricated or improperly altered, or have sworn to false facts.	   Reuters also identified at least six “robo-signers,” individuals who in recent months have each signed thousands of mortgage assignments — legal documents which pinpoint ownership of a property. These same individuals have been identified — in depositions, court testimony or court rulings — as previously having signed vast numbers of foreclosure documents that they never read or checked.	   Among them: Christina Carter, an employee of Ocwen Loan Servicing of West Palm Beach, Florida, a “sub-servicer” which handles routine mortgage tasks for banks. Her signature — just two “C”s — has appeared on thousands of mortgage assignments and other documents this year.	   In a case involving a foreclosure by HSBC Bank USA, a New York state court judge this month called Carter a “known robo-signer” and said he’d found multiple variations of her two-letter signature on documents, raising questions about whether others were using her name. That and other red flags prompted the judge to take the extraordinary step of threatening to sanction HSBC’s chief executive officer.	   In a phone interview, Carter acknowledged signing large numbers of mortgage assignments this year, but said they all were legally done. To her knowledge, she added, no one else used her name. 	 	   One of the industry’s top representatives admits that the federal settlements haven’t put a stop to questionable practices.	   Some loan servicers “continue to cut corners,” said David Stevens, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. Nearly all borrowers facing foreclosure are delinquent, he said, but “the real question is whether the servicer complied with all legal requirements.” The loss of a home is “the most critical time in a family’s life,” and if foreclosure paperwork is faulty homeowners should contest it. “Families should be using every opportunity they can to protect their rights.” 	   	   Federal bank regulators signed settlements in March with 14 loan servicers — banks and other companies that perform tasks for mortgage investors such as collecting payments from homeowners and when necessary, filing to foreclose. The 14 firms promised further internal investigations, remediation for some who were harmed and a halt to the filing of false documents. All such behavior had stopped by the end of 2010, they said.	   Of these companies, Reuters has found at least five that in recent months have filed foreclosure documents of questionable validity: OneWest, Bank of America , HSBC Bank USA, Wells Fargo and GMAC Mortgage.

In general, they said their foreclosure cases were legitimate, but for a small number of exceptions, and that criticism by defense lawyers and judges of some types of documentation is based on misinterpretation of the law.	   The persistence of the paperwork mess poses a dilemma for American policymakers and society at large.	   The vast majority of homeowners in foreclosure are in fact delinquent on their mortgage payments. Many bankers and judges view the issue as a technicality. Regardless of legal niceties, they say, people should pay up or lose the collateral on the loans — their houses and condos.	   Increasingly, though, courts are holding that the trusts suing to foreclose don’t actually own the mortgages. Judges have ruled that foreclosing based on flawed or missing evidence violates longstanding laws meant to protect all Americans’ property rights.	   In a landmark decision in January, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court overturned a foreclosure because of a lack of proper documentation.	   “The holder of an assigned mortgage needs to take care to ensure that his legal paperwork is in order,” wrote Justice Robert Cordry in a concurring opinion. “Although there was no apparent actual unfairness here to the (homeowners), that is not the point.

Some state and federal officials have called the settlements weak. Authorities are still working out financial penalties to be imposed on the 14 firms. The banks didn’t admit or deny wrongdoing, and many of the practices banned were previously illegal anyway, such as filing false affidavits and making false notarizations. And regulators left it to the banks to oversee their own internal investigations.  The OCC confirmed it has received complaints that questionable practices continue. But spokesman Bryan Hubbard said the settlements “are intended to address many of the root causes of improper foreclosure actions,” thus preventing future harm.  The collapse of the housing boom in late 2006 led to a wave of foreclosures. Federal Reserve data show that some 4.5 percent of U.S. mortgages are in foreclosure. In 2010, 2.5 million foreclosures were initiated, with a similar number expected this year.  In the housing boom, lenders created millions of new mortgages, packaged them into pools, and securitized them rapidly for sale to investors in so-called mortgage-securities trusts.  The agreements setting up the trusts, called “pooling and servicing agreements,” require that key documents, properly executed and endorsed, be turned over immediately for each mortgage when a trust is established. The two most important ones are a promissory note and mortgage assignment.  A mortgage really has two parts. One is the actual mortgage (in some states called a “deed of trust”). Its purpose is to pledge the home as collateral for the loan. To transfer ownership of this collateral pledge, the seller must issue a document called a mortgage assignment. The other is the promissory note, which is the loan agreement itself. The homeowner signs it, promising to pay principal and interest.  The Reuters examination turned up thousands of instances —more than 2,000 in Florida alone — involving recently filed mortgage assignments which ostensibly transferred mortgages to these trusts years after they were formed.  The problem, according to Georgetown University law professor Adam Levitin, an expert on securitization: About 80 percent of all trust agreements provide that New York State law applies, and under New York law, any mortgage assignments made later than specified in the agreements would be void.  Reuters has also uncovered problems with the other key document used in foreclosure cases, the promissory note.  To foreclose, a trust, bank or mortgage finance giant such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac must possess the original “blue ink” signed promissory note. The crucial parts of the note are at the bottom — the endorsements, somewhat like those on the back of a check. The agreements establishing trusts require a proper chain of endorsements showing legal transfers of a note from the original lender, through any intermediary owners, and finally to the trust itself.  Attorneys defending homeowners contend that improper endorsements are rife. Reuters obtained from public court records and defense attorneys more than 100 examples of notes that for various reasons appear to be improper.  One example: The attempt by Credit Suisse unit DLJ Mortgage Capital to foreclose on Mary Arthur of Dobbs Ferry, New York. Mrs. Arthur, 63 and legally blind, works part time as an assistant in a doctor’s office. Originally from Trinidad, Mrs. Arthur became delinquent on her $427,500 loan after her parents and sister died and she ran up debts traveling home for the funerals, according to her attorney, Linda Tirelli.  The loan servicers, Select Portfolio Servicing of Salt Lake City, threatened to foreclose on DLJ’s behalf. Mrs. Arthur arranged with Select Portfolio a trial mortgage modification to see if she could keep up with the reduced payments. She made the payments but, Tirelli said, Select Portfolio filed to foreclose.  DLJ filed in two separate court cases what it said were authentic copies of Mrs. Arthur’s promissory note. Because they were supposed to be copies of the same document, the endorsements filed with both courts should be identical.  But a look at the documents shows that the version filed in state court and the one filed in bankruptcy court had completely different endorsements on them — naming different owner banks and signed by different people. Tirelli said she has brought this to the attention of the bankruptcy judge and is awaiting a ruling.  Credit Suisse, which owns both DLJ Mortgage Capital and Select Portfolio Servicing, declined to comment, as did Casey Howard, the lawyer representing DLJ in the bankruptcy case.  Bank of America, meanwhile, is coming under fire from a New York federal bankruptcy judge.  Last Tuesday, Judge Robert Drain ordered an investigation involving a foreclosure case brought by the bank. Two earlier copies of a promissory note filed in court had lacked any endorsement, but then one appeared on the note when bank lawyers produced the original.  The judge said the sudden appearance of an endorsement, and his own close look at it, raised questions about whether it had been added illegally to make the note look legitimate.  It “raises a sufficiently serious issue as to when and more importantly by whom this note was endorsed,” the judge said.  A Bank of America spokesman said the bank will produce evidence that “will demonstrate to the court’s satisfaction that the endorsement is proper.”  (In re: Priscilla C. Taylor, Debtor, United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, Case # 10-22652.)  These banks aren’t alone in filing doubtful documents. Reuters found cases in which Wells Fargo didn’t obtain mortgage assignments — and hence the right to foreclose — until well after it had filed foreclosure cases.  Wells Fargo, as a trustee, has moved to foreclose on homeowners who have mortgages from now-defunct Option One Mortgage Corp. In June, a bankruptcy appellate panel of the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a decision to allow Wells Fargo to foreclose on an Option One mortgage. It said that there was no evidence that the note and mortgage had ever been turned over to Wells Fargo as trustee.  In court files of Florida foreclosure cases by Wells Fargo on Option One mortgages, none of the promissory notes filed as exhibits in 10 cases found by Reuters had any endorsements on them.  A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said it is possible that proper endorsements exist but were omitted from the copies of the promissory notes filed in court.  In other cases reviewed by Reuters, Wells Fargo and GMAC Mortgage, a unit of Ally Financial, this year assigned mortgages from defunct lender New Century Mortgage Corp., which went under in 2007. Securitization lawyers say it is technically impossible for a defunct company to directly assign a mortgage over to another owner.  Documents and statements made to courts that are found to be false can amount to crimes under state and federal laws. Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and former federal prosecutor, said such acts can be perjury, and preparing fraudulent documents can be prosecuted under federal mail and wire fraud statutes. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act makes it a crime punishable by up to 20 years in jail to file false documents in a bankruptcy case, including foreclosures.  ROBO-SIGNERS RETURN  Reuters also found that loan servicers are still using the corner-cutting tactic that most captured the public imagination last year: robo-signing.  The investigation identified six known robo-signers who have continued to churn out large numbers of mortgage assignments since the beginning of 2011 - months after the industry vowed to stop the practice.  Among them is Bryan Bly, an employee of Nationwide Title Clearing of Palm Harbor, Florida.  Bly testified in a July 2010 foreclosure case in Florida that he signed up to 5,000 mortgage assignments per day at the loan-servicing company. Although he is an employee of Nationwide, he signed the documents as a “vice president” of Option One Mortgage, Deutsche Bank, CitiBank and other institutions. (Case # 2009-CA-1920, Circuit Court of the Fourth Judicial District, Clay County, FL)  In his deposition, Bly said Nationwide multiplied his output by electronically stamping his signature on additional mortgage assignments that Bly said he never saw. He testified, too, that all the documents then were falsely notarized. Nationwide’s notaries were given stacks of the already-signed documents, he said, and attested falsely that Bly had signed the legal papers in front of them. Bly said he didn’t verify the information in the papers he signed, and that he didn’t understand key words and expressions in them.  Despite these disclosures, a Reuters search of county clerk records in Florida, New York and Massachusetts shows that Bly continued to sign thousands of mortgage assignments this year.  A Nationwide spokeswoman said there is nothing illegal about signing large numbers of mortgage assignments. After Reuters inquired about Bly, however, she later said that because of recent questions raised about him by Nationwide customers, Bly has been moved to a job at the firm that doesn’t involve signing documents.  R. Christopher Rodems, a lawyer for Bly, said there is nothing improper about signing large numbers of mortgage assignments. Rodems said Bly had received death threats after a videotaped deposition Bly gave in November 2010 was posted briefly on YouTube, in which he testified about signing massive numbers of mortgage assignments.  Robo-signing isn’t limited to low-level employees at loan servicers.  Lawrence Buckley is a lawyer who manages the Dallas, Texas law firm Brice, Vander Linden and Wernick. In March, he testified that he had allowed his electronic signature to be affixed to sworn court documents that he had never seen. The documents, known as “proofs of claim,” included one filed with the federal bankruptcy court in New York. It sought permission for Deutsche Bank to seize the Bronx, New York, house of 59-year-old Virginia Obasi. (United States Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, Case # 10-10494 MG)  Buckley said he had never seen the document, and that another lawyer at his firm had filed it using Buckley’s electronic signature. The signature appears on the document as “/s/ Lawrence J. Buckley.”  Buckley said that other lawyers at his firm were permitted to use his signature to file documents electronically with bankruptcy courts. He testified that it was standard practice at the firm not to review any of the original documents the claim was supposed to be based on, such as the original promissory note and mortgage.  Luke Madole, a lawyer for Buckley, said he saw nothing wrong with Buckley letting lawyers he directly managed use his electronic signature. Later, in an e-mailed statement, Madole added that what occurred “is nothing like ‘robo-signing’” and to use “that loaded term would be unfair in the extreme.”  Robo-signer Christina Carter resurfaced in a ruling earlier this month, when Arthur Schack, a New York State court judge in Brooklyn, threw out an attempt by HSBC to foreclose on a Brooklyn house.  Schack said he had instructed HSBC’s chief lawyer in the case, Frank Cassara, to confirm key facts directly with HSBC officials. The judge said Cassara subsequently “affirmed ‘under the penalties of perjury’” that he had done so. But the judge said it turned out that Cassara had never checked with anyone at HSBC, and that the employees Cassara had said he spoke with at HSBC actually worked for a loan servicer.  The judge also said signatures on documents in the case were filed by known robo-signers, three of whom he identified by name, including Carter of Ocwen Loan Servicing. He personally had examined multiple examples of their signatures, the judge said, and found wide variations, raising the possibility that other people had been signing their names.  Judge Schack then took an unusual step: He formally threatened HSBC’s CEO, Irene Dorner, as well as lawyers for the firm, with sanctions for relying on known robo-signers, filing false documents and making false representations to the court. The possible sanctions could range from an oral reprimand to financial and other penalties.  “If HSBC has a duty to make money for its stockholders,” Schack wrote, “why is it purchasing nonperforming loans, and wasting the Court’s time with defective paperwork and the use of robo-signers?” [ID:nN1E76612C]  HSBC spokesman Neil Brazil said that the servicer, Ocwen, was responsible for what occurred in the case, and that HSBC had had no role in it.  Paul Koches, Ocwen’s general counsel, said in an e-mail: “To our knowledge, there was nothing submitted by our legal counsel to the court that was in any way misleading as to who is the owner of this mortgage and note, nor was there any conduct of any kind that would justify sanctions.”  Carter says she did nothing improper, and left Ocwen voluntarily in May for another job.  The bank now trying to foreclose on Marjorie Gunter has produced a troubled paper trail. OneWest submitted a document signed this February to prove that the original lender for her mortgage, a company called MortgageIT, had signed over ownership to OneWest. But MortgageIT, owned by Deutsche Bank, wasn’t in business in February. It had ceased operations three years earlier, in 2008.  A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment.  Even if the February document were authentic, it wasn’t recorded until nearly 10 months after OneWest had launched its foreclosure action, which began in May 2010. Real estate law throughout the United States requires that before moving to foreclose, a trust or bank must already own the mortgage and related promissory note. Otherwise, courts have ruled, a forecloser has no right to seize a house.  OneWest also filed two separate copies of what it said was the 87-year-old homeowner’s original promissory note. The first had an endorsement only from MortgageIT to now-defunct IndyMac Bank. Weeks later, OneWest filed a second copy of the note, with the addition of a “blank” endorsement — an endorsement by IndyMac, but with the name of the payee left empty. OneWest has filed no evidence in the case that the note was subsequently transferred to Fannie Mae.  OneWest declined to explain the multiple apparent discrepancies in the Gunter foreclosure documents. A spokesman said in an e-mail: “OneWest is dedicated to ensuring that it meets the needs of its customers, acts in accordance with applicable laws, and complies with its contractual mortgage servicing duties to the highest standards.”  A Fannie Mae spokeswoman said Fannie does own the Gunter note, but declined to explain how the mortgage finance giant obtained it, “due to it being in active litigation.”  The judge in the Gunter case hasn’t ruled yet on OneWest’s documents. (20th Judicial Circuit Court in Collier County, FL, Case number 10-2982-CA).  Mrs. Gunter lives in Immokalee, a scrubby town 34 miles inland from Fort Myers on Florida’s Gulf coast. About 40 per cent of the townspeople live below the poverty line, census data show. She shares her home with her three dogs; her one surviving son lives in a nursing home.  In an interview at her house, on a dusty road off the main highway, Mrs. Gunter said she doesn’t understand why the bank is foreclosing.  OneWest says that Mrs. Gunter now is delinquent by more than $160,000. Her lawyer, Joseph Klein of the Legal Aid Service of Collier County, argues there are extenuating circumstances.  Copies of her mortgage application forms show that in December 2006, an agent for Deutsche Bank’s MortgageIT unit signed up Mrs. Gunter for a $149,900 mortgage. The forms, listing her income, show that the agent knew that the monthly payments — $1,151, including insurance — were more than her monthly income of $800 from Social Security plus about $200 in food stamps.  In an affidavit filed in court, Mrs. Gunter said she had asked the salesman for a “reverse mortgage,” which allows senior citizens to remain in their homes without making mortgage payments, with the value of the house going to the bank when they die. But the documents the salesman gave her to sign were for an ordinary 30-year mortgage.  Losing her place would be a devastating blow, Mrs. Gunter said. “If they take the house,” she said, “they’ll take me, too.”  ",7182011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-foreclosure-banks/special-report-banks-continue-robo-signing-idUSTRE76H5XX20110718
35,WFC,Analysis: Wall St to learn if Dodd-Frank bark worse than bite,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wall Street will soon get an idea of just how far the regulatory pendulum will swing.  A year after passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, policymakers have yet to detail many of the rules that will determine if high-flying Wall Street giants become heavily regulated and marginally profitable financial utilities, or if they’ll simply get their wings clipped.  In the next few months, three reforms linked to profits will come into focus: capital and liquidity standards, the Volcker limits on proprietary trading, and whether banks will have to restructure to make it easier for regulators to break them up.  “The very bank-specific stuff is coming at us... what kind of business are banks going to be allowed to be in, what will the business of banking be going forward,” said Wayne Abernathy, a top official at the American Bankers Association.  The Federal Reserve, as early as this month, is set to issue a proposal on what new, tougher capital and liquidity requirements large U.S. banks will have to meet.  Liquidity reforms, in particular, have so far been vague at best. They are important to Wall Street because the most liquid assets can be the some of the least profitable.  The global group of Basel negotiators have yet to tackle the issue and bankers are eager to see whether the Fed will jump ahead with a concrete proposal this summer, or wait for those negotiations to catch up to the Dodd-Frank timeline.  “I haven’t seen anything and it’s kind of disheartening,” said Christopher Mutascio, a bank analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. “We’re still focused on capital and we’re not looking at the left hand which is liquidity, and I think they should go hand in hand.”  Banks are already squawking at tougher capital rules agreed to by global regulators, saying they will force banks to sit on assets instead of seeking a return on them.  The Basel III agreement will require banks to hold top-quality capital equal to 7 percent of their risk-bearing assets, more than triple current standards.  On top of that, global “systemic” banks — a group expected to include JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo — may have to hold up to an additional 2.5 percent buffer. Another 1 percent surcharge would be imposed if a bank becomes significantly bigger.  “God knows why we have to hold all that capital, but that’s where we are,” JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said during last week’s earnings call.  The Fed has to decide whether be stricter than the Basel accord — a worst-case scenario for banks — under the power given to it by Dodd-Frank to ensure banks are less susceptible to financial shocks.  That stricter scenario looked like a real possibility after Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo floated some provocative capital ideas in early June.  But it has become more remote since the United States got much of what it wanted out of late June’s international capital negotiations.  Regardless, the tougher standards will require banks to fund themselves more with equity and less with debt.  Even if the Fed rule largely mirrors what was agreed to in the Basel pact, banks are worried they will have a harder time attracting investors because they will have to keep more equity on their books rather than return it to shareholders.  “From a shareholder’s perspective that is going to have the biggest impact on the profitability, the return on equity for these banks,” said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.  Clarity on these capital requirements could trigger big changes on Wall Street. A July 13 research note from Nomura said that banks may shift resources into lines of business that can provide more of a return on capital, such as asset management, traditional investment banking, and emerging market consumer banking.  Several other key aspects of the law will be revealed in the coming months, including the Volcker rule.  The Volcker rule, named after former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, bans banks from trading for their own profit in securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments.  An initial proposal is expected this summer with a final rule due by October.  Banks such as Goldman Sachs have already shut down their stand-alone proprietary trading desks since the law was enacted, but regulators have yet to define what trading is still permissible.  The key question is what will define trades that are intended to make a market for a client, a revenue-rich business that banks are not eager to see curtailed.  “Banking organizations need to know, particularly in the litigious U.S. environment, where the line is between legal and illegal activity,” Hal Scott, a Harvard law professor specializing in international financial systems, told a recent congressional hearing.  Financial regulators are also packing a wild-card weapon that gives them the ability to break up Wall Street banks.  Regulators expect to issue a final rule this summer on how banks should draft “living wills” providing regulators with a roadmap for how to break them up if they begin to falter.  If regulators deem the living wills unacceptable, they could force them to reorganize business lines, form foreign subsidiaries, or even downsize so they are easier to liquidate.  Former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair aggressively made the case that regulators should force these changes if they are not made voluntarily.  But Bair left her post earlier this month, leaving open the question of whether Federal Reserve officials and her replacement at the FDIC will aggressively pursue this tactic.

36,WFC,Factbox: Most influential U.S. financial watchdogs,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new field of top financial policymakers is emerging in Washington.  There has been significant turnover as the United States approaches the anniversary of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank financial oversight law, a response to the worst financial crisis in generations and a severe recession.  A few of the most influential players, such as former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair, have recently left, and the new crop of nominated regulators may face tough Senate confirmation battles.  Below is a list of the most powerful people carrying out the revamp of how financial markets and firms are regulated.  —Timothy Geithner, Treasury secretary: Geithner has been the Obama administration’s domestic and international salesman for Dodd-Frank. A former president of the New York Federal Reserve, Geithner is viewed as more sympathetic to Wall Street than some of his regulatory colleagues. He holds a powerful post as head of the U.S. systemic risk council, responsible for drafting the Volcker rule and picking “systemic” firms. Going forward, Geithner or his successor will face the challenge of trying to harmonize U.S. regulations and international reforms in a way that keeps U.S. markets both competitive and closely regulated.  —Daniel Tarullo, Federal Reserve governor: On the Fed board, Tarullo is the point person for financial regulation. He was a law professor at Harvard and Georgetown University, and often gives long-winded, academic speeches on bank capital, supervision and “too big to fail.” He was one of the first high-level U.S. regulators to say excessive Wall Street pay played a role in the financial crisis, and he spooked markets recently by suggesting big U.S. banks could be held to capital levels sharply higher than the Basel III agreement. President Barack Obama has not yet nominated a Fed vice chairman for supervision, but Tarullo is considered a frontrunner.  —Mary Schapiro, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission: Schapiro has led the agency with a no-nonsense attitude since being appointed in January 2009. She has a long history as a regulator, having served at both FINRA and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. She was brought into the chairmanship as a change agent for the SEC, which was reeling from having missed Bernard Madoff’s epic Ponzi scheme and from loosely regulating U.S. investment banks leading up to the financial crisis. Some of her biggest challenges ahead will be revamping market structure in the wake of the May 2010 flash crash, creating a regulatory framework for security-based derivatives, and proving the SEC is a tough watchdog.  Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission: An 18-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, Gensler came to the CFTC with Wall Street credibility. His first two years as CFTC chairman, however, have shown him to be more of a tough-nosed regulator than an ally of the financial industry. He has fought for narrow exemptions to capital, margin and clearing requirements for the $600 trillion global swaps market. He has also been an outspoken supporter of controversial new position limits in commodity markets. His mettle will be tested as he leads the CFTC’s work in finalizing derivatives regulations among cries they will harm U.S. companies and capital markets.  Richard Cordray, nominee to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — The former Ohio attorney general is a new face on the Washington regulation scene. Obama this week picked Cordray to head the new agency, sidestepping some of the controversy he would have faced had he nominated Elizabeth Warren. Cordray, however, is also a critic of the bank industry and as Ohio AG frequently led other states in suing financial firms for misdeeds. If confirmed, Cordray will have to prove he can protect consumers from misleading mortgages and excessive credit card fees without being distracted by an antagonistic relationship with the financial industry.  Martin Gruenberg, nominee for Federal Deposit Insurance Corp chairman: The acting head of the FDIC has big shoes to fill, after Bair left at the end of her five-year term in early July. Unlike Bair, Gruenberg has a low-key public manner. But colleagues warn not to mistake his muted style for a lack of strong beliefs, which include a firm approach to reining in risky bank practices. Those beliefs will be on display as the FDIC finalizes its “orderly liquidation authority,” and tries to convince markets the government can and will dismantle a toppling financial giant. He will also be a critical voice in the debate over U.S. capital reforms.  Thomas Curry, nominee for Comptroller of the Currency: Curry, an FDIC board member, is another Bair ally who worked behind the scenes. He is a registered independent and would be expected to shift the perception that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is a friendly regulator to the nation’s largest banks.  Richard Shelby, ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee: Shelby has been a staunch opponent of many pieces of the Dodd-Frank law, saying it is a regulatory overreach that could restrict lending and strangle the economic recovery. He successfully batted down Obama’s nomination of Peter Diamond as a Fed governor, and could be a major obstacle to Obama’s financial policymaker nominees.  Barney Frank, ranking Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee: As a namesake of the Dodd-Frank financial oversight law, Frank’s opinions will hold sway as regulators write rules to carry out the legislation’s intent and as lobbyists try to derail it. Frank already caused a buzz when he argued the Fed went too far in cracking down on debit card swipe fees. His other assessments will be just as closely watched.

37,WFC,"Factbox: U.S. regulators crack down on banks, markets","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are straining to keep pace as they write more than 200 rules to rein in risk-taking throughout the financial system.  A year after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank financial oversight law, regulatory agencies have finalized only a handful of reforms but are expected to pick up the pace during the second half of the year.  In the meantime, lobbyists and Wall Street executives, as part of their efforts to delay and scale back reforms, are raising pointed questions about whether Dodd-Frank will hamstring the economic recovery.  A broad rollback of reforms is not expected, at least in the near-term.  Here is a look at some key regulatory reform areas:  The new global Basel III pact, approved by the G20 last year, is forcing big banks to thicken their capital cushions, with U.S. banks generally further along than their non-U.S. rivals.  In June, Basel negotiators released a plan requiring global “systemic” banks — a group expected to include JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co — to hold up to an additional 2.5 percent buffer. Another 1 percent surcharge would be imposed if a bank becomes significantly bigger.  That would come on top of the minimum 7 percent risk-based capital requirement for all banks.  U.S. regulators are expected to start writing rules in the next few months, largely in line with the Basel agreement.  Dodd-Frank does not explicitly cap bank pay. Instead, it tries to remove financial incentives for bankers to take big risks that prioritize short-term profits regardless of those bets’ long-term performance.  The law requires regulators to regularly review financial firms and prohibit any pay practice that “encourages inappropriate risks.”  Beyond that, U.S. regulators proposed that executives at the largest financial institutions, such as Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, have half of their bonuses deferred for at least three years.  The reform lines up with a G20 agreement. The European Union has gone further, setting in law specific limits for cash elements of compensation.  Only the United States has a solid new government process — other than bankruptcy or more bailouts — for dealing with large financial firms in distress.  Known as orderly liquidation, it was part of the Dodd-Frank reforms. Critics say it won’t work, while proponents argue it is a viable strategy for ending the problem of “too big to fail.”  U.S. regulators are still finalizing a related rule on tagging some large firms as “systemic risks” to stability and subject to tougher oversight under Dodd-Frank. Insurers, mutual funds and hedge funds are trying to dodge the label, which will not officially be applied until later this year at the earliest.  The G20 has only recommendations in this area and hopes to approve some measures by the end of 2011, which could be introduced over several years. The EU has outlined plans and will propose a draft law later this year.  A worldwide push is under way to redirect much of the over-the-counter market for derivatives through exchanges and central clearinghouses, with stronger capital buffers.  The G20 wants standardized contracts trading on exchanges or electronic platforms and centrally cleared by the end of 2012. The EU has a draft law to implement the G20 pledges.  Reforms along these lines are being implemented by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has first drafts of all the major rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission has created parallel reforms for security-based derivatives.  Delays and congressional threats to throttle the agencies’ funding have slowed their work. The CFTC currently expects to finalize most of its rules before 2012.  The Volcker rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, bans banks from trading for their own profit in securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments.

DERIVATIVES  A worldwide push is under way to redirect much of the over-the-counter market for derivatives through exchanges and central clearinghouses, with stronger capital buffers.  The G20 wants standardized contracts trading on exchanges or electronic platforms and centrally cleared by the end of 2012. The EU has a draft law to implement the G20 pledges.  Reforms along these lines are being implemented by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has first drafts of all the major rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission has created parallel reforms for security-based derivatives.  Delays and congressional threats to throttle the agencies’ funding have slowed their work. The CFTC currently expects to finalize most of its rules before 2012.  VOLCKER RULE  The Volcker rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, bans banks from trading for their own profit in securities, derivatives and certain other financial instruments.  An initial proposal is expected this summer, with a final rule due by October. Banks such as Goldman Sachs have already shut down their stand-alone proprietary trading desks since Dodd-Frank was enacted, but regulators have yet to define what trading is still permissible.  The key question is what will define trades that are intended to make a market for a client, a revenue-rich business that banks are not eager to see curtailed.  Foreign regulators have not introduced a similar crackdown, raising concerns that U.S. firms will be put at a competitive disadvantage.

Quarterly numbers from technology bellwether International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Coca-Cola (KO.N) lifted technology and consumer shares in the first heavy week of second-quarter results. IBM gained 5.7 percent, leading the Dow’s gainers.  The Nasdaq gained more than 2 percent, led by big-cap tech, including Apple (AAPL.O), which hit a 52-week high during regular trading. After the market closed, the maker of iPhones and iPads reported revenue well above analysts’ estimates, sending its shares up 6.7 percent to $402.  Nasdaq 100 index futures rose 22 points, indicating a higher open for stocks on Wednesday.  “The market has been looking for leadership and it hasn’t been getting it from finanicals... The fact that tech companies can deliver or exceed results gives markets hope that stocks can rise, even given broader macro concerns,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group.  In Tuesday’s session, the S&P information technology sector .GSPT was the best performing sector, gaining 2.7 percent.  Markets gained momentum late in the day after President Barack Obama suggested progress was being made toward a $3.75 trillion deficit reduction deal centered around entitlement reform.  The White House and Congress also need to sign an agreement that includes an increase in the federal debt ceiling by August 2 or the United States could default on its debt.  “Stocks are starting to bounce at least for the time being, with people wagering that there will be a resolution on the debt ceiling,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at John Thomas Financial in New York.

After advancing in the morning, Bank of America (BAC.N) shares fell 1.5 percent to $9.57, while Goldman declined 0.6 percent to $128.49.  Wells Fargo (WFC.N) shares jumped 5.7 percent, the biggest gain on the S&P financials index, after the bank said its profit rose 30 percent.  “In terms of the overall earnings season, I’d say things have been pretty good so far,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors.

41,WFC,"UPDATE 5-Wells Fargo beats estimates, outlines cost cuts"," * Lender says cost cuts will save $6 billion a year   * Q2 EPS 70 cents vs Street view 68 cents   * Loss reserves reduced by $1 billion   * Shares up 6 percent   * Doubts appear in options market  (Includes closing share price and bearish option trading)   By David Henry   NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) posted 30 percent increase in second quarter profits, beating analyst expectations as it cut costs and dipped into funds previously set aside to cover losses.   The bank said it could save as much as $6 billion a year from cutting costs, the first time Wells Fargo disclosed the potential extent of its cost reduction plans. The bank generated about $50 billion of non-interest expenses over the last four quarters.   Wells Fargo’s lending margins shrank less than many of its peers and it made more loans to businesses during the quarter. The bank’s credit losses declined, and it drew down $1 billion it had set aside for bad loans, the fifth consecutive quarter of its reducing its loan loss reserves.   In New York, Wells Fargo’s shares rose $1.53, nearly 6 percent, to close at $28.41. However, in the stock options market a surge in buying puts, which pay off if the shares fall, suggested some strategists were betting Wells could get hit later on, said Caitlin Duffy, an analyst at Interactive Brokers Group.   The bank posted second-quarter net income for common shareholders of $3.73 billion, up from $2.88 billion a year earlier.   Earnings per share rose to 70 cents from 55 cents. Analysts, on average, expected 68 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Net loan charge-offs declined to $2.84 billion from $3.21 billion in the first quarter and $4.49 billion in the year-ago second quarter.   In a conference call following the report, Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said the company’s cost-cutting campaign, which it started a year ago, will reduce non-interest expenses by about 12 percent, or $1.5 billion per quarter, by the end of 2012. At that rate, the company will save $6 billion annually, which would be worth about $4 billion after-tax and add 75 cents per share of earnings to Wells’ 5.3 billion shares.   Sloan said in an interview with Reuters this was the first time the company provided investors with an estimate of the cost savings from “Project Compass” initiative.   “We think our opportunities to operate more cost effectively are just as promising as the growth opportunities that we believe lie ahead of us,” Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf said in the conference call.   The expense cutting contributed to the stock move, along with the fact the shares were down for several days going into the report, said Gary Townsend, president of money manager Hill-Townsend Capital.   “These kinds of cost-cutting initiatives are typically well-received,” said Townsend, adding they are also critical because of slack loan demand and government requirements that banks hold more capital.   Wells executives said they are seeing some increase in demand for loans from business. The bank’s book of loans to businesses grew to $330.7 billion at the end of June, up 2.3 percent from three months earlier. Loans to consumers shrank 1.6 percent at the same time, leaving Wells’ loan portfolio flat.   “While the economic recovery continues to be slower than expected, there are signs that businesses are investing for growth,” Stumpf said in the company’s earnings release.   Bank of America posted second quarter results that were ravaged by a mortgage settlement and other home-loan charges, but Wells Fargo did not post out-sized mortgage charges.   The executives on the bank’s conference call said its mortgage portfolios are relatively healthy and the bank recorded a lot of charges at the time of its acquisition of lender Wachovia in 2008.   William Larkin, fixed income portfolio manager at Salem, Massachusetts-based Cabot Money Management, said the news was “another positive” that suggests U.S. housing might be turning the corner.   Wells Fargo Chief Risk Officer Mike Loughlin said in the earnings release the improving credit quality marked the bank’s sixth consecutive quarter of declining loan losses and the third consecutive quarter of lower nonperforming assets.   Mortgage originations at Wells Fargo bank — which was the market leader in new loans on homes in the first quarter, according to newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance — fell to $64 billion in the second quarter, down 24 percent from the first quarter. Sloan told Reuters the decline was in line with a general slowdown in mortgage borrowing after a surge in refinancing in the last half of 2010.

Paltrow	   NEW YORK/IMMOKALEE, Florida, July 19(Reuters) - America’s leading mortgage lenders vowed in March to end the dubious foreclosure practices that caused a bruising scandal last year.	   But a Reuters investigation finds that many are still taking the same shortcuts they promised to shun, from sketchy paperwork to the use of “robo-signers.”	   In its effort to seize the two-bedroom ranch house of 87-year-old Margery Gunter in this down-on-its-luck Florida town, OneWest Bank recently filed a court document that appears riddled with discrepancies. Mrs. Gunter, who has lived in the house for 40 years and gets around with the aid of a walker, stopped paying her loan back in 2009, her lawyer concedes. To foreclose, the bank submitted to the Collier County clerk’s office on March 3 a “mortgage assignment,” a document essential to proving who owns a mortgage once the original lender sells it off.	   But OneWest’s paperwork is problematic. Among the snags: state law permits lenders to file to foreclose only if they already legally own a mortgage. Yet the key document establishing ownership wasn’t signed and officially recorded until months after OneWest filed to foreclose on Mrs. Gunter. OneWest declined to comment on the case.	   Reuters has found that some of the biggest U.S. banks and other “loan servicers” continue to file questionable foreclosure documents with courts and county clerks. They are using tactics that late last year triggered an outcry, multiple investigations and temporary moratoriums on foreclosures.	   In recent months, servicers have filed thousands of documents that appear to have been fabricated or improperly altered, or have sworn to false facts.	   Reuters also identified at least six “robo-signers,” individuals who in recent months have each signed thousands of mortgage assignments — legal documents which pinpoint ownership of a property. These same individuals have been identified — in depositions, court testimony or court rulings — as previously having signed vast numbers of foreclosure documents that they never read or checked.	   Among them: Christina Carter, an employee of Ocwen Loan Servicing of West Palm Beach, Florida, a “sub-servicer” which handles routine mortgage tasks for banks. Her signature — just two “C”s — has appeared on thousands of mortgage assignments and other documents this year.	   In a case involving a foreclosure by HSBC Bank USA, a New York state court judge this month called Carter a “known robo-signer” and said he’d found multiple variations of her two-letter signature on documents, raising questions about whether others were using her name. That and other red flags prompted the judge to take the extraordinary step of threatening to sanction HSBC’s chief executive officer.	   In a phone interview, Carter acknowledged signing large numbers of mortgage assignments this year, but said they all were legally done. To her knowledge, she added, no one else used her name. 	 	   One of the industry ‘s top representatives says it is possible that the federal settlements haven’t put a stop to questionable practices. “My judgment is that robo-signing had essentially gone away,” said David Stevens, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. “It doesn’t mean that there aren’t other ways to continue to cut corners, or mistakes occurring with select servicers.”	  Nearly all borrowers facing foreclosure are delinquent, Stevens added, but “the real question is whether the servicer complied with all legal requirements.” The loss of a home is “the most critical time in a family’s life,” and if foreclosure paperwork is faulty homeowners should contest it. “Families should be using every opportunity they can to protect their rights.”	   	   Federal bank regulators signed settlements in March with 14 loan servicers — banks and other companies that perform tasks for mortgage investors such as collecting payments from homeowners and when necessary, filing to foreclose. The 14 firms promised further internal investigations, remediation for some who were harmed and a halt to the filing of false documents. All such behavior had stopped by the end of 2010, they said.	   Of these companies, Reuters has found at least five that in recent months have filed foreclosure documents of questionable validity: OneWest, Bank of America , HSBC Bank USA, Wells Fargo and GMAC Mortgage.	   So have half a dozen large servicers that weren’t party to the agreements, including Ocwen Financial Corp and units of Credit Suisse Group AG .	   Spokesmen for the banks and servicers named in this article said that they halted any wrongdoing after disclosures last autumn of robo-signing led them to revise their practices, and they denied filing false documents since then.	   In general, they said their foreclosure cases were legitimate, but for a small number of exceptions, and that criticism by defense lawyers and judges of some types of documentation is based on misinterpretation of the law.	   The persistence of the paperwork mess poses a dilemma for American policymakers and society at large.	   The vast majority of homeowners in foreclosure are in fact delinquent on their mortgage payments. Many bankers and judges view the issue as a technicality. Regardless of legal niceties, they say, people should pay up or lose the collateral on the loans — their houses and condos.	   Increasingly, though, courts are holding that the trusts suing to foreclose don’t actually own the mortgages. Judges have ruled that foreclosing based on flawed or missing evidence violates longstanding laws meant to protect all Americans’ property rights.	   In a landmark decision in January, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court overturned a foreclosure because of a lack of proper documentation.	   “The holder of an assigned mortgage needs to take care to ensure that his legal paperwork is in order,” wrote Justice Robert Cordry in a concurring opinion. “Although there was no apparent actual unfairness here to the (homeowners), that is not the point. Foreclosure is a powerful act with significant consequences, and Massachusetts law has always required that it proceed strictly in accord with the statutes that govern it.” 	  (U.S. Bank National Association, trustee, vs. Antonio Ibanez, 458 Mass. 637.)	   Reuters reviewed records of individual county clerk offices in five states — Florida, Massachusetts, New York, and North and South Carolina — with searchable online databases. Reuters also examined hundreds of documents from court case files, some obtained online and others provided by attorneys.	   The searches found more than 1,000 mortgage assignments that for multiple reasons appear questionable: promissory notes missing required endorsements or bearing faulty ones; and “complaints” (the legal documents that launch foreclosure suits) that appear to contain multiple incorrect facts.	   These are practices that the 14 banks and other loan servicers said had occurred only on a small scale and were halted more than six months ago.	   The settlements included the four largest banks in the United States — Bank of America Corp, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase & Co , and Citigroup Inc . The other parties were lending units of Ally Financial Inc , HSBC Holdings PLC , MetLife Inc , PNC Financial Services Group Inc , SunTrust Banks Inc , U.S. Bancorp, Aurora Bank, EverBank Ever.N, OneWest Bank and Sovereign Bank.

In general, they said their foreclosure cases were legitimate, but for a small number of exceptions, and that criticism by defense lawyers and judges of some types of documentation is based on misinterpretation of the law.	   The persistence of the paperwork mess poses a dilemma for American policymakers and society at large.	   The vast majority of homeowners in foreclosure are in fact delinquent on their mortgage payments. Many bankers and judges view the issue as a technicality. Regardless of legal niceties, they say, people should pay up or lose the collateral on the loans — their houses and condos.	   Increasingly, though, courts are holding that the trusts suing to foreclose don’t actually own the mortgages. Judges have ruled that foreclosing based on flawed or missing evidence violates longstanding laws meant to protect all Americans’ property rights.	   In a landmark decision in January, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court overturned a foreclosure because of a lack of proper documentation.	   “The holder of an assigned mortgage needs to take care to ensure that his legal paperwork is in order,” wrote Justice Robert Cordry in a concurring opinion. “Although there was no apparent actual unfairness here to the (homeowners), that is not the point. Foreclosure is a powerful act with significant consequences, and Massachusetts law has always required that it proceed strictly in accord with the statutes that govern it.” 	  (U.S. Bank National Association, trustee, vs. Antonio Ibanez, 458 Mass. 637.)	   Reuters reviewed records of individual county clerk offices in five states — Florida, Massachusetts, New York, and North and South Carolina — with searchable online databases. Reuters also examined hundreds of documents from court case files, some obtained online and others provided by attorneys.	   The searches found more than 1,000 mortgage assignments that for multiple reasons appear questionable: promissory notes missing required endorsements or bearing faulty ones; and “complaints” (the legal documents that launch foreclosure suits) that appear to contain multiple incorrect facts.	   These are practices that the 14 banks and other loan servicers said had occurred only on a small scale and were halted more than six months ago.	   The settlements included the four largest banks in the United States — Bank of America Corp, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase & Co , and Citigroup Inc . The other parties were lending units of Ally Financial Inc , HSBC Holdings PLC , MetLife Inc , PNC Financial Services Group Inc , SunTrust Banks Inc , U.S. Bancorp, Aurora Bank, EverBank Ever.N, OneWest Bank and Sovereign Bank.	   The pacts were struck with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the main regulator of national banks, as well as with the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of Thrift Supervision.

Strong quarterly numbers from technology bellwether International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and beverage giant Coca-Cola (KO.N) boosted technology and consumer shares in the first heavy week of second-quarter results. IBM gained nearly 5 percent, leading the Dow’s gainers.   Markets surged after President Obama suggested progress was being made toward a deficit reduction deal. The White House and Congress need to sign a deal that includes an increase in the federal debt ceiling by Aug. 2 or the United States could default on its debt.   “Stocks are starting to bounce at least for the time being, with people wagering that there will be a resolution on the debt ceiling,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at John Thomas Financial in New York.   The S&P information technology sector .GSPT gained 2.5 percent, making it the top gainer among S&P sectors. Shares of Apple (AAPL.O) hit a 52-week high ahead of its report due after the closing bell.

48,WFC,U.S. banks project lower debit card fee losses,"CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Two of the largest U.S. consumer banks said on Tuesday they expect new limits on debit card fees to have less of an impact than originally projected, after regulators softened the rules.  Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co both lowered their estimates during second-quarter earnings results for the revenue hit they expect from the so-called Durbin Amendment.  The rule — which caps the fees that banks can charge merchants for processing debit card transactions — was a key provision of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law passed last year.  BofA, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said it expects a $475 million quarterly reduction in card revenue — or $1.9 billion annually. That figure is lower than the $2 billion annualized loss BofA initially projected, absent any other efforts to recover lost revenue.  San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said the change should cost the bank $250 million per quarter, down from a $325 million estimate earlier this year.  The banks revised their estimates due to an unexpected increase in the proposed rate set by the Federal Reserve for interchange fees.  Late last year, the Fed proposed a 12 cents-per-transaction cap. That limit was then raised after a public comment period to 21 cents per transaction on June 29.  The financial industry fought the initial limit, arguing banks could not make up their costs of providing debit card services at that rate.  At BofA’s investor day in March, Joe Price, BofA’s consumer bank chief, said the industry could lose $12 billion to $14 billion in annual revenue under the initial rule.  Most of the large U.S. banks have since announced account fees and other charges for consumers to make up for the lost interchange revenue.

53,WFC,Fed hits Wells Fargo with $85 million mortgage penalty,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co agreed to pay a $85 million civil penalty to the Federal Reserve Board for allegedly steering borrowers into costly subprime mortgages, the largest fine the Fed has ever imposed in a consumer-enforcement case.  San Francisco-based Wells Fargo will also compensate borrowers in connection with sales practices at a Wells subsidiary, according to a cease and desist order issued by the Fed on Wednesday. Those costs have a potential to reach $200 million.  Banks continue to suffer fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis. Last month, Bank of America said it would pay $8.5 billion to settle lawsuits from mortgage bond investors and take more than $14 billion of other home loan-related charges.  A Fed spokeswoman on Wednesday said the Wells Fargo penalties were not part of a broader deal between federal regulators and mortgage servicing companies announced in April to settle mortgage fraud allegations.  She also declined to say whether the Fed was pursuing similar penalties against other mortgage lenders for underwriting abuses.  Politicians and consumer advocates have long criticized banks for enticing borrowers into subprime loans when they could have qualified for more affordable prime mortgages.  Wells Fargo did not admit any wrongdoing in agreeing to the cease and desist order.  “The alleged actions committed by a relatively small group of team members are not what we stand for at Wells Fargo,” said Chief Executive John Stumpf in a statement.  Wells Fargo might have to pay between $1,000 and $20,000 in restitution to borrowers affected by the alleged faulty mortgage practices, the order said. The number of borrowers who may be compensated is estimated to be between 3,700 and possibly more than 10,000, meaning the potential exposure could reach $200 million.  The company has accounted for this matter in its reserves, according to a Wells statement.  The cease and desist order also addresses allegations that Wells Fargo sales personnel falsified information to make it appear that borrowers qualified for loans, when they would not have qualified based on their actual incomes.  The company terminated the individuals involved, and closed its Wells Fargo Financial division in July 2010, it said in a statement.  The order provides for Wells to submit a fraud prevention and detection plan within 90 days. Wells is also required to modify its compensation and performance management programs for sales personnel in mortgage lending, to make them consistent with the company’s overall practices.  Those performance incentives should encourage sales staff to fully implement anti-fraud measures, the order says.  The Fed said it has issued orders against 16 former Wells Fargo Financial sales personnel prohibiting them from becoming employed in the banking industry.

56,WFC,PRESS DIGEST - Wall Street Journal - July 20," July 20 (Reuters) - The following were the top stories in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.	   * Long envied as one of the savviest gamblers around, Goldman Sachs Group Inc surprised Wall Street with a steep decline in trading revenue because it stopped rolling the dice. Goldman’s nimble trades routinely put the firm at the top of the heap over the past decade, notably during the financial crisis. But executives said Tuesday that economic and political turmoil around the world has caused the firm to lose much of its appetite for taking chances. 	   * Since Steve Jobs went on medical leave this winter, some members of Apple Inc’s board have discussed CEO succession with executive recruiters and at least one head of a high-profile technology company, according to people familiar with the matter.	   * HSBC Holdings PLC is moving to mollify federal authorities investigating how the banking industry has helped U.S. clients evade taxes. The global banking giant is cutting ties with wealthy American clients who bank offshore, as U.S. prosecutors turn up the heat on the bank to produce information about account holders who may be evading taxes, people familiar with the matter say.	   * Even with the economy stuck in neutral, three of the nation’s biggest lenders — Bank of America Corp , Wells Fargo & Co and KeyCorp — are sounding more hopeful that businesses are accelerating their borrowing. 	   The trio of banks reported second-quarter results Tuesday, each giving hope that businesses are taking loans used for everything from hiring to buying equipment, though the rate at which the customers are actually using lines of credit remains low.	   * Caterpillar Inc has slipped in a crucial part of the Chinese construction market. The company, which has made sales of construction machinery in China a top priority, has lost market share to local rivals there over the past five years in one of the most important product categories, hydraulic excavators.	   * The financial crisis showed how much the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission have struggled to shoulder their regulatory loads.

58,WFC,Geithner gave Fed official waiver on AIG holdings,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, while head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, granted a waiver that allowed his eventual successor William Dudley to hold on to investments in firms getting emergency help.  Dudley, a former partner at Goldman Sachs who at the time ran the New York Fed’s powerful markets desk, was allowed to maintain his financial stake in insurance giant AIG, whose government bailout helped prop up investment firms like Goldman Sachs.  Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent and a critic of the Fed’s financial bailouts, called the finding from a Government Accountability Office audit released on Thursday “disturbing.”  The GAO recommended the Fed strengthen policies to prevent conflicts of interest, in particular in instances of emergency lending to non-bank institutions. Current policy focuses more narrowly on banks and bank holding companies.  “(Three) days after the Federal Reserve Board authorized FRBNY (the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) to assist AIG — the then-FRBNY President granted ... a waiver to a senior management official with financial interests in AIG and GE (General Electric) who was involved in decision making related to these two companies,” the investigative agency said.  The New York Fed justified the waiver to Dudley on the grounds that he was critical to emergency operations, that the value of his investment in AIG was worth less than $15,000, and that divesting might violate laws on insider trading, according to the report.  “William Dudley, who was then head of the Markets Group at the New York Fed, held shares in these companies as part of his personal portfolio that predated his service at the New York Fed,” a New York Fed spokesperson said in reaction to the report.  The spokesperson said divestiture might have created the appearance of a conflict of interest. Dudley has since disposed of the shares.  The GAO said that of 12 staffers who volunteered potential conflicts of interest, the New York Fed ethics office required four to sell their stakes. The New York Fed declined a request to identify other staffers who received waivers.  The Treasury declined to comment on Geithner’s role in granting the waivers.  The Fed’s aggressive rescue efforts during the 2007-2009 financial crisis are viewed by many as having prevented an even deeper economic downturn. Officials were confronted with a fast-moving crisis that required quick responses.  The extraordinary efforts threw a spotlight on the central bank’s power and raised questions about the close connections between the Fed and the financial institutions it oversees.  The GAO in its report also said the Fed should bolster policies for awarding contracts to carry out emergency activities.  The Fed awarded contracts worth $660 billion to private firms to carry out emergency efforts during the crisis, and eight out of the 10 highest-value contracts were awarded without a bidding process, the report said.  Many of the firms picked to run emergency programs were themselves getting Fed loans at rock bottom interest rates, Sanders said. Firms included JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.  The disclosure comes as the GAO prepares another study on the governance of the regional Fed banks that, together with the Fed’s Board of Governors in Washington, form the U.S. central bank system. That study is due out this fall.  Among the 12 regional Fed banks, the New York institution is first among peers because of its location on the doorstep of financial markets. Its president has a permanent vote on the Fed’s interest rate-setting panel and it manages the Fed’s all-important market operations.  The Fed was embarrassed in early 2009 when it became public that New York Fed Board Chairman Stephen Friedman, a member of the Goldman Sachs board, held a substantial amount of stock in that company when it was allowed to come under the Fed’s protection during the crisis.  Friedman defended the holding, for which he received a waiver, but resigned from his position to spare the Fed the controversy.  Last year’s Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, which mandated the GAO study, made some changes to the powers of regional Fed board members, including taking away the right of some of them to vote for the regional presidents. The presidents participate in meetings of the Fed’s influential policy committee and get to vote on interest rate decisions.

60,WFC,Exclusive: Paulson says bets were too aggressive,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A humbled John Paulson told investors on Thursday he was “too aggressive” with some of the stock bets in his flagship funds and he is trimming back some of his riskiest holdings.  The hedge fund manager told clients in a conference call that he was dialing back the risk by moving away from bank holdings with heavy mortgage exposure.  The investor call came after a tumultuous first half of the year for Paulson, whose flagship Paulson Advantage fund lost about 12 percent. A related fund called Advantage Plus was off 18 percent.  He told investors that in the wake of the Advantage funds’ hefty losses on Sino Forest, a Chinese lumber and forestry company, he intends to beef up his Asian research team. Paulson did not point fingers at anyone for the Sino Forest debacle. But the manager said his 120-person firm needs to know the region better before it takes new bets.  “We’ll have to strengthen our research capabilities there,” Paulson said on the conference call for investors which Reuters heard portions of.  The billionaire trader said on the call that investing with him would never be free from turbulence, but he said that global economic factors have made this year’s ride bumpier than he is willing to stomach.  Europe’s debt crisis, fears about new financial market regulation and a slow U.S. economic recovery created problems for the New York-based firm, said Paulson, one of the world’s most closely watched investors.  But some of the losses, like Sino Forest, were of his own making. During the call, he took about 100 minutes to explain to investors his missteps and how he was reshaping the portfolio in response the funds’ poor performance this year.  The timing of the call was critical because it came as large institutional investors like state pension funds and wealthy private investors have only a few weeks left to put in a request to withdraw money from the funds. Already, some investors have told Reuters they intend to put in redemptions by the middle of August.  Until this year, Paulson was the toast of the $2 trillion hedge fund world after his big gamble on the collapse of the U.S. housing market made him a billionaire many times over. Paulson now says that his timing may be off on his bet that U.S. economy is poised for a strong rebound.  Paulson conceded that his research analysts were hearing rumblings about problems at Sino Forest for months and that his trading desk received requests to borrow the stock to short it. Indeed Paulson was trimming the position when the Muddy Waters research report alleging account problems hit.  “I should have been more receptive to this information,” Paulson said.  The Advantage Funds oversee roughly $18 billion in assets, a big portion of Paulson & Co’s roughly $38 billion in assets.  Paulson said he cut the net long exposure from roughly 81 percent to about 60 percent, and plans to cut it more. “Eighty-one percent was way too high. We cannot operate the fund at that level,” he said. “I’d like to bring the risk down further to about 50 percent.”  As a long-time owner of large financial companies such as Bank of America (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N), Paulson said the former — his sixth largest position at the end of the first quarter — was “somewhat of a disappointment.”  He said his analysts did not expect the magnitude of the mortgage problems to be so great.  To reposition the portfolio, Paulson said he diversified into financial companies with less exposure to mortgage loans, noting that he liked Capital One (COF.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N), two names he owned at the end of the first quarter.  He also said he increased his bet that the euro currency would fall as a hedge against further fallout from Europe’s debt crisis.

61,WFC,Analysis: Banks' efficiency drive a prelude to amputations,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Banks are dieting now, but surgery is next.  A raft of banks have announced cost-cutting measures in the last week as loan growth proves tepid and trading slow. Wells Fargo said it plans to cut costs by $6 billion a year by the end of 2012, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said it will cut $1.2 billion. Bank of America said it is working on a big cost-saving plan whose details will be revealed in October.  But the announcements are likely a prelude to banks rethinking their businesses much more seriously as they wrestle with weak loan demand as well as new capital requirements and tougher regulations.  Once banks are done reducing administrative staff and cutting salaries for their best-paid bankers, they will have to think about more radical steps, like shedding units and exiting markets that are not sufficiently profitable.  “The banks will all cut costs, and then there will be the question of is that enough,” said Blake Howells, director of equity research at Becker Capital Management in Portland, Oregon.  Banks so far are favoring standard cost-cutting moves to rein in expenses. A big chunk of Wells Fargo Corp’s (WFC.N) $6 billion of cost-cutting, for example, is expected to come from improving efficiency through steps like merging data centers and better automating its payment processing, Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said on a conference call.  State Street Corp (STT.N), a trust bank hit by low interest rates, said on Tuesday that it will eliminate 850 positions in the second phase of a campaign launched last year with 1,400 job cuts.  Cost-cutting for now is being triggered mainly by weak loan demand and low interest rates. Higher-yielding loans like mortgages are maturing, only to be replaced by lower-yielding new loans or government securities — if they are replaced at all.  Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) net interest margin — the difference between the rate it borrows at and the rate it lends at — was down to 2.50 percent in the second quarter from 2.77 percent a year earlier. Wells Fargo’s margin, one of the highest in the industry, was down 0.37 percentage point over the same period to 4.01 percent.  “You’ve got to run pretty hard just to cover the runoff,” Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf told analysts on Tuesday.  Banks, he said, are in “one of the toughest environments I have ever seen.”  Wells Fargo is so short of customers who want to borrow that Stumpf said the bank “is sitting on almost $90 billion of liquidity ... We are not even earning our cost of deposits on that.”  If that were the only headwinds that banks faced, simple cost-cutting might be enough. But new capital requirements could result in banks having a higher cost of funds, and new financial regulation could make other businesses more expensive to be in.  For an example of the difficulties facing banks, look at HSBC (HSBA.L). The biggest bank in Europe said in May that more than 40 percent of its businesses were delivering returns below the bank’s cost of capital.  HSBC is looking at serious measures to fix that, including selling its U.S. credit card portfolio and shedding branches in Upstate New York. Generally, it is trying to focus on its main businesses and get out of areas that are “noncore.” Some investors believe that even these steps are not enough.  As goes HSBC, so other banks will go, analysts and bank executives said.  One former bank chief executive told Reuters, “The first step is to cut costs, but eventually you have to go through the process of figuring out how you justify being in businesses whose returns are not exceeding their cost of capital.”  Wells Fargo hinted at just that on Tuesday, telling analysts it will be reviewing all lines of business to see if they are worth keeping.  Said David Hendler, analyst at CreditSights, “It’s going to happen even to the stronger guys.”  If bank businesses can’t earn their cost of capital, “they’re going to have to run them off, sell them off or spin them off,” he said.

62,WFC,Bank cash cushions can soften U.S. credit blow," * Wall Street moves into liquid assets as default looms   * Record liquidity levels give banks advantage—experts   * Such low-yielding investments have weighed on earnings   By Lauren Tara LaCapra   NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - Investors have long complained about cash sitting idle on bank balance sheets, but recently these cash cushions have become a lot more valuable.   As the U.S. lumbers toward Aug. 2 without an agreement to raise the debt ceiling — and the threat of a U.S. downgrade or default looms — banks with strong cash reserves are looking increasingly judicious.   Market experts say a downgrade or default would trigger higher margin calls across Wall Street on trillions of dollars’ worth of transactions. On Monday, CME Group Inc (CME.O) became the first major clearinghouse to raise collateral requirements for trades backed by Treasury bills.   “In an environment like this ... you want to keep liquidity as high as possible,” said Terry Belton, global head of fixed income strategy at JPMorgan Chase. “I think most firms have been trying to achieve that.”   Belton and others involved with preparations by large banks said the industry has been moving into shorter-term investments that can be turned into cash immediately, even if interest margins suffer from weak yields.   Banks have also been reducing exposure to debt backed by U.S. agencies, such as Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB. Such bonds are also at risk of a downgrade if the U.S. government’s rating is lowered and are viewed as less safe than Treasury bills.   Earlier this month, the biggest U.S. banks revealed hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of liquidity sitting on their balance sheets when discussing second-quarter earnings results. During conference calls, executives were grilled by analysts about their apparent cash-hoarding.   Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said it had $166 billion in “excess” liquidity at quarter-end, representing 18 percent of its balance sheet. Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said Goldman “underperformed” during the period in part because it reduced risk and boosted the capital and liquidity it is holding to protect against market uncertainty.   Bank of America-Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski was not impressed. Was the “liquidity drag” responsible for Goldman’s miserly 6.1 percent return-on-equity number, he asked.   At Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Chief Executive John Stumpf complained about rising cash reserves. He noted that Wells is “sitting on almost $90 billion of liquidity” that is not even earning the cost of Wells Fargo’s deposits.   Still, Stumpf urged investors to give the bank credit for its caution.   “This wonderful deposit franchise we have is ... really undervalued in today’s economic times,” he said.   JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said its “global liquidity reserve” was $404 billion, up 28 percent from three months earlier.   Questioned by Sanford Bernstein analyst John McDonald about all that liquidity sloshing around its balance sheet, Chief Financial Officer Doug Braunstein said the bank was not deliberately seeking low-yielding cash, but “just dealing with the deposits as they come in.”   In hindsight, though, JPMorgan investors can take solace in the bank’s well-oiled deposit-gathering machine.   “There’s the potential for a near-term liquidity event,” said Steven H. Turner, partner & leader of the risk practice at consulting firm Novantas, a consultancy that advises some of the 20 largest global retail banks. “The best way to deal with that is to stockpile liquidity.”   (Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; editing by Andre Grenon)  ",7262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/banks-default/bank-cash-cushions-can-soften-u-s-credit-blow-idUSN1E76O1ZI20110726
63,WFC,Banking nominees get warm reception,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bank regulator nominees said on Tuesday that they support tougher bank capital standards and would work to convince markets that the era of government bailouts for too-big-to-fail banks is over.  The Senate Banking Committee held a hearing Tuesday on the nominations of Thomas Curry to head the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Martin Gruenberg to head the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  Both agencies will play key roles in implementing the tougher capital standards agreed to earlier this year by international regulators as well as the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law.  The OCC regulates national banks such as Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup while the FDIC insures customer bank deposits up to $250,000.  Curry and Gruenberg are currently members of the FDIC board.  The Obama administration has had a difficult time getting Republican support for nominees for top financial regulatory jobs, most notably the vacancy atop the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  Curry and Gruenberg, however, received a positive response from both Republicans and Democrats on Tuesday and could be confirmed to their spots in the coming weeks.  Gruenberg, a former aide to the Banking Committee, has the public support of Richard Shelby, the ranking Republican on the committee.  Shelby said he is still reviewing the records of Curry and Roy Woodall, the nominee to be the insurance expert on the Financial Stability Oversight Council, but added that they look good.  Woodall also testified on Tuesday.  Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson said in an interview that he would try to hold a committee vote on the three nominees before the Senate goes on its August recess, scheduled to begin in two weeks.  One possible delay facing Gruenberg is that the president has yet to announce nominees for two vacant spots on the five-member FDIC board.  When asked if these nominees would have to be named before he would support moving the Gruenberg nomination to a vote, Shelby said: “We like to move things in tandem.”  Republicans are standing firm in their promise to block the nomination of Richard Corday to head the consumer bureau unless changes are made to the agency that Democrats oppose.  Johnson said he does not yet know when a confirmation hearing for Cordray will be held.  The international capital agreement, known as Basel III, will require banks to maintain top-quality capital equal to 7 percent of their risk-bearing assets.  On top of that, global “systemic” banks — a group expected to include JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo — may have to hold as much as an additional 2.5 percent as a buffer. Another 1 percent surcharge would be imposed if a bank becomes significantly bigger.  Some banks have balked at the reforms, which would roughly triple current capital standards, arguing they will restrict the amount banks can lend and hurt the economy.  Supporters of the standards say the new rules would provide more stability to the financial system and minimize the kind of chaos that occurred during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  “Having strong capital levels in place in advance of an economic downturn is critically important,” Curry said after telling the committee he supports the agreement.  Gruenberg also threw his support behind the new standards.  “From both the domestic standpoint and an international standpoint it seems to us to be a significant step forward,” he told the committee.  Under Dodd-Frank the government can take over large, failing financial companies and it is the FDIC’s job to liquidate them.  Supporters argue this plan will curb taxpayer bailouts and limit the sort of market turmoil caused by the 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.  Credit rating agencies and other market participants have expressed skepticism the government will not ultimately step in and bail out large companies if they begin to topple.  Gruenberg said he is not surprised markets are skeptical but that the agency has the tools to make sure companies can fail without government bailouts.  “Simply providing the authority is not a demonstration of the capability of willingness to carry it out,” he said. “I think the challenge to the FDIC, in particular, will be to demonstrate both we have the capacity and the willingness to implement it.”  ",7262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-financial-regulation-nominations/banking-nominees-get-warm-reception-idUSTRE76P6BC20110726

66,WFC,Justice Department presses Wells Fargo on loans: source,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co and the Department of Justice are negotiating to settle allegations that the bank illegally targeted African-Americans for expensive subprime loans, according to a source familiar with the matter.  The source, who declined to be identified because the talks were not public, said the bank was talking with lawyers from the department’s civil rights division.

68,WFC,Fund managers seek freedom not to sell on U.S. downgrade,"BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some major bond fund managers are asking their institutional clients to consider waiving strict requirements that might force mass selling of Treasury bonds if the United States loses its AAA rating.  Pension funds, endowments and other large investors typically establish rules governing how their assets can be invested when they sign on with a money manager. Some analysts fear a downgrade of the U.S. rating would spark a mass sell-off because of guidelines that only permit investments in AAA-rated securities.  Conservative investors would be poorly served if fund managers had to sell off Treasury securities because of a downgrade, said John Donaldson, director of fixed income at Haverford Investments in Radnor, Pennsylvania.  “In that situation, you’d want the safety of the instruments most likely to pay off,” he said “It’s hard to say a flight to quality should include something else.”  BlackRock, the largest money manager in the world, held calls with clients last week to review possible scenarios if the U.S. is downgraded.  On the calls, which were led by Senior Managing Director Peter Fisher and Vice Chairman Barbara Novick, clients were asked to consider if limitations on holding debt rated less than AAA should be revised and whether strict sell-down requirements were appropriate.  “We’ve been working with clients steadily to make sure they are thinking about this and preparing for it,” spokeswoman Bobbie Collins said.  New York-based BlackRock oversees almost $3.7 trillion, including $612 billion in actively managed institutional fixed income accounts and $438 billion in indexed institutional fixed income accounts.  T Rowe Price Group Inc in Baltimore has spoken with several institutional investors in recent days regarding whether guidelines on separately managed accounts should be revised, given the possibility of a U.S. debt downgrade.  “We are looking into whether or not a restatement of the guidelines may be required, and what this may involve,” spokeswoman Heather McDonold said. The firm manages $520.9 billion, including $132.3 billion in fixed income.  The institutional asset management unit of Wells Fargo has also been talking with some of its clients about changing investment rules and possibly signing waivers to avoid forced selling of Treasuries in case of a downgrade.  The issue has only come up with a “handful of accounts,” a spokeswoman said. “We would like to get contingency plans in place,” she said. “That may or may not include signing of waivers.”  The San Francisco-based bank’s Wells Capital Management unit manages $355 billion, including $111 billion in institutional separate accounts.  The fixed-income managers at JPMorgan Chase & Co have also been reaching out to clients to ensure that they aware of the implications of ratings changes on investments.  “We have been actively reviewing guidelines and contacting clients to discuss potential portfolio considerations where necessary,” spokeswoman Kristen Chambers said.  The New York-based bank manages $1.3 trillion, including $708 billion for institutional investors.  The three major bond agencies have said they will lower debt ratings of federal agencies and state and local government bonds if the United States loses its top-notch rating.  Standard & Poor’s has warned that it may strip the U.S. AAA-rating even if the White House and Congress reach a deal to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling without a credible plan to reduce its deficit.

71,WFC,HSBC sheds U.S. branches in $1 billion First Niagara pact,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc on Sunday said it will shed nearly half of its underperforming U.S. branch network, selling 195 branches to First Niagara Financial Group Inc for about $1 billion, and closing 13 others.  The all-cash sale to First Niagara covers more than 40 percent of HSBC’s roughly 470 U.S. branches, including 183 in upstate New York, six in New York City suburbs and six in Connecticut. It also includes $15 billion of deposits, $2.8 billion of loans and $4.3 billion of assets under management.  Following the transaction, Buffalo, New York-based First Niagara expects to be significantly larger, with about 450 branches, $38 billion of assets and $30 billion of deposits. It expects to divest some branches to meet antitrust concerns. An early 2012 closing is expected, pending regulatory approvals.  HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver in May set plans for Europe’s largest bank to slash $3.5 billion of costs by cutting back in retail banking and selling its U.S. credit card unit, which has more than $30 billion of assets.  The bank has been criticized for spreading itself too widely, with roughly 95 million customers and 300,000 employees in 87 markets, without sufficient regard for profitability.  Forty-two percent of HSBC businesses are returning less than its 11 percent cost of capital, and the bank has said it will exit Russia and Poland.  HSBC is expected on Monday to report first-half results. Analysts on average expect a pretax profit of $10.9 billion, compared with $11.1 billion a year earlier.  In May, HSBC said its U.S. banking unit HSBC Bank USA had a “record of underperformance,” and that it would focus its operations on U.S. clients with international business and non-U.S. clients with business in the United States.  “HSBC is committed to the U.S. and leveraging our international network and skill-set, which are our competitive advantages,” Niall Booker, chief executive of HSBC North America, said in a statement on Sunday.  The 13 branches that HSBC plans to close are located in Connecticut and New Jersey, and are near other HSBC branches. HSBC has about 370 branches in New York.  The bank did not immediately return requests on Sunday for further comment.  Other bidders for the branches included KeyCorp and M&T Bank Corp, while bidders for the credit card unit have included Capital One Financial Corp and Wells Fargo & Co, people familiar with the matter said earlier in July.  First Niagara Chief Executive John Koelmel in an interview said his bank expects to divest 20 percent to 25 percent of the 195 HSBC branches to satisfy regulators and reduce overlap.  “We have staked out a footprint that runs from Buffalo to Boston to Philly and back to Pittsburgh,” he said. “It is all about having meaningful presence in the markets we choose to serve.”  Koelmel also said he was “sensitive” to valuations, especially given that the transaction is all cash, at a time of uncertainty about the economy and market environment.  “You can argue that this is a horrible time to do anything: Washington can’t do anything, and markets are in a state of high alert,” he said. “It’s somewhere between a mess and an embarrassing train wreck. I’m always one who believes that in the private sector we have to have the courage to lead in spite of that. We can’t be unduly deterred by what the markets in general are doing.”  First Niagara expects the transaction to boost operating earnings, after merger costs, by 10 percent to 11 percent in 2012. It plans to issue $750 million to $800 million of stock and $350 million to $400 million of debt before the closing.  Most of the 1,900 workers at the 195 HSBC branches are expected to keep their jobs, including at branches that are sold, First Niagara said.  First Niagara said it was advised by Goldman Sachs & Co, Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP and the law firm Pepper Hamilton, while HSBC was advised by its own investment bankers, JPMorgan and the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell.  Shares of First Niagara closed Friday at $12.25 on the Nasdaq.

76,WFC,"UPDATE 1-BofA, Citi shares down on Euro, U.S. worries"," * BofA shares down 7.5 pct, Citi down about 4 pct   * KBW Bank Index off 2.2 percent  (Updates stock prices; adds details on Citi and BofA exposures, analyst comment; rewrites throughout)   By Joe Rauch   CHARLOTTE, N.C., Aug 5 (Reuters) - The shares of Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), the major U.S. banks hit hardest by the financial crisis, dropped on Friday amid investors fears that global economic weakness will hamper their recovery.   The banks’ shares performed worse than their broader sectors and Bank of America’s shares closed at their lowest since April 2009.   Analysts said investors are selling off BofA and Citi shares because the banks are still struggling to become as profitable as rivals and could be hurt by the recent economic turmoil.   Bank of America could need to boost capital by $50 billion in the coming years, according to an estimate in June from Richard Staite of Atlantic Equities.   The bank is hoping it can earn enough money to make up for any capital shortfalls. But significant earnings could be tougher to come by if the economy is as sluggish as it has seemed recently, analysts said.   “It feels like the economic scenarios around the bank have gotten worse and for investors it feels like the risks are increasing,” said Jefferson Harralson, a bank analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc.   Bank of America's shares have fallen more than 14 percent since Wednesday, while Citi's have fallen 10.25 percent. The broader market has fallen as well, but not as much -- the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX fell 4.8 percent over that period.   The broader market malaise caused BofA global wealth and investment management president Sallie Krawcheck and her top lieutenants to cancel late on Friday afternoon a teleconference with the media scheduled for Monday to discuss problems of affluent Americans.   Adding to Bank of America’s difficulties, New York’s attorney general said he will oppose the bank’s $8.5 billion settlement with investors over toxic mortgage loans. [ID:nN1E773268]   “It makes you feel like the potential losses could be increasing again,” Harralson said.   In a sign of the bank’s eagerness to reach out to skittish  investors, Bank of America’s Chief Executive Officer, Brian Moynihan, agreed to be interviewed by fund manager Bruce Berkowitz next week, to talk about the bank’s strategy.   Meanwhile, Citi has $22 billion in exposure to the countries at the center of the European debt crisis and extensive exposure to the eurozone as a whole.   BofA shares fell 7.48 percent to close at $8.17, their lowest close since April 2009, while Citi fell 3.94 percent to close at $33.44, their lowest level since February 2010.   In contrast, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) shares were off 0.8 percent at $37.60 and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) closed down 2 percent at $25.21. The KBW Bank Index .BKX was off 2.2 percent in its second consecutive day of losses.   Both banks, unlike their rivals, pay a quarterly dividend of a penny a share.   Analysts said investors are more likely to put their money into bank stocks with higher dividend payouts.   “Their lack of dividend, and (lack of potential) for growth here, is hurting them more,” said Jason Ware, an equity analyst with Albion Financial Group.   Both BofA and Citi have struggled to match the profitability of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, and are still saddled with billions in credit problems, or trying to sell under-performing divisions.   BofA recorded its largest quarterly loss in the company’s history in the second quarter after it recorded $20 billion in charges related to buying back toxic mortgages. The charges included an $8.5 billion settlement with a group of investors over Countrywide Financial Corp-created mortgage bonds.   Some estimates have said BofA might need to raise as much as $50 billion in capital to absorb losses and meet new industry capital rules in the coming years.   BofA’s executives have said they can raise additional capital through earnings, rather than an additional stock offering.

Edwards & Sons, on Friday said it hired five financial advisers from Wells Fargo Advisors and opened its first New Jersey office.   St. Louis-based Edwards said Todd Leonhardt, a 23-year veteran, would manage its new office in affluent Red Bank. Also joining are Michael Doherty, James Ireland, Richard Niekrash and Robert Sim.   Edwards will have now have a total of 18 offices in 12 states. It launched in 2008 — the same year Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) acquired Wachovia, which in 2007 had acquired A.G. Edwards.   For the past three years, CEO Tad Edwards has lured dozens of former A.G. Edwards advisers away from Wells Fargo, parent of the third-largest brokerage.

78,WFC,"Wall Street to brokers: Investors should buy, not flee","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street’s advice to investors battered by plunging markets: Keep buying stocks.  With markets plunging for more than a week, and no relief in sight, some of the biggest brokerages on Thursday afternoon and early on Friday told their advisers that clients should not flee but instead buy into the panic.  “Mr. Market is often wrong and panic selling is dangerous,” David Bianco, chief U.S. strategist for Merrill Lynch global research, wrote in a strategy note. “Panic selling in a correction is dangerous, as the best days usually closely follow the worst.”  The benchmark S&P 500 Index sank into “correction” territory on Thursday, falling more than 10 percent from highs reached in April, and slipped again on Friday despite an early rally inspired by an encouraging job growth report.  Federal lawmakers reached a debt-ceiling agreement this week that removed the threat of a U.S. default and briefly inspired a burst of optimism. Yet investor sentiment quickly became gloomy again amid persistent views that weakness in the U.S. economy and spreading sovereign debt problems in Europe would lead to another slowdown.  Merrill Lynch strategists, in a conference call early Friday for its 16,241 advisers, said clients should buy the largest companies in the S&P 500 — excluding financial services stocks.  Bianco, in a research note, predicted corporate earnings growth will slow to high single-digit rates, prompting analysts to “trim but not slash” their 2012 profit forecasts. Business spending will remain robust, particularly among energy, mining, transportation, utility and capital goods companies.  Wells Fargo Advisors, third among U.S. broker-dealers with 15,194 advisers, recommended that long-term investors trim their bond exposure by 2 percent and bump up their holdings in large-cap stocks by a similar amount.  “It is still too early to jump into the market in a big way, but long-term investors should use current market weakness to add to equity positions,” Wells strategists wrote in a special market update for advisers.  The Wells Fargo & Co unit repeated these views in a live “radio show” Thursday afternoon that had been scheduled to discuss this week’s debt-ceiling agreement by U.S. lawmakers.  At Charles Schwab Corp, call center volume was up more than 30 percent on Thursday as nervous clients sought investment advice, spokesman Greg Gable said.  Schwab also posts regular commentary from its chief investment strategist on its website, which has been getting a lot of traffic as well. The general message that “you don’t want to design an investing strategy in the moment of a market panic,” Gable said.  Edward D. Jones & Co, whose more than 12,000 retail brokers cater to small investors, said the economy may be growing slowly but it is not shrinking.  Jones investment strategist Kate Warne, in a note to financial advisers, said investors are ignoring some positive signals: banks are in good health, oil prices are below $90 a barrel and companies are financially stronger.  “Don’t let (market) declines cause you to make decisions to overturn your investment strategy,” Warne advised the firm’s brokers. “Instead, consider adding quality stocks, especially those that have a track record of increasing their dividends.”  In Toronto, Royal Bank of Canada’s global asset management unit said it was finalizing a special commentary to help provide its advisers with market context and positioning.  A Bank of Montreal broker said Canada’s No. 4 bank had not reached out to its advisers since last week when the debt ceiling debate was coming to a head, though nerves are still frazzled.  “It honestly feels like you’re walking in a field of land mines and you’re about to step on another one,” said the adviser, who had not been cleared to speak with the media.  Michael Ryan, chief investment strategist for UBS Wealth Management Americas, told the firm’s 6,862 advisers investors should refrain from liquidating their positions into the panic, saying stocks are “deeply oversold.”  That said, the selling pressure will likely persist.  “The market damage experienced over the past two weeks has been stunning with regard to both speed and scope, and it will take time before markets recover,” Ryan wrote in a research note distributed through UBS’s market response center.

83,WFC,Wells Fargo to pay $590 million in Wachovia suit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co reached a $590 million deal to resolve a lawsuit alleging Wachovia misled investors about the quality of loans sold before the financial crisis, one of the largest settlements of its kind stemming from the housing market meltdown.  The accord is the latest attempt by Wells Fargo to settle litigation troubles it inherited after it agreed in October 2008 to buy Wachovia, then on the brink of collapse.  Auditor KPMG LLP, also a defendant in the lawsuit, agreed to pay $37 million to settle, bringing the total recovery for the investors to $627 million, said Darren Robbins, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.  The settlement is a major victory for investors in a case stemming from the credit crisis, Robbins said. In February, a federal judge in Los Angeles approved a $601.5 million settlement of a lawsuit against Countrywide Financial Corp, now part of Bank of America Corp, over allegations it misled investors about its financial health and lending practices.  The settlements are subject to court approval.  Wachovia, once the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, struggled when more borrowers fell behind on its roughly $120 billion of “option” adjustable-rate mortgages, including many from its purchase of Golden West in 2006.  The mortgages, known as “Pick-A-Pay” loans, let borrowers make low payments that did not cover monthly interest, causing principal to rise.  The plaintiffs, purchasers of preferred securities and debt, alleged in court papers that Wachovia’s offering documents represented that the “Pick-A-Pay” portfolio was of “pristine credit quality” and that Wachovia and Golden West had engaged in “prudent lending practices.”  In reality, about $51 billion of the “Pick-A-Day” portfolio was made up of loans to subprime borrowers, the plaintiffs contended. They also said Wachovia routinely made loans to borrowers without verifying their income or job titles.  Wells Fargo disclosed the settlement in its quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It said the settlement is not expected to hurt its financial position and that it has been reflected in its financial statements.  Wells Fargo “agreed to this settlement in order to avoid the distraction, risk and expense of ongoing litigation,” a bank spokeswoman said.  The agreement does not “constitute an admission of Wells Fargo liability or any violation of law by Wachovia,” she said.  A spokesman for KPMG said the auditor had agreed to settle in order “to avoid the cost of litigation and to put the matter behind us.”  The lead plaintiffs in the case are pension funds from California and Louisiana, and a Pennsylvania public transportation system.  In April a federal judge in Manhattan dismissed three related shareholder lawsuits accusing Wachovia and its former executives of lying about the bank’s exposure to risky mortgage loans.  That same month, Wells agreed to pay $11.2 million to settle SEC civil charges that Wachovia charged excessive markups and used stale prices in selling mortgage-related debt.

86,WFC,Tepper sold nearly half of BofA shares in Q2-filing," BOSTON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager David Tepper, who earned billions by betting on battered financial shares, sold off nearly half of his stake in Bank of America (BAC.N) during the second quarter, according to a regulatory filing.   Tepper’s Appaloosa Management reported on Monday that it owned 10 million shares in the banking giant on June 30, down 42 percent from the 17 million shares he owned on March 31.   The giant hedge fund, whose views on the market are watched very closely, made its announcement in a routine filing that came on a day the bank’s shares tumbled more than 18 percent.   Bank of America had been Tepper’s seventh largest holding at the end of the first quarter.   Tepper would have sold the 7 million shares during the second quarter but the news likely still heaped fresh pressure on the stock on Monday as investors worried that large hedge funds have turned their back on the bank.   The filing also shows that Tepper cut his holding in Citigroup (C.N) to 7.2 million shares from 7.6 million during the quarter and trimmed his ownership in Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O).   Large investors, including hedge funds and mutual fund firms, are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to report which publicly traded U.S. stocks they own some 45 days after the end of the quarter.   The deadline for filing 13-F documents is early next week and most hedge funds wait until the last day to file them.   Cable television station CNBC reported on Monday that Tepper had sold off his Bank of America position and reportedly sold off his entire stake in Wells Fargo and significantly cut back his holdings in Citi.

The Bayside group will take a 75 to 80 percent stake, with the remainder going to Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Bank of Ireland BKIR.I, said Mark McDermott, Jackson Hewitt’s bankruptcy lawyer.   “We got a lot accomplished,” he said. “We managed to leave behind most of the litigation, and we did it all in only a couple of months.”   The plan also creates a $1.1 million trust to be paid out to unsecured creditors, said Christopher Winter, a lawyer for Jackson Hewitt’s official creditors’ committee, which supports the plan.   It will also allow a trustee to pursue about $2 million in so-called avoidance actions on behalf of unsecured creditors, Winter added. Shareholders will recover nothing.   “It was a very difficult case and there was no apparent value for unsecured creditors, so the committee is pleased with the outcome,” Winter said.   Jackson Hewitt did not immediately provide a comment. An attorney for the Bayside lenders could not be reached.   Jackson Hewitt filed for bankruptcy May 24, after regulators began clamping down on refund anticipation loans, which tax preparers often provide to tide over customers expecting refunds. Regulators called the loans unsafe, making it harder for tax preparers to secure funding for them.   The curbs caused Jackson Hewitt to get into trouble with lenders when it failed to secure full funding for the loans, a key covenant in its credit agreement.   In its May 24 bankruptcy filing, Jackson Hewitt showed assets of $388.6 million and debt of $444.8 million. The company said at the time it hoped to emerge within two months.   The case is In re: Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 11-11587.

Bank stocks broadly fell after Standard & Poor’s stripped the United States of its top credit rating and the European Central Bank intervened in bond markets, triggering fears that the global economy is destabilizing.  Bank of America’s shares fell more than most of its peers after insurer American International Group (AIG.N) said it would sue the bank to recoup more than $10 billion in mortgage bond losses.  Bank of America shares were down 8.4 percent at $7.48 in morning trading. The KBW Bank Index .BKX fell 2.97 percent.  Analysts said investors were reacting to the latest challenge to Bank of America’s $8.5 billion proposed settlement with mortgage investors over repurchasing toxic home loans.  “It makes investors question whether the bank will need to raise capital,” said Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc analyst Jefferson Harralson.  Citigroup Inc (C.N) shares fell 5.4 percent to $31.60, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) fell 2.1 percent to $36.80 and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) shares dipped 1.3 percent to $24.87.

The comments come just a few days after S&P stripped the United States of its top “AAA” rating, contributing to market turmoil that weighed on stocks and lifted Treasury prices.  S&P said its base forecast for the U.S. bank industry in 2011 still calls for a “moderate rise” in net income because credit losses are decreasing, allowing banks to draw down on reserves previously set aside to cover losses.  Banks will continue to suffer from a “moderate decline in revenues” because of modest loan growth and low interest rates, S&P said in slides posted on its website for a quarterly banking conference call on Tuesday.  “We expect 2Q trends to continue into 3Q but are more concerned about slower economic growth, sovereign debt issues, and continuing mortgage risks,” S&P said. In the second quarter, bank credit ratings, earnings, asset quality and capital strength were all better.  S&P’s comments came a day after shares of Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) plunged 20 percent, capping three days in which the biggest U.S. bank lost almost a third of its value. Shares of Citigroup Inc (C.N), the third-biggest bank, fell 16.4 percent on Monday.  The stocks recovered some of those losses on Tuesday, with Bank of America up 7.5 percent and Citigroup up 10.2 percent at midday. The KBW Index of U.S. bank stocks .BKX was up 4 percent.  Threats to S&P’s outlook include a U.S. economic slowdown and, particularly for large banks, mortgage market risks and European sovereign debt issues. U.S. regional banks are threatened by commercial real estate issues.  U.S. banks’ direct exposure to debt-troubled European countries “is not material, absent contagion,” S&P said.  While the largest banks recently benefited from additional work on takeovers and debt underwriting, “future improvements look less likely as U.S. economic trends weaken and sovereign debt issues continue,” S&P said.  The outline repeated S&P’s prior statements that its downgrade of U.S. government debt on Friday would not have an immediate or direct impact on its credit ratings for any banks.  “The sovereign downgrade does not alter the government support assumptions that we factor into our ratings,” said S&P, a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos Inc MHP.N.

91,WFC,Capital One nears HSBC U.S. cards buy: sources,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) is nearing a deal to sell its $30 billion-plus U.S. credit card business to Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N), sources familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.  HSBC confirmed talks to sell the business but did not name the buyer. A deal could be announced soon, the sources said.  Such a deal would mark the second time Capital One has swooped for unwanted U.S. assets from a retreating European bank in recent months. The McLean, Virginia-based firm said in June it was buying ING’s ING.AS U.S. online bank for $9 billion in cash and stock.  HSBC said in May it was looking to sell its U.S. card arm, which has about $31 billion of loans, as part of a radical overhaul and $3.5 billion cost-cutting plan under new Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver.  Capital One has been seen as a motivated buyer for the business as it looks to bulk up on assets after the ING Direct deal. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) was also interested in buying the portfolio, sources have said previously.  “These discussions are ongoing and no decision has yet been made to proceed with any transaction,” HSBC said in a statement on Tuesday. Gulliver said last week the bank was making progress in the planned sale.  HSBC, Europe’s biggest bank, last week said it will shed nearly half of its underperforming U.S. branch network, selling 195 branches to First Niagara Financial Group Inc FNFG.O for $1 billion and closing 13 more.  HSBC has been criticized for spreading itself too widely, gathering roughly 95 million customers across 87 markets, and Gulliver is aiming to put focus back on profitability.  Bankers have called HSBC’s U.S. cards a tough sale because not many buyers remain for such large credit card portfolios since the financial crisis.  A regulatory crackdown has made it harder to turn a profit, and industry observers have said it could be difficult for HSBC to get the premium it wants for the value of the business on its books.  Since 2007, both Citigroup Inc (C.N) and General Electric Co (GE.N) have tried — and failed — to sell similar large U.S. credit card portfolios.  Gulliver has said that HSBC will wind down the credit card business if it cannot find a buyer.  HSBC’s London-listed shares were down 2.2 percent by 1310 GMT, recovering some losses after touching their lowest level for two years.  Capital One spent much of the past decade transforming from a specialty credit card lender that mainly funded itself in the bond market, into a bank that relies heavily on deposits.  Now, facing weakened loan demand after the financial crisis, the bank is again looking for deals to expand its business.

92,WFC,COLUMN-Tax gateways to India: David Cay Johnston," The author is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.   By David Cay Johnston   SINGAPORE, Aug 9 (Reuters) - The equatorial island nations of Mauritius and Singapore are competing for the role of preferred gateway for foreign investments into India and other Asian countries.   Think of it as a triangle, not of love, but of lucre.   Companies and rich investors use gateway countries so they can earn profits in such places as India, China and Indonesia. Favorable tax treaties let them send dividends and other payments to such places as Mauritius and Singapore while paying little or no tax. The United States can even provide such benefits under some of its tax treaties.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   U.S. companies with subsidiaries in Mauritius, Singapore:   r.reuters.com/fag23s  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   These treaties are sold to the public as vital to avoiding double taxation of the same money and thus encouraging cross-border investments. Countries with tax treaties that enable lightly taxed or tax-free profits can benefit if their rules require local work by accountants, bankers, executives, investment bankers and lawyers, who earn high pay and require little in government services.   But just as tax laws can be drafted to fashion loopholes, so too can tax treaties.   One of the biggest loopholes involves what is commonly known as “black money” and a circular movement of capital known as “round tripping.”   Black money refers to capital that is being hidden, sometimes from the tax authorities and sometimes from partners, litigants, estranged spouses or even criminals such as loan sharks or drug dealers.   Round tripping involves getting the money out of one country, say India, sending it to a place like Mauritius and then, dressed up to look like foreign capital, sending it back home to earn tax-favored profits.   The problem for the home country is that native profits escape taxation this way. And instead of foreign capital flowing into the country, local capital just gets a free ride.   While the principles are simple, the mechanics of getting black money to a favored tax treaty partner can be the financial equivalent of a Rube Goldberg machine, only this is no complex contraption that ultimately turns on a toaster or opens a door. Instead, cash moves out of the country in seemingly nonsensical ways designed to throw off auditors or anyone else trying to follow the money. Once the cash is safely out of the mother country, it’s easy to place it in a jurisdiction with a favorable tax treaty and to use a shell company to send the money back home so profits become tax-free or taxed at very low rates.   Under a tax treaty signed 28 years ago, Mauritius has been the gateway country of choice for foreign investment in India. Companies like Caterpillar (CAT.N), the maker of earth-moving equipment, as well as Bank of America (BAC.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) invest in India via subsidiaries in Mauritius.   As the Indian economy has begun to take off — thanks to a mixture of high tech, manufacturing and call centers — seemingly foreign money has been pouring into India. Since the turn of the millennium about US$55 billion has come via shell companies set up in Mauritius. This is more than 40 percent of the direct foreign investment in India.   Tax authorities in New Delhi believe a lot of that investment was black money from India making a roundtrip to Mauritius. Overall the Indian Finance Ministry estimates faux foreign direct investments from Mauritius are costing it $600 million in taxes annually.   India is not alone in its suspicions. Indonesia terminated its tax treaty with Mauritius in 2005, convinced that its government treasury, or fisc, was under assault from round tripping of Indonesian black money.   In India, a series of scandals, tax audits and investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation, India’s anti-corruption agency, have strained the once intimate financial relationship with Mauritius.   And just as the two partners were sparring, along came Singapore, eager to show it can be a more faithful partner by acting as a tax-favored conduit for real foreign investment in India and not round tripping.   Singapore boasts that it does not allow shell companies, but rather wants a real economic presence. It puts the standard for that at S$200,000 a year spent running a Singapore office. That is a mere drop in a bucket of money, but as with perfume and love triangles, a drop may be all it takes to turn an already disaffected partner’s head.   While India has a reputation for letting legal issues drag on for years, it started talking publicly about a tax treaty with Singapore last year and the two signed an agreement in June. Whether the treaty will actually deter round tripping remains to be seen, but on paper it looks better for India than the Mauritius treaty.   Mauritius has for several years dallied on negotiating a new tax treaty with India. But the speed with which India moved to embrace Singapore clearly motivated Mauritius to pay more attention to its longtime partner.   This past week officials in Port Louis and Delhi spoke of a new agreement being almost at hand. But then that is often how it goes in triangles, when one party is unsure of whether to stick it out with the old partner or move on to a new one.

100,WFC,Banks pushing for legal shield on mortgages,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. banks still wrestling with legal troubles springing from the subprime mortgage crisis are lobbying the new consumer agency for strong legal protection for future home loans.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is finalizing a proposal to entice banks to offer straightforward loans — without interest-only payments and excessive fees — by providing a legal shield. The question is whether to give banks full protection, known as a “safe harbor,” or a more limited legal shelter.  “It is critically important that the final rule provide a safe harbor,” Bank of America Corp wrote in a July 22 letter. “If the final requirements instead increase the liability exposure of creditors ... the result will be increased costs and further reduction in credit availability to the very consumers that the reforms were designed to protect.”  The Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule on the matter earlier this year, but then punted it to the consumer agency, which now has jurisdiction. The agency, which was created by the Dodd-Frank oversight law, opened its doors on July 21.  This rule will be one of the first big tests of how tough the consumer agency will be on mortgage markets.  The proposal has already launched a flurry of letters from large banks such as Wells Fargo & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp.  Those banks and others are hobbled by stalled foreclosures nationwide due to legal questions and multibillion-dollar lawsuits from investors such as American International Group Inc that claim the quality of securities backing the mortgages was misrepresented.

101,WFC,U.S. banks pushing for legal shield on mortgages," * Banks want safe harbor for future high-quality mortgages   * Consumer advocates say lenders singing same old tune   * Rule is early test for new consumer financial agency   By Dave Clarke   WASHINGTON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - U.S. banks still wrestling with legal troubles springing from the subprime mortgage crisis are lobbying the new consumer agency for strong legal protection for future home loans.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is finalizing a proposal to entice banks to offer straightforward loans — without interest-only payments and excessive fees — by providing a legal shield. The question is whether to give banks full protection, known as a “safe harbor,” or a more limited legal shelter.   “It is critically important that the final rule provide a safe harbor,” Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) wrote in a July 22 letter. “If the final requirements instead increase the liability exposure of creditors ... the result will be increased costs and further reduction in credit availability to the very consumers that the reforms were designed to protect.”   The Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule on the matter earlier this year, but then punted it to the consumer agency, which now has jurisdiction. The agency, which was created by the Dodd-Frank oversight law, opened its doors on July 21.   This rule will be one of the first big tests of how tough the consumer agency will be on mortgage markets.   The proposal has already launched a flurry of letters from large banks such as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).   Those banks and others are hobbled by stalled foreclosures nationwide due to legal questions and multibillion-dollar lawsuits from investors such as American International Group Inc (AIG.N) that claim the quality of securities backing the mortgages was misrepresented.   The banks argue the safe harbor for future high-quality loans would promote lending and assure investors who buy mortgage-backed securities that legal battles are not on the horizon.   On the other side of the issue, consumer advocates charge banks want to take away one of the few legal tools available to borrowers who believe a lender pulled a fast one on them.   “The bureau’s position on this rule will be an indicator of its ability to work independently of the bank lobby,” said Alys Cohen, a staff attorney for consumer advocacy group the National Consumer Law Center.

The S&P 500 closed down 4.4 percent while BofA—the biggest U.S. bank—plummeted 10.9 percent and Citi was off 10.5 percent.  Goldman lost 10.1 percent of its value while Morgan Stanley shed 9.7 percent. Even JP Morgan, considered one of the most solid large institutions, fell 5.6 percent despite CEO James Dimon’s remarks on CNBC that his company is not worried about its exposure in Europe, where much of the market chaos began Wednesday.  The US stock market was dented by renewed fears of a global economic slowdown—which for banks can translate to curbed loan demand, reduced corporate appetite for growth through acquisition and reduced investor appetite for risk.  The decline for most bank stocks accelerated near Wednesday’s close, putting investors on alert for Thursday’s opening.  Trepidation about the European debt crisis spread to French banks on Wednesday, and had a spillover effect on US financial institutions.  Societe General, (SOGN.PA) which denied rumors it was on the brink of collapse, fell 21 percent and BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) lost 13 percent.  “Bank stocks tend to reflect investors’ outlook on the economy,” said Jason Goldberg, bank analyst at Barclays Capital. “Citi and BofA are two of the more global U.S. banks.”  Goldman and Morgan Stanley, the two major investment banks that converted to commercial bank corporate structures during the 2008 financial crisis, also proved sensitive to investor concerns that the global economy is in a prolonged slump.  “A downturn would mean in shift in business,” said Brad Hintz, a bank industry analyst at Bernstein Research who once worked at Morgan Stanley. “Equity capital markets cease, new M&A falls and the average retail investor dives back into a foxhole. This is bad for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.”  The Wednesday share drop follows a market rally for financial stocks on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve signaled at least two more years of near-zero interest rates. Bank of America shares rose 16 percent on Tuesday, after dropping 20 percent on Monday. Citi shares climbed 13 percent after a 16 percent drop the previous day.  Other banks also posted share price declines on Wednesday.  Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) shares lost 7.7 percent.  The KBW Bank Index .BKX of 24 stocks, including Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan, declined 8.2 percent.

104,WFC,"Obama, CEOs talk markets, global economy woes","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global financial upheaval was on the agenda on Friday when President Barack Obama met with top executives from the U.S. business community, the White House said.  Chief executives from Johnson & Johnson, Wells Fargo & Co, U.S. Bank, Xerox Corp, BlackRock Inc, Silver Lake Partners, American Express and U.S. Steel all met with Obama to discuss the economy and the president’s plans to create jobs.  Obama held his latest in a series of talks with Big Business against the backdrop of a euro zone debt crisis that has hit financial markets worldwide, adding to investor anxiety in the aftermath of last week’s U.S. credit downgrade.  Before Friday’s session which included major players from the financial sector, the White House said market turmoil and economic troubles around the world would be among the issues discussed, along with the U.S. economy and job creation.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest denied the meeting was called in reaction to market and global concerns but said: “They’ll certainly talk about these issues, about the market reaction here.”  The meeting came at the end of a volatile week. U.S. stocks rose on Friday as mildly upbeat retail sales data offset a closely watched barometer showing U.S. consumer sentiment at its lowest point in more than three decades.  European stock markets also gained despite continued concern about French banks’ exposure to European debt woes.  Critics have complained that Obama has failed to reassure Americans as markets whipsawed this week, in one of the most dramatic periods in the stock market since he took office amid the financial crisis in January 2009.  He said on Thursday that Europe’s debt troubles were among the global challenges weighing on the struggling U.S. recovery, but the White House said the administration remained confident in European leaders’ ability to handle the situation.  Obama’s hopes for re-election in 2012 will likely hinge on his success in lowering unemployment, currently pinned above 9 percent, boosting sluggish growth and restoring confidence lost from the Standard & Poor’s downgrade and fractious debt talks.  White House meetings with executives have become almost routine as Obama has courted business leaders while seeking to cast himself as more of a centrist.

108,WFC,UPDATE 3-HIGHLIGHTS-Some US hedge funds bail on Bank of America," (Adds George Soros and Maverick Capital)    NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Investors and traders started to get a glimpse on Monday of how some of Wall Street’s savviest stock pickers positioned themselves before the summer’s rout.   John Paulson, Dinakar Singh and David Tepper were heavy sellers of Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) in the second quarter, eliminating or cutting their exposure before the financial giant’s recent woes.   But Paulson’s move to cut his stake in BofA nearly in half was not enough to prevent his flagship funds from declining as much as 30 percent for the year through the first week of August, investor sources have said.   Eric Mindich’s Eton Park Capital appeared prescient in eliminating his holdings of some of the world’s gold mining companies, which delivered mixed returns even as the metal itself soared.   Paulson was the day’s most closely watched filer because of the poor performance in his funds this year and traders were looking to see how much he reduced his stakes in several beaten-down financial stocks. The billionaire investor was less nimble in the gold market, where his large holding of the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) remained unchanged — reaping some but not all of the potential rewards there.   George Soros, however, reduced his exposure in the gold exchange-traded fund.   “Oracle of Omaha” Warren Buffett made some small moves in his portfolio, adding to one favorite and cutting back on another long-time holding.   Top hedge-fund managers disclosed their second quarter U.S. equity holdings in so-called 13-Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The deadline for these quarterly filings was on Aug. 15.   The filings show which managers began scaling back positions that came under fire in recent weeks — the managers who therefore best weathered the turmoil.   Financial stocks had been a favorite with big investors betting on a recovery in the United States, but some investors got cold feet earlier this year — which turned out to be a good idea.   Another good idea, which may have saved the day for some firms, was holding metals. Gold streaked higher as investors worried about Europe’s debt crisis, the U.S. economic recovery and whether the United States would raise its debt ceiling or ratings agencies would downgrade countries’ debt.   Here are highlights of some of the moves in and out of stocks and sectors that fund managers made during the second quarter:   Based on his filing, TPG-Axon Management’s Dinakar Singh eliminated his positions in Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N).   David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management, which had earned billions by buying battered down financial stocks, nearly halved his holding in Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) to 10 million shares while also trimming his position in Citigroup Inc (C.N).   Thomas Steyer’s Farallon took a different tack, boosting its holdings in Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) to 3.4 million shares from 2.7 million shares at the end of March. Also, Buffett raised his Wells Fargo stake by a little more than 1 percent.   Because Wells Fargo had less exposure to mortgage problems, some investors considered it a good way to diversify.   Farallon also upped its holdings in trust bank State Street Corp (STT.N) to 3.1 million shares from 2.9 million shares at the end of March.   In the financial area, Eton Park Capital stuck by its bets and kept its positions in JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Bank of American unchanged.   But Mindich’s Eton Park Capital, which had invested heavily in gold and mining companies, slashed his SPDR Gold Trust position, which had been his second-largest holding, to 813,000 shares from 2.3 million shares, possibly missing some of the gains from gold’s recent run-up. He also eliminated mining companies Kinross Gold Corp, Goldcorp Inc, Gold Fields Ltd and Barrick Gold, which have delivered mixed performances this year.   Soros, one of the hedge fund industry’s most successful investors over decades, also further reduced his holdings in gold by cutting the SPDR Gold Trust by 13.4 percent to 42,800 shares.   Jana Partners upped its holding in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and added a new position in Google Inc (GOOG.O) with 127,894 shares.   Coatue Management trimmed its stake in Google to 467,918 from 583,180 shares. Meanwhile, Maverick Capital, according to its filing, eliminated a stake in Google during the second quarter. The hedge fund previously reported owning 478,519 Class A shares.   Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) found a little more love from David Einhorn, who made a splash earlier this year by demanding that Microsoft oust its CEO, Steve Ballmer. His Greenlight Capital hedge fund raised its holdings of the software giant by 63 percent to 14.8 million. It had already been the fifth-largest holding for Greenlight.   Farallon, however, trimmed its holdings of Microsoft to 3.2 million shares from 3.6 million shares at the end of March.   Dan Loeb, one of the $2 trillion industry’s biggest winners in the last months, clearly liked energy producers, and raised El Paso EP.N, which has been a winner this year, to 13 million shares from 11 million shares. Loeb also raised CVR Energy (CVI.N), another big gainer this year, to own 7.3 million at the end of the quarter, up from 6.3 million shares. But he slashed his third biggest holding, Williams Energy (WMB.N), which gained this year but not as much as the other two, by 76 percent.   The portfolio at Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway continued to be dominated by the likes of Coca Cola Co (KO.N) and Kraft KFT.N, but he trimmed his Kraft holdings by more than 5 percent. Buffett, while backing Kraft’s split, has been critical of the company over the last two years and has steadily cut that stake.   Berkshire Hathaway also reported new positions in retailer Dollar General (DG.N) and financial research and data company Verisk Analytics (VRSK.O), which may reflect the influence of the recently hired investment manager Todd Combs.   Jana, as previously reported, more than doubled its stake in McGraw-Hill MHP.N, possibly with an eye to breaking up the family-owned business that oversees ratings agency Standard & Poors. Jana owned 7.7 million shares at the end of the second quarter and more recently said it met with McGraw-Hill to discuss the business.   News Corp (NWSA.O), embroiled in an image-tarnishing telephone hacking scandal, remains a big holding for Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group as he kept the position steady at about 19 million shares.

110,WFC,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo hires Citadel investment bankers," * Wells snaps up team from hedge fund   * Move comes as Citadel sheds non-core operations  (Adds league tables, other employees hired)   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss   NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) said on Monday that it has hired 25 investment bankers and administrative staff from Citadel after the hedge fund abandoned plans to build out its investment banking unit.   Wells said the group included Brian Maier, who had headed investment banking at Citadel and will be a vice chairman of client coverage for the bank.   The announcement comes less than a week after the Chicago-based hedge fund, which oversees roughly $11 trillion, shuttered its stock research operation and indicated that it was shedding non-core operations.   The former Citadel staffers will complement Wells’ existing team and will help beef up the company’s investment banking practice that it purchased when it bought rival Wachovia, executives said.   In league tables, Wells ranks as No. 17 for the year-to-date in capital markets underwriting, trailing industry leaders JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank. For mergers and acquisitions, Wells ranks as No. 40, behind industry leaders Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.   “Citadel has assembled a strong team of investment bankers with a solid array of skills and relationships,” said Jonathan Weiss, Wells’ co-head of Investment Banking and Capital Markets. “Their addition to Wells Fargo is consistent with our strategy to grow our business in a focused, disciplined and profitable manner that provides excellent service and capabilities to our clients,” he said in a statement.   In addition to Maier, Wells has hired Stephen Gerson, Aviv Laurence, Paul Pepe, Stavros Tsibiridis, Jim Broner, Scott Heberton and Jim Sigman.   Late last weeks news filtered out that Citadel was abandoning plans to build an investment bank to rival East Coast heavyweights Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.   The planned buildout coincided with the financial crisis and never gained much traction, in part, because people were unwilling to do this kind of business with a hedge fund.   After being badly damaged by the financial crisis when Citadel’s main funds lost more than 50 percent, the firm refocused on its core activities. Last week the firm closed down its stock research operation.   Both the investment advisory services and stock research were part of Citadel Securities, which also includes electronic trading and options market-making. The businesses, which are more closely connected to the firm’s main investment management operations, continue to operate.   This year, Citadel’s main hedge funds have delivered top returns, rising 14 percent through the first week in August, investors in the funds said.

The move comes as the Chicago-based hedge fund, which oversees roughly $11 trillion, is working to shed non-core operations and Wells is trying to build out its capital markets business.   “Citadel has assembled a strong team of investment bankers with a solid array of skills and relationships,” said Jonathan Weiss, Wells’ co-head of Investment Banking and Capital Markets. “Their addition to Wells Fargo is consistent with our strategy to grow our business in a focused, disciplined and profitable manner that provides excellent service and capabilities to our clients,” he said in a statement.   Maier will become Vice Chairman in Client Coverage at Wells Fargo while Stephen Gerson will be a senior banker in the Financial Technologies practice. Jim Broner will head technology, media and telecom investment banking while Scott Heberton and Jim Sigman will be co-heads of Financial Institutions Investment Banking, Wells Fargo said.   Late last weeks news filtered out that Chicago-based Citadel was abandoning plans to build an investment bank to rival East Coast heavyweights Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.   Citadel’s  planned buildout coincided with the financial crisis and never gained much traction, in part, because people were unwilling to do this kind of business with a hedge fund.   After being badly damaged by the financial crisis when Citadel’s main funds lost more than 50 percent, the firm refocused on its core activities. Last week the firm closed down its stock research operation.   Both the investment advisory services and stock research were part of Citadel Securities, which also includes electronic trading and options market-making. The businesses, which are more closely connected to the firm’s main investment management operations, continue to operate.   This year, Citadel’s main hedge funds have delivered top returns, rising 14 percent through the first week in August, investors in the funds said.   For Wells the move will help the bank move closer to its goals of expanding its capital markets business.

112,WFC,Extended Stay creditors file amended complaint against lenders," Aug 15 (Reuters) - A trust representing creditors of the bankrupt hotel chain Extended Stay America Inc has filed a complaint against Lightstone Holdings and other parties to avoid obligations arising from the loans made by them to fund the 2007 leveraged buyout (LBO) of the hotel chain.	   Blackstone Group LP in 2007 sold the chain of about 680 hotels for $8 billion to little-known private equity investor David Lichtenstein, the sole managing member of Lightstone Holdings. 	   The amended complaint filed on Friday in Manhattan’s bankruptcy court is also seeking to recover funds to benefit creditors who lost money in the bankruptcy.	   The complaint also names Bank of America , which funded the buyout. 	   “The initial lenders ... knew or should have known that the LBO would leave the company inadequately capitalized and that the mezzanine debt they were creating would be underwater from the start,” the complaint says.

114,WFC,UPDATE 2-Paulson slashes stake in Bank of America," * Paulson cuts Bank of America stake   * Sticks with SPDR Gold Trust  (Adds details on other holdings, Paulson’s investment style, background, bylines)   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Ashley Lau   NEW YORK, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor John Paulson, whose flagship funds are down some 30 percent for the year to date, cut back on one of his biggest holdings but largely kept the other major holdings unchanged.   Weeks after telling investors in July that he had been overly aggressive with some of his calls, Paulson showed the world that he began scaling back and diversifying within the financial sector during the second quarter.   At the end of June Paulson owned 60.4 million shares in Bank of America (BAC.N), down from 124 million at the end of the first quarter.   Paulson had told investors on that rare conference call in July that he was surprised by the size of Bank of America’s mortgage problems and said he would be shifting money into financial companies with fewer problems.   He had already begun to do so.   In the second quarter he raised his stake in Wells Fargo (WFC.N) to 33.6 million shares from 20.5 million shares and lifted his stake in Capital One (COF.N) to 21.1 million shares from 18 million shares. [nN1E7780AL]   While Paulson was clearly adjusting some holdings, the moves were too small to save his roughly $35 billion fund firm from the battering it endured over the last few weeks as Bank of America’s stock price declined further. In the last three months the company’s shares have tumbled 41.07 percent.   Paulson is known for making big bets and sticking with them often for very long periods.   On Aug. 11 Reuters wrote in a Special Report [nN1E7780AL] that some hedge fund industry analysts and investors were beginning to worry that Paulson’s Advantage funds, his two largest portfolios, were too large and taking mutual-fund style bets on too many stocks.   One thing that has helped Paulson is that his firm has kept its stake in the SPDR Gold Trust unchanged at 31.5 million. It is the firm’s biggest holding and one of its most profitable given the surge in gold prices,   The funds’ holdings of Hartford Financial Services Group (HIG.N), Paulson’s seventh largest holding, were cut to 40.5 million shares from 43.9 million shares. His holdings of SunTrust Banks (STI.N) were reduced to 32.1 million shares from 34.3 million shares. And he trimmed his MGM Resorts International (MGM.N) holdings to 41.7 million shares from 43.8 million shares.   AngloGold Ashanti AU_pa.N, Paulson’s second biggest position, weighed in at 39.9 million shares, down only slightly from 41 million shares.   In the past, especially when he bet against the overheated U.S. housing market, Paulson’s ability to spot trends early and stick with them has paid off big for himself and investors.   This time around though some investors are beginning to worry that Paulson has lost his magic touch, particularly now that the economy is not recovering as quickly as he initially forecast.

115,WFC,Senator Grassley probes document destruction at SEC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. senator is asking securities regulators for answers after an internal whistleblower alleged the Securities and Exchange Commission has destroyed over 9,000 investigation-related records.  Senator Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter on Wednesday asking SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro about the alleged destruction of so-called “matters under inquiry.” MUIs are preliminary documents the SEC compiles when it receives evidence of possible securities violations.  In his letter, Grassley says that Darcy Flynn, a 13-year veteran of the SEC, had alerted him to the problem.  Flynn told Grassley the SEC has destroyed files on important, high-profile cases including Bernard Madoff, Goldman Sachs trading in AIG credit-default swaps, alleged frauds at Wells Fargo and Bank of America, and insider-trading probes at Deutsche Bank, Lehman Brothers and the hedge fund SAC Capital.  “From what I’ve seen, it looks as if the SEC might have sanctioned some level of case-related document destruction,” Grassley said in a statement.  “It doesn’t make sense that an agency responsible for investigations would want to get rid of potential evidence. If these charges are true, the agency needs to explain why it destroyed documents, how many documents it destroyed over what timeframe, and to what extent its actions were consistent with the law.”  SEC spokesman John Nester said that the agency does retain records of its matters under inquiry, but noted that “not every document that comes into an agency’s possession in the course of its work must be retained.” He declined to comment further in advance of the SEC’s response to Grassley.  In his letter, Grassley asks the SEC to discuss whether it routinely destroys documents and what its legal obligations are to retain certain records.  He asked to receive the information by the end of the month.  ",8172011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-grassley/senator-grassley-probes-document-destruction-at-sec-idUSTRE77G66120110817

118,WFC,BofA weighs foreclosure deal: report,"(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp may settle a state and federal probe of foreclosure practices in a deal that lets New York proceed with an inquiry into securitizations, Bloomberg reported citing two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  The firm may pursue an accord with most of the 50 state attorneys general, even if it omits New York’s attorney general Eric Schneiderman, said one of the people, Bloomberg reported.  BofA did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment outside regular U.S. business hours.  The company executives, concerned that a delay in resolving the case is hurting the firm’s stock, are open to a deal that would resolve most of it, even if some mortgage investigations continue, said one of the people.  In late June, BofA agreed to an $8.5 billion deal to settle an eight-month dispute with outside investors who bought Countrywide Financial Corp mortgage bonds. The deal, which must be approved by a New York court, applies to all investors in nearly all Countrywide Financial-created mortgage bonds.  The investors — including Pacific Investment Management Co, or PIMCO, and BlackRock Inc — requested the bank repurchase toxic home loans that comprised a series of mortgage-backed securities.  Schneiderman has said in court papers that the proposed settlement was “both procedurally and substantively flawed.” He and Delaware attorney general Beau Biden, both Democrats, have ongoing investigations into the mortgage system.  Negotiations with regulators and the five largest mortgage servicers including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo & Co and Ally Financial Inc have been bogged down over details of the proposed deal, people with knowledge of the talks told Bloomberg.

Lynch   WASHINGTON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission violated federal rules when it destroyed investigative records over a 17-year period, the agency that safeguards federal documents said on Thursday.   “The SEC did not have the authority to dispose of them per the Federal Records Act,” the National Archives said in a statement to the press.   The National Archives added that the SEC has since mended its ways, although it still has lingering concerns that “the SEC has been slow” in creating record schedules to determine how long the data must be retained on file.   The findings by the National Archives come after Darcy Flynn, a 13-year-veteran of the SEC, decided to blow the whistle after learning the SEC had destroyed over 9,000 “matters under inquiry,” or MUIs. MUIs are preliminary documents the SEC compiles when it receives evidence of possible securities violations.   In a letter Flynn sent to Senator Charles Grassley, he claimed the SEC destroyed files on important, high-profile cases, including Bernard Madoff, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), trading in American International Group Inc (AIG.N) credit-default swaps, alleged frauds at Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and insider-trading probes at Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), Lehman Brothers and hedge fund SAC Capital.   Grassley sent a letter to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro on Wednesday asking questions about the document destruction.   Separately, SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz said his office has also been probing the document destruction and plans to issue the findings of his investigation by the end of September.   “We maintain records of our inquiries and they are available to investigators across the agency,” SEC spokesman John Nester said in a statement. “As NARA notes, it works with federal agencies on a regular basis to resolve allegations and we are committed to that process.”   (Reporting by Sarah N.

122,WFC,"Bank of America shares fall amid legal, capital woes","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) shares fell nearly 8 percent on Monday, reaching their lowest level since March 2009, as investors fretted the bank may need to raise some $50 billion of capital and worried about potential additional mortgage lawsuit payouts.  The cost of insuring the company’s debt against default also jumped.  In a note to clients, a Jefferies strategist outlined how much capital Bank of America would need to raise to meet new requirements.  The strategist did not determine exactly how likely a capital raise was, but said the market seems to be bracing for a stock raise and looked at how different issuance prices would affect earnings per share. The worst case scenario Jefferies considered was a $52.4 billion capital raise. Bank of America’s market value was about $65 billion on Monday.  Bank of America is widely seen as needing to boost capital to meet upcoming requirements under the new Basel III rules. The bank has said repeatedly it can meet its new requirements through earning more money, but many investors believe generating enough earnings could be difficult.  “The odds are higher that they’ll have to do a new capital raise, and a dividend increase is out of the realm of possibility in the near term,” said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati.  In a conference call, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said the bank issued so many new shares during the financial crisis that it does not view selling common equity as an option.  The bank may benefit from the fact regulators could phase in new rules over years, giving banks time to boost capital levels, CreditSights analysts wrote in a note on Monday.  But one possible source of capital may not give as much of a benefit as investors hoped, the CreditSights analysts said.  If Bank of America sold its stake in China Construction Bank (0939.HK), it would only boost its Basel III tier 1 common ratio by 0.1 percentage point, because of the way the bank accounts for the stake, they said. As of the second quarter, that ratio stood at 6.6 percent. Systemically important banks may need capital levels of more than 9 percent.  CCB said on Monday its relationship with Bank of America remains strong and it is in talks with the U.S. bank to extend its cooperation for another five years.  Bank of America's shares, which fell 55 cents to $6.42, were the worst performers in the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX on Monday. Since the beginning of August, the bank's shares have lost some 35 percent of their value, erasing about $35 billion of market value.  The cost of protecting its debt against default jumped 49 basis points to 380 basis points, or $380,000 a year for five years, for every $10 million of debt protected in the credit derivatives market, according to financial data provider Markit.  Slowing economic growth could weigh on Bank of America’s earnings, making it harder for the bank to boost its capital levels, analysts have said.  Legal liabilities linked to mortgages could also pressure the bank. The bank agreed to an $8.5 billion settlement with a group of mortgage bond investors in June. That agreement is subject to court approval and multiple parties have objected to it.  The bank has agreed to other settlements over mortgages and is in the midst of negotiating one now with federal and state officials. A report in the Wall Street Journal on Monday said government officials are clashing with banks over how wide-ranging their legal settlements over mortgages should be.  Banks, including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), are looking to be released from a wide array of potential litigation linked to mortgages in exchange for paying penalties of $20 billion to $25 billion, the newspaper reported. Government officials are looking for narrower releases.  Investors had hoped banks could negotiate this settlement and be much closer to ending their legal problems from mortgages, but that may have been too optimistic, investors said.  “They could still have people coming after them, even after this settlement,” said one analyst at a hedge fund.  Much of Bank of America’s mortgage problems come from its $2.5 billion acquisition of Countrywide in mid 2008.  Countrywide was at one point the largest U.S. mortgage lender.

126,WFC,Bank of America leads U.S. bank shares lower,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp shares fell as much as 6.6 percent on Monday, reaching their lowest level in two weeks, as investors fretted about the bank facing additional legal liabilities over mortgages.  Bank of America’s shares staged the biggest decline among the major U.S. bank stocks, and helped bring a broad measure of the banking sector down to its lowest level since July 2009.  A report in the Wall Street Journal on Monday said that U.S. federal and state officials are clashing with banks over how wide-ranging their legal settlements over mortgages should be.  Banks including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase & Co are looking to be released from a wide array of potential litigation linked to mortgages in exchange for paying penalties of $20 billion to $25 billion, the paper reported. Government officials are looking for more narrower releases.  Investors had hoped that banks could negotiate this settlement and be much closer to ending their legal problems from mortgages, but that may have been too optimistic, investors said.  “They could still have people coming after them, even after this settlement,” said one analyst at a hedge fund.  Bank of America shares fell in early afternoon trading by 5.6 percent or 39 cents, to $6.58, on track to reach their lowest close since August 8, which was in turn their lowest close since March 2009. The bank’s shares fell as low as $6.51 on Monday.  JPMorgan shares fell 1.8 percent to $33.72. Overall, bank stocks as measured by the KBW Bank Index fell 0.11 percent.

127,WFC,First Allied to split off from Advanced Equities," * First Allied to spin off from Advanced Securities   * Terms of the deal were not disclosed   * Deal is latest in the independent brokerage business   By Joseph A. Giannone   NEW YORK, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Advanced Equities Financial Corp is selling First Allied Securities Inc to the independent brokerage’s management in a deal financed by Lovell Minnick Partners, the firms said on Monday.   San Diego-based First Allied said it will keep its name and executive officers, while not changing its day to day operations. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. Terms were not disclosed.   First Allied, founded in 1994, employs about 1,000 financial advisers in 500 branches across the United States. Advanced Equities, which acquired the firm from Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) in 2005, makes late stage investments in companies.   The sale comes as deal activity heats up in the brokerage industry. It also reflects rising expectations for the independent broker-dealer business, which has been growing at a much faster rate than traditional Wall Street and regional brokerages.   Last week Ladenburg Thalmann (LTS.A) agreed to acquire Securities America, one of the country’s 10 largest independent brokerages, from Ameriprise Financial (AMP.N) for $150 million. Earlier this month, Investors Capital Holdings ICH.A founder sold his controlling stake in a deal that put the firm in the hands of its 500 advisers.   Commercial bank Regions Financial (RF.N), meanwhile, is narrowing down a field of bidders for its Morgan Keegan.  (Reporting by Joseph A.

128,WFC,Analysis: Eurozone bank doubts worse for lack of deposits,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - European banks like Societe Generale (SOGN.PA) and Dexia SA (DEXI.BR) are reeling from bad loans, but they are also suffering from a less obvious problem: their reliance on bond markets to fund operations.  Unlike U.S. banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), which fund a greater percentage of their loans using deposits, investor-owned banks in Europe generally depend more on borrowing in the short-term capital markets.  That leaves the European banks exposed to the vagaries of bond investors, who might suddenly demand much higher rates for their money or take it all back and put a bank at the mercy of a government for a bailout  Spikes in short-term rates for some European banks in recent weeks have raised fears of just that kind of meltdown.  European bank shares tumbled as scared stock investors remembered 2008 when Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers fell because of lack of ready funds to meet their obligations.  The turmoil points to the need for vulnerable European banks to shrink their loan books to sizes more in line with what their deposits can support, or increase their deposit base. Analysts are also calling for more disclosure from the banks around their funding profiles.  “European banking has to be rethought and recapitalized,” said one New York-based institutional investor in the money markets who declined to be named because of the risk of alienating clients.  These banks find themselves in a corner. Since the 2008 financial crisis, many have been trying hard to raise more deposits, but it is proving to be tough.  Deposits for investor-owned banks are more difficult to collect in Europe, where banks owned by local governments or by depositors have tax and cost advantages and a stranglehold on the market, said Michigan State University professor Rocco Huang.  Competition for deposits has driven up costs, especially in Spain.  Some banks are looking abroad. Dexia has branched into Turkey to get deposits, but one analyst said that might not be sustainable.  The history of booming countries shows that such new money is unlikely to be as dependable as deposits in long-established accounts, said Morningstar bank analyst Erin Davis.  Dexia declined to comment.  At Paris-based Societe Generale, loans are 1.2 times as much as deposits, according to data compiled by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Dexia, the Franco-Belgian bank headquartered in Brussels, has 2.5 times as much money out on loan as it has in deposits.  At New York-based JPMorgan in comparison, loans use only two-thirds of the money the bank holds in customer deposits.  To make up the shortfalls, European banks rely on capital markets, including short-term money markets, which can be risky at times of uncertainty like now. (For graphic, please click on r.reuters.com/mez33s )  “In the funding markets, people tend to shoot first and ask questions later,” said Mark Pawlak, a strategist and senior vice president at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. “There’s a certain amount of that going on now.”  Credit default swaps, a kind of insurance against default, on Societe General more than doubled to 303 basis points on August 19 from the 138 points on May 31, according to Markit.  The bank’s stock lost 49 percent of its value in the same time. Meanwhile, JPMorgan credit default swaps rose to just 125 basis points from 75 and its stock fell 21 percent.  The downdrafts came as big U.S.-based money market funds quit rolling over billions of dollars of short-term loans to European banks.  In June and July, the 10 biggest funds took back 18.4 percent, or $70 billion, of the money they had lent to European banks, according to Fitch Ratings.  In a sign of how connected global finance is now, many of the funds said they backed out because they needed money in case investors wanted to cash out in the face of a U.S. government default rather than over worries about European banks. The U.S. funds still had 47 percent of their holdings in European bank instruments at the end of July.  Still, the retreat of the money market funds forced the banks to replace their dollars, which stressed prices in the dollar-funding markets in a way that suggested that some institutions have had trouble getting funds, said Pawlak.  The problem is exacerbated because these banks do not clearly and consistently disclose their liquidity positions, leaving investors to use inadequate proxies such as ratios of loans to deposits and adding to the uncertainty about their health, analysts said.  Societe Generale tried to quell fears by giving more details from its balance sheet in an investor presentation on August 3.  This past weekend, Chief Executive Frederic Oudea said in an interview in the newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche: “The bank does not have any liquidity problems. Its operations are healthy and its investment resources are intact.”  A Societe Generale spokesman declined to comment further for this story.

129,WFC,"U.S. bank earnings up, FDIC questions for how long","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. bank earnings continue to increase but the prospects for earnings growth are dimming as banks are having trouble boosting revenue.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said on Tuesday that the industry earned $28.8 billion in the second quarter, a $7.9 billion increase from a year before.  That number is down slightly from the $28.9 billion in earnings recorded during the first quarter.  The agency again warned that earnings increases are mostly due to banks setting aside less to guard against losses from bad loans.  “As the levels of loss provisions approach their historic norms, the prospects of earnings improvement from further reductions in provisions diminish,” FDIC Acting Chairman Martin Gruenberg said at a news conference on the release of the agency’s quarterly banking report.  The industry set aside $19 billion during the second quarter to guard against losses, which is 53 percent less than a year ago, according to the FDIC.  Bank revenues continue to fall.  During the second quarter net operating revenues fell $3 billion, or 1.8 percent, from the levels recorded a year ago, the agency said.  In a positive sign for the industry, bank loan balances grew during the second quarter for the first time in three years, up $64.4 billion, or 0.9 percent.  Gruenberg highlighted the increase but added a note of caution.  “A significant portion of the overall growth in loans represented intra-company lending between related banks,” he said. “Lending activity still has a long way to go before it approaches more normal levels.”  The report covers the 7,513 banks for which the FDIC provides deposit insurance.  An official with the American Bankers Association said the quarterly report shows the banking industry is strong and that robust loan growth will come when the overall economy improves.  “Loan demand is still extraordinarily weak and the uncertainty that has been created by the last several months has frozen business decisions,” said Jim Chessen, chief economist at the ABA.  The KBW Bank Index .BKX of stocks is down about 33 percent this year as investors fear a sputtering U.S. economic recovery and contagion from the European debt crisis.  Shares in Bank of America, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, have lost more than 50 percent of their value this year. Its shares were down as much as 6.4 percent on Tuesday due to concerns about possible write-offs and capital raises.  There was evidence in the report of how the industry continues to recover from the doldrums of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.  The number of banks on the agency’s “problem list” fell for the first time in 19 quarters, dropping to 865 in the second quarter from 888 in the first quarter. There have been 68 bank failures so far this year, mainly small institutions.  The deposit insurance fund that the FDIC uses to cover the cost of failed banks moved into positive territory for the first time in two years.  At the end of the second quarter, the fund stood at positive $3.9 billion, improving on a negative $1 billion at the end of the first quarter.  The amount of deposits being held at banks grew, according to the FDIC report, as skittish investors seek a safe place to park their funds.  The FDIC said that deposits grew by $234.4 billion, or 2.9 percent, during the second quarter. That number is likely to stay elevated during the third quarter given the market volatility in recent months.  “Money would not be flowing there if the public did not believe the industry was strong and the FDIC is strong,” Chessen said.

133,WFC,Analysis: Mortgage probe split puts banks in tactical bind,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Large U.S. banks defending themselves against a mass of state and federal mortgage probes face a difficult tactical decision following New York state’s exit from settlement talks on Tuesday.  A settlement with the states remaining at the negotiating table and their partner federal agencies may be easier to strike, and could give skittish investors a sense of the size of banks’ liability.  But a partial deal would leave open the question of whether the more aggressive attorneys general will be able to extract their own massive settlements, analysts and industry lawyers said.  “The banks (have) got to be thinking what is the benefit of a deal with Iowa when New York and Massachusetts can still come after them,” said a lawyer close to the process who asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the talks.  Federal regulators and state AGs have been investigating bank mortgage and foreclosure practices that came to light last year, including the use of “robo-signers” to sign hundreds of unread foreclosure documents a day.  States and the departments of Justice and Housing and Urban Development have been negotiating for months with Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Ally Financial.  The uncertainty over banks’ mortgage-related exposures has weighed heavily on their stocks. The KBW Bank Index of stocks is down about 30 percent this year. Shares in Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank by assets, are down about 50 percent.  A focus of the settlement talks is what type of legal protections banks will get for agreeing to change their practices and for paying a combined penalty of possibly around $20 billion.  The contentious issue has caused fissures within the block of states dealing with the banks.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has insisted that any deal should not preclude states from pursuing further cases against the banks related to their mortgage practices.  Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, the states’ lead negotiator, announced on Tuesday that Schneiderman had been booted from the committee working on the deal.  Miller said in a statement that in recent weeks “New York has actively worked to undermine” the multi-state groups work because of differences with how to proceed.  Schneiderman’s office said he will continue to pursue a “comprehensive resolution” to mortgage problems.  New York could still sign on to a final deal negotiated by Miller’s team, although that seems unlikely at the moment.  Analysts said Schneiderman’s departure shows the remaining states, along with their partner federal agencies, are eager to strike a deal. It also could mean the settlement figure would be lower because fewer states may take part in the agreement, although government negotiators will fight to prevent it from dropping too much.  Guggenheim Securities LLC analyst Marty Mosby said even a more limited deal would likely help the banks because it would provide more certainty about the size and scope of the liabilities they face. “We go from guestimating to estimating,” Mosby said. “The range of possibilities begins to narrow and you can get more comfortable.”  A partial settlement may also help banks in their dealings with aggressive AGs like Schneiderman.  Gilbert Schwartz, partner at Schwartz & Ballen LLP and a former Federal Reserve lawyer who is not involved in the negotiations, said lenders could point to the settlement as a precedent both during negotiations with Schneiderman and in court.  “If he has to go his own way, the banks are just going to get their backs up and fight him,” Schwartz said.

136,WFC,"Wealth managers lost 14,000 advisers in 2010: report","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. wealth management industry is shrinking, losing legions of advisers, just as demand for their services is on the rise.  The ranks of brokers and investment advisers working at brokerages, banks, insurers and independent firms fell by nearly 14,000, or 4.1 percent, last year, according to the latest Cerulli Associates report that tracks the movement of people and assets among U.S. firms.  Meanwhile the four largest brokerages — Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo Advisors and UBS Wealth Management Americas — are losing advisers and clients to independent broker-dealers and investment advisers, according to Cerulli.  That means Wall Street’s big firms, which for years have been paying up to recruit star brokers from each other, are likely in for bigger bills, Cerulli analyst Bing Waldert said.  Industry-wide, “the adviser population hasn’t been growing for some time, and its shrinkage accelerated in 2010,” said Waldert, co-author of the widely followed report.  The decline in headcount, following years of stagnation, partly reflects an adviser population nearing retirement age.

Banks and other parts of the wealth management industry employed about 320,000 advisers as of the end of last year, little changed for seven years.

Last year, self-employed advisers represented 41 percent of the industry’s headcount, up from 37 percent in 2004. The RIA channel has grown by 6.7 percent over the past three years, as growing numbers of investors seek advisers who are not paid based on trades and product sales.

RIAs by the same token will boost their share by 2.5 points to reach 14 percent.  Independent broker-dealers, lately a hotbed of acquisition activity, are expected to boost their market share by 2 points to 18 percent of assets over the next few years, Cerulli said.  Executives at the big brokerages play down the breakaway trend as overblown. Indeed, they command twice as many assets as independent brokers, the runner-up group.  Still, the big guys face a difficult task of increasing their sales forces and retaining their market position.  “The industry has to figure out how to productively bring new talent into the industry,” Waldert said. “People don’t come to the wirehouses from other channels.

137,WFC,"REFILE-Wealth managers lost 14,000 advisers in 2010-report"," (Refiles to fix video link.)   By Joseph A. Giannone   NEW YORK, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. wealth management industry is shrinking, losing legions of advisers, just as demand for their services is on the rise.   The ranks of brokers and investment advisers working at brokerages, banks, insurers and independent firms fell by nearly 14,000, or 4.1 percent, last year, according to the latest Cerulli Associates report that tracks the movement of people and assets among U.S. firms.   Meanwhile the four largest brokerages — Morgan Stanley Smith Barney (MS.N), Bank of America’s (BAC.N) Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo Advisors (WFC.N) and UBS Wealth Management Americas UBSN.VX — are losing advisers and clients to independent broker-dealers and investment advisers, according to Cerulli.   That means Wall Street’s big firms, which for years have been paying up to recruit star brokers from each other, are likely in for bigger bills, Cerulli analyst Bing Waldert said.   Industry-wide, “the adviser population hasn’t been growing for some time, and its shrinkage accelerated in 2010,” said Waldert, co-author of the widely followed report.   The decline in headcount, following years of stagnation, partly reflects an adviser population nearing retirement age. It also reveals the shake-out of laggard brokers and advisers whose livelihoods have been hurt since the financial crisis.   Banks and other parts of the wealth management industry employed about 320,000 advisers as of the end of last year, little changed for seven years.

AG wins plaudits in mortgage probe","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York attorney general’s booting from a panel of state officials negotiating a settlement of mortgage abuses may shore up his political base and enforcement agenda.  Eric Schneiderman’s resistance to a possible $25 billion settlement being negotiated with the largest mortgage servicers has already drawn praise from groups representing minorities and organized labor.  “Anybody who takes on the banks is a hero,” political consultant Hank Sheinkopf said. “Whether he gets anything done is another story. In politics, it’s not what you do, it’s how you do it.”  On Tuesday, Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller announced the removal of Schneiderman from the committee of state officials that has been working with federal agencies to address “robosigning” and other shortcuts that banks took in their haste to remove borrowers from their homes.  The states and the departments of Justice and Housing and Urban Development have been negotiating for months with Bank of America (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), Citigroup (C.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and Ally Financial.  Miller said Schneiderman “actively worked to undermine” the state coalition. The New York Times has reported that federal officials pressured Schneiderman to drop his opposition.  The New York attorney general, a Democrat, has objected to any agreement that gives banks a broad release from claims by investors who bought securities backed by home loans that soured.  A spokesperson for Schneiderman said he is “committed to a comprehensive resolution that will provide homeowners meaningful relief to stay in their homes, allow the housing market to begin to recover, and get our economy moving again.”  On Wednesday, a day after Miller announced his removal, Schneiderman won support for his stance from a variety of national and state organizations, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations.  In a letter to government officials leading the mortgage investigation, including Miller, they said the group should not be pressured into a deal that does not adequately address the harm done.  “We understand that industry is pressuring to limit relief and for overly broad releases; they must not be allowed to succeed,” they said. “To the extent that institutions or individuals committed illegal acts, there have to be consequences for breaking the law that are in proportion to the seriousness of the violations.”  Some government officials would prefer to have a deal soon that could provide relief to homeowners and stabilize the housing market.  But the public may not view Schneiderman as an obstructionist.  “Most of the people aren’t going to see it that way,” said Sheinkopf. “They’re going to see it as ‘good guy takes on big banks’.”  Schneiderman took office in January and is up for re-election in November 2014.  Eliot Spitzer, a former New York attorney general known for his successes in fighting Wall Street, said it is “beyond frivolous” to suggest that Schneiderman is causing delays.  Spitzer blamed the federal government for years of lax regulation, and not driving a harder bargain with banks.  “They have given the banks everything they wanted and gotten nothing back,” he said. “Eric Schneiderman is properly demanding negotiating position and requiring the banks to disclose more, to leave them open to inquiries related to areas that have not been sufficiently investigated before signing onto a broad waiver.”  New York had last October been named to join an executive committee leading the state coalition.  Miller said he invited Schneiderman’s office in June to be part of a smaller negotiating committee, but Schneiderman declined, indicating he “would possibly pursue a different direction.”  Josh Rosner, an independent financial services consultant at Graham Fisher & Co, said Schneiderman’s being dropped from the committee may have little impact.  “To have a 50-state settlement, Schneiderman’s concerns are going to have to be addressed,” he said.

141,WFC,Analysis: Mortgage probe split puts banks in tactical bind,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Large U.S. banks defending themselves against a mass of state and federal mortgage probes face a difficult tactical decision following New York state’s exit from settlement talks on Tuesday.  A settlement with the states remaining at the negotiating table and their partner federal agencies may be easier to strike, and could give skittish investors a sense of the size of banks’ liability.  But a partial deal would leave open the question of whether the more aggressive attorneys general will be able to extract their own massive settlements, analysts and industry lawyers said.  “The banks (have) got to be thinking what is the benefit of a deal with Iowa when New York and Massachusetts can still come after them,” said a lawyer close to the process who asked not to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the talks.  Federal regulators and state AGs have been investigating bank mortgage and foreclosure practices that came to light last year, including the use of “robo-signers” to sign hundreds of unread foreclosure documents a day.  States and the departments of Justice and Housing and Urban Development have been negotiating for months with Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Ally Financial.  The uncertainty over banks’ mortgage-related exposures has weighed heavily on their stocks. The KBW Bank Index of stocks is down about 30 percent this year. Shares in Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank by assets, are down about 50 percent.  A focus of the settlement talks is what type of legal protections banks will get for agreeing to change their practices and for paying a combined penalty of possibly around $20 billion.  The contentious issue has caused fissures within the block of states dealing with the banks.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has insisted that any deal should not preclude states from pursuing further cases against the banks related to their mortgage practices.  Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, the states’ lead negotiator, announced on Tuesday that Schneiderman had been booted from the committee working on the deal.  Miller said in a statement that in recent weeks “New York has actively worked to undermine” the multi-state groups work because of differences with how to proceed.  Schneiderman’s office said he will continue to pursue a “comprehensive resolution” to mortgage problems.  New York could still sign on to a final deal negotiated by Miller’s team, although that seems unlikely at the moment.  Analysts said Schneiderman’s departure shows the remaining states, along with their partner federal agencies, are eager to strike a deal. It also could mean the settlement figure would be lower because fewer states may take part in the agreement, although government negotiators will fight to prevent it from dropping too much.  Guggenheim Securities LLC analyst Marty Mosby said even a more limited deal would likely help the banks because it would provide more certainty about the size and scope of the liabilities they face. “We go from guestimating to estimating,” Mosby said. “The range of possibilities begins to narrow and you can get more comfortable.”  A partial settlement may also help banks in their dealings with aggressive AGs like Schneiderman.  Gilbert Schwartz, partner at Schwartz & Ballen LLP and a former Federal Reserve lawyer who is not involved in the negotiations, said lenders could point to the settlement as a precedent both during negotiations with Schneiderman and in court.  “If he has to go his own way, the banks are just going to get their backs up and fight him,” Schwartz said.

145,WFC,"Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, Loan Star win Anglo Irish loans: sources","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Lone Star Funds were the winners of the $9.5 billion pool of U.S. commercial real estate loan sold by failed lender Anglo Irish Bank Corp, two sources familiar with the deal said.  The sale marks one of the biggest since the downturn in U.S. commercial real estate four years ago.  It attracted more than two dozen buyers, said a source who was not authorized to speak on the record. The total price paid for all the loans was between $7 billion and $8 billion, the source said.  To attract a large pool of potential buyers, the portfolio was broken into eight separate pools according to the performance of the loans and the length to maturity.  The first three pools contained performing loans. JPMorgan was the winner of the first tranche comprising loans with a balance of about $1 billion to $1.5 billion, the source said.  Wells Fargo won the second and third tranches valued at about $3 billion to $3.5 billion, the source said. Wells Fargo recently bought a $1.4 billion performing loan portfolio from the failed Bank of Ireland for about par, another source said.  Global distressed debt and equity investor Lone Star won the remaining five pools of sub-performing and non-performing loans. The five pools have a face value of about $5 billion.  Those loans, which could lead to the buyer either getting the property or restructuring the loans, had attracted other private equity firms, such as TPG Capital LP and Blackstone Group LP.  The winners were notified Thursday night, another source said. Bloomberg first reported the story.  The sales are expected to close in October.  The pools have also been split along the lines of real estate types — hotels, apartments, condominiums, offices and warehouses, according to an information sheet obtained by Reuters.  Anglo Irish and a spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment. Representatives from Loan Star and Wells Fargo could not be reached for comment.  Other bidders who were either part of the first or second round of bids included Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, Vornado Realty Trust, Starwood Capital, and Torchlight Investors, an independent adviser focused on commercial real estate debt investments.

146,WFC,"Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, Loan Star win Anglo Irish loans - sources"," NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co , JPMorgan Chase & Co and Lone Star Funds were the winners of the $9.5 billion pool of U.S. commercial real estate loan sold by failed lender Anglo Irish Bank Corp , two sources familiar with the deal said.	   The sale marks one of the biggest since the downturn in U.S. commercial real estate four years ago.	   It attracted more than two dozen buyers, said a source who was not authorized to speak on the record. The total price paid for all the loans was between $7 billion and $8 billion, the source said.	   To attract a large pool of potential buyers, the portfolio was broken into eight separate pools according to the performance of the loans and the length to maturity.	   The first three pools contained performing loans. JPMorgan was the winner of the first tranche comprising loans with a balance of about $1 billion to $1.5 billion, the source said.	   Wells Fargo won the second and third tranches valued at about  $3 billion to $3.5 billion, the source said. Wells Fargo recently bought a $1.4 billion performing loan portfolio from the failed Bank of Ireland for about par, another source said.	   Global distressed debt and equity investor Lone Star won the remaining five pools of sub-performing and non-performing loans.	 The five pools have a face value of about $5 billion.	   Those loans, which could lead to the buyer either getting the property or restructuring the loans, had attracted other private equity firms, such as TPG Capital LP and Blackstone Group LP .	   The winners were notified Thursday night, another source said. Bloomberg first reported the story.	   The sales are expected to close in October.	   The pools have also been split along the lines of real estate types — hotels, apartments, condominiums, offices and warehouses, according to an information sheet obtained by Reuters.	   Anglo Irish and a spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment. Representatives from Loan Star and Wells Fargo could not be reached for comment.	   Other bidders who were either part of the first or second round of bids included Goldman Sachs Group Inc , Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), Vornado Realty Trust , Starwood Capital, and Torchlight Investors, an independent adviser focused on commercial real estate debt investments.

147,WFC,Exclusive: Bank of America kept AIG legal threat under wraps,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top Bank of America Corp lawyers knew as early as January that American International Group Inc was prepared to sue the bank for more than $10 billion, seven months before the lawsuit was filed, according to sources familiar with the matter.  Bank of America shares fell more than 20 percent on August 8, the day the lawsuit was filed, adding to worries about the stability of the largest U.S. bank. It wasn’t until Warren Buffett stepped up with a $5 billion investment that those fears were eased, though hardly eliminated.  The bank made no mention of the lawsuit threat in a quarterly regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission just four days earlier. Nor did management discuss it on conference calls about quarterly results and other pending legal claims.  The SEC’s rules for litigation disclosure are murky, and some lawyers said Bank of America may have been justified in not revealing AIG’s lawsuit before it was filed. The bank’s litigation disclosures are in line with those of many rivals.  But other lawyers said banks have an obligation to disclose legal threats that could have major consequences.  “Publicly owned companies are supposed to disclose material threatened litigation under generally accepted accounting principles,” said Richard Rowe, a former director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance, who was commenting generally and not specifically about Bank of America.  Rowe, now a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of law firm Proskauer Rose, said bank executives must make a “judgment call” as to what is material, but “the general rule is, if it’s threatened litigation and it’s material, and you can put a number on it, you should disclose it.”  AIG’s lawsuit shows why investors are so fearful: they have no idea how much litigation lurks behind closed doors.  “Management surely has a credibility problem with investors,” said Jonathan Finger, whose Finger Interests Number One Ltd in Houston owns Bank of America shares. “They continue to under-address or under-disclose on the mortgage issue.”  Finger in 2009 sued the bank over its disclosures related to the takeover of Merrill Lynch & Co.  Bank of America and AIG declined to comment for this article.  SEC staff have this year advised banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, and Morgan Stanley to disclose more information about lawsuits that have been filed, as well as legal proceedings that they know the government is considering.  Banks have responded by providing additional information, including legal loss estimates in some cases.  But the agency has given banks more leeway in disclosing the expected cost of early-stage litigation, or threats of litigation whose outcome is more difficult to predict, according to securities lawyers and current and former regulatory officials.  There are two standards for disclosing legal liabilities. One under banks’ legal proceedings relies on whether losses are “reasonably probable” and “reasonably estimable.” Another, under management’s discussion and analysis, is based on whether losses are “reasonably possible.” Disclosure relies heavily on management’s assessment of the merits of a case.  Companies might need to disclose large potential lawsuits, even if they believe a loss is improbable, as well as less consequential cases if a loss appears certain, said Meredith Cross, director of the agency’s Division of Corporation Finance, in an interview with Reuters about the SEC’s disclosure requirements.  “The goal has been to have better disclosures, which should result in fewer surprises,” said Cross, who was speaking generally and not commenting on any specific institution.  Legal experts say it is difficult for top bank executives to decide exactly what they have to disclose in relation to pending and potential legal matters. That is particularly true in the current environment, they said, in which confidence in large banks is so easily shaken by legal threats that may or may not have merit.  “This is a classic problem in the disclosure regime with litigation,” said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “You’re required to disclose anything material. The question is, ‘is it material?’ You have to gauge the size and the probability of success, which is very hard to evaluate.”  Before suing Bank of America, AIG spent months analyzing publicly available data on a sample of 262,322 loans behind mortgage-backed securities it bought from Bank of America and its Merrill Lynch and Countrywide units between 2005 and 2007.  In its court filing, AIG said marketing materials touted the loans as being much safer than they were.  For instance, AIG said that in almost every bond offering, it was told that none of the mortgages were worth more than the value of the underlying property, when in fact one in six loans were underwater from the day they were born.  AIG raised such issues with Bank of America in January and said it planned to sue unless a settlement could be reached, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The sources either had direct knowledge of the legal proceedings or were briefed on them, but were not authorized to discuss the case publicly.  Both sides entered a “tolling agreement” to stop any legal statutes of limitation from running out while settlement talks were underway, but by March it became clear that AIG was prepared to sue for more than $10 billion, the people said.  Bank of America disputed AIG’s claims, saying losses stemmed from the insurer’s flawed decision making, as well as broader declines in home values and capital markets, the people said. The parties agreed to enter mediation proceedings during the second quarter, and also floated other proposals to no avail, the people said.  “There were lots of efforts made to avoid the filing over a period of months, but ultimately the discussions were not fruitful,” said one of the people.  A key stumbling block was Bank of America’s refusal to provide data for all of the loans, to show whether AIG’s sample — the heart of its case — was representative.  Bank of America “ignored” AIG’s requests for such information, while trustees and mortgage-servicers that also had access to the information “flat-out refused to cooperate,” according to AIG’s complaint.  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank has yet to respond in court to AIG’s lawsuit, but has said the insurer should have been smart enough to understand what it was buying.  “AIG recklessly chased high yields and profits throughout the mortgage and structured finance markets,” spokesman Larry DiRita said. “It is the very definition of an informed, seasoned investor, with losses solely attributable to its own excesses and errors.”  Bank of America devotes plenty of space in its regulatory filings to mortgage litigation.  The bank suffered after buying Countrywide Financial Corp, the largest U.S. subprime lender, in 2008 for $2.5 billion. Litigation and loan losses linked to that deal have cost the bank more than $30 billion.  In its August 4 quarterly filing, Bank of America spent nearly 4,000 words on a footnote describing litigation and regulatory matters. The bank said it spent $2.3 billion on legal costs, not including external fees, during the period, and could be short on reserves for future legal liabilities by as much as $2.3 billion.  On June 29, Bank of America said it agreed to pay $8.5 billion to resolve what it said would be much of the litigation it faced over mortgage-backed securities, and set aside another $5.5 billion for future possible claims.  The agreement with 22 investors including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Blackrock Inc, Allianz SE’s Pimco and others, covered mortgages with $174 billion in unpaid principal balance. Still, many investors have challenged the planned payout and disclosures as inadequate.  On a conference call to discuss the agreement, Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch asked for further explanation of securities litigation not covered by the deal.  “That will be an ongoing process,” Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson replied. “And I think if you look at the disclosure and what we have out there, it is pretty fulsome.”  Many large U.S. banks offer limited disclosure about their potential future legal bills.  None of the six biggest U.S. banks have volunteered definitive estimates of future legal costs, exact numbers of lawsuits or the potential damages that plaintiffs seek.  In its most recent quarterly filing, for example, JPMorgan said it is facing more than 10,000 legal proceedings, and that it may have to pay about $5.1 billion more to resolve these claims than the sum it has set aside. What that sum is, it does not say. Citigroup and Wells Fargo have made similar disclosures.  Morgan Stanley has offered legal-loss estimates for a handful of cases, totaling $1.7 billion, while Goldman Sachs lowered its legal-loss estimate by $700 million last quarter to $2 billion, even though it also detailed a slew of new legal and regulatory matters.  Barclays analyst Roger Freeman describes such legal-loss estimates as little more than holding a finger to the wind.  “We do not believe that this represents the realistic expected value of legal liabilities,” he said of Goldman Sachs’ estimate.  Bank of America’s shares dropped 20.3 percent on August 8 when the AIG lawsuit was filed, though many other factors influenced bank stocks that day, including Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the United States.  Since that time, its stock recovered only after Buffett — whose Berkshire Hathaway has made several investments in financial firms since 2008 — expressed support with a $5 billion preferred stock investment.  On Monday, the bank said it sold about half its stake in China Construction Bank for $8.3 billion, which also boosted Bank of America’s shares.  But even with the extra capital, Bank of America is sure to face huge legal hurdles over the long term.  “I’m concerned about the litigation, obviously,” said University of Delaware’s Elson, who is also a Bank of America shareholder. “Until it happens, you just don’t know.” (Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel, Joe Rauch and Ben Berkowitz.

148,WFC,Lenders making more subprime car loans: report,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lenders are making more subprime auto loans again, reversing the cautious approach they adopted after the credit crisis, an industry research firm said on Tuesday.  The portion of car loans made to subprime borrowers rose to 40.8 percent in the second quarter from 37.2 percent a year earlier, according to Experian Automotive, a unit of credit bureau and research firm Experian Plc.  The data shows how keen lenders are to boost their loan books amid a sluggish economy. Car loans are seen by lenders like Ally Financial and Wells Fargo Co as relatively safe because they are collateralized and repossessing cars is easier than foreclosing on homes. Compared with house prices, used car values held up well during the recession.  Average credit scores for borrowers declined and the average term for their loans extended by one month to 63 months on new cars and 59 months on used cars, according to Experian.  “We are continuing to see growth in subprime, both new and used, and loans are becoming looser,” Melinda Zabritski, director of automotive credit for Experian, said in an interview.  Executives at Ally Financial said in May that subprime car lending had become “very attractive” because profit margins on the loans more than cover the cost of expected losses from borrowers who fail to repay what they owe. Making the loans is part of Ally’s strategy to grow by lending on more used cars.  Gina Proia, a company spokeswoman, said the company places “greater emphasis on the higher end of the nonprime spectrum” and only lends to people who show they can pay.  Ally made the second most used car loans in the second quarter, with 3.9 percent of the market, according to Experian. Wells Fargo was first with 7.17 percent of used car loans.  Industry veterans have said that while the loans have been attractive recently, more lenders are entering the market and competing for business by lowering prices, a trend that could lead to higher losses in the future.  In mid 2007, industry-wide loans to subprime borrowers made up 46.2 percent of the total. That easy lending led to a surge in delinquency rates before lenders turned conservative.  Tighter underwriting has resulted in fewer loans going bad. Loans delinquent by 30 days fell to 2.59 percent of those outstanding in the second quarter of this year, down from 2.89 percent a year earlier, according to Experian.  “Even though we have growth in subprime of late, our delinquency rates right now are extremely low,” said Zabritski. “We have an overall stable market because we did have a lot of conservative lending in 2009 and 2010.”  Repossessions have declined, too, with the percentage of car loans ending in repossession falling to 0.59 percent from 0.62 percent.  In another measure of market share tracked by Experian, the five most frequent lenders and their portions of the number of loans of all kinds made during the quarter were: Ally Financial, 6.93 percent; Wells Fargo & Co, 5.79 percent; Toyota, 4.84 percent; JPMorgan Chase & Co, 4.75 percent; and Honda, 3.92 percent.

152,WFC,Fed orders Goldman to review foreclosures,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve ordered Goldman Sachs Group Inc to hire a consultant to review practices of a former mortgage subsidiary on Thursday and said it plans to assess a monetary penalty for wrongful foreclosures.  The Fed’s crackdown sent Goldman shares down 3.5 percent on Thursday, even as the bank announced that it had completed the sale of Litton Loan Servicing LP, the mortgage-servicing business at the heart of its foreclosure problems.  Litton’s regulatory troubles stem largely from the practice of “robosigning,” in which bank employees signed foreclosure documents without reviewing case files as required by law.  Many large banks, including Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co and Citigroup Inc, have been targets of probes by state and federal regulators over the same issue, in the clean-up after a world financial crisis triggered in large part by bad mortgages in the United States and bonds backed by those loans.  The Fed cited “a pattern of misconduct and negligence” at Litton in announcing its enforcement action against Goldman.  An outside consultant will have to review all of Litton’s foreclosure activity in 2009 and 2010, to identify borrowers who suffered financial losses due to improper practices. Goldman will have to reimburse those customers and is also responsible for any fines that the Fed assesses after the review is complete.  Separately, Goldman also reached a foreclosure-practices pact on Thursday with New York Financial Services Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky, helping clear the way for the bank to sell the business to Ocwen Financial Corp for $264 million.  The bank agreed to forgive 25 percent of principal balances for struggling homeowners who are 60 days past due on mortgage payments, at a cost of $53 million. Goldman will also compensate some Litton home loan borrowers for wrongful foreclosures at an indeterminate cost.  As part of the deal, Goldman, Litton and Ocwen all pledged to stop the robosigning practice, institute new staffing and training requirements for employees handling foreclosures and withdraw pending foreclosure actions that are based on faulty paperwork. They also agreed to compensate borrowers for wrongful foreclosures and strengthen protections for homeowners in relation to late payment fees and insurance costs.  In return, Lawsky agreed to issue a “no objection” letter to the planned Litton-Ocwen transaction.  But the agreement “does not preclude any future investigations of past practices or release any future claims or actions whatsoever,” the state agency said in a statement.  Goldman shares closed down $4.06, or 3.5 percent, at $112.16 on the New York Stock Exchange. Ocwen Financial shares closed down 52 cents, or 3.8 percent, at $13.28.  Goldman bought Litton in 2007 for $430 million, hoping to glean more information about the subprime mortgage market to help its trading business. But more recently, it has become a money-losing thorn in Goldman’s side.  The bank began considering a sale of Litton late last year, as the mortgage market continued to suffer losses and state and federal regulators began investigating industry-wide foreclosure problems. Goldman wrote down the value of the business by $220 million in the first quarter.  In a quarterly filing on August 9, Goldman said Litton was facing probes by state attorneys general and banking regulators. A group of the nation’s largest banks are said to be working toward a settlement that could resolve some of those investigations and cost the industry billions of dollars.  Ocwen is now the 12th largest mortgage-servicer in the United States after having acquired Litton, a relatively small player that ranked 23rd in the industry.

155,WFC,IFR-Wells Fargo redeems $5.8bn of TruPs at expense of investors," NEW YORK, Sept 2 (IFR) - US investors got a taste of losses to come this week when Wells Fargo & Company on Thursday triggered regulatory event calls to redeem $5.8bn of high yielding Trust Preferred (TruPs) and other securities.   Wells Fargo (WFC.N) is the first of the big US money center banks to use a regulatory call event clause embedded in its Tier 1 TruPs to begin cleaning its balance sheet of the costly capital securities. TruPs will lose their status as Tier 1 instruments in 2013 under new regulations.   The four deals the bank is redeeming carry coupons of between 7.7% and 9.75%, well above anything it would have to pay in today’s markets.   Holders of the Wells securities will lose anywhere from two to six points in price — the difference between the trading price of the TruPs before the announcement and the par price they will be given on the October 3 redemption date.   Trading levels on other TruPs could also suffer, especially those which are prime candidates for redemption.   “We expect the price of other high coupon TruPs to start reflecting a higher probability of redemption in the near term,” said Shobhit Gupta, a credit strategist at Barclays Capital.   Also on Thursday, Cincinnati-based regional bank Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O) and Cleveland-based KeyCorp (KEY.N) announced TruPS redemptions worth $25m and $30m respectively.   All three banks moved to redeem the securities after receiving approval for capital plans submitted to the Fed as part of the stress-testing process.   “The positive take-away from this action (WFC’s redemption of TruPs and preferred unit securities) shows banks are moving forward with their plans to further optimize their balance sheets,” said Bill Hobbs, managing director in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s debt capital markets group.   The regulatory event Wells used as a catalyst was last year’s passage of  the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, stipulating the phasing out of TruPS’ Tier 1 non-common equity capital status, beginning 2013.   Wells’s move is a reminder to holders of high yielding TruPS that US banks are poised to redeem as much as $100bn of the securities between now and 2013.   Billions of redemptions are likely to follow Wells’s move, once the Federal Reserve releases its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) on Basel III guidelines,  providing the next big regulatory event US banks can use as a redemption trigger.   The NPR will be released later this year and possibly as early as this month.   Once released, US banks will have 90 days to announce the redemption of their TruPS and other soon-to-be phased out non-common equity Tier 1 instruments.   Wells was able to redeem four TruPs deals which had Capital Treatment Event clauses, allowing it to call the instruments any time after a regulatory event. That enabled it to cite last year’s passage of the Dodd-Frank legislation as the trigger.   US banks are anxiously awaiting the release of the NPR to provide clarity around just how much of the costly TruPS and other Tier 1 securities they need to redeem and replace and what the optimal amount of capital should be.   Only about half of the $100bn or so of high yielding TruPS instruments slated for redemption by US banks will be replaced by new Tier 1 preferred stock.   “The big issue for retail and institutional investors is whether there will be any follow-on new issue supply they can buy to replace these attractive (TruPS) yields,” said Hobbs.   Wells, Fifth Third and KeyCorp all used cash on hand to pay for the redemptions.   The instruments being redeemed by Wells on October 3 are: Wachovia Capital Trust $837.5m of 7.85% TruPS; Wells Fargo Capital XIII $2.5bn 7.7% fixed-to-floating rate normal perpetual preferred securities (PPS); Wells Fargo Capital XIV $690m 8.625% enhanced TruPs and Wells Fargo Capital XV $1.75bn 9.75% fixed-to-floating rate normal PPS.

156,WFC,Consumer agency debated as nominee looks on,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans on Tuesday remained determined to block President Barack Obama’s nominee to head the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau but said it was nothing personal.  Republicans are demanding the administration agree to change the structure of the agency before allowing the Senate to move forward with its consideration of former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray.  “It is regrettable that the President and the majority have chosen to ignore our request rather than work with us to improve the bureau’s accountability,” Senator Richard Shelby, the leading Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, said during a hearing on Cordray’s nomination.  Whether Cordray is the right man for the job has barely entered the discussion.  Republicans have opposed the agency as an unchecked regulatory overreach since it was created as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law.  To underscore his objection to a hearing being held before Republican concerns are addressed, Shelby did not ask Cordray any questions.  “You’re caught between a big substantive debate,” Shelby told Cordray.  Democrats say the bureau is a much-needed check on lending abuses and have charged the Senate minority party with using the nomination process as blackmail to weaken the agency.  “This notion of ‘let’s wait till we get it perfect before we appoint somebody’ would have delayed I think the election of George Washington for many decades,” said Democrat Jack Reed.  The bureau, which opened its doors on July 21, will oversee products like credit cards and home loans.  In order to allow a nominees to be confirmed, Republicans want three changes made to the bureau: Have it run by a board rather than a director; subject its budget to annual congressional approval; and give other regulators more authority over bureau regulations.  Cordray’s best chance of being confirmed by the Senate is if the administration and Republicans do something they have been unable to do in recent months: compromise.  In Ohio, Cordray was a vocal critic of Wall Street and lending practices leading up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, but Republicans have not made him or his record the focus of their opposition to his nomination as director.  Cordray currently serves as the bureau’s head of enforcement having joined the agency late last year.  As an attorney general Cordray pursued lawsuits against banks but at the hearing he said he believes CFPB has the tools to avoid such confrontations.  “The supervisory tool, in particular, offers the prospect of resolving compliance issues more quickly and effectively without resorting to litigation.” he said.  Cordray said that as head of the CFPB he would be particularly attentive to not putting new burdens on small banks — an issue lawmakers are particularly sensitive about.  Cordray said the bureau could exempt small banks from certain rules and create a less intensive oversight regime for them.  “I have no plans to run for any political office,” Cordray told the hearing after Republican Senator Bob Corker expressed concern Cordray was using the consumer agency as a political springboard.  In the past Cordray has expressed interest in running for governor of Ohio, but he said on Tuesday that since coming to CFPB he has dropped his political plans.  Elizabeth Warren, the Harvard Law School professor and banking industry critic who helped created the CFPB, is being courted to run for the U.S. Senate representing Massachusetts.

159,WFC,Your Practice - Can you take it with you?," * Transitions cheaper for big firms than recruiting wars   * Merrill Lynch has four-year transition program   * Morgan Stanley Smith Barney encourages teams   By Richard Koreto   NEW YORK, Sept 6 (Reuters) - It’s an ugly fact of life for many wealth managers that getting out of the business is often harder than getting into it.   Unlike physicians or lawyers who set up their own practices and sell them decades later to younger professionals, financial advisers who work for broker-dealers and large planning firms have had few ways to cash out at retirement.   It’s one reason why a growing number of young and middle-aged brokers are becoming independent advisers. While some investment bankers argue that few of them can extract much direct value by taking the independent route, at least the advisers can own their client lists.   Those who work for broker-dealers, on the other hand, often confront the uncomfortable fact as they approach retirement that their employer “owns” the clients. In the past, many left their firms with little more than a handshake and an office party. Increasingly, however, large firms are cutting deals with advisers in their early years to ensure that their exits are a little sweeter.   The traditional brokerage industry, and particularly large firms such as Morgan Stanley Smith Barney (MS.N) (C.N), Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo Advisors (WFC.N), are realizing it’s better to help advisers with this dilemma rather than lose them.   In former days, branch managers would dole out a retiring broker’s client lists to favored colleagues — often creating hard feelings among brokers and clients.   “It’s an aging industry,” said David Grau, president of FP Transitions, which works primarily with independent advisers trying to sell or buy practices. “Clients and assets are not replaceable, so firms have to prepare for transition. Firms don’t want to have to pick up the pieces when someone leaves.”   To ease transitions, broker-dealers are increasingly encouraging advisers to work in teams composed of senior and junior members. This way departing advisers can sell the client relations over a period of time to younger team members or even those from other teams. The older partner often gets an earnout incentive tied to future revenues. This encourages brokers to keep pressing for business ahead of their retirement.   “The successor then pays the adviser, with funds coming out of revenue,” says Mindy Diamond, a New Jersey-based retail brokerage recruiter who works with independent and full-service firms. This ensures continuity for firms and clients as well as providing a just reward for the retiring adviser, she says.   Grau says the trend toward more formal transitioning gained momentum during the recent recession. “The broker-dealers have seen a need to grow but realized it was cheaper to use current advisers...rather than traditional recruiting.”   Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the biggest brokerage firm by number of advisers, has a program that helps brokers gradually move clients to successors. “An adviser can transfer his book of business to another MSSB rep and get continuing commissions for a certain period, “ said Christina Pollak, a company spokeswoman.   Merrill Lynch advisers can receive payments over a four-year exit period, according to spokeswoman Selena Morris. Advisers are expected to consult with their successors and help maintain the client relationships. Their percent of production revenue winds down gradually from 50 percent in year one to 35 percent in year four.   In practice, this can work very nicely. A 53-year-old Merrill Lynch adviser who asked not to be named said he hired “two kids” about seven years ago, who were aged 26 and 30. They had some financial experience, although not as advisers.   “My anticipation is that the practice will go to them,” he said, adding that he expect to work for them for a few years and has begun telling clients about his plans to help ensure continuity.   No one can be sure, of course, how much they can extract from their years of practice—whether they stay put at a traditional firm or take the lure of fully monetizing their practices that are being offered by a range of new model brokerages and advisory firm rollups.   The best move a wirehouse adviser can make is to inquire about the details—and keep in mind how fast the situation has changed. “Two years ago we couldn’t have even had this conversation,” says Grau.

160,WFC,RPT-Bank rules could hurt world economy - lobby group," * Group urges regulators to be cautious on new rules   * Bankers say rules could hurt economic recovery   By Dave Clarke   WASHINGTON, Sept 6 (Reuters) - New banking regulations being implemented around the world could significantly slow economic growth and hurt job creation, according to a report released on Tuesday by a lobbying group that represents international banks.   Economic output could be 3.2 percent lower by 2015 than would otherwise be the case if rules such as tougher capital standards were not put in place, according to the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based global banking lobby that represents more than 400 of the world’s biggest banks.   This would lead to 7.5 million fewer jobs being created over that time frame in the countries covered by the study, IIF said.   The report focuses on the United States, the European Union, Japan, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.   The latest assessment of government responses to the 2007-2009 financial crisis from IIF comes as regulators are putting into place, or will soon, major new rules the industry is lobbying against.   On Tuesday IIF officials warned that with major world economies still struggling to recover from the crisis, regulators have to be careful not to go too far in trying to prevent another financial crisis.   “It is critically important that the macro-economic impact of additional regulatory measures under discussion, as well as the impact of approaches to implement measures already taken, be a major consideration for governments and regulatory authorities,” Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) Chief Executive Josef Ackermann said in a release.   Regulators pushed back against a similar report from IIF released in June 2010 saying it overstated the impact of new rules and did not give enough credit to the greater financial stability they could provide.   In particular, banks are lobbying against new international capital rules for the world’s largest banks that the heads of the Group of 20 leading and emerging economies are expected to endorse in November.   Banks argue that the new capital requirements will increase their funding costs which in turn will cause them to raise the cost of lending to their customers and hurt the economy. Regulators and some academics have said the increased costs will not be as high as the industry predicts and will provide needed stability to the banking industry.   The international capital agreement, known as Basel III, will require banks to maintain top-quality capital equal to 7 percent of their risk-bearing assets.   On top of that, global “systemic” banks — a group expected to include JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), Bank of America (BAC.N), Citigroup (C.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) — may have to hold as much as an additional 2.5 percent as a buffer. Another 1 percent surcharge would be imposed if a bank becomes significantly bigger.

161,WFC,U.S. banks offered deal over lawsuits: report,"LONDON (Reuters) - Big U.S. banks in talks with state prosecutors to settle claims of improper mortgage practices have been offered a deal that may limit their legal liabilities in return for a multibillion-dollar payment, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.  The talks aim to settle allegations that banks including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and Ally Financial, seized the homes of delinquent borrowers and broke state laws by employing so-called “robosigners,” workers who signed off on foreclosure documents en masse without reviewing the paperwork.  The FT, citing five people with direct knowledge of the discussions, said state prosecutors have proposed settlement language in the “robosigning” cases that also might release the companies from legal liability for wrongful securitization practices.

163,WFC,"Republicans and Democrats fight, Cordray waits","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - On Tuesday, Richard Cordray will sit down with the Senate Banking Committee to interview for a job he is unlikely to get.  Cordray, a former attorney general in Ohio, has been nominated to be the first director of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Republicans have opposed the agency as a regulatory overreach since it was created as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law.  Cordray’s best chance of being confirmed by the Senate is if the administration and Republicans do something they have been unable to do in recent months: compromise.  Republicans have promised to block any nominee until the administration agrees to make three changes to the bureau’s structure: Have it run by a board rather than a director; subject its budget to annual congressional approval; and give other regulators more authority over bureau regulations.  Democrats have balked at the demands, charging Republicans with using the nomination process as blackmail to weaken the agency.  Senators from both parties are expected to trade jabs over the agency at Tuesday’s hearing.  The bureau, which opened its doors on July 21, is responsible for policing markets for products like credit cards and mortgages. Cordray is currently the agency’s chief of enforcement.  Whether Cordray is the right man for the job has barely entered the discussion in the larger showdown between Republicans and Democrats. That fight is over whether the bureau is the answer to ending past lending abuses and will it be the regulatory straw that breaks the lending industry’s back.  In Ohio, Cordray was a vocal critic of Wall Street and lending practices leading up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, but Republicans have not made him or his record the focus of their opposition to his nomination as director.  On Tuesday he will at least get a chance to make his pitch for the job.  As attorney general, Cordray was not afraid to file legal challenges against banks, including Bank of America Corp. In testimony prepared for Tuesday’s hearing, Cordray said he chose the litigation route in Ohio because it was among the only powers he had over banks and that as head of CFPB he could avoid such showdowns.  “The supervisory tool, in particular, offers the prospect of resolving compliance issues more quickly and effectively without resorting to litigation,” he said.  With Republicans refusing to budge, the Obama administration will have to decide if the benefits of a political fight over the merits of the agency outweigh what it may have to give up to get Cordray confirmed.  There is no evidence such a deal is on the horizon, and consumer groups and liberal activists are urging the White House to stand firm.  “We’re not going to settle for weakening the consumer bureau for establishing its full authority with a director,” said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.  The bureau cannot exercise certain powers until it has a confirmed director in place. Chief among them is the ability to oversee nonbanks that engage in lending and other consumer financial products.  What has been lost in the debate over what the bureau cannot do without a director, said Travis Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, are the significant powers the agency does have.  The bureau can now police financial products being offered by banks and write new rules to govern those markets.  “The consumer bureau has a lot of power to do a lot of good for consumers, and they need to use it,” he said.

166,WFC,Cerberus-owned NewPage files for Chapter 11,"WILMINGTON, Del./NEW YORK (Reuters) - NewPage Corp NEWPG.UL, the biggest maker of magazine paper in North America, filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday, succumbing to falling demand as advertisers and readers move online.  Competition from Europe and Asia and rising costs for pulp, energy and chemicals have also hurt its business.  NewPage, owned by Cerberus Capital Management LP CBS.UL, has been trying to restructure $4.2 billion of debt since earlier this year, but said jittery suppliers have begun cutting off credit, leaving liquidity “severely constrained,” according to filings in Delaware’s bankruptcy court.  The Miamisburg, Ohio-based company, which owns paper mills in the United States and Canada, said it obtained a commitment led by JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) for up to $600 million of credit during its bankruptcy. Other pre-bankruptcy lenders arranging the financing include Barclays Plc (BARC.L) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N).  That money will help keep the company operating, but NewPage did not lay out a plan for emerging from bankruptcy as companies often do when they file. It said it expects to continue operating its U.S. businesses as usual and is working closely with creditors and stakeholders to formulate a plan.  In court documents, the company’s financial adviser said the value of NewPage as an ongoing business is higher than it would be if it was sold off in pieces.  Creditors include Apollo Management LP APOLO.UL and Avenue Capital, which own some of the company’s second lien debt, according to sources familiar with the situation. Apollo and Avenue are also investors in NewPage competitor Verso Paper Corp (VRS.N).  The company, with $3.4 billion in assets, is the biggest Chapter 11 filing of the year and the largest filing of a non-financial company since 2009, according to Bankruptcydata.com.  Bankruptcies by large companies have declined sharply since the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to near zero following the 2008 financial crisis.  NewPage, which employs 6,000 workers at its U.S. mills, primarily produces coated paper, which is used in magazines, catalogs and high-end advertising brochures.  Its bankruptcy filing comes as competitors are also pressured by the shift to the Internet. The world’s largest maker of paper used in magazines, South Africa’s Sappi Ltd(SAPJ.J), has announced plans to close two mills this year.  NewPage operates 16 papermaking machines at mills in Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.  It also has a Nova Scotia mill that sought protection from creditors under Canadian law and said it is looking for buyers for the unit.  The company said last month it would take “downtime” at its Canadian subsidiary as the operation had been unprofitable for more than a year.  NewPage had sales of $1.8 billion in the first half of 2011, up slightly from a year earlier, according to securities filings. It suffered a net loss of $220 million in the first half, narrower than the year-earlier loss of $349 million.  NewPage grew through a series of deals. It acquired paper mills from MeadWestvaco Corp MWV.N for $2.3 billion in 2005 and took the top spot in the North American market in 2007 with a $2.5 billion deal to buy mills from Finland’s Store Enso (STERV.HE).

168,WFC,Appeals court rejects mortgage database suit,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A lawsuit accusing several mortgage lenders of fraud over home loans maintained within the industry’s private electronic database cannot proceed, according to a U.S. appeals court ruling.  The lawsuit targeted lenders, including Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo, over their use of the Mortgage Electronic Registration System.  MERS, a unit of Merscorp Inc of Reston, Virginia, owns the computerized registry which tracks the transfer of the beneficial interest in home loans, as well as any changes in loan servicers. It was also a defendant.  Mortgage loan giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and several of the largest U.S. banks established MERS in 1995 to circumvent the costly and cumbersome process of transferring ownership of mortgages and recording the changes with county clerks.  However, MERS’s role in foreclosure cases has made it a lightning rod in recent months in other court decisions which have held that loan servicers’ use of the registry violates basic real estate and mortgage laws.  Merscorp spokeswoman Janis Smith said the company is “quite pleased” by the latest ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, especially since it didn’t give the plaintiffs a chance to refashion their allegations.  “There’s some finality to it in that sense,” Smith said.  A proposed class action in an Arizona federal court alleged a conspiracy among MERS members to commit fraud and facilitate predatory lending practices.  The MERS system made it impossible for borrowers or regulators to track changes in lenders, according to a court filing.  A lower court judge dismissed the lawsuit, and on Wednesday the 9th Circuit upheld that decision.  “Although the plaintiffs allege that aspects of the MERS system are fraudulent, they cannot establish that they were misinformed about the MERS system,” wrote Judge Consuelo Callahan for the unanimous three judge 9th Circuit panel.

170,WFC,JPMorgan seeks profit pampering rich branch clients,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Banking giant JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), a relative lightweight in retail wealth management, sees untapped riches residing in its own bank branches.  The New York banking giant is expanding a wealth management business that will target Chase banking customers with between $500,000 and $5 million in assets. The program, Chase Private Client, has opened 71 of what is expected to be 250 offices by December and roughly 1,000 offices in 2013.  Within five years, the bank says Chase Private Client could generate a $1 billion a year in pretax income — if it can attract one in five branch customers to use their services.  “At my old job, I used to come to work every day focused on acquiring new clients. At Chase, we have 2 million affluent customers — they’re already here,” Chase Wealth Management Chief Executive Barry Sommers said in an interview.  Sommers until last year was CEO of JPMorgan Securities, a full-service brokerage formerly known as Bear Stearns Private Client Services. He is among a handful of Bear executives still in JPMorgan’s leadership ranks three years after the big bank snapped up the troubled investment bank in 2008.  The bank began testing Chase Private Client in 2007, staffing retail branches with bankers and investment managers focused on offering red carpet treatment to the wealthy consumer and small business banking customers.  These customers also gain access to more elite JPMorgan portfolio management services. Sommers says the unit will refer customers needing trust, estate planning and other more complex transactions to other parts of the bank.  “We want to offer our banking customers something we haven’t in the past, helping us deepen our relationships with them,” Sommers said.  Chase Private Client expects to have more than 400 bankers and 150 financial advisers, he said.  The program also may solve a challenge for JPMorgan, whose retail bank dominance in New York and other U.S. cities means the company cannot expand through takeovers or new branches without running afoul of competition regulators.  So in order to keep profits rising, Chase, like its rivals, want to a bigger share of its customer’s wallet.  Sommers says Chase has 1.8 million consumer bank customers with between half a million to $5 million in assets. This group represents just 10 percent of Chase retail bank customers but holds $1.8 trillion, or 70 percent of their combined wealth.  The venture is another bite at the wealth management apple for JPMorgan Chase, where private bankers and private-wealth client advisers oversee $776 billion for multimillionaires.  The bank also runs JPMorgan Securities, a full-service brokerage boutique with more than 400 advisers, and Chase Investment Services, whose 3,000 brokers sell stocks, funds and RIAs to a broader population of less wealthy bank customers.  Lots of banks offer brokerage services through their branches. A recent report by consulting firm Cerulli Associates said U.S. banks last year employed nearly 15,000 brokers overseeing $483 billion in client assets.  Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) last year launched Merrill Edge, an online brokerage targeting people with $100,000 to invest. Merrill Edge will double its ranks to 1,000 advisers this year and seek business from BofA branch clients.  Chase’s rich customers, to be sure, have dozens of brokerages, banks and boutiques competing to sell them investment advice. Chase is counting on its rich depositors choosing to do more business with a bank they already know.  “These are people with a strong relationship with the branch, who want some private banking capabilities,” he said.

171,WFC,Judge thwarts Wells Fargo mortgage class-action," * Discrimination claims had too little in common - judge   * Case brought for 1 million black, Hispanic borrowers   * Wal-Mart ruling made case harder - plaintiffs’ lawyer   * Wells Fargo is largest U.S. mortgage lender   By Jonathan Stempel   NEW YORK, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) won a court ruling denying class-action status to more than 1 million black and Hispanic borrowers in a lawsuit accusing it of discriminating on mortgage rates and fees.   Citing a recent landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney in San Francisco said the Wells Fargo borrowers had too many differences to justify grouping them together in a single lawsuit against the largest U.S. mortgage lender.   The ruling on Tuesday could force borrowers to pursue their claims individually or in smaller groups, which could result in higher costs and lower recoveries, or cause some plaintiffs to drop their claims altogether.   In the case, six plaintiffs said Wells Fargo’s “discretionary loan pricing procedures” allowed loan officers to impose higher rates, points and fees on minority borrowers than on white borrowers with similar credit profiles.   Citing an analysis by an outside expert, the plaintiffs said this practice had a disparate impact on black and Hispanic borrowers, and violated the federal Fair Housing Act and Equal Credit Opportunity Act. They sought to certify a class of borrowers from 2001 to the present.   But Chesney said the plaintiffs failed to show there was any “common mode” by which loan officers exercised discretion to charge them more. She added that discretion “may have been exercised differently” in each borrower’s case.   “Merely showing that a defendant’s policy of discretion has produced an overall race-based disparity does not suffice” for certification as a class-action, the judge wrote.   In its June 20 ruling in Wal-Mart Stores Inc v. Dukes, a divided Supreme Court threw out a class-action lawsuit on behalf of as many as 1.5 million female workers who accused the retailer of giving them lower pay and fewer promotions than men. It said the claims would have too little in common, having arisen from millions of employment decisions in 3,400 stores.   Gary Klein, a lawyer for the Wells Fargo plaintiffs, said his firm is evaluating options for them. “Denial of class certification is going to make further prosecution of the case difficult,” said Klein, a partner at Roddy Klein & Ryan in Boston. “Dukes certainly made our job much harder.”   A Wells Fargo spokeswoman, Vickee Adams, said the bank is pleased with Chesney’s “well-reasoned” decision.   Wells Fargo has faced other allegations it discriminates in home lending. Earlier this year, federal judges in Baltimore and Memphis, Tennessee rejected the bank’s requests to dismiss lawsuits accusing it of steering black borrowers into home loans they could not afford, resulting in more foreclosures.   The cases are In re: Wells Fargo Residential Mortgage Lending Discrimination Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 08-md-01930; City of Memphis et al v.

172,WFC,Senate panel backs U.S. bank regulator nominees," * Panel approved nominees for FDIC, OCC and SEC   * Corker raises concerns about OCC nominee   * No vote yet on Cordray for consumer finance bureau   By Dave Clarke   WASHINGTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The Senate Banking Committee on Thursday approved the nominations of several financial regulatory nominees who will play key roles in implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law.   The nominees now must be confirmed by the full Senate. No schedule has been announced for those votes.   Among the nominees approved were President Barack Obama’s choices to head two banking regulators: Martin Gruenberg to lead the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Thomas Curry to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.   The banking panel has yet to vote on former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray to head the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Republicans have said they will block a full Senate vote on Cordray unless there are changes to the structure of the bureau.   Both Gruenberg and Curry are currently members of the FDIC board, with Gruenberg serving as the agency’s acting director.   The FDIC oversees deposit taking institutions and insures individual bank accounts up to $250,000. The OCC regulates national banks, such as Bank of America (BAC.N) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N).   Gruenberg is expected to be confirmed once the Obama administration announces who it will nominate to fill two vacant spots on the FDIC board. Republicans have expressed support for his nomination but are unlikely to let it go through without knowing who else will be a part of the five-member board.   Gruenberg and Curry are seen as relatively noncontroversial  picks. Gruenberg is a former aide to the Senate Banking Committee and was a steady hand at the side of former FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair during the financial crisis.   Curry is a politically registered independent whose challenge will be changing the OCC’s reputation with critics as a friendly regulator that tries to shield large banks from state consumer protection laws.   Curry did get some pushback during Thursday’s committee meeting.   Republican Senator Bob Corker said he wants to hear more from Curry “to get a stronger sense of his independence” before deciding if he would support his nomination.   “I just, again, didn’t get a lot of strength or sense of independence in my first meeting with him,” Corker said.   Richard Shelby, the top Republican on the panel, said he agreed with Corker and urged all the nominees to address any concerns senators may have before a full Senate vote is scheduled.   Also approved by the panel were candidates for the Securities and Exchange Commission board.   Luis Aguilar, a Democrat, began serving as a commissioner at the agency in 2008 and has continued his role there even though his term expired last year.   Republican Daniel Gallagher, meanwhile, is a former SEC staffer who is now at partner in the securities department of the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr.   He would replace former SEC Commissioner Kathleen Casey, who departed the agency in August.   In addition, the committee approved the nomination of S. Roy Woodall to fill the seat on the Financial Stability Oversight Council reserved for an insurance expert.   FSOC is a council of major financial regulators headed by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and designed to spot systemic risks to the markets.   Also sent to the full Senate for a vote were the nominations of Frank D’Agostino and Gregory Karawan to be directors of the Securities Investor Protection Corp.

174,WFC,U.S. bank regulators to unveil 'living will' plan," * FDIC to vote on rule on Tuesday   * Banks concerned about how plans will be kept private   By Dave Clarke   WASHINGTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are set to vote next week on a final rule governing the plans large banks must draft on how they can be liquidated if they are heading toward failure.   The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law requires these “living wills,” which are part of the government’s new power to seize and break up large, failing firms.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp announced plans on Thursday for its board to vote on the final rule on Tuesday. It is drafting the rule with the Federal Reserve.   Regulators have to approve the plans once banks submit them. They can force changes to the structure of banks or other large financial companies if they believe the institution could not easily be liquidated once in trouble.   Former FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair, who left her post in July, had stressed the need for regulators to force banks to simplify their operations, such as by creating more subsidiaries, if the plans could not be easily executed.   The rule applies to banks with more than $50 billion in assets and to other large financial companies whose sudden failure could roil financial markets.   Proponents of this new power to seize and liquidate firms argue it will curb taxpayer bailouts and limit the sort of market turmoil caused by the 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK.   But analysts and market participants have expressed skepticism, saying the government would not let a large bank fail out of fear it would wreak havoc on the economy.   The banking industry raised some concerns about the earlier proposed version of the living will rule, which was released in April.   Banks such as Wells Fargo (WFC.N) have said regulators need to do more to ensure that the plans remain confidential and not subject to disclosure through lawsuits or Freedom of Information Act requests.   Banking groups have also asked regulators to start off with a pilot program rather than subject all eligible institutions to the requirement right away.

177,WFC,UPDATE 3-U.S. appeals court rejects mortgage database suit," * Lawsuit alleged MERS facilitated predatory lending   * Several lenders targeted, including BofA and JPMorgan   * Plaintiffs were not misinformed about MERS-court ruling  (Adds plaintiff attorney comment, byline)   By Dan Levine   SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - A lawsuit accusing several mortgage lenders of fraud over home loans maintained within the industry’s private electronic database cannot proceed, according to a U.S. appeals court ruling.   The lawsuit targeted lenders, including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N), over their use of the Mortgage Electronic Registration System.   MERS, a unit of Merscorp Inc of Reston, Virginia, owns the computerized registry which tracks the transfer of the beneficial interest in home loans, as well as any changes in loan servicers. It was also a defendant.   Mortgage loan giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and several of the largest U.S. banks established MERS in 1995 to circumvent the costly and cumbersome process of transferring ownership of mortgages and recording the changes with county clerks.   However, MERS’s role in foreclosure cases has made it a lightning rod in recent months in other court decisions which have held that loan servicers’ use of the registry violates basic real estate and mortgage laws.   Bill Nebeker, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said they had not yet decided whether to appeal Wednesday’s ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   A proposed class action in an Arizona federal court alleged a conspiracy among MERS members to commit fraud and facilitate predatory lending practices.   The MERS system made it impossible for borrowers or regulators to track changes in lenders, according to a court filing.   A lower court judge dismissed the lawsuit, and on Wednesday the 9th Circuit upheld that decision.   “Although the plaintiffs allege that aspects of the MERS system are fraudulent, they cannot establish that they were misinformed about the MERS system,” wrote Judge Consuelo Callahan for the unanimous three judge 9th Circuit panel.   Merscorp spokeswoman Janis Smith said the company is “quite pleased” by the latest ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, especially since it didn’t give the plaintiffs a chance to refashion their allegations.   “There’s some finality to it in that sense,” Smith said.   However, a separate multi-district class action against MERS is also being litigated before the same Arizona judge.   The 9th Circuit ruling will likely lead to a dismissal of that case as well, Nebeker said. But the multi-district case has a different procedural history that will fare better on appeal, Nebeker said.   Representatives for Bank of America and Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A JPMorgan Chase spokesman declined to comment.   Besides Arizona, the 9th Circuit covers other states in the Western United States hard hit by the housing crisis, including California and Nevada.   The case in the 9th Circuit is Olga Cervantes, Carlos Almendarez and Arturo Maximo, individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals v. Countrywide Home Loans Inc. et al., 09-17364.

178,WFC,COMPLY: Broker quashes clients' auction-rate complaints," * Wells Fargo testified for its former adviser   * Broker was schooled in safety of investments   * Auction-rate complaints shadow hundreds of brokers   By Suzanne Barlyn   Sept 9 (Reuters) - The auction-rate securities market remains a headache for many brokers, and a time-bomb for those whose public disclosure records are tainted by complaints from aggrieved investors.   A recent arbitration ruling from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, however, offers some hope for scores of advisers being blamed by clients for sales of the now-illiquid securities. The case also is drawing attention because the broker’s employer, now part of Wells Fargo Advisors, offered key supportive testimony to the broker’s defense.   The FINRA panel recently recommended “expunging” 15 complaints against Jason Roberts Coles, who left Wells Fargo Investments, LLC, shortly before the auction-rate market froze in February 2008.   An unnamed officer testified that the Wells Fargo (WFC.N) brokerage unit “consistently” told advisers the investments were “safe,” underscoring assertions Coles made, according to a summary of the ruling.   The case has several distinguishing features, not the least of which is a decision by a brokerage firm to support a former employee’s expungement request, said Marc Dobin, a securities lawyer in Jupiter, Florida.   Coles and his lawyer declined to comment on the ruling.   A Wells Fargo spokesman said its decision to support Coles’ expungement application doesn’t reflect overarching policy at the firm. “Each case is unique and there is no common practice,” he said.   The FINRA filing indicates that the disclosures against Coles were particularly egregious. He testified that in some cases he was not the broker for the complaining investor and never spoke to some of the complainants.   Coles also was supported by an affidavit from a customer who said the adviser wasn’t to blame for statements he made about auction-rate securities, according to the ruling.   “That’s powerful stuff for an arbitration,” Dobin said.   The panel also noted in its summary of the decision that all but one of the complaining investors were made whole by a 2009 settlement with regulators in seven states, including California where Coles worked. In the settlement, Wells Fargo Investments agreed to buy back about $1.3 billion in auction rate securities.   The remaining investor entered into a separate settlement with the firm.   Wells Fargo Investments was incorporated into Wells Fargo Advisors LLC in 2011 after the former broker-dealer businesses of Wachovia Securities were incorporated into the smaller unit of the California-based bank.   The expungement process gives brokers a way to erase certain complaints from their records, which are readily available on FINRA’s website for review by potential clients and employers .   Coles, who now works for Torrey Pines Securities Inc. in San Diego, California, is among hundreds of brokers whose disclosure records list auction-rate claims and complaints   When the $330 billion auction-rate market failed as large investment banks that ran the auctions ran into liquidity crunches, thousands of investors were left holding securities that couldn’t be sold. The securities were sold as  highly liquid short-term instruments similar to money-market funds but with slightly higher returns.   The instruments were sold for more than a decade by advisers with few problems prior to the 2008 financial crisis.   “You will find enormous amounts of brokers who have nothing on their [records], other than these auction-rate cases,” said Craig Stein, a securities lawyer in Palm Beach, Florida.   Stein, who has represented advisers and companies that include Wells Fargo, was not involved in the Coles case and declined to comment.   Publicly available brokerage records are a matter of great concern to advisers, many of whom must hire lawyers if they want to have specious claims dismissed. Complaints and disciplinary actions, along details such as employment history, are reported in FINRA’s Central Registration Depository, or CRD.   Brokerage firms usually review the disclosures when deciding to hire a candidate. Too many negative entries, even if they don’t result in disciplinary actions or fines, may also prevent brokers from getting U.S. state regulatory approvals to sell securities.   Investors also are becoming more adept at finding the information through free databases such as FINRA’s BrokerCheck service and BrightScope Inc’s Advisor Pages, Dobin said.   “There are many cases where the broker isn’t at fault,” said George Brunelle, a New York-based securities lawyer.

179,WFC,JPMorgan seeks profit pampering rich branch clients,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Banking giant JPMorgan Chase & Co, a relative lightweight in retail wealth management, sees untapped riches residing in its own bank branches.  The New York banking giant is expanding a wealth management business that will target Chase banking customers with between $500,000 and $5 million in assets. The program, Chase Private Client, has opened 71 of what is expected to be 250 offices by December and roughly 1,000 offices in 2013.  Within five years, the bank says Chase Private Client could generate a $1 billion a year in pretax income — if it can attract one in five branch customers to use their services.  “At my old job, I used to come to work every day focused on acquiring new clients. At Chase, we have 2 million affluent customers — they’re already here,” Chase Wealth Management Chief Executive Barry Sommers said in an interview.  Sommers until last year was CEO of JPMorgan Securities, a full-service brokerage formerly known as Bear Stearns Private Client Services. He is among a handful of Bear executives still in JPMorgan’s leadership ranks three years after the big bank snapped up the troubled investment bank in 2008.  The bank began testing Chase Private Client in 2007, staffing retail branches with bankers and investment managers focused on offering red carpet treatment to the wealthy consumer and small business banking customers.  These customers also gain access to more elite JPMorgan portfolio management services. Sommers says the unit will refer customers needing trust, estate planning and other more complex transactions to other parts of the bank.  “We want to offer our banking customers something we haven’t in the past, helping us deepen our relationships with them,” Sommers said.  Chase Private Client expects to have more than 400 bankers and 150 financial advisers, he said.  The program also may solve a challenge for JPMorgan, whose retail bank dominance in New York and other U.S. cities means the company cannot expand through takeovers or new branches without running afoul of competition regulators.  So in order to keep profits rising, Chase, like its rivals, want to a bigger share of its customer’s wallet.  Sommers says Chase has 1.8 million consumer bank customers with between half a million to $5 million in assets. This group represents just 10 percent of Chase retail bank customers but holds $1.8 trillion, or 70 percent of their combined wealth.  The venture is another bite at the wealth management apple for JPMorgan Chase, where private bankers and private-wealth client advisers oversee $776 billion for multimillionaires    .  The bank also runs JPMorgan Securities, a full-service brokerage boutique with more than 400 advisers, and Chase Investment Services, whose 3,000 brokers sell stocks, funds and RIAs to a broader population of less wealthy bank customers.  Lots of banks offer brokerage services through their branches. A recent report by consulting firm Cerulli Associates said U.S. banks last year employed nearly 15,000 brokers overseeing $483 billion in client assets.  Bank of America Corp last year launched Merrill Edge, an online brokerage targeting people with $100,000 to invest. Merrill Edge will double its ranks to 1,000 advisers this year and seek business from BofA branch clients.  Chase’s rich customers, to be sure, have dozens of brokerages, banks and boutiques competing to sell them investment advice. Chase is counting on its rich depositors choosing to do more business with a bank they already know.  “These are people with a strong relationship with the branch, who want some private banking capabilities,” he said.

181,WFC,Fed asks for more information on Capital One deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has asked Capital One Financial Corp to provide more information about its proposed acquisition of ING Groep NV’s online bank ING Direct in advance of a hearing next week.  The Fed, in an August 29 letter, asked the bank to detail areas where the two banks’ businesses overlap and what their market share is in these areas.  Among the areas where the Fed is seeking more information are securities lending, commercial paper, credit card lending and mortgage servicing.  The Fed said last month it would extend the comment period on the deal and would hold three public hearings. The first is scheduled for September 20 in Washington.  Some consumer and low-income housing groups are pushing the Fed to scrutinize the deal under a provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law that requires regulators to determine if an acquisition would create a bank so large that its failure would threaten the stability of financial markets.  They are viewing the Fed’s request for additional information as evidence this concern is being taken seriously, said a spokesman for the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.  Capital One has pushed back against this argument, noting the new bank would be far smaller than Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.  If the purchase goes through the new entity would be the seventh-largest U.S. bank, with more than $300 billion in assets, according to SNL Financial, a financial services data firm.  The request for information was first reported on Sunday by The Wall Street Journal.  A spokeswoman for Capital One said on Sunday that the bank has responded to the Fed and the information provided “confirms that we are not engaged in the kind or level of activities that raise the systemic risk issues that the Dodd-Frank Act sought to address.”  Capital One agreed in June to buy ING Direct from the Dutch banking and insurance group for $9 billion in stock and cash. ING had to sell the business, one of the jewels of its retail banking franchise, as part of a deal with the European Commission following its October 2008 Dutch government bailout.

183,WFC,Fed asks for more information on Capital One deal,"   * Fed will hold hearing on deal to buy ING next week   * Some groups say deal could create ‘too big to fail’ bank   By Dave Clarke   WASHINGTON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has asked Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) to provide more information about its proposed acquisition of ING Groep NV’s ING.AS online bank ING Direct in advance of a hearing next week.   The Fed, in an Aug. 29 letter, asked the bank to detail areas where the two banks’ businesses overlap and what their market share is in these areas.   Among the areas where the Fed is seeking more information are securities lending, commercial paper, credit card lending and mortgage servicing.   The Fed said last month it would extend the comment period on the deal and would hold three public hearings. The first is scheduled for Sept. 20 in Washington.   Some consumer and low-income housing groups are pushing the Fed to scrutinize the deal under a provision in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law that requires regulators to determine if an acquisition would create a bank so large that its failure would threaten the stability of financial markets.

184,WFC,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo sees opportunities in bond market-CFO," Sept 12 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) sees opportunities in buying bonds for its securities portfolio after recent market dislocations, the company’s chief financial officer said on Monday.   Speaking at a conference, CFO Tim Sloan said the bank sees some bonds as cheap relative to their riskiness. Commercial mortgage-backed securities are an example, he said.   Sloan also said the bank hopes to reduce its quarterly non-interest expenses to $11 billion by the fourth quarter of 2012, compared with $12.48 billion in the second quarter of 2011.   Lower expenses reflect a combination of declining merger integration costs and cost-cutting.

185,WFC,SEC says no probes hurt by destroyed records,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A past practice of destroying certain pre-investigative materials has not harmed any current or future investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. agency’s enforcement chief said on Wednesday.  The comments from SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami, which were made in a letter to Senator Charles Grassley, mark the strongest defense by the SEC yet after an internal whistle-blower accused the agency of wrongfully destroying important investigative files, including “matters under inquiry,” or MUIs.  “We do not believe that current or future investigations have been harmed by the division’s old MUI retention policy,” said Khuzami, adding that data the agency did save electronically still lets the SEC “connect the dots” between current and closed matters.  Khuzami’s letter to Grassley is the latest twist in an ongoing saga that first began in July 2010 after Darcy Flynn, an agency lawyer, complained that important early-stage investigative records were being improperly discarded.  Flynn took his concerns to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which last month issued a statement declaring that the SEC had indeed destroyed the records without the proper authority. NARA noted, however, that the SEC had stopped destroying the records and was working with NARA on a new records retention policy.  Khuzami’s letter is a response to Grassley, who last month demanded answers from the SEC after learning of Flynn’s allegations about the MUI document destruction. Grassley had said that Flynn told him the records of major high-profile cases including Bernard Madoff, Goldman Sachs, trading in AIG credit-default swaps, alleged frauds at Wells Fargo and Bank of America, and insider-trading probes at Deutsche Bank, Lehman Brothers and the hedge fund SAC Capital.  More recently, a letter to the SEC from Flynn’s attorney, Gary Aguirre, also raised concerns documents from more formal investigations have also been discarded. The SEC has since ceased destroying all investigative records until further notice.  In Khuzami’s letter to Grassley, he downplayed the importance of some of the kinds of documents that may have been discarded.  An MUI is based on “readily available information” including public data, and the threshold for opening one “is low,” he said.  He added the SEC retained “significant information” concerning all MUIs through an electronic records system that dates back 20 years.  Moreover, the records from MUIs that become more formal investigations were retained. Only records from closed matters under inquiry were not stored as official files and in some cases discarded, he said.  Senator Grassley, in a statement late on Wednesday, sounded skeptical about Khuzami’s claims in the letter.  “Since the documents are gone, we’ll never know how important they might have been. How do you know whether you might have been helped by something you no longer have?” he asked. “Federal records are federal records and have to be preserved, regardless of whether they’re part of an ‘investigation’ or an ‘inquiry.’”  ",9142011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-documents/sec-says-no-probes-hurt-by-destroyed-records-idUSTRE78D78L20110914

187,WFC,IFR-Redwood Trust set to launch US$375m private RMBS," NEW YORK, Sept 14 (IFR) - Redwood Trust, a California-based REIT, is about to launch its second private-label RMBS of the year, a US$375.2m prime-mortgage offering called Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2011-2 (SEMT 2011-2), according to a presale report released on Wednesday by Fitch Ratings.   The REIT is the only issuer of non-agency prime-jumbo MBS since the onset of the financial crisis.  It completed two previous post-crisis private-label transactions: a US$290.4m offering in February, and a US$222m deal in April 2010, which was the first private US RMBS following the crisis.   Another issuer, Springleaf Financial, a consumer lender, recently helped to reopen the subprime segment of the mortgage sector at the beginning of September when it priced a US$292m RMBS offering.   Redwood Trust executives have been outspoken about the need to revive a mortgage market backed by private capital. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHA currently finance nearly 95% of the US mortgage market, a figure that many experts say is unsustainable in the long run.   The deal currently being prepped, SEMT 2011-2, will be backed by 473 prime fixed-rate mortgages originated by six originators, 80% of which were originated by First Republic Bank (53%) and PHH Mortgage (27%).   The rest of the pool was originated by Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (8%), SunTrust Mortgage (7%), PrimeLending (4%) and Sterling Savings Bank (0.9%).  Distributions of principal and interest and loss allocations are based on a traditional senior-subordinate shifting-interest structure.   According to Fitch, the collateral pool consists of fully documented loans to mostly high-income borrowers with exceptionally strong credit profiles, low leverage on properties, and large reserve amounts. Third-party, loan-level due diligence was conducted on approximately 70% of the pool. Fitch reviewed the due diligence findings, and believes that the results of the review generally reflect strong underwriting controls.   Like Redwood’s last transaction, SEMT 2011-2 also has exposure to properties in the earthquake-prone San Francisco region, albeit slightly less exposure than the previous offering.   This factor caused controversy for the February’s deal, titled SEMT 2011-1, since Redwood originally hired Moody’s to rate the issue, but ultimately disagreed with the rating agency’s assessment that the deal’s exposure to seismic activity-prone regions meant that it needed to be rated more strictly.   Ultimately, only Fitch received the mandate for that transaction, which contained nearly 60% exposure to California mortgage loans, with an emphasis on the San Francisco Bay Area.   The current deal has 53.6% concentration in California, and 31.3% of the properties are in the greater San Francisco area. Fitch said that it applied a penalty adjustment to the pool’s lifetime default expectations to account for this exposure.   Moody’s had been the sole rater of Redwood’s 2010 deal, which had a much smaller concentration of California loans.   It is not yet clear whether Moody’s will also be rating the current SEMT 2011-2 transaction.   BANKS ARE NEXT TO RE-ENTER MARKET   So far, only Redwood Trust, a REIT, has issued a post-crisis private mortgage bond.   Banks are likely to be next. While several big banks are ramping up new private-label RMBS programs for the second half of 2011, a well-placed RMBS market source recently indicated that Wells Fargo (WFC.N) may be the first bank to issue a transaction, helping to reignite the non-agency market. The deal could surface as soon as the fourth-quarter, the source said.   Wells Fargo declined comment.   A drop in the loan-limit size that the GSEs will guarantee to US$625,500 from US$729,750, scheduled for October 1, is expected to create more supply for the non-agency mortgage sector and give impetus to bank issuers to get the private-label ball rolling again.   This increase in non-agency supply driven by the loan-limit decrease may actually be marginal, securitization specialists say, but banks acknowledge the overall advantages of re-establishing a well-structured, vibrant private mortgage securitization market, including renewed access to different funding sources and increased flexibility in lending operations.   Wells Fargo has so far weathered post-crisis MBS litigation comparatively better than other big banks, and therefore might be better positioned to line up an RMBS transaction earlier than Bank of America or JP Morgan, securitization sources said.   The San Francisco-based bank has agreed to pay US$590m to settle a class-action lawsuit associated with MBS from Wachovia Securities, which it acquired at the end of 2008, according to a recent SEC filing.

188,WFC,Insight: BofA cuts foretell downturn in branch banking,"(Reuters) - To see why Bank of America Corp can cut 30,000 jobs from its consumer banking business, just stop by one of the 14,000 new automatic teller machines it has installed over the last three years.  The machines scan checks and cash and allow deposits to be reflected in customer accounts the same day. A scanning ATM is faster and less prone to processing error than a teller.  Combined with the bank’s other efforts to shunt customers away from tellers, the ATMs will make many consumer banking personnel all but unnecessary.  Bank of America has about 95,000 employees in consumer and small business banking. To Chief Executive Brian Moynihan, this area, and retail banking in particular, may be the bank’s best opportunity for cutting costs.  The golden era of branch banking is over, analysts said.  “A branch system is simply becoming uneconomical,” said Nancy Bush, a bank analyst and contributing editor at SNL Financial.  Bush estimates the industry will need 20 percent fewer branches over time due to electronic banking advances and changing customer behavior. “It just makes no sense to have a huge network.”  For years, banks have raced to build and buy branches in a dash to grab as many deposits as possible.  But starting in 2010, the number of branches fell 1 percent to 98,507, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Many of the branches that remain are likely to be slimmed down. Banks may still want deposits, but they want them cheap.  Bank of America is one of many banks that is likely to lay off retail banking staff. Analysts said Wells Fargo & Co for example, is likely to follow a similar strategy.  A Wells Fargo spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment.  Shuttering branches and laying off retail staff is a fast way to cut costs, and Bank of America’s Moynihan needs quick fixes.  The biggest U.S. bank has lost more than $12 billion over the last five quarters, hurt by bad mortgages and related litigation, and its shares have lost nearly half their value this year.  The bank has deployed about 50 executives to review over 150,000 proposals for restructuring the bank, in a program known as the “New BAC.” The name refers to the bank’s stock symbol.  On Monday, the bank announced plans to cut 30,000 jobs from its range of consumer business units over the next several years as part of the first phase of New BAC.  Expense reductions in retail partly reflect a series of acquisitions by Moynihan’s predecessors that were never properly stitched together, resulting in, for example, the bank having 63 data centers in the United States.  “That’s not what we planned to have, but it’s what we ended up with,” Moynihan said at a conference on Monday.  Some people familiar with the bank said it has been slow to take steps such as moving to a single deposit system, which tracks the deposits a customer makes to his or her account. Arguably, uniting those systems should have happened years ago.  Bank of America is moving to a single deposit system, Moynihan told the conference. He also said that Bank of America’s second wave of expense reduction efforts in other businesses may be smaller.  Rationalizing acquisitions is one source of cost cuts, but technology is important too. Automated teller machines have been accepting deposits for decades, but customers were long hesitant to use them for anything but withdrawing cash and checking balances.  Older ATMs require customers to put their checks and cash in envelopes, which remain in the machine until bank employees collect them and process them by hand. It is safe, but for many customers it feels like putting a message in a bottle.  For most banks, the check processing happens off site, meaning an armored truck has to pick up the deposits and take them to another location.  Scanning ATMs allow an image of a check to be sent to a processing center, which can now be much farther away from the bank. The ATMs often recognize the dollar amounts mentioned on the check, allowing money to be posted to an account faster. Cash deposits can be posted immediately to the customer’s account. Customers can make payments for credit cards, home equity and personal loans linked to their accounts on Bank of America’s new ATMs.  “Our customers don’t want to wait. There’s this expectation they can come in and get out quickly,” said Shelley Waite, the bank’s ATM channel executive, in an interview with Reuters  The popularity of the spiffed-up machines is clear: just a quarter of the bank’s customers used to deposit money through ATMs while today half do — and the percentage is growing, Waite said.  That translates into real savings. Check deposits at a scanning ATM cost the bank about 59 cents per transaction, compared with about $1.48 for teller deposits and about $1.82 for conventional ATMs, according to research firm Tower Group.  Or look at it this way: a scanning ATM can cost $45,000 and last five years for an annual cost of around $9,000. A teller typically costs around $30,000 a year, including benefits, said Darryl Demos, a managing director at consulting firm Novantas.  A branch has about seven employees on average, three or four of which would be tellers. With scanning ATMs it can likely reduce that staffing by one or two tellers, said Demos.  Scanning ATMs also allow banks to reduce their deposit processing staff.  And longer term, banks may be able to take tellers out of branches entirely, and have them work with customers remotely through video conferencing technology. Citigroup and other banks are experimenting with that kind of technology now.  Bank of America has taken other steps to reduce its branch personnel costs, including moving clients with low balances into accounts that charge a fee for using a teller.  Not every bank and every branch will use scanning ATMs to slim down staff levels. Some will replace tellers with investment advisors, mortgage lenders, or other product specialists. And some banks that pride themselves on personal service will still keep large numbers of staffers.  For as long as there have been ATMs, analysts and bankers have been forecasting the demise of tellers, but so far layoffs have been relatively modest.  But scanning ATMs, narrowing bank profits and weak loan demand should put new pressure on banks to cut staff and close branches, experts say.  Bank of America, which boasted a record 6,100 branches in 2008, today has 5,700 and plans to close around 10 percent of its branches in the coming years.  “I’ve been helping banks with branches for decades,” Novantas’ Demos said. “There’s never been the sense of urgency that there is now to get it right.”  ",9152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bankofamerica-layoffs/insight-bofa-cuts-foretell-downturn-in-branch-banking-idUSTRE78E7FF20110915

Expense reductions in retail partly reflect a series of acquisitions by Moynihan’s predecessors that were never properly stitched together, resulting in, for example, the bank having 63 data centers in the United States.   “That’s not what we planned to have, but its what we ended up with,” Moynihan said at a conference on Monday.   Some people familiar with the bank said it has been slow to take steps such as moving to a single deposit system, which tracks the deposits a customer makes to his or her account. Arguably, uniting those systems should have happened years ago.  Bank of America is moving to a single deposit system, Moynihan told the conference. He also said that Bank of America’s second wave of expense reduction efforts in other businesses may be smaller.   Rationalizing acquisitions is one source of cost cuts, but technology is important too. Automated teller machines have been accepting deposits for decades, but customers were long hesitant to use them for anything but withdrawing cash and checking balances.   Older ATMs require customers to put their checks and cash in envelopes, which remain in the machine until bank employees collect them and process them by hand. It is safe, but for many customers it feels like putting a message in a bottle.   For most banks, the check processing happens off site, meaning an armored truck has to pick up the deposits and take them to another location.   Scanning ATMs allow an image of a check to be sent to a processing center, which can now be much farther away from the bank. The ATMs often recognize the dollar amounts mentioned on the check, allowing money to be posted to an account faster. Cash deposits can be posted immediately to the customer’s account. Customers can make payments for credit cards, home equity and personal loans linked to their accounts on Bank of America’s new ATMs.   “Our customers don’t want to wait. There’s this expectation they can come in and get out quickly,” said Shelley Waite, the bank’s ATM channel executive, in an interview with Reuters   The popularity of the spiffed-up machines is clear: just a quarter of the bank’s customers used to deposit money through ATMs while today half do — and the percentage is growing, Waite said.   That translates into real savings. Check deposits at a scanning ATM cost the bank about 59 cents per transaction, compared with about $1.48 for teller deposits and about $1.82 for conventional ATMs, according to research firm Tower Group.   Or look at it this way: a scanning ATM can cost $45,000 and last five years for an annual cost of around $9,000. A teller typically costs around $30,000 a year, including benefits, said Darryl Demos, a managing director at consulting firm Novantas.   A branch has about seven employees on average, three or four of which would be tellers. With scanning ATMs it can likely reduce that staffing by one or two tellers, said Demos.   Scanning ATMs also allow banks to reduce their deposit processing staff.   And longer term, banks may be able to take tellers out of branches entirely, and have them work with customers remotely through video conferencing technology. Citigroup and other banks are experimenting with that kind of technology now. [ID:nN15165639]   Bank of America has taken other steps to reduce its branch personnel costs, including moving clients with low balances into accounts that charge a fee for using a teller.   Not every bank and every branch will use scanning ATMs to slim down staff levels. Some will replace tellers with investment advisors, mortgage lenders, or other product specialists. And some banks that pride themselves on personal service will still keep large numbers of staffers.   But new ATMs and narrowing bank profits should result in more branch reductions, and more staffing cuts for branches that stay open, experts say.   Bank of America, which boasted a record 6,100 branches in 2008, today has 5,700 and plans to close around 10 percent of its branches in the coming years.   “I’ve been helping banks with branches for decades,” Novantas’ Demos said. “There’s never been the sense of urgency that there is now to get it right.”  (Reporting by Joe Rauch in Charlotte, North Carolina and Dan Wilchins in New York; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)   ",9152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/bankofamerica-layoffs/insight-bofa-cuts-foretell-a-downturn-in-branch-banking-idUSS1E78E0UJ20110915
191,WFC,Wells sues JPMorgan over 800 mortgage loans,"(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) was sued by Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), which seeks to force it to buy back more than 800 soured mortgage loans that it oversees as trustee.  In a complaint made public on Wednesday in the Delaware Chancery Court, Wells Fargo accused JPMorgan’s EMC Mortgage LLC unit of refusing its demands that EMC buy back the loans, which were contained in Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2.  JPMorgan bought Bear Stearns and its EMC unit in 2008.  In the complaint, Wells Fargo said EMC and its affiliates routinely approved mortgage loans despite “clear defects” in loan applications, including faulty appraisals and inflated borrower incomes.  It also said a forensic review showed that EMC breached representations and warranties on 89 percent of a sample of 948 of mortgage loans.  “The loans have been plagued by an alarming rate of defaults and foreclosures,” Wells Fargo said.  JPMorgan spokesman Patrick Linehan declined to comment.  Trustees such as Wells Fargo act on behalf of investors in securities backed by underlying loans.

193,WFC,SEC says no probes hurt by destroyed records,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A past practice of destroying certain pre-investigative materials has not harmed any current or future investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. agency’s enforcement chief said on Wednesday.  The comments from SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami, which were made in a letter to Senator Charles Grassley, mark the strongest defense by the SEC yet after an internal whistle-blower accused the agency of wrongfully destroying important investigative files, including “matters under inquiry,” or MUIs.  “We do not believe that current or future investigations have been harmed by the division’s old MUI retention policy,” said Khuzami, adding that data the agency did save electronically still lets the SEC “connect the dots” between current and closed matters.  Khuzami’s letter to Grassley is the latest twist in an ongoing saga that first began in July 2010 after Darcy Flynn, an agency lawyer, complained that important early-stage investigative records were being improperly discarded.  Flynn took his concerns to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which last month issued a statement declaring that the SEC had indeed destroyed the records without the proper authority. NARA noted, however, that the SEC had stopped destroying the records and was working with NARA on a new records retention policy.  Khuzami’s letter is a response to Grassley, who last month demanded answers from the SEC after learning of Flynn’s allegations about the MUI document destruction. Grassley had said that Flynn told him the records of major high-profile cases including Bernard Madoff, Goldman Sachs, trading in AIG credit-default swaps, alleged frauds at Wells Fargo and Bank of America, and insider-trading probes at Deutsche Bank, Lehman Brothers and the hedge fund SAC Capital.  More recently, a letter to the SEC from Flynn’s attorney, Gary Aguirre, also raised concerns documents from more formal investigations have also been discarded. The SEC has since ceased destroying all investigative records until further notice.  In Khuzami’s letter to Grassley, he downplayed the importance of some of the kinds of documents that may have been discarded.  An MUI is based on “readily available information” including public data, and the threshold for opening one “is low,” he said.  He added the SEC retained “significant information” concerning all MUIs through an electronic records system that dates back 20 years.  Moreover, the records from MUIs that become more formal investigations were retained. Only records from closed matters under inquiry were not stored as official files and in some cases discarded, he said.  Senator Grassley, in a statement late on Wednesday, sounded skeptical about Khuzami’s claims in the letter.  “Since the documents are gone, we’ll never know how important they might have been. How do you know whether you might have been helped by something you no longer have?” he asked. “Federal records are federal records and have to be preserved, regardless of whether they’re part of an ‘investigation’ or an ‘inquiry.’”  ",9152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-documents/sec-says-no-probes-hurt-by-destroyed-records-idUSTRE78D78L20110915
194,WFC,Citi introducing fees on low-balance bank accounts,"(Reuters) - Citigroup Inc said it will start charging a monthly fee on accounts with low balances, joining a growing list of banks seeking to recoup revenue lost under new regulations.  The $10 fee will be waived if a customer completes one direct deposit and one online bill payment per month through an account, or maintains a combined balance of $1,500 in checking and savings accounts, Citigroup said on Friday.  The change takes effect in December.  Citi’s change is part of a larger industry push toward regular maintenance fees for retail banking services, particularly for accounts with lower balances. Fees were previously tied to overdrafts and other customer missteps.  Under Citi’s current fee structure, customers are not required to maintain minimum account balances but must complete five monthly transactions to avoid a fee of $8.  Citigroup said it will not charge for debit card use or online bill payment.  Stephen Troutner, head of banking products for Citi’s U.S. consumer bank, said free debit card use could woo customers from other banks that are weighing whether to charge for debit card use, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co.  “Customers have told us in no uncertain terms that is a huge source of irritation,” Troutner said.  Some customers are growing weary of higher hurdles to avoid fees and are moving to credit unions and small banks that have not rolled out new fee programs, said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer research director at the Washington-based U.S. Public Interest Research Group.  “It’s just harder to achieve free now,” Mierzwinski said.  New York-based Citi is the latest bank to tinker with its fee structure following changes in U.S. consumer banking regulations and laws over the last two years.  New regulations — part of a broad financial sector reform effort — limit overdraft fees and other penalty fees banks can charge.  In response, many banks have begun introducing monthly service fees for accounts, debit card use and visits to branches.  Bank of America Corp, the largest U.S. bank by assets, added checking account fees last year. The BofA changes include an ebanking account, which allows customers to use ATMs and online banking for free but charges a monthly fee of $7 for teller visits or receiving paper statements.

196,WFC,RPT-INSIGHT-BofA cuts foretell a downturn in branch banking," (Repeats Thursday item to additional subscribers)   * New ATMs reduce need for tellers   * Online accounts reduce demand for branch employees   * BofA’s acquisition spree creates layoff opportunities   By Dan Wilchins and Joe Rauch   Sept 15 (Reuters) - To see why Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) can cut 30,000 jobs from its consumer banking business, just stop by one of the 14,000 new automatic teller machines it has installed over the last three years.   The machines scan checks and cash and allow deposits to be reflected in customer accounts the same day. A scanning ATM is faster and less prone to processing error than a teller.   Combined with the bank’s other efforts to shunt customers away from tellers, the ATMs will make many consumer banking personnel all but unnecessary.   Bank of America has about 95,000 employees in consumer and small business banking. To Chief Executive Brian Moynihan, this area, and retail banking in particular, may be the bank’s best opportunity for cutting costs.   The golden era of branch banking is over, analysts said.   “A branch system is simply becoming uneconomical,” said Nancy Bush, a bank analyst and contributing editor at SNL Financial.   Bush estimates the industry will need 20 percent fewer branches over time due to electronic banking advances and changing customer behavior. “It just makes no sense to have a huge network.”   For years, banks have raced to build and buy branches in a dash to grab as many deposits as possible.   But starting in 2010, the number of branches fell 1 percent to 98,507, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Many of the branches that remain are likely to be slimmed down. Banks may still want deposits, but they want them cheap.   Bank of America is one of many banks that is likely to lay off retail banking staff. Analysts said Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) for example, is likely to follow a similar strategy.   A Wells Fargo spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment.   Shuttering branches and laying off retail staff is a fast way to cut costs, and Bank of America’s Moynihan needs quick fixes.   The biggest U.S. bank has lost more than $12 billion over the last five quarters, hurt by bad mortgages and related litigation, and its shares have lost nearly half their value this year.   The bank has deployed about 50 executives to review over 150,000 proposals for restructuring the bank, in a program known as the “New BAC.” The name refers to the bank’s stock symbol.   On Monday, the bank announced plans to cut 30,000 jobs from its range of consumer business units over the next several years as part of the first phase of New BAC.

197,WFC,"UPDATE 1-Labor Dept. bends on 401(k) rule, insurers cheer"," * US agency will repropose plan for a fiduciary standard   * IRA advice will likely be included in reproposal   * Bipartisan legislators pushed for pullback   (Adds details about upcoming proposal, industry reaction)   By Suzanne Barlyn and Jessica Toonkel   Sept 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Labor on Monday withdrew a controversial proposal to subject financial professionals to a higher standard of care when advising companies on their retirement plans.   The Labor Department, which has jurisdiction over retirement plans, said it will repropose the rule early next year. As currently written, it would have imposed a fiduciary standard that requires brokers and other advisers to put their clients’ interests first as opposed to merely providing suitable advice.   But a new proposal, expected from the agency in early 2012, will likely include advice about individual retirement accounts under the fiduciary definition, a Labor Department spokesman told Reuters on Monday.   Industry groups argued against including IRAs in the most recent proposal, because doing so would restrict brokerages from collecting commissions without extensive disclosure. The groups argued that would make financial advice less accessible to Main Street investors.   The initial proposal drew darts from numerous lawmakers, insurers and securities industry lobbying groups, including the National Association of Insurance Financial Advisors and the Financial Services Institute who feared their salespeople would have to limit the products they could suggest for retirement plans.   Various groups argued that retirement plan participants would see investment costs rise under the standard. They also said the Labor Department proposal would likely conflict with a separate fiduciary rule that the Securities and Exchange Commission is planning to govern brokers who give investment advice to individual clients.   The pension plan proposal also would have forced big brokerage firms such as Bank of America’s (BAC.N) Merrill Lynch & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co.’s (WFC.N) Wells Fargo Advisors to decide whether to limit their brokers from working with corporate retirement plans.   The Labor Department rule would not only limit brokers’ ability to recommend their companies’ own products to employers but prohibit them from collecting commissions from investment companies when employees purchase their funds or other retirement plan products without providing extensive disclosure.   “We have said all along that we will take the time to get this right,” Phyllis Borzi, assistant secretary of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration and chief architect of the proposed rule, said in a statement.   “Investment advisers shouldn’t be able to steer retirees, workers, small businesses and others into investments that benefit the advisers at the expense of their clients,” she said.   Industry groups applauded the decision. “This proposal went much further than anything the SEC is thinking of doing under its uniform fiduciary standard,” said Dale Brown, president and CEO of the Financial Services Institute, which represents independent broker-dealers.   Wells Fargo Advisors, a unit of Wells Fargo Corp. (WFC.N),and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, a joint venture between Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Citigroup (C.N), also commended the decision.   The political winds began blowing against the proposal when the broker-dealers began arguing that it would restrict their ability to sell Individual Retirement Accounts to investors.   Representative Barney Frank, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee and co-sponsor of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, last Thursday urged Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis to re-propose the rule in concert with fiduciary changes and other business conduct standards being studied by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.   The Department of Labor’s decision was surprising particularly because in Congressional hearings in August, Borzi was adamant about going forward with the proposal, said Jason Roberts, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Pension Resources Institute.   “It speaks volumes to the pressure the Department has gotten about this,” Roberts said.   Declaring victory, however, is premature, said Brian Graff, executive director and chief executive of the American Society of Pension Professionals and Actuaries.   “There is nothing in the DoL release to suggest that they are backing down from the big issue—which is really the application of the rule to IRAs,” he said.

199,WFC,"Jefferies Q3 signals tough times at Goldman, others","(Reuters) - Jefferies Group Inc’s JEF.N quarterly revenue dipped 2 percent, hurt by a tough trading environment, but the mid-sized investment bank raised its buyback program to 20 million shares.  As the first investment bank to report results, Jefferies is often viewed as an indicator for larger Wall Street firms such as Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).  “There are no surprises in Jefferies numbers relative to what others are going to produce. You don’t know how bad it’s going to be, all you know is that it’s going to be very bad,” Richard Bove, analyst with Rochdale Securities told Reuters.  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also expected to post lower trading revenues as volatility in the wake of the U.S. rating downgrade and European debt default concerns pushed clients to sit on the sidelines, reducing commission income and lose money on principal investments.  JPMorgan Chase & Co’s (JPM.N) trading revenue is running 30 percent lower this quarter than the previous period, while investment banking fees are likely to fall by about 50 percent, a senior executive said last week.  Goldman Sachs may report a $1.6 billion market-to-market loss on its principal investments, an analyst at Atlantic Equities had said last week.  Revenue at Jefferies fell nearly 2 percent to $509.2 million, hurt by a loss of $74 million from trades the bank made on its own account.  For the quarter ended August 31, Jefferies posted a profit for common shareholders of $68.2 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with $44.8 million, or 22 cents a share, a year ago.  Much of the profit came from the company’s nearly $500 million buy of Prudential Bache from Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N).  Excluding the acquisition, Jefferies earned 10 cents a share.  Jefferies has been aggressively courting talent from Wall Street giants for over a year and has hired more than a dozen senior bankers, traders, analysts and strategists from competitors like Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup (C.N), PIMCO and Blackstone Group LP (BX.N).  “The company is going through a substantial expansion program at a period when the markets are contracting dramatically...if they can’t get their revenue to go up because the markets aren’t going to go up, their earnings are going to be squeezed terribly (in the future),” Bove said.  Jefferies said its board has approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 20 million shares, inclusive of prior authorizations.

203,WFC,"Labor Department bends on 401(k) rule, insurers cheer","(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Labor on Monday withdrew a controversial proposal to subject financial professionals to a higher standard of care when advising companies on their retirement plans.  The Labor Department, which has jurisdiction over retirement plans, said it will repropose the rule early next year. As currently written, it would have imposed a fiduciary standard that requires brokers and other advisers to put their clients’ interests first as opposed to merely providing suitable advice.  But a new proposal, expected from the agency in early 2012, will likely include advice about individual retirement accounts under the fiduciary definition, a Labor Department spokesman told Reuters on Monday.  Industry groups argued against including IRAs in the most recent proposal, because doing so would restrict brokerages from collecting commissions without extensive disclosure. The groups argued that would make financial advice less accessible to Main Street investors.  The initial proposal drew darts from numerous lawmakers, insurers and securities industry lobbying groups, including the National Association of Insurance Financial Advisors and the Financial Services Institute who feared their salespeople would have to limit the products they could suggest for retirement plans.  Various groups argued that retirement plan participants would see investment costs rise under the standard. They also said the Labor Department proposal would likely conflict with a separate fiduciary rule that the Securities and Exchange Commission is planning to govern brokers who give investment advice to individual clients.  The pension plan proposal also would have forced big brokerage firms such as Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co.’s Wells Fargo Advisors to decide whether to limit their brokers from working with corporate retirement plans.  The Labor Department rule would not only limit brokers’ ability to recommend their companies’ own products to employers but prohibit them from collecting commissions from investment companies when employees purchase their funds or other retirement plan products without providing extensive disclosure.  “We have said all along that we will take the time to get this right,” Phyllis Borzi, assistant secretary of the Labor Department’s Employee Benefits Security Administration and chief architect of the proposed rule, said in a statement.  “Investment advisers shouldn’t be able to steer retirees, workers, small businesses and others into investments that benefit the advisers at the expense of their clients,” she said.  Industry groups applauded the decision. “This proposal went much further than anything the SEC is thinking of doing under its uniform fiduciary standard,” said Dale Brown, president and CEO of the Financial Services Institute, which represents independent broker-dealers.  Wells Fargo Advisors, a unit of Wells Fargo Corp.,and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, a joint venture between Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, also commended the decision.  The political winds began blowing against the proposal when the broker-dealers began arguing that it would restrict their ability to sell Individual Retirement Accounts to investors.  Representative Barney Frank, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee and co-sponsor of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, last Thursday urged Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis to re-propose the rule in concert with fiduciary changes and other business conduct standards being studied by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The Department of Labor’s decision was surprising particularly because in Congressional hearings in August, Borzi was adamant about going forward with the proposal, said Jason Roberts, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Pension Resources Institute.  “It speaks volumes to the pressure the Department has gotten about this,” Roberts said.  Declaring victory, however, is premature, said Brian Graff, executive director and chief executive of the American Society of Pension Professionals and Actuaries.  “There is nothing in the DoL release to suggest that they are backing down from the big issue—which is really the application of the rule to IRAs,” he said.

204,WFC,Moody's downgrades big banks on changed policy,"(Reuters) - Moody’s Investors Service lowered debt ratings for Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co on Wednesday, saying the U.S. government is getting less comfortable with bailing out large troubled lenders.  The government is “more likely now than during the financial crisis to allow a large bank to fail should it become financially troubled,” said the rating agency, a unit of Moody’s Corp.  “This is crystallizing the fact we’re in a new political reality,” said Jason Ware, equity analyst with Salt Lake City-based Albion Financial Group.  Moody’s decision hit Bank of America hardest, as it downgraded the long- and short-term debt of the holding company and long-term deposits at its main banking unit.  The ratings agency downgraded only short-term debt at Citigroup and limited the Wells’ cut to its senior debt and to deposits at its lead bank.  Bank of America is struggling with billions of dollars of mortgage losses, litigation and stresses from the need to raise capital to meet new regulatory obligations.  After Moody’s downgrade, the cost to insure $10 million of Bank of America’s debt for 5 years in the credit default swap market rose 48 basis points to $378,000 per year.  But analysts and investors said the downgrade was likely to have little immediate impact on Bank of America’s business.  “It certainly doesn’t look good, but operationally it shouldn’t affect them that much,” said Jon Finger, managing partner of Finger Interests Number One Ltd, a Houston-based investment firm that owns Bank of America shares.  The risk of contagion from one failing bank to other banks has “become less acute,” Moody’s noted, adding the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010 reduced the ties among financial institutions.  When investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc failed in September 2008, its debt and counterparty obligations created shockwaves throughout the global financial system.  The banks’ ratings could be cut further if pending provisions in Dodd-Frank designed to stop too-big-to-fail bailouts are fully implemented, said Sean Jones, senior vice president in Moody’s financial institutions group.  Moody’s had signaled it might downgrade the three banks’ ratings in June.  JPMorgan Chase & Co, which is roughly the same size by assets as Bank of America, but considered healthier, was not part of the review.  Bank of America shares closed 7.5 percent down at $6.38 on the New York Stock Exchange. Citigroup shares were down $1.41, or about 5.2 percent, at $25.52, and Wells Fargo shares slid 96 cents to $23.71.  Despite the cuts for Bank of America, analysts at CreditSights Inc, a research service for institutional investors described the cuts to Wells Fargo ratings as “more cosmetic” and Citigroup’s as “a housekeeping item.”  Wells Fargo’s holding company senior debt was lowered only one notch to “A2” from “A1.” Citigroup’s short-term rating for the holding company was changed to “Prime-2,” which Moody’s noted is typical for companies with the same long-term rating as Citigroup.  The holding company’s short-term rating had been exceptionally high because those creditors benefited the most from government support during the financial crisis, Moody’s said.  Moody’s changed only the short-term rating of the Citigroup holding company and left in place its ratings on the holding company’s long-term debt, as well its short- and long-term ratings on the main Citibank subsidiary.  Moody’s said the long-term outlook on the three banks’ ratings remains negative.  Wells Fargo responded with a statement noting Moody’s actions on some of its obligations reflected a change in the agency’s view of government support, as opposed to a new opinion of the bank itself.  Bank of America said through a spokesman that the downgrade was due to forces beyond its control and asserted it has a healthy liquidity cushion of $400 billion. All of its planned borrowing needs have been prefunded for the rest of 2011, the spokesman said.  Citigroup said in a statement that Moody’s downgrade affects less than 1 percent of its funding. The decision will not affect its funding needs, it said.  Moody’s announcement is a victory for supporters of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law, who have argued that the legislation ends the government’s ability to bail out failing banks.  Representative Barney Frank, one of the law’s two primary authors, and former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair have been most outspoken in arguing the only way a bailout could occur is for Congress to change the law.  “I can’t comment on the absolute value of Moody’s ratings, but I am pleased that the rating agency recognizes that such large institutions are not ‘too big to fail,’” Frank said in a prepared statement.

207,WFC,"Wall Street sinks 3 percent after Fed cites economic ""risks""","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks suffered their worst drop in a month after the Federal Reserve said there were “significant downside risks” to the economy even as it took another stab at boosting growth.  Selling accelerated as volume spiked in the last hour of trading, with banks and insurers leading the decline, as the KBW Bank index .BKX slid 5.5 percent and the KBW Insurance index .KIX off 5.2 percent. Bank of America (BAC.N) lost 7.5 percent to $6.38 and Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) slid 6.6 percent to $45.73.  The Fed, as expected, said it would buy more long-term Treasury securities in an effort to lower borrowing rates. But investors worry that the Fed’s latest plan will have little effect on lending in an economy that appears to be stagnating, which the Fed also noted.  “That was probably the biggest statement when he said ‘significant downside risks,’” said Alan Valdes, director of floor operations for DME Securities in New York. “Considering we’ve done over $1 trillion, and it hasn’t moved the needle at all,” he added, referring to the Fed’s previous stimulus efforts.  Traders attributed the late-day drop to investors pulling back from bets made during last week’s rally, and new short positions after the market failed to rise on the Fed news.  The Fed’s $400 billion plan, dubbed “Operation Twist” by market participants, is the latest in a series of steps aimed at reviving an economy that has struggled to rebound from the 2008 financial crisis. Investors are less optimistic after previous efforts, particularly in light of the Fed’s own statement pointing to economic risks.  Insurers were some of the hardest-hit names as Operation Twist could threaten the earnings of some of the country’s largest insurers for years to come.  The KBW Insurance Index .KIX lost 5.2 percent, led by Lincoln National (LNC.N), which dropped 8.4 percent to $16.63. Insurers’ investment portfolios are going to have a hard time keeping up with their obligations if the Fed successfully keeps rates at very low levels.  “Investment yields are going to remain low and life insurers, in particular, are leveraged to the market directly and indirectly through their investment portfolio and the annuities that they’ve sold,” Morningstar insurance analyst Drew Woodbury said.  The Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT, seen as a proxy for economic health, fell 5.3 percent. Railroad Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N) slid 8.3 percent to $61.93.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 283.82 points, or 2.49 percent, to 11,124.84. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX lost 35.33 points, or 2.94 percent, to 1,166.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 52.05 points, or 2.01 percent, to 2,538.19.  The Fed will tilt its $2.85 trillion balance sheet more heavily to longer-term securities by selling shorter-term notes and using those funds to buy longer-dated Treasuries.  Traders also said until the Fed news there was a risk the Fed might surprise with more aggressive efforts than expected. With the plan details now known — and it appearing to be an extension of previous efforts — pessimistic types felt more secure in betting on more declines.  “Market participants have been operating with a fear of potential good news and the news today basically took that fear off the table, it allowed the shorts to aggressively come back into the market,” said Michael Marrale, managing director and head of sales trading at RBC Capital Markets in New York.  The Fed said economic growth remains slow, and recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Moody’s Corp (MCO.N) cut the debt ratings of Bank of America Corp, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), saying the U.S. government is getting less comfortable with bailing out large troubled lenders.  There were a few bright spots in the tech sector.  Oracle Corp ORCL.O gained 4.2 percent to $29.54 a day after forecasting higher-than-expected earnings for the current quarter as well as robust sales. Earlier, Oracle climbed to $30.96, nearly an 8-week high.  Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) shares jumped 6.6 percent to $23.96 after a source familiar with the matter said the company’s board is considering ousting Chief Executive Officer Leo Apotheker after less than a year on the job, and replacing him temporarily with former eBay (EBAY.O) CEO Meg Whitman.

208,WFC,US STOCKS-Wall St sinks 3 pct after Fed cites economic 'risks'," * Fed set to buy long-dated debt as U.S. outlook dims   * Late-day selling led by banks, insurers   * Transports fall sharply on clouded economic picture   * Dow off 2.5 pct, S&P off 2.9 pct, Nasdaq off 2 pct * For up-to-the-minute market news see [STXNEWS/US]  (Adds graph on banks, quote, updates bullets, volume)   By Chuck Mikolajczak   NEW YORK, Sept 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks suffered their worst drop in a month after the Federal Reserve said there were “significant downside risks” to the economy even as it took another stab at boosting growth.   Selling accelerated as volume spiked in the last hour of trading, with banks and insurers leading the decline, as the KBW Bank index .BKX slid 5.5 percent and the KBW Insurance index .KIX off 5.2 percent.  Bank of America (BAC.N) lost 7.5 percent to $6.38 and Prudential Financial Inc (PRU.N) slid 6.6 percent to $45.73.   The Fed, as expected, said it would buy more long-term Treasury securities in an effort to lower borrowing rates. But investors worry that the Fed’s latest plan will have little effect on lending in an economy that appears to be stagnating, which the Fed also noted.   “That was probably the biggest statement when he said ‘significant downside risks,’” said Alan Valdes, director of floor operations for DME Securities in New York. “Considering we’ve done over $1 trillion, and it hasn’t moved the needle at all,” he added, referring to the Fed’s previous stimulus efforts.   Traders attributed the late-day drop to investors pulling back from bets made during last week’s rally, and new short positions after the market failed to rise on the Fed news.   The Fed’s $400 billion plan, dubbed “Operation Twist” by market participants, is the latest in a series of steps aimed at reviving an economy that has struggled to rebound from the 2008 financial crisis. Investors are less optimistic after previous efforts, particularly in light of the Fed’s own statement pointing to economic risks.   Insurers were some of the hardest-hit names as Operation Twist could threaten the earnings of some of the country’s largest insurers for years to come. [ID:nS1E78F1A4]   The KBW Insurance Index .KIX lost 5.2 percent, led by Lincoln National (LNC.N), which dropped 8.4 percent to $16.63. Insurers’ investment portfolios are going to have a hard time keeping up with their obligations if the Fed successfully keeps rates at very low levels.   “Investment yields are going to remain low and life insurers, in particular, are leveraged to the market directly and indirectly through their investment portfolio and the annuities that they’ve sold,” Morningstar insurance analyst Drew Woodbury said.   The Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT, seen as a proxy for economic health, fell 5.3 percent. Railroad Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N) slid 8.3 percent to $61.93.   The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 283.82 points, or 2.49 percent, to 11,124.84. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX lost 35.33 points, or 2.94 percent, to 1,166.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 52.05 points, or 2.01 percent, to 2,538.19.   The Fed will tilt its $2.85 trillion balance sheet more heavily to longer-term securities by selling shorter-term notes and using those funds to buy longer-dated Treasuries. For details, see [ID:nS1E78J25W]   Traders also said until the Fed news there was a risk the Fed might surprise with more aggressive efforts than expected. With the plan details now known — and it appearing to be an extension of previous efforts — pessimistic types felt more secure in betting on more declines.   “Market participants have been operating with a fear of potential good news and the news today basically took that fear off the table, it allowed the shorts to aggressively come back into the market,” said Michael Marrale, managing director and head of sales trading at RBC Capital Markets in New York.   The Fed said economic growth remains slow, and recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.   Moody’s Corp (MCO.N) cut the debt ratings of Bank of America Corp, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), saying the U.S. government is getting less comfortable with bailing out large troubled lenders. [ID:nS1E78K16B]   There were a few bright spots in the tech sector.   Oracle Corp ORCL.O gained 4.2 percent to $29.54 a day after forecasting higher-than-expected earnings for the current quarter as well as robust sales. Earlier, Oracle climbed to $30.96, nearly an 8-week high. [ID:nS1E78J1PI]   Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) shares jumped 6.6 percent to $23.96 after a source familiar with the matter said the company’s board is considering ousting Chief Executive Officer Leo Apotheker after less than a year on the job, and replacing him temporarily with former eBay (EBAY.O) CEO Meg Whitman.

210,WFC,Basel rules level bank playing field-Fed official," * Fed official says Basel will be tough on all banks   * Clearing House releases study against surcharge   By Dave Clarke and Alexandra Alper   WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - New international capital standards will not put the largest U.S. banks at a competitive disadvantage against their foreign competitors, a top Federal Reserve official said on Thursday.   Large U.S. banks have complained that while the standards are intended to apply internationally, they will be a step too far for large U.S. institutions already facing new regulatory requirements under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law.   Banking leaders, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, contend regulators are not weighing the cumulative impact of all regulations. They have been particularly critical of the stricter capital standards that the largest banks will have to meet as part of the Basel III international regulatory agreement.   Mark Van Der Weide, a senior staff member at the Federal Reserve’s Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, said Basel negotiators did not develop the capital standards in “a vacuum” and took into account the various new rules banks are facing both in the United States and elsewhere.   He said certain aspects of the Basel agreement, such as how mortgage servicing rights are treated, may be harder on U.S. banks. Other aspects of the deal, such as a new leverage ratio, will weigh more heavily on banks headquartered in Europe or elsewhere, he said.   “We can keep the playing field relatively level,” Van Der Weide said at a conference hosted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Georgetown University. He added he was voicing his own opinion, not official Fed policy.   The Basel agreement will require banks to maintain top-quality capital equal to 7 percent of their risk-bearing assets.   On top of that, global “systemic” banks may have to hold up to an additional 2.5 percent buffer. Another 1 percent surcharge would be imposed if a bank became significantly bigger.   The heads of the Group of 20 leading and emerging economies are expected to give final approval to these rules in November and then it would be up to each country to implement them.   The banking industry is mounting an intense lobbying campaign against the section of the Basel agreement that would require the world’s biggest banks to hold more capital.   Banking executives and their lobbying groups contend the higher standards would result in less lending, which in turn would hurt the economy.   Regulators and other supporters of higher capital standards have countered that the economy would benefit from a sounder financial system and that the industry is overstating the impact of the rules on lending.   On Thursday the Clearing House, a group representing large international banks, released a study arguing against the additional capital charge on large banks.   The group contends that the minimum capital standards for all banks required by Basel III would make the largest institutions sound enough to weather future economic or market storms.   The group represents institutions such as Citigroup (C.N), JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N).

213,WFC,Moody's downgrades big banks on changed policy,"(Reuters) - Moody’s Investors Service lowered debt ratings for Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co on Wednesday, saying the U.S. government is getting less comfortable with bailing out large troubled lenders.  The government is “more likely now than during the financial crisis to allow a large bank to fail should it become financially troubled,” said the rating agency, a unit of Moody’s Corp.  “This is crystallizing the fact we’re in a new political reality,” said Jason Ware, equity analyst with Salt Lake City-based Albion Financial Group.  Moody’s decision hit Bank of America hardest, as it downgraded the long- and short-term debt of the holding company and long-term deposits at its main banking unit.  The ratings agency downgraded only short-term debt at Citigroup and limited the Wells’ cut to its senior debt and to deposits at its lead bank.  Bank of America is struggling with billions of dollars of mortgage losses, litigation and stresses from the need to raise capital to meet new regulatory obligations.  After Moody’s downgrade, the cost to insure $10 million of Bank of America’s debt for 5 years in the credit default swap market rose 48 basis points to $378,000 per year.  But analysts and investors said the downgrade was likely to have little immediate impact on Bank of America’s business.  “It certainly doesn’t look good, but operationally it shouldn’t affect them that much,” said Jon Finger, managing partner of Finger Interests Number One Ltd, a Houston-based investment firm that owns Bank of America shares.  The risk of contagion from one failing bank to other banks has “become less acute,” Moody’s noted, adding the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010 reduced the ties among financial institutions.  When investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc failed in September 2008, its debt and counterparty obligations created shockwaves throughout the global financial system.  The banks’ ratings could be cut further if pending provisions in Dodd-Frank designed to stop too-big-to-fail bailouts are fully implemented, said Sean Jones, senior vice president in Moody’s financial institutions group.  Moody’s had signaled it might downgrade the three banks’ ratings in June.  JPMorgan Chase & Co, which is roughly the same size by assets as Bank of America, but considered healthier, was not part of the review.  Bank of America shares closed 7.5 percent down at $6.38 on the New York Stock Exchange. Citigroup shares were down $1.41, or about 5.2 percent, at $25.52, and Wells Fargo shares slid 96 cents to $23.71.  Despite the cuts for Bank of America, analysts at CreditSights Inc, a research service for institutional investors described the cuts to Wells Fargo ratings as “more cosmetic” and Citigroup’s as “a housekeeping item.”  Wells Fargo’s holding company senior debt was lowered only one notch to “A2” from “A1.” Citigroup’s short-term rating for the holding company was changed to “Prime-2,” which Moody’s noted is typical for companies with the same long-term rating as Citigroup.  The holding company’s short-term rating had been exceptionally high because those creditors benefited the most from government support during the financial crisis, Moody’s said.  Moody’s changed only the short-term rating of the Citigroup holding company and left in place its ratings on the holding company’s long-term debt, as well its short- and long-term ratings on the main Citibank subsidiary.  Moody’s said the long-term outlook on the three banks’ ratings remains negative.  Wells Fargo responded with a statement noting Moody’s actions on some of its obligations reflected a change in the agency’s view of government support, as opposed to a new opinion of the bank itself.  Bank of America said through a spokesman that the downgrade was due to forces beyond its control and asserted it has a healthy liquidity cushion of $400 billion. All of its planned borrowing needs have been prefunded for the rest of 2011, the spokesman said.  Citigroup said in a statement that Moody’s downgrade affects less than 1 percent of its funding. The decision will not affect its funding needs, it said.  Moody’s announcement is a victory for supporters of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law, who have argued that the legislation ends the government’s ability to bail out failing banks.  Representative Barney Frank, one of the law’s two primary authors, and former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair have been most outspoken in arguing the only way a bailout could occur is for Congress to change the law.  “I can’t comment on the absolute value of Moody’s ratings, but I am pleased that the rating agency recognizes that such large institutions are not ‘too big to fail,’” Frank said in a prepared statement.

214,WFC,Thiel puts brand on Merrill with shake-up,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - John Thiel has moved out of Sallie Krawcheck’s shadow, slashing Merrill Lynch manager jobs and taking steps to more closely align the firm’s retail brokers and private bankers.  Thiel, who was named head of Merrill’s U.S. wealth management by Krawcheck in April, eliminated more than half of the brokerage’s manager jobs on Wednesday, replacing three division heads and 24 regional bosses with 11 “market leaders” who will oversee both private banking and brokerage.  The move comes two weeks after Krawcheck — who arrived with great fanfare in 2009 — was ousted by Bank of America (BAC.N) Chief Executive Brian Moynihan.  Regional managers will oversee both the private banking and investment group (or PBIG) and the brokerage in each region, while ensuring their marketing efforts are coordinated and not in conflict.  Eliminating the parallel ranks of managers means one market leader will be responsible for delivering different products and strategies to different kinds of clients around the country. In theory, that will foster greater cooperation between the two groups of advisers.  That could address a challenge faced by banks that have separate advisers groups competing for the same clients.  Although many of Merrill’s retail brokers have multimillionaire clients, the firm created the private banking arm in 2000 to attract ultra-wealthy clients who might otherwise go to a top-shelf wealth manager. PBIG, as it is known, has about 310 private wealth advisers.  Merrill’s “Thundering Herd” of roughly 13,000 U.S. brokers generally serve clients with more than $250,000 to invest. The wealth management group oversaw $1.54 trillion as of June 30; the firm does not disclose its private banking assets.  Rivals Morgan Stanley (MS.N), UBS AG (UBS.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) also are working to develop businesses that appeal to different strata of wealth.  Thiel said the flatter management structure allows him keep closer tabs on clients and their demands.  “It’s a structure that recognizes the differences from market to market and empowers managers, based on those differences, to design a growth plan that works for their advisors, their clients and, ultimately our company,” Thiel said in a memo Wednesday.  Thiel, a veteran Merrill adviser, rose through the ranks over two decades. In 2005, he took the helm at the firm’s private banking business for investors with at least $10 million.  The April promotion gave Thiel, 51, oversight of both the high net-worth business and Merrill’s army of brokers.  “John Thiel is shaping Merrill the way he sees it,” said a recruiter who asked to remain anonymous because he does business with Merrill. “He’s become more empowered.”  Merrill spokeswoman Selena Morris said the new structure increases ownership and accountability at the local level.  “It actually spreads power out, not consolidates it,” Morris said.  Brokerages searching for savings have long targeted managers since they do not generally produce revenue. Morgan Stanley (MS.N), eliminated dozens of managers when it combined its brokerage with Citigroup’s (C.N) Smith Barney in 2009.  Aite Group analyst Alois Pirker, who met with Thiel Wednesday after the changes were announced, said the changes could make Merrill more responsive to customers.  “This will get them ahead of the curve, to make them more relevant to customers,” said Pirker, whose company tracks the wealth management business. “Markets are changing very rapidly and you’re going to be able to influence that development by being closer to the markets.”  But these separate high-end businesses also generate resentment. Many retail brokers manage very rich clients and do not like their work being viewed as downscale.  The new responsibilities could also overload managers who supervise advisers, say recruiters, impeding their ability to monitor broker activities and reducing the time they can spend helping advisers expand their practices.  “Managers at the big firms exist to take care of advisers and make sure the stay in compliance. It isn’t clear if you can still service your adviser effectively with fewer managers,” said recruiter Danny Sarch of Leitner Sarch Consultants.  The sweeping reorganization also creates more uncertainty in a firm still dealing with Krawcheck’s sudden ouster and the ongoing financial and legal woes of its parent company.  “I’m not sure how this reorganization solves anything. It’s shifting chairs around the Titanic,” said Richard Schwarzkopf, a New York area recruiter. “I don’t think it fixes anything beyond saving money, and that might prove short-sighted.”  Bank of America has faced numerous lawsuits and regulatory actions over its mortgage lending practices during the housing boom. Mounting bills, including an agreement to pay $8.5 billion to investors in mortgage backed securities — have forced the bank to slash 30,000 jobs and cut other costs.

217,WFC,Thiel puts his brand on Merrill with shake-up," * Management changes show new boss Thiel taking charge   * Upheaval comes as brokers deal with other uncertainties   By Joseph A. Giannone   NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - John Thiel has moved out of Sallie Krawcheck’s shadow, slashing Merrill Lynch manager jobs and taking steps to more closely align the firm’s retail brokers and private bankers.   Thiel, who was named head of Merrill’s U.S. wealth management by Krawcheck in April, eliminated more than half of the brokerage’s manager jobs on Wednesday, replacing three division heads and 24 regional bosses with 11 “market leaders” who will oversee both private banking and brokerage.   The move comes two weeks after Krawcheck — who arrived with great fanfare in 2009 — was ousted by Bank of America (BAC.N) Chief Executive Brian Moynihan.   Regional managers will oversee both the private banking and investment group (or PBIG) and the brokerage in each region, while ensuring their marketing efforts are coordinated and not in conflict.   Eliminating the parallel ranks of managers means one market leader will be responsible for delivering different products and strategies to different kinds of clients around the country. In theory, that will foster greater cooperation between the two groups of advisers.   That could address a challenge faced by banks that have separate advisers groups competing for the same clients.   Although many of Merrill’s retail brokers have multimillionaire clients, the firm created the private banking arm in 2000 to attract ultra-wealthy clients who might otherwise go to a top-shelf wealth manager. PBIG, as it is known, has about 310 private wealth advisers.   Merrill’s “Thundering Herd” of roughly 13,000 U.S. brokers generally serve clients with more than $250,000 to invest. The wealth management group oversaw $1.54 trillion as of June 30; the firm does not disclose its private banking assets.   Rivals Morgan Stanley (MS.N), UBS AG (UBS.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) also are working to develop businesses that appeal to different strata of wealth.   Thiel said the flatter management structure allows him keep closer tabs on clients and their demands.   “It’s a structure that recognizes the differences from market to market and empowers managers, based on those differences, to design a growth plan that works for their advisors, their clients and, ultimately our company,” Thiel said in a memo Wednesday.   Thiel, a veteran Merrill adviser, rose through the ranks over two decades. In 2005, he took the helm at the firm’s private banking business for investors with at least $10 million.   The April promotion gave Theil, 51, oversight of both the high net-worth business and Merrill’s army of brokers.   “John Thiel is shaping Merrill the way he sees it,” said a recruiter who asked to remain anonymous because he does business with Merrill. “He’s become more empowered.”    Brokerages searching for savings have long targeted managers since they do not generally produce revenue. Morgan Stanley (MS.N), eliminated dozens of managers when it combined its brokerage with Citigroup’s (C.N) Smith Barney in 2009.   Aite Group analyst Alois Pirker, who met with Thiel Wednesday after the changes were announced, said the changes could make Merrill more responsive to customers.   “This will get them ahead of the curve, to make them more relevant to customers,” said Pirker, whose company tracks the wealth management business. “Markets are changing very rapidly and you’re going to be able to influence that development by being closer to the markets.”   But these separate high-end businesses also generate resentment. Many retail brokers manage very rich clients and do not like their work being viewed as downscale.   The new responsibilities could also overload managers who supervise advisers, say recruiters, impeding their ability to monitor broker activities and reducing the time they can spend helping advisers expand their practices.   “Managers at the big firms exist to take care of advisers and make sure the stay in compliance. It isn’t clear if you can still service your adviser effectively with fewer managers,” said recruiter Danny Sarch of Leitner Sarch Consultants.   The sweeping reorganization also creates more uncertainty in a firm still dealing with Krawcheck’s sudden ouster and the ongoing financial and legal woes of its parent company.   “I’m not sure how this reorganization solves anything. It’s shifting chairs around the Titanic,” said Richard Schwarzkopf, a New York area recruiter. “I don’t think it fixes anything beyond saving money, and that might prove short-sighted.”   Bank of America has faced numerous lawsuits and regulatory actions over its mortgage lending practices during the housing boom. Mounting bills, including an agreement to pay $8.5 billion to investors in mortgage backed securities — have forced the bank to slash 30,000 jobs and cut other costs.

218,WFC,DealTalk: Small may be beautiful for UBS investment bank,"LONDON (Reuters) - UBS UBSN.VX may have to give up its cherished place among the world’s top investment banks, scaling back to focus on wealth management and exiting many of the higher-risk trading businesses where it has made heavy investments.  As Chief Executive Oswald Gruebel battles to preserve the investment bank — and perhaps his own future — some of his own senior bankers, as well as peers at rival firms say UBS could look very different in just two years time.  They predict that the Swiss firm will refocus around its core private bank, still the world’s third-largest, and give up much of its fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) business, where profits can be volatile.  “We’re looking for a structural solution to UBS’s problems. It makes sense for them to scale back FICC, which they started rebuilding at the wrong point in the cycle,” said Matthew Czepliewicz, banking analyst with Collins Stewart.  A $2.3 billion trading loss discovered earlier this month, has brought UBS’s future back to the fore, though doubts about its strategy date back much further.  In 2009, FICC was a profit machine for the likes of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) because companies flocked back to the bond markets to borrow in the wake of the financial crisis.  UBS hired hundreds of bankers last year, by which point income investment banks were generating from this business was already on the wane.  Stringent new capital rules are forcing banks to nurture more predictable businesses like wealth management, which are less capital intensive than investment banking. But this means they will struggle to recoup fat returns in FICC.[ID:nL6E7J31GX]  The rogue trading loss may force UBS to take further action to rein in costs on top of the 3,500 job cuts already announced, analysts and bankers have said.  Less risky areas within UBS’s investment bank, such as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) advisory are likely to be much less affected by any future scaling down.  The head of international business at a large private bank that competes with UBS predicted that the Swiss firm would evolve into a middle market investment bank, to service rich wealth management clients.  Others say that UBS could also exit some overseas markets to focus on its European roots. U.S. bank Wells Fargo (WFC.N) has been mooted as a suitor for UBS’s business in the United States, for example.  UBS’s banking operations grew up around wealth management and the clients of this business often need the same type of service as large companies, albeit on a smaller scale. But that isn’t always an easy match.  “There is the demand there, the (wealth management) clients want to have that (investment banking) capability because some of them are quasi institutions,” the rival private banker said.  “But quite often in size terms these clients are below the radar of where the investment bank wants to get in.”  Few believe that UBS would shut down or sell all of the investment bank in the near future unless it is explicitly told to do so by regulators, as a move like that would destroy shareholder value, one UBS insider said.  And some within the bank maintain UBS is committed to its goal of competing with major banks across the world for large-ticket corporate business.  “UBS wants to compete with Deutsche, Goldman, Citi and Merrill and we are not there yet. Our platform is still much smaller than, say, Deutsche’s,” a senior UBS banker said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  But the speculation about a full-scale retreat from investment banking has now emerged, along with other radical options, such as merging the investment bank with Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) or cross-town rival Credit Suisse CSGN.VX.  One banker dismissed such talk as “crazy” because there is too much overlap between Deutsche. The latter might covet UBS’s private bank, but the Swiss consider that the heart of UBS’s business. Similar arguments apply to Credit Suisse.  The markets are widely anticipating an update on the future of the investment bank and its head Carsten Kengeter from a board meeting in Singapore that has been extended beyond Friday into the weekend.  “There’s still big decisions on the agenda that haven’t been made yet,” Sarasin analyst Rainer Skierka said.

220,WFC,BofA CDS costs rise after record high Thursday close,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The cost to insure U.S. bank debt rose on Friday and Bank of America’s debt protection costs rose over their record closing levels on increasing concern with bank funding costs and the prospect of declining profits if the economy tips back into recession.  Nervousness over bank credit has increased since Moody’s Investors Service on Wednesday cut its credit ratings on Bank of America (BAC.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N).  The Federal Reserve’s new program to buy longer-dated Treasuries and sell shorter-dated debt has increased fears over bank profits as the prospect of recession appears more likely and as a flatter yield curve threatens to further damage banks’ ability to generate returns.

222,WFC,UBS's new CEO commits to keeping U.S. brokerage,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - UBS AG’s UBSN.VXtop two executives reassured the company’s U.S. brokers and advisers on Monday that the embattled Swiss banking giant has no plans to sell UBS Wealth Management Americas.  “Again: this business is not for sale,” UBS Chairman Kasper Villiger and interim CEO Sergio Ermotti wrote in an internal memo. Ermotti was installed as CEO over the weekend after the sudden departure of group chief executive Oswald Gruebel, a strong backer of the U.S. business.  Villiger and Ermotti also affirmed their support for the Wealth Management Americas CEO Robert McCann, a former Merrill Lynch executive hired two years ago to lead the U.S. unit’s turnaround.  “UBS is committed to further developing our franchise in this important wealth market under Bob’s leadership,” Villiger and Ermotti wrote. A successful U.S. wealth management business is “essential” to the bank’s strategy, they said.  Gruebel’s resignation after a $2.3 billion trading loss from an alleged rogue trader adds to a drumbeat of disturbing headlines over the past three years that has undermined confidence among U.S. clients and financial advisers, some advisers and headhunters said.  The rogue trading incident uncovered by the bank two weeks ago undermined two years of efforts by Gruebel, a former Credit Suisse executive, to staunch billions of dollars of trading losses that eroded confidence in the parent bank during the 2008 financial crisis.  In the U.S., the latest scandal is putting brokers once again on the defensive in fending off questions from wealthy clients. UBS employed almost 6,900 financial advisers at the end of the second quarter, less than half the total of industry leader Morgan Stanley (MS.N).  “A lot of the advisers have been telling us that this negative press was really hard to spin,” said Mindy Diamond, a headhunter at Diamond Consultants in Chester, New Jersey, who has hired brokers away from UBS. “There are a lot of very frustrated UBS advisers.”  Rick Peterson, a recruiter in Houston who seeks to hire out of UBS, said the sense of instability among the firm’s advisers is growing.  “Every time you hear, ‘UBS loses a pile of money’ or ‘UBS is in trouble with the U.S. government,’ it means UBS is in trouble with their clients,” he said.  The trading loss and Gruebel’s departure also has breathed new life into a long-standing rumor that UBS would divest or spin off its U.S. brokerage arm, which is not as profitable as the Swiss company’s private banking businesses.  McCann’s brokerage operation pays advisers a percentage of fees and commissions, which often results in higher payouts than the salaries and bonuses received by private bankers. A broker’s clients also can be more loyal to a broker than to the parent bank, while private banking has the reverse dynamic.  UBS earlier this year was rumored to be talking about selling the U.S. brokerage to Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) big U.S. bank that has been expanding its brokerage arm. A few years ago, HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBA.L) was the purported suitor.  Wells, HSBC and UBS declined at the times to comment on the speculation.  Before he joined the firm, McCann himself was part of a group that approached Gruebel to buy the U.S. operation, and rumors of a management buyout has resurfaced recently. UBS said the rumor was “categorically untrue.”  Research analyst Richard Bove of Rochdale Securities said UBS executives in Switzerland have good reason to hold onto the U.S. business as they struggle to build capital and restructure their investment bank.  “The U.S. brokerage is not capital intensive and it throws off cash,” Bove said.  UBS executives on Monday, nevertheless, took pains to combat rumors within the bank that with Gruebel gone the emphasis should turn to private banking.  Robert Mulholland, the No. 2 executive at UBS Wealth Management Americas, reinforced Villiger and Ermotti’s message in a conference call with regional and branch managers Monday morning.  “We are not for sale,” he said, according to a UBS employee who listened to the call. “It was the board’s decision not to sell, not just Ossie’s.”  The impact of Gruebel’s departure, he added, is “in a word, nothing.”  However, some advisers indicated that the latest scandal may be the last straw following a tax scandal in which UBS reached a $780 million settlement with the U.S. government over helping U.S. clients avoid paying almost $20 billion of taxes by setting up offshore accounts. The bank also agreed to turn over the name of 4,450 clients that U.S. officials suspect of tax evasion.  In the year before McCann arrived near the end of 2009, nearly a third of top advisers bolted and client assets plunged by about $119 billion. McCann had been reversing that trend prior to the latest trading scandal.  Now the tough conversations have returned.  “I had a client ask me, ‘How can I trust you to manage my money, if you can’t manage yours,” said a veteran UBS broker, who asked not to be named. “There’s a serious lack of confidence in the firm. There’s constant surprises.”  ",9262011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ubs-brokerage/ubss-new-ceo-commits-to-keeping-u-s-brokerage-idUSTRE78P4IA20110926

Lawrence Durso and Kris Frazier joined Morgan Stanley Barney’s office in Red Bank, New Jersey, and were registered at their new office since last Thursday. The two teamed for the past eight years with Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage arm of Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N).   Durso and Frazier together generated $2.2 million in revenue over the past year and managed $280 million in assets under management.   Durso has worked in the financial services industry for more than three decades, since starting at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc as an adviser in 1978. Between Merrill and Wells Fargo, he worked for 19 years at Prudential Securities Inc, a predecessor firm of Wells Fargo.   Frazier started with Prudential Securities in 2000.   Between the two, the team’s specialities will span retirement planning, tax management, estate planning services, education funding and risk management.   Durso and Frazier will report to Marlboro, New Jersey-based Branch Manager Chris Shaw.

226,WFC,"Hussey Copper seeks bankruptcy, plans sale","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hussey Copper Corp has filed for bankruptcy and plans to sell its assets, citing financial strain in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.  Leetsdale, Pennsylvania-based Hussey, a maker of copper bus bar and other copper products, entered a voluntary Chapter 11 petition on Tuesday in federal bankruptcy court, listing between $100 million and $500 million in assets and liabilities.  The company said it reached a baseline, or “stalking horse,” agreement to sell itself to KHC Acquisition LLC after efforts to refinance its debt failed. Hussey said it will engage in a “competitive bidding process” in which other suitors can outbid KHC.  In an affidavit filed with the petition, Chief Restructuring Officer Dalton Edgecomb said fluctuations in the price of copper have hurt Hussey, which lost $3 million in net income in 2010. Copper prices have fallen more than 20 percent this year as concerns about a possible global recession weighed on the economically sensitive metal.  Hussey said it owes about $38 million to first-lien lenders, including units of Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and PNC Bank. The company tried unsuccessfully to refinance its debt as part of a forbearance agreement after defaulting on the loans.  Hussey also owes $2.4 million to second lien lender Schneider Electric SA (SCHN.PA) and about $29 million in unsecured trade debts to various suppliers, it said.

227,WFC,"UPDATE 3-Hussey Copper seeks bankruptcy, plans sale"," * Lists between $100 mln and $500 mln in debts, assets   * Blames bankruptcy on fluctuation in copper prices   * Says plans to sell assets  (Adds information on Hussey’s debts; no-comment from company; details on sale plan)   By Nick Brown   NEW YORK, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Hussey Copper Corp has filed for bankruptcy and plans to sell its assets, citing financial strain in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.   Leetsdale, Pennsylvania-based Hussey, a maker of copper bus bar and other copper products, entered a voluntary Chapter 11  petition on Tuesday in federal bankruptcy court, listing between $100 million and $500 million in assets and liabilities.   The company said it reached a baseline, or “stalking horse,” agreement to sell itself to KHC Acquisition LLC after efforts to refinance its debt failed. Hussey said it will engage in a “competitive bidding process” in which other suitors can outbid KHC.   In an affidavit filed with the petition, Chief Restructuring Officer Dalton Edgecomb said fluctuations in the price of copper have hurt Hussey, which lost $3 million in net income in 2010. Copper prices have fallen more than 20 percent this year as concerns about a possible global recession weighed on the economically sensitive metal.   Hussey said it owes about $38 million to first-lien lenders, including units of Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and PNC Bank. The company tried unsuccessfully to refinance its debt as part of a forbearance agreement after defaulting on the loans.   Hussey also owes $2.4 million to second lien lender Schneider Electric SA (SCHN.PA) and about $29 million in unsecured trade debts to various suppliers, it said. Metal Management Pittsburgh Inc holds the largest unsecured claim at $9.05 million, court papers show.   A spokesman for the company did not return a call seeking comment.

230,WFC,UBS's new CEO commits to keeping U.S. brokerage,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - UBS AG’s UBSN.VXtop two executives reassured the company’s U.S. brokers and advisers on Monday that the embattled Swiss banking giant has no plans to sell UBS Wealth Management Americas.  “Again: this business is not for sale,” UBS Chairman Kasper Villiger and interim CEO Sergio Ermotti wrote in an internal memo. Ermotti was installed as CEO over the weekend after the sudden departure of group chief executive Oswald Gruebel, a strong backer of the U.S. business.  Villiger and Ermotti also affirmed their support for the Wealth Management Americas CEO Robert McCann, a former Merrill Lynch executive hired two years ago to lead the U.S. unit’s turnaround.  “UBS is committed to further developing our franchise in this important wealth market under Bob’s leadership,” Villiger and Ermotti wrote. A successful U.S. wealth management business is “essential” to the bank’s strategy, they said.  Gruebel’s resignation after a $2.3 billion trading loss from an alleged rogue trader adds to a drumbeat of disturbing headlines over the past three years that has undermined confidence among U.S. clients and financial advisers, some advisers and headhunters said.  The rogue trading incident uncovered by the bank two weeks ago undermined two years of efforts by Gruebel, a former Credit Suisse executive, to staunch billions of dollars of trading losses that eroded confidence in the parent bank during the 2008 financial crisis.  In the U.S., the latest scandal is putting brokers once again on the defensive in fending off questions from wealthy clients. UBS employed almost 6,900 financial advisers at the end of the second quarter, less than half the total of industry leader Morgan Stanley (MS.N).  “A lot of the advisers have been telling us that this negative press was really hard to spin,” said Mindy Diamond, a headhunter at Diamond Consultants in Chester, New Jersey, who has hired brokers away from UBS. “There are a lot of very frustrated UBS advisers.”  Rick Peterson, a recruiter in Houston who seeks to hire out of UBS, said the sense of instability among the firm’s advisers is growing.  “Every time you hear, ‘UBS loses a pile of money’ or ‘UBS is in trouble with the U.S. government,’ it means UBS is in trouble with their clients,” he said.  The trading loss and Gruebel’s departure also has breathed new life into a long-standing rumor that UBS would divest or spin off its U.S. brokerage arm, which is not as profitable as the Swiss company’s private banking businesses.  McCann’s brokerage operation pays advisers a percentage of fees and commissions, which often results in higher payouts than the salaries and bonuses received by private bankers. A broker’s clients also can be more loyal to a broker than to the parent bank, while private banking has the reverse dynamic.  UBS earlier this year was rumored to be talking about selling the U.S. brokerage to Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) big U.S. bank that has been expanding its brokerage arm. A few years ago, HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBA.L) was the purported suitor.  Wells, HSBC and UBS declined at the times to comment on the speculation.  Before he joined the firm, McCann himself was part of a group that approached Gruebel to buy the U.S. operation, and rumors of a management buyout has resurfaced recently. UBS said the rumor was “categorically untrue.”  Research analyst Richard Bove of Rochdale Securities said UBS executives in Switzerland have good reason to hold onto the U.S. business as they struggle to build capital and restructure their investment bank.  “The U.S. brokerage is not capital intensive and it throws off cash,” Bove said.  UBS executives on Monday, nevertheless, took pains to combat rumors within the bank that with Gruebel gone the emphasis should turn to private banking.  Robert Mulholland, the No. 2 executive at UBS Wealth Management Americas, reinforced Villiger and Ermotti’s message in a conference call with regional and branch managers Monday morning.  “We are not for sale,” he said, according to a UBS employee who listened to the call. “It was the board’s decision not to sell, not just Ossie’s.”  The impact of Gruebel’s departure, he added, is “in a word, nothing.”  However, some advisers indicated that the latest scandal may be the last straw following a tax scandal in which UBS reached a $780 million settlement with the U.S. government over helping U.S. clients avoid paying almost $20 billion of taxes by setting up offshore accounts. The bank also agreed to turn over the name of 4,450 clients that U.S. officials suspect of tax evasion.  In the year before McCann arrived near the end of 2009, nearly a third of top advisers bolted and client assets plunged by about $119 billion. McCann had been reversing that trend prior to the latest trading scandal.  Now the tough conversations have returned.  “I had a client ask me, ‘How can I trust you to manage my money, if you can’t manage yours,” said a veteran UBS broker, who asked not to be named. “There’s a serious lack of confidence in the firm. There’s constant surprises.”  ",9272011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ubs-brokerage/ubss-new-ceo-commits-to-keeping-u-s-brokerage-idUSTRE78Q1DV20110927

234,WFC,U.S. banks woo California in mortgage settlement," * Banks met with California AG last week   * California seen as critical to deal; NY already exited   * Banks, states have not talked specific penalty amounts   By Aruna Viswanatha   WASHINGTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. banks, eager to get legal protection after widespread evidence emerged of foreclosure shortcuts, are trying to convince California to be part of a multi-state mortgage settlement and not pursue its own aggressive deal.   Representatives of the banks met with California’s attorney general, Kamala Harris, in Washington last Friday, in part to discuss concerns unique to California and determine whether the state is on board with a larger deal, according to people familiar with the talks.   The banks see California, with its massive distressed mortgage market, as critical to a wider settlement, especially after New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman last month was removed from a small panel of AGs negotiating a deal.   The leader of the state coalition said Schneiderman had “actively worked to undermine” the talks, after Schneiderman balked at releasing the banks from claims beyond the mortgage servicing and foreclosure problems that sparked the negotiations.   Now California is in the spotlight as settlement talks drag into a second year and the prospects for a deal appear increasingly in doubt.   State and federal officials have sought penalties totaling roughly $20 billion from institutions that include Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N), and Citigroup (C.N).   They are accused of coping with an unexpected deluge of mortgage defaults beginning in 2008 by cutting corners and unlawfully rushing through foreclosure paperwork, pushing people out of homes they might otherwise have stayed in.   Banks would prefer a broad settlement that would maximize  their legal immunity, provide more certainty about their financial liability, and help soothe skittish holders of bank shares.   A settlement could also boost home sales by removing the current uncertainty over the status of foreclosed homes.   “A settlement would expedite the cleansing process of the marketplace,” said Marty Mosby, an analyst with Guggenheim Partners. “For Bank of America, this would be a real launching pad for them to get something behind them.”   A settlement without New York and California would leave too much of the country uncovered, Mosby said.   California has faced some of the worst default rates in the country, with an unemployment rate of 12.1 percent and two million residents who owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth, often referred to as underwater mortgages.   Harris is under pressure to provide relief to the state’s homeowners and also faces political heat from activist groups like MoveOn.org and Credo Action to stake out a hard-line position similar to New York.   A spokesman for Harris declined to comment.   Government officials had hoped to wrap up negotiations months ago, but talks have stalled over what legal claims the states would then give up.   Banks pushed to include a release from conduct in underwriting the mortgages and securitizing them — claims that the critic states have said lay at the heart of the financial crisis and have not yet been investigated.   The servicing and foreclosure claims that started the talks will be addressed by any settlement, but all other issues remain up in the air, people familiar with the talks said.   Other claims could include how banks underwrote certain loans, and some narrow issues associated with the electronic registry banks used to track the ownership of mortgages, MERS, these people said.   Specific numbers on fines are not yet part of the discussion, they said. Exactly how the money would be divided and spent also remains a thorny issue.   The bulk of the penalties, some 70 or 80 percent, would likely go to a federal pot. The banks would be expected to use that money to help ease problems for distressed borrowers, including writing down principal amounts on underwater mortgages, and providing cash assistance to move to rental units.   The rest of the money is likely to be divided among the states to provide relief to homeowners as they see fit.   Any settlement has to also contend with parallel actions, including those from bank regulators including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.   The agency in April directed more than a dozen banks to review in detail foreclosure files from 2009 and 2010 and compensate any harmed borrowers, a process that recently got off the ground.   Whether the states can come to an agreement, or the talks might split off into smaller deals, remains an open question.   “It should be becoming increasingly apparent that a global, multi-defendant, 50-state, plus Justice Department settlement is not feasible,” said Andrew Sandler, a financial services attorney not involved in the talks.   Representatives from the banks declined to comment.

235,WFC,Bank of America to charge debit card use fee,"(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp plans to charge customers who use their debit cards to make purchases a $5 monthly fee beginning early next year, joining other banks scrambling for new sources of revenue.  U.S. banks have been looking for ways to increase revenue as regulations introduced since the financial crisis limited the use of overdraft and other fees.  The Dodd-Frank Act’s Durbin amendment, due to go into effect on October 1, caps fees banks can charge merchants for processing debit card transactions at 21 cents per transaction from an average of 44 cents, potentially costing banks billions of dollars.  Banks also face broader operational challenges as low interest rates and higher capital requirements hit profitability, and the sluggish economy depresses loan demand.  Other large U.S. banks including Wells Fargo & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co and SunTrust Banks Inc are testing or planning monthly debit card fees.  “The economics of offering a debit card have changed,” Bank of America spokeswoman Anne Pace said on Thursday. Bank of America is the largest U.S. bank by assets.  Senator Richard Durbin, architect of debit card interchange fee reform, bashed the proposed monthly fee. “Bank of America is trying to find new ways to pad their profits by sticking it to its customers,” he said in a statement. It’s overt, unfair, and I hope their customers have the final say.”  Even before introduction of the Durbin amendment’s rules on debit fees, Bank of America’s fee income was dropping at its deposits and card services units. The bank’s deposits unit reported fee income of $1 billion in the second quarter of 2011, down 34 percent from $1.5 billion a year before.  Card services, which includes the bank’s credit and debit card operations, reported fee income of $1.9 billion, down 23 percent from $2.5 billion in second quarter 2010.  “This might be a fee too far,” said Ed Mierzwinski, director of the consumer program for the U.S. PIRG, a federation of state public interest research groups.  Mierzwinski said such fees could push customers to smaller banks that have not introduced checking and debit-related fees.  Pace said customers expect certain features for their accounts, like overdraft and fraud protection, and the fee would offset some of those costs.  The fee will be waived for the bank’s premium or platinum privileges accounts tied to its Merrill Lynch brokerage. It will also not be charged for using the card to access the bank’s ATMs, Pace said.  She declined to say how much the bank expects to earn through these fees or how many customers would be affected.  Some banks have pushed back against debit fees.  Citigroup Inc said earlier this month that it would not impose debit card usage fees as part of a broader account restructuring.  The head of banking products for Citi’s U.S. consumer bank said customers had told the bank that a debit card fee would be “a huge source of irritation.”  ",9292011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bankofamerica-debit/bank-of-america-to-charge-debit-card-use-fee-idUSTRE78S4GQ20110929

237,WFC,California exits mortgage settlement talks,"(Reuters) - The state of California pulled out of multi-state mortgage negotiations with large U.S. banks, dealing a sharp blow to long-running efforts to secure a broad settlement over allegations of lending abuses.  California Attorney General Kamala Harris told fellow government officials running the talks that the deal under discussion failed to provide enough relief for her state’s homeowners and released the banks from too many claims.  The full impact of her decision, announced in a letter on Friday, is unclear, but a person close to the negotiations said the loss of California would not derail the talks. The banks and the rest of the negotiating team will meet in Washington D.C. next week as scheduled, this person said.  Banks are seeking legal immunity beyond the accusations of wrongful foreclosures and mortgage servicing errors to include errors in originating home loans and packaging them for investors, sources familiar with the talks have said.  The banks have been negotiating for months with the states and the federal departments of Justice, and Housing and Urban Development. The financial firms would prefer that as many states as possible sign on to any agreement, particularly states with large numbers of foreclosures, such as California.  “California was being asked for a broader release of claims than we can accept and... the relief contemplated would allow too few California homeowners to stay in their homes,” Harris said in her letter.  New York had left the talks in August over a disagreement about how much legal immunity the banks should receive in any settlement.  A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said discussions are ongoing, and federal officials “continue to work” with states, including California.  State and federal officials have discussed penalties totaling roughly $20 billion from institutions that include Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup.  The banks are accused of dealing with the deluge of mortgage defaults that began in 2008 by cutting legal corners and unlawfully rushing through foreclosure paperwork, pushing people out of homes they might otherwise have stayed in.  Representatives of the banks met with Harris last week in an attempt to keep California on board.  The state has faced some of the worst default rates in the country, with an unemployment rate of 12.1 percent and two million residents who owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth.  Eight of the 10 hardest hit U.S. cities in terms of foreclosure rates are in California, Harris said.  Jason Ware, equity analyst at Salt Lake City-based Albion Financial Group, said California’s decision adds to uncertainty about the banks’ ultimate liability for the mortgage mess.  “I’d rather just see one big battle they’d have to fight than all these smaller skirmishes. It’s a difficult stock group to own right now, because of all the uncertainties.”  Evidence of the foreclosure shortcuts burst into public view about a year ago.

238,WFC,UPDATE 2-California exits U.S. mortgage settlement talks," * States, DOJ probing banks over foreclosure shortcuts   * Calif AG: national talks had too little homeowner relief   * Talks to continue with meeting next week - source  (Adds comments from Justice Dept, NY attorney general spokesman)   By Aruna Viswanatha   Sept 30 (Reuters) - The state of California pulled out of multi-state mortgage negotiations with large U.S. banks, dealing a sharp blow to long-running efforts to secure a broad settlement over allegations of lending abuses.    California Attorney General Kamala Harris told fellow government officials running the talks that the deal under discussion failed to provide enough relief for her state’s homeowners and released the banks from too many claims.   The full impact of her decision, announced in a letter on Friday, is unclear, but a person close to the negotiations said the loss of California would not derail the talks. The banks and the rest of the negotiating team will meet in Washington D.C. next week as scheduled, this person said.   Banks are seeking legal immunity beyond the accusations of wrongful foreclosures and mortgage servicing errors to include errors in originating home loans and packaging them for investors, sources familiar with the talks have said.   The banks have been negotiating for months with the states and the federal departments of Justice, and Housing and Urban Development. The financial firms would prefer that as many states as possible sign on to any agreement, particularly states with large numbers of foreclosures, such as California.   “California was being asked for a broader release of claims than we can accept and... the relief contemplated would allow too few California homeowners to stay in their homes,” Harris said in her letter.   New York had left the talks in August over a disagreement about how much legal immunity the banks should receive in any settlement. [ID:nN1E77O1AJ]   A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said discussions are ongoing, and federal officials “continue to work” with states, including California.   State and federal officials have discussed penalties totaling roughly $20 billion from institutions that include Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N), and Citigroup (C.N).   The banks are accused of dealing with the deluge of mortgage defaults that began in 2008 by cutting legal corners and unlawfully rushing through foreclosure paperwork, pushing people out of homes they might otherwise have stayed in.   Representatives of the banks met with Harris last week in an attempt to keep California on board.   The state has faced some of the worst default rates in the country, with an unemployment rate of 12.1 percent and two million residents who owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth.   Eight of the 10 hardest hit U.S. cities in terms of foreclosure rates are in California, Harris said.   Jason Ware, equity analyst at Salt Lake City-based Albion Financial Group, said California’s decision adds to uncertainty about the banks’ ultimate liability for the mortgage mess.   “I’d rather just see one big battle they’d have to fight than all these smaller skirmishes. It’s a difficult stock group to own right now, because of all the uncertainties.”   Evidence of the foreclosure shortcuts burst into public view about a year ago. Bank stocks, as measured by the KBW banks index .BKX, have declined roughly 30 percent so far this year.

240,WFC,Analysis: Brokers miffed as banks seek cross sales,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Banks keen to grow revenue want their brokerage arms to pitch more loans and credit cards to clients, a plan resented by financial advisers.  Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co, which are among several banks that also own brokerages, have promoted “cross-selling” bank products to advisory clients as a key strategy for plumping up profits. Wells Fargo brokers, for example, are encouraged to promote retirement services, mortgages and other accounts.  The strategy, however, continues to meet resistance.  Many advisers say there is little financial incentive for them to hawk bank products, while some worry the practice could hurt their relationship with clients.  “A financial adviser at an investment firm doesn’t want to be told what to do. Period,” said Timothy White, a recruiter at Kaye/Bassman International in Dallas. “Advisers also understand the client doesn’t want to be sold anything.”  Cross-selling initiatives, though hardly new, gained some attention in early September when BofA dismissed wealth management boss Sallie Krawcheck and placed Merrill’s 16,000 brokers under the watch of a career commercial banker.  The shake-up was partly driven by Krawcheck’s resistance to more aggressive cross-selling efforts, brokers said. Her departure fueled worries that without her advocacy, BofA would turn financial advisers into a sales arm for the bank.  Banks are being squeezed by a sluggish economy and post-crisis regulation to rein in lucrative sources of fee income. Financial houses could lose $12 billion next year just from caps on debit-card and overdraft fees, according to Javelin Strategy and Research.  In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, commercial banks consolidated their control of the brokerage industry. Many advisers, especially those whose careers were built at independent firms like Merrill Lynch or A.G. Edwards & Sons, still bristle at the idea of working for a big bank.  Thousands of brokers avoid the problem altogether, by fleeing in recent years to become registered investment advisers (RIAs) or to join smaller, regional firms that are independent of banks.  Indeed, some advisers say even if cross selling is more financially lucrative, it isn’t worth it because of the risk of alienating clients. Steering an investor to the mortgage department, or to open a credit card account, can backfire if that customer has a poor experience.  Referrals to a bank’s lenders might be rejected, too.  “You don’t want to lose a relationship. The bank might screw it up,” said New York recruiter Michael Kelly, citing broker clients he says are strongly opposed to cross-selling. “I’m not sure it’s a good thing to introduce clients around.”  Several current and former Merrill advisers also contend there’s little need to sell BofA’s products. Merrill pioneered a cash management account with checking in 1977 and has long offered charge cards, debit cards and portfolio-backed loans.  “What does BofA have to offer our clients? Financing and checking,” said Brian Amidei, a Palm Desert, Calif., adviser who led two partners and five other team members away from Merrill to join start-up brokerage HighTower Advisors in May. “We already had checking accounts.”  Merrill spokeswoman Selena Morris said the firm’s advisors get no financial incentive to make referrals or sell loans and banking accounts. Sales are driven instead by client needs, she said, which can then boost satisfaction.  Wells Fargo Advisors spokesman Tony Mattera said the third-largest U.S. brokerage does not set sales goals or mandates, but that advisers are compensated for referrals. Offering loans, trust services and deposit accounts can strengthen client relationships, he said.  Bank executives say internal referrals can also benefit advisers as wealthy corporate and investment bank clients can also be steered toward brokers.  Some industry watchers believe banks might get better results with stronger incentives for advisers.  “Banks need to put together a compensation plan that rewards bank advisors and promotes the achievements of advisors who leverage internal partners,” Aite Group senior analyst Sophie Schmitt said. A recent Aite survey of brokers found that more than one-third of respondents did not generate any revenue from internal referrals.  To be sure, not all advisers are opposed to cross-selling, and many believe that marrying wealth management with banking services is attractive to investors and financially rewarding for their own practices.  A valued customer may call from a car dealership seeking a better auto loan rate, while another calling from the airport may need to transfer money between accounts, said Nadia Allaudin, a Merrill broker in Los Angeles for 12 years.  “I’ve never been asked to sell something at this firm. All the opportunities I’m seeing within my practice come from clients asking, ‘Can you do this for me?’”  Ultimately, brokers insist their intent is to preserve business relationships built over years and even decades.  “The relationship is not based on the bull logo; it’s based on the adviser,” said Robert Black, a former broker at Merrill, Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette and Alex Brown & Sons who last year launched Baltimore wealth management boutique, Harbor Investment Advisory.  “If you don’t feel right about a product,” Black said, “you shouldn’t be forced to sell it.”  ",9302011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brokerages-crossselling/analysis-brokers-miffed-as-banks-seek-cross-sales-idUSTRE78T2HO20110930
241,WFC,RPT-U.S. banks woo California in mortgage settlement," (Repeats Sept. 29 item to additional subscribers)   * Banks met with California AG last week   * California seen as critical to deal; NY already exited   * Banks, states have not talked specific penalty amounts   By Aruna Viswanatha   WASHINGTON, Sept 29 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. banks, eager to get legal protection after widespread evidence emerged of foreclosure shortcuts, are trying to convince California to be part of a multi-state mortgage settlement and not pursue its own aggressive deal.   Representatives of the banks met with California’s attorney general, Kamala Harris, in Washington last Friday, in part to discuss concerns unique to California and determine whether the state is on board with a larger deal, according to people familiar with the talks.   The banks see California, with its massive distressed mortgage market, as critical to a wider settlement, especially after New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman last month was removed from a small panel of AGs negotiating a deal.   The leader of the state coalition said Schneiderman had “actively worked to undermine” the talks, after Schneiderman balked at releasing the banks from claims beyond the mortgage servicing and foreclosure problems that sparked the negotiations.   Now California is in the spotlight as settlement talks drag into a second year and the prospects for a deal appear increasingly in doubt.   State and federal officials have sought penalties totaling roughly $20 billion from institutions that include Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N), and Citigroup (C.N).   They are accused of coping with an unexpected deluge of mortgage defaults beginning in 2008 by cutting corners and unlawfully rushing through foreclosure paperwork, pushing people out of homes they might otherwise have stayed in.   Banks would prefer a broad settlement that would maximize  their legal immunity, provide more certainty about their financial liability, and help soothe skittish holders of bank shares.   A settlement could also boost home sales by removing the current uncertainty over the status of foreclosed homes.   “A settlement would expedite the cleansing process of the marketplace,” said Marty Mosby, an analyst with Guggenheim Partners. “For Bank of America, this would be a real launching pad for them to get something behind them.”   A settlement without New York and California would leave too much of the country uncovered, Mosby said.   California has faced some of the worst default rates in the country, with an unemployment rate of 12.1 percent and two million residents who owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth, often referred to as underwater mortgages.   Harris is under pressure to provide relief to the state’s homeowners and also faces political heat from activist groups like MoveOn.org and Credo Action to stake out a hard-line position similar to New York.   A spokesman for Harris declined to comment.   Government officials had hoped to wrap up negotiations months ago, but talks have stalled over what legal claims the states would then give up.   Banks pushed to include a release from conduct in underwriting the mortgages and securitizing them — claims that the critic states have said lay at the heart of the financial crisis and have not yet been investigated.   The servicing and foreclosure claims that started the talks will be addressed by any settlement, but all other issues remain up in the air, people familiar with the talks said.   Other claims could include how banks underwrote certain loans, and some narrow issues associated with the electronic registry banks used to track the ownership of mortgages, MERS, these people said.   Specific numbers on fines are not yet part of the discussion, they said. Exactly how the money would be divided and spent also remains a thorny issue.   The bulk of the penalties, some 70 or 80 percent, would likely go to a federal pot. The banks would be expected to use that money to help ease problems for distressed borrowers, including writing down principal amounts on underwater mortgages, and providing cash assistance to move to rental units.   The rest of the money is likely to be divided among the states to provide relief to homeowners as they see fit.   Any settlement has to also contend with parallel actions, including those from bank regulators including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.   The agency in April directed more than a dozen banks to review in detail foreclosure files from 2009 and 2010 and compensate any harmed borrowers, a process that recently got off the ground.   Whether the states can come to an agreement, or the talks might split off into smaller deals, remains an open question.   “It should be becoming increasingly apparent that a global, multi-defendant, 50-state, plus Justice Department settlement is not feasible,” said Andrew Sandler, a financial services attorney not involved in the talks.   Representatives from the banks declined to comment.

242,WFC,Bank of America to charge debit card use fee,"CHARLOTTE (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp plans to charge customers who use their debit cards to make purchases a $5 monthly fee beginning early next year, joining other banks scrambling for new sources of revenue.  U.S. banks have been looking for ways to increase revenue as regulations introduced since the financial crisis limited the use of overdraft and other fees.  The Dodd-Frank Act’s Durbin amendment, due to go into effect on October 1, caps fees banks can charge merchants for processing debit card transactions at 21 cents per transaction from an average of 44 cents, potentially costing banks billions of dollars.  Banks also face broader operational challenges as low interest rates and higher capital requirements hit profitability, and the sluggish economy depresses loan demand.  Other large U.S. banks including Wells Fargo & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co and SunTrust Banks Inc are testing or planning monthly debit card fees.  “The economics of offering a debit card have changed,” Bank of America spokeswoman Anne Pace said on Thursday. Bank of America is the largest U.S. bank by assets.  Senator Richard Durbin, architect of debit card interchange fee reform, bashed the proposed monthly fee. “Bank of America is trying to find new ways to pad their profits by sticking it to its customers,” he said in a statement. It’s overt, unfair, and I hope their customers have the final say.”  Even before introduction of the Durbin amendment’s rules on debit fees, Bank of America’s fee income was dropping at its deposits and card services units. The bank’s deposits unit reported fee income of $1 billion in the second quarter of 2011, down 34 percent from $1.5 billion a year before.  Card services, which includes the bank’s credit and debit card operations, reported fee income of $1.9 billion, down 23 percent from $2.5 billion in second quarter 2010.  “This might be a fee too far,” said Ed Mierzwinski, director of the consumer program for the U.S. PIRG, a federation of state public interest research groups.  Mierzwinski said such fees could push customers to smaller banks that have not introduced checking and debit-related fees.  Pace said customers expect certain features for their accounts, like overdraft and fraud protection, and the fee would offset some of those costs.  The fee will be waived for the bank’s premium or platinum privileges accounts tied to its Merrill Lynch brokerage. It will also not be charged for using the card to access the bank’s ATMs, Pace said.  She declined to say how much the bank expects to earn through these fees or how many customers would be affected.  Some banks have pushed back against debit fees.  Citigroup Inc said earlier this month that it would not impose debit card usage fees as part of a broader account restructuring.  The head of banking products for Citi’s U.S. consumer bank said customers had told the bank that a debit card fee would be “a huge source of irritation.”  ",9302011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bankofamerica-debit/bank-of-america-to-charge-debit-card-use-fee-idUSTRE78S4GQ20110930
243,WFC,Fast TARP exit meant less capital for some banks: U.S. audit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some large U.S. banks would have stronger capital bases to better deal with today’s market stresses had regulators not relaxed bailout repayment criteria in late 2009, a new government audit showed on Friday.  Bank of America (BAC.N) Citigroup (C.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and PNC Financial (PNC.N) were allowed exit the Troubled Asset Relief Program without raising as much equity capital as initially prescribed by the Federal Reserve, the TARP Special Inspector General said in the report.  Following bank stress tests earlier in 2009, the Fed gave several banks guidance that they must raise $1 in common equity for every $2 in TARP bailout funds repaid — a formula meant to enable them to withstand future stresses.  But this standard — which was never previously made public — was quickly relaxed, allowing Bank of America, Citi and Wells Fargo to repay taxpayers nearly simultaneously in December 2009, raising a combined $49.1 billion in equity capital.  Enforcement of the $1 in equity for every $2 repaid guidance would have required $57.5 billion in equity capital to be raised by the three institutions. PNC was later allowed to exit TARP under similar relaxed guidance.  “It’s certainly a missed opportunity to get these banks out of TARP with not only more capital but higher quality capital, which could have had long-lasting consequences in strengthening their capital base,” TARP acting special inspector general Christy Romero told Reuters.  She said regulators “bowed” to pressure from the banks, who were keen to escape executive compensation restrictions associated with the bailout funds. But there was also pressure from the Treasury to allow them to exit TARP more quickly and repay taxpayers, she said.  U.S. bank shares, particularly those of Bank of America, have been hit by funding concerns amid market turmoil this month and Moody’s Investors Service last week cut credit ratings for B of A, Citi and Wells Fargo.  The SIGTARP report does not specifically address the current market concerns, but Romero said the original Fed exit guidance was aimed at providing ample and high-quality capital to absorb potential losses and demonstrate the banks’ viability to investors.  “What you see today is the banks selling off assets. While that may raise capital, it’s a one-time hit, and also you’ve just lost potential sources of revenue generation,” Romero said.  The report quotes U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner as saying that Treasury pursued a “forceful strategy of raising capital early” to pressure on banks to sell shares sooner rather than later. “We thought the American economy would be in a better position if <the firms> went out and raised capital,” the report quoted him as saying.  Geithner often cites the U.S. bank stress tests and bank capital raisings of 2009 as a major source of strength for the U.S. financial system and is now pressing European policymakers to ensure their banks have adequate capital to withstand sovereign debt problems.  Tim Massad, Treasury assistant secretary for financial stability, said taxpayers stand to earn more than $20 billion from bailout investments in U.S. banks.  “Treasury wanted the major banks to raise private capital and repay taxpayers because that was necessary to restore stability and strength to the financial system,” he said.

245,WFC,Banks could face new source of mortgage losses,"(Reuters) - A federal housing insurance program may be forced to deny bank claims for money lost in home loan foreclosures, costing them another $13.5 billion in mortgage-related losses, according to a report on Monday from bank analyst Paul Miller of FBR Capital Markets.  Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo, three of the four largest U.S. banks, are at risk for the biggest losses, the analyst estimated.  The Federal Housing Authority, which insures about 10 percent of all mortgage debt outstanding, faces financial and political pressure to deny claims that in the past it paid almost automatically, Miller wrote in the report.  FHA claims could be “the next shoe to drop,” on banks and the mortgage market after, he said. The banks have already been hit by claims from government-run mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as from private investors, for selling them bad mortgage loans and related securities.  Banks servicing mortgage loans could be hit with as much as $13.5 billion in losses under a scenario in which the agency contends the banks made mistakes in those processes, Miller wrote. Or, the FHA may deny claims based on mistakes in lending, in which case the losses could reach $11.5 billion. Miller pegged possible losses at about $3 billion for Wells Fargo, $2 billion for Bank of America and $1 billion for JPMorgan.  It could take time for either scenario to unfold, he said. “Until there is more widespread evidence of FHA claim denials, we believe that the risk is more of a headline risk than a capital concern,” Miller wrote.  Battles with the FHA over losses could prompt banks to further tighten lending standards and “ultimately result in another leg down in housing prices as borrowers find it harder to access credit,” Miller said.  While the FHA has taken steps to strengthen its finances, it could come under mounting pressure from rising mortgage defaults to limit its payouts.  The FHA may also seek punitive damages from the banks by alleging they made false claims for reimbursement of losses on foreclosed properties, Miller said.

247,WFC,Republican drops opposition to US banking nominee," * Corker says OCC nominee has answered his concerns   * Unclear when Senate may vote on the nomination   By Dave Clarke   WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A key U.S. senator said on Tuesday that he no longer has concerns about President Barack Obama’s nominee to lead the agency overseeing national banks, and that he would not block a vote on the nomination.   Last month, Senator Bob Corker said he was concerned Thomas Curry would not be independent enough of the Obama administration to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is an independent bank regulator.   In an interview on Tuesday, Corker, a Republican and member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he has since met with Curry and that he no longer has those fears.   “As far as I’m concerned it is fine to bring his nomination up,” he said. “We have no problems with him, he knows that. It was just a situation of sitting down. You want the OCC to be totally independent of the Treasury.”   The OCC regulates national banks like JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N).   Curry’s ability to soothe Corker’s concerns removes a big impediment to a vote on his nomination.   It remains unclear, however, when a vote will be held and a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid did not immediately return a request for comment.   Republicans could still block a vote on Curry as part of broader objections to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law or over other policy disagreements.   Corker said, however, he is not aware of any opposition to Curry.   Curry was nominated for the job in June and the Senate Banking Committee voted to approve his nomination on Sept. 8. At that meeting, Corker voiced his concerns about Curry’s “strength” and independence.   The two subsequently met on Sept. 14 to further discuss the nomination.   “I assure you that if confirmed as the Comptroller of the Currency, I will zealously preserve the independence of the OCC from all undue external influences,” Curry wrote to Corker in a Sept. 22 letter.   Curry is one of several nominees to head agencies playing important roles under the Dodd-Frank law whose nominations are still pending in the Senate.   The Banking Committee also voted on Sept. 8 to send to the Senate floor the nomination of Martin Gruenberg to head the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.   Senator Richard Shelby, the leading Republican on the Banking Committee, has said he supports Gruenberg’s nomination.   Republicans are unlikely to allow a vote on Gruenberg until President Obama names nominees to fill two other empty spots on the FDIC board.   On Thursday, the Banking Committee will vote on the nomination of Richard Cordray to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new agency that oversees products like credit cards and mortgages.

248,WFC,Final Wachovia branches set to disappear soon," * Wells Fargo to rebrand branches by mid-October   * Wells took over Wachovia in Oct 2008   By Rick Rothacker   CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct 4 (Reuters) - Three years after selling itself to Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Wachovia is finally disappearing.   Over the weekend, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo & Co. plastered its brand on the flagship bank branch in Wachovia’s former Charlotte headquarters complex.   Two prominent ATMs on Tryon Street, the main drag in the nation’s No. 2 banking center by assets, also got a makeover.   The bank is holding a ceremony on Oct. 13 to replace the final Wachovia sign. The final switches to Wells Fargo computer systems and full Wells branding will be on Oct. 15.   Wachovia had been in North Carolina since 1879.   Since buying Wachovia in 2008 at the peak of the financial crisis, Wells has been gradually converting the bank’s 3,000 or so branches state by state across the country.   Wachovia suffered a run on the bank in September 2008 as it groaned under the weight of bad residential and commercial mortgages. It sold itself to Wells Fargo in October 2008 under pressure from regulators including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

249,WFC,Massachusetts preparing to file foreclosure lawsuits,"(Reuters) - Massachusetts on Wednesday said it is preparing to sue big banks related to unlawful foreclosures, dealing another blow to the multi-state talks aimed at resolving those investigations on a national scale.  “I have lost confidence that the banks will bring to the table an agreement that properly holds them accountable for wrongful foreclosures,” Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley said in a statement.  Federal and state officials met with representatives of several large U.S. banks this week with hopes of reaching a deal in the coming weeks.  “After concluding two full days of negotiations here is D.C., we continue to have confidence” in reaching a settlement, Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who is leading the states’ effort, said in a statement.  Mortgage servicing units of Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N), Citigroup (C.N), and Ally Financial are accused of coping with an unexpected deluge of mortgage defaults beginning in 2008 by cutting corners and unlawfully rushing through foreclosure paperwork.  A settlement with all 50 states and federal authorities could help the banks move beyond the legal fallout that has dogged them since the peak of the financial crisis.  But the long-running talks — which will hit the one-year mark later this month — have been plagued from the start with criticism from states concerned about the extent of the legal immunity the banks have sought.  Last Friday, California pulled itself from the negotiating team and said the deal under discussion would not provide enough relief to the state’s homeowners.  Though Massachusetts is not part of the team negotiating the larger settlement, Coakley has in the past expressed reservations about the direction of the talks.  In July, her office said it was investigating unlawful foreclosures, and examining whether creditors failed to establish whether they had the right to foreclose on a home before doing so, or whether they filed false or misleading documents in connection with a foreclosure.  Her office was examining whether the electronic registry used to track the ownership of mortgages during the height of the housing boom, MERS, conformed to state law.  On Wednesday, Coakley said her office is “aggressively proceeding” with those efforts and is prepared to file lawsuits soon.  “We have begun preparing for litigation,” Coakley said.  People close to the multi-state talks have told Reuters a settlement is possible without all states signing on.  Even if a state isn’t a signatory to a final deal, its residents could benefit.  The bulk of any settlement — some 70 to 80 percent — is expected to settle federal claims, and that pot is expected to be used by banks to provide relief to struggling homeowners across the country.  “While attorneys general are free to criticize an agreement that does not yet exist, we expect that they’ll soon see the tangible results of our yearlong efforts,” Iowa attorney general Miller said.

252,WFC,"U.S. wins three tax cases involving big banks, KPMG","(Reuters) - United States prosecutors said on Tuesday they had won three major cases against American clients of questionable tax shelters including ones used by a Dallas billionaire and Wells Fargo Co. (WFC.N) and others designed by Citibank (C.N) and accounting firm KPMG LLP.  The separate cases, the verdicts of which were rendered last Friday, represent a significant victory for the US Justice Department, which was sued by each of the three clients when the Internal Revenue Service denied as improper their claimed deductions that totaled hundreds of millions of dollars.  The rulings also underscore how the two agencies, in the midst of a crackdown on offshore tax evasion by wealthy Americans at Swiss banks, are continuing to pursue corporate tax shelters used by large American companies.  In the first case, the Fifth Circuit appeals court in New Orleans upheld a lower court ruling that D. Andrew Beal, a Dallas, Texas billionaire banker, improperly used a sham shelter to deduct $200 million in federal income taxes stemming from more than $1 billion on sham losses.  A Justice Department statement said the shelter involved Beal acquiring “a portfolio of non-performing Chinese debt for less than $20 million, disposing of the portfolio and generating more than $1 billion in artificial paper losses approximately equivalent to the debt’s face value.”  Beal is the founder of Beal Bank, a small bank headquartered in Dallas and is No.39 on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans with a $7 billion personal fortune.  In the second case, a federal judge in Iowa ruled that Principal Life Insurance Co., part of Principal Financial Group PFG.N in Iowa, a large investment company, could not claim $21 million in foreign tax credits stemming from a $300 million transaction with Bred Banque Populaire and Natexis Banque Populaire, two French banks, from 2000 through 2005.  The judge found that the transaction lacked both economic substance and a business purpose - two key features of questionable tax shelters - and was a loan rather than an investment. The transaction, the judge ruled, was designed solely to generate foreign tax credits and thus violated anti-abuse regulations at the Treasury Department.  The complex transaction involved a Delaware company called Pritired 1 LLC, in which Principal Financial and Citicorp North America, a division of Citigroup, were the sole investors. Pritired, the tax matters partner in the lawsuit, sued the US government - meaning, in this case, the IRS - in 2008 after the agency disallowed its refund claims.  Court papers said that Bruno Rovani and John Buckens, both employees of a London-based division of Citi’s Structured Products Group, Citi Capital Structuring Group, designed and carried out the transactions underpinning the shelter.  Principal Financial Group, a member of the Fortune 500 largest American companies, manages nearly $336 billion in assets, mainly retirement plans and investment funds. It manages 10 of the 25 largest pension plans in the world, according to its website.  In his decision, Judge John Jarvey wrote that “the facts of this case are exceedingly complex. American companies sent $300 million to French banks who combined the $300 million with $900 million of their own. The money was used to earn income from low-risk financial instruments. French income taxes were paid on the income from this approximately $1.2 billion investment.”  The judge also said “the American companies received some cash from the income on the securities, but, more importantly, were given the ability to claim foreign tax credits on the taxes paid on the entire $1.2 billion pool. Through this transaction, the French banks were able to borrow $300 million at below market rates. The American companies received a very high return on an almost risk-free investment.”  In the third decision, a federal judge in Minnesota disallowed a claim by a Wells Fargo subsidiary for more than $82 million in tax refunds.  The claim stemmed from a sham transaction in 1999, improperly valued at nearly $424 million, that involved capital losses stemming from Wells Fargo’s transfer of “underwater” commercial leases to a subsidiary in conjunction with a related sale of stock to Lehman Brothers, the defunct investment bank. Wells Fargo had tried to claim the tax refunds on its 1996 corporate tax return.  Court papers show that Wells Fargo bought the shelter from the accounting firm KPMG LLP for $3 million in 1998, part of what court papers said KPMG characterized a “quick hit” tax strategy on the eve of Old Wells Fargo’s merger that year with Norwest. Wells Fargo sued the US in 2007 when the IRS denied its refund claims.  Joel Resnick, a former KPMG partner, offered testimony in the case about KPMG having sold Wells Fargo a “tax product” called an “economic liability transaction,” according to court papers.  “KPMG employees developing the economic liability transaction product knew that a company needed a non-tax business purpose to justify the transaction,” wrote Judge John Tunheim, of Minneapolis, in his decision.  KPMG narrowly averted an indictment in 2005 over its sale of questionable tax shelters to wealthy Americans. It paid a $456 million fine and was put on probation through a deferred-prosecution agreement that has now expired.

254,WFC,"Wall St gurus reach the limit, scale back on stocks","* Firms shift to underweight equities in past weeks * Some investment gurus predicting recession * Biggest shift for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney since 2009 By Jessica Toonkel Oct 11 (Reuters) - Clients of some big Wall Street firms have probably missed out on sharp increases in stocks over the last few days. Firms that were cautiously optimistic or bullish through the summer selloff have turned bearish just as the market seems to be clawing back. Between Sept. 18 and Oct. 6, several Wall Street firms who mostly stood pat through months of market volatility finally decided enough is enough. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, Wells Fargo Advisors and UBS have scaled back their portfolios’ exposure to equities in the past three-and-a-half weeks, shifting away from more unpredictable stocks and into the safety of fixed income and cash. Meanwhile, the S&P; 500 Index had its biggest rally in nearly six weeks on Monday. But that hasn’t swayed investment officers at the firms. They don’t believe governments in Europe and the U.S. are doing enough to address the crushing debt threatening their financial systems. Investment managers said they believe the ongoing uncertainty and wild market swings caused by the expanding euro zone debt crisis and a U.S. debt downgrade are here to stay. What’s more, the volatility suggests to some investment gurus that another recession is increasingly likely. European leaders have been meeting for months to address the debt crisis plaguing the continent. What little progress there has been is not happening fast enough, said Jeff Applegate, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the brokerage arm of Morgan Stanley . European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet warned on Tuesday that the crisis had “reached a systemic dimension.” At the same time, in the U.S. the government has been unable to get much accomplished, Applegate said. For example, it’s been weeks since President Obama submitted his fiscal stimulus package, and there hasn’t been any action in Congress. “You have seen a lot of change since August,” Applegate said. “And the policy responses have not been been swift enough or large enough.” On Oct. 6, MSSB shifted the allocation of its portfolios from overweight on global equities, commodities and REITs to underweight and from underweight on global cash to overweight. The firm also shifted its allocation on global bonds from underweight to overweight. “This is a big shift for us, the biggest we have made since April 2009,” Applegate said. At that time MSSB shifted to overweight equities as the markets rebounded after the financial crisis. One major factor in MSSB’s decision to cut back on risk was a Sept. 21 report by the Economic Cycle Research Institute predicting a recession. ECRI has successfully predicted the last four U.S. recessions. On Oct. 1, Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage arm of Wells Fargo & Co. went from neutral to underweight on its equity exposure in its cyclical asset allocation portfolios. Wells, which reevaluates its portfolios on a quarterly basis, first reduced its equity exposure slightly in April, but cut exposure even further this month due to fears about the European debt crisis, said Stuart Freeman, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors. The firm in April shifted its moderate growth & income portfolio to 58 percent in equities from 63 percent. This month, the fund decreased its share of equities again, to 45 percent. Wells Fargo Advisors now predicts a 35 percent chance for a U.S. recession, up from a 20 percent chance four months ago, Freeman said. The chances of a recession in Europe, according to the firm: 40 percent, up from 25 percent a few months ago. Similarly, UBS shifted its portfolios from neutral to underweight equities on Sept. 18. “We felt that the fundamental issues affecting the markets had not been resolved,” said Mike Ryan, head of research for wealth management at UBS. Ryan doesn’t think the United States is necessarily headed for a recession. “We think you will see choppy, sluggish growth,” he said. Of course, not every firm is scaling back on equities. Equity strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch — whose well-known logo is a bull — are maintaining their overweight position on equities, albeit a “moderate” overweight position, said Kate Moore, global equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. She said that too many investors have held too small a position in equities since the market crash of 2008 and missed the rally. She believes Europe is closer to coming up with a solution for its problems. “We are seeing a willingness of policy makers in Europe to put things together,” she said. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s economists forecast U.S. GDP growth of 2.5 percent for the third quarter, she said. “That’s a far cry from the two quarters of negative GDP growth that define a recession,” Moore said.

255,WFC,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo gives staff tough healthcare choices,"* Staff to use account-based plans for healthcare * A choice between higher premiums or higher deductible * Banks face cost pressure; healthcare is prime for cuts By Rick Rothacker Oct 12 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co , one of the largest U.S. employers, plans to cut costs by moving its workers into insurance plans that encourage them to spend less on healthcare. The bank told Reuters that it is rolling out a new insurance approach next year that will give employees accounts to help cover medical expenses. They can either put their own pretax dollars in the accounts, or pay higher insurance premiums and have the company fund the account. If employees opt to put their own money into the accounts, they are on the hook for more of their medical expenses if they get sick. If they stay healthy, they benefit from lower premiums. These types of accounts are believed to be useful in encouraging consumers to think more about how they are spending healthcare dollars. For most employers, these accounts are one option among many for health insurance, said Alexander Domaszewicz, a principal with human resources consulting firm Mercer. Only a handful of other companies, including General Electric Co and JPMorgan Chase & Co , are going the same route as Wells Fargo and offering only account-based healthcare plans. “It still isn’t common for very large firms,” Domaszewicz said in an interview this week. But other companies may follow suit. Account-based health plans can cut employees’ and companies’ premium costs by 15 percent, according to Mercer. Other employers often follow big companies like Wells Fargo when it comes to benefits, Domaszewicz said. In materials sent to employees recently, Wells said it was making the change “because rising health care costs and the impact of federal health care reform require us to take a new approach to managing costs together.” Studies are mixed over whether the new U.S. healthcare law will drive up employers’ healthcare costs, but overall U.S. health insurance premiums have surged over the last decade. A study last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the average annual premium for family coverage through an employer increased 9 percent to $15,073 in 2011 from the year before. Since 2000, premiums have risen 134 percent. Employers pay nearly three-quarters of that premium, a rate that has held fairly steady for the last 10 years, according to the foundation’s data. “This is one of the fastest-growing expenses employers have,” said Randall Abbott, a senior consultant at healthcare consulting firm Towers Watson. Cost-cutting is particularly crucial in the financial sector, where the mortgage crisis, low long-term interest rates, and weak loan demand are depressing revenue. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo is looking to shave $1.5 billion from its quarterly operating expenses by the end of 2012 under a program known as “Project Compass.” Wells earned $7.3 billion for common stockholders in the first half of the year, up from $5.3 billion in the first half of last year. A Mercer survey found that health benefits costs on average will rise 5.4 percent in 2012, the smallest increase since 1997, because employers have been so aggressive about cutting these expenses. “We view this as effective use of healthcare services, not as cost-cutting measures,” bank spokesman Ancel Martinez said on Wednesday. U.S. employers began widely offering healthcare coverage after World War Two to get around government salary controls. With 275,000 full- and part-time employees, Wells Fargo is the 12th-largest employer among public companies, according to Fortune Magazine. About one-third of the bank’s employees already use some sort of account-based plan. Wells will still offer traditional plans in California and other states where switching would force too many employees to change their doctors. Under the bank’s program, employees can have a “health reimbursement account,” which Wells funds, or a “health savings account,” which workers fill with their own pretax dollars. Both accounts will help cover out-of-pocket expenses until a deductible is met. After that, Wells will cover between 80 and 90 percent of medical expenses, with the employee picking up the rest. After an employee reaches an out-of-pocket maximum, Wells covers 100 percent of additional expenses. An insurance company administers the claims. Eligible preventive care, such as routine checkups, annual screenings and immunizations, is covered 100 percent. Employees can earn money to put into their accounts through participating in health and wellness programs. A Wells employee in North Carolina covered on an individual basis would pay a premium of about $23 per two-week pay period for the health savings account option, compared with $48 for the health reimbursement account plan. An employee in an individual plan can put up to $3,100 into a health savings account under IRS rules next year. The deductible in that plan is $3,000. In the health reimbursement option, the company can put between $200 and $1,000 in an employee’s account. The deductible is $2,000 for individual coverage. Employees must pay $25 for a primary office visit, which is less than the full cost. There are also co-pays for generic prescription drugs. Employees who use health savings accounts can roll their money into the next year if they do not use it all and take it with them if they leave the company.",10122011,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-health/update-1-wells-fargo-gives-staff-tough-healthcare-choices-idUSN1E79B1LK20111012
256,WFC,Eleven arrested in San Francisco protest,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Police arrested 11 demonstrators for blocking access to Wells Fargo’s corporate headquarters in San Francisco on Wednesday, and the city’s famed cable cars were halted for two hours during protests against economic inequality, officials said. The 11 arrested at Wells Fargo were issued citations for trespassing after occupying an entrance to the building, prompting bank officials to briefly shut down the office tower, San Francisco police officer Albie Esparza said. A separate Wells Fargo bank branch around the corner was closed for the day due to the protests, Esparza said. “Our role here was to allow and facilitate First Amendment rights and make sure peace was maintained. And it was a peaceful protest,” Esparza said. The gathering was part of a growing number of rallies that have sprung up from Wall Street demonstrations that began last month, protesting against unemployment woes, disparities in wealth and government bailouts of major banks. Earlier in the day, a rally by anti-Wall Street protesters prompted the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency to halt service on its famed cable car lines for nearly two hours, transit spokesman Paul Rose told Reuters. “From what we could gather, we don’t think they were trying to block service,” he said. “They had just gathered in that area, and we held service until they cleared.” No arrests were reported. Roughly 100 to 200 protesters marched to the Wells Fargo site from the U.S. Federal Reserve building, according to Pete Woiwode, 28, a protest organizer who spoke with Reuters by cell phone from the scene. “Wells Fargo is a good target because they have been very involved in the foreclosure crisis, kicking people out of their homes,” Woiwode said. “Our message is: Stop kicking people out of their homes, start paying your taxes.” Police escorted Wells Fargo employees in and out of the headquarters through a secure entryway after first closing access to the entire building for about 15 minutes, company spokesman Ruben Pulido said. “Wells Fargo recognizes that Americans are demanding more from their financial institutions during these difficult economic times,” Wells Fargo said in a written statement. “In addition to repaying the U.S. government $25 billion for the TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) funds in December 2009, Wells Fargo paid an additional $1.4 billion in dividends to the U.S. Treasury as well; that was a strong return on investment for the government.” By midday, the protest had dispersed from the area.

The 11 arrested at Wells Fargo were issued citations for trespassing after occupying an entrance to the building, prompting bank officials to briefly shut down the office tower, San Francisco police officer Albie Esparza said. A separate Wells Fargo bank branch around the corner was closed for the day due to the protests, Esparza said. “Our role here was to allow and facilitate First Amendment rights and make sure peace was maintained.

259,WFC,Wells Fargo gives staff tough choices for healthcare,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, one of the largest U.S. employers, plans to cut costs by moving its workers into insurance plans that encourage them to spend less on healthcare. The bank confirmed to Reuters that it’s rolling out a new insurance plan next year that will give employees accounts to help cover medical expenses. They can either put their own pretax dollars in the accounts, or pay higher insurance premiums and have the company fund the account. If employees opt to put their own money into the accounts, they are on the hook for more of their medical expenses if they get sick. If they stay healthy, they benefit from lower premiums. Across the United States, companies are pressing their staff to open these types of accounts because they force consumers to think more about how they are spending healthcare dollars. But for most employers, these accounts are one option among many for health insurance, said Alexander Domaszewicz, a principal with human resources consulting firm Mercer. Only a handful of other companies, including General Electric Co and JPMorgan Chase & Co, are going the same route as Wells Fargo and offering only account-based healthcare plans. “It still isn’t common for very large firms,” Domaszewicz said. But other companies may follow suit because account-based health plans can cut employees’ and companies’ premium costs by 15 percent. Other employers often follow big companies like Wells Fargo when it comes to benefits, Domaszewicz said. In materials sent to employees, Wells said it was making the change “because rising health care costs and the impact of federal health care reform require us to take a new approach to managing costs together.” Studies are mixed over whether the new U.S. healthcare law will drive up employers’ healthcare costs, but overall U.S. health insurance premiums have surged over the last decade. A study last month by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the average annual premium for family coverage through an employer increased 9 percent to $15,073 in 2011 from the year before. Since 2000, premiums have risen 134 percent. Employers pay nearly three-quarters of that premium, a rate that has held fairly steady for the last 10 years, according to the foundation’s data. “This is one of the fastest-growing expenses employers have,” said Randall Abbott, a senior consultant at healthcare consulting firm Towers Watson. Cost-cutting is particularly crucial in the financial sector, where the mortgage crisis, low long-term interest rates, and weak loan demand are depressing revenue. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo is looking to shave $1.5 billion from its quarterly operating expenses by the end of 2012 under a program known as “Project Compass.” A Mercer survey found that health benefits costs on average will rise 5.4 percent in 2012, the smallest increase since 1997, because employers have been so aggressive about cutting these expenses. U.S. employers began widely offering healthcare coverage after World War Two to get around government salary controls. With unemployment now at 9.1 percent, however, companies don’t need to work as hard to keep workers happy. With 275,000 full- and part-time employees, Wells Fargo is the 12th-largest employer among public companies, according to Fortune Magazine. About one-third of the bank’s employees already use some sort of account-based plan. Wells will still offer traditional plans in California and other states where switching would force too many employees to change their doctors. Under the bank’s program, employees can have a “health reimbursement account,” which Wells funds, or a “health savings account,” which workers fill with their own pretax dollars. Both accounts will help cover out-of-pocket expenses until a deductible is met. After that, Wells will first share medical costs with the employee and later assume all of them after they reach a certain point. Eligible preventive care, such as routine checkups, annual screenings and immunizations, is covered 100 percent. Employees can earn money to put into their accounts through participating in health and wellness programs. A Wells employee in North Carolina covered on an individual basis would pay about $23 per two-week pay period for the health savings account option, compared with $48 for the health reimbursement account plan. An employee in an individual plan can put up to $3,100 into a health savings account under IRS rules next year. The deductible in that plan is $3,000. In the health reimbursement option, the company can put between $200 and $1,000 in an employee’s account. The deductible is $2,000 for individual coverage. Employees must pay $25 for a primary office visit, which is less than the full cost.

262,WFC,RPT-UPDATE 1-Wall St went bearish...just before stocks rebound,"* Firms shift to underweight equities in past few weeks * Some investment gurus predicting recession * Biggest shift for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney since 2009 By Jessica Toonkel Oct 11 (Reuters) - Clients of some big Wall Street firms have probably missed out on a sharp recovery in stocks over the past few days. The firms, who were cautiously optimistic or bullish through the summer selloff, have turned bearish just as the market seems to be clawing back. Between Sept. 18 and Oct. 6, several Wall Street houses who mostly stood pat through months of market volatility and heavy declines finally decided enough is enough. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, Wells Fargo Advisors and UBS have scaled back their portfolios’ exposure to equities in the past three-and-a-half weeks, shifting away from stocks and into fixed income and cash. Meanwhile, the S&P; 500 Index had its biggest rally in nearly six weeks on Monday and has gained 8.8 percent in the past six trading days. Despite that, investment officers at the firms say they don’t don’t believe governments in Europe and the U.S. are doing enough to address the crushing debt undermining their financial systems. Investment managers said they believe the ongoing uncertainty and wild market swings are here to stay. What’s more, the volatility suggests to some investment strategists that another recession is increasingly likely. European leaders have been meeting for months to address the debt crisis plaguing the continent. What little progress there has been is not happening fast enough, said Jeff Applegate, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the brokerage arm of Morgan Stanley . European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet warned on Tuesday that the crisis had “reached a systemic dimension.” At the same time, in the U.S. the government has been unable to get much accomplished, Applegate said. For example, President Obama’s jobs-creation package was defeated in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday. “You have seen a lot of change since August,” Applegate said. “And the policy responses have not been been swift enough or large enough.” On Oct. 6, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney shifted the allocation of its portfolios from overweight on global equities, commodities and real estate investment trusts to underweight, while going overweight from underweight on cash and global bonds. “This is a big shift for us, the biggest we have made since April 2009,” Applegate said. At that time the firm shifted to overweight equities as the markets rebounded after the financial crisis. One major factor in Morgan Stanley Smith barney’s decision to cut back on risk was a Sept. 21 report by the Economic Cycle Research Institute predicting a recession. ECRI has successfully predicted the past four U.S. recessions. On Oct. 1, Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage arm of Wells Fargo & Co. went from neutral to underweight on its equity exposure in its cyclical asset allocation portfolios. Wells, which reevaluates its portfolios on a quarterly basis, first reduced its equity exposure slightly in April, but cut exposure even further this month due to fears about the European debt crisis, said Stuart Freeman, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors. The firm in April shifted its moderate growth & income portfolio to 58 percent in equities from 63 percent. This month, the fund decreased its share of equities again, to 45 percent. Wells Fargo Advisors now predicts a 35 percent chance for a U.S. recession, up from a 20 percent chance four months ago, Freeman said. The chances of a recession in Europe, according to the firm: 40 percent, up from 25 percent a few months ago. Similarly, UBS shifted its portfolios from neutral to underweight equities on Sept. 18. “We felt that the fundamental issues affecting the markets had not been resolved,” said Mike Ryan, head of research for wealth management at UBS. Ryan doesn’t think the United States is necessarily headed for a recession. “We think you will see choppy, sluggish growth,” he said. Of course, not every firm is scaling back on equities. Equity strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch - whose logo is a bull — are maintaining their overweight position on equities, albeit a “moderate” overweight position, said Kate Moore, global equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. She said that too many investors have held too small a position in equities since the market crash of 2008 and missed the rally. Furthermore, she said she believes Europe is closer to coming up with a solution for its problems. “We are seeing a willingness of policy makers in Europe to put things together,” she said. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s economists forecast U.S. GDP growth of 2.5 percent for the third quarter, she said. “That’s a far cry from the two quarters of negative GDP growth that define a recession,” Moore said.

263,WFC,UPDATE 1-Democrats ask US Justice Dept to probe bank fees,"* Democrats want probe of whether banks coordinated fees * BofA, Wells, JPMorgan have announced fee rises * Other lawmakers seeking repeal of Durbin amendment By Alexandra Alper WASHINGTON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - House Democrats on Thursday called on the Justice Department to investigate whether large banks are coordinating new fees in violation of antitrust laws. Representative Peter Welch said public statements by big banks and trade groups raise questions about whether financial firms have colluded on fee increases to make up for revenues lost because of a new cap on debit card swipe fees. The letter is the latest battle over the Durbin amendment, which went into effect on Oct. 1 and cut by nearly half the amount banks can charge merchants when customers swipe their debit cards. The amendment has been a boon to retailers and an aggravation for the banks who stand to lose billions of dollars in annual revenues. Bank of America Corp , Wells Fargo & Co and JPMorgan Chase & Co recently announced they are testing or planning new monthly debit card fees. Welch and other Democrats sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder that outlined examples of the American Bankers Association, the Independent Community Bankers Association and other trade groups saying new fees are inevitable. “We are concerned that communications between banks and bank associations that may amount to price signaling or collusion have occurred in the wake of Congressional action to reform debit card swipe fees,” the letter said. Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said the agency received the letter and will respond as appropriate. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America declined to comment. A Wells Fargo representative was adamant the company’s fee decisions were independent. “We are trying to cover the cost of providing debit card services,” said Lisa Westermann, a spokeswoman for the bank. Bank of America’s new fees on debit card use begin early next year, while JPMorgan Chase’s pilot is already in effect. Wells Fargo’s pilot begins on Friday. Senator Dick Durbin and other Democrats who supported the swipe fee limits have been quick to slam the banks for introducing new charges. But the financial industry has said lawmakers were aware the fee limits were a gift to retailers and potentially harmful to consumers. “It’s ironic that Congressman Welch and some members of Congress continue to feign surprise and outrage at the consequences of an amendment that they themselves advocated at the behest of giant retail,” said Trish Wexler, spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments Coalition, which is made up of banks and credit card companies. MF Global policy analyst Jaret Seiberg expressed skepticism about the charges, drawing a distinction between collusion, which is illegal, and successive fee changes by companies — a practice he says is common. “It seems highly unlikely that bankers would (collude) when they know the political spotlight is shining all over this issue,” he said. The pressure from Democrats comes as other House lawmakers try to repeal the Durbin amendment. Republican Jason Chaffetz and Democrat Bill Owens introduced legislation on Wednesday to repeal the swipe fee rule, calling it a form of price control that harms both consumers and the banking industry. “These legislatively enacted price controls have compelled banks to charge consumers higher (and in some cases new) fees to make up for lost revenue,” Chaffetz said in a statement. Some market watchers see the issue as a distraction. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Gardner had clear instructions for investors contemplating the ongoing battle to repeal the Durbin amendment or scrutinize banks further. “Ignore the noise,” he said in a note.",10132011,http://www.reuters.com/article/financial-regulation-fees/update-1-democrats-ask-us-justice-dept-to-probe-bank-fees-idUSN1E79C1UH20111013

265,WFC,Eleven arrested in San Francisco protest,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Police arrested 11 demonstrators for blocking access to Wells Fargo’s corporate headquarters in San Francisco on Wednesday, and the city’s famed cable cars were halted for two hours during protests against economic inequality, officials said. The 11 arrested at Wells Fargo were issued citations for trespassing after occupying an entrance to the building, prompting bank officials to briefly shut down the office tower, San Francisco police officer Albie Esparza said. A separate Wells Fargo bank branch around the corner was closed for the day due to the protests, Esparza said. “Our role here was to allow and facilitate First Amendment rights and make sure peace was maintained. And it was a peaceful protest,” Esparza said. The gathering was part of a growing number of rallies that have sprung up from Wall Street demonstrations that began last month, protesting against unemployment woes, disparities in wealth and government bailouts of major banks. Earlier in the day, a rally by anti-Wall Street protesters prompted the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency to halt service on its famed cable car lines for nearly two hours, transit spokesman Paul Rose told Reuters. “From what we could gather, we don’t think they were trying to block service,” he said. “They had just gathered in that area, and we held service until they cleared.” No arrests were reported. Roughly 100 to 200 protesters marched to the Wells Fargo site from the U.S. Federal Reserve building, according to Pete Woiwode, 28, a protest organizer who spoke with Reuters by cell phone from the scene. “Wells Fargo is a good target because they have been very involved in the foreclosure crisis, kicking people out of their homes,” Woiwode said. “Our message is: Stop kicking people out of their homes, start paying your taxes.” Police escorted Wells Fargo employees in and out of the headquarters through a secure entryway after first closing access to the entire building for about 15 minutes, company spokesman Ruben Pulido said. “Wells Fargo recognizes that Americans are demanding more from their financial institutions during these difficult economic times,” Wells Fargo said in a written statement. “In addition to repaying the U.S. government $25 billion for the TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) funds in December 2009, Wells Fargo paid an additional $1.4 billion in dividends to the U.S. Treasury as well; that was a strong return on investment for the government.” By midday, the protest had dispersed from the area.

266,WFC,UPDATE 5-Wells Fargo loses luster with profit miss,"* Lending margins shrink and bank misses estimates * Usually resilient shares plunge more than 8 percent * Q3 EPS 72 cents vs Wall Street view 73 cents * Net interest income declines 5 pct from year earlier * CEO: “we get” anger over jobs, economy By Rick Rothacker and David Henry Oct 17 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co posted lower net interest income as the weak U.S. economy squeezed its lending margins, sending the bank’s shares tumbling more than 8 percent. The report from the fourth-biggest U.S. bank exacerbated investor concerns that low interest rates and weak demand for loans from cautious businesses and consumers will hurt bank profits for a lot longer than they had expected. The bank’s shares fell 8.4 percent to close at $24.42 Monday, their biggest one-day percentage plunge on an earnings report in at least a decade. Shares of the three larger U.S. banks, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup fell too, but all less than three percent. Citigroup posted higher earnings on Monday mainly because of an accounting adjustment. Wells Fargo executives said lending margins were down in large part because businesses and individuals made bank deposits faster than the bank could invest those savings in higher-paying loans. Another drag came from customers paying off higher-rate loans the bank had made in the past. “Right off the bat, net interest margin declined more than expected,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Joe Morford. Wells Fargo said net interest income, a key measure of lending profit, fell 5 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier. Fee income from making home loans and providing other services fell 7 percent over the same period. Pressure on lending margins has increased since Aug. 9, when the Federal Reserve said it would intervene in the financial markets to pull down long-term rates. As deposits have increased, the bank has had to buy securities, whose interest yield has been declining, with the money. As a result, Wells Fargo’s net margin, which is the difference between what it pays for money and how much it gets for investing it, tumbled to 3.84 percent from 4.25 percent a year earlier. The lending spread was also lower than the second-quarter’s 4.01 percent. Chief Executive John Stumpf called the interest rate environment “unusual.” He said the bank is working to strengthen its relationships with customers in anticipation of a time when they will want to borrow more. “The economic recovery has been more sluggish and uneven than anyone anticipated,” Stumpf said. Because the bank set aside less money to cover loan losses during the quarter — $1.81 billion down from $3.44 billion a year earlier — Wells Fargo’s net income for common shareholders rose to $3.84 billion, or 72 cents a share, from $3.15 billion, or 60 cents a share a year ago. Profit at Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. home loan servicer, was a penny short of the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wells Fargo’s report comes as the industry struggles to hold onto recent profits after having lost tens of billions of dollars in the financial crisis. Financial company earnings in the third quarter are expected to be up only a fraction of a percent from a year earlier, and still less than half as much as they were five years ago, according to Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research. Wells Fargo’s loan portfolio was up 1.1 percent to $760 billion, with commercial loans up 3 percent in the quarter. The loan growth was partly from higher demand and partly a matter of taking business from competitors, Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said in an interview. He said the economy is growing, but “choppy.” Analysts said Wells Fargo’s report showed that banks generally are still benefiting from fewer delinquencies, though the pace of improvement is slowing as bad loans are removed from their books. Wells Fargo said its earnings were boosted by releasing reserves of $800 million for bad loans, down from $1 billion in each of the first two quarters of this year. Such releases amount to dipping into money previously set aside to cover bad loans and have been a significant part of bank earnings over the past year as lenders decided they set aside too much. Wells executives told analysts in a conference call after the report to expect more reserve releases as long as the economy does not turn down sharply. Analysts and investors have tended to expect more recently from Wells Fargo than from its bigger competitors because its shares are less subject to the ups and downs of the financial markets.  Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup, in contrast, earn more of their income from underwriting stocks and bonds and providing corporate takeover advice. The bank said it began “streamlining” staff functions and consolidating consumer lending businesses and several technology groups during the quarter. Noninterest expenses fell 5 percent from a year ago to $11.7 billion on lower personnel, merger and litigation costs. Under a program announced earlier, the bank wants to lower quarterly noninterest expenses to $11 billion by the end of 2012. Stumpf, asked in a conference call with analysts about the Occupy Wall Street protests, said, “I understand some of the angst and anger. This downturn has been too long. “Unemployment is too high, and people are hurting. We get that,” Stumpf said. He said he is more interested in making more loans to promote local economies than he is in an advertising program to improve the reputation of the financial industry.",10172011,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo/update-5-wells-fargo-loses-luster-with-profit-miss-idUSN1E79C1Y120111017

268,WFC,US STOCKS-Wall Street lower as Germany dampens optimism,"* No euro debt solution at Oct summit—German finmin * Citi up as profit rises, Wells Fargo down after results * Indexes off: Dow 1.1 pct, S&P; 1.1 pct, Nasdaq 1.1 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks fell more than 1 percent on Monday as Germany’s finance minister dampened expectations an upcoming summit would produce a breakthrough in Europe’s debt crisis. Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said a European Union meeting on Oct. 23 would adopt a platform to address the region’s financial turmoil, but “we won’t have a definitive solution this weekend,” he added. His statement short-circuited a stocks rally that had been fueled by optimism about progress in solving the euro zone crisis. Schaeuble’s comments also sent the euro lower against the dollar and pressured shares of financials. The KBW bank index lost 2.2 percent. Also weighing on the sector were disappointing earnings from Wells Fargo & Co , which fell 6.1 percent to $25.04. “What we are looking at today in the market is obviously a direct correlation to what is going on in Europe,” said Chris Hobart, chief executive of Hobart Financial Group in Charlotte, North Carolina. “Everything seems to be going well with Europe for a while, and you get this little news and it reconfirms the fears that everybody has.” The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 131.01 points, or 1.13 percent, to 11,513.48. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 13.29 points, or 1.09 percent, to 1,211.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 29.42 points, or 1.10 percent, to 2,638.43. The S&P; 500 had risen more than 8 percent for the first back-to-back winning weeks since July and the best two-week run since 2009. The index approached the top of a two-month trading range on hopes the global economy can sidestep a new recession and the euro zone will resolve its sovereign debt crisis and recapitalize its banks. “The past couple of weeks have been obviously a phenomenal little run-up. The problem is it’s a delicate run-up,” said Hobart. Events in Europe overshadowed a $21 billion deal by Kinder Morgan Inc to buy rival El Paso Corp , combining the two largest natural gas pipeline operators in North America in a huge bet on the fast-growing market for that fuel. El Paso’s shares surged 23.7 percent to $24.23 and Kinder Morgan shares jumped 8.5 percent to $29.17. Corporate earnings began to pick up steam. Wells Fargo missed Wall Street earnings estimates by 1 cent a share as interest income was weaker than expected. But Citigroup Inc rose 1 percent to $28.76 after it reported higher third-quarter earnings as the bank set aside less money to cover bad loans and recorded an accounting gain banks can take in turbulent markets.",10172011,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-stocks/us-stocks-wall-street-lower-as-germany-dampens-optimism-idUSN1E79G0TF20111017

We know that the underlying business models of these companies are strong the underlying businesses are performing well despite headwinds.” On Wells Fargo: “Wells Fargo missed by a penny so that’s a little disappointing. One reason we’re a big fan of Wells Fargo is there’s less volatility in the earnings. This number is a slight disappointment especially when you look at what Citi has done to beat on earnings and revenues.” On big banks in general: “The money center banks are an interesting investment these days. It’s just extremely cheap on a price to book, price to tangible, price to earnings or discounted cash flows, the valuations are extremely attractive. The underlying business is performing extremely well, their capital bases are very strong. The biggest concern we have at Capital Advisors Growth Fund is disorderly unwind in the Euro zone and the market’s reaction to it.” ",10172011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-results/instant-view-citigroup-wells-fargo-post-results-idUSTRE79G2H120111017

274,WFC,Top banks accused of colluding on ATM fees,"(Reuters) - A New Jersey man sued Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo on Wednesday on behalf of ATM users, accusing the banks of colluding to fix the fees they charge customers to withdraw money. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., is the third such suit seeking class action status on the issue of automated teller machine fees in the past week. The latest suit alleges the banks worked with Visa and MasterCard to set artificially high rates on ATM fees. The earlier lawsuits were filed against Visa and MasterCard, Wednesday’s lawsuit is directed at both the card network firms and the banks. Customers who use ATMs not operated by their bank are often charged both by the operating bank and by their own bank, as a “foreign ATM transaction” fee. Successful ATM operators need access to the Visa and MasterCard networks, since the vast majority of debit cards are exclusive to them. Some cards can access alternate, cheaper networks. The lawsuits accuse Visa and MasterCard of forcing ATM operators to charge the same access fee to customers regardless of which network they use, in order to get access to the Visa and MasterCard networks. One of the other lawsuits was filed by a group representing the operators of ATMs. Wednesday’s lawsuit accused the banks, that collect the access fees, of colluding with Visa and MasterCard in setting the transaction price. A spokesman for JPMorgan declined comment. Representatives for Bank of America and Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case is Justin Genese v Visa, MasterCard and others, U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, No. 11-01838.

275,WFC,Durbin questions Wells Fargo's debit card fee,"* Letter follows record profit report this week * Wells is testing a $3/month fee. * Sen. Durbin is author of provision crimping debit fees By Rick Rothacker Oct 19 (Reuters) -  U.S. Sen. Richard Durbin is taking on another big bank, questioning why Wells Fargo & Co is testing a new debit card fee in five states while making record profits. The Illinois Democrat sent a letter to Wells CEO John Stumpf on Wednesday asking him to explain the fee, which charges customers $3 per month for using their debit cards. Durbin sent a letter to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan earlier this month asking him to justify a planned $5 monthly fee announced last month. Bank of America has faced the biggest backlash over its charge, although Wells Fargo disclosed its test program more than a month earlier. Both banks have said customers can avoid the fees by meeting hurdles like using direct deposit for their paychecks, or keeping a high enough minimum balance. “If you were hoping that your new fee would go unnoticed, it has not,” Durbin wrote Stumpf. Durbin is the author of a provision in the financial reform law passed last year that slashed the fees banks can charge merchants when customers pay with their debit cards. Starting in October, the Federal Reserve capped the fee at 21 cents per transaction, down from an average of about 44 cents per transaction. Banks have reacted by developing new charges for consumers for using their cards. The senator’s letter comes two days after San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said it earned $3.8 billion for common shareholders in the third quarter, up from $3.1 billion in the same quarter last year. In a conference call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan reiterated the bank’s estimate that the new law will cost the bank $250 million per quarter after taxes, but the bank expects to recover half of that over time with increased volume and “product changes.” Sloan told Reuters on Monday that the bank was still in the first stages of testing the fee and had not decided to expand or contract the program.",10192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-durbin/durbin-questions-wells-fargos-debit-card-fee-idUSN1E79I1G520111019

277,WFC,HOW TO PLAY IT: Banking on financial stocks,"ISSUE: While third-quarter earnings reports present a mixed picture for financial services companies, big declines in bank stocks offer tempting bargains for investors. By Joseph A. Giannone NEW YORK, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Are banks beyond repair? The largest U.S. financial companies did little to answer that question, delivering a mixed bag of quarterly results. Earnings rose at Bank of America , Morgan Stanley , Citigroup and Wells Fargo . Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase & Co and BlackRock Inc said profit fell, while Goldman Sachs Group had a rare loss. But they all have one thing in common: Severely depressed share prices, which means rarely seen bargains for the brave. For investors who remain worried about the banks — and there is plenty to be worried about — analysts say there is opportunity in sector funds and in other corners of the financial services sector. Bank stocks are decidedly out of fashion. The KBW Banks Index plunged 85 percent between its February 2007 peak and the depths of the financial crisis. After falling 28 percent this year, the index trades at about 1.3 times tangible book value, versus a long-term average of 3 times book value. For the brave, it means shares are available at rarely-seen valuations, said Gary Townsend, a former federal bank examiner and Friedman Billings Ramsey analyst who manages $40 million at Hill-Townsend Capital in Chevy Chase, Maryland. “We think we’ve seen the bottom. We can’t expect them to get much cheaper,” he said. It could be a while before the banks and their stocks are safely out of the woods, so near-term gains could be small. There are signs that bargain hunters have begun wading in, pushing the BKX up 6 percent from its two-and-a-half-year low, reached on Oct. 3. Citi shares are up 27 percent in that period. Some investors say third-quarter results offer some positive signs. Many banks beat profit expectations. Earnings on average are up 15 percent over the same period last year, and balance sheets are much improved since the financial crisis. Lending activity is also rising. “The outlook for the financial sector is steadily improving; it is not deteriorating despite understandable fears from all corners of the globe,” said Robert Albertson, chief strategist at Sandler O’Neill. Several investors and analysts said JPMorgan, US Bancorp , and Wells Fargo are well-positioned to benefit from a recovery in the sector thanks to their scale and healthier balance sheets. Others said investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman, having just endured the toughest markets in years, are poised to thrive when financial markets rebound because they are stronger, leaner and have fewer competitors. With continued uncertainty — from new regulation to Greek debt — investing in dozens of banks through exchange-traded funds could trim risk for investors who believe financials are over-sold and are willing to wait. Top rated bank ETFs include the $4.3 billion Financial Select Sector SPDR , the $317 million iShares Dow Jones U.S. Financial Services Sector ETFS and the $500 million Vanguard Financials ETFS But do some legwork before buying. Investors have to dig in to see how these index funds are constructed, S&P; Capital IQ analyst Todd Rosenbluth said. For example, the SPDR bank fund concentrates more than half of its assets in 10 companies, while iShares invests 38 percent in its top 10. That means the SPDR fund’s performance is closely tied to that of JPMorgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Investors in this case, wouldn’t get the benefit of holding smaller banks, which don’t have exposure to the world’s sovereign debt woes and have performed better in some cases. Investors can get exposure to smaller banks through the First Trust Nasdaq ABA Community Bank ETF , which has 61 names, the largest of which represents 5 percent of the fund. Big bank margins have been squeezed by near-zero interest rates and low long-term yields and Dodd-Frank reforms target risky but lucrative businesses bank businesses, like proprietary trading. That’s turned some investors off to big banks altogether. But there are other ways to invest in the sector and take advantage of the sell-off. Jeff Bronchick, founder of Cove Street Capital, a El Segundo, California firm managing $350 million, described himself as a value investor, someone who normally would eagerly scoop up beaten-down stocks. The economic and regulatory challenges facing banks, he said, are too daunting. “It’s better to avoid the dragon than slay the dragon,” he said. Bronchick owns Jefferies Group Inc , among the few brokers that did not become a bank during the crisis and small Ohio bank First Financial Bancorp Anton Schutz, Mendon Capital Advisors founder and manager of the $39 million Burnham Financial Services Fund , suggests a portfolio of small banks yielding 5 percent, such as New York Community Bancorp , Valley National Bancorp , First Niagara Financial Group . Asset management giant BlackRock Inc is another financial services-related option. The firm’s stock has lost 21 percent of its value this year, but its business would thrive if asset prices rebound. “You can take advantage of this beat-down,” Schutz said.

280,WFC,ON THE MOVE: Raymond James hires former Wells Fargo adviser,"Oct 25 (Reuters) - Raymond James & Associates has hired a veteran Wells Fargo adviser to join its employee broker-dealer team in Ohio, the firm said on Tuesday. Michael Short, a 12-year industry veteran, has joined Raymond James in Medina, Ohio, where he has been registered since late September. At Wells Fargo Advisors, Short had managed $216 million in client assets and last year generated $668,000 in revenue. Short told Reuters he first started looking at options outside of Wells Fargo Advisors last September. He also considered moving to Morgan Stanley , Benjamin F. Edwards & Co and Hillard Lyons. “What really prompted us to make a move from Wells Fargo to Raymond James was my visit to the home office,” Short said of his trip to the firm’s St. Petersburg, Florida headquarters in January. “You really get the feeling you’re back with an investment company that really cares about the brokers,” he said. Short started as a broker at A.G. Edwards Inc in 1999, later joined Wachovia Securities after the firm was bought in 2007, and remained with company when it was purchased by Wells Fargo Advisors in 2009. Short said the company culture of Raymond James was a big draw for him after coming from the brokerage arm of a big bank. “The biggest change is how helpful they are in getting things done,” he said. “At the large firms, it’s really not that way. They have a lot more people to deal with.” At his new post, Short shares an office with three other advisers and reports to branch manager Guy Jardine, who he had formerly worked with at A.G. Edwards. Short said he plans to bring all his clients over to Raymond James, but that he would be satisfied if at least 80 percent of his clients made the move. He will be joined by Lois Stephan, a registered sales associate of eight years, who had worked with Short at Wells Fargo.

283,WFC,Merrill hires $8 mln Credit Suisse broker team,"* Merrill adds Credit Suisse team that generated $8 mln * Merrill also hires $1.3 mln Wells Fargo team By Joseph A. Giannone Oct 31 (Reuters) - Brokerage giant Merrill Lynch has hired a team of Credit Suisse financial advisers in Chicago which generated $8 million of revenue in the past year and managed $1.2 billion in client assets. Bruce Lee and Jim Hoesley joins Merrill’s high-end Private Banking & Investment Group as private wealth advisers. Lee, a top 100 adviser according to Barron’s magazine for the past five years, will also assume a national role in attracting more “ultra high net worth” clients to Merrill. Credit Suisse Private Banking did not immediately comment on the move. Parent company Credit Suisse Group in September said it was reviewing its global private banking strategy, and some industry executives speculate that the Swiss bank may sell or pare down its U.S. broker-dealer, a business with higher expenses and lower profitability than other bank sectors. Merrill, the second-largest U.S. brokerage by assets and financial advisers, also hired a trio of Wells Fargo Advisors brokers in Savannah, Georgia. Chris Sotus, Mike McCullough, and Alex Jarman as a team produced $1.3 million of fees and commissions from clients with $257 million in assets at Wells Fargo . Lee’s brokerage career stretches back to 1986, when he joined Bear Stearns, and includes a stint at Lehman Brothers. He also worked at Warburg Dillon Read in 1998, which became part of UBS through a merger that year. Lee jumped to Morgan Stanley in 2000 and then again to Credit Suisse, where he has worked since 2004.

284,WFC,ALLOCATIONS-Merrill weighs scaling back equity exposure,"* Firms predict volatility will stay through year-end * Greek leader’s move shows obstacles for EU’s progress By Jessica Toonkel Nov 1 (Reuters) - After enjoying the best month for stocks in over nine years, Merrill Lynch may soon be joining the herd and scaling back exposure to equities in its portfolios. Bank of America’s Merrill has been the lone optimist on Wall Street, as its competitors Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, Wells Fargo Advisors and UBS all cut equity exposure in their portfolios just days before the October rally began. While Morgan Stanley’s pullback from equities was its most dramatic reallocation since 2009, Merrill remained overweight on equities and bullish about the economy overall. But Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou’s unexpected call late on Monday for a referendum on the financial rescue package put forth by European leaders has investment strategists at Merrill reconsidering that stance. “What happened in Greece overnight removed some of our tactical optimism,” said Kate Moore, global equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Merrill’s investment team is currently reevaluating its calls and will decide later this week whether to adjust. Last Thursday’s announcement from European leaders that there was an agreement to bail out eurozone banks had renewed the firm’s conviction in its stance, Moore said. Bank of America Merrill has maintained its “moderate” overweight position on both its short-term tactical portfolios and its long-term strategic portfolios over the last month. The firm will announce any changes to its allocations on Thursday. Bank of America Merrill will announce on Nov. 15 any changes to its strategic portfolios. While Bank of America believes the U.S. economy will grow 3 percent in the fourth quarter, it also anticipates continued swings in the markets as the situation in Europe evolves, Moore said. Investment strategists at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, Wells Fargo and UBS all told Reuters that they are not scaling back equity exposure in their portfolios further. UBS shifted its portfolios from neutral to underweight equities on Sept. 18 and is sticking to that for now. “What we learned last night is what the implementation risk looks like,” said Jeremy Zirin, chief equity strategist of wealth management at UBS . “When political outcomes drive the markets, it creates a lot more volatility.” Similarly, on Oct. 1, Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage arm of Wells Fargo & Co. went from neutral to underweight on its equity exposure on its cyclical asset allocation. “The number of things that could upset the markets are uncountable and they are political and that’s going to create volatility for the markets between now and the end of the year,” said Paul Christopher, chief international strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors. MSSB, the brokerage arm of Morgan Stanley on Oct. 6 shifted the allocation of its portfolios from overweight on global equities, commodities and REITs to underweight and from underweight on global cash to overweight, the biggest shift the firm has made since April 2009. The firm would consider reducing its equity exposure even more if the issues affecting developed markets spread into emerging markets, said Jeff Applegate, chief investment strategist at MSSB. He said the firm got more cautious a month ago because it believed policymakers in Europe and the U.S. were not responding appropriately or engaging adequately in the problems confronting them. “This latest development from Greece unfortunately shows more of the same,” Applegate said.

285,WFC,"ON THE MOVE: Wells Fargo, UBS, Benjamin Edwards add advisers","Nov 1 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo Advisors, UBS AG’s U.S. wealth management unit, and the boutique brokerage firm Benjamin F. Edwards & Co recently have expanded their adviser ranks with new hires: Wells Fargo & Co said on Tuesday the company has hired a former Morgan Stanley Smith Barney team with a combined $105 million in client assets. Veteran advisers Gregory Smith and Philip Stevens, who each spent more than two decades in the industry, joined Wells Fargo Advisors in Edmond, Oklahoma, where they have been registered since Friday. The two had been with Citigroup for roughly a decade before the merger of Morgan Stanley’s wealth management group and Citi’s Smith Barney. They had also previously worked at Merrill Lynch in the late 1990s and at New York-based broker-dealer Walnut Street Securities. Smith and Stevens together generated about $1 million in revenue last year and have been an advising team for nearly three years, according to a Wells Fargo spokeswoman. The advisers are joined by financial consultant Jeffrey Price, who also came with the team from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. They now report to Wells Fargo Advisors branch manager Jeffrey James. UBS AG’s  U.S. wealth management arm has recruited a veteran Morgan Keegan adviser from Metairie, Louisiana, a financial services recruiter with knowledge of the move told Reuters on Tuesday. Hunter Charbonnet, who had been an adviser with Morgan Keegan for 11 years, has joined the New Orleans wealth management office of UBS, where he has been registered since Friday. Charbonnet is the latest of the roughly 1,200 brokers in the private client group to leave the firm since Regions Financial Corp put the $1.5 billion unit up for sale in June. He has about $45 million in client assets under management and last year generated $385,000 in revenue, according to the recruiter. St. Louis-based brokerage firm Benjamin F. Edwards & Co has hired a former Wells Fargo adviser to join its Mentor, Ohio office as a branch manager and senior vice president. Peter Ferrante, a 20-plus-year industry veteran, most recently spent six years with Wells Fargo Advisors. He started his career in the 1990s with A.G. Edwards & Sons, the firm from which Benjamin Edwards traces its ties. Over the past couple of years, Benjamin Edwards has hired dozens of legacy A.G. Edwards advisers from Wells Fargo. He is the seventh financial adviser to join the Mentor office and the second new hire from Wells Fargo since September. Ferrante is joined by senior financial associate Michele Stevens, who has worked with Ferrante for more than a decade and will assist him with client service.

The San Francisco-based lender’s withdrawal was disclosed in filings on Monday with the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. No explanation was provided. Banks that remain plaintiffs are Bank of America Corp , BNP Paribas SA , HSBC Holdings Plc , Morgan Stanley , Natixis SA , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Societe Generale and UBS AG . The banks are challenging the February 2009 split of MBIA’s municipal bond business from its structured finance operations, which suffered big losses from insuring mortgage debt. They said this left the structured finance unit undercapitalized and unable to pay billions of dollars of claims. The split was overseen by New York’s insurance commissioner at the time, Eric Dinallo, One of the banks’ lawsuits is an Article 78 proceeding, which under New York law allows challenges to state administrative rulings.

287,WFC,U.S. banks start reviewing foreclosure errors,"Nov 1 (Reuters) - Large banks on Tuesday will begin contacting borrowers who could receive financial compensation for problems that occurred during a foreclosure on their home, U.S. banking regulators announced on Tuesday. Banks and other mortgage servicers have begun mailing letters to more than 4 million borrowers who can have their cases reviewed by independent consultants hired by the banks, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said in a release. A website — www.IndependentForeclosureReview.com — and a call center have also been created for borrowers to find out how they can have their case reviewed. The outreach to borrowers is required by a settlement reached in April by 14 mortgages servicers and federal banking regulators. The agreement came after problems with mortgage practices came to light last year, including the use of “robo-signers” to sign hundreds of unread foreclosure documents a day. Under the settlement, the servicers have to take steps to clean up their foreclosure practices. They also are required to hire independent consultants, whom regulators must approve, to review foreclosures initiated in 2009 and 2010. Where problems are found, banks may have to compensate borrowers. Borrowers will have until April 30 to request a review. Bank of America Corp , Wells Fargo & Co , JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup Inc are among the banks that settled, without admitting or denying wrongdoing.",11012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/financial-regulation-occ/u-s-banks-start-reviewing-foreclosure-errors-idUSN1E7A00FZ20111101
288,WFC,"Wells Fargo combines wealth businesses, re-brands","* Wells Fargo combines Family Wealth and Lowry Hill units * Renames joint firm as ‘Abbot Downing’ * Says transition will be complete in April 2012 By Ashley Lau Nov 1 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Company is combining two of the company’s wealth management units into one business catering to clients with $50 million or more in investable assets, the firm said on Tuesday. Wells Fargo is banking on the growth of America’s ultra-high-net-worth segment with its newly branded Abbot Downing business. The San Francisco-based company said its $4.7 billion boutique subsidiary firm Lowry Hill and its $22.8 billion Family Wealth unit will become one business under the Abbot Downing label by next April. The move effectively increases the client asset minimum for Lowry Hill five-fold from its current $10 million minimum, though the firm said its existing clients will be grandfathered in. “We’re not in the business of turning away clients,” Wells’ head of wealth, brokerage and retirement, David Carroll, said in an interview. “Many that wouldn’t fit that threshold over time will, and those that don’t, we would happily like to fit them over there.” Jim Steiner, who will be head of the new Abbot Downing, told Reuters the decision to bring the two businesses together stemmed from the opportunity the company saw among ultra-high-net-worth individuals and families living in the United States. Steiner estimates there are about 10,000 households in the United States with $50 million or more in investable assets. In an October study of 72 multifamily advising firms, the average client asset size was $48.4 million, according to research and consulting firm Family Wealth Alliance. “When you take that pool, it’s well over a trillion in assets,” Steiner said. “The market opportunity is fairly significant.” Steiner, who was previously managing principal at the 72-employee Lowry Hill, will run the new business from its headquarters in Minneapolis. In his new role, he will oversee roughly 300 employees in 14 offices around the country. The combined firm will have $27.5 billion in assets. “These are two businesses that operated fairly independently within Wells,” Carroll said. “As we looked at the market opportunity, we realized that clients in each of these businesses could benefit from something that the others had.” The decision to re-brand the combined business, rather than simply take the name of the larger Wells Fargo Family Wealth firm, was about maintaining a small-firm feel. The move is similar to renaming of SunTrust’s Asset Management Advisors to GenSpring in 2007, said Family Wealth Alliance CEO Tom Livergood. “(It’s) quite savvy,” Livergood said. “They are making a boutique feel out of this with the backing of a strong institution.” Steiner said the firm will keep a low client-to-adviser ratio of between 15-to-one on the low end and 30-to-one on the high end. “They want to have the heft and strength and stability of a large brand, yet they want to have a customized client experience,” Livergood noted. Abbot Downing will be the fourth business under the Wells’ Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement Group umbrella, which also includes an institutional business, a private bank and a brokerage arm. The decision to bring Lowry Hill into the fold has already resulted in the departure of nearly half of the firm’s managing partners. Six former Lowry Hill members left in September to open the Minneapolis branch of Evercore Wealth Management. “Lowry Hill had always been a smaller entrepreneurial firm,” former Lowry Hill employee Martha Pomerantz told Reuters in September when she left the firm for Evercore. She said there was concern that the firm was “losing its high touch service” after the acquisition. “Any time you have one firm buying another, you’re not going to be able to please everyone,” said financial services recruiter Ron Edde of Armstrong Financial Group. “Almost invariably you see some defections; some is immediate, some is delayed.” ",11012011,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-wealth-merger/wells-fargo-combines-wealth-businesses-re-brands-idUSN1E7A009720111101
289,WFC,"UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo CFO ""optimistic"" on dividend increase","* CFO says bank will look to increase dividend * Wells hasn’t finalized plan to be submitted to Fed By Rick Rothacker Nov 3 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co will look to increase its dividend and buy more back shares as part of the capital plan it submits to the Federal Reserve next year, Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said. The San Francisco-based bank has not decided on its recommendation but has a “good story” to tell the Fed after reporting record quarterly earnings this year, Sloan said at the BancAnalysts Association of Boston conference Thursday. “We’re very optimistic that as part of that process we can increase the dividend and continue to buy shares back,” Sloan said. In March, Wells increased its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share from 5 cents after the Fed’s review of its capital plan. The No. 4 U.S. bank by assets also increased the company’s authority to repurchase common stock by an additional 200 million shares. In the third quarter, Wells Fargo paid out about 17 percent of its earnings per share as dividends. On Wednesday, the bank said it was under contract to buy loans with a face value of $3.3 billion, backed by U.S. commercial real estate, from Irish Bank Resolution Corp, formerly known as Anglo Irish Bank. In the third quarter, it bought $1.1 billion of commercial loans from Bank of Ireland, and last week a source told Reuters that Wells had teamed up with Blackstone Group LP to buy a pool of loans with a face value of about $600 million from Allied Irish Banks Plc . “We think that will continue as many of the European banks, to meet the capital levels that they need to meet, are going to have to shrink a bit,” Sloan said. “They’re going to look at some of the assets and operations in the U.S. and shrink those and likely sell some of those loans and assets.” In its consumer banking business, Wells Fargo last week stopped testing a $3 monthly debit card fee for customers in five states, joining other big banks that abandoned the charges after a consumer backlash. New regulations have changed how banks can price their products, and consumers clearly don’t want to pay higher fees, Sloan said. “We think there is a fundamental change going on in the consumer business today,” he said. “Clearly, how we made our revenue has changed forever.” Wells Fargo is looking at how it structures and prices its products, Sloan said, without giving further details. Wells can benefit from its focus on customer relationships and the convenience of its nationwide branch network, he said. “There is no question in our minds that in our consumer businesses we can continue to grow revenues even in this environment,” he said. Wells Fargo shares were down less than 1 percent in morning trading at $25.29.

Raymond Stacy and Christopher Pieper joined Merrill Lynch last Friday, bringing with them more than a decade each in the advising industry. Stacy and Pieper collectively managed about $167 million in assets at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and last year produced roughly $1.6 million in revenue. The advisers came from the Morgan Stanley side of the merger with Citi’s Smith Barney unit, having both started at Dean Witter.

293,WFC,UPDATE 2-Clipper Fund gets gold in new Morningstar rating,"* Clipper Fund wins highest gold rating * Wells Fargo fund gets negative rating * Jeffrey Gundlach’s DoubleLine fund ranked neutral By Jessica Toonkel Nov 15 (Reuters) - Morningstar Inc assigned the Davis Selected Advisers’ Clipper Fund a gold rating on Tuesday, making it the only one-star fund to receive the top accolade under its new system. The new criteria, which considers management quality and other non-performance factors, lifted Davis Selected even though it has struggled in recent years, said Karen Dolan, Morningstar’s director of fund analysis. “The fund had a really bad 2008, there is no sugarcoating it,” she said. “But the team running it has been in place since 2006 and they have low fees.” For the past five years, the fund has lost 3.51 percent, underperforming its peers by almost 3 percent, according to Morningstar. But since 1999 the Clipper managed account which is similar to the fund has returned 55 percent cumulatively as of Sept. 30, compared to the S&P; 500 Index, which has returned 11 percent for the same time frame. The Clipper Fund is a concentrated portfolio of less than 30 holdings, yet Morningstar believes that its portfolio managers, Chris Davis and Ken Feinberg, balance the risks of a concentrated portfolio by having diversified large-cap stocks. Top holdings include financials like American Express Co , Berkshire Hathaway and Bank of New York Mellon , as well as Costco Wholesale Corp and Procter & Gamble Co. For the most part, funds with five stars achieved gold status under the new rating system, and vice versus. But there were a few funds that fell in status under the new ratings. The Chicago-based research firm announced in June that it was developing its new rating system released on Tuesday to complement its star ratings. While the star ratings primarily account for past performance, the new rankings are based on five criteria: the managers of the fund; the parent organization; the expenses of the fund; past performance and the fund’s process, which includes how much risk the fund is taking. There are times when a fund can lose a star rating based on past performance, but Morningstar’s analysts still like the managers and the way the fund is run, said Don Phillips, president of fund research. These new ratings, which include gold, silver, bronze, neutral and negative, take Morningstar analysts’ views into account. “If you hire someone, you look at their transcripts, but we all know that doesn’t tell the whole story,” Phillips said. “A student with a B or C average can be a great employee.” Most notably, Morningstar gave the four-star Wells Fargo Advantage Ultra Short Term Income Fund a negative ranking, despite beating its peers’ returns for the past three, five and 10 years. It’s the only four-star fund to receive a negative rating. “We think the fund takes a lot of credit risk particularly given that most people buy ultra short funds as alternatives to money market funds,” Dolan said. “It’s not a statement on the raw returns. It’s more about the risks it is taking given its conservative mandate.” The Wells Fargo fund’s inclusion of lower-rated credits is intentional and “has not led to increased volatility for the investor nor category-lagging returns,” wrote John Roehm, a Wells Fargo Funds spokesman, in an e-mail. “We believe in the investment management team’s investment process and have comfort in their credit analysis and risk management capabilities.” One surprise among Morningstar’s neutral rankings was Jeffrey Gundlach’s DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund . The fund does not have a star rating because it is not yet three-years old — the minimum age for a fund to have a star rating — it has stellar performance. The $12.8 billion fund has returned 8.67 percent this year, beating its peers by more than 3 percent, according to Morningstar. A DoubleLine spokesman did not return a call for comment. While Morningstar thinks highly of Gundlach, the firm believes that his fund, like the Wells Fargo fund, takes on too much risk, Dolan said. “You just don’t get a yield over the last 12 months like that without taking on risk,” Dolan said. “The layer of risk the fund is taking gives us pause.” ",11152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/morningstar-ratings/update-2-clipper-fund-gets-gold-in-new-morningstar-rating-idUSN1E7AE1JJ20111115

297,WFC,ON THE MOVE: Robert Baird hires advisers in western U.S.,"Nov 16 (Reuters) - Robert W. Baird & Co said on Wednesday it hired seven new advisers to help expand its presence in states including Colorado and California. The new hires, which include recruits from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Wells Fargo Advisors, managed a combined $717 million in client assets at their previous firms. Baird has hired more than 200 financial advisers and branch managers for its private wealth group over the past three years. “We’ve had a pretty good year, percentage-wise,” said John Mabee, vice chairman of the firm’s Private Wealth Management group. “There’s so much unrest at all of the major wirehouses right now, and more and more financial advisers are looking to see what alternatives there could be.” Baird is an attractive destination for financial advisers because it is privately-held and employee-owned, Mabee said. Out of the firm’s roughly 2,700 associates, about 1,100 of them are shareholders, he said. In Colorado, adviser Philip Holbert has joined the firm’s Denver office from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, where he managed $100 million in client assets. Holbert had been with Citigroup for nearly two decades, staying with the firm after the merger of Citi’s Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley’s wealth management division in 2009. In Utah, adviser Richard Nigro joined Baird’s Salt Lake City office, also from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. Nigro, who has worked in the industry for nearly three decades, manages $82 million in client assets. In California, advisers Daniel Cairns and John Kay have joined the firm from Wells Fargo Advisors , where they collectively managed $100 million in client assets. In Oregon, Baird has hired three advisers. Clark Robert Nye, Tom Shipley, and David Louthan have joined the firm’s Portland office. Nye manages $220 million in client assets, while Shipley manages $135 million. Louthan manages $80 million.

298,WFC,Wells Fargo cutting technology jobs in cost drive,"* Wells cutting server management jobs, employees told * “Project Compass” has been underway since last year * Staff, technology functions are targets for expense cuts By Rick Rothacker Nov 18 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co plans to cut technology and operations jobs by the end of this year as the bank tries to eliminate more than $1.5 billion of quarterly operating expenses. A server management group that employs about 500 is planning to cut about 25 staff and eliminate 30 unfilled positions, employees in the group have been told. Wells Fargo has said it is looking to trim up to $188 million of quarterly expenses for technology and staff, so more job cuts could come in this area. Most major financial institutions are looking to tighten their belts and banks often target technology because the reductions can be invisible to customers. Banks have announced more than 120,000 job cuts worldwide this year, according to a Reuters tally, amid a difficult capital markets environment, sluggish economic growth and new regulations crimping consumer banking revenue. Wells Fargo is the fourth largest U.S. bank by assets but the second largest by employees after Bank of America Corp with the equivalent of 263,800 full-time employees. The San Francisco-based bank has said Project Compass, the efficiency program it launched at the end of last year, would eliminate jobs but the bank has not disclosed a specific number as some competitors have. A bank spokesman said he could not provide details on the server management group because “outcomes are not final.” The bank may add staff to some groups even as it cuts from others, said Wells spokesman Ancel Martinez, adding that  laid-off employees can seek jobs in other parts of the company. The bank is trying to cut costs by operating more efficiently, Martinez said. The bank has said Project Compass aims to reduce quarterly expenses to $11 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012 from about $12.5 billion in the second quarter of this year. Quarterly expenses in technology and staff areas were around $2.2 billion in the second quarter, the bank has said. Wells is centralizing some staff functions and simplifying its technology operations as part of the program. The bank has technology hubs in Charlotte, North Carolina; Scottsdale, Arizona; Minneapolis and San Francisco. Wells acquired Charlotte-based Wachovia Corp in 2008 and is in the final stages of knitting together the operations. This week, Charlotte-based Bank of America began issuing layoff notices to technology and operations employees as part of an efficiency program that is expected to eliminate 30,000 positions over the next few years. Bank of America had 288,739 employees at the end of the third quarter.",11182011,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-layoffs/wells-fargo-cutting-technology-jobs-in-cost-drive-idUSN1E7AH1RM20111118

302,WFC,UPDATE 1-U.S. Justice Department reviewing debit card fees,"* Justice reviewing banks, trade groups on debit fees * Rep. Welch had called for antitrust probe * Banks have since scrapped fee hikes amid public pressure * Retail groups file suit against Fed over swipe fee cap By Alexandra Alper Nov 22 (Reuters) - The Justice Department is reviewing allegations by a U.S lawmaker that U.S. banks and their trade associations may have coordinated increases in debit card fees in violation of antitrust laws. Assistant Attorney General Ronald Weich said in a letter released on Tuesday that the Department of Justice is taking a look at statements and actions by the banks and trade groups. “Please be assured that if it finds that individuals, banks, or other parties may have violated the antitrust laws, the department will take appropriate action,” Weich said in a Nov. 16 letter to Democratic Representative Peter Welch. Welch in October called on the Justice Department to probe the banks. He said public statements by big banks and trade groups — including Wells Fargo and the American Bankers Association — raised questions about whether financial companies have colluded on fee increases to make up for revenue lost because of a new cap on debit card “swipe fees”. That controversial cap on swipe fees, known as the Durbin amendment, went into effect on Oct. 1. The cap is expected to cost banks $6.6 billion in annual revenue from debit card processing fees that banks charge retailers. Banks initially defended the new debit card fees, saying they had to make up for lost revenue from retailers, but most scrapped them when faced with customer backlash. “While big banks like Bank of America beat a hasty retreat on their debit card fee strategies, I have no doubt that they will continue their quest to dig deeper into the pockets of struggling consumers,” Welch said in a statement on Tuesday. “They should be aware that there is a cop actively on the beat.” Bank of America , Wells Fargo and the ABA had no comment on the issue. Separately on Tuesday, the National Retail Federation and other retail advocates filed suit against the Federal Reserve, which was tasked with setting the swipe fee caps under last year’s Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act. In the lawsuit, filed in Washington D.C.’s U.S. district court, the NRF said the Fed bowed to pressure from banking industry groups and based its cap on costs banned from consideration by the law. The result, according to the group, is that banks are still charging unjustifiably high swipe fees. “The Federal Reserve was required by law to come up with swipe fees that were ‘reasonable’ and ‘proportional,’ but what we got were neither,” said NRF Senior Vice President Mallory Duncan. Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic Payments Coalition, which has pushed hard against the swipe fee caps, disagreed, chocking the suit up to greed. “Retailers won’t truly be happy until they pay zero to accept cards,” she wrote in an email. A Federal Reserve spokesperson said, “We are aware of this lawsuit and we will be reviewing it.”",11232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/financial-regulation-justice/update-1-u-s-justice-department-reviewing-debit-card-fees-idUSN1E7AL23020111123

305,WFC,S&P; criteria change reduces ratings on big banks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Standard & Poor’s reduced its credit ratings on 15 big banking companies, mostly in the Europe and United States, on Tuesday as the result of a sweeping overhaul of its ratings criteria. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Barclays Plc (BARC.L), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) and UBS AG UBSN.VX, were among the banks that had their ratings reduced by one notch each. A notch is one third of a letter rating. S&P; also left the ratings of 20 banks as they were and raised the ratings of two in announcing results from its new ratings criteria to 37 of the world’s biggest banking companies. The agency also updated ratings for dozens of bank subsidiaries of the companies. Although S&P; began warning the markets more than a year ago that it was revising its ratings, the announcement comes at a time when the markets for bank debts are fragile. “Banks could see higher funding costs,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. S&P; officials said earlier this month they would gradually roll out the updated ratings for more than 750 banking companies worldwide, starting with an announcement about the biggest banks. The remaining announcements are due in coming weeks. The outcome of the re-rating of the biggest banks was worse than S&P; has forecast for all banks. S&P; officials said earlier this month they expected about 20 percent of all banks would see their ratings drop, while 20 percent would get higher ratings and 60 percent would stay the same. Spokespersons for Bank of America, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley declined to comment. S&P;’s overhaul is part of a broad, multi-year drive by the agency to improve its products and repair its reputation, which was badly tarnished by having wrongly put triple-A ratings on securities backed by subprime mortgages. The agency is owned by  McGraw-Hill Companies Inc MHP.N. In response to growing pressure on their credit ratings, some banks have updated contingency plans for a downgrade. They have also refreshed disclosures on the potential impact they may suffer through ratings triggers built into obligations under existing derivatives contracts, funding commitments and borrowing arrangements.

311,WFC,UPDATE 3-Wells Fargo well positioned for stress test - CEO,"* Wells to return capital to shareholders next year - CEO * Fed to test banks’ capacity to withstand crises By Rick Rick Rothacker Dec 6 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co is “well positioned” for upcoming stress tests of the largest U.S. banks, Chief Executive John Stumpf said on Tuesday. The fourth-largest U.S. bank looks forward to returning more capital to shareholders next year, Stumpf said at a Goldman Sachs financial services conference in New York. He did not provide specifics on the bank’s plans. Wells is one of six large U.S. banks that will face additional scrutiny of their exposure to the European debt crisis. The bank has no “sovereign claims” against the five countries at the center of the crisis, Stumpf said. The bank’s “gross outside exposure” to those five countries was $3.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, he said. Wells had total loans of $760 billion at the end of the third quarter. The Federal Reserve plans to release results of the stress tests in March. In the fourth quarter, Wells expects higher mortgage fee income, but also expects higher noninterest expenses from the mortgage business and its 2008 acquisition of financial services company Wachovia, Stumpf said. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate that Wells Fargo will earn 72 cents per share in the fourth quarter, up from 61 cents a year earlier. Wells Fargo continues to adjust to regulations that have crimped revenue from consumer banking, Stumpf said. To cover the $200 to $300 it costs to provide a checking account, the bank is encouraging customers to do more business with the bank by offering packages of products and services, he said. Some customers, however, do not pay that way and the bank is testing monthly charges for them, he said. Customers, though, have clearly said they do not want to pay a monthly debit card fee, he said. Wells canceled a test of a $3 monthly debit fee in October, joining other banks who backed off such charges after a backlash from consumers and lawmakers.",12062011,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-stumpf/update-3-wells-fargo-well-positioned-for-stress-test-ceo-idUSN1E7B507X20111206
312,WFC,ON THE MOVE: Wells Fargo adviser returns to Weston roots,"Dec 7 (Reuters) - More than two decades after adviser Drew Bottaro left the boutique wealth manager Weston Financial for a job at Deloitte, and later Wells Fargo, the Massachusetts-based adviser has returned to his roots — as vice president of the firm. Bottaro, who most recently served as a senior relationship manager at Wells Fargo’s ultra-high-net-worth family wealth unit, rejoined Weston Financial in October, the firm said late Tuesday. “I left when they were still going strong,” he said in an interview on Wednesday. “In the late 80s, Weston Financial was a pioneer in the comprehensive financial planning field.” In the intervening years, the Wellesley-based firm was acquired by parent company Washington Trust Wealth Management, which has about $4 billion in assets under management. “A lot of it still the same,” he said. “The business model is still fee-based financial planning and investment advisory services.” In his new role, Bottaro serves as both an adviser for the firm’s high-net-worth clients and as an internal resource for other Weston Financial advisers, helping out with the firm’s business development. After his initial departure from Weston in the late 80s, Bottaro spent roughly a decade at the accounting firm Deloitte, where he advised corporate executives and high-net-worth individuals in financial and estate planning. “It’s interesting how culturally easy it was to return to my professional cultural roots,” Bottaro said. “It’s where I formed a lot of my professional values, which are still intact.” ",12072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/washtrust-hire/on-the-move-wells-fargo-adviser-returns-to-weston-roots-idUSN1E7B60A020111207
313,WFC,ON THE MOVE: Wells Fargo hires MSSB adviser team,"Dec 7 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo Advisors, the nation’s third largest brokerage, has recruited four Morgan Stanley Smith Barney advisers that together produced more than $3 million in revenue last year, the firm said on Wednesday. Richard Ranieri, David Roberts, Michael Rosenberg and Tonia Dillon joined Wells Fargo’s Melville, New York office. They had collectively managed $545 million in client assets. “When big brokers move, it makes a statement,” said Texas-based financial services recruiter Rick Peterson, who works with advisers at the nation’s top brokerages. “There’s a dwindling pool of available candidates, so there’s a supply-demand issue,” he said, noting that many existing retention packages do not expire until the new calendar year. “A lot of people who have moved over the last few years are under contract, so that diminishes the pool available.” Including the new additions, Wells Fargo has hired at least nine advisers from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney since late October.

314,WFC,"Wachovia agrees to $148 million pact with SEC, states","(Reuters) - Wachovia Bank, owned by Wells Fargo & Co, agreed to pay $148 million in a settlement with federal and state authorities over allegations of bid-rigging and other abuses in the municipal bond derivatives market. Wachovia rigged at least 48 municipal bond reinvestment transactions in 25 states and Puerto Rico, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement announcing the pact on Thursday. The SEC said Wachovia agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations. Wells Fargo joins JPMorgan Chase & Co UBS AG and Bank of America Corp in settling with the government in a wide-ranging investigation that has netted $673 million in penalties and restitution. Municipal bond derivatives are contracts used to reinvest proceeds of bond sales until the funds are needed or to hedge interest-rate risk. Wachovia engaged in fraudulent bidding for these contracts from at least 1997 to 2005, according to the SEC’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey. The settlement requires court approval. The settlement includes a pact reached with 26 state attorneys general. Wachovia agreed to pay $54.5 million to state agencies, municipalities, school districts and nonprofits that entered into municipal bond derivative contracts with the bank between 1998 and 2004. The bank also agreed to pay the states a $1.25 million civil penalty and $3 million in fees and costs related to the probe. “My office has zero tolerance for such financial misconduct and will continue to work to hold those at fault responsible,” New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. Wells Fargo said in a statement the underlying transactions involved employees who are no longer with the firm. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo acquired Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia in 2008 at the peak of the financial crisis. The SEC said the bank won these contracts by obtaining information from bidding agents about competing bids and through “set-ups” in which bidding agents deliberately obtained non-winning bids, the SEC said. Wachovia also helped other bidders by deliberately submitting low bids, the agency said. “Wachovia won bids by playing an elaborate game of ‘you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours,’ rather than engaging in legitimate competition to win municipalities’ business,” Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said in a statement. The SEC did not file any charges against individuals associated with Wachovia. Wachovia also reached agreements with the U.S. Justice Department, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Internal Revenue Service. In November, Wells Fargo disclosed that it had also agreed to pay $37 million to resolve civil lawsuits brought by municipalities. Separately, the SEC said on Thursday that former Bank of America vice president Dean Pinard had agreed to pay $40,000 to settle charges of improper bid-rigging practices. He neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s findings. ",12082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wellsfargo-settlement/wachovia-agrees-to-148-million-pact-with-sec-states-idUSTRE7B71NI20111208
315,WFC,Liquidity twist on bank liability management,"LONDON, Dec 8 (IFR) - Wells Fargo and Yorkshire Building Society joined the bulging liability management pipeline on Thursday, although unlike recent exercises conducted by European banks, they cited liquidity as the rationale for their deals. Yorkshire Building Society will be the first UK issuer to take advantage of a change in the country’s government-guarantee scheme issues to buy-back government-guaranteed debt and cancel it ahead of its maturity. “This buyback facility will be subject to certain conditions and the payment to HM Treasury of a cancellation fee,” a UK treasury statement said in June. “Participating issuers will be charged 15% of the fees they would have paid had their bonds been carried to their original maturity dates.” HSBC and JP Morgan are handling the trade which is targeting GBP1.5bn of government-guaranteed debt maturing next year. The offer is capped at a maximum of GBP750m however. The exercise targets three bonds in dollars, euros and sterling: USD350m, EUR750m and a GBP600m. Yorkshire is paying a premium over where the bonds were trading in the secondary market, although a banker close to the deal said it was difficult to calculate how much it was exactly as the securities are very illiquid. The banks is offering 100.25 on the dollar, Gilts flat on the sterling and 40bp over Bunds for the euros. In a statement, Yorkshire said that the tender would help optimise its available liquidity and its obligations under the UK government 2008 Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS). “The key driver behind the buy-back is to cancel the fee they have to pay on the outstanding deals as one of the conditions for the usage of the CGS was the payment of the fee to the DMO,” said a banker close to the exercise. “However, it will also help the issuer smooth out its maturity profile.” He added that he did not expect a large wave of exercises to follow in the footsteps of Yorkshire. “Realistally in the UK, time is running out,” he said. “The saving banks can make is proportional to how much time the securities have left to run and in a lot of cases, deals are maturing very soon.” Investors have until December 15 to make their decision and the results are expected to be announced on December 16. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo announced it was tendering for a EUR1.5bn May 2013 issue via Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. The issuer said it would accept up to EUR500m and that it would buy the bonds back at 45bp over mid-swaps although it said it may accept “significantly less or significantly more” than this. The bank said in a statement that the purpose of the deal was to reduce short-term debt with available cash on hand. “This is a very simple cash management situation,” a banker involved in the trade said. “The bond has a high coupon of 6% and Wells would rather get rid of it and move on. This is not really a bank trade, this is more akin to what a corporate would do.” Wells Fargo is paying a much lower cost to buy back the bonds than where similarly-rated European banks trade, which the banker estimated to be between 150bp and 200bp extra. Investors have until December 16 to make their decisions and the results are expected to come out after December 19.",12082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/banks-liability-management/liquidity-twist-on-bank-liability-management-idUSL5E7N82B520111208
316,WFC,"Wells Fargo to Pay 'Defamed' Broker $500,000","Dec 13 (Reuters) - A unit of Wells Fargo & Co must pay $500,000 to a broker who alleged the firm made defamatory statements about him in a regulatory filing, according to a ruling by a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority arbitration panel. The ruling, which includes $400,000 in punitive damages, is rare, lawyers said, because brokerages are often successful in arguing that statements they make in a document they must file with regulators when a broker leaves the firm, known as Form U5, are privileged. Maxim Minevich, a former broker at a Baltimore office of Wells Fargo Advisors LLC, originally sought nearly $4 million in damages, when he filed the claim in late 2010, according to the ruling last Thursday. Minevich alleged the firm reported defamatory information about him in a regulatory filing with FINRA after wrongfully terminating him in 2010. A FINRA panel in Baltimore agreed with Minevich, finding that his termination was based on information from a manager who provided “false, misleading and inaccurate” information, according to the ruling. The manager, who previously showed “personal animus” against Minevich, “used a single customer complaint” that was “quickly and easily resolved” as the incident that led to his termination, the panel wrote. Arbitrators recommended expunging the erroneous statement from the firm’s original filing for Minevich. Expungement recommendations must be approved by a court. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo decline to comment. Minevich’s lawyer did not return calls seeking comment. “It’s an achievement,” said Laurence Moy, a lawyer for Outten & Golden LLP in New York who represents financial professionals in employment disputes. Defamation law in Maryland may have helped Minevich’s claim, said Moy, who was not involved in the case. The outcome would have been highly unlikely in New York, Moy said. In 2007, a state court ruled that brokerages are immune from defamation statements made in such documents. A punitive damages award is also unusual, as arbitrators did not have to award more than compensatory damages, Moy said. “When you get to the point where you’ve won a punitive award for defamation, you’ve reached a point where the arbitrators were incensed about the bank’s conduct,” he said.

318,WFC,FINRA fines Wells Fargo $2 million for sales abuses,"* Broker sold risky, complex notes to elderly customers * FINRA files civil enforcement case against broker * Broker allegedly traded in dead clients’ accounts By Suzanne Barlyn Dec 15 (Reuters) - The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fined a unit of Wells Fargo & Co $2 million on Thursday for unsuitable sales of a complex type of bond to 21 customers through former brokers. FINRA also charged the broker, Alfred Chi Chen, in a civil enforcement complaint, alleging that he sold the unsuitable securities and made unauthorized trades in several customer accounts, including those of dead clients. The securities, known as reverse convertibles, are interest bearing notes in which the repayment of principal is tied to the performance of an underlying asset, such as stock. Investors can lose money on the notes if the value of those assets falls below a certain level when it matures, or during the term of the note. FINRA alleged that Chen, between 2006 and 2008, recommended hundreds of reverse convertibles to clients, many of whom were over 80 years old and not in a position to make risky investments, according to FINRA’s complaint. He was allegedly “so relentless” in switching his customers into the securities that he became the highest producer of reverse convertibles for 2008 at Wells Fargo Investments LLC., the unit fined by FINRA on Thursday. Wells Fargo Investments is now part of Wells Fargo Advisors LLC. Chen, who worked out of Wells Fargo bank branch offices in the Sacramento, California area, got most of his customers through referrals from bank employees, according to the complaint. Chen did not immediately return calls requesting comment. Wells terminated Chen in November 2008, according to FINRA. FINRA’s $2 million fine against Wells Fargo Investments on Thursday also resolves charges that the firm did not give eligible customers sales charge discounts on transactions in unit investment trusts. The trusts are a type of investment company that holds a fixed portfolio of securities and offers redeemable units of that portfolio that terminate after a certain time period. Wells Fargo, who did not admit nor deny FINRA’s findings, agreed to pay restitution to those customers and also certain customers who engaged in unsuitable reverse processes and procedures in place to prevent this kind of activity from happening,” a Wells Fargo spokesman said in a statement.” ",12152011,http://www.reuters.com/article/finra-fines-wells/finra-fines-wells-fargo-2-million-for-sales-abuses-idUSN1E7BE0CM20111215

321,WFC,"ON THE MOVE: Raymond James hires Wells Fargo, UBS advisers","Dec 27 (Reuters) - Raymond James has hired two former Wells Fargo advisers and one former UBS adviser who together managed more than $500 million to open the firm’s first office in Jackson, Mississippi, the company said on Tuesday. Advisers Arthur Finkelberg, Butch McKenzie and Albert Green joined Raymond James’ employee broker-dealer division in early December — the third team of large producers that the firm said it has brought on board this month. Raymond James also said this month it hired three advisers from UBS and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in Miami and four advisers from Merrill Lynch in Virginia Beach.and “It’s (the new Jackson practice) a small office with three producers starting out, but we’re going to build up one adviser at a time,” McKenzie said in an interview, referring to his new office in Jackson. McKenzie, a two-decade industry veteran, had previously worked with Green at PaineWebber and later with Finkelberg at A.G. Edwards. He said he first considered a move four years ago when A. G. Edwards was acquired by Wachovia, which a year later was acquired by Wells Fargo. “Arty and I had been A.G. Edwards guys,” he said. “We felt that Raymond James had a lot of similarities with the old A.G. firm, and we liked what we saw... client-first, conservative, well-managed.” While McKenzie and Finkelberg were most recently with Wells Fargo , where they managed almost $400 million in combined client assets, Green was most recently with UBS  , where he managed almost $150 million in client assets. The three advisers altogether generated roughly $3 million in revenue last year. Finkelberg, who started his career in the early 80s at Merrill Lynch, was recognized by Barron’s as one of the top advisers in the state of Mississippi earlier this year. “As Raymond James continues to expand along the Gulf Coast, we are looking for advisors of this caliber and reputation to join our growing division,” said regional complex manager Tom Galvin. While the advisers’ Jackson office is the first employee broker-dealer office to open in the region, Raymond James Financial Services, the firms’ independent broker-dealer, already has 16 independent offices in the state.

James Schmidt and Bernice “Bernie” Murff are the latest in a string of new hires who have joined the firm from the largest U.S. brokerages. In the past three weeks, Raymond James  said it has added 16 new advisers who managed about $1.5 billion in client assets at their previous firms. “We’re positioning ourselves as the premiere alternative to Wall Street, both for advisers and clients,” Raymond James & Associates President Tash Elwyn said. “We’ve married the scope and scale of the wirehouse with the regional firm feel.” Schmidt and Murff together managed more than $90 million in client assets at Wells Fargo and together generated about $1.1 million in revenue last year. They joined Raymond James’ employee broker-dealer division in early December. The two advisers are joined by their client service associate Tameika Aldridge and report to complex manager Tony Barrett. Schmidt, a 28-year industry veteran, had been with Wells Fargo for more than a decade before moving to Raymond James. “Regional firms are the place to be for a lot of brokers now because they’re tired of problems with the wirehouses, and transition packages are decent,” said New York-based financial services recruiter Rich Schwarzkopf. Raymond James Financial has about 5,400 U.S.-based financial advisers and $268 billion in total client assets. About 1,300 of those advisers are a part of the firm’s employee broker-dealer division.

323,WFC,Possible data breach by Wells Fargo investigated,"(Reuters) - Connecticut’s attorney general is investigating a possible data breach in which Wells Fargo & Co may have disclosed customer Social Security numbers as part of a fraud investigation. The possible breach is the latest wrinkle in a probe into whether state employees falsified financial information on applications submitted for food benefits issued in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene, which struck the U.S. East Coast last fall. The state Department of Social Services had sent subpoenas to Wells Fargo seeking financial records as part of the investigation, according to a news release issued by Attorney General George Jepsen on Wednesday. The fourth-largest U.S. bank then may have provided customers copies of the subpoenas, which included Social Security numbers of multiple individuals, according to the statement. Jepsen sent a letter to Wells Fargo asking for an explanation of why the bank may have disclosed the information. Under Connecticut law, individuals or entities entrusted with Social Security numbers can’t improperly disclose them. Wells Fargo spokesman Kevin Friedlander said the bank’s focus is on its customers and other individuals who were affected. The bank will offer them the option of signing up for identity theft protection, he said. Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy last month announced an investigation into the benefits, which were made available to low-income Connecticut residents who incurred disaster-related expenses from Irene. Attorney Rich Rochlin, who represents some of the state employees under investigation, raised questions about the subpoenas in a news conference on Tuesday. He said he knows of two customers who received subpoenas containing a total of 130 names and Social Security numbers.

324,WFC,BofA and others being probed over home insurance - source,"NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The New York state’s financial regulator is probing several large banks, including Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc, on whether they overcharged customers on force-place insurance, a source familiar with the matter said. The probe centers on so-called force-place insurance — where the loan servicer steps in and buys an insurance policy in the event of a homeowner failing to keep up their insurance premiums — an increasingly common practice, the source said. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co are among the other major banks involved in the inquiry by the office of Benjamin Lawsky, the superintendent of New York State’s Department of Financial Services, the source said. Lawsky’s office has been probing banks and insurance companies on whether they are overcharging on forced place insurance, the source, who declined to be named as the matter was private, said. Lawsky was formerly an official in the New York State Attorney General’s Office under Andrew Cuomo, now the state’s governor. In the State Attorney General’s Office, Lawsky was involved in other probes of banks, including a high-profile investigation of the U.S. student loan industry. The present probe would look into whether policies being taken up by the investigated banks were issued by their own affiliates. Kickbacks between unrelated companies would also face scrutiny, according the source. An important focus for the probe will be the potential conflict at Bank of America involving a unit called Balboa Insurance that it owned until last year, the source said. A Bank of America spokesperson declined to comment on the investigation but said it is the bank’s policy to cooperate with regulatory investigations. The investigation will also probe JPMorgan because in recent years the bank held a small financial stake in an insurance company called Assurant on behalf of its clients, the source said. Citigroup, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan could not be reached for a comment outside of normal business hours. The Office of the Superintendent Of New York State’s Department Of Financial Services could not be reached immediately for a comment.

326,WFC,"Instant view: Citigroup, Wells post Q4 results","(Reuters) - Citigroup Inc reported lower fourth-quarter profit while Wells Fargo & Co. said profit rose. Both big banks said their quarters were helped by declining bad loan costs. Citi, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported net income of $1.2 billion, or 38 cents a share, down from $1.3 billion, or 43 cents a share a year earlier. Wells, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, said net income applicable to common shareholders was $3.9 billion, or 73 cents per share, compared to $3.2 billion, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier. Below are comments from analysts and investors: JEFFREY SICA, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SICA WEALTH MANAGEMENT, INDEPENDENT WEALTH MANAGER, MORRISTOWN, NJ: “We see this as a very negative reflection on (Vikram) Pandit’s ability to run Citigroup. Obviously what makes these earnings so horrendous, so disgraceful is (Citi) reported 38 cents vs the consensus view of 48 cents. But what makes it even worse is that just 60 days ago that consensus estimate was in the 80 cent range. Expenses accelerated from last quarter. They’re blaming it mostly on bond trading, which does not bode well for the future because things just won’t get better in that arena. Wells Fargo has a better business model for the environment we’re in now because commercial lending is their biggest sector. They’re not overly involved in the trading activities that the other banks are involved in. Although they were able to beat estimates, and although they’re the best of the worst, I think they’re going to see downward pressure from more continued slowing economic growth.” TODD SCHOENBERGER, managing director, LandColt Trading, Wilmington, Delaware: “Citi’s number to come in like this, still missing even though estimates were already cut, that’s a cause of great concern. Wells Fargo is decent, but in order for the market to do well, we need the big banks to do well. So this is cause for great concern, and Goldman’s number tomorrow could be the catalyst to really get us worried.” MARTY MOSBY, large-cap bank analyst, Guggenheim Partners, Memphis, Tennessee: “We’re seeing continued progress in Wells Fargo. Earnings continue to move northward and there’s still growth. We saw 2 percent sequential growth in core loans, which is nice to see. There was also an improvement in net interest margin, which had been a big concern. On the disappointing side, the expense number was higher. We were looking for greater efficiency.” DEREK PILECKI, portfolio manager, Gator Capital Management (long-short hedge fund), Tampa, Florida: “Citi’s results reflect the weak capital markets environment in the quarter but it looks like they’re making progress in building capital and their credit is continuing to improve.” BRUCE FOERSTER, president, South Beach Capital Markets, Miami: “Vikram Pandit ought to get out in front of Glass-Steagall and spin off the investment bank. Commercial banking isn’t as complicated. A spinoff would create a lot more value and allow the big retail and C&I; loan business to flourish. I think he’s cleaning it up big time. Citi is a long-term bet, but a very good bet. Wells Fargo is carrying the burden of Wachovia and World Savings on mortgages, but it has an incredible retail brokerage franchise. They beat, and I’d like to see the Fed let them up the dividend.”",1172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-citi-wells/instant-view-citigroup-wells-post-q4-results-idUSTRE80G0W020120117
327,WFC,Wells Fargo profit jumps on loan growth,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co on Tuesday beat Wall Street estimates with a 20 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit, boosted by continued loan growth and improving credit quality. The improvement at the fourth-largest U.S. bank contrasted with an 11 percent decline in profit at Citigroup Inc, which saw its capital markets business battered by the European debt crisis. “Wells Fargo has a better business model for the environment we’re in now because commercial lending is their biggest sector,” said Jeffrey Sica, president of SICA Wealth Management in Morristown, New Jersey, which is generally negative on the banking sector. “They’re not overly involved in the trading activities that the other banks are involved in.” The San Francisco-based bank said it earned 73 cents per share. The average estimate from analysts was 72 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Reflecting a trend demonstrated on Friday by results at JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo’s total loans grew about $9.5 billion from the end of September to $769.6 billion at the end of December. The bank said planned run-off of discontinued loans was more than offset by growth in a broad range of loan types, especially commercial loans. “Core” loans increased by about 2 percent from the previous quarter, although analysts noted the growth included U.S. commercial real estate loans purchased from struggling European banks. “In addition to the organic growth, we saw an opportunity from the acquisition standpoint,” said Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan in an interview. “Not everybody in the industry has the capacity (to do that).” One area where Sloan said the bank wasn’t seeing much growth was utilization of existing credit lines, typically an event that occurs as the economy rebounds. The economy is “definitely improving” but not “as fast as everyone would like,” he said. Net income applicable to common shareholders in the fourth quarter was $3.89 billion, compared with $3.23 billion, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier. For all of 2011, Wells posted net income applicable to common shareholders of about $15 billion, up from $11.6 billion in 2010. The report came the same day that Citigroup Inc posted net income of $1.16 billion, or 38 cents per share, down from $1.31 billion, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier. JPMorgan on Friday reported fourth-quarter net income of $3.72 billion, or 90 cents a share, down from $4.83 billion, or $1.12 a share, a year earlier. Wells Fargo shares climbed 1.5 percent to $30.06 in afternoon trading, while Citigroup’s fell 6.7 percent to $28.67. For a graphic on Citigroup vs. Wells Fargo results: link.reuters.com/kyw95s For a graphic on largest U.S. brokerage firms: link.reuters.com/bun95s Wells Fargo, which became a coast-to-coast bank with its 2008 purchase of Wachovia, also benefited from improving credit quality in the quarter. For the seventh straight quarter the bank reversed reserves the bank had previously booked for bad loans. The so-called reserve release in the fourth quarter was about $600 million, down from $800 million in the third quarter. The bank expects that to continue in 2012 absent “significant credit deterioration in the economy.” Still, big banks are struggling to pad revenues at a time when low interest rates make it difficult to earn money from loans and as new regulations curb fees they can charge for debit card use. Wells reported total revenue of $20.6 billion, down from $21.5 billion a year ago but up from $19.6 billion in the third quarter. The bank said debit card interchange fees were down by $365 million, although that dip was partially offset by growth in credit card fees. Mortgage banking income increased to $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $1.8 billion in the third, but down from $2.8 billion a year ago, as the bank benefited from an increase in home loan refinancings. Wells is the largest originator of home loans in the U.S. The bank also posted a $430 million gain from trading activities, an improvement from a $442 million loss in the third quarter but down about $100 million from a year ago. Sloan said capital markets were more robust in the fourth quarter than in a volatile third quarter but may never return to the levels seen in the first half of 2008. “That’s OK from our perspective,” he said. “This is a portion of our business. It’s not the primary driver for the business, which is the challenge for others because we have a more diversified model.” The bank said its U.S. investment banking market share increased to 5.1 percent in 2011 from 4.2 percent in 2010, citing Dealogic fee-based tables. In a bid to improve overall profits, Wells Fargo, like other banks, has launched a wide-ranging efficiency program called Project Compass. Wells said fourth-quarter noninterest expense was up from the third-quarter as expected on higher seasonal expenses and mortgage-related costs. But the bank reiterated its goal of reducing quarterly expenses to about $11 billion by the end of this year, a reduction of about $1.5 billion. The bank’s total employment of 264,200 was down about 8,000 from a year ago but up slightly from the third quarter. Sloan said the bank eliminated employees involved in the Wachovia merger integration last year but added employees in the mortgage business to meet rising demand in the past two quarters. Marty Mosby, bank analyst with Guggenheim Partners, said Wells Fargo showed continued progress in the quarter but was disappointing on expenses. “We were looking for greater efficiency,” he said. Like other big banks, Wells submitted a capital plan this month to the Federal Reserve as part of stress tests designed to determine if banks have enough capital in case of a severe economic downturn. Sloan did not provide specifics on Wells Fargo’s plan, but said he expects the Fed will not object to the bank’s submission, allowing it to increase its dividend and buy back more of its stock. The Fed’s response is expected in mid-March. During the fourth quarter, Wells said it purchased 27 million shares of its common stock. It also agreed to buy another 6 million shares in a transaction that will settle in the first quarter of this year. As European banks work to meet their own capital requirements, some are looking to sell off loan portfolios and business units. Wells reportedly was one of the banks interested in buying the Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc aircraft leasing unit acquired Tuesday by Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group. In a conference call with analysts, Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf said the bank is “kicking a lot of tires” but will be “cautious” about doing any deals. “It would have to make a lot of sense for us,” he said, “and if all we get out of this is sore toes, that is fine.” ",1172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wellsfargo/wells-fargo-profit-jumps-on-loan-growth-idUSTRE80G0UU20120117
328,WFC,Wells Fargo brokerage unit hit by trading slowdown,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A slowdown in trading by individual investors put a dent in Wells Fargo & Co’s fourth-quarter brokerage results, the largest U.S. bank by market value said on Tuesday. Wells Fargo Advisors said its client assets fell 3 percent to $1.13 trillion during an exceptionally choppy 2011, when the benchmark S&P; 500 Index ended the year unchanged. U.S. stocks rose 11 percent during the fourth quarter, but Standard & Poor’s Friday downgrade of nine European nations shows that financial markets are still treading thin ice. The number of advisers rose by 75 to 15,263 compared with last year, essentially flat, but still indicating the No. 3 U.S. retail brokerage held on to earlier recruiting gains, but may have lost more ground to Merrill Lynch, the second-largest U.S. brokerage with 16,722 advisers at the end of September. The San Francisco bank does not disclose financial results for its brokerage, high-end wealth management and retirement services businesses. Together, these units earned $325 million, up 65 percent from last year due to a one-time $153 million gain from Wells’ sale of H.D. Vest, an independent brokerage. Total revenue in the broader wealth division rose 1 percent to $3.07 billion from a year ago. Excluding H.D. Vest, revenue was down 4 percent due to lower commissions and a reduction in fees as client balances fell. Wells, the first of the major brokerage houses to report its December quarter results, shows that individual investors have pulled in their horns as questions about the U.S. economy, Europe’s debt crisis and political tensions worldwide have even market veterans scratching their heads. Also on Tuesday, online brokerage TD Ameritrade said its quarterly earnings rose but revenue fell as small investors stepped back from choppy markets. Bank of America, Merrill’s parent company, and Morgan Stanley, controlling owner of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, both report their quarterly results on Thursday.

329,WFC,"Instant view: Citigroup, Wells post Q4 results","(Reuters) - Citigroup Inc reported lower fourth-quarter profit while Wells Fargo & Co. said profit rose. Both big banks said their quarters were helped by declining bad loan costs. Citi, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported net income of $1.2 billion, or 38 cents a share, down from $1.3 billion, or 43 cents a share a year earlier. Wells, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, said net income applicable to common shareholders was $3.9 billion, or 73 cents per share, compared to $3.2 billion, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier.

Commercial banking isn’t as complicated. A spinoff would create a lot more value and allow the big retail and C&I; loan business to flourish. I think he’s cleaning it up big time. Citi is a long-term bet, but a very good bet. Wells Fargo is carrying the burden of Wachovia and World Savings on mortgages, but it has an incredible retail brokerage franchise.

330,WFC,"Old mortgages rise from the dead, haunt homeowners","(Reuters) - In July 2009, Roy and Sheila Bowers refinanced the mortgage on their suburban ranch home in Topeka, Kansas. The couple wanted to take advantage of the low interest rates that were all the rage at the time. Roy, a truck driver, and Sheila, a former hotel housekeeping supervisor, knew their new loan from Wells Fargo would enable them to save $198.86 a month - a nice chunk to help with gas and groceries. But what the Bowers never imagined was that their old loan, the one Wells Fargo told them was paid off, would resurrect itself, trashing their credit report, scotching their son’s student loans and throwing the whole family into foreclosure. All, they say, even though they didn’t miss a single mortgage payment. The Bowers are not alone. More and more, homeowners say that mortgages they thought were dead and buried are springing back to life, sometimes haunting them all the way into foreclosure. “It’s the most egregious manifestation of an industry that’s seriously broken,” said Ira Rheingold, a lawyer who is the executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocate. Diane Thompson, an attorney with the National Consumer Law Center, says she has defended hundreds of foreclosure cases, and in nearly all of them, the homeowner was not in default. “The record-keeping on the part of the mortgage servicers is not to be trusted.” The problems grew from a lot of sloppy recordkeeping that began during the housing boom, when Wall Street built a quick-and-dirty back-office operation to process mortgages quickly so lenders could sell as many loans as possible. As the loans were later sold to investors, and then resold around the world, the back office system sidestepped crucial legal procedures. Now it’s becoming clear just how dysfunctional and, according to several state attorneys general, how fraudulent the whole system was. Depositions from “affidavit slaves” depict a surreal, assembly-line world in which the banks and their partner firms hired hair stylists, fast-food kids and Wal-Mart floor workers, paying them $10 an hour, to pose as bank vice presidents, assistant secretaries and corporate attorneys. These “robosigners” became a national sensation in the fall of 2010 when it was revealed that they faked titles, forged documents and backdated affidavits so they could make up for the bypassed procedures and foreclose on properties. They passed around notary stamps as if they were salt. They did all of this, they testified, without verifying a single word in any of the documents - as is required by law. And it was all done, they say, to foreclose on as many homeowners as fast as possible. No one collects statistics on wrongful foreclosures, or how many people are facing the phantom mortgage debts. But as the industry enters its fifth year of unwinding its mortgage morass, consumer groups, homeowner attorneys and foreclosure-fraud investigators say they are seeing more cases where people who don’t owe the banks a dime are getting ensnared in the same hell as those who have missed payments. They add that such problems are likely to intensify. Former industry employees have testified that they knowingly pushed through foreclosures on the wrong people. It all casts a pall over a housing market in worse condition than it was during the Great Depression. By some estimates, 12.5 percent of U.S. homes with mortgages are either in foreclosure or the loans are at least 30 days past due, representing about $1 trillion in value. “This is an epic problem that the economy hasn’t even begun to digest,” said Florida foreclosure analyst Lisa Epstein. In some cases, mortgages that were supposed to die off in a refinancing are popping back up, while in others, the loans were paid in full. Homeowners who pay off their houses through bankruptcy programs are also falling prey. So are homeowners who never even had a mortgage to begin with. Homeowners say the banks’ repo men sometimes even show up at work. Banks also hector them with threatening letters and phone calls. “It scared the hell out of him,” said a Houston lawyer whose client was the target of such efforts. “He was absolutely spooked,” lawyer Barry Brown said. So was Shantell Curtis of Utah. She showed up at her accountant’s office last year only to learn that she had been sued for foreclosure on a house she had sold years before. Bank of America reported the delinquency to credit bureaus, tarring Curtis’s credit. It turned out the entire saga stemmed from a bank coding error. The amount the bank falsely alleged Curtis still owed on her mortgage? One dollar. Vietnam vet Dwight Gaines fell behind on his payments on his Birmingham, Alabama, home. Gaines paid off his entire mortgage, plus all the fees and expenses he owed the bank in March 2010, as a part of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. But Bank of America kept sending Gaines notices that he still owed $6,842.37. Nearly two years later, Gaines is still fighting the bank in court. “In my experience, if I had not sued Bank of America, they would have eventually placed Mr. Gaines in foreclosure although he had completely paid his mortgage,” said Gaines’ lawyer, Wesley Phillips. Bank of America spokewoman Jumana Bauwens said the bank is working to resolve the Gaines situation. She also said that “these situations pre-date a review of our foreclosure procedures which took place in the fall of 2010. At the time, we identified areas of our process that needed to be improved, and we have been making those improvements.” The reincarnating mortgage is only the latest development in the megabanks’ mortgage debacle, a scandal that has made them the target of a mounting pile of investigations and lawsuits. Though a settlement with most of the U.S. attorneys general may be imminent, a rogue group of AGs has peeled off to launch their own investigations. One of those AGs, New York’s Eric Schneiderman, is a part of the U.S. Justice Department task force announced by President Obama in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night. Up until Obama’s announcement, the federal government’s response to the alleged financial misconduct was in the form of an independent review of the banks overseen by the federal Office of the Comptroller of Currency. But critics have labeled the OCC review as a farce rife with conflicts of interest. The OCC spokesman, Bryan Hubbard, disputed that claim, saying the OCC has gone to great lengths to ensure that the independent consultants hired by the banks to review their procedures would report to regulators, not the banks. “During the selection process of the independent consultants and law firms, regulators rejected some proposed consultants and law firms to prevent conflicts of interest,” said Hubbard. Such reviews are supposed to gather information from homeowners like Jennifer Wilson, a former nursery school teacher from Philadelphia. Wilson settled a wrongful foreclosure case with Wells Fargo in June 2010. That month, court records show, Wells Fargo filed a satisfaction of mortgage document noting that the $8,000 loan on Wilson’s home had been paid in full. But more than a year later, on December 8, 2011, Wilson, who is disabled and lives below the federal poverty line, answered her door to see a process servicer brandishing foreclosure warning papers from Wells Fargo. The bank’s letter warned Wilson that she owed 57 months of late payments, plus expenses, totaling $18,407.55. If she did not pay within 30 days, the bank said, it would sue for foreclosure. “I thought I’d been punked,” said Wilson. Even more bizarrely, one day later, a different process server from a different company showed up on Wilson’s door and handed over the exact same papers Wilson had received the day before. “We see a lot of cases like this, where they are trying to collect even though there is no mortgage,” said Wilson’s lawyer, Jennifer Schultz. “Once the system has marked you as delinquent, there’s just this massive machinery that takes over. There are people whose lives are destroyed by the system, and there’s no way to fix it.” “We are working with her to resolve this matter as quickly as we can,” Wells Fargo spokesman Jim Hines said. Some critics say the stories indicate a pattern of systemic wrongdoing. That is one allegation lobbed in a December lawsuit against the banks brought by Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, who is among the handful of attorneys general that split off from the broader AG settlement group. For the Bowers of Topeka, it all started in July 2009, when they refinanced their home with Wells Fargo. As is standard in a refinance, the couple used the proceeds from their new loan to pay off their old loan, with Security National Mortgage Company. On July 6, 2009, Wells Fargo sent the Bowers a letter with a header in all caps at the top that stated: “CONFIRMATION OF LOAN PAYOFF.” The letter opened by saying: “Congratulations! We are pleased to inform you that we have processed the funds necessary to pay your loan in full.” At the same time, Wells Fargo also sent a certificate of satisfaction to the Bowers local recorder of deeds in Shawnee County, Kansas. That notice certified that the Bowers’ old loan of $184,222.00 had been paid off. As the Bowers had hoped, their interest rate dropped from 7 percent on the old loan to 4.875 percent on the new one. The couple say they paid their new mortgage early each month. But what the Bowers didn’t know is that, five months later, the banks’ private mortgage recording service filed an “Erroneous Release of Mortgage” document on the Bowers’ loan with the Shawnee County Recorder’s Office. The filing stated that the Bowers’ first mortgage “has not been fully paid, nor satisfied, nor discharged, but, instead, continues to exist.” The document was signed by a robosigner, the Bowers’ attorney alleges. One month later, the Bowers noticed that the loan number and interest rate on their mortgage statement had mysteriously changed. Wells Fargo was now charging them the old 7 percent rate - and it hit them with more than $3,000 in late fees. Thus began the family’s descent into their mortgage ordeal. Sheila Bowers says she called Wells Fargo over and over and finally learned that the bank was now alleging that the couple’s refinance never went through, and so the bank was reverting to the terms of the original mortgage. To Wells Fargo, it was as if the refinance had never occurred. Yet Wells Fargo then reported two mortgages to the credit bureaus. That lowered the couple’s credit score to the point where they couldn’t obtain their son’s new student loans. “We only ever got one bill,” said Sheila Bowers. “But they kept telling us we had two mortgages.” The Bowers couldn’t find a lawyer who would take their case, especially since they could pay so little. But through friends, they knew an owner of a Topeka mortgage brokerage company who was also an attorney: Donna Huffman. It turned out Huffman was defending just such cases. “I’m a lender suing lenders,” said Huffman. “I fought to put people in homes, and now I’m fighting to keep them.” Huffman sued, alleging that the bank was making the Bowers pay for its mistake. Wells Fargo response, in court papers, was that the Bowers failed to sign all the paperwork necessary for the refinance to go through. But the Bowers say they signed every document that the bank gave them. The bank also says in court papers that the Bowers never attended a closing. But the Bowers say the bank never told them they needed to do so. What made the story even more strange to the Bowers is that when Sheila Bowers called the Federal Housing Administration to get help, the FHA, in a letter filed in court papers and dated October 19, 2010, told her that the loan Wells Fargo was trying to collect on did not exist. Instead, the FHA said it had documentation showing that the Bowers’ original loan “was terminated on July 1, 2009, by prepayment,” suggesting that Wells Fargo did pay it off. As far as the FHA was concerned, the loan that Wells Fargo was enforcing didn’t exist. Despite the misunderstanding, the Bowers continued to send in their mortgage payment to Wells Fargo, with the amount for the new, refinanced loan, every month. They hoped the entire ordeal would one day get cleared up. But in November 2010, Wells Fargo rejected the Bowers payment and sent it back. The next month, five days before Christmas, the bank foreclosed. The family then stopped sending in payments. They continue to live in limbo in their house as they fight for resolution. Wells Fargo spokesman Jim Hines said: “The allegations, we feel, are baseless. We feel we are entitled to protect our lien interest because the promissory note has never been paid and the note and the (original) mortgage are in default.” To this day, the Bowers say they have no idea where all the mortgage payments they sent in after they got their new loan went. “Nobody seems to know,” said Sheila Bowers. “It’s a mystery.” (Corrects paragraph 10 to $10 an hour instead of $10 per day; corrects last paragraph to Bowers instead of Bowe) ",1262012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-housing-mortgage-reincarnation/old-mortgages-rise-from-the-dead-haunt-homeowners-idUSTRE80P0SJ20120126
331,WFC,B of A loses top spot in U.S. mortgage servicing,"CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) has given up the title of the largest U.S. mortgage servicer, in the latest sign the second-largest U.S. bank is pulling back from the home loan business after its disastrous Countrywide Financial purchase. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) became the top mortgage servicer at the end of 2011, with $1.82 trillion in loans serviced and 17.7 percent market share, according to a report to be released this week by industry newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance. Bank of America, the largest servicer after buying Countrywide in 2008, held $1.77 trillion in mortgage servicing volume, followed by JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the largest U.S. bank, with $1.17 trillion. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has been rocked by loan losses and lawsuits since buying Countrywide, once the nation’s biggest subprime lender. The bank is running off troubled loans and selling off mortgage servicing rights as it looks to boost its capital measures. Bank of America bought Countrywide in 2008 as it verged on bankruptcy amid the subprime lending collapse. The acquisition initially made Bank of America the biggest home lender, but it has been shedding market share as it wrestles with delinquent loans and lawsuits related to mortgage-backed securities. The five largest mortgage servicers, including Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Ally Financial Inc, have been at the center of negotiations with federal officials and state attorneys general to resolve foreclosure-related abuses. States have just a few more days to decide whether to join the settlement, and an announcement of a pact could come as early as next week, people familiar with the talks said. Wells Fargo, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank, widened its lead as the biggest originator of home loans in the fourth quarter of 2011, while Bank of America slipped to fourth in the rankings behind JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc (C.N). San Francisco-based Wells originated 30 percent of all home loans in the last three months of the year, up from 27 percent in the third quarter, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Bank of America slipped to fourth in the rankings from second in the second quarter, as it stopped buying loans from smaller banks. On Wednesday, Citigroup announced it will stop originating loans through mortgage brokers, although it will continue making loans directly to customers. It will also still buy loans from other banks, known as correspondent lending. The bank expects that most of the 300 employees in its broker-related business will find other jobs in the mortgage unit, Citigroup spokesman Mark Rodgers said. In a research report on Wednesday, FBR Capital Markets analyst Paul Miller said Wells Fargo was the only large bank that was still pushing hard to keep a large presence in the mortgage market. The transition in the industry shows that servicing issues and investor claims to buy back soured loans are having an impact on large banks, he wrote. “Capacity to originate loans is being ripped out, and the structure of the industry remains uncertain,” Miller said. Wells Fargo and smaller banks such as Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O) are positioned to take advantage of the exit of other players from the business, he said.

332,WFC,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo family wealth business gets planning head,"* New planning head is based in Winston-Salem * Will focus on traditional wealth planning and family education * Says biggest challenge for rich families is transfer of wealth By Ashley Lau Feb 9 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo has picked Lisa Featherngill to head planning for its Abbot Downing family-wealth business, as the company taps into the market of America’s richest families. “Planning has been an integral part of family wealth since its inception,” Featherngill said in an interview, referring to the firm’s ultra-high-net-worth client base of families with at least $50 million of investable assets. “They’re not concerned about running out of money,” said Featherngill, 52, who joined the company five years ago in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. “They’re concerned about passing on the values of money.” Featherngill, who has been in the industry for 25 years,  will focus on both traditional wealth planning, such as cash flow, investments and wealth transfer, as well as qualitative issues, such as legacy planning, family governance and family wealth education. She will report to Anthony McEahern, head of Wealth Planning at Wells Fargo. Abbot Downing is Wells Fargo’s newly combined family wealth business, made up of the company’s $22.8 billion Family Wealth unit and its $4.7 billion Lowry Hill boutique unit. The integration is expected to be completed by early April. . Featherngill, who most recently was director of wealth planning for Wells’ Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic offices, will remain based in Winston-Salem, the original home of Wachovia headquarters. Featherngill said the bank was a large part of the development of the city and contributed to a lot of the wealth generated by families who did various types of business with Wachovia, which was eventually bought by Wells in 2008. “There’s a lot of wealth that’s multigenerational in Winston-Salem,” where other businesses started by families, such as HanesBrands Inc and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, are also headquartered, Featherngill said. A key challenge this year for ultra-wealthy clients will be planning around proposed changes to U.S. tax exemptions in 2013, Featherngill said. “We’re working in a time where there’s a lot of uncertainty with the tax law,” she said. Gift and estate exemptions are currently $5.12 million per person, with the tax rate on excess at 35 percent. In 2013, the exemption is expected to return to $1 million, with any excess taxed at 55 percent, Featherngill said. “It’s a wonderful opportunity to transfer wealth,” she said. “If you’re looking at a married couple, they could transfer more than $10 million before Dec 31 of this year. When people start thinking about transferring wealth, it really becomes a family wealth business.” Jim Steiner, who heads the new Abbot Downing business, told Reuters in November that there were about 10,000 households in the United States with $50 million or more of investable assets. In an October study of 72 multifamily advising firms, the average client asset size was $48.4 million, according to research and consulting firm Family Wealth Alliance. By the time Abbot Downing finishes its rebranding effort in early April, it will employ about 300 people and have $27.5 billion in client assets. “If they do a nice transition with the brand name, they’ll be known,” said Tom Livergood, founder of Family Wealth Alliance. “It’s kind of an interesting and savvy approach to adopt a new name because it gives them a fresh start and an independent feel.” Abbot Downing is “a natural progression for Wells,” said California-based financial services recruiter Ron Edde of the Armstrong Financial Group. “They have a lot of people who work with ultra-high-net-worth families.”",2092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/onthemove-wellsfargo/update-1-wells-fargo-family-wealth-business-gets-planning-head-idUSL2E8D954520120209

334,WFC,"ON THE MOVE: Wells Fargo hires from MerrillLynch, MSSB","Feb 16 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage unit of Wells Fargo & Company, has hired nine veteran advisers from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Bank of America’s  Merrill Lynch. Together, they managed $970 million in client assets at their previous firms, the company said on Thursday. The advisers, based in California, New York, North Carolina and Maryland, are the latest recruits for Wells, which has now added at least 16 advisers managing about $1.7 billion in client assets since the start of the new year, based on moves tracked by Reuters. “What we’ve experienced is a Midwestern culture that seems to permeate the firm from the top to bottom,” said adviser Tom Bird, who joined Wells last month after roughly three decades with Citi’s Smith Barney, which merged with Morgan Stanley’s wealth management unit in 2009 to form Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. “We sat down with three of the major brokerages, and it was Wells that caught our attention,” Bird told Reuters. “What impressed us was that Wells was willing to allow us to interview every department head that they had,” before making a decision. Bird joined Wells with adviser Kenneth Barkman in Annapolis, Maryland. The two advisers managed $250 million in client assets at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and last year generated $1.6 million in revenue. They now report to market manager Bill Rogers. Also from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, advisers Robert Brien, Michael “Chip” Kazacos, Keith Baier and Christopher LaFountain joined Wells on Monday in Pittsford, New York. The advisers, joining as a team, managed $320 million in client assets at their previous firm and last year generated $3.1 million in revenue. They now report to branch manager Joe Tobin. Brien said in an interview he and his team decided to move to Wells because of the opportunity to expand their business into other parts of the United States. “We tried to expand to different locations over the last year or two,” he said, but noted that at his previous firm there was less room to expand beyond his Rochester, New York base. “We had this vision that we could grow fast if we were in more places,” Brien said. Wells also added three individual advisers in California and North Carolina. Terrance Feeney, a 17-year industry veteran, joined the firm from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in San Rafael, California. He managed $111 million in client assets and last year generated $767,000 in revenue. Also in California, adviser Michael Greer joined Wells from Merrill Lynch, where he managed $183 million in client assets. Greer, an 11-year industry veteran, now works in Wells’ Beverly Hills office and reports to branch manager Prateek Amar. In North Carolina, adviser Ronald Winski joined Wells’ Charlotte office from Merrill Lynch, where he managed $106 million in client assets. He last year generated $530,000 in revenue and now reports to market manager Joel Glasco. Wells, the third largest U.S. brokerage, has just over 15,000 advisers and about $1.1 trillion in client assets, based on the last available data from September. The firm said on Thursday it also hired former Raymond James manager Tim Sheridan in New York. Sheridan, who now manages Wells’ Park Avenue office, oversees 19 financial advisers with a combined production of about $24 million.

336,WFC,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo buys BNP Paribas energy lending unit,"By Rick Rothacker FEB 21 - Wells Fargo & Co said it is buying an energy lending business from BNP Paribas in the U.S. bank’s latest acquisition from a European bank seeking to shrink its balance sheet. The San Francisco-based bank is buying $9.5 billion of total loan commitments, including $3.9 billion in funded balances. BNP said the premium paid by Wells and other terms of the all-cash transaction were not being disclosed. BNP said the sale of the Houston-based business was part of its plan to reduce its U.S. dollar funding requirements and would provide a slight benefit to its Tier 1 Common Equity ratio. The company said it remains committed to maintaining a strong North American energy and commodities business. About 90 percent of the portfolio is U.S.-based, with the rest mostly in Canada, Wells said. Reuters reported in January that France’s largest listed bank was shopping a portfolio of loans to oil and gas companies and had received interest from Wells Fargo and Canadian buyers. European banks have been retreating from the United States as they look to offload assets and build capital amid the Euro zone debt crisis. The deal, subject to regulatory and other approvals, is expected to close in the second quarter. The group’s 36 employees in Houston and Calgary will be offered jobs with Wells, BNP said. Since the middle of last year, Wells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. bank by assets, has bought commercial real estate loans from Irish banks and acquired Bank of Ireland’s Burdale Financial Holdings Ltd unit, an asset-based lender.

In Illinois, advisers Jeffrey Grange and Jeffrey Hollis joined Morgan Stanley Smith Barney’s Lisle office from Merrill Lynch, the brokerage unit now owned by Bank of America. Grange and Hollis, who had both been with Merrill for more than a decade, managed $227 million in client assets at the firm. They last year generated $1.2 million in revenue. The two advisers now report to complex manager Timothy Byrnes, who oversees advisers in the western Chicago and central Illinois region. In Pennsylvania, adviser Brad Rude joined Morgan Stanley Smith Barney’s Blue Bell office from Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage division of Wells Fargo & Company. Rude managed $129 million in client assets at his previous firm and last year generated $1.5 million in revenue. He now reports to branch manager Steve Brettler. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, which resulted from the merger of Morgan Stanley’s wealth management unit and Citigroup’s Smith Barney in 2009, now has just over 17,000 advisers across the United States. The firm has total client assets of about $1.6 trillion, making it the largest U.S. brokerage, followed by Merrill and Wells. With these latest adviser additions, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney has now added at least 20 brokers from competing firms since the start of the new year, based on moves tracked by Reuters. On the flip side, the firm has lost at least 34 brokers over that same period. Based on client assets previously managed by those advisers joining and leaving, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney has gained roughly the same amount of client assets by advisers joining, roughly $2.5 billion, as it has lost by advisers leaving, roughly $2.4 billion.",2232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/morganstanley/on-the-move-morgan-stanley-adds-ex-merrill-wells-fargo-advisers-idUSL2E8DNDRB20120223
341,WFC,REFILE-Natixis says to reduce commodities market business,"* Commodities financing business to be kept * Possible bidders - VTB, China Construction, Wells Fargo * LME stake and ring-dealing membership seen valuable By Christian Plumb and Eric Onstad PARIS/LONDON, Feb 23 (Reuters) - French investment bank Natixis plans to “significantly reduce” its commodities market activities, its chief executive said on Thursday, as it scales back exposure to less profitable activities. Natixis said in January in an internal presentation that it had received and was studying expressions of interest for its commodities unit, and the comments by Chief Executive Laurent Mignon are a sign that it may still be in play. “I don’t comment on market rumours, but it’s clear that we’ll significantly reduce our activities on the commodities market,” Mignon told journalists in a conference call focused on results. Natixis is one of several French banks that have been scaling back their commodities presence after dollar financing evaporated amid rising anxiety about the euro zone debt crisis. Mignon, reiterating earlier statements in the internal document obtained by Reuters, described the commodities financing business as “extremely profitable and successful” and said would be spared. “But in terms of hedging and the commodities market, we have too weak a critical mass to be profitable,” he said. The bank’s Commodity Markets unit - the main candidate for sale - offers derivatives on a range of metals, fuels and commodities as well as currencies, while a separate unit within its Structured Finance business offers commodities trade finance. Potential bidders for Commodity Markets include Russia’s VTB , China Construction Bank and Wells Fargo & Co, market sources have said. One high-level metals trading source with knowledge of Chinese banks questioned whether a unit of a European bank would be a good fit for a Chinese bank due to different regional attitudes toward risk. On the other hand, China Construction was more Western-oriented than some others, the source said. RING-DEALING “All the Chinese banks are trying to get into commodities, but Construction Bank is one of the ones more open to getting into the worldwide markets ... For Construction Bank, that (buying the Natixis commodity unit) would fast-track it to the same level as Bank of China,” the source said. Bank of China International is ahead of its peers in building up a commodities trading business and is due to join the London Metal Exchange (LME) in the coming months. The source said Natixis may be hoping for rich proceeds after the sale of MF Global’s membership in LME ring-dealing - or open outcry trading - and its LME shares attracted strong interest late last year. JPMorgan paid 25 million pounds ($39 million) for MF Global’s LME stake of 4.7 percent, sources familiar with the situation said. Natixis has a category 1 ring-dealing membership and 250,000 ordinary LME shares, which alone are worth 10.4 million pounds, based on the price JPMorgan paid. “I guess for the ring members, they’ve suddenly got an idea that they’ve got a potential windfall on their hands if they could offload a ring 1 brokerage,” the same source said. “I just don’t know how many people are queuing up to get involved, especially not knowing whether the floor will still exist if the sale (of the LME) goes through.” Since commodities is a dollar-based business, it would be no surprise to see a U.S. bidder such as Wells Fargo interested in Natixis, industry sources said. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf has said the bank is actively exploring possible acquisitions as European banks look to shed loans and businesses. On Tuesday, Wells Fargo said it was buying an energy lending business from BNP Paribas. BNP, the largest French bank, shut its Houston commodities office in November. Among other Natixis rivals, Credit Agricole has said it plans to pull out of commodities trading, but like Natixis it expects to keep its presence in commodities trade financing. Societe Generale in December moved to quit the North American physical power and gas markets.

Britain’s two part-nationalised banks, Lloyds and RBS, plan to tap the European Central Bank’s special three-year funding scheme for a combined amount of about 15 billion euros ($20.19 billion), on a par with some of the euro zone’s largest banks. Wells Fargo plans to increase the size of its wealth management and insurance divisions through acquisitions as well as buying more assets from shrinking European banks, its chief executive says. Finance ministers from the world’s largest economies ratcheted up the pressure on Germany to increase the size of the euro zone’s 500 billion euros ($673.15 billion) rescue fund, saying the move would be “essential” to a decision by non-European countries to raise more resources for the International Monetary Fund.

347,WFC,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo may face charges over mortgage bonds - filing,"* Bank discloses “Wells notice” from SEC staff * Investigation focused on disclosures in offering documents * Latest sign of intensifying government scrutiny By Rick Rothacker Feb 28 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co could face a federal enforcement action related to disclosures it made in offering documents for mortgage-backed securities, the bank said in a securities filing Tuesday. The disclosure is the latest sign that government officials are stepping up action against banks that packaged home loans into bonds during the housing boom. The underlying mortgages later soured, spurring billions in losses for investors. Wells Fargo said it received a so-called Wells notice from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, an indication the agency plans to bring charges. Spokespersons for Wells Fargo and the SEC declined comment. Last month, the Obama administration set up a special task force to investigate practices related to mortgage-backed securities. A settlement this month with five major banks, including Wells Fargo, over foreclosure-related abuses allows probes of mortgage bonds to go forward. In Tuesday’s filing, Wells, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, said it also faces investigations related to home loan origination practices. The bank said it continues to provide information requested by various agencies in certain investigations. San Francisco-based Wells is the largest originator of mortgages in the United States. Last week, Citigroup Inc said it received a subpoena from federal and state regulators seeking information about the bank’s “issuing, sponsoring, or underwriting” of mortgage-backed securities. The inquiries included a subpoena from the civil division of the U.S. Department of Justice, which Citigroup received on Jan. 27, it said in its annual report. That same day Attorney General Eric Holder said the department had issued civil subpoenas to 11 financial institutions as part of a new effort to investigate misconduct in the packaging and sale of home loans to investors. In its annual report filing last week, Bank of America Corp  said it has “received a number of subpoenas” from regulators and other authorities about the bank’s underwriting and issuance of mortgage-backed securities.",2282012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo/update-1-wells-fargo-may-face-charges-over-mortgage-bonds-filing-idUSL2E8DSBIS20120228

350,WFC,Wells Fargo to offer mobile app for brokers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Company will offer a new mobile application for its brokers in 2012 to address a growing need for new adviser tools in digital media. Advisers regularly seek better ways to serve their clients, and increasingly that means mobile apps, said Wells Fargo’s Joe Nadreau, who manages strategic solutions for the company’s brokerage business. “We’re trying to optimize more for Wells advisers,” Nadreau told Thomson Reuters’ 2012 Online Financial Services Symposium on Wednesday. “We really have to separate into client versus adviser oriented - those two worlds are very different.” Wells Fargo already has a general corporate application for mobile devices. A panel of wealth management professionals from firms including Charles Schwab, Bank of America and Wells spoke at the symposium about the growing importance of using mobile applications to conduct business in real time. The panelists agreed that the industry is increasingly relying on mobile technology, but a big question is how much to invest in developing those mobile platforms. Charles Schwab’s approach is to start with the core needs of brokers and clients, and create applications for those services before developing additional add-on functions. “Really nail those, and then start to look at the others around them,” said Kate O’Connor, media supervisor at Charles Schwab. O’Connor said Schwab is consolidating its mobile and web teams because the company views digital mobility more as a platform than a separate channel. As advisers turn to mobile applications, they also must tread cautiously, as the challenges of protecting security and privacy remain. While there is often no direct risk to using the mobile applications themselves, there is the danger of misplacing a device containing confidential information. “If you leave it (a mobile device) in a cab, now someone can have access” to confidential company information, said Paul Vienick, who heads Merrill Edge Self-Directed Investing & Merrilledge.com, a unit of Bank of America. The situation can be even more serious for advisers, who could have reams of contacts and private client data on their mobile devices. To mitigate some of those issues, Wells has a remote-swiping capability that allows the company to clean a device remotely if an employee reports it stolen. Still, the industry is “well-positioned” to help educate consumers about risks they can encounter, said Mike Ellison, president of Corporate Insight, a strategic marketing and consulting firm for the financial services industry.

The disclosures are the latest sign government officials are stepping up action against banks that packaged home loans into bonds during the housing boom.

Goldman and Wells Fargo both said they received so-called “Wells notices” from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Goldman received its Wells notice on Feb. 24, relating to a $1.3 billion subprime mortgage-backed securities deal in late 2006 that the bank underwrote. Goldman said it will be making a submission to the SEC related to the case and communicating with SEC staff to address their concerns. The bank has also received inquiries from governmental, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory entities concerning certain transactions Goldman entered with MF Global Holdings Ltd  prior to the brokerage firm’s bankruptcy filing. Goldman said it is cooperating with all such inquiries. Reuters earlier reported that Goldman purchased $1.3 billion worth of commercial paper from MF Global days before its bankruptcy on Oct. 31. Wells Fargo said its Wells notice related to its disclosures in offering documents for mortgage-backed securities. The bank said it is providing information requested by various regulatory agencies in connection with their investigations. Representatives of Goldman, Wells Fargo and the SEC declined further comment. The U.S. government is under intense pressure to show that it can hold Wall Street accountable for its contribution to the subprime housing meltdown that began in 2007. Last month, the Obama administration set up a special task force to investigate practices related to mortgage-backed securities. A settlement this month with five major banks, including Wells Fargo, over foreclosure-related abuses allows probes of mortgage bonds to go forward. Several banks, including Goldman and Wells Fargo, have already reached multi-million-dollar settlements with the SEC over crisis-era derivatives deals tied to subprime mortgages. The Wells notices detailed on Tuesday indicate the SEC is pursuing cases related to securitization of the underlying bonds as well. In January, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the Justice Department issued civil subpoenas focusing on mortgage-backed securities to 11 different financial institutions. He said the department had discussed the subpoenas with the SEC and added these subpoenas did not duplicate earlier requests from that agency.

364,WFC,"Wells Fargo eyes ""selective acquisitions"": CFO","(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) can continue to grow through “selective acquisitions” as European banks shed loans and business units, the bank’s chief financial officer said on Wednesday. In 2011, the fourth-largest U.S. bank bought $3 billion in U.S. commercial loans from Irish banks and purchased asset-based lender Burdale Capital Finance Inc. Last month, it agreed to buy BNP Paribas SA’s (BNPP.PA) energy lending business in a deal that is expected to close in the second quarter. The San Francisco-based bank has capitalized on opportunities to buy loans and businesses from European banks forced to met higher capital requirements. “We haven’t seen any reduction in the rate at which acquisition opportunities are occurring out there,” Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said at an investor conference in New York. Wells Fargo, with sufficient capital and liquidity, has been in a position to make these purchases while some of its U.S. competitors have “different challenges,” Sloan said. “It’s this part of the cycle where you see good opportunities,” he said. In addition to making money from interest payments on acquired loans, the purchases also give Wells Fargo an entree to new customers to whom it can try to sell other products and services, he said. Wells Fargo also expects to make more loans to new and existing customers, Sloan said. The bank’s total loans outstanding increased by $9.5 billion to $769.6 billion in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter. The majority of the growth — $5.6 billion — came from lending to businesses, a trend experienced at other banks in the fourth quarter. “We expect loan growth to continue,” Sloan said.

367,WFC,Wells Fargo ends free checking in 6 more states,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co is ending free checking in six more states, expanding a $7-per-month account charge that went into effect in other parts of the country last year. Existing customers in Georgia, New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania will be required to pay the monthly fee for the “Essential” checking account, unless they keep a $1,500 minimum daily balance or make direct deposits of $500 each month, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said Thursday. After converting existing accounts in 24 Western states last year, the San Francisco-based bank is working on accounts in Eastern states, where it gained its first branches through its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia Corp. Accounts in its remaining East coast states will eventually be converted, spokeswoman Richele Messick said. Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, began notifying customers in the six states of the change this week. The fee will appear in June bank statements. Customers can get a $2 discount by eschewing paper statements. In recent years, banks have been doing away with free checking accounts as new regulations curb fees on overdrafts and other charges. Banks typically charge customers monthly fees, unless they choose to do more business with the bank. Wells Fargo ended free checking for new customers in July 2010. It expects 80 percent of its customers to waive monthly maintenance fees by keeping minimum balances and taking other actions. The Essential account is not available to new customers, who must pay $5 per month for a basic account, unless they keep a $1,500 minimum daily balance or have a direct monthly deposit of at least $250 in one lump sum. This year, Wells Fargo also eliminated one of the ways customers could avoid monthly maintenance fees on its premium $10- and $15-per month accounts. Customers can no longer waive this fee by setting up a monthly automatic transfer to a savings account. Messick, the Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said the bank wants customers to contact it. “We can talk to them about their needs and make sure they are in the right accounts,” she said.

369,WFC,Fed stress tests an investor payday for some,"(Reuters) - Most U.S. banks and their investors responded jubilantly to the Federal Reserve’s release of stress test results on Tuesday, with some announcing plans to raise dividends and spend billions of dollars on share buybacks. The Fed gave passing grades to 15 out of 19 banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co. Among the losers: Citigroup Inc, the nation’s number-three bank, and MetLife Inc, the nation’s largest life insurer. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank and arguably one of the strongest, kicked off the releases by announcing that it had been cleared to raise its dividend by 20 percent and spend as much as $12 billion buying back stock this year and $3 billion more in the first three months of 2013. The announcement, which came 90 minutes before the Fed released the results of the other banks, sent JPMorgan and other bank shares soaring. The KBW Bank Index of large-cap financial stocks, which includes most of the banks taking the stress test, rose 4.6 percent before the market closed, having already gained 15.2 percent this year as of Monday’s close. Banks that did not get the rulings they wanted saw their shares fall after the market closed. Citigroup, for example, lost 3.5 percent in after-hours trading. Because the Federal Reserve had previously said it would announce results on Thursday, it looked as though JPMorgan may have jumped the gun with its announcement. A senior Fed official said the central bank became concerned Monday night that some information may have inadvertently been released. The official also said there was a miscommunication with JPMorgan and that nobody at the company was at fault. A person close to the situation who has not been authorized to speak publicly said leaks about the tests on Monday night prompted the Fed to move up the release to Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT). Then, around noon on Tuesday, there was miscommunication between JPMorgan and the Fed about the hour when JPMorgan would release its statement, the person said. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in JPMorgan’s announcement, “We are pleased to be in a position to increase our dividend and to establish a new equity repurchase program. We expect to generate significant capital and deploy that capital to the benefit of our shareholders.” In contrast, State Street Corp said only that the Fed had not objected to its capital plans and that it would “provide further detail in the morning.” Bank of America, which had said it had not asked for permission to raise its dividend or buy back shares, declined to comment on its results even though it passed the test. Citigroup, which only just missed a passing mark, did not dispute the Fed’s decision and said it would submit a revised proposal later this year. Some analysts had expected Citigroup to win permission to raise its dividend to as much as 10 cents from a penny a share. Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit lamented recently in the company’s annual report that “some of our peers were buoyed by the ability to buy back shares, an option we lacked.” Citigroup investor and hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson said he was surprised that Citi didn’t make the hurdle. “They missed very narrowly, in an extreme stress scenario,” said Tilson. Wells Fargo said it increased its quarterly dividend to 22 cents from 12 cents. The bank also said the Fed approved its capital plan, which includes a higher level of share repurchases in 2012 than in 2011, when it bought back 117 million shares. “Wells Fargo has always managed its business to perform for shareholders through a variety of economic environments and we are pleased that this process again validates the strength of our franchise,” CEO John Stumpf said in written announcement. MetLife said it was “deeply disappointed” with the Fed’s testing, which it said was not suited to an insurance company. Though MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States, its small online deposit-taking operation means it is regulated as a bank holding company. The Fed objected to MetLife’s incremental capital distribution plan, which included an increase of the company’s annual stock dividend from $0.74 per share to $1.10 per share, plus $2 billion in stock repurchases. MetLife has said it expected to return capital to shareholders this year, but it purposely left any buybacks out of its 2012 guidance. MetLife stock fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trading. Ally Financial, whose common capital score fared the worst of all 19 banks under the Fed’s worst-case scenario, issued a statement criticizing the stress test assumptions. The Detroit-based lender said the Fed’s analysis “dramatically overstates” mortgage risk, particularly for newer loans, and does not reflect management’s ability to deal with risks related to problem loans originated before the financial crisis. The bank also said that the Fed did not give enough weight to additional capital that Ally could use in a stress situation if the Fed allowed it to do so. Ally said it plans to submit a revised capital plan in the near future. SunTrust, the last of the four banks with a capital plan that failed the test, took several hours to issue a statement, during which its shares fell as much as 5.3 percent in extended trading. SunTrust said its own models were “significantly more favorable” than the Fed’s, and that it expected to beat earnings estimates for the current quarter. Morgan Stanley released a statement more than an hour after JPMorgan, but 17 minutes ahead of the Federal Reserve, saying the regulator had no objection to its 2012 capital plan. That plan includes keeping stable its common and preferred dividend payouts, and potentially using cash to buy another 14 percent stake of its Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture with Citigroup. Morgan Stanley has the option to buy that stake in May. Goldman Sachs Group Inc, in a statement after the Fed announcement, said the regulator did not object to its capital plan through the first quarter of 2013. The plan includes stock repurchases and a potential increase to its quarterly common stock dividend, which is currently 35 cents per share. Last year, Goldman spent $6 billion buying back 47 million shares, which is its preferred way of returning capital to shareholders. Management is currently authorized to buy back another 63.5 million shares. Fifth Third Bancorp, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, said the Fed objected to its bid to raise its quarterly dividend and spend more for share buybacks than it receives in gains from a potential asset sale. The bank said it will resubmit its plan to the Fed in order to address the regulator’s objections. BB&T; Corp bumped its quarterly dividend by 4 cents to 20 cents per share, and said it received permission to redeem $3.2 billion in trust preferred securities. “We continue to be one of the strongest capitalized institutions in the industry and believe our 2012 capital actions confirm that strength and our commitment to our shareholders,” CEO Kelly King said. PNC Financial Services Group Inc said it received permission to increase its 35-cents-per share quarterly dividend but did not say by how much. Its board is expected to consider an increase in April. The bank also plans modest share repurchases. US Bancorp increased its quarterly dividend by 7 cents to 19.5 cents and its board authorized the repurchase of 100 million of its outstanding shares. “Looking ahead, we continue to see a slow, but steady, economic recovery, and we look forward to participating in the revitalization of our markets, while serving the needs of our customers and, importantly, rewarding our shareholders for their investment in our company,” CEO Richard Davis said. Bank of New York Mellon Corp said the Fed cleared its plan to repurchase $1.16 billion of stock over the next 12 months and maintain its current dividend. Unlike banks eager to pay fatter dividends, Regions Financial Corp said it had launched a $900 million common stock offering as part of a plan to repay $3.5 billion in government bailout dollars. The Alabama-based regional bank said the payback would come after it completes the sale of its Morgan Keegan brokerage unit, pending Federal Reserve and Treasury approval. “We are pleased with the outcome of the capital plan review and believe it demonstrates the strength of our company,” said Regions CEO Grayson Hall. KeyCorp said it would raise its quarterly common stock dividend to 5 cents per share from the current level of 3 cents per share, and begin a $344 million stock buyback program. The Fed did not object to those plans or the possible redemption of certain trust preferred securities, KeyCorp said. American Express Co said it plans to repurchase up to $5 billion worth of stock from now through the first quarter of 2013, and raise its quarterly dividend to 20 cents per share from the current level of 18 cents per share. The Fed did not object to those plans, AmEx said. ",3142012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-jpmorgan-dividend/fed-stress-tests-an-investor-payday-for-some-idUSBRE82C16B20120314

Stumpf’s stock award increased by about $1 million to $12 million from 2010, while his salary and bonus dipped. The stock award is in the form of performance shares, which vest in 2014 only if the company meets a certain return on capital measures. The San Francisco-based bank completed last year the conversion of East Coast Wachovia branches to the Wells Fargo name and systems, while posting record net income for common stockholders of $15 billion. The bank’s shares slumped 11 percent during the year, better than a 25 percent decline in the KBW Bank Index. Wells is the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, but has the largest market value. The bank’s second-highest paid employees was Mark Oman, who retired as head of home and consumer finance in December. His total compensation was $16.4 million, which included $7.9 million for the change in his pension value and deferred compensation earnings. The bank attributed the jump in his pension value to the way it calculated his retirement age under Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines. Oman’s overall retirement benefit was $12.2 million, according to the filing. Under Oman, Wells Fargo became the biggest originator of home loans and, by the end of last year, also the biggest servicer. The bank avoided some of the missteps made by other lenders in the housing boom, but was also one of five lenders to agree to a $25 billion settlement this year over foreclosure abuses. The bank’s annual proxy filing outlined four shareholder proposals that will be voted on at the April 24 annual stockholder meeting, including one that would require an independent board chairman. Stumpf is currently the chairman as well as the CEO and president. The board opposes the proposal, according to the proxy, noting the company already has an independent lead director. Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc remains the bank’s largest shareholder with a 7.7 percent stake, up from 7 percent a year ago. Investment firm BlackRock Inc held the second largest stake at 5.1 percent. It was not listed in last year’s proxy.",3152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-pay/update-1-wells-fargo-ceos-compensation-rises-5-percent-idUSL2E8EFAZS20120315
372,WFC,"RPT-U.S. banks hike fees, cut costs to boost profits","* Public outcries block broad new checking account fees * Wells Fargo tests account packages * JPMorgan tries airport-style kiosks to cut costs * Deposits worth less to banks with low loan rates By David Henry and Rick Rothacker March 15 (Reuters) - Jack up checking fees for bank customers who don’t use direct deposit regularly. Replace tellers with self-service, touch-screen kiosks. Install new chairs and conference rooms to court well-to-do customers. U.S. bank executives are handing down such orders to replace profits lost to recent regulatory reforms and low interest rates. They hope these tactics will be more successful than Bank of America Corp’s plan last fall to charge a $5 monthly fee for debit cards. The bank had to retreat amid howls of protest. Having mostly stopped the losses from the financial crisis, banks are focused on lifting profits from levels below their own historic averages and those of many other industries. Wells Fargo & Co, for example, has new account requirements that push customers to do more financial business with the company. Bank of America is testing new prices for basic services in three states. JPMorgan Chase & Co is installing digital tablets and advanced ATMs to reduce the need for tellers and nearly one billion pieces of paper a year. These three banks hold one-third of U.S. consumer deposits, and their price hikes, cost cuts and marketing to the rich are likely to influence the way Americans bank for years to come. Increasingly, customers entering branches will be steered toward machines, much like airport ticket counters. More meetings with loan officers will take place by video conference. And nearly everyone, experts say, will need to be wary of new fees and pricing schemes. Some customers are upset. Laurie Wittges of San Jose, California, said she is struggling to pay higher monthly charges from Wells Fargo. Unemployed, she can’t maintain the balance of about $2,500 that the bank now requires to waive her fees. “There are a bunch of people like me who can’t afford this,” said Wittges, 50. She lost a job as an executive assistant when the company where she worked closed last year. As happens every decade or so, banks are intensifying efforts to increase pricing power, attract high net-worth customers and apply money-saving technology. While banks no longer lose money as they did in 2009, their stocks remain under pressure and executives are eager to raise profits. Bank profits are simply too thin now to attract investors, said industry consultant Bert Ely. Return on equity, a key measure of profitability, in 2011 was 7.86 percent, which is below the 28-year average of nearly 10 percent and perhaps two-thirds as much as banks need to compete with other industries for capital, Ely said. The outlook for the next few years is discouraging. One-time accounting adjustments boosted banks’ 2011 results, and will need to be replaced for banks to increase earnings in 2012. Regulators are on course to tighten limits on how much banks borrow to leverage up profits. And while bank stocks have rallied in the past six months, they are not hitting new peaks. The KBW Bank Index of stocks is no higher now than in August 2009 even though the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index is up more than 30 percent. The Dodd-Frank Act, the law designed to address causes of the financial crisis, has curbed banks to the extent that there are fewer customers who bring enough revenue to cover the cost of serving them. Banks are barred from charging as much in overdraft fees as before, and from collecting from merchants all the money they used to get for debit-card transactions. Revenue from lending out customer deposits is down because of lower interest rates and loan demand. Some executives regret marketing free checking accounts in the past. “As an industry, we have communicated with a generation of customers that this is all free, and there are costs,” Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf lamented at an investment conference in December. The average cost to provide a checking account through a bank branch, according to Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, is roughly $300 a year, including spending to open branches, build computer systems, create websites and operate call centers. On that basis, about half of all U.S. households are unprofitable to the banks, according to JPMorgan. Even when customers leave thousands of dollars on deposit in accounts, banks often do not make enough money on the funds to cover the costs. For example, an account with $4,000 that JPMorgan could have invested last year would have generated only about $140 in interest revenue for the bank. That’s based on the 3.51 percent average rate the bank received on interest-earning assets and does not factor in its cost to make loans. To be sure, banks are not going to dump half of their accounts. Serving additional customers does not cost much once banks have set up operations. Incremental costs for things like checks, debit cards and additional deposit insurance are so slight that they are covered by about 90 percent of accounts, according to JPMorgan. The banks also know that once interest rates rise and loan demand returns they will make money on the marginal accounts. But banks are making a shift. Across all banks, 45 percent of non-interest checking accounts are now free, down from 65 percent in 2010, according to a Bankrate.com study released in September. Banks are searching for an extra $5 here and $10 there. Bank of America, for example, since last year has been testing a menu of account choices in Massachusetts, Georgia and Arizona. The accounts, for new consumers, cost $6 to $25 per month. Most of the accounts provide ways to escape the fees, but customers must keep a minimum balance or use a credit card. Wells Fargo eliminated free checking for new customers in 2010 and is gradually ending it for existing customers. In early March, the bank said it will charge current customers in six East Coast states $7 per month, unless they keep a $1,500 minimum daily balance or make direct deposits of $500 each month. The bank has already made the change in 24 western states. Wells Fargo CEO Stumpf also aims to convince customers to do more business with the bank, like take out loans and use investment services, to pay their way. “We can give them package pricing,” Stumpf told investors. “It is a better deal for them.” To cut costs, Bank of America is closing branches. Wells Fargo said it may shrink branches and reduce the number of tellers. JPMorgan is installing new technology in branches to cut expenses and, executives hope, attract profitable customers. “We’ll have more room for self-service, more room for rich people and business customers,” Todd Maclin, JPMorgan’s consumer banking chief, said at an investor conference last month. The bank plans to coach customers in online and mobile banking, he said. Advanced ATMs will cash checks and dispense currency in multiple denominations, reducing the need for human tellers. In six branches where JPMorgan is testing self-service kiosks, check cashing with tellers declined 40 percent. “Paperless tellers,” people equipped with computer tablet touch screens, saved time and reduced errors in five branches where they are being tested, the bank said. JPMorgan expects to use video conferencing to allow foreign language speakers and investment and loan experts to talk with customers in multiple locations. Some 58 branches now have machines that issue debit cards on the spot to save postage and time. The machines will soon spit out credit cards, too. Still, new equipment and mobile banking apps can only do so much. About 90 percent of retail transactions with the bank are already automated, Maclin said. While the remaining 10 percent of transactions tend to have especially high costs that can be reduced, the estimated $500 million in annual savings falls short of the $800 million JPMorgan said it is losing to new regulations on consumer accounts and debit cards. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said in an interview that what is different for banks from past profit squeezes is that there are more ways to provide cost-effective services to customers, such as mobile banking. That may be, but banks have failed with some technology investments in the past. In the late 1990s, First Union Corp, a North Carolina-based regional bank, flopped with a strategy called “Future Bank” intended to push customers away from tellers to phones, ATMs and computers. Customers grumbled about long waiting lines for tellers and in-branch phones that connected them to distant call centers. First Union lost deposits and had to rehire tellers. Maclin of JPMorgan Chase vowed his bank will be careful as it pushes ahead. “We’re not going to torture people in the process of getting them to go to self-service,” he said.",3152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/banks-fees/rpt-u-s-banks-hike-fees-cut-costs-to-boost-profits-idUSL2E8EFAWC20120315

375,WFC,SEC takes Wells Fargo to court to enforce subpoenas,"(Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators accused Wells Fargo & Co on Friday of repeatedly ignoring its subpoenas for documents in connection with a probe into the bank’s $60 billion sale of mortgage-backed securities. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s filing in a San Francisco federal court seeks to compel the fourth largest U.S. bank to hand over documents. The SEC said it has issued several subpoenas since September. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman called the SEC’s action “inappropriate” and pledged the bank would “vigorously defend itself in court” against the SEC action. “Wells Fargo has extensively cooperated in the commission’s investigation and believed it had an understanding with the SEC staff with regard to the outstanding document requests; the filing of this action violates that understanding,” said Wells Fargo spokeswoman Mary Eshet. The SEC said on Friday it is looking into whether Wells Fargo made “material misrepresentations or omitted material facts” in offerings it made to investors from September 2006 through early 2008, a period that included the beginnings of the financial crisis. The SEC charges that a due diligence review of a sampling of the securitized loans was done, and some of those loans would be dropped because they failed to meet the bank’s underwriting standards. But the regulator said it “does not appear that Wells Fargo took any steps to address similar deficiencies in the remainder of the loans in the pool, which were securitized and sold to investors.” Eshet said that the SEC had inaccurately described its conduct with regard to residential mortgage backed securities and that no enforcement action was warranted. Several major US banks, including Bank of America Corp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc have faced intense scrutiny from regulators, investors and politicians over their packaging and marketing of mortgage debt, including whether they properly disclosed the risks. Much of that debt proved riskier than expected, and was a major factor in both the 2008 financial crisis and the roughly five-year U.S. housing slump. The SEC’s subpoena enforcement action against Wells Fargo is a rather unusual legal maneuver. One of the last more high-profile instances of the SEC seeking compliance with a subpoena occurred in September when it asked a federal court to compel a unit of accounting giant Deloitte & Touche to produce records in connection with a fraud probe at China-based Longtop Financial Technologies Ltd. According to the SEC’s Friday filing against Wells Fargo, the agency has issued six subpoenas to Wells Fargo since September 30. The SEC said in its complaint it wants the bank to provide the documents in 14 days. In the complaint, the SEC said on February 24 the commission staff notified Wells Fargo that it was considering filing a civil suit for securities law violations. The banks disclosed the notice in its February 28 annual report. According to an email included in the court filings, a lawyer representing Wells Fargo on March 14 told an SEC attorney that the bank assumed the investigation was over after it received the enforcement notice. The bank could revisit the issue of any additional document production after filing its response to the notice, the lawyer wrote. Among the types of documents the SEC is seeking are loan underwriting guidelines, due diligence reports, drafts of prospectus supplements, staff training materials, preliminary loan data and 1,365 emails. The SEC said that Wells Fargo had initially balked at turning over the emails based on attorney-client privilege, but then later reversed course and promised to turn them over in short order. In some cases, the SEC said the bank has provided regulators certain documents, but has still failed to confirm it produced all of them. In other cases, such as with the emails, the SEC contends it has still not received them. Most recently, the SEC said, Wells Fargo “failed to complete its production of responsive documents” despite setting a self-imposed deadline of March 7. The agency also disclosed that it has separately sent notices to two individuals involved with Wells Fargo’s mortgage-backed securities offerings warning it may bring enforcement actions against them.

Edwards & Sons, said on Monday it added three former Wells Fargo advisers in Ohio, opening its second branch in the state. Daniel LaMacchia, Paul Kosling and Sherry Daniels joined Benjamin Edwards on Friday in Columbus, where they opened a new office. LaMacchia, a nearly three-decade industry veteran, joined the firm as vice president of investments. In a separate hire, Benjamin Edwards added adviser David Claggett, also formerly with Wells Fargo, to its LaSalle-Peru, Illinois office. A more than 20-year industry veteran, Claggett has joined three other advisers at the LaSalle-Peru office and is now a vice president of investments. Since its founding, Benjamin Edwards has grown its adviser base by hiring dozens of legacy A.G. Edwards advisers from Wells Fargo. So far in 2012, the firm has added 12 advisers from Wells in Florida, Illinois, New Jersey and Ohio. A.G. Edwards & Sons was acquired in 2007 by Wachovia, which one year later was acquired by Wells Fargo. Many legacy A.G. Edwards advisers stayed with the brokerage through the acquisitions. Benjamin Edwards now has 23 offices in 14 states.

379,WFC,Banks find opportunity in Postal Service woes,"(Reuters) - The bank industry, struggling to make the profits it used to, is using the struggles of another industry for its marketing: The Postal Service. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) are all using the looming threat of postal service cuts to sell bank services such as electronic payments and remittance pickups that can speed payments likely to be slowed by diminished mail service. “It is a conversation starter,” said Daniel Peltz, head of Wells Fargo’s Treasury Management division. For banks, electronic transactions save as much as one-third of the cost of processing checks, according to industry estimates. The potential savings are greatest for bigger banks, which reap additional economies of scale by running more transactions through the computer systems they have built. Banks are looking for any chance to save money these days, as tough markets and a weak economy hit their profits, and traditional revenue streams dry up due to stricter regulations. For bank customers, the new electronic payments and other services offer savings, too. Greg Kerwick, a managing director in JPMorgan’s Treasury Services unit, said his team is telling customers they might have to wait one to four days longer for invoices to reach customers and payments to return by mail, if Saturday postal delivery is eliminated. His division, which helps 25,000 businesses with cash management, estimates that waiting an extra two days for payment would require a company that receives $5 billion of mail payments a year to come up with an extra $27 million of working capital. To save that money, of course, customers must pay. For example, using lockbox services - where the bank picks up checks for businesses from postal plants seven days a week - can mean as much as $2 per check for the bank, which also can earn interest income during the maximum of three to four days they hold a payer’s money before some checks are cleared, said Nancy Atkinson, a senior analyst with consulting firm Aite Group. This “float period” could become even more valuable as interest rates rise in the future, she said. Banks, however, may find it challenging to win more payment business because a delay in mail service is advantageous to bill payers who want to hold onto their funds as long as possible, Atkinson said. Payers typically drive the decision making around how they pay a supplier, surveys by Aite Group have found. If more business turns to electronic payments, that could further hurt the Postal Service, which lost $5.1 billion in fiscal year 2011 and could see annual losses upward of $21 billion by 2016 if major changes are not made, Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe has said. President Obama, in his budget proposal in February, called for an end to Saturday mail delivery and other cost-cutting by the Postal Service. The Senate is to consider a bill this week that would allow the Postal Service to consider ending Saturday mail after two years. The service also has plans to close more than 200 mail processing plants, which would end next-day delivery of First Class Mail. “Everybody has a desire to get away from checks and move more electronic,” JPMorgan’s Kerwick said. “This is placing greater urgency around making that happen.” “The mail will take longer to cycle through,” Kerwick said. To be sure, many mid-sized businesses use check-writing software and are in no rush to install new systems, said Lex Litton, a consultant with Phoenix-Hecht, which specializes in collecting paper checks at third-party processing centers. A little more than half of payments received by larger companies still arrive by check, said Litton. For smaller companies about three-quarters are on paper. Overall, paper payments to businesses are decreasing by a couple of percentage points a year, Litton said, citing surveys by his firm. One reason for slow adoption is convenience. Sending checks in envelopes can allow businesses to easily add information that clarifies what they are paying and what discounts they might be applying. “I’m an advocate of both” paper and electronic payments, said Ron Tauscher, a senior product manager in Citigroup’s Global Transaction Services business. Tauscher said he is discussing the Postal Service issues with Citigroup’s customers. “It is clearly an opportunity to talk about their receivables,” he said. For payments still sent by check, some banks offer lockbox processing centers across the United States. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo together account for 35 of them. Crews from the centers go to nearby Postal Service sorting facilities around the clock to pick up envelopes with checks to be deposited quickly. Known as remittance mail, the envelopes would get special treatment under the Postal Service’s plans to cut costs, noted Litton. Banks would be able to continue to pick up those envelopes seven days a week even as first-class deliveries to businesses would become less frequent. As a result, businesses may sign up for the lockbox services, Wells Fargo’s Peltz said. Litton said remittance mail would still likely move more slowly than today, though that is not certain. Regardless, the threat of delays is useful to the banks. “This looks like an opportunity to say there is one more advantage to electronic payments,” said Litton. At Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Paul Simpson, head of global transaction services, said the bank is talking to clients about electronic payment options as well as looking at new ways to enhance and speed up deposit and lockbox services. Depending on the postal service’s consolidation plans, the bank could look at partnership opportunities at post office locations, where the bank could process checks and immediately capture electronic images of these payments. A partnership with the U.S. Postal Service could help “create revenue streams that benefit both parties,” Simpson said.

380,WFC,Wells Fargo to face lending program class-action suit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co was ordered to face a class-action lawsuit in Minnesota federal court by investors who accuse the bank of improperly touting a lending program as safe when in fact it was risky. Judge Donovan Frank of U.S. District Court in Minnesota, in certifying the case as a class-action on Tuesday, said the disgruntled investors should proceed as a group because they had common issues and were sufficiently similar. The City of Farmington Hills Employees Retirement System, a pension plan, sued Wells Fargo in October 2010 on behalf of 100 institutional investors over its securities lending program. In court papers, the plaintiffs said that starting in 2006, they had invested funds in the lending program, which they said the bank advertised as safe and low-risk. But Wells Fargo instead invested the money in risky and illiquid financial products such as mortgage backed securities, the plaintiffs said, and in so doing had breached its fiduciary duty.

383,WFC,"UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo, SEC told to meet in subpoena dispute","* Judge rejects SEC demand to compel subpoena compliance * SEC probes bank’s sale of $60 bln mortgage debt * SEC says has sought documents since September By Jonathan Stempel March 30 (Reuters) - A federal judge rejected the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s demand that Wells Fargo & Co comply with subpoenas related to a probe of the bank’s sale of $60 billion of mortgage-backed securities, but directed both sides to meet. In an order dated Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler in San Francisco directed the parties to try to resolve their dispute, and if they failed to explain why in writing. On March 23, the SEC had accused Wells Fargo of repeatedly ignoring its subpoenas, six of which had been issued since Sept. 30, and demanded compliance. The regulator is looking into whether Wells Fargo fraudulently misled investors about the risks of securities it sold from September 2006 to early 2008, including whether the underlying home loans complied with underwriting standards. Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said the bank was pleased with the judge’s decision. “This proceeding, which was filed without any notice to Wells Fargo, should never have been brought before this court,” he said. “The application falsely accuses Wells Fargo of not cooperating in connection with an investigation by the SEC staff.” The bank made 68 separate document productions of more than 750,000 pages and had responded to the “vast majority” of the staff’s 96 requests, Martinez said. More than 100 people,  including Wells’ internal and outside counsel, have spent thousands of hours gathering and producing documents to the SEC, he said. The bank “looks forward to addressing the lack of merit of the underlying substantive issues addressed by the SEC,” he added. The SEC declined to comment. Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco, and is the nation’s fourth-largest bank by assets and largest mortgage lender. The bank has not been accused of wrongdoing. It has called the SEC’s March 23 demand inappropriate, believing there had been an understanding with SEC staff about the document requests. Several major US banks have been faulted over their packaging and marketing of mortgage debt that proved riskier than expected. This debt was a major factor in both the 2008 financial crisis and the roughly five-year U.S. housing slump. The case is SEC v.

385,WFC,Wells Fargo opens business for the ultra-wealthy,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co opened its new Abbot Downing business on Monday, merging two of its wealth management units under a new brand it hopes will expand its market share of America’s richest families. The new business, catering to ultra-high-net-worth individuals and families with $50 million or more in investable assets, resulted from the combination of Wells’ Family Wealth unit and its Lowry Hill subsidiary. The name Abbot Downing comes from the 19th-century New Hampshire builder of the stagecoaches that have come to represent Wells Fargo. Since Wells first publicly announced the planned merger last November, the combined business has grown 20 percent to $32.9 billion in client assets under management. In those five months, the group added five billionaires and 13 individuals with $100 million or more in investable assets to its client base, said Jim Steiner, Abbot Downing’s president. “We’ve had new success in bringing in new foundation assets,” Steiner said. “People are leaving more money to foundations and endowments.” He said the biggest drivers of new wealth have been cash from the sale of company stakes through initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions. Steiner estimated that about 10,000 households in the United States have $50 million or more in investable assets. In an October study of 72 multifamily advising firms, the average client asset size was $48.4 million, according to research and consulting firm Family Wealth Alliance. Abbot Downing has just under 600 client relationships, including multiple families across generations. Steiner said the decision to rebrand the combined business was meant to establish a small-firm feel. Wells intended to distinguish its family wealth business from that of other bigger competitors, like the $62.4 billion Bessemer Trust. Abbot Downing was aiming to keep a client-to-adviser ratio of 15-to-one, which Steiner said was low. “Their biggest challenge will be to differentiate themselves from others,” said Tom Livergood, founder of Family Wealth Alliance. The family wealth management industry is highly fragmented, Livergood said, because of the wide-ranging needs of its clients — including traditional wealth investment management, as well as wealth succession planning. Abbot Downing has four divisions: an asset management division, a private banking channel, a combined trust and fiduciary service, and a group that addresses family psychology and governance. There are about 300 Abbot Downing employees working in 16 offices across the United States. Steiner said the firm would be hiring senior portfolio managers, analysts, relationship managers and planners.

390,WFC,Housing group files bias complaint against Wells Fargo,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A nonprofit group on Tuesday filed a discrimination complaint with the U.S. government accusing Wells Fargo & Co. of a failure to maintain foreclosed homes in minority neighborhoods compared with those vacant properties it owns in white areas. The complaint was filed by the National Fair Housing Alliance with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. “We found that with Wells Fargo, there was a neglect of simple things — a lack of routine maintenance and security of the property — that just didn’t happen in African American and Latino neighborhoods across the board,” said Shanna Smith, president of the National Fair Housing Alliance. The complaint stemmed from years of investigations by the group, which advocates for minorities on housing issues, into how major lenders maintain and market bank-owned properties in various real estate markets across the nation. In its complaint filed with HUD, the group said that in an independent investigation it completed on foreclosed properties owned by Wells Fargo, disparities existed in the maintenance and marketing of vacant homes for sale in minority neighborhoods compared with those homes in white neighborhoods. A spokesperson for HUD declined to provide any comment on the group’s complaint. Tom Goyda, a Wells Fargo spokesman, said in a statement that the institution “conducts all lending-related activities in a fair and consistent manner without regard to race, and this includes maintenance and marketing standards for all foreclosed properties.” “Regrettably, the complaint does not include specific property information that can allow us to investigate the circumstances in any of the markets they list,” he said. Wells Fargo said that when it is responsible for a property it has a department that conducts monthly inspections, completes maintenance work and secures and winterizes homes. In other instances, the bank may service the loans, but the investors who own the mortgages handle the maintenance and sale of their properties after foreclosure. The nonprofit group evaluated foreclosed properties owned by Wells Fargo in eight cities: Atlanta, Baltimore, Dallas, Dayton, Ohio, Miami, Oakland, California, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. They looked at 218 foreclosed properties owned by Wells Fargo. Included in the survey were 149 properties located in neighborhoods occupied by minority groups, of which 99 that were in predominantly African-American neighborhoods, while the remainder were populated in mostly white communities. The group used various statistics from its investigation to allege that properties in white communities were taken much better care of. For example, the group said that 56 percent of the foreclosed properties surveyed in the minority communities had substantial amounts of trash piling up, compared with 30 percent of Wells Fargo foreclosures in white neighborhoods that had the same problem. “I was just astonished by how poorly maintained so many of Wells Fargo properties were,” said Smith. “When you drive through some of these neighborhoods of color, you would just be stunned by the overgrowth of weeds, often there’s no for-sale sign in front of the house, some look completely abandoned.” In a report released by the group earlier this month, they faulted the banking industry for discrimination in the care and maintenance of foreclosures, and offered evidence of disparity in how banks keep up properties and market them in white communities compared to properties in black and Latino neighborhoods.

392,WFC,"Proxy firms back splitting of chairman, CEO at Wells Fargo","(Reuters) - Two proxy advisory firms are backing a shareholder proposal to split the roles of chairman and chief executive at Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), putting pressure on another U.S. bank to revamp its leadership structure. ISS Proxy Advisory Services and Glass Lewis & Co said an independent chairman is better able to oversee management and represent shareholder interests. Shareholders will vote on the proposal at the bank’s April 24 annual stockholder meeting. “The presence of an independent chairman fosters the creation of a thoughtful and dynamic board, not dominated by the views of senior management,” Glass Lewis wrote in its report, issued last week. Banks have been under pressure to improve their corporate governance after the 2008 financial crisis dragged down the industry and the U.S. economy, and spurred government bailouts. A broader push for independent boards began with passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002. Wells Fargo’s board opposes the proposal, arguing in the bank’s proxy filing that the company already has a lead director who provides independent oversight. Wells shareholders have rejected similar proposals for the past seven years. John Stumpf has been the bank’s CEO and chairman since early 2010. The separation of the chairman and CEO positions gained renewed attention last month when a national union agreed to withdraw a similar proposal at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) after the Wall Street bank created a lead director position. Lead directors typically can set agendas at board meetings, call meetings that exclude management and oversee corporate governance processes. Among the five biggest U.S. bank holding companies, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) have separate chairmen. Bank of America split the positions after shareholders backed the move in 2009 as the company reeled from its troublesome Merrill Lynch & Co acquisition. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) shareholders will vote at the bank’s annual meeting in May on a proposal to divide the duties. ISS and Glass Lewis haven’t issued recommendations for that vote. JPMorgan’s board asserted in its proxy statement that the “most effective leadership model for the firm” is to have CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon retain those positions. Wells Fargo stockholder Gerald Armstrong, who held around 39,000 shares as of November, proposed this year’s resolution. A lead director does not create the same authority as a board chairman, he wrote in a supporting statement in the proxy. In an interview, Armstrong, a long-time shareholder rights activist, said he has pushed for dividing the positions since the 1970s. “How bad does it have to get before shareholders approve this?” asked Armstrong. “That’s what happened at Bank of America.” Norges Bank Investment Management, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, has also expressed concern about governance at Wells Fargo, which Armstrong cited in his supporting statement. Norges submitted a proposal to allow stockholders to nominate director candidates at Wells, a resolution that will also be up for a vote this year. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment. Last year, support for proposals to split the chairman and CEO roles garnered an average of 33 percent of votes cast at shareholder meetings, compared with 28 percent in 2010, ISS said in its report. As of April 1, resolutions on the topic have been proposed at more than 30 companies this year, according to ISS, although it’s not clear how many will allow votes on the issue. Citing the 2011 Spencer Stuart Board Index Report, Glass Lewis said 41 percent of S&P; 500 companies have split the chairman and CEO positions, up from 33 percent in 2006. Twenty-one percent of boards have a truly independent chairman, compared with 10 percent in 2006, according to the index. Boards that don’t split the position may be less likely to fire a poorly performing CEO, Glass Lewis said, citing academic research. A recent study of 152 Swiss companies, however, found no difference in market valuations between companies that separate and don’t separate the roles, Glass Lewis said. At the beginning of this year, Wells Fargo’s independent board members appointed Stephen Sanger, a former chief executive of cereal maker General Mills Inc (GIS.N), as lead director. He replaced Philip Quigley, a former telecommunications executive who remained on the board. In 2011, ISS and Glass Lewis opposed Quigley’s election, raising questions about his independence because his son, Scott, worked for Wells Fargo. ISS and Glass Lewis are opposing his election again this year.

A lead director does not create the same authority as a board chairman, he wrote in a supporting statement in the proxy. In an interview, Armstrong, a long-time shareholder rights activist, said he has pushed for dividing the positions since the 1970s. “How bad does it have to get before shareholders approve this?” asked Armstrong. “That’s what happened at Bank of America.” Norges Bank Investment Management, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, has also expressed concern about governance at Wells Fargo, which Armstrong cited in his supporting statement. Norges submitted a proposal to allow stockholders to nominate director candidates at Wells, a resolution that will also be up for a vote this year. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment. Last year, support for proposals to split the chairman and CEO roles garnered an average of 33 percent of votes cast at shareholder meetings, compared with 28 percent in 2010, ISS said in its report. As of April 1, resolutions on the topic have been proposed at more than 30 companies this year, according to ISS,  although it’s not clear how many will allow votes on the issue. Citing the 2011 Spencer Stuart Board Index Report, Glass Lewis said 41 percent of S&P; 500 companies have split the chairman and CEO positions, up from 33 percent in 2006. Twenty-one percent of boards have a truly independent chairman, compared with 10 percent in 2006, according to the index. Boards that don’t split the position may be less likely to fire a poorly performing CEO, Glass Lewis said, citing academic research. A recent study of 152 Swiss companies, however, found no difference in market valuations between companies that separate and don’t separate the roles, Glass Lewis said. At the beginning of this year, Wells Fargo’s independent board members appointed Stephen Sanger, a former chief executive of cereal maker General Mills Inc, as lead director. He replaced Philip Quigley, a former telecommunications executive who remained on the board. In 2011, ISS and Glass Lewis opposed Quigley’s election, raising questions about his independence because his son, Scott,  worked for Wells Fargo. ISS and Glass Lewis are opposing his election again this year.",4112012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-governance/proxy-firms-back-splitting-of-chairman-ceo-at-wells-fargo-idUSL2E8FB84720120411
394,WFC,Housing group files bias complaint against Wells Fargo,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A nonprofit group on Tuesday filed a discrimination complaint with the U.S. government accusing Wells Fargo & Co. of a failure to maintain foreclosed homes in minority neighborhoods compared with those vacant properties it owns in white areas. The complaint was filed by the National Fair Housing Alliance with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. “We found that with Wells Fargo, there was a neglect of simple things — a lack of routine maintenance and security of the property — that just didn’t happen in African American and Latino neighborhoods across the board,” said Shanna Smith, president of the National Fair Housing Alliance. The complaint stemmed from years of investigations by the group, which advocates for minorities on housing issues, into how major lenders maintain and market bank-owned properties in various real estate markets across the nation. In its complaint filed with HUD, the group said that in an independent investigation it completed on foreclosed properties owned by Wells Fargo, disparities existed in the maintenance and marketing of vacant homes for sale in minority neighborhoods compared with those homes in white neighborhoods. A spokesperson for HUD declined to provide any comment on the group’s complaint. Tom Goyda, a Wells Fargo spokesman, said in a statement that the institution “conducts all lending-related activities in a fair and consistent manner without regard to race, and this includes maintenance and marketing standards for all foreclosed properties.” “Regrettably, the complaint does not include specific property information that can allow us to investigate the circumstances in any of the markets they list,” he said. Wells Fargo said that when it is responsible for a property it has a department that conducts monthly inspections, completes maintenance work and secures and winterizes homes. In other instances, the bank may service the loans, but the investors who own the mortgages handle the maintenance and sale of their properties after foreclosure. The nonprofit group evaluated foreclosed properties owned by Wells Fargo in eight cities: Atlanta, Baltimore, Dallas, Dayton, Ohio, Miami, Oakland, California, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. They looked at 218 foreclosed properties owned by Wells Fargo. Included in the survey were 149 properties located in neighborhoods occupied by minority groups, of which 99 that were in predominantly African-American neighborhoods, while the remainder were populated in mostly white communities. The group used various statistics from its investigation to allege that properties in white communities were taken much better care of. For example, the group said that 56 percent of the foreclosed properties surveyed in the minority communities had substantial amounts of trash piling up, compared with 30 percent of Wells Fargo foreclosures in white neighborhoods that had the same problem. “I was just astonished by how poorly maintained so many of Wells Fargo properties were,” said Smith. “When you drive through some of these neighborhoods of color, you would just be stunned by the overgrowth of weeds, often there’s no for-sale sign in front of the house, some look completely abandoned.” In a report released by the group earlier this month, they faulted the banking industry for discrimination in the care and maintenance of foreclosures, and offered evidence of disparity in how banks keep up properties and market them in white communities compared to properties in black and Latino neighborhoods.

397,WFC,"Wells Fargo profit rises, but expense concerns weigh","(Reuters) - A surge in mortgage banking income helped lift Wells Fargo & Co’s (WFC.N) first-quarter profit by 13 percent, but its shares fell on concerns that the bank is falling behind on its drive to cut expenses. Wells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. bank and the country’s biggest mortgage lender and servicer, said on Friday that net income increased to $4.25 billion, or 75 cents a share, from $3.76 billion, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. The results beat analysts’ average forecast of 73 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, but the bank’s shares were off 2.4 percent at $33.19 in afternoon trading on a down day for the stock market. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), which also reported stronger-than-expected results on Friday, were down 2.8 percent and the KBW Banks Index .BKX was off 2.3 percent. By another measure — net income available to common shareholders after the payment of preferred dividends — the bank earned $4 billion, compared with $3.6 billion a year earlier. Total revenue at Wells rose to $21.6 billion, from $20.3 billion a year earlier, signaling stronger demand for consumer and commercial loans. The bank’s executives said they continued to scout acquisitions with the potential to boost revenue. The San Francisco-based bank’s expenses rose to $13 billion from $12.5 billion in the fourth quarter, partly because of higher legal reserves and increased personnel costs related to mortgage banking compensation. Wells said it is targeting expenses of $11.25 billion in the fourth quarter, at the upper end of the range set out in its efficiency program called Project Compass. The bank previously called for expenses to drop as low as $10.75 billion, but it said on Friday higher-than-expected revenue from its mortgage business and acquisitions would also result in higher costs. Analysts peppered Chief Executive John Stumpf and Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan throughout an analyst conference call with concerns that expenses were not failing as quickly as the bank previously signaled. “Loan growth was softer than anticipated, while expenses were elevated,” Barclays Capital analyst Jason Goldberg wrote in a note to clients. Goldberg has an “overweight” rating on Wells shares. In an interview, Sloan said the bank’s efforts to reduce expenses nearly $2 billion by the fourth quarter would be helped by a $476 million drop in seasonal personnel expenses and the elimination of $250 million in merger costs related its 2008 Wachovia Corp acquisition. “Then, it’s a little bit here and a little bit there,” he said. Echoing comments by CEO Stumpf in the call with analysts, Sloan said the bank would miss its expense target only if it were in pursuit of higher revenues. Mortgage banking income at Well Fargo increased to $2.8 billion from $2 billion a year ago, as homeowners rushed to refinance home loans at low interest rates. About 15 percent of the bank’s applications came through government programs designed to help homeowners who owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth, the bank said. Sloan said the bank’s “pipeline” of mortgage applications was higher going into the second quarter than at the beginning of the first quarter. As other banks have pulled back from the home loans business amid concerns about losses and lawsuits stemming from the housing bust, Wells Fargo has been gaining market share, he noted. “We think we made the right decision by being consistent, and it’s paying off,” he said. Wells Fargo recorded a loan-loss provision of about $2 billion, down from about $2.2 billion a year earlier. The bank for the eighth straight quarter boosted results by freeing up cash reserves it had previously booked for bad loans. Loan growth in the bank’s core portfolios grew by $984 million in the first quarter, on gains in commercial, auto and student lending. However, some analysts noted that 87 percent of the increase reflected asset-based loans purchased by Wells during the quarter, instead of “organic” growth, a sign of fundamental improvement in the economy. The bank’s total loans at the end of the first quarter fell 4 percent from the previous three months to $766.5 billion. In the analyst call, executives said they expect continued core loan growth this year through acquisitions and organic growth. The bank’s previously announced purchase of an energy lending business from French bank BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) could close as early as next week, giving Wells Fargo nearly $4 billion in additional loans. Wells reported a slight improvement in net interest margin, the difference between what banks earn on their investments and what they pay for their funding. But CEO Stumpf said that yield would remain under pressure this year. “It was a good quarter,” said Gary Townsend, chief executive of Hill-Townsend Capital, but “I had actually expected them to do a bit better.” Wells Fargo and JPMorgan have emerged as two of the healthiest U.S. banks following the financial crisis. Both fared well in the Federal Reserve stress tests released last month and announced plans to increase their quarterly dividends and to buy back more of their own shares. Wells bought back 8 million shares during the quarter, primarily under a forward purchase contract it negotiated in the fourth quarter. As some banks shed assets to build capital, Wells Fargo is “definitely looking at other acquisition opportunities,” Sloan said. Because of a cap on deposit market share, the bank wouldn’t be likely to buy a commercial bank, but it could purchase more loan portfolios or make non-depository acquisitions, he said. Outside of the United States, the bank will continue to scout deals, but the likelihood of it buying a consumer or commercial bank is “pretty low,” he said. The bank already has plans to open additional corporate banking offices overseas, he said. “I would think about any sort of international acquisition being more consistent with our existing product set (rather) than something new or transformative,” Sloan said.

406,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Wells Fargo adds 16 advisers with $1.1 bln in assets,"April 18 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Company has bolstered its brokerage base across the United States, hiring at least 16 veteran advisers who managed more than $1.1 billion in client assets at their previous firms. The new hires, who joined in late March and early April, came from other top U.S. brokerages, including Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch and UBS Wealth Management Americas . “In our local market, Wells is by far the largest with the biggest presence,” said former UBS adviser Dennis Coleman, who joined Wells Fargo in Charleston, South Carolina in early April. “The real differentiator was the local management and the unlimited access that they gave us,” said Coleman, who said he liked that Wells conveyed a regional firm feel while still operating with the size and scope of a big firm. Coleman joined Wells Fargo Advisors with his partner, Thomas Dunleavy. The two advisers together managed $233 million in client assets and generated $1.8 million in revenue last year. They now report to branch manager Rodney Connell and complex manager Scott Spang. Also moving to Wells from UBS, adviser David Elfenbein joined the company in New York City and now reports to branch manager Dennis Schmidt. Elfenbein, a 14-year industry veteran, managed $85 million in client assets and last year generated $800,000 in revenue. Wells also added eight advisers from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, including two in its independent brokerage division. In New Hampshire, advisers Robert Robbins and Colleen Farley joined Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, the independent brokerage arm, as a team. The two advisers managed $89 million in client assets and generated $1.5 million in revenue last year. The other advisers from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney were Leonard Bernstein, Robyn Fain, Tim Ridley and William Link who joined Wells in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where they now report to branch manager Kenneth Heidenreich. They had managed $168 million in client assets at their old firm. Two other advisers joined Wells from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in Maryland and Tennessee. Adviser John Peterson, who managed $93 million in client assets, joined Wells’ Memphis office and now reports to complex manager Ari Litvin. In Maryland, adviser Jamie Waldren joined Wells’ Columbia office and reports to branch manager Rusty Johnson. He managed $96 million in client assets and generated $1.1 million in revenue last year. Joining Wells from Merrill Lynch, advisers Daniel Gilham and Daniel Woods joined Wells’ Jacksonville office, where they now report to complex manager Joe Bruno. They managed $116 million in client assets at their old firm. In Seattle, Washington, adviser Mark Seto joined Wells’ bank channel from Merrill, where he managed $137 million in client assets. He now reports to regional brokerage manager Jimmy Hawkins. Also on the move, former RBC Wealth advisers James Gibbons and Stephen Marohl joined Wells’ independent brokerage division as a team. They had managed $92.5 million in client assets and generated $1.1 million in revenue last year. Gibbons said he decided to join Wells because he wanted to move into the independent space but also wanted to have the backing of a well-known name. “Our concern with moving to a pure independent channel was that there was no name behind it,” he said in an interview on Wednesday. “If we were going to make a move, having the Wells Fargo logo behind us was going to be a huge advantage in terms of keeping clients at ease.” Earlier this week, Wells said its independent brokerage division expanded in 2011, with its client asset base for the unit growing 18 percent to $52.7 billion last year.

407,WFC,Occupy movement turning to shareholder meetings,"(Reuters) - Looking to build on the Occupy Wall Street movement, activists say they’re turning to corporate shareholder meetings this spring to vent their anger over economic disparity in the United States and to promote an assortment of other causes. A group called 99% Power — a reference to those not among the top 1 percent of earners — says it plans actions at 36 shareholder meetings, with the first big push coming at Tuesday’s Wells Fargo & Co gathering in San Francisco. The protests could give another jolt to the 2012 annual meeting season, which has already featured a shareholder vote of no confidence in Citigroup Inc’s executive compensation plan. Organizers say they expect hundreds of protesters to target a broad range of issues from foreclosures to financing of “dirty energy” to immigrant rights to corporate taxes. The group says it will try to stop the Wells Fargo meeting from being held and force the company to hold a public “stakeholders meeting” outside. “This is Occupy beginning the next phase,” said Rainforest Action Network Executive Director Rebecca Tarbotton, who is part of the effort. “We see people hungry to take action.” Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said the bank respects the rights of Americans to assemble peacefully and welcomes a dialogue with its stakeholders. “We will be prepared to ensure the annual meeting runs smoothly,” he said. The bank has a long history of responsible lending and community involvement, Martinez said. He stressed Wells Fargo’s work with struggling borrowers that has resulted in nearly 750,000 loan modifications and the reduction of more than $4 billion in principal. He also noted the bank is a major provider of jobs, with more than 264,000 full-time employees. Activists are expecting more protesters than in past years and are buoyed by grass-root campaigns last fall that led banks to cancel proposed debit card fees and moved disgruntled customers to shift their deposits to credit unions. Annual meetings give protesters a chance to make their case directly to corporate leaders, said George Goehl, executive director of National People’s Action and co-founder of The New Bottom Line. “It’s one of the rare places where you can engage the CEO and the board members who most of the year would blow you off,” said Goehl, another 99% Power organizer. The protests are expected to draw a mix of labor union members, environmentalists, customers and clergy members. On the target list are General Electric Co, Verizon Communications Inc, Bank of America Corp, Morgan Stanley, Sallie Mae and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Progressive groups have used annual shareholder meetings to promote their causes for decades, said Michael Kazin, a history professor at Georgetown University and author of “American Dreamers: How the Left Changed a Nation.” “Clearly the thrust of the Occupy movement was not to just draw attention to the 1 percent but also to what the protesters see as the evils of corporate America,” he said. It’s unclear how much of an impact the protests will have, Kazin said. “A lot of shareholders just care about the price of their stock,” he said. “It can take awhile to have an impact.” ",4182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-protests-shareholdermeetings/occupy-movement-turning-to-shareholder-meetings-idUSBRE83H1G120120418

409,WFC,"Protesters picket Wells Fargo meeting, 24 arrested","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Police in riot gear arrested two dozen people on Tuesday as protesters with a huge inflated rat sought to disrupt a Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) annual shareholder meeting to express anger over foreclosures, executive compensation and corporate taxes. Several of those arrested were handcuffed and taken away in police vans as hundreds more chanted and waved signs outside the meeting in a building across from the bank’s San Francisco headquarters. “Wells Fargo is one of the largest and most corrupt Wall Street banks and has foreclosed on hundreds of thousands of homes,” said Charles Davidson, an organizer with Move On East Bay. “I think it’s really important that we stand up to this or the economic crisis will continue.” Protesters gathered on a street corner near an inflated rat that had dollar bills coming from side pockets. They held signs that read: “99 percent take over, topple the 1 percent” and “Up with the people, down with the bankers.” Police said there were more than 500 protesters and confirmed 24 arrests, including 14 people who were removed from the meeting. Activist groups are targeting corporate stockholder meetings this spring to draw attention to economic disparity in the United States and to promote a variety of other causes. A group called 99% Power, a reference to those not among the top 1 percent of earners, has said it plans actions at 36 shareholder meetings, starting with Wells Fargo. The group said it was demanding that Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf resign and that the bank halt foreclosures pending investigation and reform. Wells Fargo has emerged from the financial crisis as one of the healthier U.S. banks and it has expanded across the United States after buying North Carolina-based Wachovia Corp in 2008. The bank is the largest U.S. mortgage originator and servicer, making it a target for protesters who say lenders have poorly treated struggling borrowers. Wells was one of five big lenders to agree this year to a $25 billion national mortgage settlement over foreclosure abuses. Inside the shareholder meeting, Stumpf highlighted the bank’s efforts to work with struggling homeowners, including 740,000 loan modifications and more than $4 billion in forgiven loan balances. But he acknowledged the pain of homeowners who have lost their homes. “We did not help everyone,” he said. “We could not help everyone. In some cases, we cannot avoid that.” The meeting began on time, but protesters interrupted the proceedings multiple times, causing police to remove them. During the meeting, shareholders ratified the bank’s 2011 executive compensation plan by an overwhelming margin, elected the bank’s slate of directors and rejected four shareholder resolutions. Last week, shareholders delivered a rebuke to Citigroup Inc’s (C.N) management with a surprising vote of no confidence in the bank’s executive compensation plan. At the Wells meeting, more than 96 percent of shares cast were in favor of the bank’s pay plan. Stumpf received $19.8 million in total compensation in 2011, an increase of about 5 percent from the previous year. Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit’s pay rose to $14.8 million in 2011, up from a token $1 the year before. Among the shareholder resolutions, a proposal to split the chairman and CEO roles held by Stumpf received the most support, about 38 percent of votes cast. Last year, resolutions to split the positions garnered an average of 33 percent of votes cast at shareholder meetings, according to ISS Proxy Advisory Services, one of two advisory firms that had backed the Wells Fargo proposal. The meeting ended after an hour and a half and no questions from the audience. “This is a first,” Stumpf said. After the meeting, some protesters marched one block away to stop in front of building where Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) is a tenant. Those who were arrested celebrated outside Wells Fargo’s headquarters building, across the street from the shareholder meeting. “We made it very clear to shareholders and John Stumpf that we will not keep quiet while they hurt our communities with their bad business practices,” said Veronica Castro, 30, campaign director, National People’s Action and one of the 14 arrested inside the meeting. “We’ve tried to negotiate and communicate, but they haven’t been responsive and that’s why we came here.” ",4242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wellsfargo-protests/protesters-picket-wells-fargo-meeting-24-arrested-idUSBRE83N19B20120424

Advisers Dmitry Farbman, Leo Khorolinsky and Paul Stepankovskiy joined UBS’s Northbrook, Illinois office from Wells Fargo Advisors. UBS did not disclose the advisers’ production or client assets managed. The advisers, collectively known as the FKS Wealth Management Group, have been in the industry for more than 15 years. They had also previously worked at Merrill Lynch. The team now reports to complex director Kim Jenson, managing director of UBS’s Northern Illinois and Wisconsin area wealth management offices. UBS’s Americas wealth management group is the fourth-largest U.S. brokerage by client assets with $754 billion in assets under management and just under 7,000 advisers as of the end of December. The firm has been the most successful of the top U.S. brokerages in recruiting top talent so far this year, based on client assets managed by those advisers joining UBS. In March and early April, the firm added at least 12 veteran advisers from competing brokerages including Bank of America’s  Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. Those advisers joining UBS managed more than $2 billion in client assets at their previous firms.",4242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/ubs-financial/on-the-move-ubs-lands-adviser-team-from-wells-fargo-idUSL2E8FOB4820120424

422,WFC,UPDATE 2-Wells Fargo buying prime brokerage firm Merlin,"By Rick Rothacker April 27 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co is buying a prime brokerage firm in its first foray into the business of providing trading, reporting and other services for hedge funds. The acquisition of Merlin Securities LLC gives the No. 4 U.S. bank a platform for growing in the prime brokerage business and for selling other products and services to hedge funds, said Chris Bartlett, Wells Fargo’s head of equity sales and trading. “It’s a way for us to wade into the business and grow over time,” Bartlett said in an interview. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo did not disclose the terms of the acquisition. Merlin, based in New York and San Francisco, serves more than 500 hedge funds, each with less than $2 billion in assets, but Wells could eventually target larger firms, Bartlett said. Merlin’s 100 employees will join Wells Fargo Securities, the bank’s capital markets and investment banking unit. Merlin’s managing partners, Stephan Vermut and Aaron Vermut, will continue to lead the business. The deal, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the third quarter. Wells has been active on the acquisition front in recent months, mostly buying loan portfolios from European banks looking to build capital. on Tuesday, Wells finalized its purchase of a North American  energy-lending business from BNP Paribas SA. Wells emerged from the financial crisis as one of the healthier U.S. banks, partly because it eschewed some of the riskier capital markets activities that damaged some of its peers. The bank became a bigger player in these businesses when it bought Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia Corp in 2008, but Chief Executive John Stumpf has emphasized Wells only likes the client-driven part of the business, not riskier trading ventures. Bartlett said Merlin brings minimal risk to Wells because it is essentially a processing business. The firm sends clients needing loans to Goldman Sachs Group Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Wells over time will make loans to hedge funds, but clients will be able to still choose to do business with Goldman or JPMorgan, he said. “The Wells way is very thoughtful and gradual,” Bartlett said. “We will grow with the client base.” Merlin is the second hedge fund-related acquisition by Wells in the past year. In September, it bought LaCrosse Global Fund Services, which provides hedge fund administration services. The two businesses will continue to operate separately, Bartlett said. Wells Fargo’s wholesale banking unit, which includes capital markets and investment banking businesses, reported a first-quarter profit of $1.9 billion, up 14 percent from a year ago. The unit accounted for 41 percent of the bank’s net income. Wells Fargo shares were down 1 cent to $33.83 in early afternoon trading on a mixed day for bank stocks.",4272012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-merlin/update-2-wells-fargo-buying-prime-brokerage-firm-merlin-idUSL2E8FR4BQ20120427

430,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Washington Wealth lands Wells Fargo adviser team,"April 30 (Reuters) - Washington Wealth Management LLC, an independent advisory firm that has grown by hiring away top talent from big U.S. brokerages, has landed a team of advisers from Wells Fargo & Company. Advisers Rick Montejano, David Yee and Jeff Mramor of the Pacific Point Asset Management Team joined Washington Wealth on Friday, opening its first office in the Los Angeles market. They managed $120 million in client assets at Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage unit of the San Francisco-based bank. The team generated $1.4 million in revenue last year. The new office in Woodland Hills, California, is Washington Wealth’s seventh office in the United States and will be managed by director Whit Whitehouse. Montejano, a 25-year industry veteran, started with Dean Witter in the early 1980s. The three advisers had been with Wells Fargo for about five years before moving to Washington Wealth. Washington Wealth, based in Virginia and founded two years ago by former Morgan Stanley complex manager Tony Sirianni, has marketed itself as an opportunity for financial advisers to break away from traditional wirehouse relationships and cultures found at larger banks. Advisers who join Washington Wealth also receive a higher percentage of their fees and commissions, about 70 percent, than what is typically offered at most big firms.",4302012,http://www.reuters.com/article/washington-wealth/on-the-move-washington-wealth-lands-wells-fargo-adviser-team-idUSL1E8FUEYU20120430
431,WFC,Dissident shareholders want access to BofA meeting,"(Reuters) - An activist group is urging Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) to allow all shareholders to enter next week’s annual meeting, after Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) excluded attendees who disagreed with the bank’s business practices. The group, called 99% Power, sent a letter on Monday to Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan asking to meet with him by Friday May 4 to ensure the meeting room is large enough and that shareholders are allowed to designate a proxy to attend on their behalf. The activists said they will have legal and citizen rights observers on hand for the meeting, on May 9 in Charlotte, North Carolina, site of Bank of America’s headquarters. “It is vital that legitimate shareholder rights be respected,” leaders of the group wrote in the letter to Moynihan. Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri declined to comment. Last week, more than 500 protesters marched to the site of Wells Fargo’s annual meeting in San Francisco to express anger over foreclosures, executive compensation and corporate taxes. Wells gave preferential treatment to some shareholders, while excluding others who had waited hours to enter, 99% Power said in a news release on Monday. Some protesters did make it inside the meeting, where they interrupted CEO John Stumpf’s remarks multiple times. Stumpf called them out of order, and a total of 14 were removed from the meeting and arrested. Wells Fargo spokesman Oscar Suris said the company did its best to accommodate as many shareholders as possible. “For safety reasons, we could not overlook the fact that several groups had made it a very public objective to shut down (last week’s) meeting,” Suris said. Looking to build on the Occupy Wall Street movement, 99% Power — a reference to those not among the top 1 percent of earners — has said it is targeting corporate shareholder meetings to express concerns about economic disparity in the United States. Last week, nearly 100 protesters disrupted General Electric Co’s (GE.N) shareholder meeting, held a day after Wells Fargo’s. The group said protesters at the Bank of America meeting will urge the company, the second-largest U.S. bank, to do more to help struggling borrowers avoid foreclosure, pay more in taxes, stop supporting coal-based energy projects and pledge to keep corporate money out of elections. Security will be tighter than at past meetings after Charlotte’s city manager on Monday declared Bank of America’s shareholder meeting an “extraordinary event” under an ordinance passed in January to help officials handle protests expected in the city during the Democratic National Convention in September. The ordinance allows the city to ban certain items, ranging from backpacks to crowbars, at large events. A “significant number” of demonstrators are expected to attend the Bank of America meeting, the city said in a news release.

434,WFC,FINRA fines four brokerages $9.1 million over ETF sales,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc Morgan Stanley, UBS AG and Wells Fargo & Co agreed to pay more than $9.1 million in fines and restitution for selling leveraged and inverse exchange-traded funds “without reasonable supervision,” the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said. The settlements announced on Tuesday are the latest move by regulators to clamp down on these complex investments. But some investor advocates wonder if the fines go far enough in a case involving $27.1 billion in transactions. The brokerages likely earned much more in commissions from selling the products than they are now paying in fines, said industry observers. “What kind of deterrence does this serve if they can still keep (nearly all) of the profits from the trading...?” said Jill Gross, director of the Investor Rights Clinic at Pace Law School in New York. Wells Fargo customers transacted the most business of the four brokerages, buying and selling a total of $9.9 billion, followed by Citi ($7.9 billion), Morgan Stanley ($4.8 billion) and UBS ($4.5 billion). Bradley Bennett, director of enforcement at FINRA, told Reuters that the sanctions are severe for a case involving suitability of investments. Bennett said steeper penalties were not appropriate because the products in question have not collapsed and the securities had not inflicted significant losses on investors. Leveraged and inverse ETFs are designed to amplify short-term returns by using debt and derivatives and are considered more suitable for professional traders than for long-term retail investors. They make up just $29.3 billion of the $1.15 trillion U.S. ETF market, according to Lipper. In 2009, FINRA and other regulators began issuing warnings about the sale of these investments because they worried that brokers were selling them to buy-and-hold investors. In July 2011, Massachusetts’ top securities regulator sued RBC Capital Markets LLC and one of its brokers over its sales of leveraged ETFs to clients who did not understand them. And last March, FINRA barred a former broker for Morgan Keegan & Co for making excessive and inappropriate trades in a group of leveraged and inverse ETFs for clients. Meanwhile, in 2010 the SEC stopped approving new ETFs that use derivatives. As a result of the increased regulatory scrutiny, brokerage firms have placed restrictions on how they sell leveraged and inverse ETFs. For example, Bank of America Corp’s Merrill Lynch unit only allows investors to buy leveraged and inverse ETFs if they request them, a policy in place since 2009. The firm also requires its employees to complete and pass a training course on the products. UBS, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley have instituted similar restrictions in the past few years, spokeswomen for the companies said. In Tuesday’s settlement, FINRA found that from January 2008 through June 2009, UBS, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and Citi did not have the supervisory systems in place to properly monitor the sales of leveraged and inverse ETFs and failed to conduct adequate due diligence regarding the risks and features of the ETFs, according to the statement. Citigroup was fined $2 million and ordered to pay $146,431 in restitution. Wells Fargo was fined $2.1 million and ordered to pay $641,489 in restitution. Morgan Stanley was fined $1.75 million and ordered to pay $604,584, and UBS was fined $1.5 million and ordered to pay $431,488. FINRA determines fines for its members based on its sanctioning guidelines. The firms said they supervised these non-traditional ETFs the same way they did traditional ETFs, but that the supervisory systems in place were not tailored enough to address the risks and unique features involved with these products. Each firm’s settlement refers to investors who had purchased the risky ETFs recommended by their broker. Most were in their 50s or older and had conservative investment profiles with limited or no risk tolerance. For example: * At Citi, a 59-year-old investor with a conservative risk profile and net worth less than $600,000 held one of the securities for 122 days and lost more than $4,500. * A 65-year-old conservative customer of Wells Fargo with a stated net worth less than $50,000 held a non-traditional ETF for 43 days and sustained losses of more than $25,000. * At Morgan Stanley, an 89-year-old with a net worth under $200,000, allocated nearly 60 percent of an account to non-traditional ETFs for 39 days, losing more than $10,000. * A 64-year-old UBS customer with a conservative risk profile and net worth of $290,000 held a non-traditional ETF for 139 days and sustained losses of more than $5,700 — 43 percent of his initial investment.

Leveraged and inverse ETFs are designed to amplify short-term returns by using debt and derivatives and are considered more suitable for professional traders than for long-term retail investors. They make up only $29.3 billion of the $1.15 trillion U.S. ETF market, according to Lipper. FINRA found that, from January 2008 through June 2009, the brokerage firms did not have the supervisory systems in place to properly monitor the sales of leveraged and inverse ETFs and failed to conduct adequate due diligence regarding the risks and features of the ETFs, according to the statement. Settlement agreements the four brokerages signed with FINRA show the extent to which customers invested billions in the risky securities as the market grew. Investors bought and sold about $27.1 billion collectively in the risky ETFs from the four brokerages during period, according to a review of the settlements. Wells Fargo customers transacted the most business of the four groups, buying and selling a total of $9.9 billion, followed by Citi ($7.9 bi llion), Morgan Stanley ($4.8 billion) and UBS ($4.5 billion). In all of the cases, the regulator found that the brokerages did not have adequate supervision systems for their brokers, and other procedures in place to ensure that sales of the ETFs complied with FINRA rules, according to a settlement. Citigroup was fined $2 million and ordered to pay $146,431 in restitution. Wells Fargo was fined $2.1 million and ordered to pay $641,489 in restitution. Morgan Stanley was fined $1.75 million and ordered to pay $604,584, and UBS was fined $1.5 million and ordered to pay $431,488.

The firms said they supervised these non-traditional ETFs the same way they supervised traditional ETFs, but that the general supervisory systems in place were not tailored enough to address the risks and unique features involved with these products. Each firm’s settlement refers to investors who had purchased the risky ETFs recommended by their broker — even though they were not buy-and-hold investments.

439,WFC,White powder envelopes close NYC bank branches,"(Reuters) - A rash of incidents involving envelopes containing a suspicious white powder had police scrambling around New York City on Monday and forced the nation’s fourth-biggest bank, Wells Fargo & Co, to shut down five branches. In all six cases, the substance turned out to be “non- hazardous,” and in one case, the powder was identified as corn starch, a police spokesman said. Four of the mailed envelopes contained an identical note, which included the language “Happy May Day,” the spokesman said. The incident comes on the eve of a planned day of protests organized by the Occupy Wall Street movement and labor groups across the country. According to a website called maydaynyc.org, demonstrations are planned in New York City against “the corporations who rule our city.” Ed Needham, a member of Occupy Wall Street’s New York media team, said he had found no connection between the incident and his movement. “It doesn’t sound like something that we would do,” he said. A spokesman for Wells Fargo said its branches would remain closed pending further investigation by the police. The branch locations include Third Avenue and 47th Street; Madison Avenue and 34th Street; and Broadway and 85th Street. Since it was launched eight months ago, Occupy Wall Street has targeted U.S. financial policies it blames for the yawning income gap between rich and poor - between what they called the 1 percent and the 99 percent. More than 500 protesters demonstrated at the bank’s annual shareholder meeting in San Francisco last week to express anger over foreclosures, executive compensation and corporate taxes.

440,WFC,UPDATE 2-White powder envelopes close NYC bank branches,"April 30 (Reuters) - A rash of incidents involving envelopes containing a suspicious white powder had police scrambling around New York City on Monday and forced the nation’s fourth-biggest bank, Wells Fargo & Co, to shut down five branches. In all six cases, the substance turned out to be “non- hazardous,” and in one case, the powder was identified as corn starch, a police spokesman said. Four of the mailed envelopes contained an identical note, which included the language “Happy May Day,” the spokesman said. The incident comes on the eve of a planned day of protests organized by the Occupy Wall Street movement and labor groups across the country. According to a website called maydaynyc.org, demonstrations are planned in New York City against “the corporations who rule our city.” Ed Needham, a member of Occupy Wall Street’s New York media team, said he had found no connection between the incident and his movement. “It doesn’t sound like something that we would do,” he said. A spokesman for Wells Fargo said its branches would remain closed pending further investigation by the police. The branch locations include Third Avenue and 47th Street; Madison Avenue and 34th Street; and Broadway and 85th Street. Since it was launched eight months ago, Occupy Wall Street has targeted U.S. financial policies it blames for the yawning income gap between rich and poor - between what they called the 1 percent and the 99 percent. More than 500 protesters demonstrated at the bank’s annual shareholder meeting in San Francisco last week to express anger over foreclosures, executive compensation and corporate taxes.

442,WFC,"ON THE MOVE-Morgan Stanley hires brokers from UBS, Wells Fargo","May 2 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the largest U.S. brokerage, has bolstered its adviser base with new hires from rival firms UBS Wealth Management Americas and Wells Fargo Advisors, the company said on Wednesday. The advisers, who joined Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in Missouri, Ohio and Texas, were longtime producers at their old firms before moving in April. In Texas, advisers Frank Bagrier and Wes Coyle joined Morgan Stanley Smith Barney’s Woodlands office from UBS  , where they managed $135 million in client assets and generated $1.1 million in revenue last year. Bagrier, a more than three-decade industry veteran, had been with his predecessor firm since 1980. He had also previously worked for Merrill Lynch in the late 1970s. Bagrier and Coyle now report to branch manager Jason Jones at their new firm. In Missouri, advisers Jeffrey Hollingsworth, William Simpson and Craig Billingsley joined Morgan Stanley Smith Barney’s Clayton office from Wells Fargo, where they generated $3.2 million in revenue last year. The adviser team now reports to complex manager Richard Lindquist. Simpson had been with his predecessor firm for nearly four decades, having started with A.G. Edwards & Sons in the early 1970s. A.G. Edwards was acquired in 2007 by Wachovia, which was purchased by Wells one year later. In Ohio, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney also added former UBS adviser John Bello and his team to its Graystone Consulting business, the firm’s institutionally focused consulting unit. Bello, who serves as an institutional consultant, was joined by Brian Mackert and Christopher Olszewski, also formerly with UBS. The advisers join a team based in greater Pittsburgh and headed by Gregory Simakas. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, which formed from the merger of Morgan Stanley’s wealth unit and Citigroup’s Smith Barney in 2009, had 17,193 advisers managing $1.7 trillion client assets at the end of March. The firm has added advisers who managed at least $7.4 billion in client assets at their old firms since the start of the year, based on moves tracked by Reuters. On the flip side, the firm has also lost advisers who managed $7.2 billion in client assets to rival brokerages over the same period.",5022012,http://www.reuters.com/article/morgan-stanley/on-the-move-morgan-stanley-hires-brokers-from-ubs-wells-fargo-idUSL1E8G2B0P20120502
443,WFC,Wells Fargo increases mortgage dominance,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co made a record 33.9 percent of U.S. mortgage loans in the first quarter, as rivals such as Bank of America Corp continued to pull back in the home lending market. Wells Fargo’s loan volume more than tripled the 10.6 percent market share of its nearest rival, JPMorgan Chase & Co, as it increased its dominance in the industry, according to a report released on Thursday by industry publication Inside Mortgage Finance. U.S. Bancorp jumped to third from fifth. The rankings show diverging strategies for some of the largest U.S. banks at a time of shrinking loan volume and increased regulatory scrutiny of the industry. Wells Fargo and US Bancorp made more loans in the first quarter, while J.P. Morgan, Bank of America and Citigroup all saw their volume shrink compared with the fourth quarter. Total mortgage originations of $385 billion in the first quarter were down from $400 billion in the fourth quarter, but up from $335 billion a year ago. Mortgage banking income helped boost results at Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp when they reported earnings last month. At an investor conference on Tuesday, Wells chief financial officer Tim Sloan said the bank’s market share could continue to grow in the current environment. “We like the business a lot,” Sloan said. Last month, U.S. Bancorp CEO Richard Davis said the Minneapolis-based regional bank had added mortgage offices, loan officers and new technology to become a bigger player in the business. “We see a market share (opportunity) that you only get once in a lifetime,” Davis said. Meanwhile, Bank of America, which has faced huge losses and lawsuits from its 2008 Countrywide Financial acquisition, stopped buying mortgages last year from smaller lenders - a business known as correspondent lending - as it focused on making loans through its own branches. Remaining fourth in the rankings, its total volume fell by more than one-fourth to $16 billion from the fourth quarter. Bank of America’s Countrywide purchase initially made it the largest U.S. mortgage lender. Last month, CEO Brian Moynihan said Bank of America had purposely lost market share by shedding its correspondent lending business, but acknowledged the bank “underperformed” in making loans directly to consumers. The bank is adding loan officers to improve results, he said. Citigroup Inc fell to fifth from fourth in the rankings. In February, the bank said it would stop originating home loans through mortgage brokers. Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup are among five servicers that reached a $25 billion settlement that was finalized in April with state and federal officials over foreclosure abuses. Ally Financial Inc, the fifth servicer, was the 10th largest originator of home loans in the first quarter, down from sixth in the fourth quarter after it also retreated in the correspondent lending business.

447,WFC,Wells Fargo may face fair lending claims,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) could face civil charges from the U.S. Department of Justice under laws that prohibit discrimination against minority homebuyers, the bank disclosed on Tuesday. The fourth-largest U.S. bank said in a securities filing it believes the charges should not be brought and said it is seeking to show the department that it is in compliance with fair lending laws. A bank spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the filing. The disclosure comes several months after Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) Countrywide Financial unit agreed in December to pay a record $335 million to settle similar charges. The Justice Department accused Countrywide of charging blacks and Hispanics higher interest rates and fees than whites, and steering minorities to more expensive subprime loans even though they were qualified for traditional mortgage rates. Countrywide denied the department’s allegations. A DOJ spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Separately, Wells Fargo received an $85 million penalty last year from the Federal Reserve Board over charges that it steered borrowers into high-cost loans. The Fed then ordered Wells to compensate certain borrowers between $1,000 and $20,000. The cities of Baltimore and Memphis also filed suits alleging Wells Fargo engaged in “reverse redlining,” or intentionally targeting minority communities for predatory mortgage loans, leading to high foreclosures in minority neighborhoods. In its Tuesday filing, Wells Fargo said it faced government investigations into whether the bank violated fair lending “and other laws and regulations relating to mortgage origination practices.” San Francisco-based Wells Fargo is the largest servicer and originator of home loans in the United States. Wells Fargo made a record 33.9 percent of U.S. mortgage loans in the first quarter, as rivals such as Bank of America continued to pull back in the home lending market, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Wells Fargo’s loan volume was more than triple the 10.6 percent market share of its nearest rival, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N). The bank also said it faces investigations into whether it properly disclosed risks related to mortgage-backed securities in offering documents for investors. In February, Wells said it had received notice that it may face an enforcement action from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Tension over the investigation became public when the SEC in March accused Wells of repeatedly ignoring its subpoenas for documents and asked a federal court to compel the bank to turn over requested materials. The bank called the maneuver “inappropriate,” and a judge has ordered the two parties to try to resolve their dispute. In its court filing, the SEC said it is looking into whether Wells Fargo made “material misrepresentations or omitted material facts” in offerings it made to investors from September 2006 through early 2008, a period that included the beginning of the financial crisis. Wells Fargo shares were down 0.9 percent at $33.19 at midday Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

454,WFC,Allonhill suspended from foreclosure review,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Conflict of interest concerns have caused banking regulators to dismiss a consulting group helping U.S. banks review mortgage loan files to determine the scope of foreclosure abuses, the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) announced on Friday. The OCC said Allonhill had been helping Aurora Bank FSB and Wells Fargo & Co review foreclosure files and has been told to cease doing so because it previously reviewed some of the same loans for an unidentified third party. The OCC said it suspended Denver-based Allonhill “to ensure the independence of the loan review process going forward.” In April 2011, banking regulators reached a deal with 14 banks on the steps they have to take to clean up how they deal with struggling homeowners. As part of the deal, the servicers are required to hire independent consultants to review their loan files from 2009 and 2010 to determine if any laws or regulations were violated during the foreclosure process. Allonhill said in a statement that it was disappointed with the OCC’s decision. “At Allonhill, we have always been committed to the highest levels of integrity and transparency,” the housing-focused consultancy said in a statement. “While we have the utmost regard for the objectives of the Independent Foreclosure Review process and its positive impact on the mortgage industry, we are profoundly disappointed by the OCC’s decision.” Allonhill was the primary consultant for Aurora Bank.

Edwards & Sons, said on Wednesday it expanded its adviser base with a recent hire from Wells Fargo & Co. Adviser Christopher McGill moved to Benjamin Edwards from Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage unit of the San Francisco-based bank. McGill joined Benjamin Edwards’ office in Wichita, Kansas, which opened just over 14 months ago. “We had been working on recruiting Chris for quite some time,” said branch manager Roger Buller, who has known McGill since 2005. “He is a good cultural fit ... He’s got a loyal client following, and I think we’ll see that reflected in his transition over.” McGill previously been an engineer with Cargill for eight years and served in the U.S. Army before becoming a financial adviser. Since its founding in 2008, Benjamin Edwards has increased i ts adviser base by hiring dozens of legacy A.G. Edwards advisers from Wells Fargo. Since the start of the year, the firm has recruited at least 16 advisers from Wells Fargo, based on moves tracked by Reuters. A.G. Edwards & Sons was acquired in 2007 by Wachovia, which one year later was acquired by Wells Fargo. Many legacy A.G. Edwards advisers stayed with the brokerage through the acquisitions.

462,WFC,Analysts have questions about Wells Fargo's risks,"(Reuters) - Analysts are likely to pepper Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) with questions about its investment portfolio at the bank’s investor day on Tuesday, after JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) disclosed a surprise investment loss this month. Wells Fargo faces the same pressure as JPMorgan and every other U.S. bank right now: boosting income is tough when loan demand is weak and lending margins are tight. Deposits have been flooding into the bank, and it has struggled to find good places to invest them. JPMorgan’s excess deposits were invested by the bank’s Chief Investment Office, which made trades that have generated at least $2 billon of paper losses. Wells has been one of the more successful U.S. banks in recent years. It expanded to the East Coast after its 2008 purchase of Wachovia, and now eclipses JPMorgan as the largest bank by market value.",5212012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargos/analysts-have-questions-about-wells-fargos-risks-idUSBRE84K0VH20120521

465,WFC,Wells Fargo increases return targets,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) on Tuesday increased its goals for returns on assets and shareholder payouts while executives pledged to carefully manage risk throughout the company’s sweeping operations. The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets is aiming for a return on assets of 1.3 to 1.6 percent, depending on the economic and regulatory environment, Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said at the beginning of an investor day for analysts in New York. The San Francisco-based bank has emerged from the financial crisis as one of the strongest U.S. banks, but analysts are likely to pose questions about its securities portfolio and investment banking ambitions following JPMorgan Chase & Co’s (JPM.N) disclosure of at least $2 billion of trading losses in its Chief Investment Office. The top range of Wells Fargo’s return on assets goal exceeds the 1.5 percent target the bank laid out in 2010 and compares with a 1.31 percent ratio in the first quarter of this year. Banks lately have been struggling to boost revenue at a time of weak loan demand and tight lending margins. “We think we can grow from here even in this environment,” Sloan said. Wells Fargo also said the bank’s return on equity goal of 12 to 15 percent could eventually translate into a shareholder payout of about 50 to 65 percent of net income, including common stock dividends and share repurchases. The bank’s dividend payout was 30 percent of net income in the first quarter after the Federal Reserve this spring allowed the company to raise its quarterly dividend to 22 cents per share. The bank did not provide a current payout ratio including share repurchases but a slide presentation said the target represented an increase. In his opening remarks, Sloan said the bank’s credit default swaps portfolio grew too large three years ago, and the bank has now reduced it to about a quarter of its original size. JPMorgan’s trading strategy involved credit default swaps, a kind of derivative that was at the center of the 2008 financial crisis. Sloan emphasized the bank’s commitment to monitor risks throughout the company. “You can’t take out-sized risk in the financial services industry, and we do our best not to do it,” he said. In a contrast with JPMorgan, Wells “does not have a CIO function that employs large-scale macroeconomic credit-derivative hedges,” Wells spokeswoman Mary Eshet said on Tuesday. Bank of America (BAC.N) CEO Brian Moynihan on Monday said his bank also does not make broad hedging bets at the corporate level. Teams led by Sloan and wholesale banking head Dave Hoyt manage Wells Fargo’s $230 billion securities portfolio. Since the beginning of 2011, Wells has completed or agreed to seven deals to buy loan portfolios, business units or other companies. The bank is “well-positioned” for acquisition opportunities but will be disciplined in reviewing potential deals, according to Sloan’s slides. Wells expanded to the East Coast with its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia. In its latest deal, the bank agreed to buy a prime brokerage firm, allowing it to offer clearing and other services to hedge funds for the first time. In another presentation, community banking head Carrie Tolstedt said Wells plans to open more branches in key markets, a contrast to Bank of America, which is shedding branches. Wells has more than 6,200 U.S. branches, the most of any U.S. bank. The bank is also rolling out new technology to speed up service and cut costs, Tolstedt said. Touchscreen pads in teller lines will allow customers to receive receipts via email and to transfer funds, she said. Wells Fargo shares were up 2.1 percent at $32.07 on Tuesday afternoon. The shares are up about 14 percent this year, better than the 10 percent increase in the KBW bank index .BKX.

Advisers William Schick and Paul Derrick, who generated a combined $1.5 million in annual revenue, joined Morgan Stanley Smith Barney on Friday after nearly a decade at Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage unit of the San Francisco-based bank. The advisers joined Morgan Stanley Smith Barney’s Syracuse office, where they now report to complex manager Dean Wallace.

The advisers are among the latest additions for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, which added at least 71 experienced advisers managing nearly $9 billion in client assets since the start of the year, based on moves tracked by Reuters. The firm was formed after the merger of Morgan Stanley’s  wealth unit and Citigroup’s Smith Barney in 2009.

The new additions, who manage more than $400 million in combined client assets, came from LPL Financial and CCO Investment Services Corp. The teams joined Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, the company’s broker-dealer division catering to independent advisers who also function as business owners. In California, advisers Robert Floe, Kenneth Sanchez, Lee Wolfe and Marjan Neyestani Khazra joined Wells with their independent firm, Floe Financial Partners, on Monday. Floe, based in Pasadena, had been with LPL for nearly two decades. The team manages more than $300 million in client assets. In Connecticut, advisers James “Jim” Venditti and James Oliver joined Wells on Friday from CCO Investment Services Corp, the broker-dealer affiliated with Citizens Financial Group. The advisers manage about $110 million in client assets and generated $1.2 million in revenue last year, according to a recruiter with knowledge of the move. Wells Fargo, which also has a traditional employee broker-dealer and banking division, said in April that its independent “FiNet” channel added 70 independent practices and 152 financial advisers in 2011. As a result, the division increased its client assets under management 18 percent to $52.7 billion. While some of those teams joined Wells from existing independent practices, many were also newly independent advisers who decided to start their own businesses, which recruiters say has become an increasingly attractive option for veteran brokers. With its broker-dealer subsidiaries, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo has the third-largest U.S. brokerage by client assets after Morgan Stanley Smith Barney  and Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch.

The company said on Thursday it added 13 advisers from rival brokerages in the last three weeks, bringing its total May expansion to at least 19 experienced advisers who managed $2.3 billion in client assets. Reuters tracks the movement of individual advisers or teams that manage about $100 million or more in client assets. “With all of the changes in the industry, we felt like we needed a provider that was going to keep pace as a market leader,” said adviser Tom Krahe, who joined Wells in Richmond, Virginia, from SunTrust. “We felt that Wells had integrated a lot of the capabilities from its predecessor companies,” he said, referring to its early Wheat First Butcher Singer roots. “It has taken the best of what they had to offer and put it into a single platform.” Krahe joined Wells with fellow advisers John Taitague, Matt Tatum and Tom Doyle. The team managed $520 million in client  assets and generated $3.1 million in revenue production last year. They report to regional market manager Rob Withers. Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage unit of the San Francisco-based bank, is headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri and has more than 15,000 advisers who manage roughly $1.2 trillion in client assets among its broker-dealer subsidiaries.

480,WFC,Citi cuts price targets on U.S. banks,"(Reuters) - Regional banks’ earnings and share prices will take a hit as interest rates have fallen to record lows, analysts at Citi Investment Research & Analysis said, cutting their price targets on several lenders, including Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N). “A period of prolonged low rates is a very challenging environment for a regional bank, but it is not an immediate hit that will show up in the 2Q results, rather the impact builds over time as the balance sheet turns over,” Citi analysts said. Citi analysts cut their earnings outlook on regional banks by an average of 3 percent for 2013 and 6 percent for 2014.

482,WFC,"ON THE MOVE-Wells Fargo hires from Merrill Lynch, UBS","June 19 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Tuesday it expanded the company’s brokerage division in June with two new adviser hires from rival firms Bank of America Merrill Lynch  and UBS . The two advisers, who joined in California and Idaho, each managed $178 million in client assets at their old firms. With these additions, Wells has now added at least 14 advisers in June alone, based on moves tracked by Reuters. Those advisers managed more than $1.7 billion in client assets at their previous firms. In California, adviser Salim Kimiagar, who managed $178 million in client assets, moved to Wells Fargo’s private client group from Merrill Lynch. Kimiagar, a more than two decade industry veteran, joined Wells’ Woodland Hills office on June 6. In Idaho, adviser Bruce Davidson joined Wells’ Boise office from UBS, where he also managed $178 million in client assets and had been for roughly the past six years. He generated $1.1 million in annual revenue production last year and moved to Wells on June 4. Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage unit of the San Francisco-based bank, is headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri and has more than 15,000 advisers who manage roughly $1.2 trillion in client assets among its broker-dealer subsidiaries.

483,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Wells Fargo lands veteran Merrill Lynch broker team,"June 19 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co bolstered its independent broker force in Florida, landing a team of veteran Merrill Lynch advisers who managed $493 million in client assets at their old firm. Advisers Michael Landsberg, Lewis Bennett and Anthony Dubbaneh joined Wells on Friday from Merrill Lynch, the brokerage unit owned by Bank of America. The advisers generated a combined $4.2 million in annual revenue production last year. Landsberg, who had been at Merrill for nearly two decades, said he decided to make the move - the first in his advising career - in part because he wanted to have greater flexibility in choosing securities for his clients. “That is really valuable given the current investment climate,” he said in an interview on Tuesday, noting that the bulk of his client base is made up of retirees and physicians. “More customization is what clients crave.” Landsberg said at his new firm, he is able to buy securities he previously had in 2008 which had lost access to after Bank of America’s acquired Merrill. The advisers are the latest in a string of big broker teams joining Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, or “FiNet,” the company’s broker-dealer division catering to independent advisers who also function as business owners. Landsberg, a Barron’s Top 1000 adviser for the past three years, said he has seen many top brokers move into the independent and regional space in the past year. The team’s newly formed independent firm, the Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management Group, is based in Punta Gorda, Florida. “Our goal is to probably be more like a family office, where everyone is on the same side of the table,” Landsberg said. Wells said in April that its independent brokerage unit increased its client assets under management 18 percent to $52.7 billion in 2011, after adding 70 independent practices and 152 financial advisers last year. The company in June also added teams to FiNet in California and Connecticut that managed more than $400 million in combined client assets. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, which also has a traditional employee broker-dealer and banking division, has the third-largest U.S. brokerage by client assets after Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Merrill Lynch. The brokerage business, based in St. Louis, has more than 15,000 advisers with roughly $1.2 trillion in client assets among its brokerage subsidiaries.

489,WFC,Insight: Wells Fargo's mushrooming mortgage risk,"WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - The new center of U.S. mortgage lending is a nondescript office building in the American heartland, far from the California subprime lenders and the New York investment banks that drove the housing market into a bust. One out of every three home loans in the United States is now funded by Wells Fargo & Co, whose mortgage operation sits in a business park next door to a country club on the outskirts of Iowa’s capital city. Wells Fargo scaled back its subprime lending in 2004, well before the housing crash. That move, and the bank’s lack of exposure to investment banking and Europe, is why Wells Fargo was the one major U.S. bank to escape a ratings cut by Moody’s Investors Service this week. But former regulators and banking experts are beginning to worry that the fourth-largest U.S. bank may be becoming over-exposed to the housing market. It is adding mortgages to its books when the economy is sluggish and interest rates are near record lows, and this could be the best scenario. If the economy strengthens and rates suddenly rise, mortgages will suffer more than most other loans and the bank’s income could be clobbered. Another recession would also hurt the bank, because defaults would rise. Wells Fargo says it can manage the risk and sees no reason to stop expanding. It is hiring thousands of loan processors, underwriters, and call center employees, and investing billions of dollars in new loans and tens of millions in the infrastructure to manage them. “There’s no ceiling,” said Mike Heid, president of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. “There’s no cap on our size.” Investors have long praised Wells Fargo for sticking to traditional commercial and consumer banking while de-emphasizing riskier undertakings like credit derivatives trading. But old-fashioned banking can be risky too. By expanding so much in the mortgage industry, Wells Fargo is building a potentially dangerous concentration in one type of loan, said Mark Williams, a former U.S. Federal Reserve bank examiner who teaches at the Boston University School of Management. “What we know is that diversification is extremely important in banking,” said Williams, who wrote a 2010 book on the downfall of Lehman Brothers Holdings called “Uncontrolled Risk.” Wells Fargo’s Heid said the bank had decades of experience managing risk, and notes that it is expanding at a time when underwriting standards are strict and property values low. Its combined delinquency and foreclosure rate was 6.89 percent at the end of the first quarter, nearly half the rate at rival Bank of America Corp, according to the publication Inside Mortgage Finance. “It’s a really good book of business coming in right now,” Heid said. Aside from the risk to Wells Fargo, the mortgage growth also raises concerns that one company has become dominant in an industry that is so critical to the U.S. economy. Edward DeMarco, acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said in a speech last month that he would like to see the mortgage market become more competitive. At the same time, Wells Fargo is a key source of funding for many smaller banks, which issue mortgages and then sell them on to the company and other lenders in a practice known as correspondent lending. Smaller banks say they have fewer buyers for their mortgages than before the 2008 crisis and that the market would lose a huge source of liquidity if Wells Fargo were to pull back. “If you are a community bank and depend on Wells Fargo as a correspondent bank, you are unfortunately at their control,” said Ron Haynie, executive vice president for mortgage services at the Independent Community Bankers of America. Correspondent lending may be risky for Wells Fargo, too. It has said that loans written in-house are of better quality than those it buys from other banks, which may be why many of its rivals have backed away from correspondent lending. Still, Wells Fargo, which got 42 percent of its mortgages last year from correspondent banks, says it chooses partners carefully and has net worth and performance requirements for them. Like the rest of his executive team, Heid, a 24-year company veteran, works from a cubicle in this suburban office. He became co-president of the home mortgage division in 2004, at the same time Wells decided not to offer some of the riskier mortgages competitors were making — including subprime loans in which borrowers provided little documentation of their income. “There was a huge chunk of the market that we just consciously chose to not do,” said Heid, who became sole head of the unit in a reorganization last year. The bank’s restraint paid off. In 2008, Wells became the top mortgage lender in the United States, a position it had ceded in 2004 to Countrywide Financial, which Bank of America now owns. By 2009, the bank had nearly a quarter of the market, double its market share in 2007, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. And last year, Wells became the top collector of mortgage payments from borrowers, a business known as servicing. Wells Fargo also bulked up during the financial crisis by buying North Carolina-based Wachovia Corp in 2008. The deal brought the company a portfolio of risky adjustable-rate mortgages, which it is gradually liquidating, but also gave it a more visible presence on the U.S. East Coast. The bank is now one of the few investing in the mortgage business, while competitors are pulling back. Wells Fargo plans to add 1,000 loan officers nationally and is looking to hire hundreds of processors and underwriters, some of whom are working on a government program to refinance underwater mortgages. It is also developing new systems for underwriting. So far, that investment is paying off. In the first quarter, Wells Fargo’s mortgage income climbed 42 percent to $2.9 billion from a year earlier, about one-fourth of the bank’s fee income. Analysts expect the business to boost second-quarter earnings. Mortgages have also become a growing percentage of the bank’s assets. Wells Fargo has $312 billion in residential mortgages and home-equity loans on its books, representing about 41 percent of its loans, up from 38 percent in 2006. Among large banks, mortgages make up a slightly higher percentage of total loans at Bank of America, but significantly less at Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co and US Bancorp. Wells Fargo keeps about 10 percent of the loans it makes, and packages the rest into securities guaranteed by government-controlled entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bank has said. It sells the securities to investors. That percentage is typical of the industry, but with its size, Wells is piling on more loans than others. The worst-case scenario for Wells Fargo’s mortgage business would be a rapid rise in interest rates, analysts said. That would push up its cost of funds, while it would still be earning historically low interest on long-term mortgages, making a large slab of its loans unprofitable. In the 1980s, U.S. savings-and-loans were felled by such a rate squeeze, as well as risky investments they made, said Lawrence White, an economics professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business and a former savings and loans regulator. Wells can hedge this risk and has a much more diversified balance sheet than the savings-and-loans had, White said. But the bank and its regulators need to monitor the situation closely, he added. “We need to keep the memory (of the savings-and-loan crisis) alive because with long-lived assets, clearly an interest-rate spike can get you in trouble the old-fashioned way,” White said. But while others pull back, Wells seems to be betting that the U.S. economy and the housing market is on an upswing, or at least will not weaken too much. “If the market recovers, I think they will be sitting very pretty,” said Anthony Sanders, a finance professor at George Mason University and former head of asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities research at Deutsche Bank. “But there is always a concern. We are not out of the woods yet.” ",6222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wellsfargo-mortgages/insight-wells-fargos-mushrooming-mortgage-risk-idUSBRE85L1BE20120622

491,WFC,Wells Fargo must pay $1.2 mln to fired broker,"June 25 (Reuters) - A division of Wells Fargo & Co  must pay $1.2 million to a former broker after an arbitration panel ruled that the firm wrongfully denied him deferred compensation he had earned before he was fired for abusing the company’s email system. Six weeks before Raymond John Kowalewski was to receive a deferred compensation award, the Atlanta-based adviser was fired for sending emails containing “racial language” and forwarding “naked pictures” through Wells’ computer system, his lawyer Charles Dalziel said in an interview on Monday. Dalziel said that while several other people in the office had also sent such emails, they were not fired. Kowalewski alleged breach of contract and tortious interference with property, among other claims, in his assertion that he had the right to payments from certain awards. “There was paperwork that congratulated him for earning those at the time,” said Dalziel, referring to awards Kowalewski earned from his days at Wachovia Securities and Prudential Securities, where he had been since 1983. Wachovia merged with Prudential in 2003, and Wells acquired Wachovia in 2008. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment on the arbitration panel ruling. Wells Fargo had requested that the statement of claim “be denied in its entirety” and that all costs and attorneys’ fees be paid by Kowalewski, according to the arbitration award. The award included compensatory damages for deferred compensation programs from both Prudential and Wachovia, as well as a retention award allotted a f ter Wells’ merger. Kowalewski also received compensation for health insurance damages, but the panel denied his requests for punitive damages and attorneys’ fees.

But former regulators and banking experts are beginning to worry that the fourth-largest U.S. bank may be becoming over-exposed to the housing market. It is adding mortgages to its books when the economy is sluggish and interest rates are near record lows, and this could be the best scenario. If the economy strengthens and rates suddenly rise, mortgages will suffer more than most other loans and the bank’s income could be clobbered. Another recession would also hurt the bank, because defaults would rise. Wells Fargo says it can manage the risk and sees no reason to stop expanding. It is hiring thousands of loan processors, underwriters, and call center employees, and investing billions of dollars in new loans and tens of millions in the infrastructure to manage them. “There’s no ceiling,” said Mike Heid, president of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. “There’s no cap on our size.” Investors have long praised Wells Fargo for sticking to traditional commercial and consumer banking while de-emphasizing riskier undertakings like credit derivatives trading. But old-fashioned banking can be risky too. By expanding so much in the mortgage industry, Wells Fargo is building a potentially dangerous concentration in one type of loan, said Mark Williams, a former U.S. Federal Reserve bank examiner who teaches at the Boston University School of Management. “What we know is that diversification is extremely important in banking,” said Williams, who wrote a 2010 book on the downfall of Lehman Brothers Holdings called “Uncontrolled Risk.” Wells Fargo’s Heid said the bank had decades of experience managing risk, and notes that it is expanding at a time when underwriting standards are strict and property values low. Its combined delinquency and foreclosure rate was 6.89 percent at the end of the first quarter, nearly half the rate at rival Bank of America Corp, according to the publication Inside Mortgage Finance. “It’s a really good book of business coming in right now,” Heid said. Aside from the risk to Wells Fargo, the mortgage growth also raises concerns that one company has become dominant in an industry that is so critical to the U.S. economy. Edward DeMarco, acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said in a speech last month that he would like to see the mortgage market become more competitive. At the same time, Wells Fargo is a key source of funding for many smaller banks, which issue mortgages and then sell them on to the company and other lenders in a practice known as correspondent lending. Smaller banks say they have fewer buyers for their mortgages than before the 2008 crisis and that the market would lose a huge source of liquidity if Wells Fargo were to pull back. “If you are a community bank and depend on Wells Fargo as a correspondent bank, you are unfortunately at their control,” said Ron Haynie, executive vice president for mortgage services at the Independent Community Bankers of America. Correspondent lending may be risky for Wells Fargo, too. It has said that loans written in-house are of better quality than those it buys from other banks, which may be why many of its rivals have backed away from correspondent lending. Still, Wells Fargo, which got 42 percent of its mortgages last year from correspondent banks, says it chooses partners carefully and has net worth and performance requirements for them. Like the rest of his executive team, Heid, a 24-year company veteran, works from a cubicle in this suburban office. He became co-president of the home mortgage division in 2004, at the same time Wells decided not to offer some of the riskier mortgages competitors were making — including subprime loans in which borrowers provided little documentation of their income. “There was a huge chunk of the market that we just consciously chose to not do,” said Heid, who became sole head of the unit in a reorganization last year. The bank’s restraint paid off. In 2008, Wells became the top mortgage lender in the United States, a position it had ceded in 2004 to Countrywide Financial, which Bank of America now owns. By 2009, the bank had nearly a quarter of the market, double its market share in 2007, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. And last year, Wells became the top collector of mortgage payments from borrowers, a business known as servicing. Wells Fargo also bulked up during the financial crisis by buying North Carolina-based Wachovia Corp in 2008. The deal brought the company a portfolio of risky adjustable-rate mortgages, which it is gradually liquidating, but also gave it a more visible presence on the U.S. East Coast. The bank is now one of the few investing in the mortgage business, while competitors are pulling back. Wells Fargo plans to add 1,000 loan officers nationally and is looking to hire hundreds of processors and underwriters, some of whom are working on a government program to refinance underwater mortgages. It is also developing new systems for underwriting. So far, that investment is paying off. In the first quarter, Wells Fargo’s mortgage income climbed 42 percent to $2.9 billion from a year earlier, about one-fourth of the bank’s fee income. Analysts expect the business to boost second-quarter earnings. Mortgages have also become a growing percentage of the bank’s assets. Wells Fargo has $312 billion in residential mortgages and home-equity loans on its books, representing about 41 percent of its loans, up from 38 percent in 2006. Among large banks, mortgages make up a slightly higher percentage of total loans at Bank of America, but significantly less at Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase & Co and US Bancorp. Wells Fargo keeps about 10 percent of the loans it makes, and packages the rest into securities guaranteed by government-controlled entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bank has said. It sells the securities to investors. That percentage is typical of the industry, but with its size, Wells is piling on more loans than others. The worst-case scenario for Wells Fargo’s mortgage business would be a rapid rise in interest rates, analysts said. That would push up its cost of funds, while it would still be earning historically low interest on long-term mortgages, making a large slab of its loans unprofitable. In the 1980s, U.S. savings-and-loans were felled by such a rate squeeze, as well as risky investments they made, said Lawrence White, an economics professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business and a former savings and loans regulator. Wells can hedge this risk and has a much more diversified balance sheet than the savings-and-loans had, White said. But the bank and its regulators need to monitor the situation closely, he added. “We need to keep the memory (of the savings-and-loan crisis) alive because with long-lived assets, clearly an interest-rate spike can get you in trouble the old-fashioned way,” White said. But while others pull back, Wells seems to be betting that the U.S. economy and the housing market is on an upswing, or at least will not weaken too much. “If the market recovers, I think they will be sitting very pretty,” said Anthony Sanders, a finance professor at George Mason University and former head of asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities research at Deutsche Bank. “But there is always a concern. We are not out of the woods yet.”",6252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-mortgages/rpt-insight-wells-fargos-mushrooming-mortgage-risk-idUSL2E8HMC1P20120625
493,WFC,Wells Fargo unit in $25 million settlement,"NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - Evergreen Investment Management Company has agreed to pay $25 million to settle a class action claiming it misled investors about a now defunct mutual fund’s exposure to mortgage-backed securities. Lawyers for the investors filed papers in U.S. District Court in Boston on Friday seeking preliminary court approval of the accord with Evergreen, the former investment management business of Wachovia Corp whose funds are now managed by Wells Fargo & Co. Plaintiffs lawyers announced the settlement on  Monday. The settlement covers investors in Evergreen Ultra Short Opportunities Fund, which the plaintiffs claimed was marketed as an ultra short bond fund. The plaintiffs contended the fund was invested in illiquid and risky mortgage-backed securities. The fund was operated by Evergreen Investment Management Co, the investment management business of Wachovia, which Wells Fargo agreed to acquire in 2008. “We are particularly pleased to be able to recover on behalf of our institutional investor clients who ultimately were cheated of millions of dollars as a result of the blatant misrepresentations made by the defendants,” Stewart Cohen, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. Evergreen liquidated the fund in June 2008. By then, the fund’s assets were worth $403 million, down by $300 million from nine months earlier, according to an August 2011 court decision. Investors sued, claiming to have lost 25 percent of their investments. U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton largely denied a motion to dismiss in March 2010 and certified the investor class in August 2011. A jury trial had been set for June 4, but was canceled after the parties notified the judge on May 15 they had reached a settlement. In the court papers filed on Friday, lawyers for the plaintiffs estimated recoverable damages at $97 million. The figure did not include $33 million the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission previously obtained for shareholders in June 2009 as part of a $40 million settlement. Evergreen and Wachovia continue to “deny each and all of the claims alleged by” the plaintiffs, according to Friday’s motion. Laura Fay, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, in a statement emphasized that the events in the lawsuit predated Wells Fargo’s acquisition of Wachovia. Wells Fargo’s “policies and procedures, and conservative approach to risk management, have led the firm to successfully avoid the regulatory challenges experienced by many firms in the mutual fund industry,” she added. The case is In Re Evergreen Ultra Short Opportunities Fund Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court of the District of Massachusetts, 08-cv-11064.

495,WFC,UPDATE 4-Wells Fargo to pay $175 mln in race discrimination probe,"* U.S.: African-Americans, Hispanics steered into higher-priced loans * Bank will pay $125 million to compensate borrowers * Another $50 million will go to eight U.S. metro areas By Rick Rothacker and David Ingram CHARLOTTE, N.C./WASHINGTON, July 12 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co agreed to pay $175 million to resolve allegations it charged African-Americans and Hispanics higher rates and fees on mortgages even when they qualified for better deals during the housing boom, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday. The settlement is the latest in the Obama administration’s effort to eliminate discriminatory lending practices, which contributed to high mortgage default rates in many poor neighborhoods when the housing bubble burst. In its consent order with the government, Wells Fargo said it treated all its customers fairly and without regard to race and national origin. The bank said in a statement it was settling the matter “solely for the purpose of avoiding contested litigation” with the U.S. Justice Department. Wells Fargo now funds one out of every three mortgages in the United States. A government investigation found 34,000 instances of Wells Fargo charging African Americans and Hispanics higher fees and rates on mortgages compared with white borrowers with similar credit profiles, according to documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. In 4,000 of those cases, minority borrowers were steered into subprime mortgages even though they qualified for cheaper loans. “This a case about real people, African-American and Latino, who suffered real harm as a result of Wells Fargo’s discriminatory lending practices,” Thomas Perez, U.S. assistant attorney general for civil rights, said at a news conference in Washington. “People with similar qualifications should be treated similarly. They should be judged by the content of their credit worthiness and not the color of their skin,” Perez said, referring to Martin Luther King Jr’s “I Have A Dream” speech. In the second-largest settlement of its kind, the biggest U.S. mortgage lender will pay $125 million to borrowers who were allegedly charged more than their white counterparts between 2004 and 2009. Wells Fargo will also contribute $50 million to homebuyer assistance programs in eight metropolitan areas around the country. The government identified those areas needing the most help in recovering from the housing crisis. Bank of America Corp’s Countrywide Financial unit agreed in December to pay a record $335 million to settle similar charges. Wells Fargo’s settlement needs approval from a judge.  The government’s probe focused on loans made through brokers. About 5 percent of the bank’s loans are currently made through brokers. The bank will still process and close loan applications it has already received from mortgage brokers. But rivals such as Bank of America have already stopped lending through brokers, a practice that gives banks less control over what borrowers are told about loans. “These loans are being originated under our name,” Wells spokesman Oscar Suris said. “If we can’t control the customer experience, we are going to get out of it.” Wells Fargo will continue a practice that also leaves it with less control over what the borrower is told: correspondent lending, where a smaller bank makes a loan and then sells it to the bank. In the next step in the case, Wells Fargo has agreed to conduct a review of loans it made directly to customers and will compensate African-American and Hispanic borrowers who were placed into subprime loans when similarly qualified borrowers received prime loans. Perez said he expected 3,000 to 4,000 more victims will be found in this review. The bank will also be required to conduct new monitoring programs to ensure fair lending standards are in place in the future. “It’s taken a long time, but the remedies they have put in place ought to ensure that anybody who is getting a loan from Wells Fargo is getting a good deal that’s not gouging them with any additional fees,” said Shanna Smith, president of the National Fair Housing Alliance. Wells Fargo declined to say whether it has already set aside reserves for the settlement. The bank reports second-quarter earnings on Friday. The settlement with the Department of Justice also resolves pending litigation filed in 2009 by the State of Illinois on behalf of borrowers, and resolves an investigative complaint filed in 2010 by the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission. Wells Fargo also resolved a lawsuit filed by the city of Baltimore in 2008 alleging the bank engaged in “reverse redlining,” or intentionally targeting minority communities for predatory mortgage loans, leading to high foreclosures in minority neighborhoods. U.S. banks historically refrained from making any loans in many minority neighborhoods, a practice known as “redlining.” The bank will spend $4.5 million of the $50 million in Baltimore. It will also pay an additional $3 million for local housing and foreclosure initiatives and set a five-year lending goal for the city. In return, Baltimore will drop its suit. Wells reached a similar agreement in May with the city of Memphis, which had also filed a reverse redlining lawsuit. In 2009, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency referred the Wells Fargo case to the Justice Department, whose civil rights division took it on. Perez, the U.S. assistant attorney general, gave examples of how the alleged discrimination played out. In one instance, an African-American customer in the Chicago area in 2007 seeking a $300,000 loan paid on average $2,937 more in fees than a similarly qualified white applicant. In another example, a Latino borrower in the Miami area in 2007 seeking a $300,000 loan paid on average $2,538 more in fees than a similarly qualified white applicant.

497,WFC,Stern Advice - Will the Wells Fargo settlement affect your mortgage?,"WASHINGTON, July 12 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co  agreed to pay $175 million to resolve allegations by the U.S. Justice Department that it discriminated against qualified African-American and Hispanic borrowers in its mortgage lending. At the same time, the bank said it would stop making loans through mortgage brokers, who the government said submitted loans to Wells Fargo that had varied interest rates, fees and costs based only on race and not correlated to the borrowers’ creditworthiness. There are a lot of pieces to that, and borrowers - especially those who are in the midst of getting new Wells Fargo mortgages - may wonder what it means for them. Not all of the answers are evident yet, but here are a few. — I’m in the middle of refinancing with Wells. Now what? If you’ve already filed your application with a mortgage broker, your loan should go through as planned. Wells said it would stop taking new broker applications on Friday, July 13. Mortgages already in the pipeline are expected to go through. — Will this make it harder to get a mortgage in the future? Many experts, especially those who value the brokerage process, say it will. Bank of America, Citi and JPMorgan Chase have all stopped doing mortgage loans through brokers, and the theory is that the fewer outlets brokers have, the more business they will squeeze into fewer companies. “This is going to force the same amount of lending through a smaller opening” says Rob Chrisman, a mortgage industry analyst in San Rafael, California. “It will impact the borrower in the form of higher rates or worse prices or a longer wait time to get the loan.” But with mortgage interest rates flirting with historic lows, getting a mortgage is already a slow and difficult process and this won’t make it worse, suggested Donald J. Frommeyer, president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers and an Indianapolis mortgage broker. “Things have been tightening up for the last 12 months.” Consumers can comparison shop for their own loans, either by checking individual lenders or shopping through an aggregation websites like HSH Associates () or Mortgage Marvel (). But Chrisman pointed out that individuals may not have the pull to fast track their mortgages the way a broker handling large numbers of loans can. — I think I was one of the victims here. Will I get money, and when? Wells has agreed to pay $125 million to borrowers who paid more for their loans than comparable white borrowers. A judge must still approve the settlement. After that, money should flow quickly, says Sam Garcia, publisher of Mortgage Daily, a trade publication. The government must name a settlement administrator within 60 days, provide that person with a list of borrowers due settlement funds. At that point, the administrator will have six months to complete all payments. Wells Fargo has already provided the government with a list of potentially affected borrowers (those who took out loans between 2004 and 2009). As is typical in settlement cases, there will be a special website and phone number set up, but it isn’t ready yet. — I didn’t borrow money yet, but I’d like to buy a house. Is there anything here for me? Wells is also paying $50 million to set up a Wells Fargo Borrower Assistance Program of down payment help for borrowers in areas that the Justice Department had highlighted as having many discrimination victims. Those areas include Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Oakland, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Those funds will be given out as forgiveable loans maxing out at $15,000. Their interest rates will be 0 percent, and 20 percent of the loan will be forgiven every year, explained Garcia. To qualify, borrowers have to earn less than 120 percent of the area median income, and they don’t have to use a Wells Fargo mortgage. — Am I getting a fair rate now? In settling the complaints, Wells did not admit to any prejudicial lending. But the Justice Department had alleged African-American and Latino borrowers were being steered to subprime mortgages carrying higher rates. One way to check your rates is to get a copy of your credit score at the Fico web site (). You’ll learn whether you have an excellent, mediocre, or subprime score. Then you can get comparison quotes, based on your credit score, at many online banks and brokers. Don’t agree to any mortgage without comparison shopping rates elsewhere.

499,WFC,"JPMorgan, Wells results boosted by mortgage business","(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) reported strong growth in their mortgage lending businesses and lower loan losses on Friday, offering signs of improvement in the U.S. economy. The banking giants cited increases in mortgage originations and a strong pipeline of applications, spurred by low interest rates and a government program intended to spur refinancing. The performance of JPMorgan’s core businesses helped offset a $4.4 billion trading loss in its Chief Investment Office, relieving investors who worried about the impact of the embarrassing “London Whale trades” on the bank’s bottom line. The two banks’ results boosted their shares and helped U.S. stock indexes rally at the end of a down week. Wells, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, and JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, also said charge-offs for bad loans declined while demand for new debt, ranging from auto loans to commercial loans, increased. But the mortgage business was a particularly bright spot for both banks. “We’ve seen increases in sales and pricing in markets throughout the country, even in some of the hardest-hit areas during the downturn,” said Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf. Wells reported a 17 percent increase in quarterly profit, as mortgage originations more than doubled from a year ago, to $131 billion. The bank also cited record quarterly applications, and said it had 29 percent more unclosed loans in its pipeline than at the end of the previous quarter. “The standout I’m seeing with Wells Fargo is the mortgage banking,” said Shannon Stemm, a banking analyst with Edward Jones. “That has been such a driver for them over the long term, and refinancing is really pumping things up.” The San Francisco-based bank posted mortgage banking income of $2.9 billion, up from $1.6 billion a year ago and up slightly from the first quarter. The gains came in spite of higher loss provisions for bad mortgages Wells Fargo may be asked to repurchase from investors. The bank also set aside reserves for a $175 million settlement to resolve Justice Department allegations that it charged African-Americans and Hispanics higher rates and fees on mortgages during the housing boom. JPMorgan’s overall profits declined because of huge losses on risky derivatives trades in its investment division. But net income from the bank’s retail financial services business, which includes mortgages, nearly quintupled to $2.3 billion. JPMorgan’s mortgage banking originations rose 29 percent, with its mortgage production and servicing business reporting net income of $604 million, compared with a net loss of $649 million a year earlier. Other indicators of loan demand, including credit card sales volumes, commercial banking loan growth and loan charge-offs, also showed improvement. JPMorgan set aside $214 million for credit losses, compared with $1.8 billion a year ago. Asked by an analyst about the “disconnect” between JPMorgan’s underlying loan growth trends and negative economic news, CEO Jamie Dimon said U.S. companies are faring relatively well. “The fact is the underpinnings of the American economy aren’t that bad,” Dimon said. “Corporate America, middle market companies, small business are OK, a lot of liquidity. There’s not a huge order book so sales aren’t growing dramatically. We have slow, modest growth.” Wells Fargo said it would not meet a previously stated cost-cutting target for the fourth quarter because it must pay more compensation than expected due to higher revenues, particularly in its mortgage business. The bank added more than 2,000 employees during the quarter as it scrambled to capture more loans. “We will not pass up revenue opportunities in order to meet a specific expense target number,” said Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan. The bank previously said it expected expenses to fall to $11.25 billion by the fourth quarter as part of an efficiency push. On Friday, Wells said it would miss that target even though expenses would continue to trend down. In the wake of its Justice Department settlement, Wells on Thursday said it would stop making mortgages through independent brokers, the source of many of the loans that came under scrutiny. Those mortgages account for 5 percent of the bank’s volume, but the decision “won’t have a significant impact on our earnings,” Sloan said in an interview. The settlement won’t require any big changes in how the bank operates, Sloan said. “We don’t think we’ve got a fair lending problem, but we thought it made sense to settle,” he said. Overall, Wells Fargo said second-quarter net income was $4.6 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $3.9 billion, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts’ average estimate was 81 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings benefited from the release of $400 million in reserves previously set aside for loan losses. Revenue was $21.3 billion, up from $20.4 billion a year ago. Expenses totaled $12.4 billion, down slightly from a year earlier. Wells Fargo’s total loans increased by $8.7 billion from the first quarter to $775.2 billion, boosted mostly by $6.9 billion in business and foreign loans acquired from BNP Paribas and WestLB.

500,WFC,"WRAPUP 3-JPMorgan, Wells results boosted by mortgage business","* JPMorgan, Wells Fargo report strong mortgage demand * Refinancing activity spurs new originations, applications * JPMorgan’s Dimon: U.S. companies faring relatively well * JPMorgan results relieve investor anxiety over “London Whale” losses * Shares in JPMorgan, Wells Fargo rise, helping lift stock markets By Rick Rothacker and Lauren Tara LaCapra July 13 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co reported strong growth in their mortgage lending businesses and lower loan losses on Friday, offering signs of improvement in the U.S. economy. The banking giants cited increases in mortgage originations and a strong pipeline of applications, spurred by low interest rates and a government program intended to spur refinancing. The performance of JPMorgan’s core businesses helped offset a $4.4 billion trading loss in its Chief Investment Office, relieving investors who worried about the impact of the embarrassing “London Whale trades” on the bank’s bottom line. The two banks’ results boosted their shares and helped U.S. stock indexes rally at the end of a down week. Wells, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, and JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, also said charge-offs for bad loans declined while demand for new debt, ranging from auto loans to commercial loans, increased. But the mortgage business was a particularly bright spot for both banks. “We’ve seen increases in sales and pricing in markets throughout the country, even in some of the hardest-hit areas during the downturn,” said Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf. Wells reported a 17 percent increase in quarterly profit, as mortgage originations more than doubled from a year ago, to $131 billion. The bank also cited record quarterly applications, and said it had 29 percent more unclosed loans in its pipeline than at the end of the previous quarter. “The standout I’m seeing with Wells Fargo is the mortgage banking,” said Shannon Stemm, a banking analyst with Edward Jones. “That has been such a driver for them over the long term,  and refinancing is really pumping things up.” The San Francisco-based bank posted mortgage banking income of $2.9 billion, up from $1.6 billion a year ago and up slightly from the first quarter. The gains came in spite of higher loss provisions for bad mortgages Wells Fargo may be asked to repurchase from investors. The bank also set aside reserves for a $175 million settlement to resolve Justice Department allegations that it charged African-Americans and Hispanics higher rates and fees on mortgages during the housing boom. JPMorgan’s overall profits declined because of huge losses on risky derivatives trades in its investment division. But net income from the bank’s retail financial services business, which includes mortgages, nearly quintupled to $2.3 billion. JPMorgan’s mortgage banking originations rose 29 percent, with its mortgage production and servicing business reporting net income of $604 million, compared with a net loss of $649 million a year earlier. Other indicators of loan demand, including credit card sales volumes, commercial banking loan growth and loan charge-offs, also showed improvement. JPMorgan set aside $214 million for credit losses, compared with $1.8 billion a year ago. Asked by an analyst about the “disconnect” between JPMorgan’s underlying loan growth trends and negative economic news, CEO Jamie Dimon said U.S. companies are faring relatively well. “The fact is the underpinnings of the American economy aren’t that bad,” Dimon said. “Corporate America, middle market companies, small business are OK, a lot of liquidity. There’s not a huge order book so sales aren’t growing dramatically. We have slow, modest growth.” Wells Fargo said it would not meet a previously stated cost-cutting target for the fourth quarter because it must pay more compensation than expected due to higher revenues, particularly in its mortgage business. The bank added more than 2,000 employees during the quarter as it scrambled to capture more loans. “We will not pass up revenue opportunities in order to meet a specific expense target number,” said Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan. The bank previously said it expected expenses to fall to $11.25 billion by the fourth quarter as part of an efficiency push. On Friday, Wells said it would miss that target even though expenses would continue to trend down. In the wake of its Justice Department settlement, Wells on Thursday said it would stop making mortgages through independent brokers, the source of many of the loans that came under scrutiny. Those mortgages account for 5 percent of the bank’s volume, but the decision “won’t have a significant impact on our earnings,” Sloan said in an interview. The settlement won’t require any big changes in how the bank operates, Sloan said. “We don’t think we’ve got a fair lending problem, but we thought it made sense to settle,” he said. Overall, Wells Fargo said second-quarter net income was $4.6 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $3.9 billion, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts’ average estimate was 81 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings benefited from the release of $400 million in reserves previously set aside for loan losses. Revenue was $21.3 billion, up from $20.4 billion a year ago. Expenses totaled $12.4 billion, down slightly from a year earlier. Wells Fargo’s total loans increased by $8.7 billion from the first quarter to $775.2 billion, boosted mostly by $6.9 billion in business and foreign loans acquired from BNP Paribas and WestLB. In the past year, the bank has been active in buying portfolios from retrenching banks that are selling assets to boost capital.

501,WFC,TEXT-S&P; says Wells Fargo & Co ratings unaffected by Q2 results,"July 13 - Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services today said its ratings on Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC; A+/Negative/A-1) are unaffected by the company’s good second-quarter results.  WFC generated $7.1 billion in pretax income, up 16.8% year over year.  Second-quarter results benefited from good mortgage performance, which we  expect to continue into the third quarter, and a $400 million reserve release,  which is the same as last quarter. The reserve release in the second quarter  was higher than our expectations. Pretax preprovision earnings totaled $8.9  billion in the second quarter—up from $7.9 billion in second-quarter 2011. We  believe expense reduction is on track. The efficiency ratio was 58.2% in the  quarter, compared with 61.2% in the second quarter of 2011. The company’s  efficiency ratio goal is 55%-59%. The completion of the Wachovia Corp.  integration aids cost-reduction metrics because incremental costs are now  eliminated.   The net interest margin (NIM) held steady at 3.91%, again exceeding  expectations, as a result, in part, of increased Purchase Credit Impaired  (PCI) portfolio loan resolution income, which increased NIM by 7 basis points  (bps). In future quarters, we expect a weaker NIM until rates begin to rise.  Credit quality continues to improve, but the rate of improvement is moderating  as losses return to normal. The net charge-off ratio declined for the ninth  consecutive quarter to 1.15% from last quarter’s 1.25%, and a provision of  $1.8 billion was the same as the second-quarter 2011. Reported total  nonperforming assets were down slightly to 3.2% from 3.5%. Although the PCI  portfolio could still pose incremental credit risk in the event of an economic  downturn, it continues to perform better than our expectations.  Core loans were up 2.1% in the second quarter from the first quarter because  of acquisitions, including energy loans from BNP Paribas, and from growth in  consumer lending. We expect WFC to continue to look for acquisitions to boost  loan growth. Average core deposits increased 9% for the year and 5%  (annualized) for the quarter.  Estimated Tier 1 common equity increased 10 bps to 10.08% during the quarter  and 93 bps from a year ago. The company reported an estimated Basel III Tier 1  common ratio of 7.78%, down 3 bps from last quarter, reflecting new regulatory  guidance under the Fed’s Notices of Proposed Rulemaking on the implementation  of Basel III. Over time, we believe that WFC will continue to increase capital  in anticipation of Basel III while also prudently returning capital to  shareholders. In addition to the regular dividend, the company repurchased 64  million shares (including a forward purchase agreement) and redeemed $1.8  billion in higher coupon trust preferred securities.   The negative outlook on WFC reflects the outlook on the U.S. sovereign rating  given the extraordinary government support we incorporate into our issuer  credit rating on WFC. If we were to lower the U.S. sovereign rating by one  notch to ‘AA’, we would also lower the issuer credit rating on WFC because we  would remove the one notch of support we currently factor into the rating.  Similarly, we could revise our outlook on WFC to stable if we were to revise  our outlook on the U.S. sovereign rating to stable. Otherwise, WFC’s  fundamental credit trends are stable.",7132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA106820120713

505,WFC,Will the Wells Fargo settlement affect your mortgage?,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co agreed to pay $175 million to resolve allegations by the U.S. Justice Department that it discriminated against qualified African-American and Hispanic borrowers in its mortgage lending. At the same time, the bank said it would stop making loans through mortgage brokers, who the government said submitted loans to Wells Fargo that had varied interest rates, fees and costs based only on race and not correlated to the borrowers’ creditworthiness. There are a lot of pieces to that, and borrowers - especially those who are in the midst of getting new Wells Fargo mortgages - may wonder what it means for them. Not all of the answers are evident yet, but here are a few. — I’m in the middle of refinancing with Wells. Now what? If you’ve already filed your application with a mortgage broker, your loan should go through as planned. Wells said it would stop taking new broker applications on Friday, July 13. Mortgages already in the pipeline are expected to go through. — Will this make it harder to get a mortgage in the future? Many experts, especially those who value the brokerage process, say it will. Bank of America, Citi and JPMorgan Chase have all stopped doing mortgage loans through brokers, and the theory is that the fewer outlets brokers have, the more business they will squeeze into fewer companies. “This is going to force the same amount of lending through a smaller opening” says Rob Chrisman, a mortgage industry analyst in San Rafael, California. “It will impact the borrower in the form of higher rates or worse prices or a longer wait time to get the loan.” But with mortgage interest rates flirting with historic lows, getting a mortgage is already a slow and difficult process and this won’t make it worse, suggested Donald J. Frommeyer, president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers and an Indianapolis mortgage broker. “Things have been tightening up for the last 12 months.” Consumers can comparison shop for their own loans, either by checking individual lenders or shopping through an aggregation websites like HSH Associates (www.hsh.com) or Mortgage Marvel (www.mortgagemarvel.com). But Chrisman pointed out that individuals may not have the pull to fast track their mortgages the way a broker handling large numbers of loans can. — I think I was one of the victims here. Will I get money, and when? Wells has agreed to pay $125 million to borrowers who paid more for their loans than comparable white borrowers. A judge must still approve the settlement. After that, money should flow quickly, says Sam Garcia, publisher of Mortgage Daily, a trade publication. The government must name a settlement administrator within 60 days, provide that person with a list of borrowers due settlement funds. At that point, the administrator will have six months to complete all payments. Wells Fargo has already provided the government with a list of potentially affected borrowers (those who took out loans between 2004 and 2009). As is typical in settlement cases, there will be a special website and phone number set up, but it isn’t ready yet. — I didn’t borrow money yet, but I’d like to buy a house. Is there anything here for me? Wells is also paying $50 million to set up a Wells Fargo Borrower Assistance Program of down payment help for borrowers in areas that the Justice Department had highlighted as having many discrimination victims. Those areas include Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Oakland, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Those funds will be given out as forgivable loans maxing out at $15,000. Their interest rates will be 0 percent, and 20 percent of the loan will be forgiven every year, explained Garcia. To qualify, borrowers have to earn less than 120 percent of the area median income, and they don’t have to use a Wells Fargo mortgage. — Am I getting a fair rate now? In settling the complaints, Wells did not admit to any prejudicial lending. But the Justice Department had alleged African-American and Latino borrowers were being steered to subprime mortgages carrying higher rates. One way to check your rates is to get a copy of your credit score at the Fico web site (www.myfico.com). You'll learn whether you have an excellent, mediocre, or subprime score. Then you can get comparison quotes, based on your credit score, at many online banks and brokers. Don't agree to any mortgage without comparison shopping rates elsewhere.

As is typical in settlement cases, there will be a special website and phone number set up, but it isn’t ready yet. — I didn’t borrow money yet, but I’d like to buy a house. Is there anything here for me? Wells is also paying $50 million to set up a Wells Fargo Borrower Assistance Program of down payment help for borrowers in areas that the Justice Department had highlighted as having many discrimination victims. Those areas include Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Oakland, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Those funds will be given out as forgiveable loans maxing out at $15,000. Their interest rates will be 0 percent, and 20 percent of the loan will be forgiven every year, explained Garcia. To qualify, borrowers have to earn less than 120 percent of the area median income, and they don’t have to use a Wells Fargo mortgage. — Am I getting a fair rate now? In settling the complaints, Wells did not admit to any prejudicial lending. But the Justice Department had alleged African-American and Latino borrowers were being steered to subprime mortgages carrying higher rates. One way to check your rates is to get a copy of your credit score at the Fico web site (). You’ll learn whether you have an excellent, mediocre, or subprime score. Then you can get comparison quotes, based on your credit score, at many online banks and brokers. Don’t agree to any mortgage without comparison shopping rates elsewhere.

507,WFC,TEXT-Fitch affirms Wells Fargo & Company; Outlook Stable,"Ratings Sensitivity Given WFC’s ratings at already at the top of the U.S. rated universe, Fitch  views limited potential for a ratings upgrade. However, WFC’s ratings might be  reviewed if the capital implications related to the MSR asset become outsized  relative to peers under Basel III. Further, failure to lessen the mortgage  concentration could pressure WFC’s ratings over time. Large scale reforms in the  mortgage industry would also likely prompt a review of WFC’s ratings. In addition, failure to maintain earnings at current levels would likely  pressure WFC’s ratings. Much of the rating support for maintaining WFC at their  current levels is premised on WFC’s strong core earnings profile. It is the  strength of the earnings stream that provides for solid capital generation  capabilities, which will help to absorb unexpected losses.

508,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Wells bolsters indy broker unit with veteran teams,"July 20 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co added two veteran adviser teams to its independent brokerage division in late June, bolstering its broker force in New Jersey and New York. The advisers, who managed a total of $379 million in client assets at their old firms, came from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, Oppenheimer & Co and RBC Wealth Management. They joined Wells’ retail brokerage firm as independent advisers. “When you run an independent practice, you can look out for the best interests of your clients,” said Steven Dichter, who moved from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney with his partner Philip Pappas in Melville, New York. “We liked the fact that we can be independent but with a household name.” Dichter and Pappas joined Wells as an independent team and now run their own practice. The advisers spent six years at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, the brokerage owned jointly by Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, where they managed $204 million in client assets at the firm. The pair generated $1.2 million in annual revenue last year. Also on the move, advisers Jack Wiener and David Hammer joined Wells as a team in Florham Park, New Jersey, where they opened Florham Park Wealth Advisors, LLC, an independent practice affiliated with Wells. Wiener had been an adviser at RBC Wealth Management, a division of the Royal Bank of Canada , while Hammer had been an adviser at Oppenheimer & Co. The two advisers managed $175 million in client assets and generated $1 million in annual revenue last year. “Independence is really picking up,” said Wiener, a two-decade industry veteran. “I feel much more connected to my clients... It’s your own practice, nobody is going to call and go after your clients and you don’t have to worry about what the company wants you to sell,” he said. The move of veteran advisers into the independent space has been a boon for Wells Fargo’s independent brokerage division, known as Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, or “FiNet,” which caters to advisers who open their own practice and also function as business owners. More than half of the roughly $2 billion in client assets managed by advisers joining Wells in June came from those joining FiNet, based on moves tracked by Reuters. Wells also added independent adviser practices in California, Connecticut and Florida in June. The company now has more than 530 practices across the United States included in its independent brokerage unit. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, which also has a traditional employee broker-dealer and banking division, has the third-largest U.S. brokerage by client assets after Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch. The brokerage business, based in St. Louis, has more than 15,000 advisers with roughly $1.2 trillion in client assets among its brokerage subsidiaries. Roughly $52.7 billion of those assets come from its independent unit.",7202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo/on-the-move-wells-bolsters-indy-broker-unit-with-veteran-teams-idUSL2E8IJDYR20120720
509,WFC,RPT-U.S. banks haunted by mortgage demons that won't go away,"* Banks under increasing pressure to buy back bad loans * Banks say Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae getting more aggressive * Bank of America faces biggest possible losses By Rick Rothacker July 20 (Reuters) - Lenders like Bank of America Corp  and Wells Fargo & Co say they are facing mounting pressure to buy back bad mortgages they sold to investors, signaling that banks’ home-loan headaches could continue for years. Investors like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  have been pressing banks to buy back bad mortgages for years, but in recent months those requests have intensified, the banks have said in recent second-quarter earnings reports. These comments from banks provide a fresh reminder of the loose ends that remain from the housing bust that started five years ago. The threat of new expenses and litigation is dampening bank share prices, and the problem could linger for some time, analysts and experts said. “This is not done yet,” said Paul Miller, analyst with FBR Capital Markets. “There will be continued surprises in the industry.” The most pain will likely be felt by Bank of America, which said on Wednesday its total outstanding claims from investors surged more than 40 percent to about $22 billion in the second quarter. The bank’s shares fell nearly 5 percent as investors worried about future losses and dropped again on Thursday. At a time of low interest rates, U.S. banks are making many new loans to borrowers buying homes and refinancing, but anxiety about the costs of old loans is overshadowing some of this success. During the housing boom in the last decade, banks parceled  billions of dollars of loans into highly-structured   residential mortgage-backed securities they then sold off to investors. The buyers of these loans included the now-government controlled agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as private investors. When selling the mortgages, banks made promises or “representations and warranties” about the loans. Investors can ask banks to buy back soured mortgages if these promises were evidently broken, for reasons such as poor underwriting, insufficient verification of income or other documentation errors. Banks have fought some of these claims, but most lenders still expect to have to buy back many of the mortgages. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank, faces the biggest threat from repurchase requests because in 2008 it bought subprime lender Countrywide Financial, a major producer of toxic loans during the housing boom. Its mortgage unit has posted more than $30 billion of losses since the beginning of 2010. About half of the bank’s claims are from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were placed in government conservatorship in 2008 as their loan losses ballooned. Tensions are so high between Bank of America and Fannie Mae that the bank stopped selling some loans to the agency in February. According to a securities filing, Bank of America had the most outstanding repurchase requests with Fannie as of March 31 - $7.1 billion, or 58 percent of outstanding claims. The bank, in its earnings presentation, said Fannie Mae’s repurchase standards have been changing and differ from the bank’s interpretation of its contracts. The bank, for example,  has noted an increase in claims on loans in which the borrowers have made payments for at least two years. Bank of America argues that when borrowers have made payments for two years or more, it is hard to fault the bank’s underwriting instead of, for example, the state of the economy. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said they are looking out for U.S. taxpayers in making their claims. Fannie, for example, has said it may need more funds from the U.S. Treasury if it collects less than expected from Bank of America. “Under our contracts, lenders are required to repurchase loans that are delivered to Fannie Mae but do not meet our standards,” Fannie spokesman Andrew Wilson said. “We pursue repurchases in order to minimize losses and protect the interest of taxpayers.” Freddie Mac doesn’t think taxpayers should have to pay for ineligible loans sold to the agency, said spokesman Michael Cosgrove. The top three reasons for Freddie claims against banks are problems with borrowers’ income, loans that don’t meet the bank’s automated underwriting standards and problems with collateral or appraisals, he said. Freddie does not disclose claims by each bank. Banks, including Wells Fargo and PNC Financial Services Group Inc said they expect to have to pay investors more than they previously thought, and they set aside additional funds to cover the requests. Fifth Third Bancorp on Thursday said it expects claims to increase later this year. Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, set aside $669 million to cover repurchases, up from $242 million a year ago when it posted second quarter earnings last week. “We want to make sure that we have got that reserve absolutely accrued for appropriately,” Wells Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said in a conference call with analysts. “We saw the agencies continuing to adjust their requests.” PNC added $438 million to its reserves, up from $21 million a year ago. Bucking the trend was JPMorgan Chase & Co, which said claims had reached an “inflection point” and were declining. In addition to a jump in requests from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Bank of America said it is getting more claims from private investors who want to meet statute of limitations requirements. These claimants weren’t part of an $8.5 billion settlement the bank reached last year with major institutional investors. For the second quarter, Bank of America added $395 million to its repurchase reserves, which was more than the first quarter but way down from the $14 billion it set aside a year ago to cover the $8.5 billion settlement and other repurchase requests. The bank now has about $16 billion in reserves to cover these claims, but FBR Capital Markets analyst Paul Miller wrote in a research note on Wednesday that the bank may not be putting enough aside to cover its future losses. Bank officials later called him to argue that they have sufficient reserves, he said. The bank gave him a very strong argument, but he hasn’t changed his mind, Miller said. “I have my opinion. They have their opinion,” he said. Bank spokesman Jerry Dubrowksi said the bank’s calculations take into account the fact that collateral backs about half of its $22 billion in outstanding claims. In addition, the bank has historically paid out 8 to 12 cents on the dollar for the remaining balance for settlements with private investors, he said. The bank on Wednesday said it is not possible to “reasonably” estimate the possible losses to Freddie Mac and Fannie. It did not change its estimate that losses to private investors could cost $5 billion more than existing reserves. “We have significant reserves to handle potential representations and warranties claims,” Dubrowski said. Industrywide, repurchase requests may be near their peak, but are likely to remain a concern for at least another year or two, said Cliff Rossi, a teaching fellow at the University of Maryland’s business school and a former bank executive. “We are certainly not through it,” he said. “It’s another thing to give uncertainty to investors.”",7202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/mortgages-repurchase/rpt-u-s-banks-haunted-by-mortgage-demons-that-wont-go-away-idUSL2E8IK04O20120720

512,WFC,"BofA, Wells Fargo rolling out new mobile banking services","(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) are rolling out more retail services accessed by mobile phones, including check deposits, as the banking sector races to cut costs in a tepid economy. Starting Thursday, Bank of America will allow customers to make deposits by submitting a photo of a check through their smart phones, the bank’s online and mobile banking executive, Aditya Bhasin, said on Monday. The No. 2 U.S. bank is also rolling out a service allowing customers to send money to other individuals using their email address or mobile numbers, as well as expanding a coupon service that can be used by mobile customers. Wells Fargo launched its mobile check deposit service earlier this year and will gradually expand it across the United States by the end of the year, said Brian Pearce, head of the retail mobile channel at the bank. Earlier this year, the No. 4 U.S. bank launched its money transfer service, which is part of a joint venture between Wells, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) called clearXchange. The latest roll-outs mean two of the largest U.S. banks are adding mobile banking services that are increasingly popular with consumers. Combined, Bank of America and Wells Fargo have nearly 20 million active mobile banking users across the United States. Executives at both banks stress they are focused on evolving customer needs, but banks for decades have also been looking to cut costs by moving transactions to ATMs, online banking sites and now mobile devices. Banks are hoping new mobile services will eventually cost less than handling transactions in branches, even if there are high upfront costs, said Peter Olynick, card and payments leader at Carlisle & Gallagher Consulting Group. Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan has said that increasing mobile use can help the bank scale back on branches and therefore cut costs. “It is just a much more efficient and frankly strong service model,” he said during the bank’s second-quarter earnings conference call last week. The bank previously said it plans to eliminate 750 branches over the next few years and, in the past year, it has quietly shed about 9 percent of its ATMs. The bank now has about 5,600 branches and 16,200 ATMs. Bank of America spokeswoman Tara Burke said the bank’s ATM numbers declined as it removed machines at Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) malls and in Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) convenience stores. Many of these locations did not allow for check deposits or have 24-hour access, she said. While the bank’s ATM numbers are shrinking, its total active mobile users increased by about 600,000 to 10.3 million in the second quarter of this year from the first quarter. Mobile payments can also help Bank of America defend its business from non-bank rivals such as eBay Inc’s (EBAY.O) PayPal Inc, which are increasingly encroaching on banks’ payments businesses, including person-to-person transactions, Carlisle & Gallagher’s Olynick said. “The banks that are not as aggressive are at risk to other entrants and other banks that are going aggressively after this,” Olynick said. Rivals JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup Inc (C.N), for example, already offer the check deposit service. “Mobile deposit capture has been really positively received,” said Beth Robertson, director of payments research at consulting firm Javelin Strategy & Research. “It makes things so much easier for consumers and small business.” Banks are keen to defend their position in the payments processing business, which can generate big revenue for them. Banks make about $14 billion of annual fees from processing debit cards for merchants, Javelin estimates. Credit cards are even more lucrative, with interchange fees paid in 2011 by merchants to Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) banks coming in at $22.75 billion, according to industry publication The Nilson Report. In another service available for mobile customers, Bank of America is expanding a coupon program that allows customers to receive discounts from retailers by clicking on offers sent directly to their online banking accounts. The bank began testing BankAmeriDeals in January and is now making it available across the United States by early August, Bhasin said.

513,WFC,"BofA, Wells Fargo rolling out new mobile banking services","July 23 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co are rolling out more retail services accessed by mobile phones, including check deposits, as the banking sector races to cut costs in a tepid economy. Starting Thursday, Bank of America will allow customers to make deposits by submitting a photo of a check through their smart phones, the bank’s online and mobile banking executive, Aditya Bhasin, said on Monday. The No. 2 U.S. bank is also rolling out a service allowing customers to send money to other individuals using their email address or mobile numbers, as well as expanding a coupon service that can be used by mobile customers. Wells Fargo launched its mobile check deposit service earlier this year and will gradually expand it across the United States by the end of the year, said Brian Pearce, head of the retail mobile channel at the bank. Earlier this year, the No. 4 U.S. bank launched its money transfer service, which is part of a joint venture between Wells, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase & Co called clearXchange. The latest roll-outs mean two of the largest U.S. banks are adding mobile banking services that are increasingly popular with consumers. Combined, Bank of America and Wells Fargo have nearly 20 million active mobile banking users across the United States. Executives at both banks stress they are focused on  evolving customer needs, but banks for decades have also been looking to cut costs by moving transactions to ATMs, online banking sites and now mobile devices. Banks are hoping new mobile services will eventually cost less than handling transactions in branches, even if there are high upfront costs, said Peter Olynick, card and payments leader at Carlisle & Gallagher Consulting Group. Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan has said that increasing mobile use can help the bank scale back on branches and therefore cut costs. “It is just a much more efficient and frankly strong service model,” he said during the bank’s second-quarter earnings conference call last week. The bank previously said it plans to eliminate 750 branches over the next few years and, in the past year, it has quietly shed about 9 percent of its ATMs. The bank now has about 5,600 branches and 16,200 ATMs. Bank of America spokeswoman Tara Burke said the bank’s ATM numbers declined as it removed machines at Simon Property Group Inc malls and in Valero Energy Corp convenience stores. Many of these locations did not allow for check deposits or have 24-hour access, she said. While the bank’s ATM numbers are shrinking, its total active mobile users increased by about 600,000 to 10.3 million in the second quarter of this year from the first quarter. Mobile payments can also help Bank of America defend its business from non-bank rivals such as eBay Inc’s PayPal Inc, which are increasingly encroaching on banks’ payments businesses, including person-to-person transactions, Carlisle & Gallagher’s Olynick said. “The banks that are not as aggressive are at risk to other entrants and other banks that are going aggressively after this,” Olynick said. Rivals JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup Inc, for example, already offer the check deposit service. “Mobile deposit capture has been really positively received,” said Beth Robertson, director of payments research at consulting firm Javelin Strategy & Research. “It makes things so much easier for consumers and small business.” Banks are keen to defend their position in the payments processing business, which can generate big revenue for them.  Banks make about $14 billion of annual fees from processing debit cards for merchants, Javelin estimates. Credit cards are even more lucrative, with interchange fees paid in 2011 by merchants to Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc banks coming in at $22.75 billion, according to industry publication The Nilson Report. In another service available for mobile customers, Bank of America is expanding a coupon program that allows customers to receive discounts from retailers by clicking on offers sent directly to their online banking accounts. The bank began testing BankAmeriDeals in January and is now making it available across the United States by early August, Bhasin said.

515,WFC,Poor quality of Wells Fargo service angers bank analyst,"July 24 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co ticked off the wrong customer. Veteran bank analyst Dick Bove, normally a strong defender of big banks, lashed out on Tuesday against the No. 4 U.S. bank for the poor service it provided one of its customers: Him. In an unusual research note, Bove, of Rochdale Research, listed a series of grievances at his branch in Tampa, Florida,  where he said he enjoyed strong service before Wells bought Wachovia in 2008. He still views Wells Fargo as one of the best managed banks in the United States, but concludes that serving customers well is much less important than selling them products. Effective financial management is also more important than customer service, he added. But Bove does care about customer service. He has been moving his accounts to JPMorgan Chase & Co, which is expanding in the Tampa market. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Mary Eshet said the bank does not comment on analyst reports, but noted the bank conducts more than 60,000 surveys of retail banking customers each month. During the Wachovia merger, nearly eight out of 10 customers indicated they were “extremely satisfied,” the highest rating, she said. “Customer service is incredibly important and central to our vision and values at Wells Fargo,” Eshet said. “We also recognize that we’re only as good as our last interaction and we remain committed to putting our customers at the center of everything we do.” Bove does not feel the bank was putting him first. In his report, he describes when a banker asked him to wait to talk with him, but instead went to the bathroom and then left the branch. In another example, the branch referred Bove to a call center for a question about a check, only to have the call center refer him back to the branch. In an interview, Bove said the last straw came about 10 days ago when he withdrew an application to refinance his mortgage that had dragged on for about four months. Wells later sent him a note saying his application had been denied, which could hurt his credit rating. Bove said he has been talking with the bank about his grievances for months, telling them his experience made him question the its statements about commitment to customer service. “What my Wells Fargo experience suggests is that a successful bank is one that keeps seeking new customers and selling them more products and not getting bogged down by offering service,” Bove wrote in his note.",7242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-service/poor-quality-of-wells-fargo-service-angers-bank-analyst-idUSL2E8IO8O120120724

518,WFC,Wells Fargo remains top US mortgage lender but share slips,"July 25 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co remained the largest U.S. mortgage originator in the second quarter, but ceded market share to its biggest rivals, Inside Mortgage Finance said on Wednesday. The fourth-largest U.S. bank made 32.4 percent of mortgages, down from a record 33.9 percent in the first quarter. The next three largest lenders — JPMorgan Chase & Co, U.S. Bancorp and Bank of America Corp — all gained share, according to the industry publication. A surge in mortgage banking income helped Wells and other banks boost profits in the second quarter as homeowners continued to refinance at low interest rates. Bank of America has fallen to fourth from second in the rankings since deciding last year to stop buying loans from smaller banks and mortgage companies, which is known as correspondent lending. But in the second quarter it showed the biggest increase in new loans, more than 18 percent, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. Wells Fargo still has nearly three times the market share of its closest competitor, JPMorgan, but some of its rivals stepped up their efforts in the second quarter, said Guy Cecala, Inside Mortgage Finance’s publisher. Bank of America, for example, has said it is adding more loan officers. “Wells Fargo has a huge lead over other lenders, but the notion that they would take it from 30 percent to 40 percent was a little over optimistic,” Cecala said.",7252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/banks-mortgages/wells-fargo-remains-top-us-mortgage-lender-but-share-slips-idUSL2E8IPFHI20120725
519,WFC,Wells Fargo names first chief information security officer,"July 30 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co on Monday named a Deloitte & Touche consultant to a new position overseeing the security of customer and company information. Rich Baich, who previously led the global cyber threat and vulnerability management practice at Deloitte, will become the fourth-largest U.S. bank’s chief information security officer this summer. He will report to Martin Davis, head of enterprise technology services. The bank created the position because of the increased size and scope of the bank’s operations after its 2008 Wachovia acquisition, spokeswoman Sara Hawkins said. Before Deloitte, Baich held security positions at Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP, ChoicePoint Inc and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He served in the U.S. Navy for 20 years as an information warfare officer, cryptology officer and surface warfare officer. Baich was chief information security officer at ChoicePoint  in 2005 when the U.S. data aggregation company suffered a well-publicized data breach involving access to personal information on 145,000 customers. In a 2005 Computerworld interview, Baich stressed the breach was the result of fraud rather than traditional computer hacking. ChoicePoint had said individuals posing as legitimate businesses accessed consumer data, including Social Security numbers and credit histories. Hawkins declined to comment on Baich’s role at ChoicePoint, which was acquired in 2008 by Reed Elsevier PLC.",7302012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-security/wells-fargo-names-first-chief-information-security-officer-idUSL2E8IUCNK20120730

521,WFC,Wells Fargo could lose more on mortgage repurchases: filing,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) said in a filing on Tuesday that it could lose $2.6 billion in addition to the reserves it has already set aside for investor requests to buy back soured mortgage loans, a 13 percent increase from three months ago. The fourth-largest U.S. bank had previously said that it increased its reserves in the second quarter for so-called repurchase requests because of rising demands from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for losses tied to loans made from 2006 to 2008. At the end of June, the bank had total reserves for repurchase requests of $1.8 billion, up from $1.4 billion at the end of March. The estimate of possible losses on top of those reserves is “reasonably possible” but does not represent a “probable loss,” the bank said in its quarterly filing. Wells Fargo is among a number of banks that said in second-quarter earnings conference calls that they were facing increased requests by Fannie and Freddie to buy back mortgages originally sold off during the housing boom. The two entities, which are in government conservatorship, have said they are trying to diminish losses for U.S. taxpayers. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) faces the biggest threat from repurchase requests because it bought subprime lending giant Countrywide Financial in 2008.

527,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Wells Fargo adds broker teams to independent unit,"Aug 10 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co added two veteran adviser teams to its independent brokerage division in July, expanding its broker force in Connecticut and Utah. The advisers, who managed about $225 million in client assets at their old firms, came from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney  and Citizens Bank. They joined Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, or “FiNet,” the company’s broker-dealer division catering to independent advisers who also function as business owners. “We’re used to the wirehouse model, and FiNet offered us the ability to keep that model and yet stay independent,” said Richard Schofield, who moved to Wells from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney with his son and fellow adviser Dustin Schofield. The biggest U.S. brokerages, such as Wells Fargo Advisors and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, are often considered “wirehouse” brokerages because of their ties to large Wall Street banks that offer access to proprietary investment products, research and technology. Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch and UBS’s Wealth Management Americas unit are in that category. The senior Schofield, a three-decade industry veteran, worked at Merrill Lynch earlier in his career. He and his son managed more than $128 million in client assets at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. After their office branch in the small town of St. George, Utah, was set to close because of consolidation of branches at the firm, the advisers decided to move. They formed the Schofield Group Investment Management team at Wells and now run their own practice. “Now that we are business owners, our clients respect us more and can relate to us better,” said the younger Schofield, noting that many of his clients are business owners themselves. Also on the move, advisers Jayme Lemaire and Jamie Nowakowski joined Wells in Connecticut from CCO Investment Services Corp, the broker-dealer affiliated with Citizens Bank. The advisers managed more than $96 million in client assets at CCO and generated $1.1 million in annual production. They formed the JayPex Financial Group in Uncasville, Connecticut. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, which also has a traditional employee broker-dealer and banking division, has the third-largest U.S. brokerage by client assets, after Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Merrill Lynch. The brokerage business, based in St. Louis, has more than 15,000 advisers with $1.2 trillion in client assets among its brokerage subsidiaries. Roughly $56 billion of those assets came from its independent unit, which now has more than 1,100 owners and advisers in nearly 550 practices. So far this year, Wells has added at least 86 veteran advisers who managed more than $9.7 billion in client assets at their old firms, based on moves tracked by Reuters. Many of the new hires joined the company through FiNet.",8102012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-advisers/on-the-move-wells-fargo-adds-broker-teams-to-independent-unit-idUSL2E8J96VK20120810

Edwards & Sons advisers, and moved to Wells Fargo only after their firm was acquired in 2007 by Wachovia, which one year later became a part of Wells. “The big institution ... was not where they felt comfortable,” said RBC branch manager David Thompson, who runs the Newport Beach branch where Bockhold and Voorhees are based. “They were looking for more of a boutique feel.” Thompson said RBC Wealth, with roughly 2,000 U.S.-based advisers and $227 billion in client assets, reminded the advisers of their original small-firm roots. Wells Fargo Advisors comparatively has more than 15,000 advisers managing $1.2 trillion in client assets. Bockhold, a nearly two-decade industry veteran, joined RBC Wealth as a senior vice president, while Voorhees joined the firm as a first vice president. The advisers were joined by client associates Maureen Ortiz and Kathleen Carroll. RBC Wealth’s Newport Beach office has 14 advisers including the recent hires. Thompson said he hopes to add at least five advisers within the next 12 months. Since the start of the year, RBC Wealth as a whole has added at least 20 experienced advisers from major brokerages, including Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, Wells Fargo Advisors and Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch. Those new recruits managed more than more than $1.9 billion in client assets at their previous firms, based on moves tracked by Reuters.",8132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/rbc-wealth/on-the-move-rbc-wealth-adds-veteran-broker-team-from-wells-fargo-idUSL2E8JD66O20120813
531,WFC,Wells Fargo to pay more than $6.5 million to settle SEC charges,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co will pay more than $6.5 million to settle civil charges alleging it sold complex mortgage-backed instruments to municipalities and non-profits during the financial crisis without fully disclosing the risks. The case marks the latest effort by the Securities and Exchange Commission to hold banks accountable for their actions during the crisis. The SEC said that Wells Fargo’s brokerage unit based in Minneapolis agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the charges. It will pay a $6.5 million penalty, plus $65,000 in disgorgement and more than $16,000 in prejudgment interest. The money will go into a fair fund to help harmed investors. In addition to charging the company, the SEC also charged a former Wells Fargo vice president, Shawn Patrick McMurtry, 42, for his role in selling the products. He settled the charges without admitting or denying them. He will pay a $25,000 penalty and will also be suspended from the industry for six months. “These issues occurred more than five years ago and pertain to a part of the firm that was completely revamped after the merger with Wachovia. We are pleased to put this matter behind us,” said Wells Fargo spokeswoman Elise Wilkinson. The SEC alleged in its administrative filing that from January to August 2007, Wells Fargo sold customers asset-backed commercial paper that was structured with risky mortgage-related securities including collateralized debt obligations. The investors later suffered “substantial losses” after the mortgage-backed complex products defaulted. In selling these risky products to municipalities and non-profits, the SEC said Wells Fargo “relied almost exclusively on the credit-ratings of these products” and did not properly review the private placement documentation to better understand the risks. Credit-rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s have since been blamed by critics for helping to fuel the 2007-2009 financial crisis by giving overly rosy ratings to complex products tied to subprime mortgages that later soured. The agency said that “multiple registered representatives” at Wells Fargo, including McMurtry, exercised discretionary authority to purchase asset-backed commercial paper on customers’ behalf. The SEC said that McMurtry purchased products tied to mortgage-backed securities for one customer even though the customer had sought to avoid exposure to the housing market and state law also prohibited municipalities from having exposure to high-risk mortgage-backed instruments. The SEC’s case was brought by the agency’s enforcement unit that specializes in municipal securities and public pensions. “Broker-dealers must do their homework before recommending complex investments to their customers,” said the unit’s chief Elaine Greenberg. “Municipalities and other non-profit institutions were harmed because Wells Fargo abdicated its fundamental responsibility as a broker to have a reasonable basis for its investment recommendations to customers,” she added.

536,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Wells Fargo raids Morgan Stanley for advisers,"Aug 17 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co has raided the adviser ranks of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, hiring seven veterans in five U.S. states who manage nearly $900 million in assets. Wells announced four other adviser hires in two more states, with all to join Wells Fargo Advisors, the company’s St. Louis-based brokerage business. The 11 advisers managed a total of $1.4 billion in client assets at their old firms. Allen Wilson joined Wells in Florham Park, New Jersey last week from Stifel Nicolaus & Co, where he managed $212 million in client assets. “I wanted to align myself with a bigger, top-tier company,” he said in an interview. He was joined by his client associate Susan McNamara, also from Stifel. Wilson, whose business is primarily based in fixed income, said he chose to move because he wanted to expand the types of products and services he could offer his clients in that market. Wilson joined Wells’ private client group, the biggest division within the company’s brokerage business, which has more than 15,000 advisers with $1.2 trillion in client assets among its brokerage subsidiaries. Wells also has a broker-dealer unit for independent advisers and a separate division of advisers who work in bank branches. Also on the move, Louisiana-based adviser Michael Prat joined Wells from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, where he managed $251 million in client assets. He joined Wells’ New Orleans office and reports to branch manager Billy Blakeman. Prat had been with his old firm for more than 30 years. He was a legacy Citigroup Smith Barney adviser who joined Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in 2009 after Smith Barney merged with Morgan Stanley’s wealth unit that year. In Florida, adviser Jeff Drowos and his son Bryan Drowos joined Wells from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, where they managed $198 million in client assets. The two advisers are based in Boca Raton and were joined by their client associate Cindy Shore. They report to market manager Alex Bigelow. The senior Drowos had been at his old firm for more than two decades and also worked at Merrill Lynch. Both Drowos and his son were legacy Smith Barney advisers. In Alabama, advisers James “Jimmy” Burns and Judson “Judd” Fleming joined Wells from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, where they managed $146 million in client assets and were legacy Smith Barney. Burns also had worked at Merrill Lynch for two decades. They joined Wells’ Birmingham office and report to market manager Jay Hoyle. In New York, adviser Cynthia Colin joined Wells from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, where she managed $154 million in client assets. Colin, a four-decade industry veteran and legacy Smith Barney, had been at her old firm for more than 30 years. She is based out of Wells’ Park Avenue branch and reports to branch manager Tim Sheridan. In Illinois, adviser Steve Freidin joined Wells from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, where he managed $110 million in client assets. Freidin was joined by financial consultant Larry Malles and they both report to complex manager Jim Johnson in Wells’ Lake Forest office. All seven of the advisers from Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joined the Wells’ private client group. From UBS Wealth Management Americas , adviser Jack Lobianco joined Wells’ St. Petersburg, Florida office, where he reports to branch manager Gary Garcia. Lobianco, a 22-year industry veteran, managed $109 million in client assets at UBS. From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, adviser Lance Hubeny joined Wells in New Jersey. Hubeny, a nearly three-decade industry veteran, managed $98 million in client assets at Merrill. He reports to complex manager John Puzio and is based out of Wells’ Red Bank office. Both Lobianco and Hubeny joined Wells’ private client group. From Phillips & Co, adviser Pil Hwang joined Wells’ banking division in Portland, Oregon, where he reports to regional brokerage manager Tony Brauner. Hwang, a 14-year industry veteran, managed $120 million in client assets. So far this year, Wells has added at least 97 veteran advisers who managed more than $11 billion in client assets at their old firms, based on moves tracked by Reuters. Reuters tracks the moves of individual advisers or teams that manage about $100 million or more in client assets, which typically translates to $1 million or more in annual production.",8172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo/on-the-move-wells-fargo-raids-morgan-stanley-for-advisers-idUSL2E8JF2UI20120817

539,WFC,"Ameriprise adds veteran advisers from Wells, LPL","(Reuters) - Ameriprise Financial Inc has added two veteran adviser teams from Wells Fargo & Co and LPL Financial that together managed more than $225 million in client assets. The teams, both New Jersey-based, joined Ameriprise’s franchise group, which caters to independent advisers who also function as business owners. The unit accounts for roughly 78 percent of the company’s adviser base, which also includes a traditional employee division. “Their growth model through acquisition is tremendous,” said adviser John Lupi, a 26-year industry veteran, who moved to Ameriprise last week with his team from Wells Fargo. “We want to grow the size and scope of the branch.” Lupi moved with colleagues Richard Karpinski and Jose Hernandez and said he hopes to eventually expand his branch to 10 to 15 advisers. The team, which managed about $110 million in client assets, is based in Colts Neck, New Jersey. After spending the bulk of his adviser career at the brokerages of big Wall Street companies, Lupi said, moving to Ameriprise brought a change of pace from the big bank mentality he experienced at other firms. “Their focus is on the client specifically, and that’s directly in line with our philosophy,” he said. Also on the move, adviser James Marchesi and his team joined Ameriprise in Chester, New Jersey, from LPL Financial, where they managed more than $115 million in client assets. Marchesi had previously been an adviser at Citigroup and before that, Merrill Lynch. Ameriprise, based in Minneapolis, has more than 9,600 advisers across the United States. Many of the company’s big broker recruits so far this year have come from top U.S. brokerages, including Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo Advisors.

542,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Benjamin Edwards lands 4 advisers from Wells Fargo,"Aug 31 (Reuters) - Benjamin F. Edwards & Co, a boutique brokerage with family ties to the old A.G. Edwards & Sons, opened a new office in Kansas after landing four veteran advisers from Wells Fargo & Co on Friday. The new hires joined Benjamin Edwards from Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage unit of the San Francisco-based bank. Their new office is based in Leawood, a suburb of Kansas City. “It’s a strong group of financial advisers who fit very well into our model,” said Benjamin Edwards’ director of branch services, Marty Altenberger, in an interview on Friday. Altenberger said the St. Louis-based firm, which now has 25 branches in 15 states, has attracted many veteran advisers because of its small size relative to other larger brokerages. “I think our size is our advantage,” he said. “We’re nimble.” Among the new additions, advisers Lawrence Grant Ingram and Gary Liberty moved to Benjamin Edwards as a team, along with their registered financial associate Monet Matthews. The two advisers were both legacy A.G. Edwards advisers with roots dating back more than a decade. A.G. Edwards & Sons was acquired in 2007 by Wachovia, which one year later was acquired by Wells Fargo. Many legacy A.G. Edwards advisers stayed with the brokerage through the acquisitions. Also on the move, advisers Brian Wiklund and John Diederich joined Benjamin Edwards’ Leawood office as individual advisers from Wells Fargo. They were both also legacy A.G. Edwards advisers who had been with their old firm for roughly a decade each. Wiklund was joined by registered financial associate Julie Keithline. With the opening of the new office in Kansas, Benjamin Edwards also hired assistant branch manager Lori Cox, who was previously a Kansas City market operations manager for Wells Fargo Advisors. In a separate move, Benjamin Edwards also added adviser Tom Morrison in Illinois on Tuesday from Morrison Financial Services, Ltd, his old independent practice he founded in 1983. He closed his practice to join Benjamin Edwards’ Wheaton office. Since its founding in 2008, Benjamin Edwards has expanded its adviser base by hiring dozens of legacy A.G. Edwards advisers from Wells Fargo. Since the start of the year, the firm has added at least 21 veteran advisers from Wells Fargo, based on moves tracked by Reuters.

544,WFC,"Wells Fargo should buy lender CIT Group, analyst says","(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, (WFC.N) the fourth-largest U.S. bank, could boost its profits by buying CIT Group Inc (CIT.N) even if it pays a 33 percent premium for the specialty lender, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher Mutascio said on Monday. “CIT would make a financially attractive acquisition target” for Wells Fargo, Mutascio said in a report. A deal would combine Wells Fargo’s “industry-low” cost of funds with CIT’s $35 billion in higher-yielding assets. Wells Fargo would benefit, too, from acquiring CIT’s tax-sheltering $4 billion of net operating loss carry forwards, he said. Mutascio figured that Wells Fargo could pay $52 per share for CIT, or $10.5 billion, and raise its own earnings per share by 2 percent to 7 percent, depending on whether it paid with stock, cash or a blend of the two. CIT shares traded at $38.95 on Friday. The stock is up nearly 12 percent this year. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Mary Eshet and CIT spokesman Curt Ritter declined to comment. Wells Fargo has $1.34 trillion in assets and a stock market value of $186 billion. CIT is led by veteran Wall Street executive John Thain. He was named CEO in February 2010 to continue the company’s restructuring following its bankruptcy in 2009 amid losses on subprime mortgage assets. Thain has paid down high-cost debt left from the bankruptcy, but CIT still pays 4.37 percent for core debt funding and 2.02 percent for deposits, compared with Wells Fargo’s total funding cost of 0.46 percent, according to Mutascio.

545,WFC,Wells Fargo website hit by access issues amid cyber threats,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co on Tuesday became the latest bank to suffer problems with its website amid heightened concerns about cyber attacks against U.S. financial institutions. The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets confirmed that some of its customers experienced intermittent access issues on Tuesday. The bank was working to quickly resolve the issues, a spokeswoman said, declining to comment on the source of the problem. A financial services industry group last week warned U.S. banks, brokerages and insurers to be on heightened alert for cyber attacks after Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co experienced unexplained outages on their public websites. Wells Fargo’s problems came the same day that an unidentified person on the Internet called on “cyberspace workers” to attack the bank’s site. In a posting on pastebin.com, the person also warned of attacks later this week against U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. A similar posting last week made threats against Bank of America and the New York Stock Exchange. The poster said the attacks will continue until the film that had stirred up anti-U.S. protests across the Middle East was removed from the Internet. A U.S. Bancorp spokesman said the bank was aware of the posting and was working closely with law enforcement authorities. A PNC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Senator Joseph Lieberman, chairman of the Senate’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said on Friday that he believes Iran was behind the attacks. Reuters reported on Friday that Iranian hackers have repeatedly attacked Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup Inc over the past year as part of a broad cyber campaign targeting the United States, according to people familiar with the situation. The attacks, which began in late 2011 and escalated this year, have primarily been “denial of service” campaigns that disrupted the banks’ websites and corporate networks by overwhelming them with incoming web traffic, said the sources.

546,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Morgan Stanley duo goes independent with Wells Fargo,"Oct 2 (Reuters) - After 15 years in the brokerage industry and two company mergers later, Maryland-based advisers Brian Luts and David Greenleigh decided it was time to take their book of business independent. The two advisers, who started at the same Prudential Securities office in Washington, D.C. in 1997, moved to Wells Fargo & Co’s independent broker-dealer on Tuesday. They were most recently advisers with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, where they managed $250 million in client assets and generated $1.5 million in annual revenue last year. Luts and Greenleigh moved to Citigroup’s Smith Barney in 2004 after their old firm, Prudential Securities, was bought by Wachovia. Only five years later, Smith Barney was rolled into Morgan Stanley’s wealth management business. “We started seeing the writing on the wall very similarly with when Wachovia bought Prudential,” Luts said, referring to technology and cultural changes at his old firm following the merger. Those changes were enough to prompt the adviser team to look for an alternative home for their clients’ assets. They chose Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, or “FiNet,” the company’s broker-dealer division catering to independent advisers who also function as business owners. “There’s this whole world of other tasks that we as retail brokers never experienced or knew we had to do - things we always left up to the bigger firm,” said Luts, noting that was part of their decision to join FiNet. While not all client assets are guaranteed to move with a broker, the majority of a veteran adviser’s book will. Brokers with two or more decades of experience who decamp for a rival often bring up to 85 percent of client assets they manage with them — up to 95 percent when they go independent, according to recruiters. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, which also has a traditional employee broker-dealer and banking division, has the third-largest U.S. brokerage by client assets, after Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The brokerage business, based in St. Louis, has more than 15,000 advisers with $1.2 trillion in client assets among its brokerage subsidiaries. Roughly $55.5 billion of those assets came from its independent unit, which now has more than 1,100 owners and advisers in more than 540 practices.",10022012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo/on-the-move-morgan-stanley-duo-goes-independent-with-wells-fargo-idUSL1E8KSGQD20121002

548,WFC,UPDATE 1-MOVES-Wells Fargo shifts management in wealth group,"* Hays to move to unit selling products to bank clients * Hays was president of Wells’s private client group * Wells seeks replacement to head private client group By Jed Horowitz NEW YORK, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co has transferred Jim Hays, a veteran wealth management executive who had run its large brokerage network, to oversee a smaller group of brokers at the bank’s branches. It is the latest in a series of executive changes this year at Wells Fargo Advisors, the third-largest brokerage network in the United States, with more than 15,000 financial advisers. As executive vice president and head of wealth brokerage services, Hays will oversee 3,800 advisers and support staff who sell stocks, bonds and other investment products to “mass affluent” bank clients with more than $100,000 of investable assets. He will also manage Wells’ group of in-branch private bankers who solicit business from wealthier clients and the investment services the bank provides to community banks. Wells Fargo Advisors is conducting a search to replace Hays as president of its private client group, the largest of its brokerage business with more than 11,000 advisers in standalone brokerage offices. Hays had run the unit since 2005. The change comes as Wells steps up attempts to cross-sell investment products to its core banking clients and to market loans and other bank products to its wealthy brokerage clients.  Banks have for decades strived to dig deeper into customers’ wallets, with limited marketing success. Hays replaces Mary Mack, who moved from the brokerage services group in July to become president of Wells Fargo Advisors’ financial services group. It creates and contracts for products to sell throughout Wells’s bank and brokerage networks. Kent Christian, a Wells Advisors veteran who had run the products group, moved earlier this year to lead its Financial Network, or FiNet, a group of independent brokers who affiliate with the larger brokerage for support and regulatory services. As part of the daisy chain of management changes, former FiNet head John Peluso now runs First Clearing, which provides record-keeping and loan services to Wells Fargo Advisors and smaller broker-dealers. California-based Wells moved strongly into U.S. brokerage services when it bought Wachovia Corp. for about $12.7 billion during the heart of the financial crisis in January 2009. Wachovia’s securities subsidiary was one of the four largest broker-dealers at the time. In 2011, Wells sold Wachovia’s H.D. Vest brokerage unit, which specialized in selling financial products through accounting firms, for $153 million.

549,WFC,U.S. sues Wells Fargo in mortgage fraud case,"(Reuters) - The U.S. government filed a civil mortgage fraud lawsuit on Tuesday against Wells Fargo & Co, the latest legal volley against big banks for their lending during the housing boom. The complaint, brought by the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, seeks damages and civil penalties from Wells Fargo for more than 10 years of alleged misconduct related to government-insured Federal Housing Administration loans. The lawsuit alleges the FHA paid hundreds of millions of dollars on insurance claims on thousands of defaulted mortgages as a result of false certifications by Wells Fargo, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank as measured by assets. “As the complaint alleges, yet another major bank has engaged in a longstanding and reckless trifecta of deficient training, deficient underwriting and deficient disclosure, all while relying on the convenient backstop of government insurance,” said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. Wells, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, denied the allegations and said in a statement it believes it acted in good faith and in compliance with FHA and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development rules. The bank said many of the allegations have been previously addressed with HUD and added that its FHA delinquency rates have been as low as half the industry average. In a regulatory filing in August, the bank said it was being investigated for possible violations of laws and regulations relating to mortgage origination practices, including FHA loans. Wells said it will vigorously defend itself against the suit. Bharara’s office has brought similar cases in the past few years, including one against Citigroup Inc unit CitiMortgage Inc, which settled the case for $158.3 million in February, and against Deutsche Bank, which paid $202.3 million in May to resolve its case. The U.S. Attorney’s office in Brooklyn brought the biggest such case, against Bank of America Corp’s Countrywide unit, which agreed in February to pay $1 billion to resolve the allegations. The Wells Fargo case is brought under the False Claims Act, which provides penalties for fraud against the government, and under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act, or FIRREA for short, a little-used statute that has grown in popularity in the past year. The law requires a lower burden of proof than criminal charges, has a longer statute of limitations than other financial laws and potentially could bring big fines. A civil fraud unit that Bharara created in March 2010 filed its first lawsuit under FIRREA in December of that year. At issue In Tuesday’s suit are loans Wells Fargo made through a program that allows banks to originate, underwrite and certify mortgages for FHA insurance, according to the complaint. Under the so-called Direct Endorsement Lender program, neither the FHA nor HUD reviews a loan before it is approved for FHA insurance, but lenders are supposed to follow program rules. Between May 2001 and October 2005, according to the complaint, Wells certified more than 100,000 loans for FHA insurance, even though the bank knew its underwriters had failed to verify information that was directly related to the borrower’s ability to make payments. “The extreme poor quality of Wells Fargo’s loans was a function of management’s singular focus on increasing the volume of FHA originations (and the bank’s profits), rather than the quality of the loans being originated,” the complaint said. The bank also failed to properly train its staff, hired temporary workers and paid improper bonuses to its underwriters to encourage them to approve as many loans as possible, the complaint said. During a 7-month stretch in 2002, at least 42 percent of the bank’s FHA loans failed to actual qualify for the insurance they were submitted for, even though the bank’s internal benchmark for such violations was set at 5 percent. Wells also kept its defective loans secret from HUD, the complaint said. From January 2002 to December 2010, the bank internally identified more than 6,000 “materially deficient” loans, including 3,000 that had defaulted in the first six months, but did not comply with its self-reporting obligations, the complaint said. Prior to October 2005, the bank did not self-report a single bad loan, and the inadequate reporting continued even after a HUD inquiry that year, the suit states. All told, from 2002 through 2010 the bank self-reported only 238 loans, according to the complaint. Some of the mortgages Wells Fargo suspected of fraud but declined to report to HUD include loans it separately reported as suspicious activity to the U.S. Treasury Department, according to the suit. The complaint seeks treble damages and penalties for hundreds of millions of dollars in insurance claims already paid to Wells Fargo, as well as penalties on claims HUD may pay in the future. Citi, in its settlement, paid $158 million to resolve allegations that a “substantial percentage” of around $200 million in insurance claims failed to meet FHA requirements. The Wells Fargo complaint also includes specific allegations that the lender failed to report another $190 million in loans it should have flagged as potentially problematic to HUD, which potentially adds to any eventual payout from the bank. The lawsuit adds to the growing number of civil cases the government has filed targeting conduct that allegedly contributed to the financial crisis. The Justice Department has indicted few individuals and institutions on criminal charges for roles in the collapse, and officials have said prosecutors determined much of the conduct amounted to greed but not crimes. A joint federal-state task force set up earlier this year to continue to probe conduct tied to the 2007-2009 crisis has also acknowledged the bulk of its inquiries are under civil law.

553,WFC,Bank stocks expected to swing less than usual on earnings,"* JPMorgan, Wells Fargo to kick off bank earnings on Friday * Options market prices in relatively low risk for banks * Large put buying in Financial XLF ETF seen recently By Angela Moon and Doris Frankel Oct 11 (Reuters) - This earnings season looks like it will turn out well for U.S. banks, but given the run the financials have had in 2012, some options traders appear to be taking a cautious stance. The two largest names in the banking sector by market value, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo, will report earnings Friday morning. Both stocks are up sharply this year, helping lead financials to a gain of 24 percent in 2012. The Financial Select Sector SPDR fund, which tracks the financial stocks in the S&P; 500, is up about 7 percent for the third quarter and its 24 percent gain in 2012 has outpaced the S&P; 500 index, which is up 14 percent for the year. But overall activity in XLF put options - contracts that give the right to sell the underlying security at a fixed price by a certain date - has picked up as earnings estimates have declined. Overall earnings estimates for the financials have fallen by 3.3 percent over the last 30 days, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The sector is expected to report year-over-year growth of about 1 percent for the quarter, which is down from an estimate of 5 percent growth just two weeks ago. “We’ve turned bearish (on financials), probably more than we have ever been, and started to accumulate shorts and put positions in the last few days,” said James Dailey, portfolio manager at TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In the options market, heavy protective trading was seen in the XLF, including a large January 2013 $13-$15 put spread   purchased on the fund earlier this week on the view that its  shares could fall nearly 20 percent in the next three months. However, the options market is also pricing in relatively low risk expectations for several banks reporting before Oct. 19 options expiration. Some strategists believe the market should be pricing in higher expectations for volatility, as large-cap financials have several potential catalysts that could sway the shares up or down. “Overall results could reflect the fallout from the ongoing financial crisis in the eurozone as well as the November U.S. presidential election, which could be crucial regarding regulatory measures impacting the financial sector,” said Ryan Renicker, head of global market strategy at Newedge USA Inc in New York. The implied volatility for JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co for the next 30 days is extremely low heading into their earnings, said Ophir Gottlieb, managing director of options analytics firm Livevol in San Francisco. Typically, implied volatility - a key component for an options price measuring the perceived risk of future stock movement - rises into earnings. In these cases, the low implied volatility compared with the past 12 months is “surprising and unusual,” Gottlieb said. At-the-money implied volatility for the next 30 days was at about 24 percent for Wells Fargo and at 27 percent for JPMorgan, below recent highs of 49 percent and 55 percent, respectively, reached in November 2011, Livevol data showed. Wells Fargo options are implying a one-day earnings move   of 3.25 percent up or down for its shares, slightly below the average move of 4 percent over the past eight quarters. The heaviest open interest is concentrated in the October $35 WFC strike calls, with 60,000 contracts outstanding, said Enis Taner, global macro editor at options trading firm RiskReversal.com in New York. In JPMorgan, options are implying an earnings-day move of 2.5 to 3.1 percent in either direction, compared with an average move of nearly 3 percent over the past eight quarters, analysts and traders said. “JPMorgan also has a tendency to rally into earnings, and sell off afterward over the past few years,” Taner said. JPMorgan shares are up 27 percent for the year and Wells Fargo has gained 29 percent for the year. Risk expectations for Bank of America Inc, which reports Oct. 17, are also abnormally low. “Bank of America shares are likely to come under pressure and its downside risk appears to be more substantial than the upside,” Renicker said. Its shares have risen 17.5 percent since Sept. 6, whereas Wells Fargo shares have rallied only 4 percent in that time. Bank of America options imply a 4.2 percent move post-earnings, slightly higher than the average move of 3.7 percent over the past eight quarters, Renicker said.",10112012,http://www.reuters.com/article/banks-earnings-options/bank-stocks-expected-to-swing-less-than-usual-on-earnings-idUSL1E8LBGP320121011
554,WFC,"Cyber attacks against Wells Fargo ""significant,"" handled well: CFO","(Reuters) - Recent cyber attacks against Wells Fargo & Co were “pretty significant” but didn’t cause customer losses or a major increase in expenses, the bank’s Chief Financial Officer, Tim Sloan, told Reuters on Friday.

557,WFC,TEXT-S&P; says Wells Fargo & Co ratings unaffected by Q3 results,"Oct 12 - Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services today said its ratings on Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC; A+/Negative/A-1) are unaffected by the company’s strong third-quarter results.  WFC generated $7.5 billion in pretax income, up 22.3% from the same quarter in  2011, which represents a strong 35.4% pretax margin, compared with 31.3% last  year. Third-quarter results benefited from continued strong mortgage  performance, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter, and a $767  million reserve release, up from $400 million in the second quarter. The  material increase in reserve releases was largely due to the write-off of  already reserved for loans resulting from the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency (OCC)’s new accounting guidance on Chapter 7 bankruptcy borrowers.  Without this change, reserve releases would have declined to $200 million in  the third quarter. We expect modest reserve releases to continue in the coming  quarters.   WFC’s expense reduction is on track, in our view. The efficiency ratio  improved to 57.1% from 59.5% in third-quarter 2011, and the company is within  its efficiency target of 55%-59%. The completion of the Wachovia Corp.  integration benefited improvements in efficiency.    The net interest margin (NIM) slipped a greater-than-expected 25 basis points  (bps) to 3.66% from the second quarter. This decrease resulted largely from  lower variable income, as well as higher levels of cash and short-term  investments—due to strong deposit growth—and lower interest rates and the  run-off of higher-yield investments and loans. We expect continued downward  pressure on the NIM over the next few quarters.  Credit quality continues to improve but is not yet back to pre-crisis levels.  Excluding write-offs due to the new accounting rules, the net charge-off ratio  would have fallen to 0.92% from 1.15% last quarter. With the new write-offs,  the rate is 1.21%. Reported total nonperforming assets were 3.2%, unchanged  from last quarter and only marginally affected by the new accounting guidance.  Although the Purchase Credit Impaired (PCI) portfolio could still pose  incremental credit risk in the event of a recession, it continues to perform  better than we initially expected, and recent improvements in home prices help  mitigate the risk.  Core loans were up 1.8% in the third quarter compared with the previous  quarter, primarily because the company retained $9.8 billion in mortgages  rather than securitizing these assets and buying them back as lower-yield  mortgage-backed securities. This activity highlights the challenge of dealing  with margin pressure in attempting to find suitable investments with higher  yields as deposits continue to grow. Average core deposits increased 7%  (annualized) for the year and 7% (annualized) for the quarter. We expect WFC  to continue to look for asset acquisitions to boost loan growth.  Estimated Basel I Tier 1 common equity eased 2 bps to 10.06% during the third  quarter and is up 72 bps from a year ago. The company reported an estimated  Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 8.02%, up 24 bps from the previous quarter.  Over time, we believe WFC will continue to increase capital in anticipation of  Basel III while prudently returning capital to shareholders. In addition to  the regular dividend, the company repurchased 25.5 million shares (including a  forward purchase agreement to settle in the fourth quarter), and it did not  redeem any higher-coupon trust preferred securities.   The negative rating outlook on WFC reflects the outlook on the U.S. sovereign  rating given the extraordinary government support we incorporate into our  issuer credit rating on WFC. If we were to lower the U.S. sovereign rating by  one notch to ‘AA’, we would also lower the issuer credit rating on WFC because  we would remove the one notch of support we currently factor into the rating.  Similarly, we could revise our outlook on WFC to stable if we were to revise  our outlook on the U.S. sovereign rating to stable. Otherwise, we view WFC’s  fundamental credit trends as stable.",10122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA745020121012
558,WFC,"ON THE MOVE-Wells Fargo lands broker teams from UBS, Merrill","Oct 12 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s independent brokerage business has expanded in Florida and Oregon with veteran adviser teams that joined the company from rival firms UBS Wealth Management Americas and Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch. The teams, which each managed more than $200 million in client assets, are among the latest to join Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, or “FiNet,” the company’s brokerage division catering to independent advisers who also function as business owners. “Our family business is a key thing,” said Florida-based adviser Robert McKinnon, a former UBS branch manager who moved to Wells to open his own practice with his son, Kevin McKinnon,  and son-in-law, Matthew Wright. The three were previously advisers with UBS Wealth Management Americas, the U.S. brokerage business owned by the Swiss bank UBS AG , where they managed $211 million in client assets. McKinnon said many of the team’s clients are also small business owners themselves. “This move will help us understand their situation even better,” said McKinnon, who had been with UBS and its predecessor firms for more than three decades before moving last week. The team remained in Fort Lauderdale, where they had previously been based with UBS. Also on the move, in Oregon, advisers Michael Coursey, Rob Norton, Ryan Skogstad and Benny Won joined Wells’ FiNet in late September from Merrill Lynch, the brokerage owned by Bank of America Corp. They managed $250 million in client assets at Merrill. The team together formed Capstone Wealth Advisors LLC at Wells and are based in Salem. Wells said it also recently added two other adviser teams from Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Wealth Management in late September, as previously reported by Reuters. Those teams, based in California and Maryland, respectively, managed $349 million in client assets at their old firms. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo & Co, which also has a traditional employee broker-dealer and banking division, has the third-largest U.S. brokerage by client assets, after Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Merrill Lynch. UBS’s brokerage business ranks fourth. The four firms often compete for similar teams of veteran advisers. Wells’ brokerage business, based in St. Louis, has more than 15,000 advisers with about $1.2 trillion in client assets among its brokerage subsidiaries. Roughly $55.5 billion of those assets came from its independent unit, which now has more than 1,100 owners and advisers in more than 540 practices.",10122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo/on-the-move-wells-fargo-lands-broker-teams-from-ubs-merrill-idUSL1E8LC4Z420121012
559,WFC,"UPDATE 5-Wells Fargo profit a record, revenue disappoints","* Bank posts quarterly profit of $4.9 billion * Tops analysts’ estimates on EPS, misses on revenue * Net interest margin falls on low rates By Rick Rothacker and Jed Horowitz Oct 12 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s third-quarter profit jumped 22 percent as the largest U.S. mortgage lender benefited from a surge in home loan refinancings. The No. 4 U.S. bank by assets has expanded in mortgage lending while others such as Bank of America Corp have pulled back. It said it expects the lending boom to continue as the housing market shows signs of recovery and borrowers take advantage of low interest rates pushed by the Federal Reserve. “It feels like it is going to last at least a few quarters and obviously we hope it does,” Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan told analysts in a conference call. Wells reported third-quarter earnings per share of 88 cents, topping analysts’ consensus estimate of 87 cents, as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But the bank missed revenue estimates and a key banking measure dropped more than expected, sending its shares down in New York Stock Exchange trading. Net interest margin - the spread between what the bank pays on deposits and earns on loans - fell to 3.66 percent from 3.91 percent in the second quarter, a bigger drop than it warned of last month. Banks are experiencing shrinking margins as older loans with higher interest rates are paid down and they find fewer places to invest growing deposits. “The margin came in much worse than we expected, but mortgage banking was better,” Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Frederick Cannon wrote in a note to clients. “Overall, this was a slight beat this quarter, but the margin matters more.” Wells Fargo executives urged investors to focus on the bank’s overall profit rather than the shrinking margin. Chief Executive John Stumpf said the bank is also rapidly boosting fee income by selling products and services that do not depend on interest rates for loans. “Overall revenue is up 8 percent this year,” Stumpf said, while deposit growth is strong and bad loans and other expenses are declining. “Those are pretty good numbers.” Sloan said the bank’s net interest margin could remain under pressure through next year. The bank reported record net income of $4.9 billion on total revenue of $21.2 billion on the same day that JPMorgan Chase & Co also reported results to kick off the bank earnings season. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, said profits rose 34 percent to a record $5.71 billion. Wells shares were off 3.2 percent at $34.05 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The KBW Bank Index  of large banks, which includes Wells Fargo, was off 2.8 percent. Wells Fargo has emerged from the financial crisis as the dominant U.S. mortgage lender, making about one in three U.S. home loans and tripling the volume of its closest competitor, JPMorgan. In the quarter, Wells wrote $139 billion in mortgages versus $89 billion a year ago, but up only slightly from $131 billion in the second quarter. The bank’s decision to stop making loans through brokers cost it about $8 billion in volume, Sloan said in an interview. The bank typically sells most of the loans it makes to investors such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . But this quarter, executives decided to hold onto $9.8 billion in loans that were eligible to be sold to the mortgage finance companies. The move cost the bank about $200 million in fee income during the quarter, but in the long run executives said the loans would yield more than the mortgage-backed securities they  could have bought. The bank expects to add more mortgages to its portfolio in the fourth quarter. Sloan said the loans will not materially affect interest rate or credit risk at the bank, given the size of its overall loan portfolio. The bank can also sell the loans in the future if it wants, he added. While mortgages have boosted the bank’s bottom line, they have also produced some headaches. The U.S. Attorney in Manhattan this week filed a lawsuit accusing the bank of recklessly underwriting government-insured home loans. The bank has denied the allegations. [ID: nL1E8L9HPF] The bank also continued to set aside more money to cover investor demands to buy back soured mortgage loans it sold  during the housing boom. It added $462 million to those reserves in the third quarter, down from $669 million in the second quarter but up from $390 million a year ago. Total loans increased by $7.4 billion, or about 1 percent, from June 30, to $782.6 billion. The additional $9.8 billion in mortgages that the bank held instead of selling drove most of the increase. Wells Fargo also had increases in auto, credit card, student and commercial loans. The executives touted improvements in credit quality. The bank set aside less money for future loan losses than it charged off in the third quarter - a sign it believes credit quality is improving. Some of the third-quarter loan losses resulted from new regulations that will not have an effect in future quarters. Wells bought back 17 million shares of its own stock in the quarter, plus an additional 9 million under a contract that settles in the fourth quarter. Stumpf said the bank is looking forward to the next round of annual stress tests in which the bank can ask the Federal Reserve for permission to increase share buy-backs and dividends. Banks submit their capital plans in the first quarter. “We are really focused on getting more capital back to our stockholders,” he said.",10122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-earnings/update-5-wells-fargo-profit-a-record-revenue-disappoints-idUSL1E8LC36L20121012
560,WFC,TEXT-Fitch comments on Wells Fargo & Co,"Oct 12 - Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) once again reported a  record quarter with net income of $4.9 billion for the third quarter 2012  (3Q’12) for a strong ROA of 1.45%, according to Fitch Ratings. Results were  favorably impacted by an increase in noninterest income while a low rate  environment continued to weigh on interest income generated within the loan and  investment portfolios contributing to a material reduction in the company’s net  interest margin (NIM).   Noninterest income was the primary driver of WFC’s higher earnings. However,  unlike prior quarters the $300 million increase in noninterest income was not  propelled through the company’s mortgage banking operations. Instead,  noninterest income growth was positively impacted by a $252 million increase in  market sensitive revenue, predominantly in trading gains along with growth in  other fees and charges.   Fitch notes that WFC decided to retain close to $10 billion in conforming one to four family mortgages, forgoing around $200 million in additional noninterest  income. Absent the retention of these mortgages and planned loan run-off, core  loan growth was anemic at only 30 basis points (bps) on a sequential basis or  just 1% on an annualized basis.   The company also provided another $462 million related to mortgage loan  repurchase losses, down from $669 million in 2Q’12. Fitch continues to expect  that provisions for mortgage loan repurchase losses will remain a modest drag on earnings performance over coming periods.   Litigation risk remains elevated for the industry. Most recently, WFC was named  in a civil mortgage fraud lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice. The  DOJ complaint alleges violations of the False Claims Act and FIRREA related to  FHA loans. It is unclear what the ultimate outcome will be for WFC, but Fitch  expects any fine or penalty related to this suit will be manageable in the  context of WFC’s earnings profile.   A persistent low rate environment adversely impacted WFC’s NIM during 3Q’12.  After multiple quarters of a NIM north of 3.80%, it fell a significant 25 bps  from 3.91% in 2Q’12 to 3.66%. The company took in over $20 billion of deposits  in the third quarter which were deployed in low earning cash, short-term  investments, and loans. A sustained level of mortgage refinancing resulted in an increase in pay-downs on mortgage-backed securities, leaving WFC to reinvest  cash flows in lower yielding, shorter duration securities.   Total nonperforming assets (NPAs) increased $368 million during 3Q’12 which  included $1.4 billion related to new guidance from the OCC. Net charge-offs  (NCOs) climbed to $2.4 billion in the third quarter from $2.2 billion in the  second quarter primarily due to the new guidance. Excluding the effect of the  new guidance, charge-offs were $1.8 billion during the quarter.   The new OCC guidance directs financial institutions to move those performing  loans where the borrower’s obligation to the bank has been discharged in  bankruptcy and the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt to nonaccrual as well as write the loan down to the value of the underlying collateral.   Fitch notes that excluding the impact of the new guidance, underlying asset  quality slightly improved during 3Q’12 with total commercial and consumer  nonaccrual loans falling $1 billion from 2Q’12.  Fitch observes that capital ratios continue to be augmented through earnings  generation. WFC’s estimated Tier 1 leverage climbed 20 bps from 9.25% at 2Q’12  to 9.45% at 3Q’12. Risk-based capital ratios were mostly flat  quarter-over-quarter due to a slight increase in risk-weighted assets. Under  current Basel III proposals, WFC estimates its Tier 1 common equity ratio to be  8.02% up from 7.78% at 2Q’12.",10122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA743920121012
561,WFC,US STOCKS-Bank stocks drag Wall Street lower after earnings,"* Wells Fargo results weigh on financials, JPMorgan dips * AMD slumps after revenue warning * Consumer sentiment data beats expectations * Dow dips 0.1 pct, S&P; 500 off 0.4 pct, Nasdaq down 0.2 pct By Atossa Araxia Abrahamian NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday, led by financial stocks, after Wells Fargo & Co said quarterly revenue fell short of expectations. Shares of Wells Fargo shed 3.5 percent to $33.96 after reporting a quarterly revenue of $21.2 billion, which missed analysts’ forecasts, even as it earned a record profit. The shortfall prompted investors to sell other bank shares, including those of JPMorgan Chase & Co, which also reported a record profit for the quarter.  JPMorgan slid 1.6 percent to $41.40, while the KBW Bank index  lost 2.63 percent. Wells Fargo was hurt by a lower net interest margin - the difference between what it pays on deposits and makes on loans - and that margin could narrow further as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates ultra low. “A drop in interest margins suggests that the Federal Reserve’s lower interest rates are going to negatively impact bank profitability in the foreseeable future,” said Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management in Richmond, Virginia. Indeed, expectations are low in general for the S&P; 500 companies’ quarterly earnings. Overall, earnings are expected to fall 3 percent from a year ago, compared with a 2.1 percent drop estimated at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters data. The market drew little support from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary October reading on consumer sentiment, which rose to 83.1, well above a forecast 78. “We trade on the data and the market is suggesting it’s not as strong as it looks,” said Engelke. “If the economy was as strong as suggested by the data, equities would be up and the bond market would be traded a lot as well.” Despite several encouraging data points this week, the benchmark S&P; index has shed 2.2 percent in the week so far and is on track for its worst weekly performance since it fell 3 percent in the week ended June 1. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 15.15 points, or 0.11 percent, at 13,311.24. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dipped 5.31 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,427.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 5.50 points, or 0.18 percent, at 3,043.91. Advanced Micro Devices Inc fell 10.4 percent to $2.86 a day after the chipmaker said its third-quarter revenue probably fell 10 percent from the previous quarter as a weak global economy and a growing preference for tablets slams the PC industry. U.S.-listed shares of STMicroelectronics   shot up 7.1 percent to $6.07 after Bloomberg reported Europe’s top semiconductor maker was considering a breakup that could lead to the sale of its struggling mobile-phone chip business.

562,WFC,"Wells Fargo posts record quarterly profit, revs disappoint","(Reuters) - Low interest rates both hurt and helped third-quarter earnings at Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), boosting mortgage lending but squeezing core profitability more than analysts expected. Third-quarter net income rose 22 percent from a year ago to a record $4.9 billion, or 88 cents per share, the bank reported on Friday, topping the analysts’ consensus estimate of 87 cents, as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. But total revenue of $21.2 billion missed the $21.47 billion analysts expected. Net interest margin - the spread between what the bank pays on deposits and makes on loans - fell to 3.66 percent from 3.91 percent in the second quarter, a bigger drop than it warned of last month. Wells Fargo executives urged investors to focus on its overall profit rather than the shrinking net interest margin. Wall Street didn’t appear to listen as the stock fell more than 3 percent at midday. “We could easily have increased net interest margin by making bad decisions,” such as buying high-interest loans that are likely to default, Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said on a conference call with analysts. “We don’t spend a lot of time focused on managing to that margin.” Chief Executive John Stumpf said the bank, the biggest mortgage lender in the United States, is also rapidly boosting fee income by selling products and services that don’t depend on interest rates for loans. “Overall revenue is up 8 percent this year,” Stumpf said, while deposit growth is strong and bad loans and other expenses are declining. “Those are pretty good numbers.” Sloan conceded there “is no question that in this slow rate environment,” interest margin is under pressure and the trend could extend through next year. Shares in the fourth largest U.S. bank were off 3.4 percent at $34 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange. The KBW Bank Index .BKX of large banks, which includes Wells Fargo, was off 2.6 percent. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the largest U.S. bank, also reported results on Friday. It said profits rose 34 percent to a record $5.71 billion. Banks are experiencing shrinking margins as older loans with higher interest rates are paid down and they find fewer places to invest growing deposits. “The margin came in much worse than we expected, but mortgage banking was better,” Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Frederick Cannon wrote in a note to clients. “Overall, this was a slight beat this quarter, but the margin matters more.” Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenue jumped more than 50 percent from a year ago to $2.8 billion. The bank said it decided to retain $9.8 billion in mortgages it could have sold to Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB. It said it can make more on them than the potential $200 million of fee income it could have received. “Holding these mortgages today doesn’t preclude us (from) selling them in the future,” Sloan said, when asked if having them on the balance sheet could hurt its capital strength. The executives touted improvements in credit quality. Stumpf said he anticipates regulators will give the bank the go-ahead to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividend payments after they review an annual stress test starting in March. Stumpf said his first priority for excess capital, however, is to increase loans. Wells Fargo made $139 billion in mortgages versus $89 billion a year ago, but up only slightly from the second quarter. Total loans increased by $7.4 billion, or about 1 percent, from June 30 to $782.6 billion. Wells Fargo also saw increases in auto, credit card, student and commercial loans. The bank set aside less money for future loan losses than it actually charged off in the third quarter - a sign it believes credit quality is improving.

Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. home lender, lost 3.3 percent to $34.03 after its total quarterly revenue of $21.2 billion missed analysts’ forecasts.That shortfall prompted investors to sell other bank shares, in spite of a record quarterly profit reported on Friday by JPMorgan Chase & Co . Shares of JPMorgan slid 1 percent to $41.68. The KBW Bank index lost 2.5 percent. As a group, S&P; 500 companies’ quarterly earnings are expected to fall 3 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data, compared with a forecast calling for a 2.1 percent decline estimated at the beginning of the month. “Ultimately, what’s going to drive profits will be corporate earnings that come out over the next three weeks and how these earnings match up with expectations,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer of Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. The benchmark S&P; index is down 2.2 percent so far this week, putting it on track for its worst weekly performance since a 3 percent drop in the week that ended on June 1. “Expectations are low, and the hurdle has been set lower so from that standpoint, it shouldn’t be too difficult for companies to surpass.” The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary October reading on consumer sentiment rose to 83.1, well above the forecast for a reading of 78.

565,WFC,RPT-U.S. banks push back as financial-crisis lawsuits pile up,"* Officials sue Wells Fargo, JPMorgan * Wells Fargo says complaint overlaps previous settlement * JPMorgan says it did Fed “a favor” with Bear Stearns By Aruna Viswanatha and Rick Rothacker Oct 15 (Reuters) - As U.S. authorities seek to make Wall Street pay for its role in triggering the financial crisis more than four years ago, banks are starting to fight back, frustrated that they are being asked to pay more than once for the same conduct. The result may be that federal and state authorities trying to extract penalties from the banks are forced to go through lengthy courtroom battles, instead of getting hundreds of millions of dollars through relatively quick settlements. In the past two weeks, two of the biggest banks were hit with s eparate mortgage-related lawsuits. One from the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan accused Wells Fargo of misleading the government in a “longstanding and reckless” pattern of certifying the quality of questionable home loans and failing to report problems on others. It said the deception forced the government to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars in insurance claims. Authorities are seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages. Instead of quickly settling the charges, as has happened in most financial-crisis cases, Wells Fargo is contesting the allegations. Part of its defense will be that the $25 billion federal-state mortgage settlement reached earlier this year with top banks already cleared out some of this liability, Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said in an interview on Friday. “There was a lot of disappointment from our perspective in terms of how it was handled, and in particular we were very disappointed in some of the sensational allegations that were made,” Sloan said, adding that the bank strongly denies the charges. The earlier settlement covered a certification that Wells says is partly at issue in the new complaint. In the other case, New York State Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman last week filed a civil suit against JPMorgan for alleged fraud at Bear Stearns, which JPMorgan bought at the government’s request in 2008. JPMorgan is also fighting back against those charges. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon lashed out this week in Washington at a public event, saying his bank has already paid its price. It took on up to $10 billion in losses related to Bear Stearns for doing the Federal Reserve “a favor.” Rita Glavin, a former Justice Department official who is a partner at the law firm Seward & Kissel, said banks may be reaching a point where they don’t see the logic in settling cases because it’s not allowing them to move past the liability. “You may be seeing them saying, we’re going to draw a line in the sand, and we’re not simply going to lay down and get rolled over,” Glavin said. The strategy does come with some danger of new information being disclosed that private litigants can use in their own lawsuits against the banks. But the civil cases also indicate the banks will likely face no criminal charges for the same conduct, potentially giving the banks less reason to immediately resolve them. “If the banks have come to the determination that the worst that is going to happen is this civil case, then there is less of a downside for going forward,” said Neil Barofsky, former inspector general of the TARP bailout who now teaches at New York University School of Law. The Justice Department declined to comment. James Freedland, a spokesman for the New York Attorney General’s office, said about the JPMorgan case: “It would be the ultimate legal loophole if accountability for billions of dollars worth of fraud upon taxpayers and investors could simply disappear into the ether because ownership of a company changed hands.” Some see a pattern of fresh aggression from authorities, especially out of New York, where top enforcement officials are elected. New York state banking regulator Benjamin Lawsky, who was appointed by the governor, came under fire in August when he broke from federal investigators and threatened to yank British bank Standard Chartered’s state banking license over transactions tied to Iran. Not all expected action has panned out. Goldman Sachs faced potential action from the Securities and Exchange Commission for its role in selling certain subprime mortgage securities, after it already agreed in 2010 to $550 million to resolve SEC charges related to another subprime mortgage product. The bank disclosed in August the SEC had dropped its investigation. For years, government enforcers have been criticized for not being forceful enough in pursuing marquee Wall Street banks and bankers for recklessly churning out loans, then spreading around the risk by repackaging and selling securities backed by those loans. Earlier this year, President Barack Obama announced a new financial fraud task force. Bringing together federal and state enforcement efforts and avoid overlapping cases, it was billed as the most serious effort yet to bring high-level cases. New York state’s case against JPMorgan, for example, brought together the work of the Justice Department and investigators at the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s inspector general’s office. But JPMorgan still faces potential action from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which is probing activity at JPMorgan Securities related to two mortgage securitizations. JPMorgan disclosed that probe in February of this year, roughly eight months after JPMorgan Securities agreed to pay $153.6 million to settle charges it misled investors in a complex mortgage securities transaction. Wells Fargo also faces potential SEC action related to the housing crisis. The bank received notice it may face SEC action  related to its mortgage-backed securities offerings. “We need to come up with some type of global settlement and say, ‘The end. This is it.’ It’s just drip, drip, drip,” said Nancy Bush, a veteran bank analyst and contributing editor with SNL Financial. It’s difficult to determine how much liability is still out there and whether banks have put enough money away to cover it. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo both reported third-quarter results on Friday. Wells Fargo’s “operating losses,” an expense category that includes litigation, were $281 million in the third quarter, down nearly by half from the second quarter. The bank’s reserves take into account the suit from the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office, Sloan told analysts in a conference call.

It’s difficult to determine how much liability is still out there and whether banks have put enough money away to cover it. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo both reported third-quarter results on Friday. Wells Fargo’s “operating losses,” an expense category that includes litigation, were $281 million in the third quarter, down nearly by half from the second quarter. The bank’s reserves take into account the suit from the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office, Sloan told analysts in a conference call. JPMorgan reported litigation expenses of $800 million, up from $300 million in the last quarter but down from the $1.3 billion recorded one year ago.",10152012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-banks-enforcement/u-s-banks-push-back-as-financial-crisis-lawsuits-pile-up-idUSL1E8LCLEV20121015

568,WFC,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo raises share buyback authorization,"Oct 23 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, said its board had increased its stock repurchase authorization by 200 million shares. San Francisco-based Wells last increased its authorization to repurchase shares in March 2011. At the end of June, it had the remaining ability to buy back 56 million shares, according to its latest quarterly filing. Wells is one of the large U.S. banks that needs to pass an annual Federal Reserve stress test before returning capital to shareholders in the form of increased dividends or stock buybacks. After its most recent stress test in March, the bank said its capital plan called for a higher level of common stock repurchases in 2012 versus 2011. Banks are preparing for another round of stress tests that begin in January. The bank this month said it bought 17 million shares in the third quarter and planned to buy another 9 million in a transaction that settles in the fourth quarter. Wells spokesman Ancel Martinez declined to comment further on the bank’s stock buying plans. The bank has about 5.3 billion shares outstanding. Shares of the company were down 1.5 percent at $33.99 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Mark Teed, who has been in the industry for 25 years, managed $225 million in client assets at Wells Fargo, according to a news release from St. Petersburg, Florida-based Raymond James. Teed began his career at A.G. Edwards & Sons, and then stayed on when the firm became Wachovia in 2007 and then Wells Fargo & Co the following year. A Wells Fargo representative could not immediately confirm Teed’s move, which occurred last month, according to regulatory filings. Teed joined Raymond James & Associates, Raymond James’ traditional employee broker-dealer division. The company also has an independent broker-dealer that caters to advisers who function as business owners. Including the UK, Canada and custody businesses, Raymond James has about 6,300 advisers and representatives who manage roughly $390 billion client assets.

Cummings, who had previously been head of channel management for the managed solutions group at Merrill Lynch, joined Wells Fargo on Friday. He had been with Bank of America since 2006 and also previously led the firm’s institutional investments group. “One of my key drivers for coming over to Abbot Downing is the boutique (culture) and the ability to put the client front and center ... which is really what is needed in this client segment,” Cummings said in an interview. Cummings joined Abbot Downing, the newly branded ultra-high-net-worth wealth management unit Wells launched in April after combining its family wealth unit and Lowry Hill boutique subsidiary.

580,WFC,Wells expands in investment banking as others retreat,"CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - As banks across Wall Street retreat from the trading business, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) is expanding. The growth worries some investors who want the notoriously conservative bank to stick to its knitting, but Wells Fargo believes that now is a good time to hire. “Our eyes are wide open,” said John Shrewsberry, head of the bank’s investment banking and capital markets operations, known as Wells Fargo Securities. “There are a lot of very talented people at different stages of availability,” he added in an interview this week. The fourth-largest U.S. bank says it can earn solid returns in investment banking while taking little risk for itself. It is focusing on services that its corporate lending customers need, such as stock and bond underwriting and merger advice. For investors, it is looking at areas like processing futures and swaps trades. The bank shies away from riskier undertakings like trading for its own account. The Wells Fargo Securities unit is relatively small now. It’s biggest hub is in Charlotte, North Carolina, far from the storm that has hobbled Wall Street this week. In a few years, the unit could account for twice as much of the firm’s revenue as it does now - an estimated 10 percent compared to its current five, Deutsche Bank analyst Matt O’Connor wrote in a report in May. For JPMorgan Chase & Co, (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) that percentage is closer to 20 to 25 percent. A much bigger proportion of Wells Fargo’s revenue comes from traditional commercial and retail banking businesses: residential mortgages, lines of credit for corporations, and so on. Expanding into what is a relatively new area for the bank is worrisome for some investors, said veteran bank analyst Dick Bove of Rochdale Securities. “They’re saying that’s not your business. Therefore, you’re going to make mistakes. It’s going to cost us a lot of money,” Bove said. At a bank presentation for investors in May, Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf faced questions about why the bank needs to be in the business and whether it risks changing the company’s identity. Stumpf said the move was consistent with the bank’s strategy to provide more products and services to its customers. The bank has no specific targets for hiring, Shrewsberry said. The securities unit has a little more than 4,000 employees now, less than 2 percent of the company’s total. The unit has left itself with room to grow. In Charlotte, Wells is putting the finishing touches on a new trading floor, which has empty space where more desks can be added. The location came to Wells Fargo in 2008, when it acquired failing Wachovia on the cheap, picking up a mid-sized investment bank in the process. Wachovia was in the process of building a new headquarters in its hometown of Charlotte, when it was bought. The building was completed and is now known as the Duke Energy Center, but Wells did not decide to build the trading floor until last year. About 1,500 traders, bankers and support staff will start moving into the building from a nearby location in December. If traders need a reminder of the competition, they can glance out the window at the city’s pro football stadium, named for Charlotte-based Bank of America. Shrewsberry, 47, has been leading the combined business since the Wachovia merger. He joined Wells in 2001 when it bought the firm he co-founded, American Commercial Capital, which lent money to restaurant franchises. Before that, he worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Credit Suisse CSGN.VX. One growth area is a futures clearing and execution business, which the bank is expanding as it builds out a swaps clearing business required by new regulations, Shrewsberry said. Wells in April also agreed to buy Merlin Securities LLC in its foray into the business of providing trading, reporting and other services to hedge funds. The business, to be renamed Wells Fargo Prime Services, currently doesn’t lend to hedge funds, but Wells plans to add that capability, Shrewsberry said. The bank’s presence outside New York was helpful this week when Hurricane Sandy snarled the Northeast, closing U.S. markets for two days and shutting down New York offices for Wells and other banks. “Luckily we can shift a lot of activity to Charlotte,” Shrewsberry said. “We can shift activity to San Francisco. We have sales offices all around the country and the world for that matter that can pick up slack.” ",10312012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wellsfargo-investmentbanking/wells-expands-in-investment-banking-as-others-retreat-idUSBRE89U1SG20121031
581,WFC,"UPDATE 2-Wells Fargo fights new US suit, points to earlier pact","* Wells says suit conflicts with earlier mortgage settlement * Asks judge to find DOJ violated previous deal * Banks stepping up fight against financial crisis cases By Aruna Viswanatha WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo has gone to court to challenge a financial-crisis lawsuit recently brought against it by the Justice Department, saying a prior multi-bank $25 billion mortgage settlement already cleared it of some liability. The fourth-largest U.S. bank asked a federal judge in Washington on Thursday to rule that the U.S. violated the terms of the earlier settlement by filing its recent case in New York. The U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan sued Wells Fargo on Oct. 9 seeking damages and penalties for more than 10 years of alleged misconduct related to government-insured Federal Housing Administration loans. But an earlier consent judgment already “wiped the slate clean” for the bank in terms of certain conduct related to its FHA portfolio, Wells Fargo said in its Thursday court filing. In February, Wells Fargo and four other top banks agreed to $25 billion in penalties and relief to homeowners to resolve allegations about shoddy mortgage servicing practices. That settlement also addressed certain claims involving the bank’s annual certifications about its FHA compliance, Wells Fargo said. Comparing the new allegations with the earlier settlement “demonstrates without any doubt that the United States is attempting to impose additional liability for the same conduct for which Wells Fargo obtained permanent peace through the very large settlement”, the bank said. The new U.S. lawsuit includes allegations unrelated to the certification. The earlier settlement also did not cover all issues at the individual loan level, so any resolution might hinge on determining whether Wells Fargo submitted specific loans for government insurance even if it knew the loans failed to qualify. A spokeswoman for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. In the filing, lawyers for Wells Fargo said they had conferred with government attorneys, who said they would oppose the motion. As U.S. authorities seek to make Wall Street pay for its role in triggering the financial crisis more than four years ago, Wells Fargo and other banks are starting to fight back more often, arguing they are being asked to repeatedly pay for the same conduct. When Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara accused Bank of America last week of causing taxpayers more than $1 billion in losses by selling toxic mortgage loans to Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac, the bank said that at some point it could not “be expected to compensate every entity that claims losses that actually were caused by the economic downturn.” Also last week, Democratic Congressman Barney Frank defended JPMorgan Chase & Co and said the government was wrong to go after it for the alleged misdeeds of Bear Stearns, which the largest U.S. bank acquired at the government’s urging. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued the bank last month over mortgage-backed securities packaged and sold by Bear Stearns. Through its action on Thursday, Wells Fargo said it is seeking an order barring the government from pursuing certain claims included in the new lawsuit. The bank said it is also seeking other relief to “compensate Wells Fargo for the injuries suffered as a result of the repetitive litigation” from the new U.S. lawsuit.",11012012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-lawsuit/update-2-wells-fargo-fights-new-us-suit-points-to-earlier-pact-idUSL1E8M18P320121101

583,WFC,Wells Fargo sees more opportunity in refinancings,"(Reuters) - A significant portion of customers in Wells Fargo & Co’s (WFC.N) $1.9 trillion mortgage servicing portfolio remain strong candidates for refinancings, the head of the bank’s home lending unit said on Thursday. More than 40 percent of customers in the portfolio have home loans with interest rates above 4 percent, strong credit scores and equity in their home, Mike Heid said at an investor conference. “The opportunity is there,” Heid said, reiterating previous statements by the bank that a U.S. mortgage refinancing boom spurred by low rates could last several more quarters. The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets uses the portfolio data to gauge the potential for future refinancings, but Heid cautioned that not everyone will choose to refinance or use Wells Fargo for their new loan. Mortgage refinancings have helped boost earnings at Wells and other U.S. banks in recent quarters. Wells, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, had $97 billion in unclosed home loans entering the fourth quarter, which Heid called a strong starting point. Pointing to stabilizing home prices and home sales, Heid said the “housing market is definitely showing signs of recovery.” Earlier this month, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon said the housing market had “turned the corner.” Asked about the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the bank’s mortgage business, Heid said much of the credit risk in the bank’s portfolio would be passed onto investors who own the loans, such as mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB. He encouraged customers who will have problems making payments to contact the bank. (Reporting By Rick Rothacker in Charlotte, North Carolina; Editing by Gerald E.

590,WFC,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo expands commercial banking in Canada,"* No. 4 U.S. bank targeting 20 countries for growth * Focus on serving U.S. customers abroad * Foreign loans equal about 5 percent of total By Rick Rothacker Nov 6 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co is ramping up commercial lending and treasury management operations in Canada as part of an international expansion that will eventually reach 20 countries outside the United States. The No. 4 U.S. bank by assets on Tuesday said it’s adding wholesale business lines in Canada after receiving a license in September that allows it to make loans to and take deposits from corporate customers but not consumers. Canada is the ninth country where the bank has increased capabilities to serve businesses outside the United States in a plan that will take about three years, said Rajnish Bharadwaj, Wells Fargo’s head of cross border governance. The bank is targeting locations in Europe, Asia and eventually Latin America. “Canada is one of our more significant opportunities,” Bharadwaj said. Foreign loans equaled about 5 percent of Wells Fargo’s total loans and 3 percent of total assets as of June 30, according to the bank’s most recent quarterly securities filing. Wells doesn’t provide a breakdown by county, but Canada is in the top five, Bharadwaj said. The bank’s international business could double over the next five years, but the percentage of assets and loans shouldn’t change much as the rest of the company grows, he said. Overall, Wells has offices in 37 countries, offering services such as trade finance. The San Francisco-based bank previously had select businesses in Canada such as asset-based lending and equipment finance, but under its new license it will now have commercial banking, global banking, commercial real estate and energy banking businesses in the country. The bank has added 25 employees in its banking operations and will likely double that over the next year, said Rick Valade, Wells’ country manager for Canada. Overall, it has about 75 people in offices in Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal. Foreign banks generally have had a tough time gaining scale in the Canadian banking industry, which is dominated by five large domestic lenders that are protected from takeovers by federal laws. While a handful of U.S. banks operate small subsidiaries in the country - Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp  among them - the trend in the wake of the financial crisis has been for them to sell off non-core Canadian assets rather than add. Indeed, Wells Fargo shut down its Canadian consumer lending business in 2010. Wells will aim to serve existing U.S. customers with subsidiaries in Canada, Canadian companies with business in the United States and local Canadian companies. “We very much respect the Canadian banks,” Valade said. “We’re not looking to compete directly with them. In most circumstances, we’re truly taking our customer relationships that we have in the U.S. and being able to service those needs in Canada.” Wells Fargo shares rose 35 cents in morning trading to $34.37.",11062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-canada/update-1-wells-fargo-expands-commercial-banking-in-canada-idUSL1E8M66L920121106

593,WFC,"ON THE MOVE-Wells Fargo broker team goes independent, joins LPL","Nov 7 (Reuters) - After more than three decades working at major Wall Street brokerages, veteran Reno-based adviser Mark Elston has decided to take his book of business independent. Elston, previously an adviser with Wells Fargo & Co’s  Wells Fargo Advisors, joined the independent advisory firm Legacy Wealth Planning in October. He was formerly a managing director of investments at Wells, where he managed roughly more than $200 million in client assets with his team. “I just really felt that this is the right time in my career,” said Elston, who started in the industry in the late 1970s with Dean Witter Reynolds. He was joined by his son Jim Elston, fellow adviser David Quinn and client services assistant Tiffany Del Santo, who also moved with Elston from Wells. Elston said he made the move in part to be able to advise his clients independently from the pressures of a larger company. Advisers at big bank-owned brokerages often say there is a perceived pressure to cross-sell the bank’s loans and services. Elston’s new firm, Legacy Wealth Planning, is run by Elston and his team, in partnership with the independent broker-dealer LPL Financial. “The reason I joined LPL in particular was the benefit of joining a firm that has no bias,” Elston said. Boston-based LPL Financial, a subsidiary of LPL Financial Holdings Inc, provides brokerage, clearing and other professional services to roughly 13,100 self-employed brokers and advisers like Elston. Legacy Wealth Planning, based in Reno, was founded in March 2006 by advisers Phillip Mahoney, Mark Levy, Christopher Vargas and Martin McClellan.",11072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo/on-the-move-wells-fargo-broker-team-goes-independent-joins-lpl-idUSL1E8M7E9V20121107

Adviser Bruce Scott Wilson moved on Friday to Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, or “FiNet,” the company’s broker-dealer catering to independent advisers who also function as business owners, Wells said. Wilson managed $110 million in client assets at Morgan Stanley. A client base of that size typically translates to around $1.1 million in annual revenue production, according to industry recruiters. Wilson, who had been an adviser at Citigroup Smith Barney, joined Morgan Stanley Wealth Management after the merger of Citi’s Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley’s wealth businesses in 2009. Wilson was based out of Morgan Stanley’s Rutland, Vermont office. Morgan Stanley confirmed the departure, but declined to comment further. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo & Co, which also has a traditional employee broker-dealer and banking division, has the third-largest U.S. brokerage by client assets, after Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Merrill Lynch.

Wells’ brokerage business, based in St. Louis, has more than 15,000 advisers with about $1.2 trillion in client assets among its brokerage subsidiaries.

The new recruits, who joined Wells earlier in November, came from Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and UBS Wealth Management Americas. The advisers joined Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, or “FiNet,” which caters to independent advisers who also function as business owners. “We wanted to run our own business,” said California-based adviser Michael Kazmer, who decided to go independent after roughly three decades in the advising industry. Kazmer, who managed $620 million in client assets with fellow advisers Larry Bernstein and Abby Dinkins, moved with his team from Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch. “We looked at the depth and the reputation and the market cap of Wells Fargo, and it gave us a sense of comfort,” Kazmer said in an interview about his decision to go independent with Wells. The advisers formed the KBT Group and are based in Westlake Village, a wealthy community in the greater Los Angeles area. Also on the move, advisers Bryan Pieper and Gregory Stringari joined Wells’ FiNet from Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, the brokerage majority owned by Morgan Stanley  and partially owned by Citigroup. The advisers, based in Colorado, managed $270 million in client assets. They joined Wells’ office in Louisville - located just outside of Boulder - and formed the Trailhead Wealth Management group. In Connecticut, adviser Michelle Lavigne moved to Wells from UBS Wealth Management Americas, the brokerage owned by the Swiss bank UBS AG . Lavigne, who had been at UBS for more than a decade, managed $128 million in client assets at the firm. She joined the existing FiNet practice Adaptive Wealth Management. Wells also said it added Vermont-based adviser Bruce Scott Wilson to its FiNet division, as previously reported by Reuters.

602,WFC,New York warns Wells Fargo about Sandy mortgage delays,"(Reuters) - New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on Friday warned Wells Fargo & Co that the U.S. bank’s policy to delay mortgage modification decisions in states affected by Hurricane Sandy likely violates a national mortgage settlement. Schneiderman said his office has been contacted by lawyers representing homeowners in New York who have been notified by the bank that it’s suspending decisions on loan modifications until it receives information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Under a $25 billion settlement reached in February, Wells Fargo and four other banks agreed to new loan servicing standards, including a requirement to make decisions on loan modification requests within 30 days of receiving a completed application. Loan modifications typically reduce monthly payments for borrowers in danger of foreclosure. “Wells Fargo is not excused from any of its obligations under the National Mortgage Settlement or under New York law as a result of Hurricane Sandy,” Schneiderman wrote in a letter to the bank. “My office will aggressively pursue any loan servicing company that uses this tragic event as an excuse to violate loss mitigation decision timelines.” Wells Fargo spokeswoman Vickee Adams said there is a “misunderstanding” over the bank’s policy. “We are here to do what we can for our customers,” she said. “We are here to help them.” Wells Fargo began suspending all foreclosures in FEMA declared disaster areas immediately after Sandy made landfall, Adams said. The suspension will last at least 90 days for loans owned by the bank. Loans serviced for others will follow investor guidelines.

607,WFC,Wells Fargo says it won't face SEC action on mortgages,"(Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators have dropped an inquiry into Wells Fargo & Co mortgage securities offerings, the bank said in a securities filing on Wednesday. The staff at the Securities and Exchange Commission notified the bank on November 20 that it closed its investigation and doesn’t plan to recommend an enforcement action, the bank said in the filing. In February, the No. 4 U.S. bank by assets received a so-called Wells notice from the SEC over disclosures provided in certain mortgage-backed securities offerings. Such notices usually indicate the agency plans to take some kind of enforcement action and gives firms a chance to respond. The SEC even took Wells to court in March to enforce subpoenas it said the bank had repeatedly ignored. The agency had said in a court filing that it was investigating possible fraud in connection with the bank’s sale of nearly $60 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities to investors. The SEC and Wells Fargo declined to comment on Wednesday. The SEC has been slowly churning out cases involving mortgage securities tied to the financial crisis, including entering into $417 million in settlements earlier this month with JPMorgan Chase & Co and Credit Suisse Group AG. But it has also dropped other cases it initially planned to charge. In August it told Goldman Sachs Group it closed an investigation into the bank’s role in selling $1.3 billion worth of subprime mortgage securities.

608,WFC,SAC Capital says it could be charged by SEC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government is considering filing civil charges against SAC Capital Advisors over an insider trading case as regulators tighten the screws around Steven A. Cohen, the $14 billion hedge fund’s founder and one of the industry’s most famous traders. Cohen and a top SAC executive told investors on a 20-minute conference call on Wednesday that the Securities and Exchange Commission recently had issued a formal warning called a Wells notice to the firm indicating charges are likely, according to two sources, who listened to the call. The move by the SEC comes a week after federal prosecutors and regulators charged one of SAC Capital’s former employees with running one of the most lucrative insider trading schemes ever. Authorities have not charged Cohen with wrongdoing but they contend he signed off on the trades. For years, Cohen and SAC have been dogged by allegations that the firm has relied on insider information to deliver an average annual return of 30 percent since Cohen founded it in 1992. Until this point, the SEC had taken no steps toward bringing a civil complaint against the hedge fund. The sources said Cohen, 56, spoke briefly at the beginning of the phone call. Then, he let his top deputy, SAC President Tom Conheeney, handle the remainder, which one of the two people who listened in described as “carefully scripted.” Callers were not able to ask questions. People familiar with the potential civil charges against SAC Capital said the charges appear to be related to last week’s arrest of Mathew Martoma, who worked for CR Intrinsic, a SAC Capital division, until 2010. Last week the SEC filed civil charges against Martoma and sought disgorgement of profits from CR Intrinsic, but did not mention SAC Capital by name. Securities lawyers said regulators may be looking to file civil charges against SAC Capital since it is entity that controls CR Intrinsic. The possibility the SEC could now file civil charges against SAC Capital might further unnerve investors in the hedge fund. Martoma is the fifth person once associated with the hedge fund to be charged with insider trading. Over the past week, SAC Capital has been reaching out to its biggest investors and held a staff meeting last week to allay fears about the firm’s future. The sources on the call said it appears the firm had been aware that the SEC was considering this move for some time. A SAC Capital spokesman reiterated the statement the firm made last week following Martoma’s arrest. In that statement, the firm said: “Mr. Cohen and SAC are confident that they have acted appropriately.” On the SEC’s investment advisory website, where all hedge funds must now register, SAC Capital recently updated its filing to note that the SEC had named CR Intrinsic, the unit where Martoma worked, as a defendant in last week’s civil complaint. The firm, however, did not update the online filing to show that it had received a Wells notice. Authorities charged Martoma with using illegally obtained information from a doctor about poor clinical results at two healthcare companies - Elan Corp Plc and Wyeth, which is now owned by Pfizer Inc - to recommend that SAC eliminate a big position in their stocks. This recommendation kept the firm from incurring millions of dollars in losses, the government said. Cohen has not been accused of wrongdoing. Some on Wall Street applauded SAC Capital for saying it had received the notice, a fact not always disclosed by investment firms who get them. “The best way to run a money management business, especially post-Madoff, is to let your investors know as much as possible, almost as if you’re in a glass bowl. The more transparency you can provide, the better,” said Jason Ader, a former Wall Street gaming analyst who now runs Ader Investment Management, which invests in hedge funds. While 60 percent of SAC’s $14 billion in assets belong to Cohen and his employees, the fund’s strong and steady returns have made it popular with outside investors as well. Blackstone Group LP has been a long-term investor. With so much of the money in SAC coming from wealthy investors, the firm may not suffer from the kind of redemptions that a fund dependent on pension fund money might. How investors will react to this news, however, is still far from certain, people familiar with SAC said. One key may be what Blackstone Group’s big fund of funds does, as it once had up to $500 million in SAC and is something of a bellwether in the hedge fund industry. Blackstone’s investors include smaller and midsize endowments that might get itchy about SAC’s Wells notice and pressure the fund of funds to pull its money from the firm. A spokesman for Blackstone did not return a call seeking a comment. On the conference call, Conheeney, SAC’s president, again told investors that the firm would bear all costs of defending itself against any legal action, the source said. Conheeney also said the SEC had questioned Cohen about this matter earlier this year and that he had been responsive to all the government’s questions. The FBI has been investigating SAC on and off since 2007. Despite SAC’s outstanding returns, the firm’s reputation as a rough-and-tumble trading shop has sometimes prompted advisers to tell clients to get out or steer clear of the hedge fund. Todd Petzel, chief investment officer of Offit Capital Advisors, said he had never invested with SAC because of a lack of transparency, even though he knows of the firm’s “incredibly demanding culture” through interactions with Cohen and former SAC employees. “SAC will tell you that they have incredibly rigorous compliance process,” Petzel said. “I’m sure if this ever comes to court, they will demonstrate in court all the training that every one of their portfolio managers goes through.” On the other hand, he said Cohen probably protected himself by distancing himself from day-to-day activities. The SEC usually issues Wells notices to give firms plenty of warning that legal action is coming. In the last year, hedge fund manager Philip Falcone and his Harbinger Capital Partners said they had received such notices. “Certainly the Wells process and the public disclosure that there is a Wells process with respect to a hedge fund is something that is very challenging for the management of the hedge fund,” said Stephen Crimmins, a partner in law firm K&L; Gates in Washington. Cohen and his top-flight legal team will probably work around the clock to try to negotiate a resolution and avoid a civil lawsuit, Crimmins said. “It’s a period of intense activity,” he said. “It’s a period that usually doesn’t last that long, so we should expect some more news from SAC.” ",11282012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hedgefunds-sac-insidertrading/sac-capital-says-it-could-be-charged-by-sec-idUSBRE8AR0NY20121128
609,WFC,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo says it won't face SEC action on mortgages,"Nov 28 (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators have dropped an inquiry into Wells Fargo & Co mortgage securities offerings, the bank said in a securities filing on Wednesday. The staff at the Securities and Exchange Commission notified the bank on Nov. 20 that it closed its investigation and doesn’t plan to recommend an enforcement action, the bank said in the filing. In February, the No. 4 U.S. bank by assets received a so-called Wells notice from the SEC over disclosures provided in certain mortgage-backed securities offerings. Such notices usually indicate the agency plans to take some kind of enforcement action and gives firms a chance to respond. The SEC even took Wells to court in March to enforce subpoenas it said the bank had repeatedly ignored. The agency  had said in a court filing that it was investigating possible fraud in connection with the bank’s sale of nearly $60 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities to investors. The SEC and Wells Fargo declined to comment on Wednesday. The SEC has been slowly churning out cases involving mortgage securities tied to the financial crisis, including entering into $417 million in settlements earlier this month with JPMorgan Chase & Co and Credit Suisse Group AG. But it has also dropped other cases it initially planned to charge. In August it told Goldman Sachs Group it closed an investigation into the bank’s role in selling $1.3 billion worth of subprime mortgage securities.",11282012,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-sec/update-1-wells-fargo-says-it-wont-face-sec-action-on-mortgages-idUSL1E8MSFFM20121128

613,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Merrill Lynch lands 10 advisers from rival brokerages,"Nov 29 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp said on Thursday that its Merrill Lynch brokerage had added 10 veteran advisers across the United States from rival units at Morgan Stanley, UBS AG  and Wells Fargo & Co . The new hires, who joined Merrill in October and November, managed more than $1 billion in client assets at their old firms and had a combined production of $7.7 million in annual revenue. In Kentucky, advisers Charles Mercer, Marguerite Rowland and Dowell Ryan moved to Merrill from UBS Wealth Management Americas, the brokerage owned by Swiss bank UBS AG. The team, based in Louisville, managed $265.3 million in client assets at the firm and generated $2.4 million in annual revenue last year. In California, adviser Jeffrey Wells moved to Merrill from Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, the brokerage majority owned by Morgan Stanley and that has Citigroup as a minority owner. Wells managed $264 million in client assets and generated $1.5 million in annual revenue last year. He is based in Merrill’s Mill Valley office. In Connecticut, adviser Keith Ward also joined Merrill from Morgan Stanley, where he managed $136.3 million in client assets and had a production of $1.6 million in revenue last year. He is based out of Merrill’s Greenwich office. In Washington, D.C., adviser John Forster moved to Merrill from Morgan Stanley. Forster, who has worked in the advising industry for roughly three decades, managed about $110 million in client assets and generated $500,000 in revenue last year. In Red Bank, New Jersey, Merrill added three advisers from Morgan Stanley. Raymond Abbate managed $102 million in client assets at Morgan Stanley, while Bob Reinert and Craig Reinert managed $92 million. Also on the move, adviser Terry Schurman joined Merrill’s Ponte Vedra, Florida office from  Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage owned by Wells Fargo & Co. Schurman managed about $102 million in client assets. UBS confirmed the departures but did not comment further. Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the departures. Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, Wells Fargo Advisors and UBS Wealth Management Americas are among the top U.S. brokerages by client assets.

The suits were filed in U.S. District Court in Northern California in 2010 on behalf of Wells Fargo and its shareholders against current and former directors and executives largely related to conduct at Wachovia bank, which Wells bought in 2008. The suits claim that from 2005 to 2008 the former Wachovia defendants disregarded “their fundamental responsibilities” with respect to Wachovia’s acquisition of mortgage lender Golden West Financial and other activities at Wachovia, according to settlement documents. The suits also allege that Wells directors did not pursue “valuable claims” that it inherited in the Wachovia acquisition, according to the documents. Wells bought Wachovia as the lender verged on collapse due to ballooning mortgage losses and a run on its deposits. All the defendants denied wrongdoing and filed motions to dismiss, according to the documents. A hearing will be held on the settlement on March 5, according to Friday’s filing by Wells with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The governance changes include a requirement that the risk committee of the Wells Fargo board hire an outside consultant for three years.

621,WFC,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo doesn't have to pay clients $203 mln-court,"By Dan Levine SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court vacated an injunction and a $203 million restitution order against Wells Fargo & Co in consumer litigation over the bank’s overdraft policies, according to a ruling issued on Wednesday. But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco also found Wells had violated part of California’s unfair competition law, and sent the case back to trial court in San Francisco to determine what relief is appropriate. Representatives for the plaintiffs and Wells Fargo could not  be immediately reached for comment. Wells Fargo, prior to April 2001, posted customer debit card purchases to their bank accounts in order of lowest charge to highest, which minimized the number of overdrafts, according to the ruling. But beginning in April 2001, the bank began posting debit card purchase from highest to lowest, which maximized the number of overdrafts, the 9th Circuit wrote. A San Francisco federal judge certified a class action on behalf of Wells Fargo customers, who incurred overdraft fees because of high-to-low sequencing. The judge then issued an injunction ordering the bank to cease the practice, as well as a $203 million restitution award. In its ruling, the 9th Circuit found that federal law preempted part of the California statute on which the injunction was based. “Federal law does not, however, preempt California consumer law with respect to fraudulent or misleading representations concerning posting,” the court wrote.

625,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Benjamin Edwards adds advisers from Wells Fargo,"Jan 7 (Reuters) - Benjamin F. Edwards & Co, a boutique brokerage with family ties to the old A.G. Edwards & Sons, has opened an office in the greater Chicago area with three veteran advisers who joined the firm from Wells Fargo & Co. Adviser Dennis Anderson, who had been a senior vice president at Wells Fargo Advisors, joined Benjamin Edwards on Friday as branch manager of the new office in Woodstock. “This isn’t something we do very often,” Anderson said in an interview on Monday, noting that this was the first time in his two-decade advising career that he has switched firms. Anderson said his close ties with the firm’s founder and chief executive, Benjamin “Tad” Edwards, who had been his regional manager earlier in his career, contributed to his decision to move. Another reason was the similar culture that he said existed at the firm, which reminded him of his A.G. Edwards roots. Anderson, who started his career at A.G. Edwards in 1992, joined Wells in 2008 after the company acquired Wachovia, which one year earlier had bought A.G. Edwards. “Both firms have always believed that the client is the reason we’re all here,” said Anderson, referring to the A.G. Edwards and the new Benjamin Edwards. “The transition has been an enormous amount of work, but one of the most positive things that I can remember in some time,” he said. Adviser James Wormley and his son, Ryan Wormley, also joined Benjamin Edwards’ Woodstock office, where Anderson is branch manager. The two advisers, who joined the firm as senior vice presidents, were also legacy A.G. Edwards advisers. Since its founding in 2008, St. Louis-based Benjamin Edwards has expanded its adviser base by hiring dozens of legacy A.G. Edwards advisers from Wells. Anderson was joined by assistant branch manager Jenny Murray, while the Wormley team was joined by senior registered financial associate Sandy Shay and financial associate Matt Wormley.

626,WFC,"ON THE MOVE-Wells Fargo duo goes independent, joins Raymond James","Jan 7 (Reuters) - Raymond James Financial Inc has bolstered its independent adviser footprint in Maryland with a veteran duo that joined the broker-dealer from Wells Fargo & Co . After more than three decades in the brokerage industry, adviser Carolyn Meakem and her daughter Traci Meakem Richmond moved to Raymond James to open their own practice. The duo, based just outside of Washington, D.C. in the Maryland suburb of Bethesda, managed more than $200 million in client assets and had $2 million in annual revenue production at Wells Fargo. “We knew it was going to be a big investment and risk with the transition, and we feel it’s been well worth it to have our clients feel better,” said Richmond in an interview on Monday. Richmond said a part of their decision to move was to break away from the big bank-brokerage model, which was a point of frustration for some of their clients who disliked the idea of keeping their assets with a company that received government bailout money. “They were really glad to hear that Raymond James didn’t take TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) money,” she said. “Clients just really don’t like that.” Wells Fargo declined to comment on the departure. The Meakem Group, as the advisers now call their independent firm, joined Raymond James Financial Services Inc, the company’s independent broker-dealer division which caters to advisers who also function as business owners. Richmond said the biggest change has been the ease of access to senior management at Raymond James, which is based in St. Petersburg, Florida. “It couldn’t have been easier to access the upper level and that was the marked difference,” she said. And the move has already begun to pay off. Richmond said in the roughly three months since they joined Raymond James, she and her mom have already added two new clients who said they decided to join as a result of their move. Raymond James last year added at least 54 veteran advisers who managed roughly $5.9 billion in client assets at their old firms. More than half of those new recruits came from large bank-owned brokerages. The company also has a traditional employee broker-dealer division in the United States and smaller brokerage units in Canada and Britain. Together with its broker-dealer subsidiaries, Raymond James has more than 6,300 advisers managing $389 billion in client assets.",1072013,http://www.reuters.com/article/raymond-james/on-the-move-wells-fargo-duo-goes-independent-joins-raymond-james-idUSL1E9C73EZ20130107
627,WFC,Wells Fargo profit jumps but mortgage lending slips,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) on Friday said fourth-quarter profit rose 24 percent to a record high as the bank set aside less money to cover bad loans and made more fees from mortgages. But lending margins declined and the bank made fewer mortgage loans than in the third quarter, and its shares closed down 0.8 percent at $35.10. Wells is the first big U.S. bank to report fourth-quarter results, and its report reflects how banks are relying more on fees from mortgages and service charges to increase revenue, and less on interest income. Low interest rates are pressing on the profit banks make from interest. But fees from mortgages may help the bank less in the future. The bank’s pipeline of applications for home loans that have not yet closed was $81 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, down from $97 billion at the end of the third quarter. Wells issued $125 billion in mortgages during the fourth quarter, compared with $139 billion in the third quarter. In an interview, Wells Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said the bank made fewer mortgage loans in the fourth quarter mostly due to a decision to stop making loans through brokers. The volume of loans under way but not yet closed is still among the highest in the bank’s history, he said. “Assuming rates stay about where they are or even pick up just a little bit, it’s reasonable to assume we will still have healthy, strong originations in the mortgage business,” Sloan said. Wells, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank and the nation’s largest home lender, said fees from mortgages climbed nearly 30 percent from a year ago to $3.1 billion as homeowners continued to refinance their homes at low interest rates. The Mortgage Bankers Association has forecast that banks will make fewer loans in 2013 than 2012, and then fewer again in 2014, with a drop in refinancings more than offsetting an increase in loans to purchase homes. Wells’ lower mortgage applications and originations are “a wake-up call to the investment community that this isn’t going to go on forever,” said Scott Siefers, analyst with Sandler O’Neill. “It’s a mounting headwind no doubt about that.” Wells Fargo’s net interest margin - a closely watched measure of loan profitability - fell to 3.56 percent from 3.66 percent in the third quarter, but the decline was less severe than the drop from the second to the third quarter. Banks are seeing their margins shrink as older loans with higher interest rates are paid down. Wells Fargo provision for loan losses fell to $1.8 billion from about $2 billion as borrowers continued to do a better job of making their payments. Net income was $5.1 billion, or 91 cents a share, compared with $4.1 billion, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest results included a previously announced pre-tax charge of $644 million for Wells Fargo’s share of an $8.5 billion settlement that ends a U.S. government-mandated review of financial crisis-era foreclosures. Analysts’ average earnings forecast on Friday was 89 cents per share, excluding gains from equity investments and expenses from several one-time items, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On that basis, Wells earned 92 cents, according to I/B/E/S. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) report quarterly results next week. Wells Fargo’s total loans increased 2 percent from the third quarter to $799.6 billion, helped by a decision to hold onto $9.7 billion in mortgages that it could have sold to mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB. That move cost the bank $340 million in fees in the fourth quarter - mortgage fees it would have received from Fannie and Freddie - but will provide it with interest income over the longer term. Wells took a similar action in the third quarter, saying the mortgages would provide a better return than other investments it could make. With over 30 percent market share through the first nine months of 2012, Wells was the top U.S. mortgage lender, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a publication that tracks the industry. JPMorgan Chase was second with 10 percent. Wells Fargo’s total fourth-quarter revenue rose 7 percent to $21.9 billion, driven by an increase in fees. The bank, which has added new monthly fees on checking accounts that were once free, brought in $159 million more in service charges from deposit accounts in the fourth quarter than a year ago. Income from interest fell. Total expenses were up 3 percent to $12.9 billion. The bank blamed the foreclosure-related charge and a contribution to its charitable foundation. Wells repurchased 42 million of its shares during the quarter and has a contract to buy back another 6 million in the current quarter. Big U.S. banks are undergoing Federal Reserve stress tests that will determine whether they can raise dividends and buy back more shares this year. In a conference call with analysts, Sloan said the bank had asked the Fed for permission to return more capital to shareholders in 2013 than in 2012.

629,WFC,TEXT - S&P; says Wells Fargo & Co ratings unaffected by Q4 results,"Jan 11 - Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services today said its ratings on Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) are unaffected by the company’s strong fourth-quarter results, which were in line with our expectations.  Relative to the fourth quarter of 2011, total revenues were up 7% to $21.9  billion, pretax, preprovision profit was up 12% to $9.1 billion, core loans  were up 7.3% to $705 billion, average deposits were up 7% to $976 billion, net  charge-offs were down to 1.05% from 1.36%, and reserve releases continued but  at a lower level ($250 million versus $600 million last year). Finally,  estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity was up to 8.2% from 7.5% last year.  The quarter included a higher-than-expected 10 basis-point decrease in the net  interest margin (NIM), compared with the third quarter, partly because of a  larger-than-anticipated growth in deposits, partly as a result of seasonal  factors and the investment of these deposits into high-quality, short-term  investments. Additionally, the company took a $644 million charge to settle  ongoing and industrywide mortgage foreclosure abuses with the Office of the  Controller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve.    Our expectations, based on our calculation, for 2013 include an increase in  payouts to shareholders to more than 40% after the Comprehensive Capital  Analysis and Review results are announced, and we also expect continued modest  improvements in revenues, earnings, and credit measures and capital as the  U.S. economy continues its slow recovery.  The negative rating outlook on WFC reflects the outlook on the U.S. sovereign  rating, given the extraordinary government support we incorporate into our  issuer credit rating on WFC. If we were to lower the U.S. sovereign rating by  one notch to ‘AA’, we would also lower the issuer credit rating on WFC because  we would remove the one notch of support we currently factor into the rating.  Similarly, we could revise our outlook on WFC to stable if we were to revise  our outlook on the U.S. sovereign rating to stable. Otherwise, we view WFC’s  fundamental credit trends as stable.",1112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNB304720130111
630,WFC,TEXT - Fitch comments on Wells Fargo & Co,"Jan 11 - Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) once again reported a record quarter with net income of $5.1 billion for the fourth quarter 2012 (4Q’12) for a strong ROA of 1.46%, according to Fitch Ratings.   Results included three one-time items during the quarter. First, WFC reported  $644 million in pre-tax charges stemming from the settlement agreement with  regulators, which immediately ends the independent foreclosure review programs  required as part of the April 2011 consent orders. WFC, in addition to nine  other mortgage servicers, participated in the settlement, which brings to an end individual loan file reviews. Also impacting results, WFC contributed $250  million to the Wells Fargo Foundation during the quarter. Lastly, WFC realized a $332 million tax benefit associated with a previously written-down Wachovia life insurance investment.   Strong deposit inflows continue to pressure the net interest margin (NIM), which was down 10bps during the quarter, following a much steeper decline of 25bps in  3Q’12. The company took in a significant $51 billion in deposits in 4Q’12 and  over $20 billion of deposits in the third quarter. During these quarters,  period-end loans were up just $17 million and $7 million, respectively. Without  attractive higher-yielding investment opportunities, this excess liquidity  compressed the margin (8bps of the 10bps compression in 4Q’12 alone).  Positively, WFC continues to report further declines in deposit costs to just  16bps in 4Q’12.   Similar to last quarter, WFC again retained approximately $10 billion of 1 - 4  family conforming mortgage production, somewhat dampening the contribution from  mortgage banking by forgoing around $340 million in additional mortgage  revenues. Absent the retention of these mortgages in both quarters, core loan  growth was stronger during the quarter, up 3% on a sequential basis versus  essentially no growth last quarter, and helped to keep spread income flat on a  sequential basis.   Noninterest income was positively impacted by strong gains from equity  investments, including the gain on the sale of Becker Underwood. These gains  helped to offset weaker trading and losses on debt securities. Revenues were  also aided by solid growth in investment banking and retail brokerage  asset-based fees and mortgage banking. Mortgage originations, applications, and  the pipeline all declined during the quarter, but remain strong. Fitch  nonetheless expects mortgage activity to slow, and the contribution of mortgage  banking to WFC’s earnings to lessen over time.  Excluding the foreclosure review settlement charge and charitable contribution,  core expenses were approximately $12 billion, slightly down from last quarter.   Positively, there were no surprises in mortgage repurchase expenses, with the  pipeline and mortgage repurchase provision expenses lower for the quarter.  Reserve coverage of unresolved claims improved to approximately 113% at YE2012.  Fitch continues to expect that provisions for mortgage loan repurchase losses  will remain a modest drag on earnings performance over coming periods.   Asset quality improvement slowed during the quarter. Excluding the noise related to the OCC guidance that went into effect last quarter, core net charge-offs  were $1.8 billion during the quarter, roughly flat from last quarter. Provision  expenses were up on a linked-quarter basis, the first time in three quarters.  Excluding the NCOs related to the OCC guidance, there was no release reserve in  4Q’12, per Fitch’s calculations, as provision expense of $1.8 billion exceeded  adjusted NCOs. Nonetheless, this is in line with Fitch’s expectations for  dwindling reserve releases for the industry.   Capital ratios continue to be augmented through earnings generation. WFC’s  estimated Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III improved to 8.2% up from 8.0% at  3Q’12.",1112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNB304420130111
631,WFC,Wells Fargo boosts adviser force as rivals' numbers decline,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s (WFC.N) U.S. brokerage business bolstered its adviser force in the final quarter of 2012, helping to expand the company’s client asset base at a time when rival firms have seen more advisers walk out the door. The company said on Friday its Wells Fargo Advisors unit grew by 247 advisers in the three months ended Dec 31, bringing its total U.S. force to 15,414 advisers - a net gain of 151 advisers from the year prior. Client assets managed by the St. Louis-based brokerage rose to $1.2 trillion, an 8 percent increase from the same period last year. Wells Fargo Advisors is the third-largest U.S. brokerage by adviser headcount and client assets managed, following Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) Merrill Lynch. “They’ve been doing really well and will probably have a good recruiting year (in 2013),” said California-based financial services recruiter Ron Edde, noting that Wells’ has largely benefited from growth in its independent brokerage unit. Wells is the only one of the top four U.S. brokerages - so-called “wirehouse” firms because of their affiliation with big banks - to have an option for independent advisers, in addition to traditional employee advisers. “It carries some appeal that other firms can’t offer,” Edde said. Both Morgan Stanley and Merrill, which are due to release their fourth-quarter numbers later this month, reported a decline in their respective adviser forces during the last reporting cycle. Merrill’s adviser force shrank by 75 advisers in the third quarter, while Morgan Stanley’s (MS.N) adviser force declined by 105 advisers. Much of Wells’ success in recruiting for the year came from increased interest in the firm’s independent brokerage division, Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, or “FiNet,” which caters to independent advisers who also function as business owners. “It molds a solid bank with a really entrepreneurial brokerage platform,” said New Jersey-based securities lawyer Tom Lewis of Stark & Stark. “It’s the best of both worlds for a lot of advisers.” In the fourth quarter alone, Wells added at least 12 teams that each managed more than $100 million in client assets, based on moves tracked by Reuters. Five of those teams joined the company’s independent brokerage unit. Among those recruits was California-based adviser Michael Kazmer, who managed $620 million in client assets with his team and joined Wells in early November from Merrill. Kazmer, who decided to go independent after three decades in the industry, said he chose to do so with Wells because of the reputation and market capitalization of the company. “It gave us a sense of comfort,” Kazmer said in an interview. FiNet managing director Ron Sallet told Reuters in early January that 2012 was the second-best recruiting year for the independent division in more than a decade. “We recognize that one of our advantages is the strength of the Wells Fargo name,” he said. “We think our firm is continuing to position itself in the market as the firm of choice.” Wells also said in its quarterly report that the portion of retail brokerage assets held in managed accounts rose 20 percent year over year in the fourth quarter, boosted by strong net flows and a run-up in market performance. Managed accounts are those for which a client is charged a flat management fee based on the assets in the account. Wells, the first big bank to report fourth-quarter results, said on Friday its quarterly profit rose 24 percent to a record high of $5.1 billion.

Dow component Boeing also weighed on the market after a cracked cockpit window and an oil leak on separate flights in Japan added to problems with some of its Dreamliner jets earlier in the week, compounding safety concerns about the new aircraft. The U.S. Department of Transportation said the jet would be subject to a review of its critical systems by regulators. Boeing was the biggest loser on the Dow, falling 3.1 percent to $74.73. Wells Fargo was the first major bank to report results and said its fourth-quarter net interest margin - a key measure of how much money banks make from loans - fell, even as profit jumped 24 percent. The bank also made fewer mortgage loans than in the third quarter. “It (Wells Fargo results) is weighing on the sector. We are keeping our fingers crossed that this won’t be a sector thing and more confined to Wells Fargo, but it’s definitely playing a factor today,” said Larry Peruzzi, senior equity trader at Cabrera Capital Markets LLC in Boston.

The Nasdaq Composite Index dipped 0.64 points, or 0.02 percent, to 3,121.13. Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co  and Citigroup Inc are due to report results next week. Overall earnings were expected to grow by 1.9 percent in this earnings season, according to Thomson Reuters data. But analysts say that with the bar so low, there’s room for companies to beat expectations, even if their results are not stellar. “People are going to be looking for a slowdown in Europe to hit revenues for companies in the U.S. that are exposed to that.   I don’t think the market is going to react to that, that’s already built in,” said Troy Logan, managing director and senior economist at Warren Financial Service, in Exton, Pennsylvania. Best Buy shares rallied after its results showed a small turnaround in its U.S. stores, though same-store sales were flat during the key holiday season. Shares jumped 13.4 percent to $13.85, making it the best performer on the S&P; 500. Basic materials shares were pressured after China’s annual consumer inflation rate picked up to a seven-month high, narrowing the scope for the central bank to boost the economy by easing monetary policy. The S&P; basic materials sector  slipped 0.4 percent. Dendreon Corp shares surged 17.4 percent to $5.99 after Sanford C.

637,WFC,Wells Fargo loses $1.4 million raiding case against Stifel Nicolaus,"(Reuters) - A unit of Wells Fargo & Co lost a $1.4 million securities arbitration case against Stifel Nicolaus & Co, whom it alleged improperly recruited a group of brokers from a New York City area branch office, according to a ruling. The decision by a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority panel, dated Sunday, ends a long dispute that began in 2009 and played out during 24 days of hearings, according to the ruling. Wells Fargo Advisors also named a total of 18 Stifel advisers as respondents in the case, which started as three separate cases that were later combined. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment. At issue in the case is a practice known as “raiding,” according to the ruling. A raiding claim is typically made when a firm loses 30 percent to 40 percent of the production - the amount brokers generate in revenue during a year - from a branch office in one swoop or over a short period of time, say lawyers. Wells Fargo also alleged, among other things, that the brokers and Stifel interfered with its business relationships and breached their employment contracts. But experts say there can be a fine line between smart recruiting and raiding. The saga pre-dates Wells Fargo’s acquisition of Wachovia Corp in 2008. Wachovia, which purchased AG Edwards Inc in 2008, agreed to move its brokerage business to St. Louis from Richmond, Virginia, as part of the deal. Later, in the depths of the financial crisis, Wells Fargo purchased Wachovia. Stifel, a unit of Stifel Financial Corp, is also based in St. Louis. Dozens of AG Edwards brokers, managers and support staff defected to the cross-town rival after Wachovia announced it was buying AG Edwards, a firm with more than 7,000 brokers that was founded in 1887. Wachovia responded with a string of arbitration claims against Stifel and individual brokers and managers. Most have been resolved to date in Stifel’s favor. FINRA panels, in two cases, also awarded legal fees to Stifel. “This case continues to underscore that people are free to work at the place of their choosing,” said Ron Kruszewski, chairman and chief executive of Stifel Financial. The FINRA panel, as is typical, did not include the reasons for its decision in the ruling.

Joe Saffire joins the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets after 20 years with HSBC, where he most recently was chief operating officer and head of international banking in Germany. He will be based in London and report to Sanjiv Sanghvi, head of Wells Fargo’s global banking group. Wells said Saffire will focus on increasing business with U.S.-based companies in Europe and European companies that operate in the United States. The San Francisco-based bank has said it plans to expand lending, treasury management and other services in 20 countries outside the United States in the coming years. In November, the bank said it was adding wholesale business lines in Canada after receiving a license that allows it to make loans to and take deposits from corporate customers but not consumers.",1152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-europe/wells-fargo-hires-hsbc-veteran-in-european-push-idUSL2N0AK7KT20130115
641,WFC,Wells Fargo forms aircraft leasing venture,"Jan 17 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co on Thursday said it is forming a new business that will lease airplanes as it looks for fresh ways to boost returns. The No. 4 U.S. bank by assets is teaming with Irish aircraft leasing company Avolon to form a Dublin-based joint venture called Avolon Capital Partners that will buy new planes from airlines and lease them back. The initial target for the aircraft portfolio is $500 million, Avolon said. Wells will be the majority shareholder and provide banking and debt financing for the business. In a statement, Wells’ head of asset-backed finance, Julie  Caperton, said the bank was pleased to deepen its relationship with Avolon, a long-standing client. Since its start in 2010, Avolon said it has raised $3.7 billion of debt capital from a number of financial institutions, including Wells. A year ago, Wells Fargo lost an auction to buy Royal Bank of Scotland’s aircraft leasing business to Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Sumitomo Corp. The San Francisco-based bank has been active in buying portfolios from European banks as it strives for more interest income. The formation of the venture is subject to regulatory approvals.",1172013,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-leasing/wells-fargo-forms-aircraft-leasing-venture-idUSL1E9CHLH420130117

643,WFC,Mortgage cases to test US use of once-obscure fraud statute,"Jan 17 (Reuters) - Banks are testing U.S. authorities’ use of a once-obscure statute to bring more cases tied to the financial crisis, arguing the government is twisting the law beyond what it can do. In a motion to dismiss a federal case alleging mortgage misconduct, Wells Fargo said late Wednesday the government was essentially trying to argue that the bank defrauded itself under one of the laws at issue, FIRREA. Bank of America is also fighting a recent lawsuit from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan alleging some $1 billion in losses to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , partly by arguing those institutions also don’t qualify as affected firms under FIRREA. Courts are expected to weigh in later this year on the issue in both cases. If they side with the banks, it could limit a key Justice Department tool promoted as a way to bring big civil cases against misconduct that fueled the 2007-2009 crisis. FIRREA, or the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act, is a federal civil fraud statute passed in the wake of the 1980s savings-and-loan scandals. It covers fraud affecting federally in s ured financial institutions. While it has only appeared in a few dozen cases, its low burden of proof, broad investigative powers and long statute of limitations encouraged the Justice Department to dust it off for potential cases, especially after criminal inquiries failed to yield major prosecutions. The DOJ, led by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s office, has used the statute in big bank cases in the past year, including against Citigroup, Bank of New York Mellon, and in the $25 billion settlement with five top banks that resolved allegations of mortgage servicing abuses. While those cases resulted in settlements, rulings in the cases against Bank of America and Wells Fargo could lay out clear markers of just what is covered by the law. The U.S. in October sued Bank of America, accusing it of violating FIRREA and other laws when it caused taxpayers more than $1 billion in losses by selling thousands of toxic mortgage loans to the government-sponsored Fannie and Freddie. When Bank of America filed a motion to dismiss the case in late December, it said the government was turning the law on its head. The alleged fraud was directed at Fannie and Freddie, which are not themselves federally insured financial institutions, the bank said. The DOJ’s allegations instead hung on other federally insured institutions that were preferred Fannie and Freddie stockholders who suffered losses as a result of the loans. “This interpretation ... is limitless and absurd,” the bank said. “This is a wildly expansive reading...(the law) was not intended to increase civil penalties for all fraud that, through intermediaries, might remotely touch a financial institution...” it said. Bank of America also said the Justice Department did not describe a scheme to defraud, as the statute requires, but only that Countrywide violated contracts with Fannie and Freddie. Oral arguments on the motion are scheduled for April 18. In seeking to defeat an October lawsuit that alleges more than 10 years of misconduct related to government-insured loans, Wells Fargo too attacked the Justice Department’s theories under FIRREA. The original complaint did not specifically identify a federally insured financial institution, the bank said in its Wednesday filing. “The United States has now tried to cure this defect by alleging that Wells Fargo is the ‘federally insured financial institution’ that was ‘affect ‘ by Wells Fargo’s own alleged violations...No court has accepted this ‘affect yourself’ theory of liability, and it is wrong.” The DOJ built its case against Wells Fargo in part through information gleaned from four FIRREA subpoenas, according to court documents. The law allows civil prosecutors to obtain information prior to filing a lawsuit, which most civil laws don’t allow. The bank also argued it was already absolved of much of the liability through an earlier $25 billion, multi-bank deal. The government has until Feb. 13 to respond to Wells Fargo’s motion.",1172013,http://www.reuters.com/article/doj-firrea/mortgage-cases-to-test-us-use-of-once-obscure-fraud-statute-idUSL1E9C2BYE20130117
644,WFC,Wells Fargo increases quarterly dividend by 14 percent,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) on Tuesday raised its quarterly stock dividend by 14 percent as it awaits U.S. Federal Reserve permission to potentially return even more capital to shareholders in the coming year. The No. 4 U.S. bank by assets said in a statement that the increase of 3 cents to 25 cents per share was part of a capital plan that received approval from the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2012. Wells in March raised its quarterly dividend by 10 cents to 22 cents per share after the Fed completed annual stress tests on large U.S. banks. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, banks now need the Fed’s assent before increasing dividends and buying back more shares. The San Francisco-based bank said it asked the Fed permission to return more capital to shareholders as part of its 2013 capital plan, which is under review. The Fed is expected to complete its work in March, after which approved banks can raise dividends or buy back more shares for the period that runs from the second quarter of 2013 through the first quarter of 2014. “We remain committed to returning more capital to our shareholders,” Wells Chief Executive John Stumpf said in a statement. The dividend of 25 cents per share is payable March 1 to stockholders of record on February 1. Wells has about 5.3 billion shares outstanding. The increased dividend is worth an extra $12.7 million to Wells’ largest shareholder, Warren Buffett’s conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), based on Thomson Reuters data. Wells has emerged as one of the healthier U.S. banks since the financial crisis. It has been able to raise payouts for shareholders in recent years, while rivals such as Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N) are still paying a penny per share each quarter as they work to build capital and reliable profits. U.S. regional bank BB&T; Corp (BBT.N) on Tuesday increased its quarterly dividend by 3 cents to 23 cents per share in a move that it also said was part of its 2012 capital plan.

650,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Ameriprise lands Wells Fargo adviser in Wisconsin,"Feb 4 (Reuters) - Ameriprise Financial Inc has bolstered its adviser force in Wisconsin with a veteran adviser and his team from Wells Fargo & Co’s U.S. brokerage. Ted Fox joined Ameriprise’s independent broker division in January from Wells Fargo Advisors, where he managed $175 million in client assets and generated annual revenue of $1.2 million. “I felt that the time was right for me to be my own boss,” Fox said in an interview about his decision to become an independent adviser. “I’m able to make my own decisions now and focus on what’s best for my clients ... versus having to wonder if I need to solicit them for a mortgage, credit card or checking account,” he said. “I don’t have to worry about doing that here.” Fox, who has worked in the advising industry for roughly two decades, remains based in Wausau, Wisconsin, where he was based with Wells as a managing director. Wells Fargo Advisors, owned by Wells Fargo & Co, is the third-largest U.S. brokerage, following Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and Bank of America Corp’s Merrill Lynch. Wells declined to comment on Fox’s departure. Fox spent the bulk of his career with A.G. Edwards & Co. A.G. Edwards was acquired in 2007 by Wachovia, which one year later was bought by Wells. Fox said he sought a similar culture and environment that he had experienced at A.G. Edwards, before its acquisition. “I wanted to find a firm that I could move to that had a strong backing and brand and would be a solid franchise for me to move my whole team to,” Fox said. Fox, the senior adviser on his team, moved with fellow advisers Joel Pergolski and Karissa Smith, also formerly with Wells. Ameriprise’s independent division has about 7,500 advisers who run their own practices and function as business owners. The company also has a traditional employee broker-dealer division, which has an additional roughly 2,300 advisers across the country. Minneapolis-based Ameriprise had $352.8 billion in total client assets under management as of the end of December - a 14 percent increase from the prior year. The company last week said its operating earnings rose 31 percent from last year, driven by strong results from its advice and wealth management business. Ameriprise, along with other smaller regional brokerages, has had success in recruiting veteran advisers from larger bank-owned brokerages.

654,WFC,UPDATE 1-U.S. judge dismisses ATM fee collusion lawsuits,"* Visa, MasterCard, JPMorgan, BofA, Wells Fargo win * No conspiracy to fix prices found By Jonathan Stempel Feb 13 (Reuters) - A federal judge has dismissed antitrust lawsuits accusing Visa Inc, MasterCard Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co of conspiring to fix automated teller machine fees. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, D.C., said that, while the three lawsuits “bristle with indignation,” the plaintiffs failed to show they were injured, or that there was a conspiracy to charge excessive or artificially high fees. “Notwithstanding plaintiffs’ adamant insistence that consumers are being overcharged, the court simply could not find facts to support that contention,” Jackson wrote. The plaintiffs included several individual consumers, 13 owners and operators of independent non-bank ATMs that compete with bank ATMs, as well as the National ATM Council, a trade group for those owners and operators. Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bank of America spokeswoman Shirley Norton and MasterCard spokesman James Issokson said their companies are pleased with the decision. Visa spokesman Will Valentine, JPMorgan spokesman Thomas Kelly and Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez declined to comment. Visa and MasterCard are the world’s largest payment networks. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are the largest, second-largest and fourth-largest U.S. banks by assets. In September, financial research firm Bankrate.com said the cost of using out-of-network ATMs rose 4 percent in the prior year to a record $2.50. It also said people who use such ATMs paid their own banks an average $1.57 fee, up 11 percent. The lawsuits filed in October 2011 accused Visa and MasterCard of setting rules that barred ATM operators from offering lower prices on independent PIN debit card networks that were not affiliated with either company. These networks comprise 200,000 ATMs nationwide, many of which are found in such places as convenience stores and gas stations, court papers show. The plaintiffs said the alleged illegal agreements required operators of ATMs that accepted Visa- or MasterCard-branded cards to charge consumers no more for using those cards than they charged consumers who transact on other ATM networks. Visa and MasterCard said this helped consumers by setting a ceiling on ATM access fees. The plaintiffs countered it established a floor beneath which fees for transactions processed on other networks could not be discounted. In finding no conspiracy among Visa, MasterCard and the banks to restrain trade, Jackson said that “at most, plaintiffs allege that ATM operators - both banks and independent operators - make independent business decisions whether to participate in the Visa and MasterCard networks.” The cases, all in the U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, are National ATM Council Inc et al v. Visa Inc et al, No. 11-01803; Mackmin et al v. Visa Inc et al, No. 11-01831; and Stoumbos v.

The reverse break-up fee - the amount that Buffett and 3G will have to pay Heinz if they can’t close the deal - totals $1.4 billion, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and 3G would each pay 50 percent of the fee, the documents said. The fee is roughly 5 percent of the deal value, which includes $5 billion in debt. That’s largely in line with historical averages. J.P.

659,WFC,DEALTALK-Wells Fargo ramps up private equity despite Volcker Rule,"* PE business produced $715 million in gains in 4th quarter * Norwest investments may be considered ‘merchant banking’ * Bank of America and Citi pull back from private equity By Rick Rothacker Feb 21 (Reuters) - When former Wells Fargo & Co  Chief Executive Dick Kovacevich joined Norwest Bank in 1986, he had reservations about its private equity investments as he did not think it was the kind of business a bank needed to be in. He got over it. “I was skeptical, met with the people and became convinced that they absolutely knew what they were doing and that this was a business we could manage and do well,” said Kovacevich, who became CEO of Wells Fargo when it merged with Norwest in 1998, and retired as chairman of the fourth-largest U.S. bank in 2009. U.S. lawmakers shared Kovacevich’s skepticism about private equity when they crafted the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill in 2010. In a section of the law known as the “Volcker Rule,” they blocked banks from making big bets with their capital, including sizable investments in private equity funds, fearing taxpayers would be left on the hook when wagers soured. The fine print of the Volcker Rule - named for former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker - is expected to be finalized as soon as this year. Major banks such as Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc are already pulling back from private equity investments ahead of the rules. But Wells Fargo is taking a different path. The bank invests in buyouts and venture capital deals largely on its own, with capital only from Wells Fargo itself and some employees. By avoiding equity from outside investors, the bank is considered to be engaging in “merchant banking,” an activity that is likely to be exempt under the Volcker Rule, lawyers and people familiar with the matter said. Wells Fargo’s private equity investments show how even button-down, staid banks are looking for loopholes in financial regulations as they seek to boost their profits. Their decisions may run counter to rulemakers’ efforts to make the financial system safer. The merchant banking that Wells Fargo is embracing is riskier than investing in private equity funds with outside investors, where a bank shares any losses with others. Some critics warn that the Volcker Rule is banning the safer of the two activities, and allowing the one that could lead to bigger losses for a bank. Some argue that banks should be blocked from any form of private equity investing. Sheila Bair, the former chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, which guarantees the deposits of banks like Wells Fargo, said private equity and merchant banking are too far removed from regular banking. “Is that really what you want institutions that have safety net support doing? Is that an appropriate use for a government backstop?” she told Reuters. Wells Fargo declined to comment for this story, noting that the regulations are not yet final. But the bank has said publicly it expects to continue to back its main private equity-type funds - Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Venture Partners - that buy stakes in or take over smaller companies. “We believe that we will continue to be able to invest, and we continue to invest today, in Norwest Venture Partners and Norwest Equity Partners, which we believe will be allowed under the Volcker Rule,” Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said on a recent conference call. The Norwest funds account for most of the bank’s $3.7 billion of private equity assets, which represent a little more than 3 percent of the bank’s Tier 1 regulatory capital. In the fourth quarter, private equity was a key business for the bank, earning about $715 million before taxes and boosting the bottom line by about 10 percent. The above-average gain came from selling a seed treatment company to chemical maker BASF  for $1.02 billion. Other banks are looking at ways around the Volcker Rule, too. Goldman Sachs Group Inc, for example, had about $16.8 billion of private equity investments as of Sept. 30, representing about a quarter of its regulatory capital. Some assets are merchant banking investments, meaning Goldman may use the same Volcker loophole as Wells Fargo. A Goldman spokesman declined to comment. Wells Fargo’s private equity business is small relative to the bank’s overall assets, but it grew 8 percent in 2012 from the prior year, and is more than double its level in 2005. Norwest is still making investments using funds it received from Wells in 2008, and the bank contributed another $250 million to a Norwest pool in 2011, a person familiar with the funds said. The lure of private equity to companies like Wells Fargo is not only profitable investment returns, but also new business for other parts of the bank. The funds work with small- and mid-sized companies that often also need loans, treasury management, and other financing and services, former CEO Kovacevich said. In January 2012, for example, Norwest Equity Partners bought rifle maker Savage Sports, teaming up with the company’s management. Wells Fargo also arranged senior debt financing for the purchase, which according to Crain’s Detroit Business cost the buyers more than $100 million. Business can go the other way, too - companies that borrow from Wells Fargo can get equity from Norwest Equity Partners. “It’s good for the bank, and it’s good for the economy,” Kovacevich said. “If you do something well for 50 years why would you not continue doing it?” The funds were founded in 1961. The business can be good for the bank’s shareholders - Wells Fargo’s private equity unit has produced gains every quarter for the last three years - but it can also be a negative. In 2008 and 2009, Wells Fargo took $1.27 billion in losses from its private equity holdings over the course of three quarters as the financial crisis hit hard and it absorbed assets from Wachovia. Some Norwest investments have also turned out badly more recently. Norwest turned over Deep Rock Water Co to the bottled water company’s creditors before it was sold in 2011, the person familiar with the funds said. The Savage Sports deal may also end up performing poorly, the person added, after the Newtown, Connecticut, school shootings in December hit gun makers’ shares. Savage and Deep Rock Water did not return calls seeking comment. Losses in individual companies are not unusual for a private equity business, but during tough times, the value of the whole portfolio can drop. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co , and others took big charges on their private equity portfolios in the third quarter of 2011 as stock markets sank. The Volcker Rule says that banks cannot hold more than 3 percent of their Tier 1 capital in private equity funds, but the details of the regulations are still being finalized and banks could have as many as 10 years to comply with the regulations. Inside the Norwest funds, some employees wonder whether regulators will be sanguine about the business as it grows, the source familiar with the funds said. Tim Keehan, senior counsel with the American Bankers Association, said it appears merchant banking won’t be covered by the rule, but it’s still unclear until the rules are final. “The reason it still is a concern is we don’t have any sense of boundaries on these definitions,” Keehan said. “That’s why I think you’re seeing some banks go one way, and some banks go the other way.” Kovacevich said Wells Fargo’s private equity business has had a solid track record, but the bank should be careful. “I would never want it to be big,” he said. “I don’t consider it something you must be in if you are a commercial bank or should be in if you don’t know what you’re doing. It’s got risk to it.”",2212013,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-privateequity/dealtalk-wells-fargo-ramps-up-private-equity-despite-volcker-rule-idUSL1N0BC8J920130221

661,WFC,Regulators examine if big banks evade payday loan laws: NYT,"(Reuters) - Federal and state regulators are examining whether some of the largest U.S. banks are helping Internet-based lenders evade state laws that cap interest rates on payday loans, The New York Times said on Sunday. Citing several people with direct knowledge of the matter, the newspaper said the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington, D.C. are examining the role of banks in online payday loans. It also said Benjamin Lawsky, who heads New York State’s Department of Financial Services, is investigating how banks enable online lenders to make high-rate loans to residents of New York, where interest rates are capped at 25 percent. Payday loans, typically a few hundred dollars in size, enable cash-strapped borrowers to obtain quick funds to tide them over until their next paychecks. But the loans can carry effective annual interest rates that reach well into three digits. Some consumer advocates consider the loans a means to take advantage of financially desperate Americans, who nonetheless shell out $7.4 billion a year for them according to a February 20 study by the Pew Charitable Trusts. The newspaper did not identify the banks being examined. But it said that while large banks such as Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co do not make the actual loans, they do let lenders that do to withdraw payments from customers’ accounts, even if customers have already begged them to stop. According to the newspaper, 15 U.S. states ban payday loans, but lenders are setting up online operations in places such as Belize, Malta and the West Indies to more easily evade the caps. Representatives of JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo, the four largest U.S. banks, had no immediate comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The FDIC, the CFPB and Lawsky’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The newspaper said a Bank of America spokeswoman said that bank has always honored requests to stop automatic withdrawals, a JPMorgan spokeswoman said that bank is working to resolve open cases, and Wells Fargo declined to comment. According to the Pew study, Americans on average pay $520 in finance charges for payday loans that average just $375. Many of these borrowers find the process a never-ending cycle that leaves them in the same financial binds where they started, according to the study. Fifty-eight percent of borrowers reported persistent problems paying their bills, and 41 percent found they needed help to repay the loans - such as by borrowing from friends or family, selling personal possessions, or taking out other loans. Moreover, 27 percent of payday loan borrowers said the loans caused them to overdraw their checking accounts - enabling banks to charge fees for those overdrafts. “It seems like you never catch up, and it, it’s just check-to-check, and something breaks down, and the house needs work, kids have school, just never catch up,” a storefront borrower in Chicago was quoted in the report as saying. The borrower was then asked how long this had gone on. The response: “Twenty years.” ",2242013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-paydayloans/regulators-examine-if-big-banks-evade-payday-loan-laws-nyt-idUSBRE91N0DV20130224
662,WFC,Wells role in Heinz deal highlights risk: Moody's,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo’s role in a blockbuster investment banking deal is raising concerns at a major ratings agency. Wells’ agreement to provide financing for H.J. Heinz Co’s HNZ.N $23 billion buyout highlights how the No. 4 U.S. bank is expanding beyond retail banking into riskier capital markets businesses, Allen Tischler, an analyst at Moody’s Investor Services, wrote in a report on Monday. Moody’s stopped short of saying it might cut Wells Fargo’s ratings, or change the outlook for its ratings, but did note that the bank appears to be dialing up risk. Wells Fargo’s low exposure to the capital markets business allowed it to avoid a wave of downgrades that hit many of the biggest banks globally last year. In a statement, Wells Fargo said it disagreed with Moody’s assertion that “participation in capital markets activities necessarily leads to a higher risk profile.” The bank has strong risk management and underwriting practices and followed them in the deal, the statement added. Wells served as a financial adviser to Heinz and has joined JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) in providing $14.1 billion in financing, according to the report. Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and private equity firm 3G Capital are buying the ketchup maker in a $23 billion deal announced February 14. While JPMorgan has long been entrenched in the capital markets business, Wells Fargo has largely focused on providing traditional banking services like loans to large corporations, the report said. Wells, however, gained more capital markets capabilities when it bought Wachovia Corp in 2008. Wells Fargo’s “primary capital market capabilities... are lucrative but can lead to riskier activities,” Tischler wrote. When a bank serves as an adviser to a company on a deal, the client often expects it to provide financing, Tischler wrote. This can be a problem if a bank offers more financing than it should just to win lucrative investment banking fees. The Heinz deal could also encourage Wells to expand its capacity to trade debt and loans, Tischler wrote. Wells Fargo has a longstanding relationship with one of the key players in the Heinz deal: Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett. Berkshire is Wells Fargo’s largest shareholder.

668,WFC,FINRA bars ex-Wells Fargo adviser for alleged check-writing scam,"March 6 (Reuters) - A former broker for Wells Fargo Advisors LLC has been barred from the securities industry after allegedly writing at least $650,000 in checks from a client’s account without permission, including to his girlfriend, according to a regulatory document. Adorean Boleancu, a former San Francisco-based adviser at Wells Fargo Private Bank, a unit of Wells Fargo & Co, agreed to a permanent bar from the industry in a settlement with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street’s self-watchdog, according to a document dated Tuesday. Boleancu must also repay the client, an elderly widow, $650,000, according to the settlement. He neither admitted nor denied FINRA’s findings. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment. Boleancu made a “common sense decision” to settle FINRA’s  action without incurring monetary penalties, said his San Francisco-based lawyer, Ethan Balogh. Boleancu repaid the client, Donna Treadwell, in February, Balogh said. Boleancu also faces a separate arbitration filed by Treadwell. The FINRA action stems from alleged misconduct that occurred after Boleancu joined Wells Fargo in 2008 and until 2010. He allegedly wrote checks in Treadwell’s name from two home equity lines of credit he advised her to open, FINRA said. The recipients included his girlfriend, said FINRA. He used Treadwell’s checking account to pay the equity line interest. Treadwell filed a lawsuit last year in a California state court against Boleancu, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley,  where Boleancu worked from 2004 to 2008, according to filings. Boleancu was Treadwell’s adviser at Morgan Stanley and she moved her assets to Wells Fargo when he switched firms. Treadwell, while at Morgan Stanley, also invested $2 million in variable annuities as Boleancu advised, according to the lawsuit. Variable annuities are tax-deferred investments tied to an insurance contract. They can be risky, however, because the returns, unlike fixed annuities, fluctuate based on the performance of underlying securities. She paid a $70,000 fee to exit the annuities last year. By then, their value sank by $1 million. The parties later agreed to resolve the court case in arbitration. Morgan Stanley plans to defend itself in the arbitration, a spokeswoman said. Boleancu’s conduct in the FINRA action, she said, happened after he left Morgan Stanley. Wells Fargo terminated Boleancu in 2011 for not adequately participating in a company review about a loan from a client, the firm disclosed in a filing.",3062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/finra-wellsfargo/finra-bars-ex-wells-fargo-adviser-for-alleged-check-writing-scam-idUSL1N0BYFTM20130306

670,WFC,Wells Fargo CEO's pay rose 8 percent to $19.3 million - filing,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) Chief Executive John Stumpf’s pay increased 8 percent in 2012, making him one of the industry’s best-paid leaders, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. Stumpf received $19.3 million in compensation, comprising a $4 million bonus, $12.5 million in performance-based stock grants and $2.8 million in salary , after the No. 4 U.S. bank by assets hauled in record profits. For 2011, Stumpf received total compensation of $17.9 million. While many of its rivals suffered missteps, San Francisco-based Wells emerged from the 2007-2009 financial crisis as the nation’s biggest mortgage lender and a coast-to-coast retail bank after buying Wachovia Corp. Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s (BRKa.N) Warren Buffett is the bank’s biggest investor, owning 8.8 percent of its shares, according to the filing. Wells posted $18.9 billion in earnings in 2012, up 19 percent from the previous year, but investors are worried the bank will have trouble repeating the performance amid a decline in mortgage refinancings. The bank’s shares rose 24 percent in 2012, below the 30 percent increase in the KBW Bank Index. Stumpf is landing at the top of the banker pay scale as some of his peers are getting their paychecks docked.

680,WFC,Wells Fargo trimming outside legal expenses -general counsel,"CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 21 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co  is looking to spend less money on outside lawyers as part of a companywide cost-cutting initiative, the bank’s general counsel said on Thursday. The No. 4 U.S. bank by assets began reviewing these expenses about nine months ago and plans to start implementing changes in the next quarter or so, Jim Strother said in remarks at a University of North Carolina law school conference in Charlotte, North Carolina. “We do expect to have a meaningful reduction in outside counsel expense,” Strother told Reuters after the speech, declining to provide details. Wells’ focus on legal expenses is the latest example of banks tightening their belts at a time when low interest rates and new regulations are making it more difficult to increase revenue. The bank will likely increase internal staff to handle a litigation workload that has mushroomed in the wake of the financial crisis, Strother said. The legal department currently has more than 800 people, including 390 lawyers, he said. The bank doesn’t disclose fees it pays outside firms, but its overall litigation expenses, like at other banks, have skyrocketed in the wake of the financial crisis. The bank’s “operating losses,” which include the costs of mortgage-related settlements, increased 77 percent to $2.2 billion in 2012, from 2011, according to its annual report. “We’re through an awful lot of it, but we still have quite a bit left to work through,” said Strother, who has been general counsel since 2003. In the latest legal trouble spot for banks, the U.S. Justice Department is examining the role financial institutions play in fraud schemes perpetrated by bank customers offering deceptive products, a department official said on Wednesday. Attorneys and investigators in the DOJ’s Civil Division are examining banks’ possible role in assisting scammers who offer questionable payday loans, false offers of debt relief, fraudulent health care discount cards, and phony government grants, according to Michael Bresnick, who heads the department’s Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force. [ID: nL1N0CCCGI] Wells Fargo is reviewing its practices but has nothing to announce, Strother told Reuters. On Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase & Co said it was changing some of its practices to help protect consumers from inappropriate payments sought by payday lenders and other billers.",3212013,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-legal-fees/wells-fargo-trimming-outside-legal-expenses-general-counsel-idUSL1N0CDDU020130321

682,WFC,Wells Fargo says cyber attack disrupting website,"March 26 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co on Tuesday said its online banking website was experiencing an unusually high volume of traffic that it believes stems from a denial-of-service cyber attack. “The vast majority of customers are not impacted and customer information remains safe,” said Bridget Braxton, a spokeswoman for the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets. Customers who have trouble should try logging in again because the disruption is usually intermittent, she said. Since September, a hacker activist group called the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters has said it was launching denial of service attacks against major U.S. banks. These attacks can disrupt service by deluging websites with high traffic. In a posting Tuesday on pastebin.com, the group listed Wells Fargo as one of the banks “being chosen as a target.” In December, Wells customers had trouble accessing the website for four days. In its annual report filing last month, Wells said it had not experienced any “material losses” related to cyber attacks but that enhancing its protections remained a priority.",3262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-website-attacks/wells-fargo-says-cyber-attack-disrupting-website-idUSL2N0CI1RO20130326

685,WFC,Wells Fargo must face lawsuit tied to Medical Capital fraud,"(Reuters) - A federal judge has rejected a bid by Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) to dismiss a lawsuit by investors who said it failed in its role as trustee for debt issued by a financing company that collapsed in 2009 in an estimated billion-dollar fraud. A 50-page decision by U.S. District Judge David Carter in Santa Ana, California on Tuesday clears the way for a possible trial against the fourth-largest U.S. bank over its dealings with Medical Capital Holdings Inc. The judge also ruled outright for the investors on some claims in the class action, and dismissed other claims against San Francisco-based Wells Fargo. Investors contended that Wells Fargo was supposed to disburse money so that Medical Capital could offer financing to medical care providers by purchasing their outstanding receivables. Instead, they said the bank failed to stop Medical Capital from diverting their money to such things as non-medical projects and excessive administrative fees. “It is a tremendous result for us to be able to go forward on claims that could total hundreds of millions of dollars,” Mark Molumphy, a lawyer at Cotchett Pitre & McCarthy who represents the investors, said in a Wednesday phone interview. A Wells Fargo spokesman did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment. Carter ruled six weeks after Bank of New York Mellon Co (BK.N) said it would pay $114 million to settle claims over its own role as a trustee for Medical Capital debt. According to court papers, Medical Capital had raised $1.7 billion from more than 20,000 investors from 2003 to July 2009, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the Tustin, California-based company and two executives for fraud. Medical Capital was soon shut down. A receiver later found that investors lost between $839 million and $1.08 billion, and that the company had used a ""Ponzi-like scheme"" to extract excess fees. (here) In the Wells Fargo case, investors had bought notes issued by three Medical Capital special purpose companies for which Wells Fargo was trustee. These investors accused Wells Fargo of 63 separate breaches, including failing to declare events of default and disbursing funds to Medical Capital based on inaccurate, incomplete or missing documentation. Wells Fargo has argued that it neither acted in bad faith, nor acted negligently in performing its contractual obligations. “Plaintiffs have deposed every Wells Fargo employee they could think of,” the bank’s lawyers said in a February 11 filing. “There is no evidence that any of them knew of wrongdoing by Medical Capital, or even suspected wrongdoing” until 2009, after payment defaults and the SEC probe had begun, the lawyers added. In his decision, Carter nonetheless said the noteholders “have shown a genuine dispute as to whether any breach by Wells Fargo was a cause-in-fact of their losses.” He also said they could pursue a claim that Wells Fargo distributed some funds in bad faith.

690,WFC,"Wells Fargo profit beats, but mortgage business slows","(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) reported a higher-than-expected 23 percent rise in first-quarter profit on Friday, but its mortgage business showed further signs of slowing and net interest margins continued to shrink. The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets has emerged from the financial crisis as the leading U.S. home lender as other banks have pulled back from a business that burned them during the housing bust. But the bank has now seen a decline in home loans for two consecutive quarters as fewer borrowers refinance at low interest rates. “It’s going from great to good,” said Sandler O’Neill analyst Scott Siefers. “This is a business that is simply tailing off, and it’s going to be very challenging to sustain.” Wells made $109 billion in home loans during the quarter, down from $129 billion in the same quarter a year ago and less than the $125 billion in loans extended in the fourth quarter. Fees from mortgages dropped 2 percent to $2.8 billion from a year earlier and were down 9 percent from the fourth quarter. The bank’s pipeline of applications for home loans that have not yet closed was $74 billion at the end of the first quarter, down from $81 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. “Our guess is that mortgage origination levels and revenues will continue to come down,” Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said in an interview. He said the bank was seeing an increase in loans taken out by customers buying homes, which will help offset a decline in refinancings. Refinancings accounted for 65 percent of mortgage applications in the first quarter, down from 76 percent a year ago. Wells’ mortgage market share dipped to 27.7 percent at the end of the fourth quarter from 33.9 percent in the first quarter of last year, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication. The bank’s share could fall to the low- to mid-20 percent range, Sloan said, because the bank is such a dominant player in mortgage refinancings. The bank kicked off the bank earnings season on the same day as JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N). The largest U.S. bank said its first-quarter earnings rose 33 percent to $6.53 billion, but most of its major businesses turned in tepid performances. Unlike Wells Fargo, though, JPMorgan’s mortgage originations rose, by 37 percent from a year earlier and 3 percent from the fourth quarter. With the debate in Washington heating up over too-big-to fail banks, Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf took time during the bank’s earnings conference call to lash out against efforts to further regulate the largest financial institutions. “We do not need additional legislation aimed at big banks,” Stumpf said. “Important and significant regulatory changes have been made since the financial crisis and we need to give existing regulations a chance to work.” The United States needs banks of all sizes, and large banks have “unique resources and capabilities” to help fuel economic growth, he said. Stumpf was part of a group of bank CEOs who met with President Barack Obama on Thursday at the White House. The need to revive the U.S. economy and reform immigration and fiscal policy was on the agenda set by the White House. <ID: nL2N0CY1MY> Wells Fargo said net income applicable to common shareholders rose in the quarter to $4.93 billion, or 92 cents per share, compared with $4.02 billion, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 88 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding preferred dividend payments, the bank’s net income was $5.2 billion, up 22 percent. The results marked the 13th consecutive quarter in which the bank’s earnings per share have risen from the preceding quarter. Total revenue fell slightly to $21.3 billion, missing analysts’ average estimate of $21.59 billion. Wells Fargo held onto $3.4 billion of mortgages that it could have sold to Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB, giving up $112 million of revenue. The bank took similar actions last year and had previously said it would hold onto $2 billion to $3 billion of mortgages that closed in January. Total non-interest expenses fell 5 percent from a year earlier. The bank’s net interest margin, a closely watched measure of how much money banks make from their loans, fell to 3.48 percent from 3.91 percent a year earlier. Banks’ margins are shrinking as older loans with higher interest rates are paid down. Wells Fargo shares were down 46 cents at $37.05 in afternoon trading. Investors were likely concerned about the bank’s net interest margin, minimal loan growth and the mortgage business, said Erik Oja, analyst with S&P; Capital IQ. “The only thing that was really impressive about the quarter was the expense reduction,” he said.

693,WFC,Fitch: Wells Fargo 1Q'13 Results: Lower Credit Costs Offset Lower Revenues & Propel Earnings Higher,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 12 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) once again reported a  record quarter with net income of $5.2 billion for the first quarter (1Q'13) for  a strong ROA of 1.49%, according to Fitch Ratings. Lower revenues were offset by  a significant drop in provision expenses and controlled core expense growth.  Revenues declined 3%, reflecting expected declines in mortgage banking revenues  and further margin compression. Spread income was down 1% on a sequential basis  due to two fewer days in the quarter than 4Q'12, while the NIM declined a  further 8bps. This marks the third consecutive quarter of NIM compression for  WFC. Positively, WFC continues to report further declines in U.S. deposit costs  to just 15bps in 1Q'13. Offsetting lower period-end commercial loan balances,  WFC again retained approximately $3 billion of conforming mortgage production,  though down from the $10 billion retained in both 4Q'12 and 3Q'12.  As expected, mortgage revenues fell roughly 9% on a sequential basis, reflecting  lower mortgage origination volumes. Mortgage originations, applications, and the  pipeline all declined during the quarter, marking the third quarter in a row of  sequential declines in applications and the pipeline. Fitch expects mortgage  revenues to be down industry wide in 2013 given lower refinancing activities.  Nonetheless, mortgage revenues remain very large for WFC, at approximately 26%  of total noninterest income in 2013.  Also impacting noninterest income, as expected, WFC reported lower gains on  equity investments from last quarter, partially offset by improved trading  gains.  Core expenses were 3% higher on a sequential basis. Fitch excluded several items  from 4Q12 in calculating the sequential change in core expenses. Last quarter  expenses were impacted by charges stemming from the foreclosure settlement  agreement with regulators and a $250 million charitable contribution to the  Wells Fargo Foundation. Seasonally higher employee benefits expense drove most  of the sequential increase in core expenses. WFC expects that 2Q13 are expected  to decline from 1Q13.  WFC reported solid asset quality improvement for the quarter. Net charge-offs  fell to a respectable 72bps for the quarter, while nonaccrual balances continued  to decline, shrinking 5% sequentially. WFC continues to report reserves  releases, albeit at continually lower levels. Capital ratios continue to be augmented through earnings generation. WFC's  estimated Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III improved to 8.4% up from 8.2% at  4Q'12.

698,WFC,Exclusive: Wells Fargo cuts approved list of money managers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co is slashing an approved list of money managers and investment vehicles that its stockbrokers market to the firm’s wealthy clients, a change of direction that has rattled the third-largest U.S. brokerage network. Executives said the clampdown protects clients from exposure to a plethora of investment models that have received little oversight. It will also reduce the firm’s risk at a time when litigation and compliance costs are rising industry wide. Money managers affected by the cull range from big names such as JP Morgan Asset Management Inc and Legg Mason to scores of small hedge funds and regional managers. For Legg Mason alone, the number of investment products on the list will shrink to 12 from 56, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. Many of the smaller managers have worked with Wells’ advisers for years, sometimes as former colleagues in the brokerage business. “We want reassurance that the strategies being recommended to our clients...are something we are comfortable with,” said Patricia Loepker, director of externally managed and institutional accounts at Wells Fargo Advisors, the company’s brokerage unit. “Our clients, of course, think they’re good strategies because otherwise we wouldn’t offer them, but it was time for us to deliver on that belief,” she said. Currently the approved list has more than 1,000 investment strategies from about 470 portfolio managers. Starting next month, brokers will no longer be allowed to solicit money for 633 of the strategies offered by 220 of the outside managers, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. The extensive list in part reflects Wells Fargo’s December 2008 acquisition of Wachovia Corp. Wachovia’s broker-dealer was an amalgam of more than a dozen smaller firms - including A.G. Edwards, Prudential Securities and Everen Securities - and brokers at the firms who had ties to many little-known portfolio managers. With 15,354 brokers, Wells Fargo Advisors at the end of 2012 held $58 billion of client assets managed by outside portfolio managers in what are known as separately managed accounts. That ranked Wells fifth among all brokerage firms, according to Cerulli Associates, a consulting firm. Measured by its total managed account assets of $325 billion at the end of this year’s first quarter as well as by its financial adviser count, Wells Fargo is the third-largest broker in the United States. The changes at Wells are centered on its Private Advisor Network, a product in which clients are directed to outside money managers by their financial advisers - as Wells designates its brokers - and pay fees to both the bank and the outside managers. The culling has irritated some of the brokers. Four interviewed by Reuters complained that the changes were unveiled only a few weeks before they are to take effect next month. The brokers, who sought anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to reporters, said Wells is eliminating unique investment choices that clients cannot find at rivals - including unheralded managers with strong records. “They say they are trying to protect my interests but they are shutting down new business in these accounts...,” said a 30-year veteran who produces about $1.4 million of brokerage revenue a year. The advisers also accused Wells of hardball compensation tactics to discourage them from using Network, which they said is more lucrative to many brokers than some other managed money products in which the bank keeps more of the fee. Earlier this year, Wells imposed a surcharge on fees advisers glean from Private Advisor Network accounts. The levy, which some advisers said was buried in the company’s 2013 compensation plan, raised protests from high-producing brokers who said they could lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. Wells backed off by putting a $10,000 annual cap on the charge. It also told portfolio managers it may consider reinstating some investment strategies after a year if there is enough interest from advisers and a “need within the asset class.” Wells acknowledges some of the broker discontent but insists it has little choice because of its inability to adequately monitor the qualifications and track records of so many outside managers. “Advisers are very entrepreneurial and independent and they like to demonstrate their independence with a broad range of managers,” said David Carroll, head of Wells’ wealth, brokerage and retirement division. “The problem is that we can’t keep up.” Under the new policy, clients can opt to remain in investment strategies being lopped from the approved list, but new money is subject to a $2 million minimum and can be invested in a non-approved strategy only at the client’s request. The current Wells minimum is $100,000, though some outside managers have higher requirements. If clients pull their money, advisers could lose additional compensation cut since they are paid on total assets invested in the separately managed account program. Outside managers, meanwhile, worry about the timetable. In October, the bank will alert clients that it has stopped doing due diligence on products that have fallen off the list, according to internal documents reviewed by Reuters. “If a heavy-handed letter goes out telling clients to use the strategies at their own risk, we’d be concerned,” said John Ranft, a salesman and former sales director at Navallier & Associates, a Las Vegas portfolio manager that is losing 17 strategies and keeping six in Network. Wells Fargo is now negotiating with some managers on the Private Advisor Network’s approved list to also list the strategies on a second platform called Masters, Wells’ Loepker said. That program, which offers what are known as wrap-fee accounts in which clients pay a single fee for management and administrative services, currently has about 80 managers offering about 185 strategies. Within two-and-a-half years Wells expects it to have about 125 managers with 500 strategies, Loepker said. Clients whose outside managers move to Masters would pay lower fees than in Network and, in some cases, be subject to lower account minimums, she said. A Wells spokeswoman declined to comment on some advisers’ contention that the bank makes more money from the wrap-fee than from the separately managed account. Several outside managers said the winnowing of Wells’ approved list brings the firm in line with its rivals, leading to a greater homogenization of investment choices for investors. They declined to be identified, since many are hoping to requalify strategies for Wells approved list and its wide reach among retail investors. Still, portfolio managers said they were taken aback by the shift at Wells and how it might affect the firm’s reputation as being open than rivals to smaller managers recommended by its advisers. “Wells had a very liberal strategy,” said Navallier’s Ranft. “If one strategy was approved, you could basically get any others added to the list.” ",4152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wellsfargo-list/exclusive-wells-fargo-cuts-approved-list-of-money-managers-idUSBRE93E06O20130415
699,WFC,Commerzbank closing in on 4-bln-stg Eurohypo deal - report,"April 17 (Reuters) - Commerzbank AG, Germany’s second-biggest lender, is in exclusive talks to sell its UK property business Eurohypo to private equity firm Lone Star and U.S. bank Wells Fargo & Co, the Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the talks. The FT reported the 4-billion-pound deal, if successful, would mean Lone Star controlling Eurohypo’s distressed debt and Wells Fargo the performing loans. Commerzbank declined to comment on the report. Cash-strapped European banks, including bailed-out Commerzbank, have so far been reluctant to shed assets to rebuild their weakened balance sheets as sales could force them to recognise losses in their portfolios. Other bidders, such as private equity groups Blackstone Group LP, Apollo and Starwood Capital, and asset manager Pimco, were informed on Wednesday that their bids had been rejected, the Financial Times said. Commerzbank last year decided to wind down Hypothekenbank Frankfurt International, previously known as Eurohypo, which does not underwrite new business anymore but runs off existing loans.

701,WFC,UPDATE 2-Penney in talks with some parties for a new loan -WSJ,"April 18 (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc is speaking with Wells Fargo & Co and others, including parties that invest in troubled companies, about a new loan to help it buttress its cash reserves, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. Other parties involved in talks about providing funds for the loan include a lending unit of private equity firm TPG and Gordon Brothers Group, an investment firm that sometimes finances troubled retailers, those people said, according to the paper. Penney, Wells Fargo, TPG and Gordon Brothers declined to comment. Also on Thursday, the troubled retailer said its chief operating officer, Michael Kramer, and chief talent officer, Daniel Walker, left the company, confirming earlier press reports. Both executives had worked at Apple Inc with ousted CEO Ron Johnson. Kramer will receive a lump sum cash payment of $2.14 million. The loan - in the amount of $500 million - would come due in five years and be backed by Penney’s inventory, accounts receivable and intellectual property, the people said, according to the report. Penney’s merchandise inventory decreased by $575 million, or 19.7 percent, to $2.34 billion at the end of fiscal 2012 as the company worked on efforts such as setting up specialized shops within its large department stores. Discussions were active on Thursday and the group’s membership was still fluid, but a deal could be reached within days, the people said, according to the Journal. On Monday, Penney said it had borrowed $850 million from its $1.85 billion revolving credit facility as it revamps its business strategy following the departure of Chief Executive Ron Johnson. Under Johnson, Penney tried to eliminate coupons and turned off its core shoppers, leading to steep declines in revenue. Last week, Penney brought back Johnson’s predecessor, Myron Ullman, who is expected to return to the chain’s old pricing strategy, which relied heavily on coupons to draw in shoppers. Separately on Thursday, a New York judge ruled that Penney can sell Martha Stewart goods under a “JCP Everyday” label, at least until an appeal by Macy’s Inc is decided. Macy’s claims it has the exclusive right to sell Martha Stewart goods in categories such as bedding, bath and tableware, under a 2006 agreement that runs to 2018. It sued Penney and Stewart’s company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, after they announced a partnership in December 2011.

Penney Co Inc is speaking with Wells Fargo & Co and others, including parties that invest in troubled companies, about a new loan to help it shore up its cash reserves, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. Other parties involved in talks about providing funds for the loan include a lending unit of private-equity firm TPG and Gordon Brothers Group, an investment firm that sometimes finances troubled retailers, those people said, according to the paper. Penney and Wells Fargo declined to comment. The $500 million loan would come due in five years and be backed by Penney’s inventory, accounts receivable and intellectual property, the people said, according to the report.

The 11-member RMG Asset Management group, which oversees more than $1 billion in client assets at Wells, joined Stifel’s private client group in early April, Stifel said. The team had previously been affiliated with Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, Wells’ independent broker-dealer unit.

Also joining are advisers Andrew Campbell and Lance McIntosh, both senior vice presidents, as well as advisers Jennifer Rush, T. Kevin Tucker, Michael Harkins, Glen Ness, Richard O’Donnell and Michael J.P. Tucker. The Portland office includes advisers Joan Fisher and Jeffrey Wirth, who both joined as senior vice presidents. Stifel, Nicolaus & Co is a subsidiary of St. Louis-based financial services holding company Stifel Financial Corp.

709,WFC,IRS eyes U.S. accounts at Caribbean bank,"(Reuters) - The Justice Department said on Tuesday that a federal court had authorized the Internal Revenue Service to seek information on U.S. taxpayers who may have accounts at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce FirstCaribbean International Bank (FCIB). In a move resembling a recent IRS inquiry into Americans with Swiss bank accounts, the Justice Department said a court order would let the IRS serve a ‘John Doe’ summons seeking records of FCIB’s U.S. correspondent account at Wells Fargo & Co. A correspondent account is a bank deposit account maintained by one bank for another bank. The order would allow the IRS to identify U.S. taxpayers with “interests in financial accounts at FCIB and other financial institutions that used FCIB’s Wells Fargo correspondent account,” the Justice Department said in a statement. “Our work here shows our resolve to pursue these cases in all parts of the world, regardless of whether the person hiding money overseas chooses a bank with no offices on U.S. soil,” IRS Acting Commissioner Steven Miller said in a statement. A spokesman for Wells Fargo said the bank would “review the summons and respond as legally required.” An FCIB spokeswoman said the bank intended to “cooperate with authorities in accordance with the respective laws of all jurisdictions involved” and to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. The bank was working with Wells Fargo to understand the court order, she said in a prepared statement. FCIB, based in Barbados, has branches in 18 Caribbean countries. According to its website, the bank was formed in 2002 by Britain’s Barclays Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). In 2006, CIBC became the bank’s majority shareholder, according to the website. CIBC did not immediately reply to requests for comment. FCIB does not have U.S. branches but it has a correspondent account in the United States at Wells Fargo, Justice said. The IRS uses ‘John Doe’ summonses to get information on possible tax law breakers whose identities are unknown. “This John Doe summons directs Wells Fargo to produce records identifying U.S. taxpayers with accounts at FCIB and other banks that used FCIB’s correspondent account,” the statement said. In a declaration filed to the court, a senior IRS revenue agent said many FCIB customers in the John Doe class may have been under-reporting income, evading income taxes, or otherwise violating the internal revenue laws of the United States. The FCIB case stemmed from information from 129 customers of the Barbados bank and its predecessor banks who took part in an IRS voluntary disclosure program, the Justice Department said. In a similar case in January 2013, a federal court allowed the IRS to serve a ‘John Doe’ summons on Switzerland’s UBS AG, seeking records of Swiss bank Wegelin & Co.’s U.S. correspondent account at UBS. That action was part of a wide-ranging U.S. government effort to crack down on tax avoidance by Americans. Wegelin, Switzerland’s oldest bank, in March agreed to pay nearly $58 million in penalties and said it would shut its doors after admitting to helping wealthy Americans evade taxes. The serving of ‘John Doe’ summons on correspondent accounts is likely to become more common as the government widens its tax inquiries beyond Switzerland, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein, said William Sharp, a lawyer who represents taxpayers.

711,WFC,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo in $105 mln pact over Medical Capital -court papers,"* Settlement averts trial that was set for Tuesday * Medical Capital shut down after SEC sued for fraud * Bank of New York Mellon settled in February for $114 million By Nate Raymond April 30 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co agreed Tuesday to pay $105 million to settle an investor lawsuit over its role as trustee for debt issued by a financing company that fell apart in a billion-dollar fraud in 2009, court papers show. The settlement, disclosed in court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, California, followed a judge’s decision earlier this month rejecting Wells Fargo’s bid to dismiss the case. The lawsuit stemmed from the collapse of medical receivables financing company Medical Capital Holdings Inc. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Medical Capital and two executives for fraud in July 2009, and the company was soon shut down. The investors, who had bought notes issued by three Medical Capital special purpose companies, had reached a $114 million settlement with Bank of New York Mellon Corp in February. Wells Fargo had until recently been set to face a jury Tuesday in a three- to- four-week trial in the class action. But the trial date was vacated April 22 amid settlement talks, said Mark Molumphy, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy. The plaintiffs planned to seek damages of $200 million to $300 million from Wells Fargo, Molumphy said. Total damages against both it and BNY Mellon were estimated at up to $400 million, he said. “The settlements represent a significant portion of the losses attributed to the banks,” Molumphy said. Jen Hibbard, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, said the bank was pleased to put the case behind it. “This case is really about a fraud committed by Medical Capital, which unfortunately caused a number of parties to suffer losses,” she said. Medical Capital had raised $1.7 billion from 20,000 investors from 2003 to July 2009 when the SEC sued it for fraud, according to court papers. A receiver later estimated investors lost $839 million to $1.08 billion, and said the Tustin, California-based company used a “Ponzi-like scheme” to extract excess fees. Joseph Lampariello, the former president of Medical Capital, pleaded guilty in May 2012 to criminal wire fraud related to the alleged scheme. His sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 26. In the case of Wells Fargo, the bank had been the trustee for three Medical Capital special purpose companies. Investors sued, claiming the bank had breached its duties under the trust agreements and sent hundreds of millions of dollars to Medical Capital. Wells Fargo denied the allegations.

717,WFC,Mickelson grabs Quail Hollow lead at halfway mark,"(Reuters) - Phil Mickelson, spotless with his putter, surged into a two-shot lead at Friday’s halfway mark of the Wells Fargo Championship by firing a five-under-par 67 at Quail Hollow in Charlotte, North Carolina. The big lefthander made everything from inside 10 feet on the soft greens, making him 31-for-31 from those distances during the first 36 holes for a nine-under total of 135. Tied for second on 137 were fellow Americans Nick Watney (70) and George McNeil (68), and Australian Scott Gardiner (67), who made four birdies in a row from the sixth in bouncing back after missing his last eight cuts on the PGA Tour. Another stroke away was a group that included world number two Rory McIlroy (71) of Northern Ireland, Englishman Lee Westwood, who shot a 68 despite feeling under the weather with a chest infection, and Australian Rod Pampling (69), the 10th and last alternate to join the field. Mickelson, who considers the course one of his favorites and has finished 12th or better seven times in nine appearances, took advantage of greens softened by rain and cool temperatures, including two putting surfaces resodded just seven days ago. “They’re slower so we can be more aggressive, and I’ve made a concerted effort to give myself uphill putts which allows me to take a lot of the break out and be aggressive,” Mickelson said after the round. “On this course they have a lot of holes that are repelling, where if you miss it just a little bit it will kick the ball away. When the greens are firm and fast you have to respect that and play about 20 or 30 feet away. But with the greens softer we’re able to fly it at the hole and stop it.” McIlroy, looking for his first win this season after switching his ball and clubs this year, shared in a seven-way tie for the overnight lead after a first-round 67 but fell back after a one-under 71 on Friday. “The greens were a lot faster today than they happened to be yesterday afternoon,” said McIlroy, who started in the morning wave. “It took a little bit of time to get adjusted. But I think this week it’s all about fairways and greens. “If you’ve given yourself the chances, you take a few of them and you’ll be right there,” he added after hitting 15 greens in regulation. Mickelson praised the layout, which will host the 2017 PGA Championship, and said it would mean a lot to him to carry on to victory. “I think from tee to green it’s one of the best we have, one of the best I’ve ever seen in the game,” said Mickelson, who hit only five of 14 fairways but rescued himself with fine recovery shots, and chips and sand shots from around the green. Mickelson ranked a lowly 130th in the field in driving accuracy and just 103rd in hitting greens in regulation. “It’s a tournament I’ve had many opportunities, a lot of great chances to win,” he said. “I’ve had great finishes here but I haven’t capped it off.

The Northern Irishman was joined atop the leaderboard by Americans Nick Watney, Ryan Moore, Robert Garrigus, Daniel Summerhays, Derek Ernst and Monday qualifier Nate Smith. Another six players were one stroke back, including former Masters champions Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson, and former U.S. Open champion Lucas Glover, who won this event in 2011. McIlroy, still looking for his first tournament victory this year, struggled early in the season to find his top form after switching his golf ball and clubs. “I’ve made big strides,” said McIlroy, who will turn 24 on Saturday. “My game wasn’t where it should have been at all in the beginning of the year. Now I feel like I’m swinging it well. I’ve seen my game progress week by week. It’s a nice start here this week.” McIlroy may have landed in the perfect place to get back on the winning track. He fired a spectacular final-round 62 to win the 2010 tournament for his first U.S. tour win and last year went to a playoff won by Rickie Fowler. Soft conditions prevailed on a cool, damp overcast day on a course where the greens held approach shots, but posed a challenge to putt after being damaged by a harsh winter. Two of the greens, the eighth and 10th, were completely resodded just seven days ago, and several others were splotchy and pitted by spike marks as the day wore on. McIlroy felt he was ready to contend last month at the Masters, but soared to a back-nine 42 on Saturday on his way to a 79. He shot 69 in the final round at Augusta to tie for 25th. “I took the best part of two weeks off,” McIlroy said about recharging following the year’s first major. “Then I had four days of good practice. I feel good about my game.” Summerhays reached six under par with a birdie at the 15th, but missed a three-footer to save par at the par-three 17th to fall back. Smith, who shot a 63 to qualify on Monday for his first PGA Tour start of the season, also held the sole lead for a hole after he birdied 16 to reach six-under but he missed a four-foot putt for par at the 17th to slip back. Defending champion Fowler fired an even-par 72. ",5032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga/mcilroy-among-seven-tied-for-wells-fargo-lead-idUSBRE94200C20130503
719,WFC,"Mickelson, Watney stumble at end to share Quail Hollow lead","(Reuters) - Phil Mickelson and Nick Watney survived some late-round misadventures to emerge from Saturday’s third round tied for the lead in the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow in Charlotte, North Carolina. Mickelson topped the leaderboard for most of the day and Watney took his turn alone in first place late in the day before both players fell back after double-bogeys to head into Sunday’s final round knotted at eight-under-par 208. Their fellow-American George McNeil bogeyed the 18th to fall out of a three-way tie for the lead and was alone in third place on seven-under 209. The stumbles by the leaders brought a slew of other contenders into prime position. Two strokes off the pace at six-under-par 210 were Britons Lee Westwood (72) and David Lynn (71), Ryan Moore (68), Australian John Senden (67), Robert Karlsson of Sweden (69) and American Derek Ernst (72). Five players were another shot away, including world number two Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland, who struggled with his putter on the way to posting a one-over 73 for 211. Players will be grouped in threesomes and start earlier than usual on Sunday as forecasts call for possible heavy rains overnight that could last until Monday.

720,WFC,Rookie Ernst beats Lynn in playoff at Quail Hollow,"(Reuters) - Rookie Derek Ernst crowned a fairy tale week by parring the first hole of a sudden-death playoff on Sunday to beat Briton David Lynn and win the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow in Charlotte, North Carolina. Ernst, 22, who sank a four-foot birdie putt on the 72nd hole to tie for the lead, won his first PGA Tour title with a tap-in par at the par-four 18th after Lynn, runner-up at last year’s PGA Championship, got into trouble off the tee in sudden death. “It feels incredible,” Ernst said in a greenside TV interview. “It’s just unbelievable. This feeling is incredible. My heart’s beating a million miles an hour.” Entering the field as the fourth alternate, Ernst won his maiden title in his eighth start on the tour this year. The Californian’s previous best finish was a tie for 41st at the 2012 Frys.com Open. Lynn hit his tee shot on the playoff hole into deep rough on the banks of a creek on the left, put his second shot into a greenside bunker and then overshot the green. His chip ran eight feet past the cup, allowing the American to win with par. Ernst won with steady ball-striking, a smooth putting stroke and some brilliant play at the 18th, the hardest hole of the week. He had totaled $28,255 in PGA Tour earnings this year before pocketing a winner’s prize of more than $1 million. Phil Mickelson led by a stroke going into the last three holes but bogeyed 16 and 17 to fall one shot short of joining the playoff. The big left-hander finished third at seven-under 281 after a 73. Ernst and Lynn both shot final rounds of two-under-par 70 to tie at eight-under-par 280 on a wet, chilly day that brought golfers out at 6:45 a.m. in hopes of beating the stormy weather forecast for later in the day. With some players pulling out before the event due to damaged greens at Quail Hollow after unseasonably cold weather, Ernst got his Wells Fargo invite and headed to Charlotte instead of to a Web.com Tour event in Georgia. Besides the immediate balm to his bank account, the victory brought Ernst a wealth of opportunities. It qualified him for next week’s Players Championship, two World Golf Championships, the PGA Championship, next year’s Tournament of Champions and the Masters. He had entered the tournament ranked 1,207th in the world. His path to victory was paved in part by Mickelson’s troubles in the closing holes. Mickelson, who double-bogeyed the par-five 15th and bogeyed 17 in the third round, held a one-shot lead entering the last three holes, known as the Green Mile, before stumbling again. “I’m pretty bummed out. I thought this was one I had in control. Then I bogeyed 16 and 17, there’s just no excuse,” said a frustrated Mickelson, who has finished fifth or better four times at Quail Hollow but has yet to win. For the 39-year-old Lynn, it was his second top-10 finish of the season, following a tie for fourth at the Honda Classic. Two strokes off the pace at six-under were Englishman Lee Westwood (72) and Robert Karlsson of Sweden (72). At five under par were Americans Kevin Streelman, Ryan Moore, Bo Van Pelt and Kim Stanley, one shot better than a group of six that included world number two Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland and England’s Ross Fisher.

722,WFC,"Berkshire reveals CB&I; stake, adds to Wells Fargo","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Wednesday revealed a new investment in Chicago Bridge & Iron Co and said it has added to its largest equity holding, Wells Fargo & Co. The changes were disclosed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing Berkshire’s $85 billion of equity investments listed on U.S. exchanges as of March 31. Earlier this month, Berkshire said it had $95.9 billion of equity securities overall, and Buffett indicated that the bulk of the company’s investments will stay in the United States. “If you told us we could only invest in the United States for the rest of our lives, we wouldn’t regard this as a huge hardship,” Buffett said on May 4 at Berkshire’s annual meeting in its hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. The company also owns more than 80 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, utilities, chemicals, apparel and food. Berkshire said it has taken a roughly 6.51 million-share stake in CB&I;, one of the largest U.S.-listed engineering companies. The stake was worth about $404.2 million as of March 31. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire discloses new investments, and CBI shares rose 3.4 percent to $59.75 in after-hours trading. They had closed down 14 cents at $57.76. Berkshire also boosted its stake in Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, by about 4 percent from year end to 458.2 million shares. Those shares were worth about $16.95 billion on March 31, roughly the current market value of high-end clothing retailer Ralph Lauren Corp. Berkshire’s top four equity holdings - Wells Fargo, American Express Co, Coca-Cola Co and International Business Machines Corp - were worth about $57.9 billion as of March 31, according to Wednesday’s filing. While large Berkshire investments are made by Buffett, smaller investments are often made by portfolio managers Todd Combs or Ted Weschler. Wednesday’s filing does not indicate who makes individual investments. Buffett, a buy-and-hold investor, has indicated that at least one of them trades more often than he does. On May 7, Weschler signed an agreement on Berkshire’s behalf allowing the company to boost its 14.2 percent stake in DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc, the largest U.S. operator of dialysis clinics, to as much as 25 percent. Berkshire added in the quarter to its stake in DaVita, and its stakes in several other companies including US Bancorp, retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc, satellite TV provider DirecTV and oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc. It also reported a new stake in premium TV cable network Starz, which was spun off in January Liberty Media Corp, which continues to be a Berkshire holding. It also reduced its stakes in food companies Kraft Foods Group Inc and Mondelez International Inc, and no longer reports stakes in grain trader Archer Daniels Midland Co and defense contractor General Dynamics Corp. In April, Berkshire began trimming what had been a 12.7 percent stake in Moody’s Corp, the parent of credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service. It has held a double-digit percentage stake in Moody’s for more than a decade. Shares of Berkshire set record highs during Wednesday trading but closed mixed. The Class A shares fell $327 to $168,940, and the Class B shares rose 10 cents to $112.77.

724,WFC,Wells Fargo ordered to pay $203 million in overdraft case,"(Reuters) - A federal judge has again ordered Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) to pay $203 million to settle class action litigation accusing it of imposing excessive overdraft fees on checking account customers, reviving an award that had been thrown out last year. U.S. District Judge William Alsup reinstated on Tuesday a penalty he first imposed in August 2010, saying the fourth-largest U.S. bank violated a California law that protects consumers against fraudulent misrepresentations. “Wells Fargo was profiting off its most vulnerable customers and this holds the bank accountable,” Richard McCune, a partner at McCuneWright in Redlands, California, representing about 1 million current and former Wells Fargo customers in that state, said in an interview. “We think it’s the right decision.” Richele Messick, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, said the San Francisco-based bank plans to appeal. “We don’t believe that the ruling is in line with facts of this case or the law,” she said. The lawsuit is separate from nationwide litigation still pending in Miami federal court against about 20 lenders, including Wells Fargo, over alleged excessive overdraft fees. Consumers often incur the roughly $25 or $35 fees when they overdraw their checking accounts through debit card purchases. Wells Fargo had been accused of maximizing overdraft fees by processing such purchases from the largest to the smallest rather than chronologically since 2001. It has since changed its account posting practices, as have many rivals. In December, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the original $203 million award, saying federal law preempted part of a California law on which Alsup had relied in imposing an injunction to stop improper fee practices. But the 9th Circuit said federal law did not displace California consumer law with respect to fraudulent or misleading representations and directed Alsup to review the case again. In reinstating the award, Alsup rejected what he called Wells Fargo’s effort to “slice its resequencing scheme” into multiple parts, reducing its overall liability. The award punishes Wells Fargo “for affirmatively misleading the class as to what (its) practice was, namely engaging in a practice likely to mislead the class to believe that processing would be done in chronological order. “Because Wells Fargo misrepresented the posting order and overdraft charges to its customers, the appropriate form of restitution is to restore the unexpected charges to Wells Fargo’s customers,” Alsup added. The judge also permanently barred Wells Fargo from further misleading customers about the posting of transactions. He said he will consider fees for the customers’ lawyers later. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) paid $410 million and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) paid $110 million to settle their portions of the nationwide litigation. Those settlements won final court approval in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Both banks have also changed their overdraft fee practices. The case is Gutierrez et al v.

726,WFC,New York claims more proof of bank mortgage abuses,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said there is mounting evidence that Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Wells Fargo and Co (WFC.N) and other banks violated the terms of a settlement designed to end mortgage servicing abuses. Schneiderman - who has said he plans to sue Bank of America and Wells Fargo for failing to live up to their obligations under the deal - said other states had found similar problems. “Several other states have identified similar recurring deficiencies by the participating servicers,” Schneiderman said in a letter dated May 23 to the monitor for the settlement, former North Carolina Banking Commissioner Joseph Smith. The letter was obtained by Reuters on Friday. The $25 billion settlement was brokered last year between five banks and 49 state attorneys general. The other banks are JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), and Ally Financial Inc GKM.N. The banks agreed to provide relief to homeowners and comply with a set of servicing standards to atone for foreclosure misconduct. In his letter, Schneiderman did not identify which other states had provided evidence of banks failing to abide by the settlement. Nor did he identify the banks with recurring deficiencies. He said receipt of his letter to Smith and a concurrent one to a monitoring committee would start the clock on a waiting period before lawsuits could be filed against the banks. The settlement authorizes the monitor to first work with a mortgage servicer to correct any potential violations and sue if the servicer does not fix the errors. Schneiderman said on May 6 he planned to sue Bank of America and Wells Fargo after the waiting period was over, although he did not mention the possibility of a lawsuit in Thursday’s letter. At the time, Schneiderman said that, since last October, his office had documented 339 violations of standards - 210 by Wells Fargo and 129 by Bank of America - dictating the timeline for banks to process mortgage modification applications. In Thursday’s letter, Schneiderman said the violations reveal the two banks “are engaging in much of the same misconduct that precipitated the National Mortgage Settlement.” Smith said in a statement Friday he would review the violations Schneiderman shared. He also said he will issue a report on the banks’ compliance in June. “I intend to use the full breadth of my power under the settlement to hold the banks accountable,” he said. North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper, who is on the monitoring committee, said in a conference call on Tuesday that some banks have “fallen short” of complying with servicing standards. He did not name any banks. In Thursday’s letter, Schneiderman said there had been “inordinate delays” in reviewing loan modification applications at Wells Fargo, so applicants had to resubmit documents. He cited evidence of piecemeal requests for additional documents in one modification application at Bank of America, and said more than three months passed without a request for more information or a decision on another application. Bank of America has said it did not commit any violations, and that it has provided more relief under the settlement than any other servicer. Wells Fargo has said it was committed to abiding by the settlement. Citibank said on Friday it remains committed to fulfilling the terms of the settlement. JPMorgan spokesman Tom Kelly declined to comment. Ally said its bankrupt mortgage subsidiary Residential Capital is responsible for the settlement. A spokesperson for ResCap could not immediately be reached for comment. On Tuesday, Smith reported that the five banks in the settlement had distributed $50 billion in direct relief to over 620,000 homeowners as part of the settlement.

Weekley was one shot behind compatriot and overnight leader Matt Kuchar when play began at Colonial Country Club but used a string of birdies to top a crowded leaderboard that featured 22 players within five shots of the lead after the third round. The 39-year-old Weekley offset two early birdies with bogeys at the par-four fifth and par-four seventh holes but recovered with birdies at four of his next six holes en route to a 14-under total of 266 that left him one shot ahead of Kuchar. Kuchar (68) birdied the par-four 18th to finish alone in second place, one stroke ahead of fellow American and former Masters champion Zach Johnson (66). Americans Scott Stallings (66), John Rollins (68) and Matt Every (69) were all a further shot back in a share of fourth place. Weekley’s last triumph had come at the former Verizon Heritage, now known as the RBC Heritage, in 2008 during a period where he rose to popularity before injuries and poor form zapped his game. Known for his Southern sensibilities and sense of humor, Weekley is a charming figure that helped the Unites States capture the Ryder Cup in 2008.

728,WFC,Stars from worn U.S. flags used by New York group to honor military,"TROY, New York (Reuters) - Stars cut from worn-out U.S. flags will be handed out on Memorial Day to men and women in the military and veterans as part of a campaign called Stars For Our Troops that recognizes service to country. Susan Wells, who started the project, collects discarded and damaged U.S. flags and removes the stars. Each one is washed and pressed, then placed in a small bag with a note that reads: “I am part of our American flag that has flown over a home in the U.S.A. I can no longer fly. The sun and winds have caused me to become tattered and torn. Please carry me as a reminder that you are not forgotten.” The stars are distributed at events such as Memorial Day parades and through the group's website at www.starsforourtroops.org/. “When I had a soldier crying on my shoulder and thanking me for remembering his service, I knew it was right,” said Wells, of Troy, New York, who works with about a dozen volunteers. The U.S. Flag Code, part of federal law governing display of the flag, requires that flags be “destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning.” Wells said synthetic fabrics, which are used for heavy-duty sewn flags, are more difficult to burn than cotton or other natural materials. Stars For Our Troops is an alternative to disposing of damaged U.S. flags. “The majority of people appreciate the symbolism of what we are doing and our love for our country and our armed forces,” said Wells. “However, some people have questioned whether it is permissible to cut the flag. This debate is what this country is all about.” The project is getting help from Gettysburg Flag Works in East Greenbush, New York, which last year collected 2,787 flags. “If you multiply that by 50 stars, it is a lot of stars,” said Cheryl Rings, the store’s marketing director. Rachel Wallace started sending flags to Wells about two years ago and then started a branch of her own in Lakeway, Texas. She has kept it going from where she now lives in Ringgold, Georgia. “There are always flags that will be old and worn and need to be retired,” Wallace said. “They give new life to something that wouldn’t live on.” Donated flags sometimes arrive with letters of explanation. Wells said four flags she recently received had 48 stars, the design before Alaska was granted statehood in 1959. One of them, according to the sender, had flown over Washington, D.C. on December 11, 1941, the day the United States declared war on Germany. Wells began the project in 2010 when she was laid off from her job at a department store and was looking for volunteer work. She learned about a similar program started by four Florida women in 2005 called the Star Project. Through groups such as Forgotten Soldiers, Military Mom in Action and the Major Stuart Adam Wolfer Institute, stars are also placed in packages to men and women in the military. “I even hand them out to soldiers in the grocery store,” she said. “I love to see them smile when I give it to them.” ",5262013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-memorialday-stars/stars-from-worn-u-s-flags-used-by-new-york-group-to-honor-military-idUSBRE94P03Y20130526

Even as stocks soared to new highs in 2013, memories of the 2008 financial crisis and lingering distrust have kept many retail investors from jumping back into the stock market with the vigor they had pre-crisis, the brokerage executives said ahead of the Reuters Global Wealth Management Summit, which starts on Monday. “There’s still a pretty vivid memory of what happened in 2008, 2009, and the impact to people’s portfolios,” said John Thiel, head of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, in an interview at his New York office. U.S. stocks have taken a roller coaster ride over the past five or so years. The S&P; 500 index hit its last peak in October 2007 at around 1570, then more than halved to hit its low in March 2009 before finally clawing all the way back this year. Investors scared by the volatility often retreated to low-yielding fixed income instruments. Investors are behaving “like most human beings would with the memory of what can happen and isn’t in their favor,” Thiel said. Merrill, owned by Bank of America, and Wells Fargo Advisors, the brokerage unit owned by Wells Fargo & Co, are among the largest U.S. brokerages, with more than $1 trillion in client assets each. Merrill counts roughly 14,500 advisers among its brokerage force, while Wells has just over 15,000 advisers - those who manage the wealth of millions of mom-and-pop investors across the United States. Thiel, who started his own career as an adviser with Merrill in 1989 in Tampa, Florida, said among the biggest hurdles for the industry going forward are to help clients regain their confidence and reorient their focus toward goal-driven wealth management. Many of these goals - such as socking enough money away for retirement - cannot be reached by parking money in low-yielding investments. Equities performed very well for almost 20 years, but have underperformed for 10 years, said Thiel. “You have to change all of that memory,” he said. “When you talk about changing people, that’s hard.” While there was some movement back into stocks in early 2013, after lawmakers in Washington avoided the worst of potentially growth-killing simultaneous tax increases and spending cuts, many retail investors remain sidelined. From January through early March, David Carroll, head of Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement at Wells Fargo, watched clients pour more money into fixed-income than equities. And that is a source of frustration, even as interest rates are nudging up. “Every day, every week, every month that passes, people’s portfolios are incrementally yielding less because they have older-dated (higher yielding) investments that are rolling off,” Carroll said from his Charlotte, North Carolina office. “They have this quandary about what to do.” So far this year through May 29, stock mutual funds have seen inflows of $106 billions, while taxable bond mutual funds have had inflows of $116 billion, according to Lipper, a unit of Thomson Reuters. (Those figures exclude exchange-traded funds, which often attract short-term investors) That disparity was more drastic last year, when investors poured $257.8 billion into fixed-income, while equity funds had outflows of $129.2 billion. Overall, more than $2.6 trillion is stashed in money market funds, according to the Investment Company Institute. The average yield on a money market fund is less than 1 percent, according to Bankrate.com Carroll said a steady diet of economic threats was behind investor wariness, with the recovery in equities doing little to temper those fears. “We need a period of protracted calm, and since 2009 we’ve had no less than a succession of quarterly the-world-is-coming-to-an-end events,” Carroll said, including the flash crash in 2010, the federal debt ceiling debate in late 2011 and federal budget cuts early this year. “If you think back to prior recessions and prior big market corrections, there was a period of calm and it was a return to normalization.” The key for advisers, who are constantly engaged in conversations with clients, is to not only help rebuild trust, but also reorient their approach to wealth management, Thiel said. “What we’re trying to do is evolve to find out what that money is designed to do - is it for a comfortable retirement or is it for their children?” Thiel said. “How long they can invest is important, and so we try to pick the asset that best matches that liability.” Wells is encouraging clients to put their money to work in an effective way, and pushing more clients toward financial plans - a program called Envision that it started in 2004. In the past nine years, more than 80 percent of key households with brokerage accounts at the firm - those with at least $250,000 in assets - have a plan of record. “Our biggest challenge right now is motivating clients simply to take action,” Carroll said.

731,WFC,"ON THE MOVE-Morgan Stanley lands Wells, UBS advisers in Florida","June 4 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, the largest U.S. brokerage, said on Tuesday it has expanded its adviser force in Florida with hires from rival brokerages Wells Fargo Advisors and UBS Wealth Management Americas. Ricardo Kent joined Morgan Stanley’s Plantation, Florida office from Wells Fargo, the St. Louis-based brokerage owned by Wells Fargo & Co.. Kent managed $100 million in client assets at the firm and generated more than $1 million in annual revenue. He now reports to branch manager Giovanni Renteria and complex manager Billy Van Scoyoc. Kent spent a decade at Wells and its predecessor firms, according to regulatory filings. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo confirmed Kent’s departure but declined to comment further. In Miami, Morgan Stanley hired Arturo Castelo Lopez, Jennifer Sierra and Marion Tettke from UBS, where the trio managed $375 million in client assets and produced $3.5 million in annual revenue. The team now reports to complex manager Kevin McCarty. Lopez and Sierra joined UBS in 2009, while Tettke had been there since 2005, regulatory filings show. A spokesman for UBS declined to comment on the team’s move. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, which is minority-owned by Citigroup Inc., was formed out of the merger of Morgan Stanley’s wealth division and Citi’s Smith Barney in 2009. The combined unit created the largest U.S. brokerage by adviser headcount and client assets under management. Last year Morgan Stanley lost several top adviser teams to rivals because of frustrations with the firm’s technology platform and cultural differences with senior management. But speaking at the Reuters Wealth Management Summit on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley wealth management head Greg Fleming said attrition is down throughout the firm, especially among the top 40 percent of advisers as measured by revenue production. That’s happened as wealth management has grown into one of Morgan Stanley’s core businesses, he said.",6042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/morganstanley-advisers/on-the-move-morgan-stanley-lands-wells-ubs-advisers-in-florida-idUSL1N0EG1NX20130604

FINRA ordered Wells Fargo Advisors LLC to reimburse about $2 million and pay an additional $1.25 million in fine. It asked Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit to reimburse about $1.1 million and pay $900,000 in fine. The brokerages have been asked to reimburse the amount because the risk tolerance limit and financial conditions of their customers did not justify the purchases, FINRA said. Floating-rate bank loan funds are mutual funds that generally invest in a portfolio of secured senior loans made to entities whose credit quality is rated below investment-grade. The brokerages neither admitted nor denied the charges.

733,WFC,Wells Fargo buying more bonds as rates rise,"June 5 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co is looking to buy bonds at a faster rate than before to benefit from higher potential returns from investments as U.S. interest rates rise, a top executive said on Wednesday. “The current back-up in rate, we think, is attractive and will allow us to invest at a slightly faster rate than how we were investing maybe 30 days ago and 60 days ago,” Wells Fargo chief financial officer Tim Sloan said at Deutsche Bank’s Global Financial Services Investor Conference on Wednesday. Depositors have been giving Wells Fargo money faster than the bank can lend it out, so the bank has excess funds that it can invest. The bank has about $160 billion in cash and cash-like instruments that was earning essentially nothing because the bank could not find investments offering the right returns given the risk, Wells Fargo chief executive officer John Stumpf said at a separate investor conference last week. That “dry powder” is over 10 percent of the bank’s assets.

The 78-man co-sanctioned event with the Asian Tour was held at the Mines Golf Course last year but the short layout offered little resistance with American Nick Watney shooting a final round 10-under par 61 to win. His 262 total was one shy of Bo Van Pelt’s tournament record low when he won in 2011 on the same course. Both past champions, and 2010 winner Ben Crane, will join Mickelson in this year’s field. The Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country club has a history of hosting high caliber tournaments and has staged the European and Asian Tour’s Malaysian Open for the past four years. Organizers did not say if world number one Tiger Woods, who finished tied fourth last year, would return for the event which will count towards the PGA Tour’s FedExCup for the first time. “I think it’s fantastic that the CIMB Classic is part of the FedExCup,” Mickelson said in a statement on Thursday. “It certainly drives the tournament’s competitiveness and encourages the presence of American golfers in the region.” While prize money has increased from $6.1 million for the October 24-27 event, the presence of Asian Tour players remains limited with only the top 10 from their Order of Merit guaranteed entry.

Argentina’s Andres Romero, who had five holes to finish for the second round when the threat of lightning suspended play on Friday, made a late push to join them but bogeyed the par-five 16th on his way to a 66 and was one shot back on 136.

College Health and Investment Ltd, a family limited partnership, filed the case in Boca Raton, Florida against the Wells Fargo & Co unit in 2010, according to a ruling posted on Tuesday on the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s securities arbitration database. The case stemmed from Wells’ failure to detect alleged theft and unauthorized transactions by an employee of the partnership between 2006 and early 2008, according to Robert Wayne Pearce, a lawyer in Boca Raton, Florida, who represented the partnership. A family limited partnership is an estate planning tool used mainly by wealthy families to preserve their assets and minimize certain tax liabilities. The three-person FINRA securities arbitration panel found Wells liable on July 3 and ordered it to pay $2.3 million in damages and interest to the partnership, College Health and Investment Ltd.

743,WFC,"Wells rides high on 'mortgage horse,' but run may end soon","(Reuters) - The home loan business came through for Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) in the second quarter, helping the biggest U.S. mortgage lender beat Wall Street’s profit expectations, despite fears that lending volume would drop as rates rose. Rising mortgage rates, driven by expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will eventually cut back its economic stimulus program, are expected to weigh on banks’ mortgage business in the coming months. But Wells, the No. 4 U.S. bank by assets, has some 90 businesses, ranging from credit cards to small business loans, that will benefit as the economy improves, the bank’s top executives said on Friday. The mortgage operations contributed just 13 percent of the bank’s more than $21 billion of revenues in the latest quarter. “The mortgage horse has been a big, strong horse. We’ve got 89 other horses that are going to be able to grow,” Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan told analysts on a conference call, referring to the stagecoach that has long been the symbol for Wells Fargo. The bank’s shares were up 1.5 percent to $42.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after touching a new 52-week high of $43.05 earlier in the session. The stock has risen 21 percent this year, compared with a 25 percent rise in the KBW index of bank stocks .BKX. “With Wells Fargo, there were a lot of doubts from large institutional investors who were shorting the shares leading into earnings because of the 30-year (mortgage) rate increasing,” said Tom Jalics, a senior investment analyst with Key Private Bank. “But it turns out the worry in investors’ heads about originations and refinancing falling off a cliff is probably overdone.” Thirty-year mortgage rates rose to 4.58 percent at the end of the second quarter, up 0.82 percentage point from the first quarter. The rise in mortgage rates since early May did slow down home loan refinancing, which accounted for 56 percent of Wells Fargo’s mortgage applications in the second quarter, down from nearly two-thirds in the first quarter. But the bank’s income from making home loans rose 9 percent from a year earlier. Even Wells executives were not expecting the business to hold up that well. “We have continued to be surprised by how housing has positively impacted our results,” Sloan said on the conference call. “Originations in the second quarter were a lot stronger than I think anyone would have imagined.” That may not last long, possibly putting an end to Wells Fargo’s streak of seven consecutive quarters of making more than $100 billion in home loans. Overall, the San Francisco-based bank made $112 billion of home loans in the latest quarter, down from $131 billion a year earlier but up from $109 billion in the first quarter. Income from mortgage lending totaled $2.41 billion. Wells Fargo had a 22 percent share of the U.S. mortgage market in the first quarter, down from 27.7 percent at the end of the 2012 fourth quarter, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the second-biggest provider of mortgages in the United States with an 11 percent market share, also forecast a decline in the mortgage business in the coming months. JPMorgan, the largest in the United States by assets, reported a higher-than-expected 31 percent rise in quarterly profit on Friday. Trading revenue rebounded and it set aside less to cover bad loans. The improving economy and recovering housing market helped Wells Fargo in various ways in the second quarter. Profits got a boost as the bank set aside less money to cover bad loans Net income applicable to common stockholders rose to $5.27 billion, or 98 cents per share, from $4.40 billion, or 82 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts’ average forecast was 93 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was the bank’s 14th consecutive quarter of higher earnings per share. (For a Wells Fargo earnings graphic, click on link.reuters.com/zyc69t) The bank released $500 million in loan loss reserves in the quarter, well above the $200 million released in the first quarter, due to gains in house prices and fewer bad loans. The bank’s provision for bad loans fell 64 percent to $652 million. The increase in rates made it attractive for the bank to add to its investment portfolio by purchasing $21.1 billion in securities in the quarter. “That’s a big increase from what we’ve done in prior quarters,” Sloan told Reuters in an interview, adding the bank has also added $6 billion in securities to its portfolio since the start of the third quarter. The bank’s net interest margin, an indicator of how profitable its loans are, fell to 3.46 percent in the second quarter from 3.91 percent a year earlier and 3.48 percent in the first quarter. Rising interest rates should ease pressure banks have faced on their margins, but that trend will take time to bear fruit. Wells Fargo’s total second-quarter revenue rose marginally, to $21.37 billion from $21.29 billion a year earlier. Revenue from trust and investment fees, which accounted for one-third of the bank’s fee income, jumped to $3.5 billion, up nearly $300 million from the first quarter. Investment banking fees were up 85 percent from a year ago. Non-interest expenses fell to $12.25 billion from $12.40 billion in the first quarter but were $250 million more than analysts expected. The primary reason expenses did not fall further was because revenue-based compensation was higher, Sloan said.

744,WFC,Fitch: Wells Fargo 2Q'13 Results: Lower Credit Costs Propel Earnings Higher Once Again,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 12 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) reported its 14th quarter  in a row of higher net income, with a very strong 1.55% return on assets for  2Q'13. A significant drop in provision expenses drove most of the sequential  quarterly increase. Earnings were also aided by higher spread income, and  controlled non-interest expenses. WFC reported continued strength in mortgage banking, with results relatively  flat on a sequential basis. Mortgage banking accounts for roughly one quarter of  non-interest income. While the pipeline fell for the fourth quarter in a row,  WFC reported a slight increase in quarterly originations and applications.  Further, the refinance/purchase mix continues to improve, reflecting the  wind-down of the significant refinancing activities, as well as the recent  pick-up in home sales. Fitch would expect WFC to report lower mortgage revenues  in 2H'13 reflecting the recent back-up of rates.  Reflecting the strength of the housing market, WFC released $500 million in  reserves, compared to $200 million last quarter. In line with the industry,  reserve releases have generally been on a declining trend since 1Q'11 for the  company. WFC disclosed that absent a material deterioration in the economy, the  company expects further reserve releases.  WFC reported strong asset quality improvement, with quarterly net charge-offs  (NCOs) falling to just 58bps. Much of the improvement is attributed to better  consumer credit quality, particularly 1-4 family residential and home equity  performance. That said, Fitch notes that NCOs at this level are likely not  sustainable, with historical losses more around the 100bps range.  Other highlights for the quarter include strong growth in trust and investment  fees, reflecting higher investment banking and increased retail brokerage  asset-based fees. This was somewhat offset by lower market-sensitive revenues,  as WFC reported lower gains on trading activities.  Mortgage repurchase expenses fell significantly for the quarter, down to just  $65 million, as compared to the prior four quarter average of approximately $450  million. Further, WFC's net interest margin (NIM) compression was just 2bps  during the quarter, much better than reported over the past several quarters.  Tier 1 common under Basel III improved slightly to an estimated 8.54% at June  30, 2013. Higher retained earnings were offset by a much smaller contribution  from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), as unrealized gains fell  approximately $6 billion during the quarter. AOCI had a negative impact on Tier  1 common under Basel III of 24bps during the quarter. As an Advanced Approach  bank, WFC will be subject to fluctuations in AOCI under Basel III once it comes  into effect Jan. 1, 2014.

745,WFC,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Wells Fargo benefits from housing market, but clouds loom","(Corrects the share of Wells Fargo’s refinancing activity to 56 percent from 54 percent in the 10th paragraph) By Peter Rudegeair July 12 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, posted a higher-than-expected 20 percent rise in quarterly profit on Friday as it set aside less money to cover bad loans and earned more from its mortgage business. The results reflect the strengthening U.S. housing market, which is cutting the bank’s expenses for items such as managing foreclosed homes. Income from making home loans rose 9 percent from a year earlier. Mortgage lending gains may slow in coming quarters, analysts said. Mortgage interest rates have risen in recent months as longer-term bonds have sold off, which will likely cut into future mortgage lending profit. Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf said on a conference call that the bank is diversified and has some businesses that perform better when rates rise. The fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets said net income applicable to common stockholders rose to $5.27 billion, or 98 cents per share, in the second quarter from $4.40 billion, or 82 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 93 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was the bank’s 14th consecutive quarter of higher earnings per share. (For a Wells Fargo earnings graphic, click on link.reuters.com/zyc69t) The bank’s provision for bad loans fell 64 percent to $652 million. The rise in U.S. interest rates since early May contributed to a slowdown in mortgage refinancing, which accounted for 56 percent of Wells Fargo’s mortgage applications in the second quarter, down from nearly two-thirds in the first quarter. Overall U.S. demand for refinancing fell 45 percent in the latest quarter, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Wells Fargo made $112 billion of home loans in the quarter, down from $131 billion a year earlier but up from $109 billion in the first quarter. Income from mortgage lending totaled $2.41 billion. Wells Fargo had a 22 percent share of the U.S. mortgage market in the first quarter, down from 27.7 percent at the end of the 2012 fourth quarter, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication. Thirty-year mortgage rates rose to 4.58 percent at the end of the second quarter, up 0.82 percentage point from the first quarter. Wells Fargo shares were up 2 percent at $42.74 in morning trading. The stock has risen about 20 percent this year, roughly in line with the increase in the KBW index of bank stocks. The bank’s net interest margin, an indicator of how profitable its loans are, fell to 3.46 percent in the second quarter from 3.91 percent a year earlier and 3.48 percent in the first quarter. Rising interest rates should ease pressure banks have faced on their margins, but that trend will take time to bear fruit. Wells Fargo’s total second-quarter revenue rose marginally, to $21.37 billion from $21.29 billion a year earlier. Non-interest expenses fell to $12.25 billion from $12.40 billion. JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported a higher-than-expected 31 percent rise in quarterly profit earlier on Friday. Its trading revenue rebounded and it set aside less to cover bad loans.

The S&P; 500 index and the Dow industrials  closed at record highs on Thursday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. central bank will keep monetary policy loose for some time to lower the unemployment rate.

But United Parcel Service Inc dropped 5.2 percent to $86.22 - the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 - after the world’s No.1 package delivery company estimated second-quarter profit would be below analysts’ expectations due to overcapacity in the world freight market.

The three players all parred the first four holes of the playoff despite having chances to win at TPC Deere Run, setting up the finish in Silvis, Illinois.

752,WFC,Summerhays looking for swift redemption on PGA Tour,"(Reuters) - Four days after a final hole bogey cost him a place in a playoff, Daniel Summerhays set out to atone for his near-miss by snatching the early lead at the Sanderson Farms Championship on Thursday. The American shot a bogey-free nine-under-par 63 at the Annandale Golf Club in Madison, Mississippi to open up a three-stroke lead in the uncompleted first round. He carded seven birdies and an eagle to forge clear of fellow Americans Will Claxton, Michael Bradley and Jonathan Randolph, who shot matching rounds of 66. Seven players - Americans Bill Lunde, Dicky Pride, Skip Kendall, D.J. Trahan, Chad Campbell, Donald Constable and Australian Peter Lonard - finished tied for fifth at five-under on a wild day where play was stopped because of thunderstorms. Summerhays started on the back nine of the course and was two-under through eight before he went on an scoring blitz. It began with an eagle on the 18th, continued with a birdie on the first and featured three consecutive birdies between the third and fifth holes before his final gained shot on the seventh left him with a big cushion. The 29-year-old from Utah has hit a purple patch of form in recent weeks, finishing ninth at the Greenbrier then fourth in Illinois last week. He stood on the 18th fairway at TPC Deere Run knowing a birdie would win him the tournament but pushed his approach wide into a bunker, making bogey and missing the playoff won by 19-year-old Jordan Spieth. “Obviously I was disappointed and didn’t sleep much on Sunday night but that’s the great thing about professional golf,” Summerhays said. “It’s different to say an Olympian, we get to play next week and that’s the attitude I took coming here and I was fortunate enough to play really well again today. “I’m really looking forward to the rest of the week. I have to soak it in as golf won’t let you stay on top for that long,” he said.

753,WFC,RPT-ON THE MOVE-Wells Fargo adds big teams to independent channel,"July 29 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co added several veteran financial adviser teams to its independent division in recent months, including a five-adviser team from Morgan Stanley  Wealth Management in Virginia. Advisers Larry Hensle, George Fleeson, Mike Harper, Steven Skonberg, and Scott McLaughlin joined Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, or FiNet, in June, the company said Monday. FiNet is Wells Fargo’s independent broker-dealer for advisers who also function as business owners. The Reston, Virginia-based team, known as Tysons Wealth Advisors, managed a combined $529 million in client assets and produced $3.7 million in annual revenue at their previous firm. This is one of several teams that have joined FiNet from Morgan Stanley Wealth Management in recent months, Wells Fargo said Monday. In Glenview, Illinois, the brother-sister advising team of Ralph Lynch and Maureen McPeek joined FiNet from Morgan Stanley in May, Wells Fargo said. The pair managed $406 million in client assets and had $2.5 million in annual revenue production at their previous firm. Also in May, Highland, New York-based advisers Ed Burke and Jeff Altomari joined FiNet from Morgan Stanley. The pair, who make up the Hudson Valley Financial Group, managed over $165 million in client assets and had over $1 million in annual revenue production at their previous firm. A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley confirmed the departure of all these teams of advisers, but declined to comment further. FiNet has also been hiring advisers from Bank of America Corp’s Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. Alpharetta, Georgia-based advisers Scott Christian, Cecil Loyd, and Mike Masters left Merrill for FiNet in May, Wells Fargo said Monday. The team, known as Praxis Financial Partners, had $345 million in assets under management and $2.9 million in annual revenue production at their previous firm. A spokeswoman for Merrill Lynch declined to comment for this story. At the end of last year, FiNet had $68 billion in client assets and nearly 1,200 owners and advisers. Aside from FiNet, St. Louis-based Wells Fargo Advisors has a traditional broker-dealer, in which advisers are employees of the firm. This overall brokerage business includes more than 15,200 advisers who manage about $1.5 trillion in client assets, as of June 30.

755,WFC,Wells Fargo to offer credit cards that help cut consumer debt,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, is trying to grow its relatively small credit-card business with an unusual strategy: appealing to its customers’ distaste for debt. In 2007, Wells Fargo debuted the Home Rebate Card, which offers a 1 percent rebate that automatically goes toward paying down principal on a Wells Fargo home loan. In the coming months, the bank has plans to roll out cards that provide similar benefits to customers who have taken out student loans, auto loans and other types of consumer debt from the bank. “The real thing customers wanted was to pay down their mortgage,” Tom Wolfe, Wells Fargo’s executive vice president for consumer credit solutions, said in a recent interview. “That created a thought process where we asked, ‘Why don’t we offer that service for all our products?’” Wells Fargo believes offering such rewards cards is one of its best bets for boosting the credit card business at a time when consumers remain wary of taking on debt. Outstanding balances on credit cards and other types of revolving debt in the United States have remained flat over the past three years, Fed data show. Only about one-third of Wells Fargo’s customers carry the bank’s own credit cards - a relatively small number for a bank that controls roughly 10 percent of all U.S. deposits and prides itself on selling customers multiple products. It is ranked eighth among U.S. credit card issuers, with purchase volume of $66 billion in 2012, compared to $566 billion at top-ranked American Express Co and $416 billion at second-place JPMorgan Chase & Co, according to the Nilson Report. The success of Wells Fargo’s strategy remains to be seen. The bank is not the first to cater to customer frugality. Credit card companies like American Express and Discover Financial Services have long allowed customers to use reward points to pay down card balances, said Scott Valentin, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. Its reward program may also not be the best value for customers who prefer to get cash-back rewards to use as they wish, said Odysseas Papadimitrious, chief executive of Evolution Finance, the parent company of CardHub.com, and a former executive at Capital One Financial Corp. Wells Fargo declined to say how many customers have a Home Rebate Card. But it said more customers pay their balances in full each month on the Home Rebate Card than on the bank’s other cards, and fewer customers default on their loans compared to similar card products, according to Wells Fargo. The bank estimates a customer with a $150,000 home loan who spends $1,500 a month using the card could shorten their payment schedule by over one year. In May, the bank said customers had paid down $50 million in mortgage balances since the card’s 2007 launch. In adopting the strategy, Wells Fargo is counting on its ability to deepen its relationship with consumers across many different types of products. “Wells Fargo puts its claws in you,” said Tom Jalics, a senior investment analyst with Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio. “They give you a mortgage and cross-sell you on every other product they sell. They’ve really been able to differentiate themselves there.” ",8052013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-creditcards/wells-fargo-to-offer-credit-cards-that-help-cut-consumer-debt-idUSBRE97410J20130805

757,WFC,Borrowers can sue Wells Fargo over mortgage modifications,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co must face lawsuits by homeowners who claim the largest U.S. mortgage lender refused to offer them permanent mortgage modifications for which they had qualified, a federal appeals court ruled on Thursday. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Wells Fargo was required under the federal Home Affordable Modification Program to offer loan modifications to borrowers who demonstrated their eligibility during a trial period. Reversing the dismissals by a San Francisco federal judge of two lawsuits seeking class-action status, the appeals court rejected the argument that Wells Fargo became bound only upon sending borrowers signed modification agreements. The court said this would create “unfettered discretion” for the San Francisco-based bank to reject modifications “for any reason whatsoever - interest rates went up, the economy soured, (or) it just didn’t like the borrower.” While a federal appeals court in Chicago reached a similar conclusion last year, the 9th Circuit decision applies in several western U.S. states - among them California, Arizona and Nevada - that have been particularly hard-hit by foreclosures. Wells Fargo said it had $352 million of loans under HAMP in a trial modification period as of June 30. “The 9th Circuit did not rule on the merits of the underlying cases, and found only that the district court should consider the arguments put forth by the plaintiffs,” the bank said in a statement. “Wells Fargo has strong defenses to those arguments, and is prepared to present its case.” Unveiled by the Obama administration in 2009, HAMP pays mortgage lenders and servicers to rewrite loan terms for borrowers who cannot afford their payments. While steps have been taken to broaden HAMP’s reach, fewer loans than expected have been modified, and both Democrats and Republicans have complained that many borrowers who get help default on their modified mortgages. The program has also spawned other litigation, and the 9th Circuit said it “seems to have created more litigation than it has happy homeowners.” In a separate lawsuit in Massachusetts, homeowners accused Bank of America Corp of offering employees financial incentives to stall HAMP applications because foreclosures or in-house loan modifications could be more profitable. A judge is considering whether to make that case a class action. One of the Wells Fargo cases was brought by Phillip Corvello, who claimed he complied with a written trial period plan for a HAMP modification, and the other by Jeffrey and Karen Lucia, who claimed to comply with an oral plan. The Lucias’ home was sold at foreclosure in August 2010, but they kept possession of the property, Wells Fargo said. Both the unsigned majority opinion and a concurring opinion by Circuit Judge John T. Noonan faulted Wells Fargo’s drafting of the trial period plan, saying that to rule in the bank’s favor would render the benefits for borrowers illusory. “No purpose was served by the document Wells Fargo prepared except the fraudulent purpose of inducing Corvello to make the payments while the bank retained the option of modifying the loan or stiffing him,” Noonan wrote. “‘Heads I win, tails you lose’ is a fraudulent coin toss. Wells Fargo did no better.” The case is Corvello v. Wells Fargo Bank NA et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 11-16234.

The struggling electronics chain, whose shares have tanked as sales have fallen over the past year, believes it can avoid a restructuring if it can pay off current lenders, including Bank of America (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N), and secure more favorable borrowing terms from new lenders, said the sources, who declined to be named because discussions are ongoing. The process is in its early stages, and no deals have been proposed, one of them said. It is possible lenders like Wells Fargo and Bank of America could supply new loans, though third parties like GE Capital Corp GEB.N, which tends to do large asset-based lending deals, could enter the fray, the people said.

760,WFC,"Wells Fargo to cut 2,300 mortgage jobs as refinancing slows","(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the largest mortgage lender in the United States, will cut 2,300 jobs in its home loan business because fewer customers are refinancing as interest rates rise, according to an internal memo reviewed by Reuters. The cuts would represent around 3.3 percent of the bank’s consumer lending employees, the bank said. Although the bank does not disclose how many of its staff work in home loans specifically, Wells Fargo had over 11,000 mortgage loan officers on its payroll at the end of March. Mortgage refinancing made up more than 70 percent of U.S. home lending volume in the first half of 2013, but it has fallen to around 50 percent of lending and could fall further in coming months, Franklin Codel, Wells Fargo’s head of mortgage production, said in the memo. “We’ve had to recalibrate our business to meet customers’ needs, and to ensure we’re operating as efficiently and effectively as possible. Unfortunately, displacements within our team are necessary,” Codel said. The bank had expected higher lending rates to cut into its mortgage business. Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said on a July 12 conference call with analysts that rising mortgage rates would likely end the bank’s streak of seven consecutive quarters of making more than $100 billion of home loans. “We just don’t think that we are going to see $100 billion of mortgage volume, given the current rates today, in the third quarter,” Sloan said. “We will need to go ahead and make some adjustments.” At Wells Fargo there is typically a 60 to 90 day lag between refinancing volume slowing and the ability to cut mortgage production costs, according to an August 6 report from Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, which cited conversations with top Wells Fargo executives. The 2,300 employees whose positions are to be eliminated received their 60-day notice on Wednesday, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said in an email. News of the layoffs was first reported by Bloomberg News. Wells Fargo made $112 billion in mortgage loans in the second quarter, down from $131 billion from the same quarter in 2012, but up from $109 billion in the first quarter. The San Francisco-based bank extended more than one out of every five home loans in the second quarter and collected payments on nearly as many, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication. Wells Fargo executives have stressed that the bank has a diversified business model and that its fortunes are not solely determined by what happens in the mortgage market. “The mortgage horse has been a big, strong horse.

765,WFC,Wells Fargo expects to make fewer U.S. home loans this quarter,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, expects to make 30 percent fewer home loans this quarter due to rising interest rates, its financial chief said on Monday. The expected decline underscores how rising U.S. mortgage rates are cutting in to banks’ profit. Wells Fargo’s shares were down 1.2 percent at $40.94 on Monday morning. The fourth-largest U.S. bank estimates it will make $80 billion of home loans in the third quarter compared with the $112 billion it made in the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said at a conference hosted by Barclays Plc in New York. That would mark the first quarter since mid-2011 that Wells Fargo did not make at least $100 billion in home loans. Customers’ demand for refinancing their home loans has fallen 63 percent from the peak in early May, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association refinance index. As mortgage revenue declines, the bank is cutting costs in the business, a process that usually takes one to two quarters, Sloan said. On August 21, the bank announced it would lay off 2,300 employees in its mortgage unit as higher interest rates were causing refinancing activity to slow. The San Francisco-based bank made more than one of every five U.S. home loans in the second quarter and collected payments on nearly as many, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication. Wells Fargo believes its profitability is not solely tied to the mortgage lending business. The bank boosted its earnings per share in each of the previous 14 quarters, and in six of them mortgage origination revenue declined, Sloan said. Gains elsewhere at Wells Fargo could help offset the declines in mortgage income. The bank expects to release more in loss reserves than the $500 million it released in the second quarter, thanks to improved credit performance, Sloan said. Wells Fargo also added $15 billion in securities to its investment portfolio to take advantage of rising bond yields, which should boost interest income. Meanwhile, the bank is looking to boost capital levels by 1 percent after declines in the value of some of its investment securities weighed on its regulatory capital ratios, Sloan said. He did not specify how the bank was looking to increase capital levels.

766,WFC,UPDATE 1-California city backs plan to seize negative equity mortgages,"By Jim Christie RICHMOND, Calif, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Richmond, California’s leaders approved on Wednesday morning a plan for the city to become the first in the nation to acquire mortgages with negative equity in a bid to keep local residents in their homes. The power of ‘eminent domain’ allows governments to seize private property for a public purpose. Critics say the plan threatens the market for private-label mortgage-backed securities. Richmond’s city council voted 4 to 3 for Mayor Gayle McLaughlin’s proposal for city staff to work more closely with Mortgage Resolution Partners to put the plan crafted by the investor group for the city to work. Richmond can now invoke eminent domain if trusts for more than 620 delinquent and performing “underwater” mortgages reject offers made by the city to buy the loans at deep discount pegged to their properties’ current appraised prices to refinance them and reduce their principal. A mortgage is under water when its unpaid balance is greater than its property’s market value. MRP has failed to get similar plans approved by local governments elsewhere - most recently in North Las Vegas, Nevada and earlier this year in San Bernardino County in Southern California - as the mortgage industry and local real estate businesses rallied against them. But in Richmond, MRP found an ally in a Wall Street-bashing Green Party mayor of one of the San Francisco region’s poorest cities who sees working with the investor group to acquire mortgages as a public purpose if it makes the loans more affordable, averts foreclosures and alleviates blight. Richmond’s residents have been “badly harmed by this housing crisis,” McLaughlin said, defending the plan and partnership with MRP during an often contentious city council meeting that began Tuesday evening and ended early Wednesday morning. “Too many have already lost their homes.” City council members opposed to the plan countered that using eminent domain would put Richmond at risk of expensive lawsuits that could destroy the city’s finances. “A 1 percent chance of bankruptcy from this program is a deal-breaker for me,” Councilman Jim Rogers told a crowd of about 300 people at the meeting, moved to a city auditorium from the council’s chamber. Other council members warned of a backlash from financial institutions, noting Richmond had no takers last month when the successor to its redevelopment agency put $34 million of bonds up for sale to refinance previous debt. The eminent domain plan had been disclosed to the U.S. municipal bond market. While housing advocates urged support for the plan, realtor Jeffrey Wright warned that going through with eminent domain could prompt a clampdown in mortgage lending in Richmond or push up mortgage interest rates in the city of about 104,000 residents. Responding to the plan, the Federal Housing Finance Agency recently said it would press Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to limit or cease its business where such proposals get approved, effectively closing off most mortgage financing there. Investors holding the mortgages targeted by Richmond dispute altruism motivates the plan and charge the city would lend its eminent domain power to San Francisco-based MRP to split profits from refinancings. The investors have sued through trustees Wells Fargo & Co and Deutsche Bank AG in U.S. District Court to block the plan, which they say relies on them swallowing losses. The two sides square off in court in person for the first time on Thursday. McLaughlin’s proposal directs city staff to work with other local governments interested in the plan, calls for city staff and MRP to resolve its legal issues and confirms the city council would hold votes to seize mortgages by eminent domain if necessary. That would require a supermajority vote of the council.",9112013,http://www.reuters.com/article/richmond-eminentdomain/update-1-california-city-backs-plan-to-seize-negative-equity-mortgages-idUSL2N0H70HW20130911
767,WFC,U.S. banks to get 3rd-qtr profit boost from dipping into reserves,"* JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo expected to release reserves * Funds could offset lower mortgage revenue, higher legal costs * Some analysts question “quality” of earnings By Peter Rudegeair and Carrick Mollenkamp Sept 13 (Reuters) - Top U.S. banks will get billions of dollars of extra profit this quarter from the money they set aside in tougher times to cover bad loans. Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co and Bank of America Corp said this week that more borrowers are paying their loans on time, which allows the lenders to keep less money on hand to cover loan losses. Dipping into the money they had previously set aside - known as “releasing reserves” - is entirely legal, and banks have been doing it for some time. But it will be particularly handy for banks this quarter. Mortgage lending has slowed down, cutting into a key source of income growth for the banks. Meanwhile, overall loan growth has been tepid, Federal Reserve data shows, signaling that there are few obvious sorts of income growth to replace mortgages, and litigation costs for many banks are rising. “We are in a better quality environment that still is not a growth environment,” said Nancy Bush, an analyst at NAB Research in Annandale, New Jersey. JPMorgan is expected to release around $1.5 billion in the third quarter from areas including credit card loans and mortgages, finance chief Marianne Lake said this week at a conference hosted by Barclays Capital. These reserve releases will allow the bank to set aside more money to cover litigation expenses, Lake said. Wells Fargo expects to release more reserves in the third quarter than the $500 million in released in the second, Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said at the conference. He did not provide a specific number, and a spokeswoman for the San Francisco company declined to comment further. Bank of America finance chief Bruce Thompson did not provide an estimate of the bank’s expected reserve releases when he spoke this week, but he did say that much of its worst loans have been written off, and he said in July that he expects “continued reserve releases, particularly in its consumer real estate portfolios.” Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London, estimated in a report on Thursday that the bank could release $1.6 billion in the third quarter. He added that the Charlotte, North Carolina, bank could reduce its $22 billion loan loss reserves by 27 percent and still have enough to cover double the amount of expected net loan losses. Citigroup Inc, the third-largest U.S. bank, has not given any guidance about reserve releases, but research firm Portales Partners estimates that the 16 major banks it follows have $14.7 billion of reserves that could be funneled into earnings. A third of that is in residential real estate portfolios, and another third is in commercial real estate, said Portales research director Jennifer Thompson. The rest is in areas including corporate loans and auto loans. Banks do not have carte blanche to release reserves. They have to point out that credit has improved enough such that those reserves are no longer necessary. The reserve releases boost pretax income, and regulators watch them closely to make sure banks are not manipulating earnings. Because the releases are not necessarily repeatable in the future, some analysts are suspicious of them. “It’s not quality earnings,” said Charles Peabody of Portales. Executives at JPMorgan, Wells, and Bank of America highlighted the strong performance of their loan books when discussing their reserve releases. JPMorgan’s credit card loans are experiencing “20-year lows for delinquencies across the industry,” CFO Lake said at the conference. Loans are also performing better because banks tightened their underwriting standards after the financial crisis. The mortgage loans Wells Fargo extended after 2008 “have virtually no losses,” CFO Sloan said. Reserve releases were an important contributor to banks’ strong second-quarter results. They accounted for 14 percent of JPMorgan’s second-quarter earnings, 6 percent of Wells Fargo’s and 16 percent of Bank of America’s, according to a September report from Bernstein Research. However, reserve releases can offset lower revenue for only so long before banks have to find ways to make up the difference, NAB’s Bush said. “The industry is in this transition period, but transitioning into what? You hope it’s into better growth, better margins, and all the stuff that goes into that, but it doesn’t feel that way yet.” JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America will report third-quarter earnings in mid-October.",9132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-banks-profit/u-s-banks-to-get-3rd-qtr-profit-boost-from-dipping-into-reserves-idUSL2N0H91JJ20130913

Adorean Boleancu admitted to writing the checks without authorization on the client’s brokerage account and home equity lines of credit, and making payments to family members, a girlfriend and to companies where he had credit card accounts, U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag in San Francisco said on Tuesday. A lawyer for Boleancu previously identified the client as Donna Treadwell, who according to court papers was 77 when she first met the defendant. Prosecutors said Boleancu established the accounts for Treadwell in 2007 while he worked at Morgan Stanley, left that firm a year later, and continued to forge checks on her accounts through 2011, when he worked at Wells Fargo. Boleancu, 47, lives in Napa, California. He entered his plea on Friday, after having been indicted in July on 27 counts, court records show. The defendant remains free on $800,000 bond pending a Dec. 17 sentencing hearing before U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco. He faces a maximum of 30 years in prison. A copy of Boleancu’s plea agreement was not immediately available. Ethan Balogh, a lawyer for Boleancu, did not immediately respond on Tuesday to a request for comment. Neither Wells Fargo nor Morgan Stanley was accused of wrongdoing. In March, Boleancu agreed to repay Treadwell $650,000 and be banned from the securities industry as part of a civil settlement with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

The fourth-largest U.S. bank provided a 60-day notice on Wednesday to employees whose jobs were to be eliminated, the bank said in a statement. Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan told investors at a conference on September 9 that the San Francisco bank had laid off 3,000 employees in its mortgage business so far in the third quarter. Sloan also said Wells Fargo expected to make $80 billion in home loans in the third quarter, nearly 30 percent below its second-quarter figure. As mortgage revenue declines, the bank is looking to trim expenses in the unit, a process that usually takes one to two quarters, Sloan said. News of the planned layoffs was first reported by Bloomberg News on Wednesday. Wells Fargo made more than one of every five U.S. home loans in the second quarter, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication. Wells Fargo shares were down 0.7 percent at $43.02 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday morning.

774,WFC,Wells Fargo fails to end U.S. mortgage fraud lawsuit,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge has rejected Wells Fargo & Co’s bid to dismiss a U.S. government lawsuit accusing the nation’s largest mortgage lender of fraud, a victory for federal investigators pursuing cases tied to the recent housing and financial crises. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said on Tuesday that the government may pursue its key federal claims that Wells Fargo lied about the quality of mortgages it submitted to a government insurance program, costing hundreds of millions of dollars over roughly a decade. In particular, Furman sided with the U.S. Department of Justice’s interpretation of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, a law adopted after the 1980s savings-and-loan crisis that lets the government sue for fraud affecting a federally-insured financial institution. Wells Fargo said the FIRREA claim should be tossed because the only institution affected by its conduct was itself. But Furman concluded otherwise, following the lead of two colleagues on the Manhattan federal court, Jed Rakoff and Lewis Kaplan, in cases against Bank of America Corp and Bank of New York Mellon Corp, respectively “The question considered by the courts in these cases was whether a financial institution, through its own misconduct, can affect itself within the meaning of FIRREA,” Furman wrote in a 60-page decision. “Courts have repeatedly held that it can. There is no reason to deviate from that interpretation here.” Furman also dismissed some claims against San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, which is also the fourth-largest U.S. bank, including claims of negligence and unjust enrichment. He said this was because the government brought them too late, or had been aware of Wells Fargo’s misconduct at the time they arose. The October 2012 lawsuit accused Wells Fargo of misleading the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development into believing its loans qualified for insurance from HUD’s Federal Housing Administration. As in many of the government’s major financial crisis-era cases, no individuals were named as defendants. The Justice Department is also seeking civil penalties as well as damages. “We are disappointed with the court’s ruling, but we look forward to presenting facts to vigorously defend against this action,” Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said. “Wells Fargo denies the allegations and believes it acted in good faith and in compliance with Federal Housing Administration and Department of Housing and Urban Development rules.” In afternoon trading, the bank’s shares were down 51 cents at $41.80 on the New York Stock Exchange. The lawsuit is one of several filed by the government seeking to hold financial companies liable under FIRREA, the federal False Claims Act, or both for shoddy mortgage loans that helped fuel the U.S. housing and financial crises. FIRREA has become a favorite tool to address alleged mortgage fraud because of its 10-year statute of limitations, twice the length than allowed under other federal securities laws. The lawsuit against Wells Fargo alleges that the FHA paid hundreds of millions of dollars on insurance claims on thousands of defaulted mortgages as a result of false certifications by Wells Fargo. The bank was sued under both FIRREA and the False Claims Act. According to the government, Wells certified more than 100,000 loans for FHA insurance despite knowing that borrowers’ ability to make payments had not been properly vetted. The government also said that from 2002 to 2010, Wells Fargo identified 6,558 loans as having materially violated HUD requirements, but reported only 238 of them. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, at the time he brought the case, faulted Wells Fargo’s alleged “longstanding and reckless trifecta of deficient training, deficient underwriting and deficient disclosure, all while relying on the convenient backstop of government insurance.” Furman rejected Wells Fargo’s argument that it need not face the lawsuit because it had joined a $25 billion federal settlement in April 2012 with several banks over alleged foreclosure abuses. The judge supervising that accord, U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer in Washington, D.C., in February rejected a similar claim by the bank. Trial began on Tuesday in the Bank of America case before Judge Rakoff. There, the government accuses the second-largest U.S. bank of violating FIRREA through the fraudulent sale of risky loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 2012, the government settled False Claims Act mortgage cases for $1 billion with Bank of America, $202.3 million with Deutsche Bank AG, $158.3 million with Citigroup Inc and $132.8 million with Flagstar Bancorp Inc.

U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan on Tuesday said the U.S. Department of Justice might pursue all its federal statutory claims against Wells Fargo, which is also the fourth-largest U.S. bank.

777,WFC,Wells Fargo to pay Freddie Mac $780 mln to settle mortgage claims,"Sept 30 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Monday it will pay $780 million in cash to Freddie Mac to resolve substantially all repurchase liabilities on home loans sold to the government-controlled mortgage company prior to 2009. The largest U.S. mortgage lender said the settlement was reached on Sept. 27 and totaled $869 million before adjusting for credits related to prior loan repurchases. Wells Fargo announced the settlement five days after Citigroup Inc agreed to pay Freddie Mac $395 million to settle similar claims over roughly 3.7 million mortgages sold from 2000 to 2012. Citigroup is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, while Wells Fargo ranks fourth. Wells Fargo said the cost of its agreement is covered by existing reserves. On Aug. 7, the San Francisco-based lender estimated a probable $2.2 billion loss over claims it breached representations and warranties in the sale of mortgage loans. It is unclear how much of the latest settlement related to Wachovia Corp, which Wells Fargo bought at the end of 2008. Freddie Mac and larger rival Fannie Mae, which both received federal bailouts in 2008, have pushed banks to buy back mortgages that soured during the nation’s housing downturn. Banks can be forced to buy back loans if the representations and warranties over how well the loans were underwritten, and whether borrowers could afford them, prove false. Citigroup agreed in July to pay $968 million to settle repurchase claims by Fannie Mae, while Bank of America Corp  agreed in January to pay $3.6 billion. Freddie Mac did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wells Fargo declined to comment, citing a “quiet period” ahead of its Oct. 11 release of third-quarter results.",9302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/wellsfargo-freddiemac-mortgage-settlemen/wells-fargo-to-pay-freddie-mac-780-mln-to-settle-mortgage-claims-idUSL2N0HL27C20130930
778,WFC,"Bank of America, Wells Fargo to improve mortgage servicing plans","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bank of America and Wells Fargo once again agreed to improve their mortgage servicing processes, after state and federal authorities said the banks were still not properly handling requests from struggling borrowers. In commitments made public on Wednesday, the two banks pledged to improve communications with borrowers seeking to modify their loans, after authorities found that last year’s $25 billion deal did not correct certain problems. One state - New York - said Wells Fargo did not go far enough in its commitments, and accused the bank in federal court on Wednesday of breaching the terms of the earlier deal. That earlier deal - between the U.S. Justice Department, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and 49 states - was designed to end mortgage servicing abuses. But authorities found that problems have continued. Banks were required to provide homeowners with a single representative who would review their loan files and manage the process of seeking a modification, for example. Instead, those representatives often changed and sometimes did not have the competence or capacity to solve problems, the monitor of the settlement, Joe Smith, said in an interview on Wednesday. Borrowers also continued to face problems with not knowing if an application to modify a loan was complete - a crucial characterization that would stop a foreclosure proceeding, Smith said. In the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, millions of homeowners, many of whom owed more than their house were worth after home prices plummeted, struggled to avoid foreclosure through receiving a modification of their loan. But many of those efforts stalled as homeowners complained of servicers repeatedly losing paperwork, providing confusing requirements, and generally being unresponsive. To address lingering concerns, the two largest mortgage servicers agreed on Wednesday to improve communications with customers about missing information, provide an escalation process for customers who were repeatedly asked for information, and establish a direct contact for housing counselors advocating for the borrowers, among other changes. “As part of our commitment to assist borrowers struggling to meet their mortgage payments, Bank of America is continuing to invest resources to refine its loss mitigation practices and procedures,” the bank said in a letter outlining its changes. In court documents, New York’s attorney general outlined problems faced by 97 New Yorkers whose loans were serviced by Wells Fargo that the state said showed the bank had not complied with last year’s settlement. In a statement, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Vickee Adams said the bank had taken voluntary steps to put in place the customer service changes that would have been in a formal agreement with New York. Also on Wednesday, monitor Joe Smith announced four new benchmarks that all of the banks from the settlement - Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and ResCap - are required to meet. One requires the banks to evaluate and remediate the performance of the representatives who serve as the contacts for struggling borrowers. Another tests whether monthly statements sent to borrowers accurately reflect what a borrower has paid and owes.

780,WFC,"UPDATE 1-NY to sue Wells Fargo, strike deal with Bank of America over mortgages-sources","By Karen Freifeld WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The New York Attorney General plans to sue Wells Fargo & Co  on Wednesday over failures to comply with the terms of the $26 billion national mortgage settlement, according to a person familiar with matter. At the same time, Bank of America Corp confirmed it had separately struck an agreement with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman over similar types of alleged compliance problems. Separately, a committee of 14 other states and federal authorities monitoring the settlement are expected to announce agreements with both Bank of America and Wells Fargo to address similar compliance concerns over loan modifications and other issues, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Those agreements seek to address complaints from borrowers that banks had not met the terms of the national settlement. Vickee Adams, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, said the bank had not been served a copy of the lawsuit. She added that the bank believed a “collaborative approach - not protracted litigation or continued threats - offers the best path toward continuing to improve services to borrowers.” Dan Frahm, a spokesman for Bank of America, said: “We’re pleased to resolve without litigation the matters brought forward by the New York Attorney General related to loan modifications and other assistance mortgage servicers provide.” He added that the agreement would require the bank to bolster its interactions with the New York Attorney General and home owner advocates. The two pending actions by Schneiderman come several months after he said he had evidence to suggest the banks had violated the terms of the settlement, which is designed to end mortgage services abuses. Last year, the country’s top banks agreed to provide $26 billion in fines and relief to struggling homeowners. Schneiderman has claimed his office has documented hundreds of potential violations over the timely processing of mortgage modification applications.",10022013,http://www.reuters.com/article/mortgage-settlement-enforcement/update-1-ny-to-sue-wells-fargo-strike-deal-with-bank-of-america-over-mortgages-sources-idUSL1N0HS01D20131002
781,WFC,"Fitch Affirms Wells Fargo's Ratings Following Large Regional Peer Review, Outlook Stable","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has completed a peer review of the  following 14 rated large regional banks : BB&T; Corporation (BBT), Capital One  Finance Corporation (COF), Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp  (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T; Bank Corporation  (MTB), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF),  SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), UnionBanCal Corporation (UBC),  Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION). Refer to the  release titled 'Fitch Takes Rating Actions on Its Large Regional Bank Group  Following Peer Review' for a discussion of rating actions taken on the other  large regionals banks. RATING ACTION AND RATIONALE Wells Fargo & Company's (WFC) ratings were affirmed reflecting the company's  superior earning profile, strong franchise, solid capital and liquidity  profiles, and improving asset quality. WFC's financial performance over the past  several years has been very solid despite a challenging economic and interest  rate environment. WFC continues to post very strong net income each quarter,  with return on assets (ROAs) well in excess of the large regional average. WFC  boasts leading market shares in many areas, including mortgage originations,  servicing, commercial real estate, small business lending, deposits, automobile  lending, and private student lending.  WFC's credit risk metrics have improved along with those in the industry,  nonetheless nonperforming assets (NPA) ratios remain elevated and above regional  bank peer averages. Much of the weaker relative performance is due to a large  balance of mortgage-related accruing troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) and  below-average credit quality on residential mortgage and home equity. TDRs are  high and are expected to remain elevated; however, Fitch views WFC's strong  earnings capacity as an adequate risk mitigant. Fitch believes that WFC is appropriately capitalized, particularly given its  solid funding and earnings profiles, to manage through continued economic  challenges ahead.  As a result of the revised treatment of MSRs and the  inclusion of other comprehensive income (OCI) under Basel III, Fitch expects WFC  to maintain an appropriate capital buffer to withstand the related volatility in  capital ratios.   WFC is primarily deposit funded, with core deposits representing 78% of total  funding sources as of June 30, 2013. The parent's liquidity profile is  considered solid, though could be impacted given the outcome of Orderly  Liquidity Authority (OLA)-related proposed long-term debt requirements.  RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - VRs and IDRs:  Given that WFC's ratings are already at the top of the global rated bank  universe, Fitch views limited potential for a ratings upgrade. Conversely,  failure to maintain earnings at current levels will pressure WFC's ratings. The  strength of the earnings stream provides for solid capital generation  capabilities, which will help absorb unexpected losses.  Similar to most large banks in the industry, WFC's balance sheet is positioned  for rising rates. However, the company is somewhat unique in its relatively  large mortgage operations, which somewhat mute the asset sensitive balance  sheet. WFC could be vulnerable if there is a rapid increase in interest rates,  as mortgage activity could conceivably slow down faster than assets reprice.  However, this potential earnings sensitivity is more pronounced during periods  of high refinance activity. Fitch notes some expansion recently of the wholesale banking business segment,  as WFC builds out its international presence and capital markets offerings.  Fitch expects any expansion by WFC internationally or in investment banking to  remain a primarily customer-focused strategy, and outside of that, both are  expected to remain relatively small in terms of total business mix. If WFC were  to increase its investment banking business to a size in line with other large  trading banks, there would likely be negative rating implications, although  Fitch views this as unlikely over the near term.   Fitch also notes that WFC's ratings and Stable Outlook incorporate a view that  WFC will be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny given its size, though  that it will be able to comply without materially impacting its earnings or  balance sheet.  RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - Support Ratings and Support Floor Ratings: WFC's Support Rating (SR) of '1' and Support Floor Rating (SRF) of 'A' reflect  its systemic importance to the U.S. The SR and SRF are sensitive to a change in  Fitch's assumptions about the ongoing availability of extraordinary sovereign  support. On Sept. 11, 2013, Fitch outlined its approach to incorporating support  in its bank ratings in light of evolving support dynamics for banks worldwide.  Refer to the reports titled 'Bank Support: Likely Rating Paths' and 'The  Evolving Dynamics of Support for Banks' for additional details. That said, WFC's  IDR of 'AA-' does not currently incorporate any government support, and reflects  it standalone strength only. As such, any change to WFC's SR or SRF will have no  impact to the company's IDR, absent a downgrade in the company's standalone  profile.   RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - Subordinated Debt and Other Hybrid  Securities: Subordinated debt and hybrid capital instruments issued by the banks are notched  down from the issuers' Viability Ratings (VRs) in accordance with Fitch's  assessment of each instrument's respective non-performance and relative loss  severity risk profiles, which vary considerably. The ratings of subordinated  debt and hybrid securities are sensitive to any change in the banks' VRs or to  changes in the banks' propensity to make coupon payments that are permitted but  not compulsory under the instruments' documentation. RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - Holding Company: All of the entities reviewed in the Large Regional Bank Group have a bank  holding company (BHCs) structure with the bank as the main subsidiary. All  subsidiaries are considered core to parent holding company supporting equalized  ratings between bank subsidiaries and bank holding companies. IDRs and VRs are  equalized with those of its operating companies and banks reflecting its role as  the bank holding company. Double leverage is right at or below 120% for all the  parent companies reviewed in this peer group.  RATING DRIVERS AND SENSITIVITIES - Subsidiary and Affiliated Company Rating: WFC's subsidiaries factor in a high probability of support from parent  institutions to its subsidiaries. This reflects the fact that performing parent  banks have very rarely allowed subsidiaries to default. It also considers the  high level of integration, brand, management, financial and reputational  incentives to avoid subsidiary defaults.

782,WFC,"Fitch: Wells Fargo 3Q'13 Results: Mortgage Revenues Decline As Expected, Net Income Still Strong","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 11 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) reported a still strong  quarter with earnings growth for 15 quarters in a row, despite a significant  drop in mortgage revenues. Offsetting the expected decline in refinancing  activities, provision expenses dropped to just $75 million, helping to support a  still strong return on average assets (ROA) of 1.53%.  As expected, mortgage banking revenues declined during the quarter given the  recent rise in long-term interest rates. Revenues were impacted by both lower  refinance volumes and reduced gain on sale margins. WFC's first mortgage  unclosed pipeline fell to just $35 billion, well below the level last quarter  and a year ago. As such, Fitch expects that mortgage revenues will likely  continue to decline over the near term. Revenues fell 4% sequentially driven by the previously mentioned decline in  mortgage revenues, though excluding mortgage from both quarters, noninterest  income improved 4% on a sequential basis. WFC also reported lower trust and  investment fees, offset by a significant increase in gains from equity  investments, which tend to be a lumpy item for the company. Equity gains during  the first nine months of 2013 are up just $48 million as compared to the same  period last year. Spread income was flat, though the net interest margin once  again declined on a sequential basis due to the continued growth in deposits  which is dilutive to the margin. Expenses fell 1% sequentially due to lower  incentive compensation, somewhat offset by higher mortgage-related severance  expenses.  Provision expenses totaled just 4bps of loans on an annualized basis, as  compared to quarterly NCOs at 48bps of average loans. As a result of the reserve  release for the quarter, reserves for loan losses declined to 1.87% of loans.  The improved housing market and improving asset quality performance drove the  higher sequential reserve release. WFC expects future reserve releases, absent a  significant deterioration in economic conditions. Fitch notes that NCOs at this  level are also likely not sustainable, with historical losses more around the  100bps range.  As previously disclosed, WFC had reached an agreement with Freddie Mac to  resolve substantially all repurchase liabilities related to loans sold to  Freddie Mac prior to Jan. 1, 2009. The one-time cash payment of approximately  $780m was covered by existing reserves, and as such was neutral to earnings.  Fitch views the agreement favorably as it resolves the majority of  mortgage-related repurchase risk for WFC, in Fitch's view. The ending balance of  reserves totaled $1.42 billion or 109% of the original loan balance of  unresolved repurchase demands. Tier 1 common under Basel III improved approximately 100bps to an estimated  9.54% at Sept. 30, 2013, and exceeded the company's internal target of 9%. WFC  attributed the improvement to improved risk weightings on BOLI assets, the  disposition of an asset with punitive risk-weighting, and model refinements for  commercial portfolios. Unlike last quarter, the movement in unrealized  securities gains did not materially impact capital ratios with unrealized gains  actually improving to $5.8 billion at Sept. 30, 2013 from $5.1 billion at June  30, 2013, but still well below the $11.2 billion at March 31, 2013, prior to  recent rise in long-term interest rates. As an Advanced Approach bank, WFC will  be subject to fluctuations in AOCI under Basel III once it comes into effect  Jan. 1, 2014. WFC's ratings were affirmed on October 8, 2013 reflecting the company's superior  earning profile, strong franchise, solid capital and liquidity profiles, and  improving asset quality. WFC's financial performance over the past several years  has been very solid despite a challenging economic and interest rate  environment. WFC continues to post very strong net income each quarter, with  return on assets (ROAs) well in excess of the large regional average.

783,WFC,Wells Fargo profit rises but investors worry about growth,"(Reuters) - Profit at Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) rose by a better-than-expected 13 percent in the third quarter, as the largest U.S. mortgage lender made up for a decline in that business by releasing a large chunk of money set aside for bad loans. Home refinancings, which had been a profit center over the past few quarters for the No. 4 U.S. bank, slowed as anticipated, and many of its 89 other businesses did not improve enough to make up the difference. Both interest and fee income fell slightly from year-earlier levels. An improving economy meant more people paid their bills and the bank was able to release $900 million of reserves for credit losses, its largest since the second quarter of 2011. But some investors worried whether Wells Fargo can overcome the slowdown in mortgage activity after the release of reserves runs its course. “At some point, the reserve releases drop away, mortgage becomes a very bland business, and growth has to happen” from other parts of the bank, said Chris Richey, portfolio manager and managing director at Neosho Capital, a $165 million investment firm that holds Wells Fargo shares. “They’ve got their work cut out for them,” Richey said. Wells Fargo executives believe that despite the drop-off in mortgage activity, underlying economic trends will enable most of their businesses to grow. “The improvement in housing is really good for America, good for our customers and ultimately good for our company,” Chief Executive John Stumpf said on a conference call with analysts. He said household debt levels were at their lowest since 2002, “which provides capacity for consumer spending and borrowing going forward.” Wells Fargo stock dipped 0.6 percent to $41.18, recouping most of its losses from earlier in the session. Separately on Friday, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) posted its first quarterly loss under Chief Executive Jamie Dimon after a tangle of legal and regulatory probes cost the biggest U.S. bank $7.2 billion. Wells Fargo’s net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $5.32 billion, or 99 cents per share, from $4.72 billion, or 88 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, estimated Wells Fargo would earn 97 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue dipped to $20.5 billion from $21.2 billion a year earlier. Mortgage banking income fell 43 percent to $1.61 billion due to fewer loans as well as diminished profit from selling mortgages to investors. Wells Fargo’s mortgage business is in a “transitional period,” Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan told analysts on the conference call, adding that mortgage volumes in the fourth quarter were likely to be lower. The San Francisco bank made $80 billion in home loans, down from $139 billion a year earlier and ending a streak of seven consecutive quarters making over $100 billion in home loans. Rising interest rates crimped customer demand for mortgages throughout the quarter. In early September, applications to refinance home loans fell to their lowest level since November 2008. For the week ended September 27, 30-year mortgage rates fell to 4.49 percent from 4.8 percent in the week ended August 23, after the U.S. Federal Reserve opted not to curtail its bond-buying program on September 18, but there was little sign that Wells Fargo would immediately benefit. The bank had $35 billion in mortgage applications that it had received but not yet processed at quarter-end, compared with $63 billion at the end of the second quarter. Higher revenues from other businesses helped to pick up some of the slack from mortgage banking. Trust and investment fees rose to $3.28 billion from $2.95 billion a year earlier. Investment banking fees jumped 33 percent from the same period a year earlier. The bank also increased its loan book by 1.3 percent to $812.3 billion from the second quarter. The increase was broad-based, with nearly $5 billion coming from growth in commercial, auto and credit card loans, and $5.2 billion from acquisitions of commercial real estate loans from European banks. Wells Fargo’s net interest margin, a measure of how profitable its loans are, fell to 3.38 percent from 3.66 percent in the same quarter last year. “Cosmetically, the quarter looked weaker,” given the share of the bank’s profit connected to reserve releases, said Marty Mosby, an equity analyst at investment bank Guggenheim Securities. “It’s one of those transition quarters. As you move into the next quarter or two, you’ll see temporary earnings being replaced” with more stable sources, Mosby said.

784,WFC,Analysis: Wells wealth sector goosed by asset-based fees; commissions fall,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fees drove a 33 percent rise in profits at Wells Fargo Corp’s (WFC.N) brokerage and wealth management businesses in the third quarter from the same quarter a year ago, underscoring the continued transition of brokers from transaction-based salespeople to fee-compensated asset gatherers. Profit at the bank company as a whole rose by a better-than-expected 13 percent in the third quarter, as it made up for a decline in its industry-leading mortgage business by releasing a large chunk of money set aside for bad loans. Wells’s retail sector drew down $10 million from its reserves for bad loans. Net income in the bank’s “Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement” sector rose $112 million from a year ago to $450 million while revenue jumped by $274 million, or 9.0 percent, to $3.3 billion. Driving the lift was “strong growth in asset-based fees and higher net interest income, partly offset by decreased brokerage transaction revenue,” Wells said in a news release. It did not break out specific fee and commission revenue, but said client assets gathered by its retail brokers jumped 8 percent from a year ago and three percent from this year’s second quarter to $1.3 trillion. Commissions paid to brokers fell from this year’s second quarter, it said. Like many big wealth management companies, Wells has been pushing advisers to sell so-called “plan-based solutions” incorporating fee-based financial planning services and managed money accounts. Managed account assets among advisers in its brokerage businesses grew 18 percent from a year ago to $350 million, while all client assets for the brokers were up 8 percent to $1.3 trillion. The number of brokers at Wells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. bank and the third largest brokerage firm, remained virtually flat at 15,285 as of September 30. That was up 1.0 percent from a year ago. Across the three wealth businesses - private banking, brokerage and retirement services - assets rose 7.0 percent from a year ago and 3.0 percent from the second quarter to $1.5 trillion. Individual and institutional retirement account assets showed the biggest asset gains, up 10 percent and 11 percent to $326 billion and $288 billion respectively. Wells’s wealth, brokerage and retirement sector remains a small part of the fourth largest U.S. bank’s businesses. The sector’s net income of $450 million last quarter compares to $3.34 billion from the fourth largest U.S. bank’s retail branch and business banking sector and $1.97 billion from its wholesale, or corporate and investment banking, sector. However, the wealth sector led the three in cross-selling products to its customers, another big push of commercial banks. Clients in the wealth sector averaged 10.4 bank products per household, up from 10.3 a year earlier. That compares with 6.15 products among branch banking households and 7.0 among Wells’s wholesale banking clients.

785,WFC,US STOCKS-Wall Street edges up with eyes on Washington,"* JP Morgan, Wells Fargo post earnings * Washington political talks continue to end crisis * UMich falls to weakest level in nine months * Indexes up: Dow 0.33 pct, S&P; 0.17 pct, Nasdaq up 0.18 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on Friday, following the biggest rally since the first trading day of the year, as talks continued in Washington to end a fiscal stalemate that has shut down the government for days. President Barack Obama will press his case for a quick reopening of the entire federal government, coupled with an emergency increase of U.S. borrowing authority, when he meets with Senate Republicans on Friday. The partial government shutdown is now in its eleventh day and less than a week remains before an Oct. 17 deadline to extend the government’s borrowing authority and avoid a debt default. The crisis in Washington threatens to damage the fiscal standing of the United States and to derail its fragile economic recovery. “There seems to be some flexibility now, at least the talks are progressing,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York “Once sanity returns, at least temporarily, to Washington the market really should move higher.” Major U.S. stock indexes staged their strongest rally in more than nine months on Thursday, leaving the S&P; 500  less than 2 percent away from its record closing high set three weeks ago. The S&P; financial index slipped 0.1 percent after earnings reports from JP Morgan Chase & Co, which was up 0.6 percent at $52.84, and Wells Fargo & Co, which fell 1.6 percent to $40.76. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets reported a rare quarterly loss after incurring $9.2 billion in legal expenses. Excluding litigation expense and reserve release, it earned a profit of $5.82 billion, or $1.42 a share. Wells Fargo & Co, the biggest U.S. mortgage lender reported a 13 percent rise in third-quarter profit, but its mortgage banking income fell sharply as the refinancing boom began to fade. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 49.84 points, or 0.33 percent, to 15,175.91, the S&P; 500 gained 2.84 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,695.4 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 6.728 points, or 0.18 percent, to 3,767.475. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers’ preliminary October consumer sentiment index fell to 75.2, its weakest level in nine months, from the final September figure of 77.5, and below expectations of a 76 reading. Micron Technology Inc fell 3 percent to $17.88 after the chipmaker reported a smaller-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Thursday.

An improving economy meant more people paid their bills and the bank was able to release $900 million of reserves for credit losses, its largest since the second quarter of 2011. Lower write-offs of bad loans and lower personnel expenses also boosted profits, it said on Friday. Net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $5.32 billion, or 99 cents per share, from $4.72 billion, or 88 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, estimated Wells Fargo would earn 97 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wells Fargo shares were down 1.3 percent at $40.89 in early trading. The bank made $80 billion in home loans, down from $139 billion a year earlier. That marked the smallest amount of mortgages that Wells Fargo extended since the second quarter of 2011, when it made $64 billion. It also ended a streak of seven consecutive quarters making over $100 billion in home loans. Mortgage banking income fell 43 percent to $1.61 billion due to fewer loans as well as diminished profit from selling mortgages to investors. Within the business, income from collecting payments on mortgages rose by over $300 million to $507 million, while income from the business of making new loans fell by $1.5 billion to $1.1 billion. The profitability of selling mortgages fell to 1.42 percent from 2.21 percent in both the third quarter of 2012 and the second quarter of 2013. The bank had expected the margin to fall to about 1.5 percent. Rising interest rates crimped customer demand for mortgages throughout the quarter. In early September, applications to refinance home loans fell to their lowest level since November 2008. For the week ended Sept. 27, 30-year mortgage rates fell to 4.49 percent from 4.8 percent in the week ended Aug. 23, after the U.S. Federal Reserve opted not to curtail its bond-buying program on Sept. 18, but there was little sign that Wells Fargo would immediately benefit.

Wells Fargo’s net interest margin, a measure of how profitable its loans are, fell to 3.38 percent from 3.66 percent in the same quarter last year and 3.46 percent in the second quarter. An increase in deposits and long-term debt was responsible for 75 percent of the decrease from the prior quarter. Total revenue dipped to $20.5 billion from $21.2 billion a year earlier, meaning that the higher profits were achieved though cost savings and reserve releases. The bank announced layoffs of about 5,300 employees in its mortgage operation throughout the third quarter. Earlier Friday, JPMorgan Chase & Co posted its first quarterly loss under Chief Executive Jamie Dimon after a tangle of legal and regulatory probes cost the biggest U.S. bank $7.2 billion.

Under the deal, the seller, Beacon Capital Partners LLC, will retain the remaining stake in the 2 million square-foot (187,100 square-meter) building at 1211 Avenue of the Americas, the company said. The deal values the 45-story skyscraper between 47th and 48th Streets at $1.75 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter. The building is adjacent to Rockefeller Center, an area where the availability rate - the space that is expected to be vacant within the next 12 months - has grown to 12.6 percent in the third quarter from 10.4 percent a year earlier, according to real estate services company CBRE Group Inc . That is slightly higher than the 12.2 percent third quarter overall midtown Manhattan availability rate. Eastdil Secured, a unit of Wells Fargo & Co, handled the deal. Ivanhoé Cambridge was an early mover in acquiring commercial real estate right after the credit crisis.

791,WFC,Wells Fargo waives October mortgage fees for late payers,"NEW YORK (Reuters)p - If you are late on your mortgage payment to Wells Fargo Corp (WFC.N) this month, the bank is giving you a break. Wells, the largest home mortgage lender in the United States, will not assess late fees on borrowers who missed their payment deadlines in deference to the 16-day government shutdown from October 1 to October 16, a bank spokesman said Thursday. Wells has not formally announced the waiver. The spokesman declined to say how much it collects in late charges in an average month. The San Francisco-based company processes the paperwork on about 12 million loans, and assesses late fees according to the size of the loan and its interest rate. A typical late charge on a $200,000 20-year mortgage with a 3.3 percent interest rate would be about $24, according to one statement reviewed by Reuters. An array of banks and credit unions had announced when Congress failed to agree on funding the government at the end of September that they would offer low- or no-rate temporary loans to government workers affected by the shutdown. They also said they would consider “forbearance” on credit card loans and other payments, but the issue faded in importance when Congress decided after two weeks to approve temporary funding. Some large banks that ran into credit problems during the financial crisis consulted with regulators to get permission for the programs. The Wells spokesman said it was not required to do so. Wells dominates the U.S. mortgage landscape, although its lending and servicing portfolios are getting smaller. The bank made $80 billion in home loans last quarter, down from $139 billion a year earlier as mortgage refinancings fell because of rising long-term interest rates. The bank said on October 17 that it is cutting 925 mortgage jobs as a result of slower activity. Bank of America Corp.

792,WFC,Wells Fargo waives October mortgage fees for late payers,"NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters)p - If you are late on your mortgage payment to Wells Fargo Corp this month, the bank is giving you a break. Wells, the largest home mortgage lender in the United States, will not assess late fees on borrowers who missed their payment deadlines in deference to  the 16-day government shutdown from  Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, a bank spokesman said Thursday. Wells has not formally announced the waiver. The spokesman declined to say how much it collects in late charges in an average month. The San Francisco-based company processes the paperwork on about 12 million loans, and assesses late fees according to the size of the loan and its interest rate. A typical late charge on a $200,000 20-year mortgage with a 3.3 percent interest rate would be about $24, according to one statement reviewed by Reuters. An array of banks and credit unions had announced when Congress failed to agree on funding the government at the end of September that they would offer low- or no-rate temporary loans to government workers affected by the shutdown. They also said they would consider “forbearance” on credit card loans and other payments, but the issue faded in importance when Congress decided after two weeks to approve temporary funding. Some large banks that ran into credit problems during the financial crisis consulted with regulators to get permission for the programs. The Wells spokesman said it was not required to do so. Wells dominates the U.S. mortgage landscape, although its lending and servicing portfolios are getting smaller. The bank made $80 billion in home loans last quarter, down from $139 billion a year earlier as mortgage refinancings fell because of rising long-term interest rates. The bank said on Oct. 17 that it is cutting 925 mortgage jobs as a result of slower activity. Bank of America Corp., which lost $1 billion in its mortgage business during the third quarter, said Thursday it expects to cut 3,000 mortgage-related jobs by yearend",10242013,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-mortgage-waivers/wells-fargo-waives-october-mortgage-fees-for-late-payers-idUSL1N0IE1AN20131024
793,WFC,Why Wells Fargo's loan losses are plunging,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s (WFC.N) loan book is performing better than many of its peers and better than even the bank expected in the middle of the last year, thanks to factors including higher house prices and tougher loan standards. In the third quarter, Wells posted its lowest quarterly loan loss rate in at least nine years. The lower losses allowed the bank to dip into funds it set aside to cover bad loans, boosting profits by about $600 million after taxes. Part of the improvement stems from a 2009 move to tighten underwriting standards for consumer loans, like more stringent requirements for verifying prospective homeowners’ income. Residential real estate loans made since then “have virtually no losses,” Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan said at an investor conference in September. Another factor helping loan performance: post-crisis loans make up a larger share of Wells Fargo’s portfolio overall now, driving quality higher. Nearly half the commercial loans and around 45 percent of consumer loans on the books at the end of the third quarter were made after the financial crisis. Meanwhile, home prices increased 12.4 percent nationwide in August from a year earlier, according to CoreLogic. That had a big impact on the quality of Wells Fargo’s home equity loans, where losses, also called charge-offs, fell by nearly 3/4 since the third quarter of 2012. Many of these loans are hovering just below or just above the value of the home, so as home prices go up, the losses on the loans can change dramatically, a spokeswoman said. Over half of the decline in loan losses between the third quarters of 2013 and 2012 came out of Wells Fargo’s home equity portfolio. “When you put all that together,” Sloan told Reuters in a recent interview, “it makes for a rapid improvement in credit quality.” To be sure, Wells Fargo is not the only U.S. bank to benefit from more of its customers paying their bills. Bank of America’s total loss rate declined to 0.73 percent in the third quarter, a level not seen at the bank since 2005, Chief Executive Brian Moynihan told analysts. Bank of America reduced its allowance for bad loans by $1.4 billion in the third quarter. “I don’t think anybody expected charge-offs a few years ago to be as low as they are now,” investor Warren Buffett said in a October 16 CNBC interview, in which he highlighted the low loss rates at both Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Buffett is a major shareholder in both banks. Wells’ overall loss rates were even better than Bank of America’s at just 0.48 percent of the loan book, a steep drop from a year earlier. The numbers may be better because of its mix of business - commercial loans often perform better than credit card loans, for example. But credit performance has outperformed even the bank’s expectations. Wells Fargo chief risk officer Mike Loughlin said in May 2012 he expected loss rates to be about 1.00 percent through the credit cycle. These improvements in overall credit have allowed the bank to set aside less money to cover future losses. It stashed away just $75 million to cover bad loans in the third quarter, down 95 percent from the $1.6 billion set aside a year earlier. As losses continue to decline, Wells Fargo can also dip into funds set aside previously to cover bad loans, known as “releasing reserves.” The bank released $900 million of loss reserves in Q3, before taxes, or about $600 million after taxes. But the extent to which some banks are leaning on reserve releases to boost profits has caught regulators’ attention. In September, Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry said some banks had become hooked on re-purposing reserves in the form of earnings. Citing some signs of rising credit risk across the banking system, Curry said it seemed like a “singularly bad time for banks to be scrimping on their allowances against their loan losses.” Analysts said the current rate of Wells Fargo’s reserve releases might not be sustainable. Jennifer Thompson, research director at Portales Partners, said the money that Wells Fargo set aside for future losses every quarter was coming down faster than its current losses, a process that would bottom out eventually and require the bank to build reserves back up. Sloan said the bank was mindful of regulators’ views, but at the same time was bound by accounting principles that dictate reserve releases. “When your loan portfolio improves as much as ours did, it’s appropriate to release reserves,” he said. Even with the release, the money the bank has set aside over time covers four times the losses the bank could expect to have in a year at current rates, up from 3.6 times in the second quarter. “That’s a huge number,” Chief Executive John Stumpf told Reuters in a recent interview.

794,WFC,Wells Fargo settles mortgage claims with U.S. government for under $1 billion: FT,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the fourth-largest U.S. bank, has settled claims with a U.S. government agency over bad mortgages the bank sold ahead of the financial crisis, the Financial Times reported on Thursday. The San Francisco bank paid less than $1 billion to resolve claims from the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the overseer of government-backed mortgage enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter. A Wells Fargo spokesman and the government agency declined to comment. The settlement was governed by a confidentiality agreement, the Financial Times said. The bank said in a securities filing in the first quarter of 2013 that it had settled certain mortgage-backed securities claims with Fannie Mae out of previously established reserves, though it did not specify additional terms of the settlement.

The San Francisco-based bank reached a settlement in the third quarter with government-backed mortgage enterprise Freddie Mac and its overseer, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, over claims that some mortgage bonds’ offering documents contained false information, according to a regulatory filing the bank made on Wednesday. Wells Fargo did not specify how much of the $335 million settlement related to Freddie Mac and how much was related to a separate settlement it reached with Fannie Mae and the FHFA in the first quarter. The bank had already set aside money to cover the settlement, according to the filing, meaning the deal will have no impact on income. In addition to resolving mortgage bond claims with Freddie Mac, the bank announced a $869 million settlement with Freddie Mac over repurchase liabilities in September. That settlement contributed to Wells Fargo’s mortgage repurchase liability falling from $2.2 billion at the end of June to $1.4 billion at the end of September.

() The probe is one of several that seek to hold financial companies liable under FIRREA for shoddy mortgage loans that helped fuel the U.S. housing and financial crises. FIRREA has become a favorite tool to address alleged mortgage fraud because of its 10-year statute of limitations, twice the length than allowed under other federal securities laws. Lawyers in the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office turned to FIRREA last month to convince a jury that Bank of America  engaged in fraud.

797,WFC,U.S. seeks new defendant in Wells Fargo mortgage fraud case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Thursday asked for permission to add a Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) mortgage executive as a defendant in its year-old lawsuit accusing the country’s largest mortgage lender of fraud. In a letter to U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan, who oversees the case, the Department of Justice said the Wells Fargo Home Mortgage vice president it wants to add as a defendant played a “pivotal role” in allegedly causing the bank to not report defective home loans to the government. Wells Fargo, which is also the fourth-largest U.S. bank, was accused in the October 2012 lawsuit of misleading the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development into believing its loans qualified for insurance from the agency’s Federal Housing Administration, costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Furman on September 24 rejected Wells Fargo’s bid to dismiss the lawsuit, which was brought by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan. No individuals were originally named as defendants. The executive the government wants to add is identified in court papers as a male vice president of decision quality management. Neither the bank nor the Justice Department would immediately confirm the name of the person who held that title at the time of the alleged wrongdoing. No settlement talks are scheduled, Thursday’s letter said. Federal investigators have received much criticism for failing to hold enough individuals accountable for activities contributing to the recent U.S. housing and financial crises. One exception is Rebecca Mairone, a former midlevel executive at Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) Countrywide unit, who along with that bank was found liable by a Manhattan federal jury last month for selling defective mortgages to Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB. Penalties have yet to be determined. According to Thursday’s letter, the government intends to sue the individual Wells Fargo executive under the federal False Claims Act and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. The bank called the effort “unwarranted” and said it would disrupt the case. “Wells Fargo is unaware of any new facts or circumstances warranting this action nor has the government explained why it is necessary to target an individual more than a year after first filing suit,” spokesman Ancel Martinez said. According to government court papers, the executive was in 2004 charged with ensuring the proper reporting of bad loans to HUD, but “no self-reporting occurred.” The government also said the executive decided in 2005 that fewer defective loans needed to be reported to HUD, but that the bank “did not even comply with its own unilaterally narrowed formulation of Wells Fargo’s reporting obligation, and continued not to self-report any loans.” The case is U.S. v.

800,WFC,Wells Fargo targets big spenders in credit card push,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, is looking to entice more wealthy customers to use its credit cards as part of a strategy to become a more dominant player in that business, a top executive said on Thursday. The San Francisco-based bank is “clearly underrepresented” among the affluent, said Avid Modjtabai, the bank’s head of consumer lending, at the BancAnalysts Association of Boston Conference. Wells Fargo aims to grow market share over the next 18 months through a recently announced partnership with American Express Co, she added. Only 7 percent of Wells Fargo’s active credit card customers are affluent compared to an industry benchmark of 29 percent, Modjtabai said. The bank defines affluent customers as those with investible assets in excess of $250,000. In the first half of 2014, Wells Fargo will roll out new credit cards offering competitive rewards with American Express across the United States. Wells Fargo is the largest U.S. home and overall auto lender, but its share of the credit card business is comparatively small. The bank was the sixth largest issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit cards in terms of purchase volume through the middle of 2013, lagging smaller competitors like U.S. Bancorp, according to The Nilson Report. Modjtabai also said the bank expected the profitability of selling mortgages in the fourth quarter would be similar to the third quarter. The bank’s gain on sale margin was 1.42 percent in the third quarter, down from 2.21 percent in the second quarter.

802,WFC,Prosecutors seek clues on alleged tax dodgers from two U.S. banks,"(Reuters) - U.S. authorities are seeking information from Citigroup Inc’s Citibank NA and Bank of New York Mellon Corp to uncover the identities of U.S. citizens who may have been hiding money in Swiss bank accounts to avoid taxes. In a filing in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York requested permission to issue “John Doe” summonses to the two U.S. banks for records of accounts tied to the Swiss bank Zuercher Kantonalbank (ZKB). ZKB, based in Zurich, offers private banking to clients around the world, including U.S. taxpayers, according to the filing. Some of those services are provided through correspondent accounts at Citibank and BNY Mellon, it said. Both banks are not accused of any wrongdoing in the court filing. In December 2012, two ZKB bankers and a former employee were indicted over charges of conspiring with American clients to hide more than $420 million from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. ZKB used Citibank and BNY Mellon as correspondent banks to provide offshore banking services to U.S. taxpayers, “who in turn have failed to report the existence of their ZKB accounts to the IRS, as well as the income earned on those accounts,” the U.S. Attorney’s office said in its filing. The IRS uses “John Doe” summonses to get information on possible tax law breakers whose identities are unknown. In April, the IRS got a court’s permission to serve John Doe summonses to Wells Fargo & Co as part of an offshore tax evasion investigation. With John Doe summonses, “what the U.S. is trying to do is figure out who accessed their undeclared Swiss bank account money, and did anyone access it in a way that flowed through U.S. banks,” said Jeffrey Neiman, a former federal prosecutor involved in Swiss bank investigations who is now in private law practice in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Only 29 players completed the second round at El Camaleon Golf Club in Playa del Carmen as rain and lightning interrupted play for a second straight day. Stadler produced a blistering bogey-free eight-under 63 to back up his opening 67, while Karlsson, the leader after the first round was completed earlier in the day, carded a 67 following his opening 63. The duo share the lead at 12-under-par, while South African Rory Sabbatini is on nine-under through 17 holes of his second round tied with American Chris Stroud after 15. Sabbatini opened with a 68 and was six-under in the second round when play was suspended due to darkness, while Stroud opened with a 66 and is four-under for his second round. Venezuelan Jhonattan Vegas (66,68) and Americans Ryan Moore (67,67), Pat Perez (66, three-under through 14) and Jay McLuen (67, four-under through 14) shared fifth at eight-under. Karlsson, an 11-time winner on the European Tour, is only in the field courtesy of his top 10 finish in last week’s McGladrey Classic, where he was a sponsor’s invite. Having gone through a rough patch over the last few years, the former world number six has no status on the PGA Tour and has slipped to 287th in the world. His last win on the European Tour came almost three years ago at the Dubai World Championship. A week after being in contention but fading to a tie for 10th in Georgia, Stadler is searching for his first career PGA Tour win in his 237th start. The son of former Masters champion Craig had five birdies in his last seven holes.

809,WFC,"Streelman, Bjorn lead World Cup Down Under","MELBOURNE (Reuters) - American Kevin Streelman bogeyed two of his last three holes to fall back into a share of a one-stroke lead with Denmark’s Thomas Bjorn after the first round of the $8 million World Cup of Golf on Thursday, as the headline acts toiled Down Under. Streelman, a late choice to represent the defending champion United States team, had torn up Royal Melbourne’s back nine with five birdies in six holes but dropped shots on the tricky 16th and 18th to card a 66 and join Bjorn on five-under. The pair finished a stroke ahead of Welshman Stuart Manley, South Korea’s K.J. Choi and Scotland’s Martin Laird. “I was very pleased with that start,” the 35-year-old Streelman told reporters after upstaging world number seven compatriot Matt Kuchar (71), who won the last World Cup for the U.S. with Gary Woodland in 2011 when it was purely a team event. “It’s just an incredible golf course, I love it... I just had a lot of fun there to be honest.” The tournament’s format has been changed from being solely a team event to primarily an individual one with a team component. Sixty players are competing for individual honors while 26 two-player teams are competing for the team prize. Having given themselves every chance of winning the individual trophy, Streelman and European Tour journeyman Bjorn also put their nations in the box seat for team honors. Streelman and Kuchar’s combined score of five-under left the United States level with Denmark’s Bjorn and Thorbjorn Olesen (71), three strokes ahead of Portugal’s Jose-Filipa Lima (71) and Ricardo Santos (69). Along with fluky gusts of wind, the flint-hard greens at the famed sandbelt course conspired to leave most of the favorites grinding through bogey-strewn back nines, but only one disastrous hole was needed to leave local hero Adam Scott all but out of contention. The world number two had grafted patiently to one-under at the turn but racked up a quintuple-bogey nine at the par-four 12th after putting two tee-shots into a tangle of scrub and losing his first ball. The 33-year-old put his third tee-shot into light rough before over-cooking his approach and ended up missing a 12-foot putt for eight to post his worst single-hole score in a PGA Tour event for six years. Scott never recovered, finishing four-over, but there was some cheer for local fans as his compatriot Jason Day shot a solid 68 to be two off the pace, alone on three-under. Day, grieving the loss of eight relatives in the Philippines who were killed in Typhoon Haiyan, rolled in five birdies and two bogeys in his first round in five weeks. Former major winner Graeme McDowell, playing for Ireland, was another of the tournament’s contenders to struggle and finished with a one-over 72. McDowell enjoyed one of the shots of the day, holing a long-range chip for an eagle on the par-four ninth, but stumbled with double-bogeys on the sixth and 18th.

815,WFC,Wells Fargo: U.S. targeting exec as defendant may be retaliation,"NEW YORK, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said Monday that a U.S. government request to add one of its executives as a defendant in a fraud case may be in retaliation for the bank’s decision to cut off settlement talks. In a motion filed in New York federal court opposing the Justice Department’s request to add executive Kurt Lofrano as a defendant, Wells Fargo said it told the government it would no longer engage in settlement negotiations on Oct. 29 after months of discussions. Three days later, the government for the first time said it would seek to add an unnamed executive, later revealed to be Lofrano, to its year-old lawsuit accusing the bank of fraud during the lead-up to the financial meltdown. “In the absence of any other explanation for the lengthy delay, this intervening event - within days of the notice - raises questions about whether the United States acted in bad faith, in retaliation for Wells Fargo’s message,” the bank’s lawyers said in court papers. The bank questioned why the Justice Department waited a year before deciding to pursue claims against Lofrano, who has joined a very short list of individual executives to be sued by the government over actions that contributed to the financial crisis. The U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment on the filing. Wells Fargo, the country’s largest mortgage lender, is accused of misleading the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development into believing defective home loans qualified for insurance from the Federal Housing Administration, causing the government hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. The bank has denied the allegations. On Nov. 22, the Justice Department asked U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman for permission to add Lofrano, who it said played a “critical role” in the bank’s alleged failure to report the loans’ flaws to the government. He worked as vice president for quality control from 2002 to 2010, a position that made him responsible for the bank’s self-reporting policies, the government said. He remains employed at the bank. In a statement following the government’s request, Wells Fargo said Lofrano was a “well respected team member” and that it stood by him unequivocally. Furman denied the bank’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit in September. The case is U.S. v.

816,WFC,UPDATE 2-Top U.S. banks faulted on correcting foreclosure abuses,"By Aruna Viswanatha WASHINGTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Top U.S. banks, including Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc, failed to fully comply with a government settlement to correct mortgage servicing abuses, a monitor of the settlement said on Wednesday. Bank of America failed to file accurate documents in bankruptcy proceedings, and Citi’s mortgage unit failed to notify borrowers about missing documents within 30 days of a request for a short sale, the monitor, Joseph Smith Jr., said. The two banks have submitted plans to fix those problems and are in the process of correcting earlier failures, he said. JPMorgan Chase & Co was also cited in Smith’s report. The problems stem from a $25 billion deal between federal and state authorities and five top mortgage servicers in 2012 designed to end foreclosure abuses. Under the settlement, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo & Co and Residential Capital LLC were required to improve their procedures for dealing with struggling borrowers. They were also required to submit to dozens of tests to measure their improvement. In a statement, Bank of America said it has “worked diligently” to comply with the terms of the settlement and to ensure struggling borrowers know they are being treated fairly. The problems with the bankruptcy filings were limited to one quarter and impacted a “relatively small population,” the bank said. It also said none of the problems resulted in inaccurate foreclosures or improper denials of requests to modify loans. Citigroup said in a statement that it “remains committed to fulfilling the terms” of the settlement. It said it became aware of certain problems last May and took steps to fix them. Wells Fargo did not fail any tests this year, according to Smith’s report. Smith said in a statement that while the banks still have additional work to do, he was hopeful the fixes would improve how borrowers are treated. JPMorgan failed in some instances in 2013 to make decisions on borrower applications to modify loans within a timetable required, and it failed a test that measures whether a pre-foreclosure notice sent to customers was accurate, according to the report. Smith said those problems were not widespread at the bank and that JPMorgan had fixed the problems and compensated harmed borrowers. A JPMorgan representative said in a statement, “We proactively addressed the monitor’s findings and are pleased that he determined that our corrective action plan is complete.” In October, Bank of America and Wells Fargo pledged to improve communications with borrowers seeking to modify their loans, after authorities found additional problems not covered by the 2012 deal. One state, New York, accused Wells Fargo in federal court of breaching the terms of the $25 billion deal and said the bank did not go far enough in its commitments. That dispute is pending.

821,WFC,"LA sues Citi, Wells Fargo over discriminatory mortgage lending","(Reuters) - The city of Los Angeles has filed a lawsuit against Citigroup (C.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N), seeking damages for a loss in tax revenue due to discriminatory mortgage lending to the city’s minority communities, a court filing showed. In complaints filed in the U.S. Federal Court, LA City attorney Mike Feuer said that Citigroup and Wells Fargo “engaged in a continuous pattern and practice of mortgage discrimination in Los Angeles since at least 2004 by imposing different terms or conditions on a discriminatory and legally prohibited basis.” Spokeswomen for Citigroup and Wells Fargo told Reuters that the lawsuit is without merit. Major banks are already waging multiple court battles relating to their mortgage lending practices and have so far paid billions of dollars in fines and penalties to various U.S. authorities. Foreclosures are on the rise in many of United States’ most vulnerable neighborhoods, particularly those with substantial concentrations of minority households, the complaint said. The lawsuit also said that overall, low and moderate-income African-Americans and middle and higher-income Latinos, have experienced the highest foreclosure rates. According to a report, during 2008-2012, the mortgage crisis in Los Angeles resulted in over 200,000 foreclosures and an estimated $78 billion in decreased home values. Property tax revenue losses during that period are estimated to be $481 million, the filing showed. “When banks engage in such discriminatory conduct, the misconduct has profound financial consequences for the cities in which mortgaged properties exist, and banks should be responsible for those financial consequences. Banks should reimburse such cities for lost tax revenues due to discriminatory lending,” the lawsuit said. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer Temple said that the bank is deeply disappointed by the City Attorney’s decision to file a “meritless” lawsuit. “The accusations made by the City Attorney are baseless, do not in any way reflect our values as a company, and we will vigorously defend ourselves. We will continue to focus on helping customers succeed financially and expanding homeownership in California and across the United States,” Temple said in an emailed statement to Reuters. Citigroup spokeswoman Liz Fogarty said the bank is disappointed that the LA Attorney does not recognize its deep commitment to fair lending. “Citi considers each applicant by the same objective criteria, which are blind to race, ethnicity, gender and any other prohibited basis,” Fogarty said.

Lofrano would be the first individual targeted in the lawsuit, which was originally brought in October 2012. The U.S. Department of Justice accused Wells Fargo of misleading the Department of Housing and Urban Development into believing many of its loans qualified for federal insurance, costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Wells Fargo had questioned why the government waited a year before pursuing Lofrano, suggesting it might be in retaliation for the bank’s late October decision to end settlement talks. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman nonetheless concluded that the government could add Lofrano and amend its complaint, substantially for the reasons it cited. The government said Lofrano played a “critical role” in Wells Fargo’s decision not to report to HUD more than 6,000 materially defective loans that the San Francisco-based bank falsely certified for Federal Housing Administration insurance. It also said Lofrano, as vice president for quality control from 2002 to 2010, was responsible to ensure proper reporting but kept many defective loans “secret,” causing HUD to pay more than $189 million in insurance for loans that were not eligible. The government seeks to hold Lofrano liable under the federal False Claims Act and the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said, “We are disappointed in the ruling, but respect the court’s decision, and we fully support Mr. Lofrano.” Federal investigators have received much criticism for failing to hold enough individuals accountable for activities contributing to the recent U.S. housing and financial crises.

827,WFC,"Wells Fargo sweetens brokers' deferred pay, retirement incentives","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo Advisors outlined its 2014 compensation plan for retail brokers on Thursday, dramatically increasing the deferred compensation brokers can receive for meeting revenue goals, making more brokers eligible for expense accounts and tinkering with their monthly revenue targets. Wells, the third largest U.S. brokerage firm with about 11,000 branch-based advisers, is the last of the big U.S. firms to spell out pay plans that influence how their brokers conduct sales and money-gathering efforts in the coming year. Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) Merrill Lynch and UBS AG’s UBSN.VX U.S. brokerage unit unveiled plans two weeks ago that reward asset gathering, encourage brokers to work in teams and toughened revenue targets for lower-tier advisers. Wells has picked up on those trends, with twists. Several brokers said the deferred bonus targets are considerably higher than expected. Brokers with annual revenue of $300,000 to $500,000 can earn deferred cash of as much as 8.25 percent of that total, up from 2 percent, if they meet one of four targets tied to metrics such as new client assets, loans and writing financial plans this year. Brokers who bring in $2.1 million or more can get 11 percent of the total, up from 8.5 percent. The bonus potential, and Wells’ decision to remove caps on the amount, puts the deferred bonus awards “into orbit,” said one adviser. “I listened to where the pain points were,” David Kowach, president of Well’s branch-based private client group said in explaining how the changes can help both top and lower-tier advisers. The deferred compensation presents the “biggest opportunity” for brokers and their managers, he added. Wall Street has been steadily raising deferred compensation, seeing it as a way to delay immediate cash payouts and to lock in employees who might be tempted to jump to rival firms. Wells requires brokers to remain at least five years to collect their deferred cash. However, Danny Sarch, a headhunter for brokers, said firms are getting more generous with the potential awards because many brokers do not stick around for the delayed payout. Wells Fargo Advisors also adjusted its core payment plan. Unlike rivals that pay brokers a flat percentage of the fees and commissions they produce, the Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) subsidiary has a two-tier system that currently pays all brokers 22 percent of the first $12,000 they bring in every month and 50 percent on anything earned above that. In past years, Wells has raised the hurdle for the higher payout by $1,000 with each new pay plan. That “tax” is no longer in effect, Kowach said. In 2014, there will be three hurdles to the higher payout. Low-producing brokers will have to breach $13,250 each month before they graduate to a 50 percent payout. Mid-level ones must wait until they hit $12,500. Top-producing brokers, however, hit the 50 percent hurdle at $11,500, down from $12,000 this year. Most of Wells’ cash incentives-immediate and deferred-are tied to hitting targets related to improved revenue, creation of financial plans for clients and growth of wealthy households. Kowach said that, unlike most of Wells’ rivals, the firm this year is not gearing its bonuses to fee-based, rather than commission-based, accounts. “Transactional business is half of our revenue and represents most of our client assets,” Kowach said. “I want our people to do great business and help clients win regardless of the compensation model.” Most brokerage firms have skewed bonuses in recent years to fee-based accounts that generate revenue year-to-year, regardless of how often clients trade. Commission accounts tend to veer wildly as clients make trades in rising markets and withhold transactions when markets fall. In other enhancements, Wells is giving more brokers expense accounts to entertain clients and prospects in 2014, including a token $500 amount to those who produce $300,000 to $500,000 and did not previously qualify. Top-tier brokers can get $15,000 entertainment accounts. Like its rivals, Wells also has added incentives for advisers who work on teams, and has simplified penalties for brokers who discount commissions from its published price. Wells also addressed its “aging broker” issue with an enhanced road-to-retirement program. The average age of a Wells broker is 56, and many are having a hard time finding younger brokers in their branches that they trust to take over their “books.” In 2014, Wells will let them search wider for a successor within their geographic regions. It also has developed a valuation analysis that lets retirees sell their practice for as much as 1.6 times the revenue they produced in the previous 12 months. Older brokers also can remain at the firm for five years, up from three, after announcing their retirement plans as the firm looks for way to help them pass clients to younger brokers.

Brokers with annual revenue of $300,000 to $500,000 can earn deferred cash of as much as 8.25 percent of that total, up from 2 percent, if they meet one of four targets tied to metrics such as new client assets, loans and writing financial plans this year. Brokers who bring in $2.1 million or more can get 11 percent of the total, up from 8.5 percent. The bonus potential, and Wells’ decision to remove caps on the amount, puts the deferred bonus awards “into orbit,” said one adviser. “I listened to where the pain points were,” David Kowach, president of Well’s branch-based private client group said in explaining how the changes can help both top and lower-tier advisers. The deferred compensation presents the “biggest opportunity” for brokers and their managers, he added. Wall Street has been steadily raising deferred compensation, seeing it as a way to delay immediate cash payouts and to lock in employees who might be tempted to jump to rival firms. Wells requires brokers to remain at least five years to collect their deferred cash. However, Danny Sarch, a headhunter for brokers, said firms are getting more generous with the potential awards because many brokers do not stick around for the delayed payout. Wells Fargo Advisors also adjusted its core payment plan. Unlike rivals that pay brokers a flat percentage of the fees and commissions they produce, the Wells Fargo & Co  subsidiary has a two-tier system that currently pays all brokers 22 percent of the first $12,000 they bring in every month and 50 percent on anything earned above that. In past years, Wells has raised the hurdle for the higher payout by $1,000 with each new pay plan. That “tax” is no longer in effect, Kowach said. In 2014, there will be three hurdles to the higher payout. Low-producing brokers will have to breach $13,250 each month before they graduate to a 50 percent payout. Mid-level ones must wait until they hit $12,500. Top-producing brokers, however, hit the 50 percent hurdle at $11,500, down from $12,000 this year. Most of Wells’ cash incentives-immediate and deferred-are tied to hitting targets related to improved revenue, creation of financial plans for clients and growth of wealthy households. Kowach said that, unlike most of Wells’ rivals, the firm this year is not gearing its bonuses to fee-based, rather than commission-based, accounts. “Transactional business is half of our revenue and represents most of our client assets,” Kowach said. “I want our people to do great business and help clients win regardless of the compensation model.” Most brokerage firms have skewed bonuses in recent years to fee-based accounts that generate revenue year-to-year, regardless of how often clients trade. Commission accounts tend to veer wildly as clients make trades in rising markets and withhold transactions when markets fall. In other enhancements, Wells is giving more brokers expense accounts to entertain clients and prospects in 2014, including a token $500 amount to those who produce $300,000 to $500,000 and did not previously qualify. Top-tier brokers can get $15,000 entertainment accounts. Like its rivals, Wells also has added incentives for advisers who work on teams, and has simplified penalties for brokers who discount commissions from its published price. Wells also addressed its “aging broker” issue with an enhanced road-to-retirement program. The average age of a Wells broker is 56, and many are having a hard time finding younger brokers in their branches that they trust to take over their “books.” In 2014, Wells will let them search wider for a successor within their geographic regions. It also has developed a valuation analysis that lets retirees sell their practice for as much as 1.6 times the revenue they produced in the previous 12 months. Older brokers also can remain at the firm for five years, up from three, after announcing their retirement plans as the firm looks for way to help them pass clients to younger brokers.

833,WFC,Wells Fargo agrees to $541 million loan settlement,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co will pay a net $541 million to Fannie Mae to settle claims over defective home loans, completing the government-controlled mortgage company’s efforts to have banks buy back troubled loans made before the financial crisis. Fannie Mae said on Monday it has reached settlements worth roughly $6.5 billion over loan buybacks with eight banks, including Wells Fargo, the nation’s largest mortgage lender and fourth-largest bank by assets. The settlements include a $3.6 billion accord in January with Bank of America Corp over loans from that bank and the former Countrywide Financial Corp. Fannie Mae Chief Executive Timothy Mayopoulos was once general counsel at Bank of America. It also includes a $968 million accord in July with Citigroup Inc. In the Wells Fargo settlement, the San Francisco-based bank will pay Fannie Mae $541 million in cash after adjusting for credits from prior repurchases. Before adjustments, the settlement totaled $591 million. The accord resolves substantially all repurchase claims against Wells Fargo over loans sold to Fannie Mae that were made before 2009. “We have closed out our legacy repurchase reviews with this agreement,” Mayopoulos said in a statement. “This agreement represents a fitting conclusion to our year of hard work to put legacy issues in the rear view mirror and begin 2014 focused on improving the future of housing finance.” Wells Fargo agreed in September to pay a net $780 million to the smaller Freddie Mac to resolve similar repurchase claims. It said it had set aside sufficient funds for the Fannie Mae settlement. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were directed by its regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), to reduce outstanding loan repurchase demands by year end, and have been reaching many agreements with individual lenders. Banks can be forced to buy back home loans if representations and warranties concerning the underwriting and whether borrowers could afford to make payments prove false. Freddie Mac did not immediately respond on Monday to a request for comment on its repurchase efforts. The FHFA is also pursuing lawsuits against many banks over mortgage securities sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee two-thirds of U.S. home loans. The government seized them on September 7, 2008 and put them into a conservatorship. As of last month, taxpayers had nearly broken even on the bailout.

838,WFC,Fitch: Wells Fargo 4Q'13 Results: Net Income Remains Strong,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 14 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) reported another  quarter of record earnings despite a relatively weak economic recovery and  challenging interest rate environment. Earnings ticked up slightly, buoyed by  both modest revenue growth and controlled expenses, resulting in a solid return  on average assets (ROA) of 1.47%. Fitch views the results favorably as WFC  appears to have been able to react nimbly to the changing mortgage refinancing  market. WFC's credit profile also benefits from continuing improvement in asset  quality, and unlike some of its large bank peers, WFC has reported relatively  manageable litigation-related charges to date.  Revenues were up slightly (1%) on both higher spread income and improved  noninterest income. WFC reported decent sequential loan growth with loans  increasing 7% on an annualized basis from the prior quarter, with broad-based  growth across many asset classes. Fitch expects this level of loan growth will  surpass peer averages.  The net interest margin (NIM) continued to contract a  further 12bps in 4Q'13, reflecting both deposit growth and liquidity-related  actions taken last quarter by WFC.  Mortgage results were relatively resilient in 4Q'13. While mortgage originations  declined by nearly 40%, mortgage banking noninterest income fell only 2% from  the prior quarter. Servicing income increased by roughly 40% due primarily to a  write-up in the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) asset in light  of higher mortgage interest rates. Offsetting this, gain on sale revenue fell  22%, reflecting lower origination volumes. Offsetting the decline in mortgage  revenues, WFC reported stronger trust and investment fees, up 6% on a  linked-quarter basis.   Expenses were flat sequentially. Lower staffing costs in mortgage were offset by  higher equipment expenses reflecting annual license renewals. WFC also reported  higher outside professional services expenses related to compliance and  regulatory-related initiatives.  WFC reported a smaller reserve release on a sequential basis of $600 million as  compared to $900 million last quarter. Net charge-offs (NCOs) remained very  manageable at just 47bps of average loans during the quarter supported by lower  consumer losses. Provision expenses increased to $363 million during the  quarter, up from just $75 million last quarter, marking the first increase in  quarterly provision expenses for the year. WFC expects future reserve releases, absent a significant deterioration in  economic conditions. Fitch notes that NCOs at this level are likely not  sustainable, with historical losses more around the 100bps range.  As previously disclosed, WFC has now reached agreements with both Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac resolving substantially all repurchase liabilities related to loans  sold prior to Jan. 1, 2009. Fitch viewed these agreements favorably as they  resolve the majority of mortgage-related repurchase risk for WFC. Existing and  any future repurchase requests would stem from loans sold to the GSEs outside of  the covered periods, as well as to private investors. The ending balance of  reserves totaled approximately $900 million or 127% of the original loan balance  of unresolved repurchase demands as of Dec. 31, 2013.  Tier 1 common under Basel III improved by approximately 22bps to an estimated  9.78% at Dec. 31, 2013, and exceeded the company's internal target of 9%. Fitch  views WFC as well-positioned for Basel III capital guidelines. Net unrealized  securities gains totaled $3.9 billion at year-end 2013, down from $5.8 billion  at Sept. 30, 2013, primarily driven by an increase in interest rates during the  quarter. As an Advanced Approach bank, WFC will be ultimately be subject to  fluctuations in AOCI under Basel III..

840,WFC,UPDATE 4-Wells Fargo profit beats estimates; mortgage loans slump,"By Peter Rudegeair and Anil D’Silva Jan 14 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co posted a better-than-expected 11 percent jump in quarterly profit as it cut costs, but mortgage lending slowed to the lowest level in five years. The fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets said core lending grew by 6 percent, boosted by a sharp jump in trade finance, commercial real estate and other loans to foreign companies and a 10 percent rise in auto loans - a feat that Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan called “absolutely terrific.” The bank also dipped into money it had set aside to cover bad loans, as credit quality improved with a recovering economy. “We sit here this January as an economy, and frankly as a company, in better shape than I have sat here in the last five or six Januaries,” Chief Executive John Stumpf said on a conference call after Wells Fargo reported its results. He said he is optimistic that loans and revenues could increase over time. Stumpf’s somewhat upbeat outlook shows how the industry is still waiting for the economic recovery to translate into more broad-based loan growth and profits. The mortgage business, which had been one bright spot for banks such as Wells, suffered a steep decline industry-wide as fewer consumers refinanced home loans because of higher mortgage rates. At Wells Fargo, the mortgage decline overshadowed improvements in many of its 89 other businesses. The bank’s revenue fell 6 percent to $20.7 billion. Wells made nearly one in five U.S. home loans in the first nine months of 2013, according to industry publication Inside Mortgage Finance. In 2013, the business accounted for 10 percent of the bank’s overall revenues. “They have various other business lines to offset” the decline in mortgages, said Christopher Mutascio, a banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. “But that’s just it - they can only offset it; they can’t grow revenue.” Wells Fargo made $50 billion of residential mortgage loans in the quarter, less than half the $125 billion in the same period a year earlier and down from $80 billion in the third quarter. Income from mortgage lending fell to $1.6 billion from $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012. The last time the bank made that few home loans was in the fourth quarter of 2008 at the depths of the financial crisis. Sloan said on a conference call with analysts that the bank expects mortgage volume to continue to fall in the first quarter of 2014, though not as much as in the third and final quarters of 2013. JPMorgan Chase & Co, which also reported quarterly profits on Tuesday, also said its mortgage business slowed, although the largest U.S. bank by assets also had to contend with other headaches, notably its legal issues. Wells Fargo’s shares edged up 0.07 percent to close at $45.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. Fourth-quarter net income applicable to common shareholders increased to $5.37 billion, or $1 per share, from $4.86 billion, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier, the San Francisco-based bank said on Tuesday. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 98 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Expenses in the bank’s home loan unit fell after it cut 6,200 positions in the second half of 2013. Those severance costs mostly impacted the bank’s third quarter results. The lower personnel expenses pushed its efficiency ratio, or expenses relative to revenue, to 58.5 percent and into its targeted range of 55 to 59 percent. Net income also got a boost as the bank released $600 million from its loss reserves, or money previously set aside to cover bad loans. That was more than double the $250 million released in the year-earlier quarter but less than the $900 million released in the third quarter. Seeing a bank increase profits with lower revenues is more encouraging than seeing lower profits with higher revenues, “so you’d have to be a hater to find fault in their results,” said Chris Richey, a portfolio manager and managing director at Neosho Capital, a $165 million investment firm that holds Wells Fargo shares. Wells Fargo is one of the few large U.S. banks to emerge much stronger from the financial crisis, thanks in part to its acquisition of Wachovia, which closed just over five years ago. Many of the old Wachovia businesses performed well in the quarter. The bank’s wealth, brokerage and retirement group earned $491 million, up nearly 40 percent from the same period a year earlier. Profit from advising wealthy clients on investments and financial planning rose 40 percent from a year earlier to $140 million on just 11 percent growth in client assets and deposits. This compared with a 4 percent rise in wholesale banking profit and a 12 percent jump in community banking profit. The wealth sector also led the other businesses in cross-marketing, a major goal of big institutions such as Bank of America Corp and Wells that own retail brokerage networks. Average loans generated by the wealth sector grew to $48.4 billion in the fourth quarter from $43.3 billion a year earlier. The average client in the wealth sector ended the year owning 10.42 Wells products, such as a checking account or an IRA, up from 10.27 a year ago. The cross-sell in the wholesale bank was 7.1 products per relationship. Wells Fargo increased its market share of the U.S. investment banking business to 5.6 percent in 2013, up from 5 percent in 2012 as revenue from existing wholesale banking customers grew 16 percent. The bank had acquired its investment banking business from Wachovia. The growth in that business declined in the fourth quarter as sales and trading slowed, Sloan said in an interview. Wells Fargo’s stock jumped 28.7 percent in 2013, but lagged the 34.3 percent increase in the KBW index of bank stocks . The company had a market value of $243.2 billion at the end of the year, making it the largest U.S. bank by that measure.

841,WFC,US STOCKS-Wall St bounces modestly on retail sales boost,"* JPMorgan, Wells Fargo post earnings * Retail sales increase over prior month * GameStop tumbles after outlook * Indexes up: Dow 0.13 pct, S&P; 0.18 pct, Nasdaq 0.37 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded modestly on Tuesday, a day after the S&P; 500 suffered its biggest drop in two months, buoyed by solid retail sales data and as investors digested earnings from JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. Retail sales provided a boost after data showed a 0.7 percent increase in December, excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, after a 0.2 percent rise in November. “It’s conducive to the growth story that is becoming increasing popular,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. “From an economic perspective, the real economy continues to gain traction, but from a market perspective, the stronger the economy looks, the more we need to look and see whether, in fact, the Fed might be pulling back sooner than people think.” The first of the large banks reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts’ estimates, with a mixed outcome on their share prices; JPMorgan Chase & Co gained 1 percent to $58.25, while Wells Fargo lost 0.9 percent to $45.15. The S&P; financial index advanced 0.3 percent. As the Federal Reserve begins winding down its stimulus, which helped boost the S&P; 500 by 30 percent last year, investors may need to be more selective about stock valuations. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the index is the highest in nearly seven years. The benchmark S&P; index fell 1.3 percent on Monday, its worst decline since Nov. 7, as investors exercised caution amid a ream of negative corporate earnings outlooks. Later in the week, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are among the financial companies scheduled to post results. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.01 points or 0.13 percent, to 16,278.95, the S&P; 500 gained 3.28 points or 0.18 percent, to 1,822.48 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 15.265 points or 0.37 percent, to 4,128.569. Stratasys Ltd dropped 6.5 percent to $121.55 after the 3D printer maker estimated full-year adjusted profit well below Wall Street estimates, as it warned expenses would rise significantly in 2014. GameStop Corp plunged 18.4 percent to $37.01 as the worst performer on the S&P; 500 after the video game retailer forecast fourth-quarter profit below analysts’ estimates. In contrast, Intuitive Surgical advanced 9.7 percent to $431.50 as the best performer on the benchmark S&P; index and the Nasdaq 100 after the surgical equipment maker gave its fourth-quarter and full-year 2013 outlook. The market was underpinned by brisk merger activity. Google Inc gained 0.7 percent to $1,131.12. The world’s largest online search engine announced late Monday a $3.2 billion deal to buy smart thermostat and smoke alarm maker Nest Labs Inc. Charter Communications Inc on Monday formally offered to acquire larger rival Time Warner Cable for $37.3 billion, sparking what is likely to be a contentious battle to control the No. 2 U.S. cable operator.

Futures received a boost after data showed retail sales excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, increased 0.7 percent last month after a 0.2 percent rise in November. “It’s conducive to the growth story that is becoming increasing popular,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial in Waltham, Massachusetts. “From an economic perspective, the real economy continues to gain traction, but from a market perspective the stronger the economy looks the more we need to look and see whether in fact the Fed might be pulling back sooner than people think.” The first of the large banks to post quarterly earnings yielded mixed results. JPMorgan Chase & Co edged up 0.7 percent to $58.10 in choppy premarket trading after posting quarterly earnings. Wells Fargo fell 0.5 percent to $45.34 after results. As the Federal Reserve begins winding down its stimulus, which was largely responsible for the 29.6 percent climb in the S&P; 500 last year, investors may be forced to become more selective about stock valuations. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for the index is the highest in nearly seven years. The benchmark S&P; index fell 1.3 percent on Monday, its worst decline Nov. 7, as investors exercised caution amid mounting negative corporate outlooks. Almost 10 of every 11 earnings pre-announcements for the current earnings season from S&P; 500 companies have lowered estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data, which would be the lowest on record if it continues. Later in the week, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are among the financial companies scheduled to post results. S&P; 500 futures rose 4.4 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures gained 29 points and Nasdaq 100 futures added 9.5 points. Stratasys Ltd dropped 4.3 percent to $124.42 before the opening bell after the 3D printer maker, estimated full-year adjusted profit way below Wall Street estimates, as it warned expenses would rise significantly in 2014. GameStop Corp tumbled 13.5 percent to $39.20 in premarket trade after the video game retailer forecast fourth-quarter profit below analysts’ estimates. But Intuitive Surgical advanced 11.7 percent to $439 before the opening bell after the surgical equipment maker gave its fourth-quarter and full-year 2013 outlook.

846,WFC,"Wells, U.S. Bancorp to stop contentious short-term loans","(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co and U.S. Bancorp said on Friday they would stop offering customers a type of small, short-term loan that has come under regulatory scrutiny. The so-called deposit advance products are similar to payday loans, in that they are both small, short-term loans and have been criticized by consumer activists for their high fees. These loans are automatically repaid out of future direct deposits into checking accounts. A typical deposit advance loan can carry fees of $1.50 to $2 for every $20 borrowed. In November, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said they would make rules for deposit advance products more stringent. The regulators said they planned to impose additional limits such as requiring a one-month cooling-off period between the time one loan is repaid and another can be extended. “We are encouraging the banks we supervise to develop new and innovative programs to meet the small-dollar credit needs of their customers in ways that do not carry the risk of creating a cycle of high-cost debt,” Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry said in an email.

850,WFC,Wells Fargo to sell servicing rights to $39 billion in home loans,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) said on Wednesday that it would sell Ocwen Financial Corp (OCN.N) the right to collect payments on 184,000 home loans representing roughly 2 percent of its residential portfolio.

The sale of the servicing rights comes as new companies like Atlanta-based Ocwen, which focuses on collecting payments on residential and commercial mortgages, have driven up demand for these assets.

The San Francisco-based bank neither made nor owned the underlying mortgages in Wednesday’s deal.

853,WFC,"Cink in control at Torrey Pines, Tiger cards a 72","(Reuters) - Stewart Cink, seeking his first PGA Tour title in five years, charged into a one-shot lead at the Farmers Insurance Open on Thursday as Phil Mickelson also moved into early contention despite nursing a troublesome back. Mickelson, who frequently winced at the top of his backswing because of muscle pain down his side, carded a three-under 69 on the easier North Course while seven-times champion Tiger Woods opened with an even 72 on the brutal South layout. Cink, who has not triumphed anywhere since his playoff victory over Tom Watson in the 2009 British Open at Turnberry, fired a flawless 64 on the North to seize control of the PGA Tour event at picturesque Torrey Pines outside San Diego. The 40-year-old Cink birdied four of his last six holes to end a mainly sunny day which began with a fog delay of 30 minutes one stroke in front of fellow American Gary Woodland, who also started out on the North. Australians Jason Day and Marc Leishman, South African Tyrone van Aswegen and American Jim Herman opened with 66s while American Pat Perez, with a 67, was the only player in the top 16 who played on the more difficult South layout. Tour veteran Cink was delighted with his opening round, despite totaling just one birdie on the four par-five holes. “If you drive it well on the North Course, you’re going to have birdie opportunities and I drove it very well most of the day,” the tall American told Golf Channel. “It was just a different game from the short grass out there. You’ve got some shorter holes and I took advantage of a lot of those holes ... the par-fives, I didn’t play those very well. It was a very calm, very relaxed kind of round.” Cink, a six-times winner on the PGA Tour, knows he will face a very different challenge in Friday’s second round on the South Course, which played almost four strokes harder than the North on Thursday. “It’s definitely a tale of two golf courses here,” he smiled. “The South we all know is one of the most difficult courses on the tour and it pretty much requires all facets of the game to be on. “I have been playing fairly well this year … so I am looking forward to the challenge. It’s a big golf course to really test yourself and see where you stand this time of year.” Woods, competing in his first tournament of the year, offset two birdies with two bogeys on a South layout playing tougher than usual because of firm conditions, narrow fairways and thick rough. “Well, even par’s not too bad, but I didn’t play the par-fives worth a darn today,” said the world number one, who clinched last year’s Farmers Insurance Open by four shots in a fog-delayed Monday finish. “I played them even par, parred all of them ... to try to get any kind of scoring on the South course you’ve got to take care of the par-fives because there’s not a lot of holes you can make birdies here. “It (the South) has got to be playing right around three shots easier, so I’m going to have to go out there and get it a little bit tomorrow to not be so far behind come Saturday or Sunday.” San Diego native Mickelson, a three-times champion at Torrey Pines, mixed four birdies with a lone bogey to climb the leaderboard and was thankful he had played his opening round on the less daunting North. “I kind of milked my way around the golf course and I was able to do that on the North Course because the penalty wasn’t as severe as it is on the South,” the American left-hander said. “I am able to kind of get it up by the green and get up and down and salvage par. I made a couple of birdies but it won’t hold up on the South Course so I’ve got to get it better.” Asked to explain what was wrong, Mickelson replied: “From the top (on the swing), it just kept locking up and giving me a shooting pain. I kind of flinch. “If I overdo it, it’s just prone to getting a little bit tight. It’s just a muscular thing. My back feels fine, it’s just a muscle on the side. I think it will go away in a short period of time. I don’t think it’s anything serious.” However, Mickelson said he would consider withdrawing from the event if his muscle pain did not respond sufficiently to treatment over the next 24 hours.

Ocwen agreed to follow the mortgage servicing rules, such as ending robo-signing and other practices, to get the regulator’s approval to purchase Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s Litton Loan Servicing unit in September 2011. The rapid rise of specialty servicers like Ocwen has drawn the attention of state regulators, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, who wonder whether such companies have the systems in place to collect mortgage payments in large volumes. A spokesman for Wells Fargo declined to comment. A representative for Ocwen did not immediately return a request for comment. News of the New York superintendent’s action was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

862,WFC,RPT-INSIGHT-Wells Fargo edges back into subprime as U.S. mortgage market thaws,"By Peter Rudegeair and Michelle Conlin Feb 14 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, is tiptoeing back into subprime home loans again. The bank is looking for opportunities to stem its revenue decline as overall mortgage lending volume plunges. It believes it has worked through enough of its crisis-era mortgage problems, particularly with U.S. home loan agencies, to be comfortable extending credit to some borrowers with higher credit risks. The small steps from Wells Fargo could amount to a big change for the mortgage market. After the subprime mortgage bust brought the banking system to the brink of collapse in the financial crisis, banks have shied away from making home loans to anyone but the safest of consumers. Any loosening of credit standards could boost housing demand from borrowers who have been forced to sit out the recovery in home prices in the past couple of years, but could also stoke fears that U.S. lenders will make the same mistakes that had triggered the crisis. So far few other big banks seem poised to follow Wells Fargo’s lead, but some smaller companies outside the banking system, such as Citadel Servicing Corp, are already ramping up their subprime lending. To avoid the taint associated with the word “subprime,” lenders are calling their loans “another chance mortgages” or “alternative mortgage programs.” And lenders say they are much stricter about the loans than before the crisis, when lending standards were so lax that many borrowers did not have to provide any proof of income. Borrowers must often make high down payments and provide detailed information about income, work histories and bill payments. Wells Fargo in recent weeks started targeting customers that can meet strict criteria, including demonstrating their ability to repay the loan and having a documented and reasonable explanation for why their credit scores are subprime. It is looking at customers with credit scores as low as 600. Its prior limit was 640, which is often seen as the cutoff point between prime and subprime borrowers. U.S. credit scores range from 300 to 850. Lenders remain cautious in part because of financial reform rules. Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, mortgage borrowers must meet eight strict criteria including earning enough income and having relatively low debt. If the borrower does not meet those hurdles and later defaults on a mortgage, he or she can sue the lender and argue the loan should never have been made in the first place. Those kinds of rules have helped build a wall between prime and subprime borrowers. Lenders have been courting consumers who are legally easier to serve, and avoiding those with weaker credit scores and other problems. Subprime borrowers accounted for 0.3 percent of new home loans in October 2013, compared with an average of 29 percent for the 12 months ended February 2004, according to Mark Fleming, the chief economist of CoreLogic. With Wells Fargo looking at loans to borrowers with weaker credit, “we believe the wall has begun to come down,” wrote Paul Miller, a bank analyst at FBR Capital Markets, in a research note. Lenders have an ample incentive to try reaching further down the credit spectrum now. Rising mortgage rates since the middle of last year are expected to reduce total U.S. mortgage lending in 2014 by 36 percent to $1.12 trillion, the Mortgage Bankers Association forecasts, due to a big drop in refinancings. Some subprime lending can help banks, but it may also help the economy. In September 2012, then Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said housing had been the missing piston in the U.S. recovery. A recent report from think tank the Urban Institute and Moody’s Analytics argued that a full recovery in the housing market “will only happen if there is stronger demand from first-time homebuyers. And we will not see the demand needed among this group if access to mortgage credit remains as tight as it is today.” Subprime mortgages were at the center of the financial crisis, but many lenders believe that done with proper controls, the risks can be managed and the business can generate big profits. For Wells Fargo, one of the critical factors in the new strategy was its clearing up of disputes with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said Franklin Codel, Wells Fargo’s head of mortgage production in Des Moines, Iowa. The 2013 settlements for $1.3 billion resolved a few battles in a half-decade war between banks and government mortgage agencies over who was responsible for losses from the mortgage crisis. The bank still has mortgage problems to clear up with the agencies, including a lawsuit linked to the Federal Housing Administration, but Wells Fargo officials believe the worst is over. Wells Fargo avoided many of the worst loans of the subprime era: It did not offer option adjustable-rate mortgages, for instance. But when it acquired Wachovia in 2008, the bank inherited a $120 billion portfolio of “Pick-A-Pay” mortgages where borrowers could defer payments on their loans. Those loans have suffered big losses. One of the reasons for banks being so cautious in mortgage lending now is that Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and the FHA have been pressing lenders to buy back home loans that went bad after the crisis. The agencies guaranteed the loans, and argued that the banks overstated the mortgages’ quality, or made mistakes like omitting required documents. Banks feel that the agencies were using trivial mistakes as a club to pressure banks to buy back loans. But after its settlements, Wells Fargo is more confident about the underwriting flaws the agencies consider material and the quality of the documentation needed to avoid such costly battles. “As things become clearer and we are more comfortable with our own processes and controls, it gets easier” to extend more credit, Codel said. Still, Wells Fargo isn’t just opening up the spigots. The bank is looking to lend to borrowers with weaker credit, but only if those mortgages can be guaranteed by the FHA, Codel said. Because the loans are backed by the government, Wells Fargo can package them into bonds and sell them to investors. The funding of the loans is a key difference between Wells Fargo and other lenders: the big bank is packaging them into bonds and selling them to investors, but many of the smaller, nonbank lenders are making mortgages known as “nonqualified loans” that they are often holding on their books. Citadel Servicing Corp, the country’s biggest subprime lender, is trying to change that. It plans to package the loans it has made into bonds and sell them to investors. Citadel has lent money to people with credit scores as low as 490 - though they have to pay interest rates above 10 percent, far above the roughly 4.3 percent that prime borrowers pay now. As conditions ease, borrowers are taking notice. Gary Goldberg, a 63-year-old automotive detailer, was denied loans to buy a house near Rancho Cucamonga, California. Last summer he was forced to move into a trailer park in Las Vegas. Going from 2,000 square feet to 200 - along with his wife and two German shepherd dogs - was tough. He longed to buy a house. But a post-crash bankruptcy of his detailing business had torched his credit, taking his score from the 800s to the 500s. “There was no way I was going to get a mortgage,” said Goldberg. “No bank would touch me.” But in December, he moved into a 1,000-square-foot one-story home that he paid $205,000 for. His lender, Premiere Mortgage Lending, did not care about his bankruptcy or his subprime credit score. That is because Goldberg had a 30 percent down payment and was willing to pay an 8.9 percent interest rate. To be sure, credit is still only trickling down to subprime borrowers. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of the second-largest U.S. mortgage lender JPMorgan Chase & Co, said on a conference call last month that he did not envision a “dramatic expansion” of mortgage credit because of a continued lack of clarity from the government agencies on their repurchase demands. But smaller, non-bank lenders are making more loans. One such company, ACC Mortgage in Maryland, is offering a “Low Credit Score Debt Consolidation Program” as well as a “Second Chance Purchase Program.” Low credit scores don’t matter. Neither do bankruptcies, foreclosures or short sales. “I think that is going to be the wave of the future, basically making non-prime mortgages, carving that out into a profitable niche,” said Guy Cecala, publisher of newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance. “Right now we’re at the infant stage.”",2142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/banks-subprime/rpt-insight-wells-fargo-edges-back-into-subprime-as-u-s-mortgage-market-thaws-idUSL2N0LI2DU20140214

865,WFC,WRAPUP 1-More weak U.S. economic data puts cracks in weather theory,"WASHINGTON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilder confidence suffered its largest one-month drop ever in February, heightening concerns that recent signs of weakness in the economy reflect deeper problems than the severe weather that has gripped much of the country. The National Association of Home Builders said on Tuesday its Housing Market Index plunged by 10 points to 46 in February , with a majority of builders seeing market conditions as poor. The NAHB, which produces the index together with U.S. bank Wells Fargo, said cold temperatures kept potential home buyers out of the market across much of the country. But the trade group said high costs were also holding back the housing industry, and the data adds to worries the U.S. economy might actually be loosing momentum following a year of break-out growth. Poor weather usually drags on growth only temporarily as businesses and consumers put off purchases. If the recent slowdown in the economy is weather related, economists expect that the trend will reverse once temperatures turn higher and spur consumers to get back to spending. “This report will keep alive concerns in the markets that the weakening in the data recently is not just due to weather,” said Jim O’Sullivan, an economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. Worries over the outlook for the economy have grown since reports showed weak hiring across the economy in December and January, when much of the country experienced unusually frigid temperatures. Now signs of economic weakness are persisting into February. Another report on Tuesday showed a gauge of manufacturing in New York state slowed in February. The New York Federal Reserve Bank’s Empire State general business conditions index fell to 4.48 from 12.51 the month before, which was a 20-month high. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 9.0. The survey of manufacturing plants in New York state is one of the earliest monthly guideposts to U.S. factory conditions. Investors were caught off guard by the NAHB report, which marked the first time since May that the reading was below the key 50 mark. Readings below 50 mean more builders view market conditions as poor than favorable. The Dow Jones index of housing stocks fell 0.7 percent following the release of the data. All three of the home builders in the S&P; 500 index — Lennar Corp., PulteGroup Inc. and D.R. Horton Inc. — were more than 1 percent lower. More broadly, prices for U.S. stocks and yields on government debt were little changed. The U.S. housing market has been cooling over much of the last year as the Federal Reserve prepared to wind down its bond-buying stimulus program. Expectations the program would come to an end have pushed borrowing costs higher. Builders also are concerned that the industry can’t keep up with demand. While this points to some underlying health in the sector, it also is a factor limiting the supply of homes, which helps push up prices and could put home out of reach for some buyers. “Clearly, constraints on the supply chain for building materials, developed lots and skilled workers are making builders worry,” the NAHB’s chief economist, David Crowe, said in the statement from the group. “The weather also hurt retail     and auto sales and this had a contributing effect on demand for new homes.”",2182014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy/wrapup-1-more-weak-u-s-economic-data-puts-cracks-in-weather-theory-idUSL2N0LN0Y620140218
866,WFC,Veteran Pennsylvania Wells Fargo brokers go independent,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A family brokerage team who had been at Wells Fargo Advisors for more than a decade and manage more than $300 million of assets for wealthy clients resigned on Wednesday to start an independent registered investment advisory firm. Gerald Strid, his sons Erik and Paul and two other brokers folded the Strid Wealth Management Group at Wells’ Berwyn, Pennsylvania, branch to form Concentus Wealth Advisors in King of Prussia. The group offers planning services and has discretion to select investment managers for about 150 wealthy families. They plan to continue requiring clients to have a minimum of $1 million of assets and plan to start a family office with a higher minimum. “We were already a long way to feeling independent but we got to the point where it was time to take the last step and be totally objective and transparent (about the practice),” said Erik Strid, who joined his father’s team in 1992 when they were at Merrill Lynch. “There were certain instances where there was a shadow of doubt in clients’ minds about where the ‘vig’ was for the bank,” he said, using a gambling term for interest kept by the house or lender. The Strids also wanted more equity in their practice and to be less tied to long-term bank stock incentives whose value they cannot control. Despite some incentives that bank-owned brokerage firms give advisers to sell products, the Strid team was successful enough to do what was best for clients without bank interference and benefited from Wells’ vast resources, said Erik Strid. Wells Fargo Advisors is a broker-dealer subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Co., the fourth-biggest U.S. bank company. The Strids are part of a small but growing trend of traditional stockbrokers who are becoming independent advisers, typically offering fee-based investment accounts and broad financial planning services. The number of wealth managers who registered as investment advisers grew at an annual rate of 8 percent between 2004 and 2012, while brokers at traditional firms fell an average of 1.2 percent in those years, according to Cerulli Associates, a Boston-based wealth management consulting firm. To help structure their new business, including creating an equity structure to help them expand, the Strids have affiliated with Dynasty Financial Partners, a New York firm founded by former Smith Barney and Citigroup executives that designs technology and investment products for independent advisers. Dynasty helps manage 20 independent wealth management firms with 63 advisers and about $20 billion in assets. It charges a small percentage of the non-cash assets managed by its advisory firms. Concentus, Latin for “harmony,” is using Charles Schwab Corp to hold client assets and execute transactions. The group will continue to buy research and tactical strategies from Dorsey Wright & Associates, a Richmond, Virginia-based “technical” money manager. It will retain web-based financial planning software from eMoney Advisor, and use Envestnet’s reporting and portfolio balancing tools. The Strids were part of a small unit at Wells called “Profit Formula” that allows brokers to keep about 75 percent of the revenue they collect from clients but charges them for the costs of running their practices. Most big brokerage firms pay top brokers about 45 percent of the commissions and fees collected from clients, but provide overhead and other services gratis. Wells is not allowing new advisers into Profit Formula, said brokerage spokeswoman Rachelle Rowe, because it has separate “channels” to accommodate those who want to be completely independent and others who are full-time employees. Many of the most successful of Wells’ more than 15,000 retail brokers are in Profit Formula and tend to move less often, she added.

867,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Veteran Pennsylvania Wells Fargo brokers go independent,"NEW YORK, Feb 20 (Reuters) - A family brokerage team who had been at Wells Fargo Advisors for more than a decade and manage more than $300 million of assets for wealthy clients resigned on Wednesday to start an independent registered investment advisory firm. Gerald Strid, his sons Erik and Paul and two other brokers folded the Strid Wealth Management Group at Wells’ Berwyn, Pennsylvania, branch to form Concentus Wealth Advisors in King of Prussia. The group offers planning services and has discretion to select investment managers for about 150 wealthy families. They plan to continue requiring clients to have a minimum of $1 million of assets and plan to start a family office with a higher minimum. “We were already a long way to feeling independent but we got to the point where it was time to take the last step and be totally objective and transparent (about the practice),” said Erik Strid, who joined his father’s team in 1992 when they were at Merrill Lynch. “There were certain instances where there was a shadow of doubt in clients’ minds about where the ‘vig’ was for the bank,” he said, using a gambling term for interest kept by the house or lender. The Strids also wanted more equity in their practice and to be less tied to long-term bank stock incentives whose value they cannot control. Despite some incentives that bank-owned brokerage firms give advisers to sell products, the Strid team was successful enough to do what was best for clients without bank interference and benefited from Wells’ vast resources, said Erik Strid. Wells Fargo Advisors is a broker-dealer subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Co., the fourth-biggest U.S. bank company. The Strids are part of a small but growing trend of traditional stockbrokers who are becoming independent advisers, typically offering fee-based investment accounts and broad financial planning services. The number of wealth managers who registered as investment advisers grew at an annual rate of 8 percent between 2004 and 2012, while brokers at traditional firms fell an average of 1.2 percent in those years, according to Cerulli Associates, a Boston-based wealth management consulting firm. To help structure their new business, including creating an equity structure to help them expand, the Strids have affiliated with Dynasty Financial Partners, a New York firm founded by former Smith Barney and Citigroup executives that designs technology and investment products for independent advisers. Dynasty helps manage 20 independent wealth management firms with 63 advisers and about $20 billion in assets. It charges a small percentage of the non-cash assets managed by its advisory firms. Concentus, Latin for “harmony,” is using Charles Schwab Corp  to hold client assets and execute transactions. The group will continue to buy research and tactical strategies from Dorsey Wright & Associates, a Richmond, Virginia-based “technical” money manager. It will retain web-based financial planning software from eMoney Advisor, and use Envestnet’s  reporting and portfolio balancing tools. The Strids were part of a small unit at Wells called “Profit Formula” that allows brokers to keep about 75 percent of the revenue they collect from clients but charges them for the costs of running their practices. Most big brokerage firms pay top brokers about 45 percent of the commissions and fees collected from clients, but provide overhead and other services gratis. Wells is not allowing new advisers into Profit Formula, said brokerage spokeswoman Rachelle Rowe, because it has separate “channels” to accommodate those who want to be completely independent and others who are full-time employees. Many of the most successful of Wells’ more than 15,000 retail brokers are in Profit Formula and tend to move less often, she added. The bank is likely restricting growth of Profit Formula to maintain better risk control, since advisers in the unit have more latitude to manage clients’ money, or for reasons related to profit margin but the Strids did not feel pinched by any changes, Erik Strid said. The spokeswoman declined to comment on the Strids or on the number of Profit Formula advisers.

876,WFC,UPDATE 1-Nationstar Mortgage comes under scrutiny of New York regulator,"By Karen Freifeld and Peter Rudegeair NEW YORK, March 5 (Reuters) - New York state’s banking regulator on Wednesday requested information from Nationstar Mortgage LLC about its portfolio and mortgage servicing practices, saying that it has received hundreds of complaints from consumers as Nationstar’s business has seen explosive growth. Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York’s Department of Financial Services, sent a letter to Nationstar’s chief executive, Jesse Bray, saying the agency had “significant concerns” that the growth of Nationstar and other non-bank mortgage servicers may “create capacity issues that put homeowners at risk.” Lawsky recently expressed similar concerns about Ocwen Financial Corp, the largest non-bank mortgage servicer, halting the company’s purchase of servicing rights from Wells Fargo & Co  last month. In Wednesday’s letter, Lawsky said Nationstar’s portfolio of loans serviced more than doubled from $126.5 billion of unpaid principal at the end of 2012 to $283.3 billion at the end of 2013. Nationstar collects payments on more than one out of every 25 U.S. home loans. “We have received hundreds of complaints ... about your company’s mortgage practices,” Lawsky wrote, related to mortgage modifications, improper fees, lost paperwork and other matters. The letter requested a breakdown of the portfolio, the number of staff in each business unit and the volume of transactions per employee. It asked for acquisitions of servicing rights in the pipeline as well as rights purchased in excess of $1 billion since January 2013. Lawsky also asked for policies, practices and other loan information. In a statement, Nationstar’s Bray said, “We have a proven track record of helping homeowners succeed and avoid foreclosure, and we welcome the opportunity to share this information with the New York Department of Financial Services.” Bray added that the company intends to comply “fully and transparently” with Lawsky’s letter. Last year, housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac expressed concerns about Nationstar’s buying servicing rights to $122 billion of mortgage loans, after winning rights to a separate $215 billion mortgage portfolio, according to people familiar with the matter. Ally Financial, the seller of the mortgages, ended up selling most of the portfolio to Ocwen. Nationstar is the fifth largest U.S. mortgage servicer, behind Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Ocwen, according to industry publication Inside Mortgage Finance. Other non-bank servicers among the top 10 include PHH Mortgage and Walter Investment Management. Lawsky urged regulators in a February speech to halt the growth of these kinds of specialty servicers when doing so would protect homeowners from getting hurt. Bray said in a February 27 conference call with analysts that the current regulatory environment will slow the approval process for adding to his company’s servicing load. “I think it’s clearly going to take more time. And it’s clearly going to be a more involved process,” Bray said on the call. Nationstar shares were down 2.57 percent at $30.28 in afternoon trading.",3052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/mortgages-new-york/update-1-nationstar-mortgage-comes-under-scrutiny-of-new-york-regulator-idUSL1N0M21VP20140305

885,WFC,Watchdog: U.S. banks' relief to borrowers exceed terms of 2012 deal,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. banks including Bank of America Corp and Citigroup provided more than the $19 billion in help to struggling borrowers they were required to offer under a landmark 2012 deal with the U.S. government, a watchdog said on Tuesday. Bank of America, for example, cut loan balances and helped homeowners in other ways that added up to $9.6 billion in relief, even though the bank was only obligated to provide around $8.6 billion in such aid under the settlement, the monitor of the deal said in a report. “I will say, as we have come to the end of all of this, I am satisfied and actually, happy,” Joseph Smith, the person assigned to monitor banks’ compliance with the settlement terms, said of the value of the mortgage debt the banks agreed to reduce for distressed borrowers. The obligations stem from a $25 billion deal between federal and state authorities and five top mortgage servicers, announced in February 2012 and designed to end foreclosure abuses. The other banks on the deal are JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo & Co and Residential Capital LLC. The report marks the end of the consumer relief portion of the settlement. The rest of the funds were paid to foreclosed borrowers and as cash to the states and the federal government. The banks are still being monitored over their compliance with a third portion of the deal that subjected them to new standards for servicing mortgages. At the time the deal was announced, top U.S. officials said it could help 1 million borrowers, and President Barack Obama said it could help turn the page on the housing crisis. But critics said the complicated structure of crediting the banks’ efforts to aid consumers could allow the banks to fulfill the settlement obligations through things they would have done anyway — waiving deficiency judgments or processing short sales, for example. Mortgage bond investors also worried they might end up shouldering many of the costs of the deal. In the first report to audit the banks’ full relief efforts under the settlement, Smith said the banks got credit for $20.7 billion in relief to borrowers. They were required to offer $19.1 billion in help under the deal, he said. The majority of that came from loans the banks themselves owned, he said. Banks only get partial credit for some things, such as short sales of homes, so the total amount of aid to borrowers was actually considerably higher, he said. Only around 600,000 families wound up receiving help, fewer than officials initially projected. But Smith said he was still satisfied with the extent to which banks cut borrowers’ loan balances. “I viewed our goal as to providing...neutral facts on the basis of which this discussion about dealing with distressed loans could continue,” Smith said of his report. “We now have a complete picture of what actually happened,” he said. In statements, Wells Fargo and Bank of America said they were pleased to have provided the relief to customers and have continued to give assistance. JPMorgan said it was proud of its efforts and is investing in improving its customer experience. A Citi representative said the bank was pleased Smith found it had fulfilled its consumer relief obligations under the deal. Smith had previously certified that ResCap, which was put through bankruptcy and whose servicing business is now owned by Ocwen Financial Corp, had completed its consumer relief obligations under the deal. When the deal was announced in 2012, investors in mortgage backed securities worried that many of the mortgages modified were those they ultimately owned, since the banks could get credit for loans they serviced on behalf of others. In fact, the vast majority of all the banks’ credit came from addressing loans they owned themselves, Smith said. For Wells Fargo and Citi, that number stood at more than 99 percent. Bank of America earned the most credit from loans it serviced for others - around 39 percent, according to Smith’s report. JPMorgan earned around 29 percent of its credit from loans it serviced on behalf of other investors.

At the time, she named Joe Nadreau, 43, to run innovation and business strategy and said the products role would be filled soon. Mack, who became president of the Wells Fargo & Co broker-dealer subsidiary in January following the retirement of long-time brokerage head Danny Ludeman, also plans to name an executive to head a new Mobile and Online Group, a spokeswoman said. Mack previously ran the combined unit at Wells Advisors, which is the third-largest brokerage firm in the United States, as measured by number of financial advisers. Vorlop, 56, oversees brokers’ sale of loans and other banking products, an area of growing importance as bank-owned brokers such as Wells, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS Wealth Management Americas attempt to sell products of their parent companies in addition to investment products. His group also oversees investment services and recruiting of brokers and branch managers. Vorlop, who has been with Wells Fargo and predecessor brokerage firms such as Wachovia Securities for 30 years, had most recently run investment and advisory products. Nadreau’s innovation and business strategy group creates and manages processes and platforms that brokers use. Nadreau and Vorlop also have joined the broker-dealer’s executive committee. Like its competitors, Wells Fargo has been pouring money into new technology to make its products and services more accessible to clients and brokers. Wells’ brokerage group has grown through a series of acquisitions that left it with numerous systems and workstations that did not always communicate effectively. In an internal email to brokers last month, David Kowach, president of the branch-based private client group, said he has heard their complaints about poor technology and inefficient services and is addressing them. Improvements range from new scanners in all branches that he promised will eliminate “the frustration and inefficiency” of using faxes for service request for things like issuing checks and moving money to an upgrade of brokers’ computer workstations to allow them to simultaneously see accounts of multiple clients. Wells next quarter will roll out an iPad application that will let advisers access relevant client information remotely for in-person visits. Kowach also promised that in late 2014 or early 2015, Wells will roll out a “360 Degree View of the Client” that allows brokers to see in a single location what clients own across all their accounts, all relevant information about their goals and other crucial information. “Today our client information is all over the place - and that’s been a big point of frustration that I’ve heard from you,” Kowach wrote in the memo seen by Reuters. “Through the years, we’ve essentially quilted together a lot of different systems.” ",3192014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-executive-changes/wells-advisors-names-vorlop-to-products-post-vows-tech-advances-idUSBREA2I1RF20140319

890,WFC,"Fitch Affirms Support Ratings and Support Rating Floors for BNY Mellon, State Street and Wells Fargo","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Support Ratings (SRs)  and Support Rating Floors (SRFs) at '1' and 'A', respectively, for Bank of New  York Mellon Corporation (BK), State Street Corporation (STT), and Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC). The rating actions have been taken in conjunction with a review  of support for banks globally.  BK's, STT's, and WFC's IDRs do not currently incorporate any government support,  and reflect their standalone strengths only. As such, absent a material in  change economic conditions or the companies' stand-alone credit profiles, a  future change to their SRs or SRFs will have no impact on the companies' IDRs. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS BK's, STT's, and WFC's current SRs and SRFs reflect Fitch's expectation that  there remains an extremely high probability of support from the U.S. government  (rated 'AAA', Rating Outlook Stable) if required. This expectation reflects the  U.S.'s extremely high ability to support its banks especially given its strong  financial flexibility, though propensity is becoming less certain. Specific to  BK, STT, and WFC, our view of support likelihood is based mostly on their  systemic importance in the U.S., their global interconnectedness given their  size and operations in global capital markets, significant deposit market share  and their positions as key providers of financial services to the U.S. economy.  BK's, STT's, and WFC's IDRs and senior debt ratings do not benefit from support  because their VRs are all above their SRF. However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce support for  G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and progress  regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA).  The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy and further  initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to eliminate state  support for U.S. banks going forward, which increases the likelihood of senior  debt losses if its banks run afoul of solvency assessments. RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATINGS AND SUPPORT RATING FLOORS The SRs and SRFs are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy  and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs,  including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of  continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the  feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA  passed). Hurdles that remain include the resolution of how cross-border  derivative acceleration/termination provisions are handled and that there is  sufficient contingent capital at the holding company to recapitalize without  requiring government assistance. Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but regardless of its  finalization, Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues to be  made over the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to revise BK's,  STT's, and WFC's SRs to '5' and SRFs to 'No Floor' within the next one to two  years, likely to be some point in late 2014 or in 1H15. Absent a material in change economic conditions or the companies' stand-alone  credit profiles, a revision of the SRFs to 'No Floor' would mean no change to  BK's, STT's, or WFC's Long-term IDRs and debt ratings because their viability  ratings are all above their SRFs. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings. All other ratings are unaffected.

891,WFC,UPDATE 1-U.S. SEC inches closer to money market fund final rule,"(Adds more details throughout about the SEC’s money market fund plan) By Sarah N. Lynch March 26 (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators are inching closer to completing new rules for money market funds, though no final decision on how to proceed has been made just yet, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Securities and Exchange Commission staff in charge of the rulewriting has been meeting with the agency’s five commissioners, circulating some documents that highlight potential courses of actions and sounding them out to get their thoughts, the person said. The SEC is still actively eyeing a plan that would force prime institutional money market funds to abandon their stable $1 per-share net asset value and float their share price. In response to some complaints from the industry, the SEC is also exploring whether to make some changes from its initial proposal that could effectively expand the number of money market funds that would be exempt from a floating net asset value, the person added. The SEC has been exploring ways to reform the $2.6 trillion money market fund industry as a direct response to the financial crisis. In 2008, exposures to Lehman Brothers caused a large prime institutional fund known as the Reserve Primary Fund to have its net asset value dip below $1, an event known as “breaking the buck.” Spooked investors rushed to get their money out, and the U.S. government ultimately stepped in to prop up the money market fund industry until the panic subsided. The SEC’s proposal, first released last summer, is aimed at preventing similar runs. In addition to proposing a floating NAV for prime funds, the plan also contemplates an alternative which would permit fund boards to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates during times of stress. The SEC could potentially adopt one of the two options alone or in combination. The source added that the proposal for gates and fees are also still on the table as well. Earlier this week, the SEC released four new economic analyses on money market funds that it is using to help inform a final rule and asked the public to submit feedback on the studies. SEC Republican Commissioner Michael Piwowar said on Wednesday that he is advocating internally for the SEC to allow funds to choose which option they prefer. “My idea is, rather than us choosing for everybody, why don’t we allow for both options to be offered and then investors can choose which one they want?” Piwowar said on the sidelines of an SEC event. “I call it the investor choice model, or the belts or suspenders model,” he added. It is unclear if his idea could gain traction. A majority of the five commissioners must agree before a rule can be adopted. As part of the SEC’s internal discussions, staff is discussing making changes that would broaden an exemption for retail money market funds from having to float their share price. Retail funds were always supposed to be exempted from the floating NAV plan because they are considered less at risk for runs. But many in the industry have said that how the SEC defined retail is problematic. In October, nine fund management companies including Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard and Wells Fargo  proposed an alternative definition of retail. Under the SEC’s plan, a fund would be considered retail if it prohibits a shareholder from redeeming more than $1 million per business day. The nine companies have urged the SEC to instead define a retail fund as one that “limits beneficial ownership interest to natural persons” such as individuals who are investing in money funds through individual accounts or retirement accounts. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the SEC’s internal deliberations concerning broadening the retail exemption.   (Reporting by Sarah N.

892,WFC,Wells Fargo extends credit card push in deal with Dillard's,"April 1 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Tuesday that it agreed to issue and service credit cards for retailer Dillard’s Inc, the latest move by the fourth-largest U.S. bank to boost its card business. Under a 10-year agreement likely to begin in the fourth quarter of 2014, Wells Fargo will offer private label and co-branded credit cards on behalf of Dillard’s, taking over from General Electric Co’s consumer finance unit. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Expanding the size of Wells Fargo’s credit card business has been a priority for top executives, who have focused on getting more of their existing retail customers to open accounts and use their cards more frequently. The bank has some success to show for it: 37 percent of its retail households had a Wells Fargo credit card at the end of 2013, compared with 27 percent at the end of 2011. But the deal with Dillard’s, a Little Rock, Arkansas-based department store operator with fiscal 2014 revenue of about $6.7 billion, illustrates that the bank can also use its relationships with existing commercial customers to boost that division. Dillard’s is a large banking customer of Wells Fargo, and issuing cards branded for specific retailers who do other business with the bank is a natural way for the credit card unit to expand, said Tom Wolfe, Wells Fargo’s executive vice president for consumer credit solutions. The San Francisco-based bank has lagged rivals like Citigroup Inc. and Capital One Financial Corp in issuing these private label cards, according to data from the Nilson Report, an industry publication. But Wells Fargo hopes to win more of this business in the future. “This is one area that we’d like to spend some more time expanding,” Wolfe said. Wells Fargo is not alone in wanting to boost its private label business. GE’s consumer finance unit, part of which filed for an initial public offering in March under the name Synchrony Financial, said in a March 13 securities filing that “the competition for partners is intense and becoming more competitive.” Synchrony listed Wells Fargo as one of its primary competitors in the private label credit card business. Another area that Wells Fargo has identified as one where it is “clearly underrepresented” in credit cards is among the affluent. The bank announced a partnership with American Express Co  in August to provide more competitive rewards and benefits to wealthy consumers. A full-scale launch of those products is set to occur in the first half of 2014.

893,WFC,Wells Fargo fails to end lawsuit over WestLB CDO vehicle,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a lawsuit accusing it of mismanaging a collateralized debt obligation vehicle created by WestLB AG, a state-owned German bank that was dissolved after the 2008 financial crisis. While dismissing several claims, U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan said Wells Fargo must face claims by House of Europe Funding I Ltd, a Cayman Islands-based CDO issuer, that its oversight led to losses that could reach $163 million. The decision was made public on Tuesday, and is dated March 31. Created by WestLB in 2003, House of Europe accused Wells Fargo, as trustee and collateral administrator, and Collineo Asset Management GmbH, a German asset manager, of taking too much risk by allowing it to invest excessively in other kinds of CDOs at least six times from April 2006 to July 2007. According to the complaint, most of the disputed assets have defaulted, causing $143 million of losses and $20 million of expected future losses for House of Europe and its investors. Erste Abwicklungsanstalt (EAA), a German agency created to wind down WestLB, was also a plaintiff. Sullivan ruled that House of Europe’s allegations sufficed to allow a breach of contract claim against Wells Fargo. He also said that allegations that Wells Fargo concealed the true nature of the investments by misreporting them supported an inference at this stage of the case that the San Francisco-based bank might have acted with “gross negligence.” Sullivan also allowed House of Europe to pursue part of its case against Collineo, and dismissed much of EAA’s case. The lawsuit was filed in January 2013. Jonathan Pickhardt, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan representing House of Europe and EAA, said: “We are pleased that the court upheld our central claim seeking to hold Wells Fargo responsible for its repeated breaches of provisions intended to protect House of Europe I and its investors.” Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez declined to comment. The bank is the fourth-largest in the United States by assets. Demian Ordway, a lawyer at Holwell Shuster & Goldberg representing Collineo, said: “We’re very happy with the result, and are confident that HOE’s remaining claim against Collineo will ultimately be dismissed.” WestLB ceased operations in 2012.

894,WFC,"Wells Fargo appoints new CFO, wholesale banking head","(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co on Tuesday named a new chief financial officer and wholesale banking leader, in a shake-up of its top ranks. Dave Hoyt, Wells Fargo’s current head of wholesale banking, will leave the bank at the end of June after a 32-year career. He will be succeeded by Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan. The bank’s wholesale banking group provides lending and services such as treasury management and insurance to businesses with annual sales in excess of $20 million. Taking over Sloan’s role will be John Shrewsberry, the head of Wells Fargo Securities, a division within wholesale banking that includes the bank’s capital markets, sales and trading, and investment banking businesses. “Today’s appointments represent a natural evolution of executive responsibilities at our company,” said Chief Executive John Stumpf in a news release. “They also demonstrate the deep bench of high-caliber leaders at Wells Fargo and the value of rotating them into different roles to effect seamless leadership transitions.” The bank declined to make Hoyt, Sloan or Shrewsberry available for interviews. Hoyt, 58, managed the wholesale banking group for 16 years and oversaw much of the 2008 integration following Wells Fargo’s acquisition of Wachovia. Certain executives, including members of the bank’s operating committee like Hoyt, have a mandatory retirement age of 65. Hoyt said in the release that he was retiring “confident... our wholesale banking customers are in excellent hands.” He will leave the bank excited about pursuing hobbies and having more time to spend with his family, a spokeswoman said. In their new positions Shrewsberry, 48, and Sloan, 53, will report to Stumpf and serve on the bank’s operating committee. For Sloan, the transition marks a return to his roots at the company. He spent 22 of his 26 years at Wells Fargo in the wholesale banking group, including stints as head of commercial banking and commercial real estate. Shrewsberry’s appointment to the CFO post was more unexpected, Sandler O’Neill bank analyst R. Scott Siefers wrote in a Tuesday research note, though he added he was “highly confident will be able to slide into the role quite easily” given the company’s previous success transitioning executives. Wells Fargo reported a record annual profit of $21.9 billion in 2013. Wholesale banking brought in $24.1 billion in revenues last year, around 29 percent of the company total, and accounted for $8.1 billion in profits, around 37 percent of the total. The bank does not separately break out the performance figures for Wells Fargo Securities. Additionally, it has yet to appoint a successor to Shrewsberry at Wells Fargo Securities. Shares in the fourth-largest U.S. bank have risen 9.56 percent since the start of 2014, more than double the 4.37 percent increase in the KBW index of bank stocks over the same period.

899,WFC,Wells Fargo extends credit card push in deal with Dillard's,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) said on Tuesday that it agreed to issue and service credit cards for retailer Dillard’s Inc (DDS.N), the latest move by the fourth-largest U.S. bank to boost its card business. Under a 10-year agreement likely to begin in the fourth quarter of 2014, Wells Fargo will offer private label and co-branded credit cards on behalf of Dillard’s, taking over from General Electric Co’s (GE.N) consumer finance unit. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Expanding the size of Wells Fargo’s credit card business has been a priority for top executives, who have focused on getting more of their existing retail customers to open accounts and use their cards more frequently. The bank has some success to show for it: 37 percent of its retail households had a Wells Fargo credit card at the end of 2013, compared with 27 percent at the end of 2011. But the deal with Dillard’s, a Little Rock, Arkansas-based department store operator with fiscal 2014 revenue of about $6.7 billion, illustrates that the bank can also use its relationships with existing commercial customers to boost that division. Dillard’s is a large banking customer of Wells Fargo, and issuing cards branded for specific retailers who do other business with the bank is a natural way for the credit card unit to expand, said Tom Wolfe, Wells Fargo’s executive vice president for consumer credit solutions. The San Francisco-based bank has lagged rivals like Citigroup Inc. (C.N) and Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) in issuing these private label cards, according to data from the Nilson Report, an industry publication. But Wells Fargo hopes to win more of this business in the future. “This is one area that we’d like to spend some more time expanding,” Wolfe said. Wells Fargo is not alone in wanting to boost its private label business. GE’s consumer finance unit, part of which filed for an initial public offering in March under the name Synchrony Financial, said in a March 13 securities filing that “the competition for partners is intense and becoming more competitive.” Synchrony listed Wells Fargo as one of its primary competitors in the private label credit card business. Another area that Wells Fargo has identified as one where it is “clearly underrepresented” in credit cards is among the affluent. The bank announced a partnership with American Express Co (AXP.N) in August to provide more competitive rewards and benefits to wealthy consumers. A full-scale launch of those products is set to occur in the first half of 2014.

902,WFC,Fitch: Wells Fargo's 1Q'14 Results Show Solid and Resilient Net Income,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 11 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) has reported another  quarter of record earnings, with net income up 5% sequentially in 1Q'14. The  results are impressive, according to Fitch Ratings, given the low interest rate  environment and still tenuous loan demand.  Earnings were supported by lower credit costs, controlled expenses, and higher  trading results, partially offset by modest compression in spread income. The 5%  sequential improvement in earnings was primarily driven by a one-time tax  benefit. Excluding this item, Fitch estimates that adjusted ROA was  approximately 143bps during the quarter, as compared to last quarter's ROA of  148bps. Fitch views these results favorably and as consistent with WFC's credit  profile, with ratings that remain among the highest in the world.  Revenue growth remains challenging for the entire industry, and the revenues for  WFC were slightly down on a linked-quarter basis. Lower spread income,  reflecting two fewer days in the quarter, was offset by improved noninterest  income. The net interest margin (NIM) continued to contract a further 7bps in  1Q'14, reflecting weaker loan yields and a bottoming out of funding costs.  Overall noninterest income was up roughly 2% on a linked-quarter basis primarily  aided by a 41% increase in net gains on trading activities, debt securities, and  equity investments. These revenues combined with investment banking comprised a  relatively manageable 8% of total revenues in 1Q'14, the contribution of more  volatile capital markets activities that is well below some of WFC's large bank  peers. Lower services charges, mortgage revenues, and investment banking  revenues partially offset the favorable trading results.  Despite the expected and sizeable drop-off in refinancings, mortgage results  were once again resilient in 1Q'14. Mortgage originations declined a further 28%  in the quarter, roughly in line with peer results; however, total mortgage  banking noninterest income fell only 4% from the prior quarter due primarily to  higher MSR results, net of hedging. Production income declined 34%, reflecting  lower origination volumes. While mortgage banking revenues are down nearly 50%  from a year ago, it appears as though the level has stabilized or is close to  stabilizing.  Expenses were down slightly on a sequential basis. Personnel expenses were  higher in 1Q'14 reflecting seasonally higher incentive compensation and employee  benefit expenses, which more than offset by lower equipment, professional  services, and advertising expenses.  WFC reported a smaller reserve release on a sequential basis of $500 million as  compared to $600 million last quarter. Net charge-offs (NCOs) reflecting  continuing asset quality improvement, declining to just 41bps, well below WFC's  historical loss history of around 100bps. WFC expects future reserve releases,  absent a significant deterioration in economic conditions. Given relatively weak  loan demand (2% on linked-quarter annualized basis), WFC's provisioning needs  for loan growth appear relatively low at this point.  Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III Advanced Approach was solid  10.04% at quarter-end, exceeding the company's internal target of 9%. WFC's  received no objection to its capital request under CCAR, which included an  anticipated increase in the dividend to $0.35 from $0.30 per quarter and higher  anticipated share repurchases in 2014. WFC's previously disclosed total payout  ratio target is between 50% and 65% of earnings.

903,WFC,"Wells Fargo profit beats estimates, helped by one-time gains","(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, reported a higher-than-expected 14 percent rise in first-quarter net profit, as a series of cost cuts and one-time gains helped the bank offset the lowest volume of home loans it made in five-and-a-half years. The bank, the most profitable in the United States in 2013, has been hurt in recent quarters by declining demand for mortgage refinancing, as lending rates have risen. Income from mortgage banking fell by 46 percent to $1.5 billion from the same quarter last year. Wells Fargo’s new home loans fell by two-thirds to $36 billion in the quarter from $109 billion a year earlier, the lowest since the third quarter of 2008, when the housing market was under heavy stress. But a series of one-time items this quarter helped offset much of the decline in the mortgage business. Wells Fargo recorded $847 million in gains on its equity investments, about 7.5 times the $113 million it earned a year earlier. Its tax bill was also $227 million lower as it booked a $423 million benefit from resolving prior disputes with state tax authorities. Overall operating expenses fell 4 percent as it spent less on employee benefits and incentive compensation. Another boost to net income came from the bank dipping into funds set aside to cover soured loans, as the housing market and the overall economy stabilized. The bank released $500 million from these reserves, higher than the $200 million a year ago but less than the $600 million released in the fourth quarter. Without many of these one-time gains, Wells Fargo’s results would have missed Wall Street’s estimates, according to Citigroup Inc banking analyst Keith Horowitz. JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported Friday profits fell 19 percent from a year earlier thanks to weaker-than-expected bond trading and mortgage banking revenue. Wells Fargo’s shares rose 1.5 percent in afternoon trading at $48.41. JPMorgan Chase shares fell 3.3 percent to $55.48. The KBW index of bank stocks was down nearly 1 percent. Net income for Wells Fargo’s common shareholders rose to $5.60 billion, or $1.05 per share, in the quarter, from $4.93 billion, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected the bank to earn 97 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Wells always finds a way to figure it out,” said Jason Goldberg, a banking analyst at Barclays. “This is a company that consistently puts up better-than-peer results.” Chief Financial Officer Tim Sloan told Reuters that being able to benefit from occasionally outsized equity gains and tax benefits spoke to the strength of being a diversified institution with many distinct business lines. “Unless your revenue sources were exactly like the prior quarter where every business increased by same percentage, someone will say that’s not sustainable,” he said. “Every quarter has a different complexion.” There were some indications in Wells Fargo’s results that mortgage banking might be rising out of the doldrums. The bank had $27 billion of mortgage applications in the pipeline at the end of the quarter, up slightly from $25 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Chief Executive John Stumpf told analysts on a conference call that “the housing recovery remained on track and should benefit from the spring buying season.” Wells Fargo’s loan book also showed signs of life. Total lending rose 4 percent to $826.4 billion thanks to a 7 percent increase in commercial and industrial loans and an 11 percent increase in auto loans since the first quarter of 2013. At the same time, the company is experiencing historically low loan losses. Its net charge-off rate was 0.41 percent in the latest quarter, versus 0.72 percent a year ago. It lost a mere $5 million on its $381.3 billion commercial loan portfolio. Total revenue fell 3 percent to $20.6 billion from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Between $120 million and $130 million of that decline could be attributed to the first quarter having two fewer days, Sloan told analysts on the conference call. Wells Fargo’s net interest margin, a measure of the profitability of its loans, fell to 3.2 percent from 3.49 percent a year earlier and 3.27 percent in the fourth quarter. The bank received regulatory approval in March to increase its quarterly dividend to 35 cents from 30 cents and to repurchase an additional $17 billion of stock, or about 6.5 percent of the total outstanding.

905,WFC,Wells ignited first-quarter brokerage profit with managed account sales,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Strong sales of fee-based managed investment accounts by Wells Fargo & Co. brokers fueled a 41 percent jump in net income in the bank’s “Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement” unit during the first quarter. The fourth-largest U.S. bank company, which emphasizes the diversity of its business model, said Friday that growth in managed account advisory fees and other market-sensitive revenue generated $10 billion of noninterest income for Wells in the three months ending March 31. The fees, which also included trading and investment gains in the bank’s own portfolio, helped offset declines in mortgage lending. Wells is the biggest home loan lender in the U.S. The wealth businesses remain Wells Fargo’s smallest, with its $475 million of profit representing 7.8 percent of the $6.1 billion of net income from the bank’s three business segments. Community, or branch banking, generated $3.8 billion of net income in the first quarter, and profit from wholesale banking, or loans and investment banking services to corporations, was $1.7 billion. Like Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch, UBS Wealth Management Americas and other brokerage firms owned by big banks, Wells Fargo Advisors has been urging brokers to sell loans, insurance and other bank products and services to supplement traditional investment products. The average Wells Fargo wealth sector client had 10.4 products or services from the bank as of the end of February, a greater “cross-sell” rate than in any other sector of the bank. Bank-owned brokerages also have been urging brokers to convert more clients to fee accounts, which are charged as a percentage of assets in the accounts, because they are more stable and tend to be more profitable than traditional commission-based accounts. More than 80 percent of Wells Fargo’s wealth management and brokerage revenue now come from recurring revenue such as fees, rather than unpredictable commissions, the company’s chief financial officer said on a conference call with analysts. Brokerage Loans Managed account assets at Wells Fargo Advisors soared 19 percent in the first quarter to $388 billion from a year earlier, and 4 percent from the last quarter of 2013. That beat the 1.3 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index during the first quarter, indicating that brokers actively attracted fee-based assets from existing and new customers. Client loan balances in Wells’s three wealth businesses, which also include financial planning for affluent investors and retirement services for companies and individuals, jumped 14 percent from last year to an average of $50 billion during the first quarter. Wealth sector clients also added $156 billion of low-cost deposits to their banking accounts. Improving credit quality among U.S. consumers helped Wells write down fewer loans last quarter, and seeped into the Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement unit, which focuses on loans to people with $250,000 or more to invest. It released $8 million from its reserve for credit losses to the bank’s earnings, following a $27 million release in the fourth quarter of 2013. Total client assets at the brokerage unit inched up 1 percent from last year’s fourth quarter and 8 percent from a year earlier to $1.4 trillion. Individual retirement account assets grew at a similar pace, up just 1 percent from the fourth quarter and 9 percent from a year ago in the retirement sector. Assets in the wealth unit, which focuses on millionaire clients, endowments and foundations, reached $217 trillion at March 31, up 1 percent from the fourth quarter and 6 percent from a year ago.

908,WFC,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Wells Fargo profit beats estimates, sets aside less for bad loans","(Corrects mortgage pipeline figures in paragraph 10 to $25 million, from $65 million) April 11 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, reported a better-than-expected 14 percent rise in first-quarter net profit as it set aside less money to cover bad loans. Net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $5.60 billion, or $1.05 per share, in the quarter ended March 31 from $4.93 billion, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank said on Friday. Analysts on average had expected the bank to earn 97 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wells Fargo’s shares, which had risen about 8 percent since the start of the year to Thursday’s close, were up 1 percent at $48.25 in trading before the bell. Chief Executive John Stumpf said that capital levels continued to strengthen at the fourth-biggest U.S. bank, which also cut costs in the quarter. Wells Fargo’s mortgage business, which provides nearly one in five U.S. home loans, continued to suffer from a drop in refinancing activity. Income from mortgage banking fell to $1.5 billion from $2.8 billion in the first quarter of 2013. For the week ending April 4, applications for refinancing fell to their lowest share of total mortgage applications since July 2009, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Wells Fargo’s new home loans fell to $36 billion in the quarter from $109 billion a year earlier and $50 billion in the fourth quarter. February was the worst month for new home loans since at least 2000, according to Black Knight Financial Services. Wells Fargo had $27 billion of mortgage applications in the pipeline at the end of the quarter, up from $25 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported earlier on Friday that income from its mortgage business fell to $114 million in the quarter, a drop of $559 million from the year-earlier period. Wells Fargo’s net income got a lift from a drop in the amount it set aside to cover bad loans as the housing market and the overall economy stabilized. The bank released $500 million from its loan loss reserves, higher than the $200 million released a year ago but less than the $600 million released in the fourth quarter. Wells Fargo is experiencing historically low loan losses. Its net charge-off rate was 0.41 percent in the latest quarter, down from 0.47 percent in the fourth quarter and 0.72 percent in the first quarter of 2013. Total lending rose 4 percent to $826.4 billion, while total revenue fell slightly to $20.6 billion from $21.3 billion a year earlier. Wells Fargo posted big gains from its equity investments, which earned $847 million in the quarter, about 7.5 times the $113 million it earned a year earlier. Wells Fargo’s net interest margin, a measure of the profitability of its loans, fell to 3.2 percent from 3.49 percent a year earlier and 3.27 percent in the fourth quarter. The bank received regulatory approval in March to increase its quarterly dividend to 35 cents from 30 and repurchase an additional $17 billion of stock, or about 6.5 percent of the total outstanding. Wells Fargo was one of the few big U.S. banks to emerge from the financial crisis in a stronger position, thanks in part to its acquisition of Wachovia, and its market value of about $260 billion makes it the biggest U.S. bank on that basis. JPMorgan reported a far weaker-than-expected quarterly profit as revenue from securities trading fell. Wells Fargo shares were trading a multiple of 11.60 times estimated forward earnings on Thursday, compared with a median of 12.64 for the wider banking industry.

911,WFC,Rose storms into contention at Quail Hollow,"CHARLOTTE North Carolina (Reuters) - Justin Rose’s hopes of repeating as U.S. Open champion next month got a timely boost as he moved to within a stroke of the clubhouse lead in the second round of the Wells Fargo Championship on Friday. The Englishman, who spent much of the year recovering from tendinitis in his right shoulder, showed there is little wrong with his game as he carded a five-under-par 67 on a cool morning at Quail Hollow. “Obviously you can never win it on Thursday and Friday, you can only lose it, so two solid days put me in good position for the weekend,” Rose, who will defend his U.S. Open title at nearby Pinehurst No. 2 next month, told reporters. Rose is eight-under 136 at the halfway mark while American Martin Flores (68) led on nine under after a second round that included an eagle, four birdies and a double-bogey. “Those chip-in eagles, they get you going,” Rose said, referring to a 70-footer he holed from off the green at the par-five 15th. “I did everything well in spells today (and) finished with a nice putt for par at the last hole, which made the day feel incredibly positive.” Phil Mickelson backtracked with a 75 to fall seven strokes off the pace, while overnight leader Angel Cabrera had a late tee time. World number 10 Rose has not won since notching his first major title at Merion last June, and is still playing his way back into form after being hampered by a shoulder injury that kept him sidelined for the first six weeks this year. “I’ve had a lot of stop-starts this year and I just felt like I needed to get toned and sharp, and that’s beginning to show up,” said Rose. “It would be nice to go back (to the U.S. Open) with the confidence of having just won a tournament.” Flores, who made his eagle when he holed out from 105 yards at the par-four 11th hole, has put himself in good position to record his first win on tour but refuses to look too far ahead. “I’ve tried to refuse to think about winning,” said Flores. “I just try to play my best each day and be very, very patient, because a lot of times in the past I’ve tried to be too perfect and for some reason this sport doesn’t really work out that way.” ",5022014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga/rose-storms-into-contention-at-quail-hollow-idUSKBN0DI1FJ20140502

913,WFC,Rose storms into contention at Quail Hollow,"CHARLOTTE North Carolina (Reuters) - Justin Rose’s hopes of repeating as U.S. Open champion next month got a timely boost as he moved within a stroke of the lead in the Wells Fargo Championship second round on Friday. The Englishman, who spent the first part of the year recovering from tendinitis in his right shoulder, had a chip-in eagle from 70 feet on his way to a five-under-par 67 on a cool morning at Quail Hollow. “Obviously you can never win it on Thursday and Friday, you can only lose it, so two solid days put me in good position for the weekend,” Rose, who will defend his U.S. Open title at nearby Pinehurst No. 2 next month, told reporters. Rose was in third place at eight-under 136 at the halfway mark, while Argentina’s Angel Cabrera (69) and American Martin Flores (68) set the pace at nine under. “Those chip-in eagles, they get you going,” Rose said, referring to his successful effort at the par-five 15th. “I did everything well in spells today (and) finished with a nice putt for par at the last hole, which made the day feel incredibly positive.” World number 10 Rose has not won since notching his first major title at Merion last June, and is still playing his way back into form after being hampered by a shoulder injury that kept him sidelined for the first six weeks this year. “I’ve had a lot of stop-starts this year and I just felt like I needed to get toned and sharp, and that’s beginning to show up,” said Rose. “It would be nice to go back (to the U.S. Open) with the confidence of having just won a tournament.” First round leader Cabrera used his ample length off the tee to stay in the hunt for his first victory in a regular PGA Tour event. Both of his official tour wins have come in majors, at the 2007 U.S. Open and 2009 Masters. “I was hoping to have a round below par today and ended up having a great round,” said Cabrera, whose best result in a non-major on the PGA Tour was a third placing here in 2010. “It’s a course that lets me hit driver a lot and for that reason it probably fits my game well and that’s why I play well here. “I think I hit it better today than yesterday. I’ve been working really hard to have weeks like this and I’m going to keep working and more weeks like this will come.” Co-leader Flores, who has not won on tour, made an eagle when he holed out from 105 yards at the par-four 11th hole. It was not a good day for the two biggest names in the field as Phil Mickelson shot 75 to fall seven strokes back while Rory McIlroy carded a 76, his worst ever score here, to plunge 10 shots behind. Both putted poorly. “I can’t believe the difference in putting from yesterday to today, “said British Open champion Mickelson, who had 34 putts. “Yesterday I saw every ball go in the hole and today I couldn’t get them to fall, which is funny because the greens were so perfect.” Northern Irishman McIlroy dropped five shots in the first four holes and in the end did well to make the cut on the number. “At least I made it through to the weekend,” said the 2010 champion, who also made the cut with nothing to spare when he won four years ago. Zimbabwe’s Brendon de Jonge shot the best round of the day, a 10-under 62 that was an 18-stroke improvement over his opening round.

915,WFC,Wells Fargo releases two new credit cards aimed at high spenders,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, trying to increase its credit card market position, said it is issuing two new credit cards through a partnership with American Express Co in its latest effort to woo more wealthy customers. The new cards, called Propel 365 and Propel World, offer rewards to consumers who are either big everyday spenders or frequent fliers and who also have another account with Wells Fargo. Cardholders can get up to an extra 50 percent increase in their reward points each year depending on the size of their other accounts at Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is looking to bulk up its credit card business, where the bank believes it punches below its weight. It is one of the largest U.S. mortgage and auto lenders, but has a weaker market position in credit cards. The San Francisco-based bank currently captures only a sliver of affluent consumers’ spending. A Wells Fargo executive said in a November investor presentation that around 3 percent of consumers who charge over $100,000 annually on their credit cards do it through a Wells Fargo product. “We know we’re underpenetrated in this customer base, and we’re looking to build our share,” Beverly Anderson, the head of Wells Fargo’s consumer financial services group, told Reuters in an interview. It’s a customer segment where Wells Fargo has some catching up to do. The head of JPMorgan Chase & Co’s credit card business, Eileen Serra, said at the bank’s February investor day that over half of affluent consumers in the market for a new credit card would consider going with Chase primarily. Wells Fargo did not appear on a slide in an accompanying presentation comparing Chase’s popularity against rival issuers. Wells Fargo announced its agreement with American Express in August 2013. Since the third quarter, the company had been testing its new offerings in five pilot markets around the country.

919,WFC,Wells Fargo sets up in Aberdeen as part of UK expansion,"LONDON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo (WFC.N), the world’s biggest bank by market value, this week opened an office in Aberdeen to tap into oil industry business on Scotland’s east coast as part of its UK expansion. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said the office has three people and is the latest step in a steady expansion in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), where it now has 930 people, up from about 600 at the start of 2012. Most are in Britain, where it has 721 employees, and its EMEA boss Jim Johnston said that will rise further. “We’ve grown more than we expected in each of the last three years ... we’ll continue to grow because the customer base in the U.S. and here has increasing activity with each other, and we’re hoping to gain market share,” Johnston told Reuters. The Aberdeen opening also suggests concerns that business may be put off by uncertainty over Scotland’s upcoming vote on independence could be overdone. Wells Fargo declined to comment on how the September vote might affect its plans. Aberdeen has been one of the most buoyant areas in banking in the past two years, built on business with oil, gas and energy services firms based in the city. Wells’ office is led by Kendal Milne, a former Barclays (BARC.L) and DNB (DNB.OL) oil and gas banker. Wells Fargo is regarded as one of the winners from the financial crisis and last month reported record quarterly earnings and its highest ever share price. It last year became the world’s biggest bank by market value and is now more than $50 billion bigger than its nearest challengers, including JPMorgan (JPM.N), ICBC (601398.SS) and HSBC (HSBA.L), yet it is mainly a U.S. bank with a modest international exposure. “We’re primarily a domestic bank but our American clients are getting increasingly global. It’s a consistent strategy, it’s following our customers here,” Johnston said. The bank does not break out its European earnings, but Johnston said revenues in the region had grown by at least 10 percent in each of the last three years. Its European expansion is mainly targeting wholesale services for U.S. medium and large companies, and catering to European firms active in the United States. Johnston said Britain topped a survey of its customers two years ago of where they wanted more services, ahead of Canada and China. Most of the expansion is in areas where it is strong in the United States, such as the energy industry and commercial real estate. It bought $5 billion of UK property loans last year from Germany’s Commerzbank (CBKG.DE).

925,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Disgruntled Wells Fargo team jumps to Raymond James,"NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - Robert J. Wood, a financial adviser with Wells Fargo Advisors, said on Tuesday he jumped with two other brokers to Raymond James Financial in Richmond, Va., last Friday because of frustration over pressure to sell Wells Fargo & Co bank products. His team, which includes Robert J. Wood, Jr., adviser Carlton Brown and an assistant, last year produced about $2 million of revenue, primarily from fees for managing stock and bond investments for about 200 client accounts, according to Raymond James. Wood, 73, had been with Wells Fargo Advisors and predecessor brokerage Wachovia Securities, since 2003, the year Wachovia’s bank parent bought a majority stake in Prudential Financial’s  Prudential Bache Securities. “There was no bank pressure to do product when we were Wachovia, and now there is,” Wood said in a telephone interview with Reuters. Wood said his chief complaint is that the team had to forsake part of its potential bonus in the last two years that was tied to making loans. He balked at making loan referrals in part because lenders at the bank tried to take credit for having the prime relationship with the client, he said. “Our (financial adviser) comp is very generous, and is based on best practices for doing what’s right for clients,” a Wells Fargo Advisors spokeswoman said in an email. Wood also was upset because Wells failed to register him and some other brokers in Florida, where he lives for more than half the year. He was fined $22,500 in 2012 for operating in the state without a license. Wells paid, Wood said, but he now has a mark on his brokerage record at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Wood, who began his brokerage career at E.F. Hutton & Co. in 1985, said his son is now managing partner of the team. They chose St. Petersburg, Florida-based Raymond James because it is a more traditional brokerage firm that gives its advisers more autonomy than Wells, he said. Wood had worked from the Wachovia’s former headquarters in Richmond. After Wells Fargo bought Wachovia Corp during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, it moved the brokerage firm’s headquarters to St. Louis. The Wall Street Journal’s website reported the team’s move earlier on Tuesday.

926,WFC,Wells Fargo is looking to pay out more to investors - CFO,"May 20 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co plans to return as much as 75 percent of its profits to shareholders, up from 34 percent in 2013, a top executive said on Tuesday. Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said at the bank’s 2014 investor day that Wells Fargo was looking to pay out between 55 percent and 75 percent of net income as dividends and stock repurchases, minus new share issuances. Shrewsberry did not say when the bank expected to meet the new goal for this measure, which it calls net payout ratio. Shrewsberry said he was confident the bank could meet the updated targets because it already generated a lot of earnings and was operating at its long-term capital requirements. At its 2012 investor day, the bank targeted a total payout ratio, which did not subtract new share issuance, of 50 percent to 65 percent. Its total payout ratio in 2013 was 55 percent. Any increase in dividends or share buybacks must be approved annually by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the bank’s board of directors. In March, the Fed did not object to Wells Fargo’s proposal to increase its quarterly dividend to 35 cents a share from 30 cents and to raise the number of shares it can repurchase. The bank said it was keeping its targets for a 1.30 percent to 1.60 percent return on assets and a 12 percent to 15 percent return on equity. Wells Fargo also did not change the target of its efficiency ratio, or revenue relative to costs, from a range of 55 percent to 59 percent.

929,WFC,McIlroy ends tumultuous week by winning Wentworth showpiece,"VIRGINIA WATER England (Reuters) - Former world number one Rory McIlroy ended a tumultuous week by firing a six-under-par 66 in the final round to score a fairytale victory in the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth on Sunday. The Northern Irishman, who broke up with tennis-playing fiancee Caroline Wozniacki a few days ago, finished with a 14-under total of 274 after a remarkable day of ebbing and flowing at the European Tour’s flagship event. Ireland’s Shane Lowry carded a 68 to take second place on 275 while Dane Thomas Bjorn, who went into the last round holding a five-stroke lead, ballooned to a 75 and had to be content with a share of third spot alongside twice former winner Luke Donald (70). On a topsy-turvy day of glorious sunshine during which the swirling winds and tricky pin positions caused the lead to constantly change hands, it was McIlroy who held his nerve the best. A succession of long putts were holed by the leading players and Donald twice chipped in over the closing stages but the 25-year-old McIlroy ultimately took the tournament by the scruff of the neck with four birdies in the last nine holes. The victory was McIlroy’s sixth on the European Tour and his first on the mainland. He had previously triumphed twice in Dubai, twice in the United States and once in Hong Kong. The world number 10 ended his campaign in stylish fashion, birdying the par-five 17th and 18th and he threw his ball high into the grandstands after converting a four-foot putt on the final green. “To win here at Wentworth, at the flagship event, I couldn’t have asked for anything more,” said McIlroy at the presentation ceremony after pocketing the first prize of 644,411 pounds ($1.09 million). “I played well this week and I knew coming here I was playing well because I’ve had a few top-10s in the States.  “I struggled a bit on Friday,” said the 25-year-old in reference to his second-round 71, “but I played great over the weekend.” Twice former major winner McIlroy has never looked upon Wentworth as a happy hunting ground. The 2011 U.S. Open and 2012 U.S. PGA champion missed the cut three times in his previous six starts and had a best finish of fifth in 2009. McIlroy began the last day seven shots adrift of Bjorn but went on to equal the biggest final-round comeback in the 60-year history of the BMW PGA Championship. “I was a little fortunate today because some of the guys ahead of me made some mistakes and I took advantage,” he said. “My caddie set me a target of 15-under to get to. I didn’t quite get there but 14-under was enough and I’m happy with that. “I really wanted to win before the second major of the season,” said McIlroy of next month’s U.S. Open, “and I couldn’t have asked for a better way to prepare.” Lowry was three strokes clear of the field after 12 holes but the 13th proved unlucky for the Irishman as he racked up a double-bogey six. He then gained some consolation by sinking a monster putt at the 18th. “I feel very unlucky,” said Lowry. “I felt I hit some great shots coming in ... but to hole the putt on the last and to finish second on my own is really nice. “Rory is definitely one of the best golfers I’ve ever played with and I’ve been lucky enough to play a lot of golf with him.  He’s had his struggles over the last couple of years and I’m delighted for him.” Donald chipped in from the off the green at the 13th and 16th but he and playing partner Bjorn were undone on the front nine where they both slumped to costly double-bogey sevens at the sixth. World number three Henrik Stenson, who could go top of the rankings depending on incumbent Adam Scott’s performance at the Colonial Invitational in Texas later on Sunday, shot a closing 70 to finish tied seventh on 280.

933,WFC,Judge denies Wells Fargo's bid to dismiss L.A. predatory lending suit,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co lost its bid to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the city of Los Angeles, which accuses the bank of predatory lending practices that targeted minority borrowers and led to the loss of property tax revenue. U.S. District Judge Otis Wright II ruled on Wednesday that the city’s claims were adequate for the case to proceed. In the lawsuit, Los Angeles said the bank had engaged in discriminatory lending practices since at least 2004 by making loans to minority borrowers that they could not afford, resulting in a disproportionate rise in the number of foreclosures. In the complaint filed by the city against Wells Fargo, former employees of the San Francisco-based bank described how the predatory loans were specifically marketed to minorities and minority communities in the city.  The city’s lawsuit also said that Wells Fargo denied credit to certain borrowers based on their race. Wells Fargo said it was prepared to defend its record as a responsible lender and its efforts to expand homeownership and to revitalize distressed neighborhoods in Los Angeles. “The court’s decision to allow the city attorney’s lawsuit to proceed, while disappointing, in no way suggests that the claims ultimately will prevail,” spokesman Gary Kishner said in an email. The mortgage crisis in Los Angeles resulted in over 200,000 foreclosures and an estimated $78 billion in decreased home values from 2008-2012, according to a report cited by the city. Property tax revenue losses during the same period are estimated to be $481 million, according to the report. Major banks are fighting multiple legal battles related to their mortgage lending practices. The city of Los Angeles filed separate lawsuits against Wells Fargo and Citigroup Inc last year, alleging that the banks were guilty of discriminatory lending since at least 2004.

946,WFC,JPMorgan sued by Miami over alleged mortgage discrimination,"NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co  has been sued by the city of Miami, accusing the bank of predatory mortgage lending in minority neighborhoods that allegedly caused a wave of foreclosures during the last decade’s housing crisis. The lawsuit, filed on Friday in federal court in Florida, said the country’s largest bank engaged in a continuous practice of discriminatory mortgage lending since at least 2004, violating the U.S. Fair Housing Act. After issuing high-cost loans to minorities in the years before the housing crisis, JPMorgan later refused to refinance the loans on the same terms as it extended to whites, leading to defaults and foreclosures, the complaint said. The lawsuit came just weeks after the city of Los Angeles filed similar claims against JPMorgan, seeking to recoup damages for lost tax revenue and increased city services needed in blighted neighborhoods. “The Miami City Attorney’s claims are baseless and stand contrary to our long record of providing affordable housing to low- to moderate-income families across the region,” JPMorgan spokesman Jason Lobo said. The bank will defend itself against the claims, he said. Wells Fargo & Co, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp also face lawsuits by Los Angeles and Miami for allegedly giving minorities home loans they could not afford, resulting in massive defaults. The banks have contested the claims, saying they have records as responsible lenders. Among major cities, Miami has led the country in foreclosures, and JPMorgan’s practices contributed to its problems, Friday’s lawsuit alleged. Loans in predominantly minority neighborhoods in Miami were about 4.6 times more likely to result in foreclosure than loans in neighborhoods with a majority of white residents, the lawsuit said. Miami is still being damaged because of the services needed to combat unsafe and dangerous conditions, crime and even gang activity at foreclosed properties, the lawsuit said. Wells Fargo and Citigroup recently lost bids to have their lawsuits tossed. A spokesman for the city of Miami did not immediately return a request for comment.

947,WFC,U.S. banks seen falling short of new debt funding rule,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo, State Street and JPMorgan Chase & Co are below or almost at minimum capital thresholds expected to be included in a rule still being hammered out by U.S. regulators that’s meant to mitigate taxpayer losses in another financial crisis, according to a Reuters analysis. U.S. banks are already required to hold equity equal to about 10 percent of their balance sheet to serve as a shock absorber to cover the risk of a sharp drop in the value of loans, investments and other assets on their books. Banks expect U.S. regulators to require them to hold another 10 percent in bonds with maturities of more than a year and other instruments, as part of the forthcoming rule.  Wells Fargo’s (WFC.N) loss-absorbing capital stood at 17 percent at the end of last year, State Street’s (STT.N) was 18.2 percent and JPMorgan (JPM.N) stood at 19.1 percent, according to a Reuters analysis of eight banks, based on regulatory filings and methodology recently presented by Citigroup. “These are figures which have been circulating,” said Bernard De Longevialle, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor’s. “The market tends to view these three (banks) as those who would potentially be the most stretched.” Analysts and officials at banks are basing their estimates for the benchmarks partially on discussions with regulators and on wider market assumptions for what would be a reasonable level. The Federal Reserve has typically taken a tougher stance than its counterparts in the European Union. The Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), who are jointly working on the rule, declined to comment. Regulators want creditors - and not just shareholders - to take a hit if a bank lands in trouble, to prevent a repeat of the panic that spread when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008. The equity requirements that U.S. banks already conform to are in line with recommendations made in the global Basel III accord. The Fed has said it is planning similar requirements for long-term debt instruments that investors buy knowing they might lose all or part of their money. This would double the loss-absorbing capacity of a bank’s capital to about 20 percent. Regulators from across the world are also working on such plans, but they still disagree about the details of a common approach they want to present when the G20 largest countries of the world meet at a summit in Brisbane, Australia, in November. The European Union wants banks’ loss-absorbing capital to stand at about 18 percent of the balance sheet, and analysts believe that the Fed will come up with a similar number, somewhere between 18 percent and 25 percent. JPMorgan declined to comment. State Street said it had “an ongoing dialogue with industry participants and regulators over a wide variety of issues”, and that it remained one of the most well-capitalized banks in the United States. Wells Fargo pointed to a May investor day, during which its Treasurer Paul Ackerman said he expected the bank’s long-term debt “to grow a little bit” to fill any gap. Since the beginning of last year, Wells Fargo has issued more than $11 billion in debt with maturities greater than 10 years. Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N) stood at 23.4 percent, Citigroup (C.N) at 22.8 percent and Bank of America (BAC.N) at 23.2 percent. All numbers are based on regulatory filings as of Dec. 31, 2013.  See graphic: (link.reuters.com/dun22w). The rule is intended to make sure that governments can wind down a failing bank that is considered to pose too much risk to the financial system to go through ordinary bankruptcy, while not burdening the taxpayer. In the U.S., for example, the FDIC has explained how it would go about the exercise, but the plan won’t work without the extra buffers. “Banks are more or less asked to keep a capital base ... of 9 to 10 percent of risk-weighted assets, and it’s just a simple rule of thumb to say you would have ... debt that would allow to double this amount,” De Longevialle said. FitchRatings in a recent presentation also assumed a total loss-absorbing capacity of 20 percent. Banks may not have too much trouble in raising more long-term debt depending on the exact details of the Fed’s requirement, analysts said, particularly if there is a long transition period. Questions about the levels and about what instruments would count towards the total add to banks’ anticipation about a long list of new rules that haven’t been fully implemented, or that regulators are still writing. The Fed alone is working on four more rules: to raise more capital for systemically important banks, to require banks to invest in assets they can easily sell, to balance the maturities of assets and liabilities, and to make the short-term funding market less susceptible to panics. One of the reasons that Wells Fargo is behind some of the other banks is that it has traditionally relied on client deposits for funding, and simply did not need to borrow money from other banks or from investors. While clients can quickly withdraw deposits, they are still considered “sticky” – meaning banks don’t anticipate that depositors will withdraw their funds all at once— and the Fed may take that into account by granting banks such as Wells Fargo more leeway when setting its long-term debt requirement. “We would not be surprised if there are some differentiations between the banks based on their business models. But that’s an assumption, that’s not an information,” De Longevialle said. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) have far fewer deposits to fund their business, and they are also the two banks that far exceed the 25 percent thought to be the upper boundary for loss-absorbing capital level. A senior Fed staffer working on the rule said at a conference last week he would prefer consensus among the world’s regulators grouped together in the G20’s Financial Stability Board before the Fed put out its own rule. Banks in Europe often have a different legal structure than those in the United States, which group all their operating subsidiaries under one holding company, and this may make it hard to agree on a common approach soon.

948,WFC,Steele bolts into one-shot lead at Travelers,"(Reuters) - American Brendan Steele eagled his opening hole and raised hopes of firing a magical 59 before finishing with an eight-under-par 62 in Thursday’s opening round at the Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Connecticut. Steele, who moved to eight under after just 13 holes before closing with five successive pars, ended the day with a one-stroke lead over compatriots Ryan Moore and Bud Cauley at the TPC River Highlands. Americans Chad Campbell, Joe Durant, Jeff Maggert, Scott Langley and Eric Axley carded 64s while 2010 winner and reigning Masters champion Bubba Watson opened with a 67. Steele, who won his only PGA Tour title at the 2011 Texas Open, made a sizzling start as he holed out from 129 yards to eagle the par-four first. He then birdied the second, seventh and eighth, where he drained a 27-footer, to reach the turn in five-under 30 before picking up further shots at the 11th, 12th and 13th. “The thoughts crept in,” Steele, 31, told reporters about the opportunity to shoot a 59 with three more birdies required over his last five holes. “If they don’t creep in, do I shoot 59, do I shoot 65? “It definitely was in the back of my mind, so probably amped me up a little bit more, so made everything a little bit tougher.” Steele was delighted, though, to reap reward on Thursday after playing some good golf over the past few months without getting the scores he felt he deserved, including missed cuts in his previous two tournaments. “I haven’t been getting a lot out of it,” said the Californian, who has recorded just two top-10s in 18 starts on the 2013-14 PGA Tour, his best finish a tie for sixth at the Phoenix Open in February. “I felt like I was really playing well at Byron Nelson and at Memorial and missed both cuts. I was just getting a little sloppy, a little lazy behind the ball, not seeing the shot, not getting into it the right way.” American world number five Matt Kuchar opened with a 66 while compatriot Ken Duke, who won last year’s Travelers Championship in a playoff with Chris Stroud, returned a 65. Australian Oliver Goss, one of four players in the field making their professional debuts this week, carded a 70. Erik Compton, a double heart-transplant recipient who tied for second at the U.S. Open four days ago, posted a 74.

949,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Wells Fargo lures two advisers from UBS Houston office,"NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo Advisors  has hired away two brokers from rival UBS Financial Services  in Houston, where they were responsible for managing more than $300 million in client assets. Robert Gardner III and Robert Higley produced $2.5 million in revenue over the last 12 months at UBS’s Houston-Galleria branch. They joined Wells Fargo’s office in Northwest Houston on Tuesday, and bring with them client associate Adrienne Zwahr, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said. Gardner and Higley are the latest team leaders to leave UBS’s operations in Houston in recent weeks. In late May, a four-person group led by Todd Lavergne left UBS in Houston for the independent Texas broker dealer U.S. Capital Advisors. U.S. Capital Advisors has about 100 wealth management employees across three offices in Texas. A spokesman for UBS declined to comment on the departures. Wells Fargo Advisors managed $1.4 trillion in client assets at the end of last year and had more than 15,280 full-service financial advisers.

950,WFC,Wells Fargo loses latest bid to end L.A. discrimination suit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge has denied Wells Fargo’s latest bid to end a lawsuit brought by the Los Angeles city government accusing the bank of discriminatory lending that led to a wave of foreclosures among minority borrowers.  In a ruling made public on Monday, U.S. District Judge Otis Wright denied the San Francisco-based bank’s motion to have an appeals court decide whether Los Angeles has legal standing to recover damages under the U.S. Fair Housing Act.  Wells is one of four banks sued by Los Angeles for allegedly giving minorities mortgage loans they could not afford, causing defaults, lower property values and neighborhood blight. The city is seeking damages for lost tax revenue and increased city expenses in affected neighborhoods. The mortgage crisis in Los Angeles resulted in more than 200,000 foreclosures and lowered home values by an estimated $78 billion from 2008 to 2012, according to a report cited by the city in its lawsuit, filed in December.  Spokesmen and lawyers for Wells and Los Angeles did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wells has previously contested the claims, saying it is prepared to defend its record as a responsible lender.  The city has also sued Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase to recover damages for alleged mortgage discrimination.  Wright in May had turned down Wells Fargo’s first motion to have the case dismissed. On Monday, he rebuffed the bank’s request for an immediate appeal of that decision, saying there were no substantial grounds for a difference of opinion about the law involved in the case. Wells had argued that the city lacked standing to recover damages under the Fair Housing Act, which was passed to provide for fair housing. The city’s attempt to recover damages for injuries that happened to other persons was outside the act’s purpose, Wells had argued.

952,WFC,ON THE MOVE-Wells Fargo hires 8 advisers managing $1 bln in assets,"NEW YORK, July 10 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo Advisors’  recruiting team had reason to celebrate even before last week’s Fourth of July. In the week before the holiday, the nation’s third-largest brokerage firm hired eight financial advisers who collectively managed more than $1 billion in combined client assets. The advisers will work at several east coast and mid-west offices. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the one-week recruiting  blowout was not necessarily reflective of overall hiring. The firm frequently keeps the names of new hires to itself, she said. These hires, announced on July 9, were all made between Friday, June 27, and Wednesday, July 2. None were immediately available for comment. Thomas Teagle, a financial adviser in Richmond, Virginia, joined Wells Fargo Advisors on June 27 from BB&T; Scott & Stringfellow, a division of BB&T; Securities, where he managed $155 million in client assets. Chris Carbone and Bill Brucato moved to Wells Fargo from RBC Capital Markets, the investment banking arm of the Royal Bank of Canada, where they managed $160 million. The two started on June 27 and are based in Utica, New York. Rob Wiggins rounded out the new hires on June 27, joining Wells Fargo’s Raleigh, North Carolina, office from First Citizens Investor Services, where he managed $100 million. On July 1, adviser Mark Pignotti joined Wells Fargo Advisors in Chicago from UBS Financial Services where he managed $317 million in client assets. The three-person team of Timothy Colvin, Jeffery Bedford and Gregory Taylor joined Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, or FiNet, on July 2 in Kingsport, Tennessee. FiNet is Wells Fargo’s independent broker-dealer for advisers who also function as business owners. The team joined from UBS Financial Services where they managed $326 million.

953,WFC,"UPDATE 1-Miami's mortgage discrimination suits against Citi, Wells dismissed","(Adds comment from Citigroup) By Dena Aubin July 10 (Reuters) - A federal judge has dismissed mortgage discrimination lawsuits filed by the City of Miami against Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co, following the dismissal of a similar lawsuit against Bank of America Corp  earlier this week. On Wednesday U.S. District Judge William Dimitrouleas dismissed the city’s claims against Citi and Wells under the U.S. Fair Housing Act. He referred to his reasoning in the Bank of America case, where he said Miami lacked standing to sue. Miami had sued the three banks in December, accusing them of causing a flood of foreclosures in minority neighborhoods during the last decade’s housing crisis by giving borrowers high-cost mortgage loans they could not afford. The city sought damages under the 1968 Fair Housing Act for lost property tax revenue because of a decline in home values and for extra city expenses in blighted neighborhoods. “We are pleased with the court’s ruling,” Citigroup spokesman Mark Rodgers said. “Citi is proud of its deep commitment to make sure our lending standards are fair to all of our customers.” Wells Fargo spokeswoman Catherine Pulley said the bank is pleased with the ruling and will continue working to expand home ownership and revitalize distressed neighborhoods. A spokesman for Miami could not immediately be reached for comment. In his dismissal of the Bank of America case, Dimitrouleas had said that the city’s claims were not covered by the Fair Housing Act, which was passed to prevent discrimination and assure fair housing across the country. The judge said Miami’s claims were only “marginally related” to the purpose of the act. The city’s alleged harm was also too remote from the bank’s conduct to bring a suit, Dimitrouleas said. A similar lawsuit filed by Miami last month against JPMorgan Chase & Co is still pending. The bank has not yet filed a motion for dismissal.

956,WFC,Wells Fargo's focus on energy shows growth strategy,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co is angling to cash in on the U.S. energy boom, as the fourth-largest U.S. bank looks for new avenues of revenue growth to overcome a slump in mortgage lending, its traditional driver of profits. The bank is increasingly looking for lending, investment banking and investing opportunities in the oil and gas sector. It says it now employs the largest staff of petroleum engineers of any U.S. bank. And unlike many of its other divisions, which are primarily focused on the U.S. market, Wells Fargo’s energy business has expanded internationally to places such as Aberdeen in Scotland and Calgary, Canada.  “We have the biggest and most-focused business in that space,” said Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry in an interview on Friday. He said Wells Fargo has 400 employees dedicated to serving energy companies.  Shrewsberry said the bank finances companies across the energy sector. These include companies specializing in exploration and production, those that own and operate pipelines and barges, and those that refine and process oil and natural gas.  Wells also says it is now the top underwriter of high-yield bonds and syndicated loans for oil and gas companies.  Additionally, it has $500 million to $600 million in direct equity stakes in energy firms through its merchant banking activities.  Wells Fargo’s push into the energy sector provides a window into how the San Francisco-based bank plans to make up for the decline in mortgage income, which plummeted in 2013 as a refinancing boom came to an end. The bank has said its 89 other businesses, ranging from auto loans and credit cards to wealth management and investment banking, would eventually make up for the lost revenue as the economy accelerates.  “They’re out on the sea in their boat and they’ve pitched their sails,” standing ready to benefit from economic growth, said Tony Scherrer, director of research at Smead Capital Management. The Seattle-based investment firm has $966 million in assets under management and owns Wells shares.  But so far growth has been tepid, with those other businesses failing to fully offset the decline in mortgages. In the second quarter, mortgage banking revenue was $1.7 billion, down 39 percent over the same period last year. Because of the diminished demand for home loans, both revenue and fee income at the bank has fallen for four consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. The energy sector has been one of the brighter spots in the U.S. economy over the last few years, thanks to the shale oil and gas discoveries and the fracking boom. It has made millions for wildcat drillers, mineral-rights holders and oil-and-gas firms and supercharged economic growth in North Dakota, Texas and other parts of the country.  Wells Fargo’s energy banking revenues have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 23 percent to $1.04 billion in 2013 from $690 million in 2011. Net income has grown at a similar pace, though Wells does not break out those numbers.  Wells Fargo, which has had a presence in energy banking for 40 years, touts the diversity of the business. Around 45 percent of that revenue comes from loans to energy companies, while a quarter comes from investment banking services.  A part of its strategy is to bank a lot of smaller energy firms in the hope it will be able to sell them more of its products and services as they grow, said Mike Johnson, head of Wells Fargo’s corporate banking, in May.  This practice of cross-selling is already paying some dividends. In 2012, Wells Fargo acquired a $3.5 billion portfolio of energy loans and a team of bankers from BNP Paribas. It has since increased the number of products that unit’s clients used to 8 from 5 in 2013.  Shrewsberry said many large energy clients have also recently tapped the bank to handle their wealth management needs. He declined to give the identity of the clients.

957,WFC,"Wells Fargo mortgage revenue drops, shares fall","(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, reported a 39 percent drop in mortgage revenue for the second quarter as lending volume dropped, underscoring the urgency for the bank to find other sources of income growth. The bank managed to boost earnings and meet analyst estimates through gains from investments in stocks and bonds among other areas. But that income could be difficult to repeat in coming quarters, analysts said. Meanwhile, the pressure on Wells Fargo’s mortgage business, one of its largest sources of revenue for years, is continuing and intense. The bank’s shares fell 0.4 percent to $51.58. Overall U.S. mortgage lending volumes have been falling for 15 months as rates have risen, cutting into demand to refinance home loans. This spring was also a weak home buying season compared with last year’s, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told investors on a conference call. “The purchase market is softer than we thought it would be,” Shrewsberry said. But Wells Fargo’s mortgage volume declines were greater than the overall market in percentage terms, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s estimates. That may be because last year smaller banks were selling their loans to Wells Fargo, which in turn would package them into bonds to sell to investors under government programs, which counted as Wells Fargo’s volume. Many of those banks are now selling directly to investors under government programs, Chairman and Chief Executive John Stumpf said in an interview. The bank is the largest U.S. mortgage lender. This is the first quarter since 2009 that Wells Fargo did not report an increase in earnings per share from the preceding quarter, ending a 17-quarter streak. The second-quarter results reflect how hard a job Stumpf has in trying to boost revenue from other businesses. Even as unemployment falls in the United States and the economy shows signs of recovery, loan growth has been tepid: the bank’s loans, excluding pre-crisis assets it is winding down, rose just 2 percent in the second quarter from the first quarter. Wells Fargo is the first of the major banks to post earnings, and rivals likely faced similar headwinds Overall, Wells Fargo earned $5.42 billion, or $1.01 per share, in line with estimates from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In the second quarter of 2013, the bank earned $5.27 billion, or 98 cents per share. The rising U.S. stock market helped Wells Fargo in several ways. Its net gains from equity investments rose 121 percent to $449 million, while earnings from its wealth, brokerage and retirement business grew 25 percent to $544 million thanks in part to fees tied to higher market valuations. Net gains from debt securities were $71 million compared with a loss of $54 million a year earlier. Revenue slipped to $21.1 billion, from $21.4 billion in the second quarter of 2013, slightly beating expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wells Fargo made $47 billion of home loans, down from $112 billion a year earlier but up from $36 billion in the first quarter. Revenue from mortgage banking fell to $1.7 billion.

960,WFC,Fitch: Wells Fargo's Results Remain Strong,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 11 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) has reported a decrease in  net income from the prior quarter, but the company's return on assets (ROA) of  1.47% still remains very strong, according to Fitch Ratings. Fitch views this  positively particularly in what remains to be a challenging operating  environment and believes that WFC's earnings performance helps to support the  company's high ratings.  Wells' 2Q'14 earnings, which were up nearly 4% versus the same quarter a year  ago, continue to be supported by lower credit costs and revenue growth across  its various business units. Fitch also observes that when adjusting for the  one-time discreet tax benefit in 1Q'14, earnings were actually up sequentially.  Revenue growth, which continues to be a challenge for the banking industry as a  whole, was up over 2% on a linked-quarter basis, reflecting not only one extra  day in the quarter but also organic loan growth and increases in mortgage  banking and wealth management revenue.  While net interest income expanded sequentially, WFC's net interest margin (NIM)  has continued its steady downward march, falling an additional 5bps from last  quarter. Additionally, the company's margin has fallen 32bps year-over-year, due  to a mix of higher cash and short-term investments as well as industry-wide  pressure on loan yields.  Noninterest income, up over 2.5%, once again increased on a linked-quarter  basis, driven by revenue growth across WFC's corporate banking, wealth  management and consumer banking platforms. After a strong 1Q'14, net gains from  trading activities, debt securities and equity investments were sequentially  down. However, increases in mortgage banking, and trust and investment fees  offset the decline.  After several sequential declines, WFC experienced a 30% increase in mortgage  originations compared to 1Q'14 leading to sequentially higher mortgage banking  income for the first time in over a year. Fitch notes that quarterly  applications were also up for the first time in over four quarters, increasing  20% indicating that mortgage activity, not only at WFC but industry-wide,  appears to have stabilized or is close to stabilizing. However, Fitch also notes  that gain on sale margins fell 20bps indicating the competitive nature of the  market in order to drive new business growth. Expenses rose noticeably on a sequential basis driven largely by a $205 million  linked-quarter increase in operating losses due primarily to litigation  accruals.

961,WFC,"UPDATE 4-Wells Fargo mortgage revenue drops, shares fall","(Adds links to graphic and Reuters Insider - Breakingviews) By Peter Rudegeair and Tanya Agrawal July 11 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, reported a 39 percent drop in mortgage revenue for the second quarter as lending volume dropped, underscoring the urgency for the bank to find other sources of income growth. The bank managed to boost earnings and meet analyst estimates through gains from investments in stocks and bonds among other areas. But that income could be difficult to repeat in coming quarters, analysts said. Meanwhile, the pressure on Wells Fargo’s mortgage business, one of its largest sources of revenue for years, is continuing and intense. The bank’s shares fell 0.4 percent to $51.58. Overall U.S. mortgage lending volumes have been falling for 15 months as rates have risen, cutting into demand to refinance home loans. This spring was also a weak home buying season compared with last year’s, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told investors on a conference call. “The purchase market is softer than we thought it would be,” Shrewsberry said. But Wells Fargo’s mortgage volume declines were greater than the overall market in percentage terms, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s estimates. That may be because  last year smaller banks were selling their loans to Wells Fargo, which in turn would package them into bonds to sell to investors under government programs, which counted as Wells Fargo’s volume. Many of those banks are now selling directly to investors under government programs, Chairman and Chief Executive John Stumpf said in an interview. The bank is the largest U.S. mortgage lender. This is the first quarter since 2009 that Wells Fargo did not report an increase in earnings per share from the preceding quarter, ending a 17-quarter streak. The second-quarter results reflect how hard a job Stumpf has in trying to boost revenue from other businesses. Even as unemployment falls in the United States and the economy shows signs of recovery, loan growth has been tepid: the bank’s loans, excluding pre-crisis assets it is winding down, rose just 2 percent in the second quarter from the first quarter. Wells Fargo is the first of the major banks to post earnings, and rivals likely faced similar headwinds Overall, Wells Fargo earned $5.42 billion, or $1.01 per share, in line with estimates from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In the second quarter of 2013, the bank earned $5.27 billion, or 98 cents per share. The rising U.S. stock market helped Wells Fargo in several ways. Its net gains from equity investments rose 121 percent to $449 million, while earnings from its wealth, brokerage and retirement business grew 25 percent to $544 million thanks in part to fees tied to higher market valuations. Net gains from debt securities were $71 million compared with a loss of $54 million a year earlier. Revenue slipped to $21.1 billion, from $21.4 billion in the second quarter of 2013, slightly beating expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wells Fargo made $47 billion of home loans, down from $112 billion a year earlier but up from $36 billion in the first quarter. Revenue from mortgage banking fell to $1.7 billion.

963,WFC,Harman British Open bound after winning in Illinois,"(Reuters) - American Brian Harman clinched a late ticket to the British Open when he won the John Deere Classic by one stroke in Silvis, Illinois, on Sunday. The diminutive left-hander handled the pressure of leading into the final round, overcoming early nerves to card a five-under-par 66 at TPC John Deere Run. He had the luxury of three-putting the final hole, tapping in from six inches to finish at 22-under 262, while compatriot Zach Johnson (64) was second at 21-under. “I bought my passport and a couple of jackets. I can’t wait to get on that plane,” Harman told CBS television. The leading finisher at the tournament who was not already exempt into the British Open qualified to play at Royal Liverpool starting on Thursday, so Harman was the last player to earn a spot on the charter flight that will arrive in Manchester on Monday morning. The 27-year-old has played in only one major, the 2012 U.S. Open, where he missed the cut. Harman collected $846,000 for his first PGA Tour victory. Among his other rewards is an invitation to next year’s Masters in his home state of Georgia. He took a one-stroke lead into the final round, and a fine eagle at the par-five second, where he drilled his approach shot to four feet, was a perfect starting tonic, though it took him several more holes to calm down. “I was aware of what was going on all day but I didn’t really start playing well until I put that in the back of my mind,” Harman told reporters. He has always had a knack for the game, but it was not until earlier this year when he stopped emulating his peers that he started to fulfill his potential. “I made the decision to try to be a better version of myself and see where that took me,” he said. “I’ve always been a pretty gifted ball-striker. This was really the first week I felt complete command, working the ball both ways. “This will have a special place in my heart for the remainder of my career.” He says his height (five feet, seven inches) has long provided motivation. “I’ve always had a chip on my shoulder. There are times that it feels good to hit it by a guy who’s bigger than me. “I just try to hit the back of the ball as hard as I can.” ",7132014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga/harman-british-open-bound-after-winning-in-illinois-idUSKBN0FI13F20140713
964,WFC,Journeyman Harman leads by one at John Deere Classic,"(Reuters) - Brian Harman hit almost every fairway and green to shoot six-under-par 65 and lead fellow American Steve Stricker by one stroke after the third round at the John Deere Classic in Silvis, Illinois, on Saturday. Harman, unlike his nearest rival, is carrying his passport in case he earns a late ticket to the British Open next week. Seeking his first win in his 88th start on the PGA Tour, Harman took advantage of generous hole locations and preferred lies after overnight rain to compile a round that included two eagles but was capped by a disappointing bogey at the last. Harman was at 17-under, while Stricker (64), who has won three times at the TPC Deere Run, was alone in second place after sinking a long birdie at the last. Another American, Scott Brown, was two back after a 61, the best round of the day. “I’m going to try to shoot the lowest score I possibly can,” Harman told reporters. “If it’s good enough, great. If not, I’ll be chilling on the boat next week. “It’s a first shot golf course. You’ve got to really get in good position to attack those pins. They were decently accessible today and I made a couple of putts and shot a good score.” Stricker, meanwhile, has already pulled out of the British Open for the second straight year, notwithstanding that he has does not have a major title on an otherwise impressive resume that includes 12 PGA Tour victories. Whatever his attitude towards the Open, he has an affinity for this week’s venue. “I have good feelings when I step up to the putts here,” he said. “To get back in the winner’s circle would mean a lot, so there will be some pressure on me as well as everybody else, but there is a comfort factor here for me for sure.” ",7132014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga/journeyman-harman-leads-by-one-at-john-deere-classic-idUSKBN0FH0Z020140713

Itaú obtained $400 million in a six-year term loan from Washington, D.C.-based Overseas Private Investment Corp, in the largest deal that the development agency, known as OPIC, ever carried out in Latin America. Wells Fargo, which also helped arrange the loan for OPIC, extended the remaining $80 million loan.

967,WFC,Ex-Bank of America trader avoids prison in muni bond case,"NEW YORK, July 25 (Reuters) - A former Bank of America Corp  derivatives trader who pleaded guilty to conspiring to falsify documents was spared prison on Friday after spending years helping the government probe bid-rigging in the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market. Brian Zwerner, a former manager of Bank of America’s municipal derivatives desk, was sentenced to spend three years on probation and pay a $10,000 fine by U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero in New York. Zwerner had pleaded guilty in 2011 to conspiring to make false entries in reports and other papers sent from his desk to bank management. According to court papers he has also agreed to pay Bank of America $890,000 and settle related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) civil charges. “I deeply regret my actions,” the Atlanta resident told Marrero. The government’s antitrust investigation has resulted in numerous convictions and $743 million in settlements with Bank of America, UBS AG, General Electric Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co. Zwerner’s lawyer said her client’s cooperation also helped the SEC understand complex mortgage products at the heart of the financial crisis. “He was their big break in the Abacus case and their case against Wachovia,” the lawyer, Katya Jestin, said in court. Wells Fargo paid $11 million in 2011 to resolve SEC claims over collateralized debt obligations sold by Wachovia Corp, which it bought at the end of 2008. Zwerner had begun working there in 2005. Goldman Sachs Group Inc, meanwhile, agreed in 2010 to pay $550 million to settle claims it misled investors in a CDO tied to subprime mortgages called Abacus 2007-AC1. Jestin declined to comment after the hearing. SEC representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department said from 1999 to 2002, Zwerner  conspired to falsify bank records related to marketing profits, so Bank of America could pay kickbacks to brokers including Beverly Hills, California-based CDR Financial Products Inc. Prosecutors said these kickbacks enabled the bank to pay brokers to manipulate bidding for investment agreements or other municipal finance contracts, and win certain bids. Bank of America, which reported the misconduct after uncovering it, reached a $137.3 million settlement with federal and state authorities in 2010, and agreed to pay $20 million to resolve a related class action in 2013. Phillip Murphy, a former managing director of Bank of America’s municipal derivatives desk, is the last defendant convicted in the municipal bond probe to still await sentencing. Zwerner had been expected to testify against him. The case is U.S. v. Zwerner, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-cr-00293.

971,WFC,Exclusive: Wells Fargo loosens standards for jumbo mortgages,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) has relaxed its standards for loans for some high-priced homes as the largest U.S. mortgage lender tries to combat an industry-wide drop in mortgage volumes. The bank has eased its lending standards on mortgages it acquires from other banks, said spokesman Tom Goyda, for “jumbo” loans that are too large to receive a guarantee from government-backed mortgage companies.  In late July, the San Francisco-based bank lowered the minimum credit score on these fixed-rate jumbo mortgages to 700 from 720, Goyda said. Credit scores range from 300 to 850, and levels below 640 are often considered subprime. The lower requirements for jumbo loans are the latest effort by Wells and other banks to loosen mortgage criteria that are still tight by historical standards. Of the large banks surveyed by the Federal Reserve in July, thirty-nine percent said they were somewhat relaxing requirements on prime residential mortgages, and all banks reported that demand for prime mortgages was at its highest level in a year. The mortgage industry is seeking to replace lost revenue after a spike in mortgage rates in the second half of 2013 made refinancing less attractive.  But for many lenders the search for revenue is tempered by the fact that the housing market is still recovering from the worst crisis since the Great Depression. New rules and regulations designed to prevent the next mortgage implosion have also made some banks less willing to take risk in the market.  In June, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said, “It is difficult for any homeowner who doesn’t have pristine credit these days to get a mortgage. I think that is one of the factors that is causing the housing recovery to be slow.”      In addition to lowering minimum credit scores, Wells Fargo is now willing to buy jumbo loans from other lenders that go toward the purchase of a second home, Goyda said. For a refinancing, the bank is now willing to buy mortgages whose balance exceeds the size of the borrower’s previous loan, known as “cash-out refinancing.”      Wells Fargo’s standards for mortgages it buys from other lenders remained more conservative than those it offers directly to consumers via its branches and online, Goyda said. The minimum credit score on those jumbo mortgages is 680.  The latest expansion of Wells Fargo’s mortgage lending comes six months after the bank began to offer home loans directly to borrowers with credit scores as low as 600 that were eligible for insurance with the Federal Housing Administration. Its previous minimum credit score for FHA-insured loans was 640.  Wells Fargo executives have said its steps to expand access to mortgage credit are low-risk, as all borrowers must demonstrate an ability to repay the loan in accordance with rules issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that came into effect in January. Most products the bank offers are 30-year, fixed-rate loans that do not allow borrowers to defer principal payments, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage President Mike Heid said at the bank’s May investor day.  “This talk about returning to subprime is just nonsense,” Heid said.  As industry-wide lending volumes have declined over the last year, Wells Fargo’s drop has been even sharper. The bank said last month that it made $47 billion in home loans in the second quarter, 58 percent less than the same period of 2013, compared with a 50 percent fall in industry-wide volumes, according to estimates from the Mortgage Bankers Association.  “The purchase market is softer than we thought that it would be,” said Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry on a July conference call with analysts. “We’re not seeing breakout returns to pre-crisis levels of the enthusiasm around homeownership.” Chief Executive John Stumpf told Reuters in a July interview that the volume of mortgages it purchased from other banks in the second quarter was lower because those lenders are now selling directly to investors under government programs.

973,WFC,"UPDATE 1-Buffett's Berkshire reveals Charter stake, cuts DirecTV","NEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed a new  $366 million stake in cable TV operator Charter Communications Inc and pared its holdings in two other pay-TV companies, part of a flurry of changes in its stock investments during the second quarter. Shares of Charter shares rose about 2 percent after-hours after Berkshire reported a new 2.3 million share stake, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that detailed its domestic equity investments as of June 30. Charter is “the play of choice on cable consolidation,” said Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan. “You’ve got a good story on an as-is basis and if they do more deals they can do a lot more value,” he said. DirecTV is awaiting regulatory approval to sell itself to AT&T; for $48.5 billion. Charter declined to comment. A message left with DirecTV was not immediately answered. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new  investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him. Berkshire did not disclose whether the Charter investment was made by Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Buffett has said he generally makes Berkshire’s larger investments such as Wells Fargo & Co and Coca-Cola Co , while other investments, especially in sectors he is less familiar with, are often made by Combs or Weschler, who have smaller sums to invest. Within the pay TV sector, Berkshire said its stake in DirecTV fell by about 11 million shares since the end of March to 23.5 million. It is also no longer reporting any stake in premium TV cable network Starz. The sales of stocks contributed to a significant increase during the quarter in Berkshire’s cash pile, which ended June at $55.5 billion. That gives Buffett power to make at least one big acquisition and still retain his desired $20 billion cushion. In Thursday’s filing, Berkshire reported a new stake in Now Inc, an energy distribution business recently spun off from oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc , whose stock Berkshire also owns. Among the companies in which Berkshire reported higher share stakes were General Motors Corp, IBM Corp, Suncor Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. It also reported lower holdings in many companies, including oil company ConocoPhillips, former Washington Post owner Graham Holdings Co, National Oilwell Varco, and former Starz owner Liberty Media Corp. U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window to their strategies for buying and selling stocks. Berkshire ended June with more than $119 billion of equities, about 90 percent of which are on U.S. exchanges. It also owns more than 80 businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance to railroads.

983,WFC,Wells Fargo finds mortgage myths hamper home purchases,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Getting a mortgage in the United States may be easier than many borrowers think, according to a survey released Monday by Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the largest U.S. mortgage lender. Nearly two-thirds of respondents thought that a very good credit score was necessary to buy a home, and more than 40 percent thought they needed a down payment equal to at least 20 percent of the purchase price to buy a home. Under government-backed programs, first-time home buyers with subprime credit scores can get a mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration, and they can put down as little as 3.5 percent of the purchase price. Since the financial crisis, lenders have clamped down on mortgage credit. The Mortgage Bankers Association’s Mortgage Credit Availability Index, which measures the ease with which borrowers can take out a home loan based on credit scores, loan-to-value ratios and other factors, fell by more than 80 percent from early 2007 through August 2014. But there are other reasons why consumers are not taking out loans like they once did, including the fear of being turned down. In 2013, those fears kept 19 percent of families from taking steps to get a consumer loan, up from 18.5 percent in 2010 and above the 16.4 percent rate of families who were actually turned down for credit, according to the Federal Reserve’s most recent survey of consumer finances. Even if mortgage credit is hard to come by, there is demand for homes: more than two out of three respondents in Wells Fargo’s survey said it was a good time to buy. Franklin Codel, Wells Fargo’s head of mortgage production, said his bank has taken steps to expand the pool of eligible home buyers. Earlier this year it lowered the minimum credit scores, or FICO scores, for loans that are backed by the government the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac. “When we expanded FICO ranges, we saw not only an increase in applications but we also saw an increase in approval rates,” Codel said, without providing specifics on application volume or approval rates. Codel also said that the federal government, along with Wells Fargo and the realtors and consumer groups with whom it works, can play a role in dispelling these myths through some kind of outreach program along the lines of what they did with the government-subsidized Home Affordable Refinance Program and the Home Affordable Modification Program. Because Wells Fargo’s survey is the first of its kind, it is difficult to say how attitudes toward home ownership have changed over time. Fannie Mae’s August national housing survey found a similar number of borrowers – 64 percent – thought it was a good time to buy a home, though tied an all-time low and was down from the 71 percent response rate in the August 2013 survey.

988,WFC,Wells Fargo admits to control problems from insider-trading case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A unit of Wells Fargo will admit to wrongdoing and pay a $5 million penalty to settle charges that it failed to have adequate controls in place to prevent an employee from illegal insider trading, U.S. regulators said on Monday. The Securities and Exchange Commission said Wells Fargo Advisors LLC did not have proper controls, unreasonably delayed producing documents during the SEC’s probe, and provided an “altered document” related to a compliance review of the broker’s trading. Tony Mattera, a spokesman for Wells Fargo Advisors, declined to comment. The SEC said on Monday that this marked the first time it had ever filed charges against a brokerage for failing to protect a customer’s material, non-public information. The SEC’s case against Wells Fargo related to alleged activity by Waldyr Da Silva Prado Neto, a former Brazil-based broker who has been charged in criminal and civil proceedings with insider trading in Burger King securities before a 2010 buyout. Prosecutors alleged in January that Prado learned from a client that the private equity firm 3G Capital Partners had planned to buy Burger King, and passed the news to Igor Cornelsen, a banker who had been prodding him for tips. The two allegedly communicated via email in Portuguese, with Cornelsen asking if the “sandwich deal” was going to happen.  After Prado confirmed it, the two both traded Burger King securities before the buyout announcement, and collectively reaped more than $1 million in profits, prosecutors said. Cornelsen and his firm, Bainbridge Group, previously settled parallel SEC charges in November 2012 and agreed to pay $5.18 million. Earlier this year, a federal judge issued a default judgment of $5.63 million against Prado in connection with the SEC’s charges.  The SEC alleges that numerous groups at Wells Fargo responsible for compliance and supervision had an indication that Prado was misusing customer information but failed to take action. The regulator also said that when the SEC asked Wells Fargo to turn over records about its compliance reviews for the broker’s trading, certain documents were omitted and took six months to finally produce. “Wells Fargo unreasonably delayed producing documents to the SEC’s staff and altered a previously requested compliance document after the SEC charged a former Wells Fargo employee with insider trading,” said Daniel Hawke, the chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Market Abuse Unit.   “The firm’s actions improperly delayed our investigation, and the production of an altered document interfered with our search for the truth.” Prado is not the only Wells Fargo employee accused of insider trading in recent years. In 2012, the SEC charged John Femenia, a former banker for Wells Fargo Securities, with misusing his position to obtain material, non-public information about mergers involving his clients. Femenia and the others involved in that scheme have since pleaded guilty to parallel criminal charges.

991,WFC,U.S. charges ex-Wells Fargo employees with insider trading,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Monday charged two former Wells Fargo employees with insider trading, saying a former research analyst tipped a trader about pending rating changes for six healthcare stocks. The Securities and Exchange Commission said former analyst Gregory Bolan Jr, 37, tipped former trader Joseph Ruggieri, 35, about the upcoming upgrades and downgrades in ratings. Ruggieri made more than $117,000 in profits, the agency said. The SEC said Bolan also tipped another close friend about the ratings changes, letting the friend reap $10,000. The friend has since died. The two ex-employees plan to contest the charges in the SEC’s administrative court.  Sam Lieberman, an attorney with Sadis & Goldberg LLP, said Bolan and Ruggieri “vehemently deny” the charges and that the SEC’s decision to bring the case in its in-house court instead of a federal court raises questions about its case. “The SEC knows that it has serious weaknesses in its case, and that is why it is choosing to bring this as an administrative proceeding instead of trying this case in a federal court,” he said.  He also contested some facts in the SEC complaint, saying Ruggieri did not reap $117,000. It was a proprietary account for the bank and not his client’s personal account, he said.  Monday’s case marks at least the third time the SEC has charged former Wells Fargo employees with insider trading in recent years.  Last week, Wells Fargo was fined by the SEC and admitted it had faulty control procedures in connection with a  different employee in the Wells Fargo Advisors LLC unit who has been charged in criminal and civil proceedings with insider trading in Burger King securities before a 2010 buyout.  A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said Wells Fargo Securities immediately reported the concerns in this case to the SEC in 2011, is “not a party to the matter” and cooperated during the probe. According to the SEC complaint, Ruggieri was fired from Wells Fargo in 2011, and Bolan resigned after both were questioned by compliance personnel about communications involving non-public information. The SEC said that between April 2010 and March 2011, Bolan published eight ratings changes, and Ruggieri traded ahead for six, either by selling stock short or purchasing stock depending on whether an upgrade or downgrade was coming.

994,WFC,"Fitch Affirms Wells Fargo's L-T IDR at 'AA-' Following Large Regional Bank Review, Outlook Stable","(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Wells Fargo & Company's  (WFC) ratings at 'AA-/F1+'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The affirmation  reflects its superior earnings profile, diversified business model, and strong  management team.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T; Corporation (BBT), Capital One Financial Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T; Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holdings  Corporation (MUFG), PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - VRs, IDRs, and Senior Debt: Wells Fargo & Company's (WFC) ratings were affirmed primarily reflecting the  company's superior earning profile, strong franchise and business model, and  experienced management team. The company's capital and liquidity profiles remain  solid, and asset quality continues to improve.  WFC's financial performance over the past several years has been very solid  despite a challenging economic and interest rate environment. WFC continues to  post very strong net income each quarter, with return on assets (ROAs) well in  excess of the large regional average. This is particularly noteworthy given the  dramatic slowdown in refinancings beginning in the second half of last year, and  WFC's prominent role in mortgage.  Fitch considers WFC's franchise and business model as a key rating strength. WFC  boasts leading market shares in many areas, including mortgage originations,  servicing, commercial real estate, small business lending, automobile lending,  and private student lending. WFC's retail branch network had either the leading  or second largest market share in 25 of the 39 states in which it operates.  Furthermore, WFC is either first, second or third in markets that comprise over  90% of total consolidated deposits. WFC offers a wide range of financial  services through more than 80 different business lines. This diversity helps  insulate the company from downturns in various product lines, as evidenced by  the recent mortgage refinancing slowdown. WFC's management team is viewed very favorably by Fitch. There has been a great  deal of stability in the executive management ranks, with little turnover. What  also sets WFC apart from its peers is the bench strength and tenure with WFC of  the executive management team. The average tenure with WFC of the operating  committee, which comprises the business lines heads, as well as the company's  CEO, CRO, CFO and general counsel, is approximately 27 years. Fitch views this  as a competitive strength as the company's strategic direction and corporate  culture remains consistent, and less vulnerable to swings in strategy. WFC's  stated strategic objectives are clearly articulated, and achievable. Even during  a challenging interest rate environment, the company is able to easily meet its  four publicly stated financial targets. Fitch believes that WFC is appropriately capitalized, particularly given its  solid funding and earnings profiles, to manage through continued economic  challenges ahead.  WFC's estimated common equity Tier I (CETI) under Basel III  (Advanced Approach, fully phased-in) was 10.14% at June 30, 2014, slightly above  the company's internal target of 10%. WFC indicated that CCAR is the primary  driver influencing targeted capital ratios. WFC, like the industry, is vulnerable to a rapid unexpected increase in interest  rates, particularly in its securities portfolio. Approximately 60% of the AFS  portfolio is made up mortgage-backed securities, which are exposed to a rising  rate environment given possible extension risk. At June 30, 2014, net unrealized  gains in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio totaled $3.7 billion. If rates  were to rise 200 basis points (bps), the unrealized position would fall to a  loss of $10.3 billion in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Fitch  estimates that this would lead to an approximate 70 bps decline in the company's  estimated CETI under Basel III. As such, and given the treatment of MSRs under  Basel III and the finalization of any systemically important capital buffer for  WFC, Fitch expects WFC to maintain an appropriate capital buffer to withstand  the related volatility in capital ratios. WFC is primarily deposit funded, with core deposits representing 75% of total  funding sources as of June 30, 2014. Fitch views WFC's deposit franchise as  currently undervalued in this low-rate environment. As deposit rates have fallen  from pre-crisis levels, the benefit to WFC from its low cost of funding has  compressed. When interest rates rise, WFC will likely be able to maintain lower  funding costs relative to peers, helping to maintain superior profitability  metrics in a higher interest rate environment.  WFC's high credit ratings have helped it gain universal acceptance in virtually  all global capital markets on favorable terms, and Fitch anticipates that WFC  will continue to be able to easily issue debt to meet upcoming debt maturities  and other requirements. The parent's liquidity profile is considered solid, and  may be impacted given the outcome of Orderly Liquidity Authority (OLA)-related  proposed long-term debt requirements.  WFC will likely be one of the banking institutions that is assigned a long-term  debt requirement to facilitate resolution under OLA. Fitch notes that if the  regulators do not pursue a risk-based approach and rather apply a one-size fits  all approach, WFC will likely be the most disadvantaged of the U.S.-based G-SIBs  given its greater reliance on deposit funding and, hence, lower levels of  outstanding long-term debt. Fitch expects that WFC should be able to meet a debt  requirement, assuming there is a sufficient phase-in period. WFC still needs to  issue preferred stock and subordinated debt to meet Basel III capital  requirements and expects that to count toward the long-term debt requirement.  WFC's credit risk metrics have improved alongside the industry, but  non-performing asset (NPA) ratios remain very elevated and are the highest  amongst the large regional bank peer group. Much of the weak relative  performance is due to a large balance of mortgage-related accruing TDRs. WFC  entered the crisis with a larger relative exposure to home mortgages and home  equity products than its peers. Despite higher NPA levels, net charge-offs  (NCOs) are roughly in line with peer averages. Troubled debt restructurings  (TDRs) are high and are expected to remain elevated; however, Fitch views WFC's  strong earnings capacity as an adequate risk mitigant. RATING SENSITIVITIES - VRs, IDRs, and Senior Debt: Given that WFC's ratings are already at the top of the global rated bank  universe, Fitch views limited potential for a ratings upgrade over the near  term. Conversely, failure to maintain earnings at current levels will pressure  WFC's ratings. The strength of the earnings stream provides for solid capital  generation capabilities, which will help absorb unexpected losses.  Fitch notes some expansion recently of the wholesale banking business segment,  as WFC builds out its international presence and capital markets offerings.  Fitch expects any expansion by WFC internationally or in investment banking to  remain a primarily customer-focused strategy, and outside of that, both are  expected to remain relatively small in terms of total business mix. If WFC were  to increase its investment banking business to a size in line with other large  trading banks, there would likely be negative rating implications, although  Fitch views this as unlikely over the near term.   Fitch is aware that WFC has the ability to compete for loan growth by offering  competitive pricing given its low-cost funding base and its ability to ensure  adequate total relationship profitability with other cross-sold services and  products. However, despite the company's historical track record of being sound  risk managers, this bears close monitoring as it may point to an incremental  shifting in the company's risk appetite. Fitch remains concerned regarding the  entire industry's search for yield and stretching for risk as a result of the  continued low-yield environment. Given WFC's strong profitability metrics, Fitch  expects this possible impulse would be less urgent then at other banking  institutions. Nonetheless, if a significant shift in the risk appetite became  apparent, this would likely pressure ratings.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  WFC's Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF) reflect Fitch's  expectation that there remains an extremely high probability of support from the  U.S. government if required. This expectation reflects the U.S.'s extremely high  ability to support its banks especially given its strong financial flexibility,  though propensity is becoming less certain. Specific to WFC, Fitch's view of  support likelihood is based mostly on their systemic importance in the U.S.,  significant deposit market share, and its position as a key provider of  financial services to the U.S. economy. WFC's IDRs and senior debt ratings do  not benefit from support because its VR is above the SRF. However, in Fitch's view, there is a clear intention to reduce support for  G-SIFIs in the U.S., as demonstrated by the Dodd Frank Act (DFA) and progress  regulators have made on implementing the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA).  The FDIC has proposed its single point of entry (SPOE) strategy and further  initiatives are demonstrating the U.S. government's progress to eliminate state  support for U.S. banks going forward, which increases the likelihood of senior  debt losses if its banks run afoul of solvability assessments. RATING SENSITVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  The SR and SRF are sensitive to progress made in finalizing the SPOE strategy  and any additional regulatory initiatives that may be imposed on the G-SIFIs,  including debt thresholds at the holding company. Fitch's assessment of  continuing support for U.S. G-SIFIs has to some extent relied upon the  feasibility of OLA implementation rather than its enactment into law (when DFA  passed). Hurdles that remain include the resolution of how cross-border  derivative acceleration/termination provisions are handled and that there is  sufficient contingent capital at the holding company to recapitalize without  requiring government assistance.  Fitch expects that the SPOE strategy and regulatory action to ensure sufficient  contingent capital will be finalized in the near term, but regardless of its  finalization Fitch believes that sufficient regulatory progress continues to be  made over the rating in the ratings time horizon. Therefore, Fitch expects to  revise WFC's Support Rating to '5' and SRF to 'No Floor' in the next 12-18  months. A revision of the SRF to 'No Floor' would mean no change to WFC's  long-term IDR and debt ratings because their viability ratings are all above the  SRF. KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   WFC's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should WFC's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely though for WFC given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. This may result  in a possible downgrade of WFC's holding company rating, an upgrade of operating  company ratings, or no changes to ratings if Fitch's views the long-term debt  requirement assigned to WFC as providing an insufficient amount of bail-in  capital at the operating company level.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of WFC's bank subsidiaries benefit from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of Wells  Fargo Bank N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank Northwest N.A. are equalized across the  group.  The IDRs and VRs of WFC's other major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized  with WFC's IDR reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to WFC's  business strategy and financial profile. These entities include: Wells Fargo  Canada Corp, Wachovia Capital Finance Corporation (Canada), and Wells Fargo  Securities International Limited, whose IDRs would be sensitive to the same  factors that might drive a change in WFC's IDR. RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of WFC to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in WFC's IDRs.  To the extent that one of WFC's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from WFC's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by WFC and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from WFC or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by WFC and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in WFC's VR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS WFC's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. However, WFC's uninsured  deposits outside of the U.S. do not benefit from rating uplift because they do  not typically benefit from the U.S. depositor preference unless the deposit is  expressly payable at an office of the bank in the United States. Since Fitch  cannot determine which foreign branch deposits may be dually payable, they do  not get the rating uplift. KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by WFC and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in WFC's long- and short-term IDRs.   Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Wells Fargo & Co. --Long-term IDR at 'AA-'; Outlook Stable; --Senior debt at 'AA-'; --Subordinated debt at 'A+'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'; --Commercial paper at 'F1+'; --Short-term debt at 'F1+';  --Market-linked securities at 'AA- EMR'; --Viability at 'aa-'; --Support at '1'; --Support floor at 'A'.

997,WFC,Wells Fargo profit rises 1.7 percent as mortgage business steadies,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) said third-quarter profit rose 1.7 percent, after the biggest U.S. mortgage lender’s home loan business eked out its first income increase since the end of 2012.  The bank made more money from selling home loans to investors during the quarter, allowing it to post a 2 percent increase in mortgage banking income even as it made 40 percent fewer home loans compared to the same period last year. The U.S. mortgage market is showing some signs of stabilizing, after plunging for about a year. Higher home loan rates in the middle of last year cut into consumer demand to refinance mortgages, hurting results at most major U.S. banks, but rates are now in more of a holding pattern.  The results underscore how critical mortgage income still is to Wells Fargo. Although the bank often talks about its 89 other businesses, its fortunes in any quarter often depend largely on the home loan market.  Fourth-quarter mortgage volumes are set to be lower than the $48 billion Wells Fargo made in the third quarter of 2014, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on a conference call with analysts. That means they will also be lower than the $50 billion it made in the fourth quarter of 2013.  “I believe there are several factors holding the housing market back from a complete recovery,” Chief Executive John Stumpf said on a conference call with analysts. He cited high levels of student debt, the lack of housing inventory in populous coastal markets and the legal difficulties in lending to higher-risk borrowers. Beyond mortgage, the bank did get some help in the quarter from other businesses, including private equity and venture capital investments, where the bank recorded $712 million of income before taxes, up from $502 million in the same quarter last year. The San Francisco bank’s venture capital investments in technology performed well in the quarter, Shrewsberry said in an interview.  The bank reported mixed progress on three major growth initiatives: credit cards, wealth management and investment banking. Credit card balances rose 11 percent to $28.3 billion from the third quarter of 2013, but the pace of new account growth slowed.  Profits at Wells Fargo’s wealth, brokerage and retirement segment rose 22 percent from a year earlier to $550 million, but investment banking fees fell 7 percent to $371 million over the same period. Overall, the fourth-largest U.S. bank’s net income for common shareholders was $5.41 billion, or $1.02 per share, in the quarter, in line with analysts’ expectations. A year ago, it posted profit of $5.32 billion, or 99 cents per share. Wells Fargo’s loan portfolio grew by 3.7 percent to $838.9 billion in the quarter from the same period a year earlier, led by a 13 percent increase in commercial and industrial loans.

1000,WFC,Managed account growth drove profit at Wells Fargo wealth unit,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sales of mutual funds and other managed accounts by Wells Fargo & Co’s (WFC.N) more than 15,000 retail brokers drove a 22 percent gain in net income at the bank’s “wealth, brokerage and retirement” segment in the third quarter.  Profit at the wealth unit, the smallest of the U.S. bank’s three businesses, jumped to $550 million from $450 million a year earlier, Wells said on Tuesday.  Wells’ wealth, brokerage and retirement sector includes financial planning advice for wealthy investors as well as brokerage services and retirement and trust services for individuals and companies. Like many brokerage firms, Wells has been steering financial advisers to sell investment packages managed by outside advisers rather than touting individual stocks and bonds.  Managed products offer diversification for investors as well as marketing and service fees from the outside funds and advisers for banks. They also allow brokers to spend more time on client service and prospecting and less on investments, according to brokerage executives. Managed accounts also help insulate brokers and their firms from client complaints when individual investment recommendations go awry. Assets in managed accounts of brokerage clients climbed 17 percent in the third quarter to $409 billion even as Wells’ brokerage force dipped 1 percent to 15,163 advisers. Wells remains the second-largest U.S. brokerage by number of brokers behind Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which has not yet reported third-quarter results.  Total client brokerage assets were up 8 percent from a year earlier to $1.4 trillion as of Sept. 30. Fee revenue based largely on assets held in client accounts were a major contributor to the wealth unit’s 7 percent rise in quarterly revenue to $3.6 billion, Wells said. Fees were spurred by stock market gains as well as new sales. Wells prices managed account fees at the start of each quarter, meaning third-quarter fees reflected account values as of June 30.  Expenses in the wealth businesses rose 3 percent to $71 million due in large part to increased broker commissions even though transaction revenue fell. Like Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), UBS AG UBSN.VX and other banks with big wealth networks, Wells encourages its advisers to sell mortgages, portfolio-secured loans and other banking and insurance products. Average net loans in the third quarter increased 13 percent from a year earlier and 3 percent from the second quarter to $52.6 billion. Money set aside for possible loan losses in the wealth unit grew $13 million from a year earlier, but, in a sign of improving credit, were well above the amount of loans that Wells charged off during the quarter. Charge-offs of bad loans fell throughout the bank, which is the world’s biggest mortgage and auto lender.  Assets in individual retirement accounts managed by Wells grew 8 percent from a year earlier to $354 billion, while assets in institutional retirement plans the bank oversees rose 6 percent to $314 billion.

Managed accounts also help insulate brokers and their firms from client complaints when individual investment recommendations go awry. Assets in managed accounts of brokerage clients climbed 17 percent in the third quarter to $409 billion even as Wells’ brokerage force dipped 1 percent to 15,163 advisers. Wells remains the second-largest U.S. brokerage by number of brokers behind Morgan Stanley, which has not yet reported third-quarter results. Total client brokerage assets were up 8 percent from a year earlier to $1.4 trillion as of Sept. 30. Fee revenue based largely on assets held in client accounts were a major contributor to the wealth unit’s 7 percent rise in quarterly revenue to $3.6 billion, Wells said. Fees were spurred by stock market gains as well as new sales. Wells prices managed account fees at the start of each quarter, meaning third-quarter fees reflected account values as of June 30. Expenses in the wealth businesses rose 3 percent to $71 million due in large part to increased broker commissions even though transaction revenue fell. Like Bank of America Corp, UBS AG and other banks with big wealth networks, Wells encourages its advisers to sell mortgages, portfolio-secured loans and other banking and insurance products. Average net loans in the third quarter increased 13 percent from a year earlier and 3 percent from the second quarter to $52.6 billion. Money set aside for possible loan losses in the wealth unit grew $13 million from a year earlier, but, in a sign of improving credit, were well above the amount of loans that Wells charged off during the quarter. Charge-offs of bad loans fell throughout the bank, which is the world’s biggest mortgage and auto lender. Assets in individual retirement accounts managed by Wells grew 8 percent from a year earlier to $354 billion, while assets in institutional retirement plans the bank oversees rose 6 percent to $314 billion.

1004,WFC,U.S. SEC says ex-Wells Fargo compliance officer altered document,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former compliance officer at a unit of Wells Fargo & Co was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday for allegedly altering a document before it was given to the agency during an insider trading investigation. The SEC said Judy Wolf, then at Wells Fargo Advisors LLC, in 2010 closed an internal review of a Brazil-based broker’s trading with no findings. The broker, Waldyr Da Silva Prado Neto, was subsequently charged in criminal and civil proceedings with trading illegally in Burger King securities before a 2010 buyout of the fast food company. After the SEC charged Prado in 2012, Wolf changed the document to make it appear as if she had performed a more thorough review, the agency said as it announced an order instituting an administrative proceeding against Wolf. The SEC said its staff spotted the alteration after Wells Fargo provided the document as part of the commission’s investigation. Wolf initially denied changing it, but later testified she had done so, the agency said. “Regardless of her motivation, her conduct was inconsistent with what the SEC expects of compliance professionals and what the law requires,” Daniel Hawke, chief of the SEC enforcement division’s market abuse unit, said in a statement. Steven Salky, a lawyer for Wolf, said she “did nothing wrong, and we look forward to clearing her of these baseless charges.” A Wells Fargo representative declined comment. In September, Well Fargo agreed to pay $5 million and admit wrongdoing to resolve charges it did not have adequate controls in place to prevent Prado from insider trading. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged Prado and Igor Cornelsen, a banker and fellow Brazilian, in January in connection with insider trading ahead of the news about the Burger King deal. Prosecutors alleged that Prado learned from a client that  private equity firm 3G Capital Partners planned to buy Burger King, and passed the news to Cornelsen, who had been prodding him for tips. The roughly $3.26 billion buyout was announced two weeks later and valued Burger King at $24 per share, 46 percent above its price before buyout rumors surfaced. Prosecutors said Cornelsen and Prado both traded illegally in Burger King, making respective profits of $1.68 million and $175,000. Neither Prado nor Cornelsen have appeared in U.S. court to face the criminal charges. Cornelson agreed in 2012 to pay $5.1 million to settle earlier SEC charges. The agency obtained a $5.63 million default judgment against Prado in January.

1005,WFC,Fitch: Wells Fargo 3Q'14 Results Remain Solid,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 15 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) reported $5.7 billion in  net income for a return on assets (ROA) of 1.4%, essentially unchanged from the  prior quarter, according to Fitch Ratings. Earnings were supported by higher  spread income and lower taxes, partially offset by increased loan loss  provisioning. Fitch views these results as consistent with WFC's credit profile,  with ratings that remain among the highest in the world.  Higher spread income was supported by earning asset growth, purchase accounting  accretion and one more day in the quarter. The net interest margin (NIM)  continued to contract a further 9 basis points (bps) in the third quarter of  2014 (3Q'14), reflecting deposit inflows and liquidity-related funding actions.  WFC issued $16.3 billion in liquidity-related long-term debt issuances in 3Q'14,  as well as some additional liquidity-related short-term funding. With regard to  LCR compliance, the company disclosed that it is now solidly over 100%.  Overall noninterest income was flat on a linked-quarter basis. Lower mortgage  banking revenues were offset by increases in net gains on debt securities and  over $700 million in net gains from equity investments, primarily from Norwest  Venture Partners. These revenues combined with investment banking and trading  revenues comprised a relatively manageable 7% of total revenues in 3Q'14. The  contribution from these businesses is well below some of WFC's larger bank  peers, but these items can still be a volatile line item for WFC. The  contribution has ranged from 3.5% of total revenues in 2Q'12, to over 8% in  1Q'14. Expenses were up slightly on a sequential basis reflecting higher operating  losses related to litigation accruals and an increase in outside professional  services, partially offset by lower personnel expenses. WFC's lower tax expense  was attributed to charitable donations of appreciated securities.  WFC reported a smaller reserve release on a sequential basis of $300 million as  compared to $500 million last quarter. Net charge-offs (NCOs) reflected  continuing asset quality improvement and declined 7% to just 32bps, while  provision expenses increased 70%. WFC expects future reserve releases, absent a  significant deterioration in economic conditions.  Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III Advanced Approach increased 32bps  to a solid 10.46% at quarter-end.

1006,WFC,Exclusive: Wells Fargo to shut its 'dark pool' as demand falls,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo (WFC.N) is closing down its alternative trading system, or “dark pool,” due to decreased customer demand, the company said on Thursday.  The San Francisco-based bank will still offer its clients a full suite of electronic trading tools to help them execute orders, but will stop offering access to the company’s dark pool on Friday, a spokeswoman from the bank told Reuters.     “Our products are customized to fit client trading objectives and the products we offer are aligned with client demand. Effective October 17, our product suite no longer includes the Wells Fargo Liquidity Crosser,” the bank said in a statement.  Dark pools are electronic broker-run electronic trading venues, and every big bank has one. They allow investors to trade shares anonymously and only make trading data available after a trade happens, reducing the chance that others in the market will catch wind of the buyer’s or seller’s intentions and move the price against them. The move by Wells Fargo comes as regulatory scrutiny over dark pools has intensified over concerns about the lack of transparency in the trading venues. Several regulators have ongoing probes into dark pool operators and New York’s attorney general has launched a lawsuit accusing Barclays PLC of securities fraud for activities related to its dark pool.  Wells Fargo said the closure of its dark pool was not due to increased regulatory scrutiny, but rather a lack of demand. Wells Fargo’s dark pool ranks 32nd out of 41 alternative trading systems tracked by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in terms of volume. For the week of Sept. 22, the Wells pool traded just under 7 million shares. By comparison, Credit Suisse’s dark pool, at the top of the list, traded just under 350 million shares.  With over 40 dark pools competing for much of the same order flow along with 11 U.S. stock exchanges, critics say the venues add to the fragmentation of the market, which increases complexity and costs for market participants. Wells Fargo said it would still be routing orders to other dark pools for any customer that wishes it to do so.

Broker Zelda Benson joined Wells Fargo in Seal Beach, California from Ameriprise Financial Inc, where she managed $132 million in client assets. Benson, a registered broker with Ameriprise since 1987, moved to Wells Fargo on Oct. 16. Amerprise did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Broker James Harris moved to Wells Fargo in Albany, Georgia from Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch, where he managed $102 million in assets. Harris joined Wells Fargo on Sept. 16 after a decade working for Merrill Lynch. Before that he worked at Morgan Keegan & Co and Wachovia Securities. A Merrill Lynch spokeswoman confirmed that Harris had left the firm but declined to comment further. Wells Fargo employed 15,163 advisers as of Sept. 30, slightly less than the firm reported having in the second quarter this year. Wells Fargo remains the second largest U.S. brokerage after Morgan Stanley, which reported it employed 16,162 brokers as of Sept. 30. Despite the slight dip, Wells Fargo also reported total client brokerage assets were up 8 percent from the third quarter of 2013, to $1.4 trillion.

1008,WFC,US banks capitalise on deserted euro bond market,"* Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo target supply-starved investors * Non-eurozone banks dominate as cheap ECB loans keep domestics sidelined By Aimee Donnellan LONDON, Oct 22 (IFR) - Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo filled the void in the euro senior unsecured bond market on Wednesday, coming with new deals in a space abandoned by eurozone banks that have opted for covered bonds and cheaper central bank funding instead. Senior unsecured supply from eurozone’s banks has plummeted since the summer, with the region’s lenders having sold only a paltry 3bn from September till now. This compares to UK, US, Swiss and Nordic issuers that have sold over 15bn in the same period. “The TLTRO is offering such cheap funding that there is no compulsion from the region’s banks to fund or pre-fund this year,” said a syndicate banker. “We’re seeing a total reversal in the eurozone/non-eurozone issuance volumes in the past few months. Although overall the volumes are the same this year as last, that total used to be made up 80%/20% in favour of eurozone banks which is no longer the case.” From September, eurozone banks have been able to borrow up to 400bn through the European Central Bank’s TLTRO, paying just 0.25% a year for the privilege - well below what they would pay to borrow in the senior unsecured market. But this bargain basement funding has not kept banks completely sidelined from the market. In the past two months, eurozone covered bond issuance has ramped up, with banks selling some 8.7bn, often at levels below the mid-swaps money market benchmark. However, the secured funding volumes are still significantly below the figures from last year, when the region’s banks issued over 13.5bn in the same period. “We have definitely seen some activity in the covered bond market, which is providing extremely cheap funding to a wide range of eurozone banks,” said Alexandra MacMahon, head of EMEA financial institutions debt capital markets at Citigroup. “However, the market has gone a bit quiet because of the AQR,” added MacMahon, who is expecting issuers to spend time updating their programmes before accessing the market again. This quiet period has meant that demand is even greater than usual for US banks like Citigroup, which sold a 1.5bn seven-year bond at mid-swaps plus 75bp on Monday. That deal, thanks to a favourable move in the basis swap, meant it priced inside of where Citigroup would have priced a similar bond in its home market. On Wednesday, the lack of euro area supply is also helping Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, which have already unearthed a combined 5bn for their deals. Goldman Sachs is poised to price a five-year senior floating rate note at the same level it would price a dollar bond. The US investment bank began testing investor interest at three-month Euribor plus 80bp area, which was revised down to plus 75bp area as demand topped 1.5bn. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo is to print its seven-year euro senior benchmark at mid-swaps plus 55bp area, having first tested interest in the 60s.

1009,WFC,Home comfort helps Harman fly high at Sea Island,"(Reuters) - Brian Harman took advantage of home comforts, ideal weather and a red-hot putter as he charged into a share of the lead in Thursday’s opening round of the $5.6 million McGladrey Classic at Sea Island in Georgia. The diminutive American left-hander, who won his first PGA Tour title at the John Deere Classic in July, mixed six birdies with a lone bogey on the way to a sparkling five-under-par 65 in the third event of the 2014-15 season. Harman birdied four of his last seven holes on the Seaside Course to end the day level with compatriots Michael Thompson, Will MacKenzie and double heart-transplant recipient Erik Compton. Pencil-slim American Chesson Hadley, the PGA Tour’s Rookie of the Year for the 2013-14 season, was among a group of eight players who opened with 66s. Harman, born in nearby Savannah and a resident at Sea Island, rebounded strongly from a bogey on his fifth hole of the day, the par-four 14th, to surge into a four-way tie at the top of the leaderboard. “I got off to a little bit of a shaky start but finally figured it out and made some good swings, made some putts and felt really good,” the 27-year-old told Golf Channel. The short five-minute commute from his home to the golf course was another huge bonus for Harman. “It’s great,” he smiled. “It’s the only tournament of the year I get to sleep in my own bed. I’m fortunate to be lucky enough to live down here and even more fortunate to have a tournament in my back yard.” Thompson, like Harman, flourished on the ultra-smooth greens at Sea Island. “My putter was hot today,” said the 29-year-old from Arizona whose only PGA Tour victory came at the 2013 Honda Classic. “I put in some good work the past couple of days on the green ... and my speed was awesome today. “When that happens, it’s fun to play golf because you’re making putts. I just had a few lucky breaks which kept me in it, because I hit some wayward shots today but it was a good day of golf.” American world number nine Matt Kuchar, the highest-ranked player in the field, opened with a 67 while tournament host Davis Love III, who has won 20 times on the PGA Tour, carded a 71. Fellow American Chris Kirk, who won last year’s McGladrey Classic by one shot, launched his title defense with a bogey-free 68.

1010,WFC,British asset-backed lender Burdale given Wells Fargo makeover,"LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo is renaming its British asset-backed lending business Burdale Financial as Wells Fargo Capital Finance after the company’s strong growth in the two years it has been owned by the U.S. bank. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, the world’s biggest bank by market value, said the move will aid its growth push in Britain and help it to support U.S. clients with overseas financial needs and European customers. Burdale, founded in 1992, was bought by Wells from Bank of Ireland for about 690 million euros ($876 million) in February 2012 and now has about 40 staff, up from 28 at the time of the takeover. Wells said Burdale’s client base has doubled and lending has more than doubled since the acquisition, though it does not break out revenue for the unit. The business provides loans of 10 million pounds ($16 million) or more that are backed by assets such as land, buildings, machinery or inventory. Companies that take asset-backed loans include manufacturers, retailers and technology firms, often to fund growth or refinance, or to turnaround businesses or make acquisitions. Most of Wells Fargo’s revenue comes from the United States. Its number of staff in Europe, Middle East and Africa - mostly based in Britain - had increased to 930 in May from about 600 at the start of 2012 after targeting wholesale services for large and medium-sized U.S. companies and European businesses active in the United States.

Bank of America said it hired 155 financial advisers in the third quarter, ended Sept. 30, bringing its “Thundering Herd,” as the firm’s adviser force is called, to 14,000. Miami-based brokers Eugene Montoya, Francisco de la Camara, Mario Baro and Kevin Montoya, nearly all of whom had spent several decades at Merrill, left for Wells Fargo Advisors  on Sept. 30, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman confirmed. Also, broker Raymond L. George left Merrill Lynch for Morgan Stanley, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said. His departure came shortly after the Miami group left. George, who had been with Merrill for about 23 years, joined Morgan Stanley’s office in Garden City, New York, according to records with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. A Merrill spokeswoman confirmed that both the Miami group and George left the firm. However, neither she nor the Morgan Stanley spokeswoman commented on George’s production at Merrill. Eugene Montoya, de la Camara and Baro collectively managed at least $390 million in assets at Merrill, the Wells Fargo spokeswoman confirmed. She could not provide information on Kevin Montoya’s assets under management.

1013,WFC,Wells Fargo says in settlement talks in US mortgage insurance case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Wednesday it is in discussions with the U.S. government to resolve a lawsuit accusing the nation’s largest mortgage lender of cheating taxpayers by submitting ineligible home loans to a federal insurance program. Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets, disclosed the talks in a quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  In October 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice sued the San Francisco-based bank, saying it failed to report more than 6,000 loans that did not meet requirements for insurance under the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and failed to properly review early payment defaults. The government said this caused the FHA to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars in claims on loans that did not qualify for insurance. Wells Fargo asked a federal judge in Washington, D.C. shortly after the complaint was filed to excuse it from the Justice Department’s claims, but was rebuffed in 2013. The bank’s appeal also failed.  At a June hearing in New York, a Justice Department lawyer said the bank and the government had tried several times to resolve their differences but were unsuccessful. Jennifer Queliz, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan, declined comment.  Wells Fargo is not the only big bank to face such allegations. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc and Deutsche Bank AG all reached settlements with the Justice Department over related issues in recent years.  The bank lowered its estimate of projected litigation-related losses to as much as $950 million above the sum already set aside at the end of September. That is down from an estimated $1.2 billion at the end of June, according to the SEC filing. Wells Fargo shares rose 1.1 percent to $53.48.

Wells Fargo, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank company, has told brokers who sell investment plans and bankers who sell loans and mortgages to refer clients with household assets of $2.5 million to each other, down from $5 million when the partnership plan began two years ago. The change was rolled out nationally in the past few weeks because of the program’s success at the higher threshold,  David Carroll, head of Wells’s Wealth, Brokerage & Retirement division said at a bank analyst conference in Boston on Thursday. Wells has booked $1.7 billion of loans, $2.2 billion of new brokerage assets and $1.4 billion of trust assets since the partnership plan began. “It is not an industry norm for traditional private bankers to play nice with brokers, but we are making it work very well,” Carroll said. By halving the wealth threshold, Wells nearly quadruples  client households eligible for referrals to 50,000 from 13,000 and doubles to $300 billion potential brokerage assets now kept outside the bank. The number of brokers with upscale clients eligible for referrals will jump to 8,200 from 5,800, and the number of advisers in the program will likely rise to 900 from 500, according to slides accompanying Carroll’s presentation.  On the flip side, only 11 percent of wealthy clients with Wells mortgages use the bank’s brokers and retirement advisers. Brokers’ resistance to selling jumbo mortgages and other bank products has been narrowing. Many initially resisted handing clients to bankers whose services might be less than premier, but interest income and fees from selling bank products are so high that Wells, Bank of America Corp, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG have rolled out lucrative bonus plans to encourage sales and referrals at brokerage units. More than 60 percent of Wells brokers have made loans to clients. Private bankers do not qualify for referral bonuses until they reach monthly sales quotas, but Carroll said his bankers and brokers are driven by “internal recognition for playing team ball” rather than by financial incentives. Wells’s private bank targets clients with $1 million to $50 million of household assets compared with brokers, who aim for households with $250,000 to $5 million. Carroll’s wealth sector is Well’s smallest unit but generated 23 percent of the bank’s $10.3 billion of fees and 52 percent of its net interest income last quarter. In 2015, the wealth businesses will spend about $250 million on product upgrades and training, areas that Carroll said have been neglected. The division aims for average profit margin over the next five years in the mid-20-percent level, down from the high 20s before the 2008 financial crisis, he said.

Many initially resisted handing clients to bankers whose services might be less than premier, but interest income and fees from selling bank products are so high that Wells, Bank of America Corp, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG have rolled out lucrative bonus plans to encourage sales and referrals at brokerage units.  More than 60 percent of Wells brokers have made loans to clients. Private bankers do not qualify for referral bonuses until they reach monthly sales quotas, but Carroll said his bankers and brokers are driven by “internal recognition for playing team ball” rather than by financial incentives. Wells’s private bank targets clients with $1 million to $50 million of household assets compared with brokers, who aim for households with $250,000 to $5 million. Carroll’s wealth sector is Well’s smallest unit, generating 17 percent of the bank’s revenue and 9 percent of its profit last quarter.  In 2015, the wealth businesses will spend about $250 million on product upgrades and training, areas that Carroll said have been neglected. The division aims for average profit margin over the next five years in the mid-20-percent level, down from the high 20s before the 2008 financial crisis, he said.

1026,WFC,"Berkshire invests in Express Scripts, makes confidential disclosure","Nov 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  disclosed a new stake in healthcare management company Express Scripts Holding Co and shed its stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co, among several changes in its stock investments during the third quarter. In a regulatory filing, Berkshire also revealed it has disclosed confidential information about its investments to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC often allows Buffett to do this to let him amass a large investment without worrying about copycat investors.  Berkshire disclosed last week that it had bought more than $2.3 billion of equity securities in the third quarter. Berkshire bought 449,489 shares of Express Scripts in the quarter, making it among the smallest holdings in its portfolio. Shares of Express Scripts rose 0.4 percent in after-hours trading to $78.20. Companies’ shares often rise when Berkshire reveals new investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett. In contrast, Berkshire eliminated its stake in Deere, which it had originally bought two years ago. Berkshire did not disclose what investments were made by Buffett’s portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Buffett has said he generally makes Berkshire’s larger investments such as Wells Fargo & Co and Coca-Cola Co , while Combs or Weschler, who have smaller sums to invest, make other investments, especially in sectors he is less familiar with. Other changes to Berkshire’s stock portfolio simply adjusted already-existing positions. Berkshire raised its share stakes in several companies including DirecTV, General Motors, MasterCard and Suncor Energy. It also cut its share stakes in Bank of New York Mellon, ConocoPhillips, National Oilwell Varco and Phillips 66. U.S. regulators require large investors each quarter to disclose their stock holdings, offering a window to their investment strategies. The view is limited because investors are not required to list short positions, foreign holdings and bonds, and because it reflects the just-completed quarter. Berkshire ended September with about $118.9 billion of equities, the vast majority of which are on U.S. exchanges. It also owns more than 80 businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance to railroads.

Douglas Baruch, a lawyer for Wells Fargo, told a federal judge in Manhattan that while the parties would not rule out a settlement, both sides were prepared to resume litigating after putting the case on hold since July. “The parties are no longer as optimistic as they once were,” he said.

At Tuesday’s hearing, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman expressed dismay that Wells Fargo and the government did not ask his approval in July to formally put the case on hold to pursue settlement talks.

1039,WFC,U.S. Fed spots flaws in Wells Fargo resolution plan,"WASHINGTON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators said on Tuesday that Wells Fargo & Co needed to improve a crisis plan showing how it could be shut down without causing financial mayhem, but its plan drew less harsh criticism than those of other banks. Large U.S. banks must submit the so-called living wills to spell out how they can enter bankruptcy without triggering the need for costly taxpayer bailouts that were rampant during the 2007-09 financial crisis. The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said the bank’s 2014 plan was an improvement over last year’s plan, but that it still needed work. In August, the same two agencies blasted the living wills submitted by 11 other big banks, saying they were overly optimistic and allowed the banks to be too complex.

1040,WFC,Lawsuit accuses Wells Fargo of biased lending in Chicago area,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co was sued on Friday by Cook County, Illinois, which accused the largest U.S. mortgage lender of targeting black, Hispanic and female borrowers with predatory and discriminatory lending in the Chicago area. The lawsuit is the latest accusing major banks of biased mortgage lending that harmed major American cities, such as Los Angeles, Miami and Baltimore, and prolonged the nation’s housing crisis. These lawsuits have had mixed success.  According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Chicago, which is part of Cook County and the third-most populous U.S. city, Wells Fargo has for more than a decade discriminated against minority and female borrowers in the region, with a goal of maximizing profit. The 152-page complaint said the bank targeted borrowers from the time loans were made through foreclosure through “equity stripping,” which includes the imposition of inflated or unnecessary rates and fees, as well as penalties to refinance. Cook County said Wells Fargo’s “deliberate” and “egregious” activities affected at least 26,000 borrowers, eroded the county’s property tax base, and forced the county to spend more to combat blight from abandoned properties. It said damages may total $300 million or more. The county is seeking a halt to Wells Fargo’s alleged wrongful practices, as well as compensatory and punitive damages. Its lawsuit also targets practices at the former Wachovia Corp, which Wells Fargo bought at the end of 2008. Chris Hammond, a Wells Fargo spokesman, declined to comment.

1046,WFC,Ally Financial overtakes Wells Fargo as top U.S. auto lender,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ally Financial Inc (ALLY.N) became the largest U.S. retail auto lender in the third quarter, displacing Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) for the first time since the start of 2013, according to a report from Experian Automotive on Monday. Much of Ally’s growth came from financing used car sales, an area where the former in-house finance arm of General Motors Co (GM.N) has been aggressively expanding. The lender extended a record amount of used car loans in the third quarter.  In recent years, banks expanded in the used car market as carmakers’ in-house finance arms came to dominate the new car market. In the third quarter, 54.1 percent of used car purchases were financed with a loan, a record high.  Banks and other lenders have also been willing to finance larger amounts for used car purchases. The average size of a used car loan in the third quarter was up nearly 4 percent from a year earlier to $18,576, an all-time high, even as used car prices fell in the quarter, according to the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index. Focusing on consumers buying used cars is riskier for banks because these borrowers tend to have lower credit scores and are more likely to default. The average credit score for a borrower buying a used car in the quarter was 650, compared with 713 for those buying a new car. Credit scores can range from 300 to 850, and scores below 600 are considered subprime by Experian Automotive.   Banks are accepting lower compensation for the increased credit risk. Interest rates for used car loans across the industry fell 0.09 percentage points to 8.54 percent, while rates for new car loans rose 0.20 percentage points to 4.47 percent in the third quarter.  As a group, banks extended 2.1 percent more auto loans to subprime borrowers in the quarter, the most of any type of lender.

1049,WFC,"Homeowners, Wells Fargo head to trial over mortgage fees","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, is set to go to trial on Monday as homeowners seek to recoup about $629 million for alleged overcharges by a company once owned by Wachovia Corp. Jury selection is scheduled to begin in federal court in Manhattan in a long-running class-action lawsuit concerning HomEq Servicing, a subprime mortgage servicer. The lawsuit was filed in 2001 on behalf of borrowers whose mortgages were owned or serviced by HomEq or the lender whose loans it was established to manage, Money Store. Wachovia in 2006 sold HomEq to Barclays Plc, which in turn in 2010 sold the mortgage servicing business to Ocwen Financial Corp. Wells Fargo bought Wachovia at the end of 2008 and thus never owned HomEq, but a spokesman confirmed it remained liable for some claims raised in the lawsuit. Ocwen in a statement said it did not have similar liability. Barclays  declined to comment. The lawsuit filed by Joseph Mazzei, a California resident, contends that HomEq kept charging borrowers monthly late fees even after their mortgages went into default, making the full amounts owed immediately due. It also said HomEq violated its contracts by charging attorneys’ fees in foreclosure and bankruptcy and splitting them with a nonlawyer, specifically a unit of Fidelity National Information Services Inc. Sharing fees in this manner is illegal throughout the country, the lawsuit said. In an October court filing, a damages expert for the plaintiffs estimated damages at $59.3 million for late fees and $282.7 million for attorneys’ fees, plus pre-judgment interest of $287.4 million. “We strongly disagree with and dispute the plaintiff’s claims and legal arguments, which relate to acts that occurred at a legacy company more than a decade ago, and are prepared to present our case in court.” Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said.

1055,WFC,Wells to raise minimum stock commission size for FAs,"(Reuters) - When the almost 11,000 financial advisers in Wells Fargo & Co’s branch brokerage system get their 2015 compensation plan on Wednesday they may grimace at one change that could hit their pay, or cost their customers a little more. Wells is raising the minimum commission size on which it will allow brokers to be paid on a stock trade to $125 from $95, according to people familiar with the plan. Wells brokers, who receive 50 percent of most of the commissions they charge, risk customer backlash for the higher charge.  A $30 rise in the so-called ticket charge may not sound egregious but transactions can quickly add up. For example, a broker closing out a $400,000 managed account portfolio of a deceased client or rebalancing positions could easily execute 50 transactions, costing an extra $1,500, said one of the sources. Brokers at Wells and other full-service firms still have leeway to offer discounts to selected clients from published rates, but all firms are putting constraints on behaviors that they say erode profitability.  Morgan Stanley, the largest U.S. brokerage firm with more than 16,000 advisers, for example, does not credit brokers for purchases or sales of securities that trade below $1 a share or on products, other than options, that have commissions under $100 a trade, according to its 2015 compensation plan.  Wells is the last of the four big U.S. brokerage firms to issue its annual compensation plan, a document that can run dozens of pages and is scrutinized internally and at competitors to see where the most attractive deals lie and what sales behaviors are being encouraged or discouraged. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch Wealth Management and UBS Wealth Management Americas  distributed plans in the past month that offer inducements for working on teams and penalties for discounting fees and commissions and for working with small accounts. In addition to raising its compensable trading ticket size, the new Wells plan will make it more remunerative for lower-producing brokers to work on teams, the sources said. Some Wells brokers have complained that the firm was constraining their ability to manage their teams. Full-service firms are promoting teams as a superior way to handle the sophisticated needs of wealthy clients, with the added benefit of making it harder for teams to bolt en masse to competitors.

Wells Fargo uncovered the problem through routine compliance testing, according to the settlement document. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment.

1058,WFC,Wells Fargo faces payout after $54.8 million loan fee verdict,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. homeowners suing mortgage companies once owned by a bank Wells Fargo & Co later acquired won a $54.8 million verdict on Friday in a class action over excessive fees. The verdict, by a federal jury in Manhattan, came in a long-running lawsuit by borrowers whose mortgages were owned or serviced by HomEq Serving or the lender whose loans it was established to manage, the now-defunct The Money Store. Wells Fargo said afterward that it disagreed with the jury’s decision and would likely seek further court review. A lawyer for the homeowners, Moshe Horn, said in a statement that he was “thrilled our clients finally had our day in court.” Homeowners, who sued in 2001, had sought to recoup about $629 million for alleged overcharges and interest, according to an October court filing by a damages expert for the plaintiffs. The lawsuit was filed by homeowner Joseph Mazzei, who contends that The Money Store and HomEq kept charging borrowers monthly late fees even after their mortgages went into default. According to court records, the jury found the mortgage companies liable for the late fees but not liable on a separate question of whether the companies mishandled attorney fees. Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said in a statement that while the bank would likely seek a review of the part of the case it lost, “We are pleased that the jury rejected a significant portion of the plaintiff’s claims.” Mazzei was awarded $133.80 plus interest, records showed.  If the verdict stands, the $54.8 million will be split up among the class at a later date. Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, never owned either defendant. Wells Fargo in 2008 acquired Wachovia, which had owned HomEq. The Money Store was owned by First Union, which later became part of Wachovia. First Union shut down The Money Store in 2000 because of losses. A New Jersey mortgage lender bought The Money Store’s name in 2006 and has continued using it. The case is Mazzei v.

1065,WFC,U.S. credit union regulator sues Wells Fargo over crisis-era trusts,"(Reuters) - The U.S. credit union regulator sued Wells Fargo & Co Tuesday, saying the bank failed to fulfill its duties as a trustee for certain residential mortgage-backed securities trusts that soured and brought down five credit unions. The lawsuit, filed by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) in a federal court in Manhattan, seeks a jury trial, damages and full compensation for legal costs associated with the case. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit. The NCUA said it is bringing the case after five credit unions bought about $2.5 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities issued from trusts between 2004 and 2007.  Those underlying loans soured, as borrowers began to default on their mortgage payments and lost their homes to foreclosure.  The losses on these investments, the NCUA said, eventually led those five credit unions to fail. Regulators said Wells Fargo, as trustee for those trusts, had obligations under the law to correct problems with the loans and to protect the credit unions’ interests. The NCUA said the bank was supposed to review the mortgage files, identify cases where the files had problems such as the lack of a title chain, and certify the files were complete.  The law also requires trustees to take certain steps to protect trust investors. If, for instance, there is a breach of the representations and warranties for the loans, then the trustee must notify the various parties and make an effort to “cure, substitute or repurchase the defective mortgage loans,” the NCUA said.

1070,WFC,Wells Fargo fourth quarter profit rises; watching energy exposure,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, the fourth largest U.S. bank by assets, reported a slight increase in quarterly profit on Wednesday as it earned more from credit cards and corporate loans. Credit cards, one of Wells Fargo’s major areas of expansion, were a bright spot as fees rose 12 percent to $925 million in the fourth quarter. Outstanding balances increased 16 percent to $31.1 billion, after its purchase of the loan portfolio of Dillard’s Inc. One of the fastest-growing industries in its loan book in recent quarters has been energy. On a conference call with analysts, finance chief John Shrewsberry downplayed the effects that the sharp fall in oil prices would have on the bank’s energy customers. “Nothing obviously has revealed itself yet,” said Shrewsberry. He added that the bank did not set aside any money in the quarter for possible energy loan defaults, but was reviewing customers’ creditworthiness on a loan-by-loan basis.  Commercial and industrial loans jumped 15 percent to $271.8 billion, much of it coming from an increase in lending to other financial companies, including $6.5 billion in loans to finance the sale of a Wells Fargo student loan portfolio to Navient Corp. That sale resulted in a $217 million gain for the bank in the quarter.  Net interest income, a measure of overall profit from lending, was up 3.5 percent to $11.2 billion from the same period a year earlier. Core loans were up 8 percent from the fourth quarter of 2013. Total net income for common shareholders was $5.38 billion, or $1.02 per share, up incrementally from a year earlier and in line with estimates from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, reported a 4 percent fall in income from that unit. The bank made $44 billion in home loans in the quarter, 12 percent less than a year ago and a bigger drop than the one reported by rival JP Morgan Chase & Co. Shrewsberry said he expected mortgage volumes in the first quarter to be relatively constant, though they could get a boost if mortgage rates stay low.  Wells Fargo’s shares were down 1.7 percent to $50.97, as the broader market tumbled. The bank’s stock jumped by 21 percent in 2014, triple the rise of the KBW index of bank stocks.

1071,WFC,Fitch: Wells Fargo 4Q'14 Results Consistently Solid,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 14 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) reported $5.7 billion in  net income for a Return on Assets (ROA) of 1.36%, essentially unchanged from the  prior quarter. Earnings were supported by higher spread income and lower taxes,  partially offset by increased loan loss provisioning and higher noninterest  expenses. Fitch Ratings views these results as consistent with WFC's credit  profile, with ratings that remain among the highest in the world, supported  primarily by its superior earnings profile. WFC's more commercial bank-focused  business model continues to help set itself apart from its large bank peers,  with less exposure to volatile capital markets revenues and while not immune,  much lower litigation-related expenses than other large bank peers. Higher spread income was supported by average earning asset growth of 3%  linked-quarter. The net interest margin (NIM) contracted 2bps in 4Q'14, a level  below the prior quarters NIM compression. The compression was attributed to last  quarter's liquidity-related actions and deposit growth. WFC continues to report  very strong core deposit growth, up 7% from a year ago. WFC reported strong core loan growth in 4Q'14, driven by organic growth, $6.5  billion in financing related to the sale of government guaranteed student loans,  and the acquisition of Dillard's credit card portfolio. Somewhat offsetting  this, auto growth slowed during the quarter. Over the prior four quarters, this  book had been growing on average by about a $1.4 billion a quarter. However,  citing the company's risk and price discipline in a competitive market  environment, automobile loans increased by roughly $500 million. Overall noninterest income was flat on a linked-quarter basis. Higher investment  banking fees, a $217 million gain on the sale of student loans, and higher trust  and investment fees were offset by lower deposit service charges, mortgage  banking revenues and market-sensitive revenues.  Mortgage banking revenues declined 7% on a sequential basis reflecting a  typically slow quarter. However, with the drop in the 10 year in mid-October and  then again in December, this helped lead to an increase in the application  pipeline, with refinancings accounting for 52% of applications, which represents  a nice uptick over prior quarters.  Market-sensitive revenues, which include gains and losses on equity investments,  trading activities, and debt securities, declined 35%, following a strong 3Q'14  in which WFC realized over $700 million in net gains from equity investments,  primarily from Norwest Venture Partners. Period-end trading assets increased by  $10.5 billion or 16% on increased inventory for market making activity. Despite  the increase, trading assets still only account for less than 5% of total  assets, a level well below other large bank peers. Further, the market-sensitive  revenues combined with investment banking fees, were around 6% of total  revenues; once again well below the average for Bank of America, Citi and JPM,  who typically average 25% of revenues. Expenses were up 3% on a sequential basis reflecting higher personnel expenses,  primarily due to higher deferred compensation costs (which are earnings neutral  as offset in trading revenues), and increased equipment expenses and outside  professional fees. This was partially offset by lower operating losses related  to lower litigation accruals. WFC expects to operate within its targeted  efficiency range of 55% to 59% in 2015.  WFC noted that no oil-related charges were incurred in 4Q'14, and gave more  specific information related to energy-related exposure. Lending to oil and gas  businesses totaled around $17 billion (or 2% of total loans), while securities  classified as either trading or available for sale accounted for less than $1.5  billion. These exposures together comprised a manageable 13% of Common Equity  Tier 1 under Basel III. WFC also generates revenues from debt and equity  underwritings, and loan syndication fees. These fees have averaged around $100  million to $300 million over the last several years, a relatively small amount  in the context of quarterly earnings of over $5 billion.  WFC reported a smaller reserve release on a sequential basis of $250 million as  compared to $300 million last quarter. Net charge-offs (NCOs) reflected a still  benign credit environment at just 34bps, up slightly on lower recoveries in  Wholesale. Due primarily to loan growth, provision expenses increased 32%  sequentially. WFC indicated that future loan loss reserve levels will depend on  loan growth and mix, portfolio performance, and general economic conditions.  The estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III Advanced Approach, fully  phased-in, fell 3bps to a still solid 10.44% at quarter-end. The linked-quarter  decline was due to balance sheet growth.

1072,WFC,Wells Fargo examines its energy loans after oil-price drop,"NEW YORK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, one of the biggest lenders to U.S. energy companies, is reviewing each of its loans to the sector in the wake of oil prices tumbling 60 percent since last summer, executives said Wednesday. The bank did not think its energy loan portfolio was at risk enough to justify setting aside any money in the fourth quarter to cover possible defaults, Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told analysts on a Wednesday conference call, adding that energy represented only 2 percent of the banks outstanding loans. He said he expected future loan demand in the industry would “certainly be down.” Energy clients are taking “the appropriate evasive actions,” including preserving cash, cutting costs and trimming debt in light of the plunging oil prices, Shrewsberry said. “We’re ... going customer by customer and working through each situation to figure out what this drop means to them,” Shrewsberry said. In recent years, the San Francisco-based bank has been one of the beneficiaries of U.S. shale oil and gas discoveries and the fracking boom. It has 500 relationships with energy companies that range from lending money to underwriting debt to taking firms public. The bank has invested around $500 million through funds and direct stakes, executives said at the bank’s May 2014 investor day. Wells Fargo’s revenue from these clients has grown steadily to $1.04 billion in 2013 from $690 million in 2011. Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf told analysts to focus on the positive aspects of the drop in oil prices like more discretionary income for U.S. consumers. Lower energy prices also could benefit Wells Fargo’s merchant banking group as it looks to take part in recapitalizing oil and gas companies that run into trouble or acquiring energy assets from firms that need to sell them quickly, Shrewsberry said in a separate interview with Reuters. “That could be an interesting opportunity as things go forward,” Shrewsberry said. Wells Fargo, the fourth largest U.S. bank by assets, reported a slight increase in quarterly profit earlier Wednesday as it earned more from credit cards and corporate loans.

The CFPB said the former title company, Genuine Title, would give the banks’ loan officers cash, marketing materials and other consumer information in exchange for business referrals. In addition to charging the two banks, the CFPB also announced it was charging a former Wells Fargo employee, Todd Cohen, and his wife, Elaine Oliphant Cohen, for their involvement in the alleged scheme. Cohen and his wife are also settling, and paying a $30,000 penalty. “These banks allowed their loan officers to focus on their own illegal financial gain rather than on treating consumers fairly. Our action today to address these practices should serve as a warning for all those in the mortgage market,” CFPB Director Richard Cordray said in a statement on Thursday. A Wells Fargo spokesman said the bank had taken “strong corrective action” as a result of the issue. It had terminated involved staff, and said it would improve the monitoring of its processes and its team members. JPMorgan said that “these former employees clearly violated our policies, procedures and training”. Attorneys for Cohen and Oliphant Cohen could not be immediately reached.

1083,WFC,Judge rules for Wells Fargo in NY challenge over mortgage settlement,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday rejected allegations by the New York state attorney general that Wells Fargo was violating the $25 billion mortgage settlement that federal and state authorities reached with five banks in 2012. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer described Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s allegations as “so insubstantial” that the state failed to allege a breach of the agreement.  In 2013, Schneiderman accused Wells Fargo of failing to comply with several mortgage servicing standards as prescribed by the earlier settlement.  Under the February 2012 deal, Wells, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc and Ally Financial agreed to pay billions in help to homeowners and reform their mortgage servicing operations in order to atone for abuses in processing foreclosures as the housing market collapsed. By spring 2013, Schneiderman said his office had documented hundreds of violations of the deal by Wells Fargo and in October asked the federal judge overseeing the settlement to force Wells to comply with its terms. New York said the bank was not responding to some struggling borrowers who were seeking loan modifications as quickly as timetables under the settlement required.  In the Monday order, the judge said New York’s allegations covered less than .022 percent of New York loans serviced by Wells Fargo, and that a monitor appointed to oversee the settlement could address those issues.  The settlement “does not require absolute perfection in loan servicing,” Collyer wrote. She said allowing New York to go to court over their concerns “would open the floodgates to lawsuits, running afoul of the core purpose of the Consent Judgment––to resolve problems in the mortgage industry with monitoring and compliance and without litigation.” Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said the bank was gratified the court has denied the New York Attorney General’s motion.

1096,WFC,"Ex-Wells Fargo employees to face insider trading trial, judge rules","NEW YORK (Reuters) - An administrative judge has cleared the way for U.S. regulators to take two former Wells Fargo & Co employees to trial in a closely watched case testing the limits of insider trading laws. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Law Judge Jason Patil in an order Wednesday called it an “exceedingly close matter” of whether a recent federal appellate court ruling on insider trading required tossing the charges against Gregory Bolan and Joseph Ruggieri. The SEC alleged that Bolan, a research analyst, tipped Ruggieri, a trader, about upcoming upgrades and downgrades in ratings of various companies, allowing Ruggieri to make more than $117,000 in profits for Wells Fargo. The SEC, which brought the case in September, said Bolan also tipped off a friend, who was able to reap $10,000. The friend has since died. Bolan and Ruggieri had argued the case should be dismissed following a decision in December by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York. While Bolan and Ruggieri raised “persuasive counterpoints,” Patil said “deciding those points calls for the weighing of evidence and balancing of probabilities” which would require testimony. Absent an agreement by the SEC and defendants for a limited evidentiary hearing, the ruling clears the way for a March 30 non-jury administrative trial in New York. Lawyers for Ruggieri and Bolan said they were encouraged that the judge viewed the issue as a close call. Paul Ryan, Ruggieri’s lawyer, said he was “confident that Mr. Ruggieri will be fully vindicated after the judge hears the facts.” An SEC spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The 2nd Circuit, reversing the convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, ruled that authorities must prove a trader knew the source of a tip received a benefit in exchange for the information. The court also narrowed what constitutes a benefit, saying it must be of “some consequence.” The 2nd Circuit said it cannot be just friendship but must be a “meaningfully close relationship” suggesting a quid pro quo. Defense lawyers argued the SEC’s alleged benefits to Bolan, friendship and positive job feedback from Ruggieri, were insufficient. Previously, the SEC argued the ruling did not apply, but Patil this month ruled the SEC would need to establish Bolan received a benefit.

1099,WFC,"WRAPUP 3-Buffett looks to succession, signals future growth problem","(Recasts headline) By Luciana Lopez, Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - In his 50 years at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Warren Buffett has transformed a failing textile company into a sprawling conglomerate that has vastly outperformed most of the rest of corporate America. But he now says: Do not expect a repeat of that outperformance in the next 50. In the 84-year-old’s annual shareholder letter released on Saturday, Buffett said Berkshire has grown so large - 751,000 times its original net worth per share - that the future pace of gains “will not come close” to those of the past. “The numbers have become too big,” Buffett wrote. “I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company, but our advantage, if any, won’t be great.” Within 10 to 20 years, Buffett said, Berkshire’s girth could require whoever then runs the Omaha, Nebraska-based company to consider steps he has resisted, such as paying dividends or conducting “massive” share repurchases. Buffett, also addressing one of the more pressing topics at Berkshire, said he and his board of directors “believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO,” likely for a decade or more, and who in some respects “will do a better job than I am doing.” While Buffett did not name that person, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 91, said Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, two top Buffett lieutenants, would be prime candidates. Abel, 52, runs Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Jain, 63, has been Buffett’s top insurance executive for three decades. A successor could also be female: Buffett said “gender should never decide who becomes CEO.” And Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who run some Berkshire investments, “can be of particular help to the CEO in evaluating acquisitions,” he added. “You’ve got such good candidates,” said Thomas Russo, a principal at Gardner, Russo & Gardner, which invests 12 percent of its $10 billion of assets in Berkshire. “I think they’ll adopt a different capital structure approach, which will include a healthy, healthy large dividend.” Buffett is preparing in May to celebrate 50 years of running Berkshire, whose market value is now $363 billion. On Saturday, Berkshire also reported a 17 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit, to $4.16 billion, or $2,529 per Class A share, from $4.99 billion, or $3,035, a year ago, as investment gains and results from insurance underwriting declined. Operating profit rose 5 percent to $3.96 billion, or $2,412 per share, from $3.78 billion, or $2,297. For all of 2014, profit rose 2 percent to $19.87 billion, while operating profit increased 9 percent to $16.55 billion. Revenue rose 7 percent $194.67 billion. Book value per share, which Buffett considers a good measure of Berkshire’s worth, rose 8.3 percent to $146,186 but lagged gains in the Standard & Poor’s 500 for the fifth time in six years. Despite the big numbers, Berkshire had some problems. Buffett lamented the performance of the BNSF railroad, saying it “disappointed many of its customers” with congestion on its rail lines caused by bad weather, amid rising oil shipments and a bumper grain harvest. He also said he was “embarrassed” by taking too long to exit a $2.3 billion investment in Tesco Plc, a British retailer that became mired in an accounting scandal. Berkshire lost $444 million on Tesco, but Buffett said that’s just 0.2 percent of its net worth. Berkshire owns more than 80 companies, such as Geico insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream, and $117.5 billion of equity investments in such companies as Wells Fargo & Co , Coca-Cola Co, American Express Co and IBM Corp. Buffett remains on the prowl for acquisitions, and with $63.27 billion of cash could make big purchases, which he calls “elephants,” while preserving a $20 billion cash cushion. Despite spending $7.8 billion on 31 acquisitions in 2014, Berkshire has not bought an elephant since paying $12.25 billion to buy half of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co in 2013. And while Buffett has said he may shop more in Germany, after on Feb. 20 agreeing to buy a German motorcycle accessories retailer, Berkshire’s main focus will remain at home. “Though we will always invest abroad as well, the mother lode of opportunities runs through America,” he wrote. Buffett’s letter retained the folksy tone that have helped make him popular among investors. Talking about his See’s Candies business, which requires little capital investment, Buffett compared the company’s profits to “rabbits breeding.” And Buffett said that at Berkshire’s annual meeting last year, part of a weekend he calls “Woodstock for Capitalists,” shareholders bought 10,000 bottles of Heinz ketchup with Buffett or Munger on the labels. (Buffett’s cost $2, Munger’s $1.50.) This year, Buffett said Heinz will also be selling mustard as well as ketchup. “Buy both!” he exhorted.

1110,WFC,Special Report: How Wall Street captured Washington's effort to rein in banks,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Keith Higgins was certain: Banks weren’t to blame. Higgins, a top attorney at prominent law firm Ropes & Gray LLP, was chairman of an American Bar Association committee on securities regulation. As such, he lobbied strenuously against a rule U.S. regulators were drafting that would require banks to disclose a lot more about asset-backed securities like those that had just torpedoed the economy. In letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Higgins argued that divulging more details about the mortgages and other financial products that go into such securities would only confuse investors. And it was investors, with “insufficient understanding and … commitment” to their investments, who had been the real cause of the crisis, he argued in a July 2008 letter. Then, in May 2013, as the SEC was still hashing out the rule, Higgins was tapped to lead the very 500-person SEC division that was writing it. When the final version of Reg AB II came out last year, disclosure rules advocated by many within the agency had been stripped out. Of particular concern: Banks could continue to sell asset-backed securities to institutional investors on the private market with no new disclosure requirements. Reg AB II was one of many rules Congress ordered up in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act to fill regulatory holes in the market for asset-backed securities. An unprecedented expansion of this multitrillion-dollar market, in which banks repackage mortgages and other assets into complex securities and sell them to investors, lay at the heart of the financial crisis. But as the evolution of Reg AB II suggests, banks and their advocates have managed to preserve many of the industry’s pre-crisis practices by focusing lobbying efforts on obscure corners of the regulatory world, far from the glare of congressional debate or public scrutiny. Many of these agencies are staffed by appointees from the industry they regulate and return to it when their stints are over. “The banks have done an end run around all the disclosure efforts,” said Thomas Adams, a securitization lawyer at Paykin Krieg & Adams LLP. Four of the six lawyers now in the leadership of the American Bar Association committee that Higgins chaired have worked for the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance. And between 1993 and 2006, the proportion of financial services veterans on the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) went from zero to 25 percent, according to a 2012 Harvard Business School study. Higgins declined to comment. SEC Chief of Staff Lona Nallengara said the selection of Higgins to run the division was a reflection of his status as “a respected securities practitioner with 30 years’ experience.” Nallengara, who was acting director of the Division of Corporation Finance for seven months before Higgins took over, said the decision to remove disclosure requirements for private offerings from Reg AB II was made before Higgins arrived. “Keith had no influence on that decision,” he said. Like the SEC when it was weighing rules on asset-backed securities, FASB, the private group that sets accounting standards for public companies, came under political pressure to tighten rules blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis. Critics said FASB had made it too easy for banks to stash mountains of securitized loans in off-balance-sheet vehicles based in the Cayman Islands, hiding their exposure to risks that eventually swamped them and the global economy. Here, too, banks pushed back hard. And here, too, their protests reached sympathetic ears. Ultimately, FASB’s rules barely dented the size of banks’ off-book holdings. The practical effect of these lobbying efforts has been obvious. Thanks to the private-market loophole in the SEC’s Reg AB II, banks are selling a greater share of securitized debt than ever on private markets – largely off the radar of regulators and watchdogs. Residential mortgage-backed securities tendered on the private market jumped to 78 percent of all new offerings last year from 46 percent in 2013 and just 10 percent in 2007, according to data obtained by Thomson Reuters. The privately sold share for commercial mortgage-backed securities jumped to 83 percent from 37 percent in 2013. The markets for asset-backed securities today are a fraction of what they were in the run-up to the crisis. But they are showing strong signs of revival. What bothers some current and former regulators and industry watchers is that much of the regulatory framework that enabled the crisis remains in place. “What’s playing out is exactly what we were worried about,” said Sheila Bair, former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. “Most everything is going into these private markets where regulations require little visibility of what’s happening.” With their access to off-balance-sheet entities largely preserved, the banks continue to hold vast sums of securitized loans offshore and off their books. Together, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley hold nearly $3.3 trillion of securitized loans in off-balance-sheet entities. “I still think there is significantly more risk there than is being reflected on banks’ balance sheets,” Bair said. It isn’t just the banks. As hedge funds and private equity funds have ramped up high-risk lending in recent years, their use of off-balance-sheet vehicles has ballooned. For example, KKR & Co LP’s reported exposure to loss from off-balance-sheet entities has risen tenfold since 2010. A KKR spokesperson said less than half of the firm’s off-balance-sheet entities are composed of corporate loans originated by KKR and securitized into collateralized loan obligations, but declined to provide numbers or other information. Robert W. Stewart, a spokesman for the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF), the private-sector body that oversees FASB, said the new rules “resulted in a dramatic increase” of the holdings financial firms and companies in other industries keep on their books. “These standards eliminated long-standing exceptions for securitizations, and that reduced the opportunity for work-arounds,” he said. Even before the crisis, FASB struggled for years with how banks should account for off-balance-sheet entities and the assets held in them. Every additional dollar in assets on a bank’s balance sheet requires holding more idle cash in capital reserves to cover those assets if they drop in value. The increase in reserves means less revenue and earning power and smaller employee bonuses. Off-balance-sheet vehicles free banks to make more loans and build assets without having to add to capital reserves. These assets include all sorts of things: Treasury securities, home and commercial real estate mortgages, auto loans, even “junk” loans used to finance leveraged buyouts. Banks bundle the assets into securities, sell the securities to investors, and then park the assets in separately incorporated off-balance-sheet vehicles. In theory, if one of these vehicles fails because the underlying assets sour – as, for example, when large numbers of homeowners default on their mortgages – the bank does not have to bail it out. In practice, they often do – to preserve their reputations in a lucrative market, and because specific asset-backed securities often carry implicit or explicit guarantees that leave banks legally liable to make investors whole. “Repeatedly, constantly, when the new off-balance-sheet entity got into financial difficulty, the bank bailed out the entity that they supposedly didn’t have any more connection with,” said Halsey Bullen, who was with FASB from 1983 to 2006, much of that time managing financial instruments projects. FASB sought to address the issue several times before the crisis – to no avail. It tightened rules on Special Purpose Entities, the off-balance-sheet vehicles that played a big role in the collapse of Enron Corp in 2001. But banks simply started using alternatives called Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs). Again, in 2005, as banks were stuffing huge amounts of securitized subprime mortgages into QSPEs, FASB Chairman Robert Herz began to push for change. Earlier in his career, Herz turned down a shot to be U.S. chief executive officer of accounting giant PriceWaterhouse Coopers, where he was a partner, rather than give up his campaign to remake accounting standards. Now, he wanted to toughen the rules and require banks to put more loans back on their balance sheets. “Clearly there were lots of things that had been given off-balance-sheet treatment that should not have been designated as such,” said Herz. “All the big Wall Street firms were doing it.” Herz was opposed, former FASB officials said, by former JP Morgan Vice President Leslie Seidman – a FASB member known to some of her critics as “Loophole Leslie” for her advocacy of bank-friendly accounting rules. Herz’s effort fizzled out. “I started to realize that some people on the board didn’t want to get anywhere,” said Don Young, a FASB board member at the time. Seidman said she objected to the initial proposals because they would have made the rules more complex and created more exceptions. Then, in 2008, the U.S. housing bubble burst, and with it, the market for mortgage-backed securities. Citigroup announced that it was on the hook for more than $100 billion in loans it had placed in off-balance-sheet vehicles. All told, the biggest U.S. banks wound up bringing back onto their books more than $300 billion of guarantees for off-balance-sheet loans and bonds, according to a report by RiskMetrics Group Inc. The banks paid out billions more in lawsuits to investors demanding that they take responsibility for off-balance-sheet loans. Under pressure from Congress, FASB again took up the issue. Banks bombarded the board with comment letters and tasked full-time staff to sway it as it started drafting new rules. Force banks to report too much lending on their balance sheets, Citigroup, Bank of America and other banks argued, and credit available to ordinary Americans would shrink. Make them disclose too much information about what was going off-balance-sheet, and it would just confuse investors. In September 2008, Young, the FASB member, told a congressional hearing: “There was unending lobbying of the FASB” to preserve banks’ right to continue stashing loans off their balance sheets. Even so, FASB’s draft rules did away with QSPEs. That left something known as a Variable Interest Entity, which carried a tougher standard banks had to meet to secure off-balance-sheet treatment. But then, as the lobbying continued, FASB relaxed the rules for VIEs, essentially closing one loophole while opening another. “The changes were all in the direction of watering it down,” said Marcus Stanley, director of Americans for Financial Reform, a consumer group in Washington, D.C. There are concrete measures of the banks’ lobbying success. When FASB published the first draft of the rules in 2008, Citigroup warned in its annual report that it expected to increase its risk-weighted assets by $100 billion as a result of having to bring loans onto its books. A year later, after FASB issued its final draft of the new rules, Citigroup brought just $24 billion in risk-weighted assets back onto its books. At the time, it had $557.5 billion in off-balance-sheet loans. The new rules took effect on Jan. 1, 2010. The top six U.S. banks brought about $400 billion of loans back onto their books, a 2010 Deloitte Study found, a fraction of the $4 trillion of loans – mostly mortgages – those banks then held off their balance sheets. That August, Herz walked out of a FASB meeting and resigned. He said at the time that he wanted to spend more time with his family. Several people close to him said FAF, the overseer of FASB, forced out Herz amid growing backlash against his tough stances on some accounting rules important to banks. Stewart, the FAF spokesman, declined to comment on the circumstances surrounding Herz’s departure. The six-person committee overseeing the selection process for Herz’s successor included a former chief investment officer of Swiss bank UBS AG; the managing partner of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co, one of the largest private banks in the U.S.; a former American Express vice president; and a lawyer from Brown & Associates, a law firm that caters to financial industry clients. They chose Seidman, the first former bank executive – rather than auditor – to hold the top spot. Bank stocks rose on the news. Seidman’s term at FASB ended in 2013. She is now a director at ratings company Moody’s Corp and on the board of governors of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Wall Street’s self-regulatory group. A few months after FASB published the final version of its new accounting rules, the SEC released a draft of Reg AB II. The rule represented regulators’ effort to address a big factor in the financial crisis: lack of information about the mortgages, leveraged loans and other securitized assets that banks had been stuffing into off-balance-sheet entities. Among other things, Dodd-Frank ordered the SEC to “adopt regulations … requiring each issuer of an asset-backed security to disclose, for each tranche or class of security, information regarding the assets backing that security.” An early draft of the rule would have required, for example, that a seller of mortgage-backed securities provide “loan tape” to regulators and investors. That’s an industry term for a breakdown of all the mortgages in a security, including each borrower’s credit history, the loan-to-value ratio of each mortgage, and other measures of risk. The first draft of the rule applied the stricter requirements to securities sold on both the public and the private markets. SEC rules have long distinguished between investments meant for ordinary mom-and-pop investors and those for wealthy, sophisticated institutional investors. The mass-market investments are registered with the SEC and require extensive disclosure before they can be offered to the public. The private investments typically aren’t registered with the SEC, carry scant disclosure requirements and are sold to “accredited investors” considered savvy enough to know what they are buying. That distinction fell apart during the financial crisis, when it became clear that supposedly sophisticated investors were holding vast stores of toxic mortgage-backed securities. “The disaster was way worse in unregistered private markets during the crisis,” said a senior industry regulator. “Not addressing that market did not seem to be addressing the crisis.” SEC staff overwhelmingly supported the rule, according to people inside the agency. So, too, did two important SEC constituencies: investors, who believed the rule would make it easier to assess the quality of the securities, and ratings agencies, whose failure to accurately rate such securities landed them in hot water in 2008. The banks, however, opposed the early draft. In dozens of comment letters to the SEC, they argued that the additional disclosures would saddle them with an unnecessary and costly burden that would cripple the securitization industry and in turn dry up credit for millions of Americans. Banks were helped by a particularly vocal and effective advocate: the American Bar Association. The ABA’s Committee on the Federal Regulation of Securities – that’s the committee with four former SEC employees – wrote 94 comment letters to the SEC and other regulators after the crisis, making it one of the most prolific commenters on SEC rules. Nearly all of the comments parroted letters from banks and financial industry lobbyists. Higgins, chair of the committee when the SEC started drafting Reg AB II, personally signed 46 of the letters. He also was one of Ropes & Gray’s top securities lawyers, advising clients such as Hasbro Inc and Reebok International Ltd. Time and again, he argued that investors had only themselves to blame for their losses in the financial crisis. “These problems have been compounded in the structured finance markets not by insufficient information, but by insufficient understanding of the information that is already available to investors,” he wrote in one letter. “Rather than needing more information, these investors need both the commitment and the tools to analyze and distill the information that is already available.” The ABA’s lobbying carried particular weight with the SEC because of the banks’ growing reliance on the courts to fight reforms they opposed. In the year that followed 2010 passage of Dodd-Frank, the SEC churned out an average of 5.5 new rule proposals a month, one of the fastest rule-making clips in SEC history. Rules governing swaps, whistleblowers, and reporting of executive compensation were among dozens of proposals the agency issued. Then, on July 22, 2011, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., struck down an unrelated SEC rule mandated by Dodd-Frank that would have made it easier for shareholders to replace company directors. The court said SEC staff hadn’t done a sufficient cost-benefit analysis of the new rule. The ruling, which was sharply critical of the SEC’s rule-making process, “intimidated the agency,” said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America and a member of the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee.  SEC rule-making ground to a halt. Since the court decision, the SEC has published less than one new draft rule a month. In May 2013, one month after Mary Jo White was sworn in as SEC chairwoman, she tapped Higgins to be director of the agency’s Division of Corporation Finance, in charge of writing the rule he had lobbied against. Some inside the SEC were shocked. Higgins was close to White’s husband, John White, a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP who had himself chaired the SEC division when Higgins was head of the ABA committee, according to people who know both men. John White and Mary Jo White declined to comment. On August 27 last year, 52 months after the original draft proposal of Reg AB II was floated, the SEC adopted the final version. The 683-page rule detailed a raft of new disclosure requirements for asset-backed securities – but only for those registered with the SEC for general offer to the public. For the same securities sold on the private market, disclosure requirements remained scant. SEC Chair White said the new rules would ensure that investors “have full information, the tools and the time to understand potential investments and the nature and extent of associated risks.” In the end, 2014 saw a bigger share than ever of asset-backed securities being sold on private markets, with little disclosure or regulatory oversight.

1111,WFC,SPECIAL REPORT-How Wall Street captured Washington's effort to rein in banks,"(For more Reuters Special Reports, double-click on ) By Charles Levinson NEW YORK, April 9 (Reuters) - In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Keith Higgins was certain: Banks weren’t to blame. Higgins, a top attorney at prominent law firm Ropes & Gray LLP, was chairman of an American Bar Association committee on securities regulation. As such, he lobbied strenuously against a rule U.S. regulators were drafting that would require banks to disclose a lot more about asset-backed securities like those that had just torpedoed the economy. In letters to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Higgins argued that divulging more details about the mortgages and other financial products that go into such securities would only confuse investors. And it was investors, with “insufficient understanding and  commitment” to their investments, who had been the real cause of the crisis, he argued in a July 2008 letter. Then, in May 2013, as the SEC was still hashing out the rule, Higgins was tapped to lead the very 500-person SEC division that was writing it. When the final version of Reg AB II came out last year, disclosure rules advocated by many within the agency had been stripped out. Of particular concern: Banks could continue to sell asset-backed securities to institutional investors on the private market with no new disclosure requirements. Reg AB II was one of many rules Congress ordered up in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act to fill regulatory holes in the market for asset-backed securities. An unprecedented expansion of this multitrillion-dollar market, in which banks repackage mortgages and other assets into complex securities and sell them to investors, lay at the heart of the financial crisis. But as the evolution of Reg AB II suggests, banks and their advocates have managed to preserve many of the industry’s pre-crisis practices by focusing lobbying efforts on obscure corners of the regulatory world, far from the glare of congressional debate or public scrutiny. Many of these agencies are staffed by appointees from the industry they regulate and return to it when their stints are over. “The banks have done an end run around all the disclosure efforts,” said Thomas Adams, a securitization lawyer at Paykin Krieg & Adams LLP. Four of the six lawyers now in the leadership of the American Bar Association committee that Higgins chaired have worked for the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance. And between 1993 and 2006, the proportion of financial services veterans on the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) went from zero to 25 percent, according to a 2012 Harvard Business School study. Higgins declined to comment. SEC Chief of Staff Lona Nallengara said the selection of Higgins to run the division was a reflection of his status as “a respected securities practitioner with 30 years’ experience.” Nallengara, who was acting director of the Division of Corporation Finance for seven months before Higgins took over, said the decision to remove disclosure requirements for private offerings from Reg AB II was made before Higgins arrived. “Keith had no influence on that decision,” he said. Like the SEC when it was weighing rules on asset-backed securities, FASB, the private group that sets accounting standards for public companies, came under political pressure to tighten rules blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis. Critics said FASB had made it too easy for banks to stash mountains of securitized loans in off-balance-sheet vehicles based in the Cayman Islands, hiding their exposure to risks that eventually swamped them and the global economy. Here, too, banks pushed back hard. And here, too, their protests reached sympathetic ears. Ultimately, FASB’s rules barely dented the size of banks’ off-book holdings. The practical effect of these lobbying efforts has been obvious. Thanks to the private-market loophole in the SEC’s Reg AB II, banks are selling a greater share of securitized debt than ever on private markets - largely off the radar of regulators and watchdogs. Residential mortgage-backed securities tendered on the private market jumped to 78 percent of all new offerings last year from 46 percent in 2013 and just 10 percent in 2007, according to data obtained by Thomson Reuters. The privately sold share for commercial mortgage-backed securities jumped to 83 percent from 37 percent in 2013. The markets for asset-backed securities today are a fraction of what they were in the run-up to the crisis. But they are showing strong signs of revival. What bothers some current and former regulators and industry watchers is that much of the regulatory framework that enabled the crisis remains in place. “What’s playing out is exactly what we were worried about,” said Sheila Bair, former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. “Most everything is going into these private markets where regulations require little visibility of what’s happening.” With their access to off-balance-sheet entities largely preserved, the banks continue to hold vast sums of securitized loans offshore and off their books. Together, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup, Wells Fargo & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley hold nearly $3.3 trillion of securitized loans in off-balance-sheet entities. “I still think there is significantly more risk there than is being reflected on banks’ balance sheets,” Bair said. It isn’t just the banks. As hedge funds and private equity funds have ramped up high-risk lending in recent years, their use of off-balance-sheet vehicles has ballooned. For example, KKR & Co LP’s reported exposure to loss from off-balance-sheet entities has risen tenfold since 2010. A KKR spokesperson said less than half of the firm’s off-balance-sheet entities are composed of corporate loans originated by KKR and securitized into collateralized loan obligations, but declined to provide numbers or other information. Robert W. Stewart, a spokesman for the Financial Accounting Foundation (FAF), the private-sector body that oversees FASB, said the new rules “resulted in a dramatic increase” of the holdings financial firms and companies in other industries keep on their books. “These standards eliminated long-standing exceptions for securitizations, and that reduced the opportunity for work-arounds,” he said. Even before the crisis, FASB struggled for years with how banks should account for off-balance-sheet entities and the assets held in them. Every additional dollar in assets on a bank’s balance sheet requires holding more idle cash in capital reserves to cover those assets if they drop in value. The increase in reserves means less revenue and earning power and smaller employee bonuses. Off-balance-sheet vehicles free banks to make more loans and build assets without having to add to capital reserves. These assets include all sorts of things: Treasury securities, home and commercial real estate mortgages, auto loans, even “junk” loans used to finance leveraged buyouts. Banks bundle the assets into securities, sell the securities to investors, and then park the assets in separately incorporated off-balance-sheet vehicles. In theory, if one of these vehicles fails because the underlying assets sour - as, for example, when large numbers of homeowners default on their mortgages - the bank does not have to bail it out. In practice, they often do - to preserve their reputations in a lucrative market, and because specific asset-backed securities often carry implicit or explicit guarantees that leave banks legally liable to make investors whole. “Repeatedly, constantly, when the new off-balance-sheet entity got into financial difficulty, the bank bailed out the entity that they supposedly didn’t have any more connection with,” said Halsey Bullen, who was with FASB from 1983 to 2006, much of that time managing financial instruments projects. FASB sought to address the issue several times before the crisis - to no avail. It tightened rules on Special Purpose Entities, the off-balance-sheet vehicles that played a big role in the collapse of Enron Corp in 2001. But banks simply started using alternatives called Qualifying Special Purpose Entities (QSPEs). Again, in 2005, as banks were stuffing huge amounts of securitized subprime mortgages into QSPEs, FASB Chairman Robert Herz began to push for change. Earlier in his career, Herz turned down a shot to be U.S. chief executive officer of accounting giant PriceWaterhouse Coopers, where he was a partner, rather than give up his campaign to remake accounting standards. Now, he wanted to toughen the rules and require banks to put more loans back on their balance sheets. “Clearly there were lots of things that had been given off-balance-sheet treatment that should not have been designated as such,” said Herz. “All the big Wall Street firms were doing it.” Herz was opposed, former FASB officials said, by former JP Morgan Vice President Leslie Seidman - a FASB member known to some of her critics as “Loophole Leslie” for her advocacy of bank-friendly accounting rules. Herz’s effort fizzled out. “I started to realize that some people on the board didn’t want to get anywhere,” said Don Young, a FASB board member at the time. Seidman said she objected to the initial proposals because they would have made the rules more complex and created more exceptions. Then, in 2008, the U.S. housing bubble burst, and with it, the market for mortgage-backed securities. Citigroup announced that it was on the hook for more than $100 billion in loans it had placed in off-balance-sheet vehicles. All told, the biggest U.S. banks wound up bringing back onto their books more than $300 billion of guarantees for off-balance-sheet loans and bonds, according to a report by RiskMetrics Group Inc. The banks paid out billions more in lawsuits to investors demanding that they take responsibility for off-balance-sheet loans. Under pressure from Congress, FASB again took up the issue. Banks bombarded the board with comment letters and tasked full-time staff to sway it as it started drafting new rules. Force banks to report too much lending on their balance sheets, Citigroup, Bank of America and other banks argued, and credit available to ordinary Americans would shrink. Make them disclose too much information about what was going off-balance-sheet, and it would just confuse investors. In September 2008, Young, the FASB member, told a congressional hearing: “There was unending lobbying of the FASB” to preserve banks’ right to continue stashing loans off their balance sheets. Even so, FASB’s draft rules did away with QSPEs. That left something known as a Variable Interest Entity, which carried a tougher standard banks had to meet to secure off-balance-sheet treatment. But then, as the lobbying continued, FASB relaxed the rules for VIEs, essentially closing one loophole while opening another. “The changes were all in the direction of watering it down,” said Marcus Stanley, director of Americans for Financial Reform, a consumer group in Washington, D.C. There are concrete measures of the banks’ lobbying success. When FASB published the first draft of the rules in 2008, Citigroup warned in its annual report that it expected to increase its risk-weighted assets by $100 billion as a result of having to bring loans onto its books. A year later, after FASB issued its final draft of the new rules, Citigroup brought just $24 billion in risk-weighted assets back onto its books. At the time, it had $557.5 billion in off-balance-sheet loans. The new rules took effect on Jan. 1, 2010. The top six U.S. banks brought about $400 billion of loans back onto their books, a 2010 Deloitte Study found, a fraction of the $4 trillion of loans - mostly mortgages - those banks then held off their balance sheets.

1116,WFC,Wells Fargo profit falls as employee costs rise,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the largest U.S. mortgage lender, reported a drop in quarterly profit for the first time in five years as employee costs rose at a time margins are under pressure from low interest rates.  Banks are struggling to boost margins as persistent low interest rates and stricter capital requirements offset any benefit from cost-saving initiatives. Low rates have prevented Wells Fargo and its regional rivals from capitalizing on their growing deposit base. Net interest income has also come under pressure as lower-yielding loans replace higher-yielding assets.  Wells Fargo’s shares fell 2 percent to $53.58 on Tuesday. The bank’s net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, fell to 2.95 percent in the first quarter ended March 31 from 3.20 percent a year earlier.  Non-interest expense rose about 5 percent to $12.51 billion, mainly because of higher employee costs as the bank expanded its workforce and paid incentives to retirement-eligible employees. Wells Fargo’s employee base rose to 266,000 in the quarter, S&P; Capital IQ analyst Erik Oja said. The bank had 265,000 employees at the end of 2014.  “But we aren’t standing still (on costs),” Chief Executive John Stumpf said. “We watch every expense around here as we repurpose dollars we save into things we have to invest in.” The bank, however, reported a better-than-expected profit as mortgage banking revenue rose after four quarters of decline, helped by a surge in refinancing. The average 30-year mortgage rate fell to as low as 3.59 percent in the first quarter, the lowest in nearly two years, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Rates in the year-earlier quarter averaged 4.35 percent on a monthly basis. Wells Fargo’s revenue from mortgage lending rose 2.4 percent to $1.55 billion. The bank said on Friday it was buying commercial real estate loans valued at $9 billion from GE Capital. Mortgage applications in the pipeline surged to $44 billion as of March 31 from $26 billion at December-end. JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), which also reported results on Tuesday, said quarterly net income from mortgage banking rose nearly three-fold. Net income applicable to Wells Fargo’s common shareholders fell about 2.7 percent to $5.46 billion, or $1.04 per share.    Revenue rose 3 percent to $21.28 billion.  Analysts on average had expected earnings of 98 cents per share and revenue of $21.24 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1117,WFC,"Wells Fargo's Wealth profit driven by loans, managed accounts","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo Corp showed again in the first quarter why it and other big banks want their financial advisers to sell fee-based products. Profit in the “Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement” sector of the San Francisco-based bank rose 18 percent from the previous year’s first quarter to a record $561 million, more than double the sector’s 8 percent revenue growth to $3.7 billion, Wells Fargo said on Tuesday. Like other bank-owned brokerage firms, Wells encourages its financial advisers to sell “managed accounts,” where a fee is charged for allocating client money among mutual funds, investment managers and other sources. Managed account assets at the Wells Fargo Advisors brokerage business grew 12 percent, or $46 billion, to $435 billion in the three months ending March 31. In the year-earlier quarter such assets were up 13 percent. Banks promote fee-based accounts because they provide more profitable and consistent revenue than traditional commission accounts that ebb and flow with market sentiment.  Wells’ wealth management results bode well for other large bank-owned brokerages such as Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley that are reporting quarterly results later this week. Although Wells’ brokerage force fell by 53 advisers from a year earlier, to 15,134, it prospered in another area dear to bank-owned brokerages, cross-marketing loans to traditional brokerage clients.  Average loan balances rose 13.9 percent in the first quarter to $56.9 billion, as brokers and private bankers sold clients’ jumbo mortgages and loans collateralized by securities portfolios, Wells said. The lending surge escalated the sector’s net interest income by 12.1 percent to $861 million.  In another sign of cross-marketing success, wealth sector clients used 10.44 Wells Fargo products or services per household as of the end of February, the most of Wells’ three businesses. In 2014, Wells’ bank branches referred more than $1 billion of business a month to the wealth unit, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsbury said in a conference call. Expenses in the wealth sector rose 4 percent to $2.83 billion, the highest in at least five quarters, reflecting costs for increased trading volume. The wealth sector remains Wells’ smallest business.

1119,WFC,Wells Fargo cautious on sales quotas amid banker complaints: CFO,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co takes seriously allegations that some of its bankers push products customers don’t need due to pressure to meet aggressive sales quotas, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on Tuesday. “We have to be cautious and make sure we’re not creating incentives for people to sell products and provide services that are not in the best interest of the customer,” Shrewsberry said in an interview. “We take that deadly seriously, and we have for a long time.” Wells Fargo is known in the banking industry for being particularly good at selling its customers multiple products, a strategy referred to as “cross-selling”. But in recent years, the bank has faced accusations by some employees, and at least one customer who filed a lawsuit, that its bankers inappropriately open accounts under customers’ names to meet sales quotas. A group of Wells Fargo employees planned to protest the quotas outside one of the bank’s corporate offices in Minneapolis this week, according to The Guardian. An employee told the newspaper that the quota had recently dropped to 15 products a day from 20 products a day. Wells Fargo looks into allegations of inappropriate cross-selling pressure and wants to set up the right incentives for workers, Shrewsberry said. While sales quotas are part of a “scorecard” for bankers in Wells Fargo branches, it is not the only measurement used to evaluate performance, he added. Last quarter, the cross-sell ratio in Wells Fargo’s retail bank was 6.13 products per household, down from 6.17 in the same period a year earlier. The figure declined because the bank took in more new customers who have only one product, a checking account, for instance, Shrewsberry said. The company also divested a student-loan business that would have boosted the number of products per household. “We’ve got a big product array and we’re trying to make that available to customers,” he said. “We’re not bashful about trying to provide them with everything they do need.” ",4142015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-far-crosssell/wells-fargo-cautious-on-sales-quotas-amid-banker-complaints-cfo-idUSKBN0N51X720150414

Banks are struggling to boost margins as persistent low interest rates and stricter capital requirements offset any benefit from cost-saving initiatives. Low rates have prevented Wells Fargo and its regional rivals from capitalizing on their growing deposit base.

The bank’s net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, fell to 2.95 percent in the first quarter ended March 31 from 3.20 percent a year earlier.

JPMorgan Chase & Co posted stronger-than-expected earnings growth, helped by a rebound in fixed-income trading. Revenue rose 5 percent. The stock rose 1 percent to $62.67 before the bell. Wells Fargo & Co dipped 0.8 percent to $54.15 despite also reporting first-quarter earnings that topped expectations. Johnson & Johnson adjusted earnings topped expectations, but the consumer products giant also cut tits full-year forecast, citing the impact of a strong dollar.  The stock - which, along with JPMorgan, is a Dow component - rose 0.4 percent to $100.99. First-quarter profits for S&P; 500 companies are seen falling 2.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. On Jan. 1, analysts were looking for growth of 5.3 percent. The drop in expectations could mean that companies can more easily top a lowered bar, but the trend of the season remains unclear with fewer than 10 percent of the S&P; having reported. This week will see a number of major companies report, including Intel Corp  after the market closes on Tuesday. Late Monday, Norfolk Southern Corp forecast a surprise drop in its first-quarter earnings and revenue, sending shares down 5.5 percent to $99.10 in premarket. Nokia Oyj is in talks to buy Alcatel-Lucent SA , a deal that would combine the telecommunications industry’s two weakest players but could pose challenges in cutting costs and overcoming political opposition. U.S. shares of Nokia fell 3.6 percent to $8.00 in heavy premarket trading while Alcatel rose 6.9 percent to $4.65.

1129,WFC,U.S. judge finds Wells Fargo breached 2010 mortgage settlement,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo Bank breached a nationwide 2010 legal settlement involving adjustable-payment mortgages, a federal judge ruled, finding that the bank did not properly evaluate homeowners who applied for help to avoid foreclosures. In an order on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Seeborg in northern California told Wells to meet with plaintiffs and find a way to remedy its violations, including steps to let some homeowners reapply for loan assistance. Tom Goyda, spokesman for Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said the bank is reviewing the decision and will be working to provide additional information requested. “We’re quite pleased,” said Jeffrey Berns, lead counsel for homeowners. “I don’t know whether this is going to prevent foreclosures but it is certainly going to open (Wells) up to claims for damages from class members.” The decision is the latest twist in a long-running dispute over the settlement, which resolved complaints about “pick-a-payment loans.” Wells inherited a large portfolio of these loans with its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia Corp. The loans gave borrowers the option to initially pay less than the interest due, but the escalating payments that came later contributed to waves of home foreclosures in the 2007-2009 housing crisis, which threw the country into recession. Plaintiffs’ lawyers for years have argued that Wells was not complying with its agreement to grant loan modifications potentially worth up to $2.7 billion to homeowners who took out the loans. The modifications were an important piece of the settlement, which also called for Wells to pay $50 million to class members. In court filings, plaintiffs’ lawyers said Wells was not using proper methods to determine whether homeowners were at imminent risk of default and thus qualified for assistance under the settlement. The lawyers said thousands of homeowners were denied mortgage assistance because Wells used the wrong methods to gauge their financial hardships. In Wednesday’s ruling, Seeborg chided both sides, saying they “seem to have almost no idea what, exactly, they agreed to more than four years ago.” He concurred with plaintiffs that Wells breached the agreement by using “evolving and perhaps ill-defined standards” in weighing applications for loan modifications.

1132,WFC,U.S. judge says Wells Fargo insider trading case may fall short,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An administrative judge hearing an insider trading case against a former Wells Fargo & Co managing director cautioned on Monday that U.S. regulators may have fallen short of tough new requirements for proving insider trading. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Law Judge Jason Patil delivered the warning to SEC lawyers after hearing arguments in a civil proceeding against Joseph Ruggieri. Ruggieri, who traded healthcare stocks for Wells Fargo, is accused by the SEC of unlawfully trading on tips about imminent upgrades and downgrades in the ratings of various companies he covered. Since a federal appeals court ruling in December, SEC lawyers and prosecutors face the additional burden of proving that traders knew that the source of inside information received a personal benefit in exchange for sharing non-public information. “With this case, the personal benefit element is a close question,” Patil said. “It is an extremely close question.” Ruggieri is accused of having made only about $117,000 in profits for Wells Fargo by trading on tips from April 2010 through March 2011. But his trial has garnered a disproportionate amount of attention because it began soon after the December ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That ruling has been viewed by securities lawyers as a setback for efforts to curb insider trading on Wall Street because it raised the bar for the SEC and prosecutors in proving the wrongful use of confidential or non-public information. The appeals court also narrowed what constitutes a benefit, saying it must be of “some consequence” and something more than just a gesture of friendship. The SEC says Ruggieri received tips from Gregory Bolan, a former Wells Fargo research analyst who has reached a settlement with the SEC. Terms of the settlement have not yet been disclosed. SEC lawyer Alex Vasilescu said in his closing argument that Bolan’s friendship with Ruggieri, and need for positive job feedback from him as a mentor who could advance his career,  were enough to meet the 2nd Circuit ruling. Paul Ryan, Ruggieri’s lawyer, dismissed the argument as “preposterous.”  “The SEC’s case is a purely circumstantial one,” Ryan said in his closing argument. “This is the mother of all circumstantial cases.”  Patil said he would rule in the non-jury case by July 29. Possible civil penalties for insider trading include a fine, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and a bar from the industry. The case is In the Matter of Bolan and Ruggieri, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Administrative Proceeding No. 3-16178.

The discussions with Wells Fargo started just last week and other parties may also hold talks with GE about buying the entire U.S. CLL portfolio, the source said. GE is also exploring selling the U.S. CLL portfolio piecemeal and could decide to break the business up, the source added. The source asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential. GE and Wells Fargo declined to comment.  The talks with Wells Fargo underscore GE’s urgency in looking to dismantle its GE Capital business and free itself from the financial regulatory pressures that come with it. GE earlier this month unveiled plans to exit the bulk of GE Capital over the next few years to focus more on industrial manufacturing. Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein told analysts on the company’s quarterly conference call last week that GE was seeing “incredible” interest in the GE Capital assets. Some $165 billion of assets have been earmarked for sale. In another sign of the speed with which GE is moving on the plan, it announced earlier this month that it had agreed to sell most of the real estate assets of GE Capital to Blackstone Group LP and Wells Fargo for $23 billion. That deal took less than four weeks to negotiate.  GE’s CLL business offers secured commercial loans and equipment financing to primarily midsized companies.

1158,WFC,Appeal planned after U.S. judge tosses $55 million verdict vs Wells Fargo,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A class of homeowners suing Wells Fargo & Co over excessive fees plans to appeal a judge’s ruling tossing a $54.8 million verdict against the bank, their lawyer said on Tuesday. U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in a little-noticed decision on May 29 decertified the class of homeowners, whose mortgages were owned or serviced by the now-defunct Money Store and HomEq Servicing. The lawsuit, filed by homeowner Joseph Mazzei in 2001, alleged the companies improperly overcharged borrowers by assessing late fees even after their mortgages went into default. The homeowners had sought to recoup about $629 million for alleged overcharges and interest, according to an October court filing.  Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, never owned Money Store or HomEq but nonetheless found itself facing liability thanks to its 2008 acquisition of Wachovia, HomEq’s onetime owner. A federal jury in December returned a mixed verdict in the long-running case against The Money Store and HomEq, which was established to service The Money Store’s loans following the closure of its origination business. But in the May 29 decision, Koeltl said the plaintiffs had failed to establish the Money Store defendants had contractual obligations with those homeowners whose loans were only serviced, but not originated, by the companies. While Koeltl said decertifying the class of homeowners post-trial was a drastic step, upholding the verdict “would be a manifest injustice.” The judge also rejected the plaintiffs’ request for a new trial on a separate claim, which jurors had rejected, over whether the companies mishandled attorney fees. “We believe the jury’s verdict should stand and we will be appealing,” the plaintiffs lawyer, Moshe Horn, said. Daniel Pollack, a lawyer for Wells Fargo, on Tuesday referred requests for comment to his client, which did not immediately respond. Wachovia, which Wells Fargo acquired during the financial crisis, had owned HomEq until 2006, when it sold it to Barclays Plc, which in 2010 sold it to Ocwen Financial Corp. The Money Store was owned by First Union, which later became part of Wachovia. First Union shut down The Money Store in 2000 because of losses. A New Jersey mortgage lender bought the Money Store’s name in 2006 and has continued using it. The case is Mazzei v.

Units of Wells Fargo & Co, Raymond James Financial Inc and LPL Financial Holdings Inc “failed to adequately supervise” the sale of mutual funds that offered sales charge waivers, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said in a statement. The firms, in settling the cases with FINRA, neither admitted nor denied the industry-funded regulator’s allegations, FINRA said. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment. Raymond James and LPL said in statements that they self-reported the problem to FINRA, which did not impose fines, given the firms’ “extraordinary cooperation.” The overcharges involve Class A shares, which have lower fees than Class B and C shares, but require an initial sales charge. Many mutual funds, however, waive the upfront sales for certain types of retirement accounts and charities. Wells Fargo, Raymond James, and LPL had offered these waivers and disclosed them in their prospectuses, FINRA said. The case is similar to one FINRA brought last year against Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit, which resulted in the firm paying an $8 million fine. FINRA’s Merrill case prompted some firms to review their practices to see whether they also had failed to provide the sales charge discounts that mutual fund issuers had made available to retirement accounts and charities, said Bradley Bennett, FINRA’s enforcement chief, in a June interview.

Wells Fargo, Raymond James and LPL will pay affected customers an estimated $15 million, $8.7 million and $6.3 million, respectively.

Portions of GE’s $74 billion Commercial Loans and Leases portfolio that are up for sale now “fit nicely with the businesses at Wells Fargo,” CFO John Shrewsberry said in an interview following the bank’s second quarter earnings report Tuesday. Shrewsberry also singled out GE’s railcar leasing business, saying it might complement Wells Fargo’s railcar leasing division, First Union Rail. “There’s a possibility that some portion of that makes sense for Wells Fargo,” he said.  The bank’s interest in GE Capital’s commercial loan and leases has been reported by Reuters and other media outlets, but Tuesday was the first time that bank executives confirmed their involvement on the record. Even if the bank does not win these assets, it may finance the winners’ purchases, he added. Wells Fargo bought $9 billion of commercial real estate loans from GE Capital in the second quarter, and provided $4 billion of financing to Blackstone, which also bought a portfolio of the loans.  Other GE assets that have not yet been put formally on the block may also be of interest, Shrewsberry said. He declined to name other specific assets. In April, GE announced the sale of some $200 billion in GE Capital assets as it moves away from finance and focuses on its industrial businesses. In a call with analysts on Tuesday, Shrewsberry said Wells Fargo might slow down on returning capital to shareholders through moves like share buybacks if it saw the right opportunity to buy good assets.

1171,WFC,Wells Fargo profit drops for second straight quarter as costs rise,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, reported a drop in profit for the second straight quarter as employee costs and other expenses rose at a time when it is struggling with slow revenue growth. Lower interest rates have crimped the bank’s net income for the past two quarters, ending its five-year run of rising profits that was driven by a mortgage refinancing boom.  Although Wells Fargo and other major U.S. banks have been making more loans, their net interest income growth has been sluggish due to low lending rates. Banks’ net interest income has been under pressure also as lower-yielding loans replace higher-yielding assets. Wells Fargo’s net interest income rose 4 percent in the second quarter ended June 30, a massive drop from the 97.5 percent growth it reported for the first quarter of 2009. The bank expects the acquisition of a $9 billion commercial loan portfolio from General Electric Co to add to its interest income in the current quarter, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on a conference call on Tuesday. Net interest margin, the difference between the rates at which the bank borrows and lends, fell to 2.97 percent from 3.15 percent a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose 2.3 percent to $12.47 billion, accounting for about 58.5 percent of revenue, the higher end of its targeted range of 55-59 percent. Mortgage banking revenue, which accounted for 17 percent of its non-interest income, fell 1 percent. “Mortgage banking was a little weaker than I had thought ... that was a little bit of a disappointment,” Sandler O’Neill analyst R. Scott Siefers said. Wells Fargo made $62 billion of home loans in the quarter, up from $47 billion a year earlier and $49 billion in the first quarter. However, the bank expects to make lower mortgage loans in the third quarter as refinancing activity slows ahead of an expected rate hike by the Federal Reserve.  JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a stronger-than-expected rise in quarterly profit earlier on Tuesday as legal and restructuring expenses declined. Net income applicable to Wells Fargo’s common shareholders fell to $5.36 billion from $5.42 billion. Total revenue rose about 1 percent to $21.30 billion. Wells Fargo’s shares were up about 1 percent at $57.16 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is trading at 1.5 times its book value, while shares of other major banks are trading at 0.7-1.1 times.

1177,WFC,Wells Fargo wins dismissal of predatory lending lawsuits,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) won the dismissal of two lawsuits on Friday that had accused the largest U.S. mortgage lender of violating the federal Fair Housing Act by engaging in predatory lending practices in Los Angeles and Chicago. The lawsuits by the city of Los Angeles and by Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago, accused Wells Fargo of steering black and Hispanic borrowers into higher-cost loans, a process sometimes called “reverse redlining”. They said this resulted in higher foreclosures and lower property tax collections, and necessitated higher spending to combat urban blight. Los Angeles and Chicago are the second- and third-most populous U.S. cities. “We are pleased with both decisions,” Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said. The San Francisco-based lender is also the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets. Several large U.S. cities and counties such as Baltimore, Cleveland, Memphis and Miami have accused banks of biased mortgage lending that prolonged the nation’s housing crisis. Their lawsuits have had mixed success. In the Los Angeles case, the city accused Wells Fargo of discriminatory lending dating to 2004. U.S. District Judge Otis Wright, however, found no showing of FHA violations within the two-year statute of limitations period prior to the December 2013 lawsuit. Wright also faulted Los Angeles’s litigation strategy. He said the city failed to identify any Wells Fargo policy to steer minorities into costly loans, and instead the city objected to the bank’s issuance of federally-insured loans that can help lower-income borrowers afford homes, despite their higher costs. “In the name of advocating on behalf of minority borrowers, the city decided to fight for an outcome that would hurt those same borrowers,” Wright wrote. “That decision is disheartening.” Meanwhile, in the Chicago case, U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman said Congress did not authorize entities such as Cook County to pursue an FHA claim to begin with. The county “alleges neither that it was denied a loan nor offered unfavorable terms - setting aside the obvious point that Cook County is not alleged to have a race or other protected trait,” Feinerman wrote. He said his decision did not mean that Wells Fargo complied with the FHA, or that “direct victims” of alleged abusive lending did not deserve compensation. The office of Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wright’s decision.

1181,WFC,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo wins dismissal of Chicago predatory lending lawsuit,"(Adds details from decision, comments, case citation, byline) By Jonathan Stempel July 17 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co on Friday won the dismissal of a lawsuit by Cook County, Illinois that accused the largest U.S. mortgage lender of violating the federal Fair Housing Act by engaging in predatory lending practices in the Chicago area. U.S. District Judge Gary Feinerman in Chicago said dismissal was appropriate because Cook County was outside the FHA’s “zone of interests,” meaning that Congress did not authorize the county to bring claims under that law. Cook County, which includes Chicago, accused Wells Fargo of targeting tens of thousands of black, Hispanic and female borrowers through “equity stripping,” where it imposed excessive or unnecessary rates and fees as well as refinancing penalties. The county said this alleged misconduct boosted foreclosures, eroded property taxes, necessitated higher spending to combat blight, and caused at least $300 million of damages. Steering minorities into costly loans is sometimes called “reverse redlining.” Chicago is the third most populous U.S. city. Feinerman said Cook County had constitutional standing to sue Wells Fargo, but could not pursue an FHA claim because it “alleges neither that it was denied a loan nor offered unfavorable terms - setting aside the obvious point that Cook County is not alleged to have a race or other protected trait.” The judge added that his decision did not mean or suggest that Wells Fargo did not violate the FHA or engage in reverse redlining, “or that the direct victims of Wells Fargo’s alleged misconduct do not deserve compensation.” Feinerman said Cook County may file an amended complaint, but that he “doubts” that the problem can be fixed. Cook County and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said: “We are pleased with the court’s decision and thoughtful analysis.” The San Francisco-based lender is also the fourth-largest U.S. bank by assets. The lawsuit is similar to others that Cook County brought against Bank of America Corp and Britain’s HSBC Holdings Plc. Several large U.S. cities and counties have accused major banks in lawsuits of biased mortgage lending that prolonged the nation’s housing crisis. These lawsuits have had mixed success.

1184,WFC,Ex-Wells Fargo compliance officer spared penalty in U.S. SEC case,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Wells Fargo & Co compliance officer accused of altering a document sought by U.S. securities regulators for an insider trading investigation won the dismissal of her case Wednesday after a judge ruled against sanctioning her. Judy Wolf, the compliance officer, was found by an U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission administrative law judge to have willfully aided and abetted and caused securities law violations by Wells Fargo. But SEC Administrative Law Judge Cameron Elliot, who presided over a trial before the agency’s in-house court, ruled that sanctioning Wolf would create the “misperception” in the industry that she alone was responsible for the violation. He noted that Wells Fargo in September 2014 agreed to pay $5 million and admit wrongdoing to resolve charges it did not have adequate controls in place to prevent an employee from insider trading. “Wells Fargo clearly had much deeper and more systemic problems than one bad apple,” Elliot wrote. A spokeswoman for the SEC declined comment. A lawyer for Wolf did not respond to a request for comment, nor did a spokesman for Wells Fargo. According to the SEC, in 2010, Wolf, then at Wells Fargo Advisors LLC, closed an internal review of a Brazil-based broker’s trading in Burger King with no findings. The broker, Waldyr Da Silva Prado Neto, was subsequently charged in criminal and civil proceedings with trading illegally in Burger King securities before the $3.26 billion buyout of the fast-food chain by private equity firm 3G Capital Partners. After the SEC charged Prado in 2012, Wolf changed a document to make it appear as if she had performed a more thorough review, the agency said. The SEC said its staff spotted the alteration after Wells Fargo provided the document as part of the commission’s investigation. Wolf initially denied changing it, but later testified she had done so, the SEC said. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged Prado and Igor Cornelsen, a banker and fellow Brazilian, in January 2014, saying the men made respective profits of $1.68 million and $175,000 trading ahead of the deal’s announcement. Neither Prado nor Cornelsen have appeared in U.S. court to face the criminal charges.  Cornelson agreed in 2012 to pay $5.1 million to settle earlier SEC charges.

1187,WFC,"UPDATE 3-Berkshire profit falls 37 pct on investment, insurance slump","(Adds details on investments, paragraph 18; adds second byline) By Jonathan Stempel and Jennifer Ablan Aug 7 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc   said on Friday its second-quarter profit fell 37 percent, reflecting a significant decline in investment gains and an underwriting loss from insurance operations, which include Geico. Net income for the Omaha, Nebraska-based insurance and investment company fell to $4.01 billion, or $2,442 per Class A share, from $6.4 billion, or $3,889 per share, a year earlier. Operating profit dropped well below analysts’ forecasts, declining 10 percent to $3.89 billion, or $2,367 per share, from $4.33 billion, or $2,634 per share, despite improvements at the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy units. Analysts on average expected operating profit of about $3,038 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 3 percent to $51.37 billion. Book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, rose 2 percent from the end of March to $149,735. Net investment and derivative gains plummeted 94 percent to $123 million from $2.06 billion a year earlier, when Berkshire shed its 40-year stake in former Washington Post publisher Graham Holdings Co. The most recent quarter included losses on contracts betting on long-term gains in major stock market indexes. Accounting rules require Berkshire to report investment and derivative gains and losses with earnings. Buffett considers the amounts in any given quarter irrelevant, and not reflective of Berkshire’s business performance. Earnings from insurance, Berkshire’s best-known operating sector, fell 39 percent to $939 million, and included a $38 million underwriting loss versus a year-earlier $411 million profit. Much of that weakness stemmed from the Geico car insurance unit. Its pretax underwriting gain fell 87 percent to $53 million, as it paid out more of the premiums it collected to cover losses from accidents. Berkshire is boosting premium rates as a result. Meanwhile, a Berkshire business that insures against major catastrophes suffered a $411 million pretax underwriting loss, reflecting currency fluctuations and a storm loss in Australia. Berkshire has been paring back in some insurance areas, particularly reinsurance, as new investors enter the industry, reducing the premiums that Berkshire can charge. “Everyone is chasing the business,” said Jeff Matthews, a principal at the hedge fund Ram Partners. “Outside of insurance,” he added, “things look fine.” Profit from BNSF rose 5 percent to $963 million as improved operating performance offset lower demand to ship petroleum products, reflecting lower crude oil prices, and fertilizer. Berkshire Hathaway Energy, a utility mostly owned by Berkshire, saw profit rise 34 percent to $502 million, helped by higher retail rates and a lower income tax rate. Berkshire has more than 80 operating businesses in such sectors as insurance, energy, food, industrial products and railroads. As of June 30 it also owned $117.7 billion of stocks such as Wells Fargo & Co and Coca-Cola Co. It bought $3.09 billion of equities in the quarter, without identifying the companies. The company estimated it will take a $7 billion non-cash pretax gain in the third quarter related to its 26.9 percent stake in Kraft Heinz Co. Berkshire took that stake in early July after backing the purchase of Kraft Foods Group Inc by H.J. Heinz Co, which Berkshire and Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital acquired in 2013. The stake is worth about $25.5 billion, more than double what Buffett has said was Berkshire’s $9.5 billion investment. Berkshire has the ability to make more big acquisitions, having ended the quarter with $66.59 billion of cash. The company also has dozens of smaller businesses that sell, among other things, Benjamin Moore paint, Borsheim’s jewelry, Dairy Queen ice cream, Fruit of the Loom underwear, Johns Manville insulation and See’s candies. On Friday, Berkshire Class A shares closed down $187.24 at $215,462.76, and its Class B shares rose 20 cents to $143.55. The shares are about 6 percent below their record highs set on Dec. 8.

1188,WFC,Exclusive: Wells Fargo explores sale of crop insurance business,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) may divest its crop insurance business, one of the biggest in the United States, a spokeswoman told Reuters on Tuesday, as regulatory restrictions on U.S. banks force some to reconsider underwriting insurance policies. Wells Fargo has launched an auction for the business that could fetch more than $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said. When contacted by Reuters, Wells Fargo said it is reviewing strategic options for its Rural Community Insurance Services (RCIS) subsidiary that may include a sale, excluding the Wells Fargo Insurance Crop Agency, its brokerage arm. “Wells Fargo regularly evaluates the strengths and strategic fit for each of its businesses. As our model continues to evolve, we are more focused on increasing cross-sell and growing the distribution side of the insurance business,” a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said in a statement. Bidders for RCIS could include reinsurers seeking exposure to the primary insurance market such as Bermuda-based PartnerRe Ltd PRE.N or Axis Capital Holdings Ltd (AXS.N), the sources said. Muenchener Rueckversicherungs Gesellschaft in Muenchen AG (MUVGn.DE) or Allianz SE (ALVG.DE) are also potential buyers, the sources said. Axis and PartnerRe declined to comment, MunichRe and Allianz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Crop insurance helps farmers protect themselves from financial ruin when drought, disease, freezing temperatures, hail, or wind destroy their crops. About 90 percent of planted farmland is covered by insurance every year. A combination of low interest rates and extreme weather  such as flooding and drought have combined to make the business unattractive to many financial institutions and companies of late. OneBeacon Insurance Group Ltd OB.N and Monsanto Co (MON.N) are among those to have sold their crop insurance arms in recent months. Banks have been under increased pressure from U.S. regulators to strengthen their balance sheet and take on less risk, and this has also weighed on their ability to participate in the insurance business. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), for example, sold its Global Atlantic Financial Group Ltd insurance unit in 2013. Wells Fargo now plans to be active in crop insurance through its insurance brokerage arm.   RCIS collects more than $2 billion in premiums annually from farmers. It has more than 4,000 licensed agents who can insure 137 types of crops.

The 58-year-old will be succeeded by Franklin Codel on October 1. Codel, 50, is currently head of mortgage production. Heid oversees one of Wells Fargo’s biggest businesses, responsible for nearly 8 percent of the bank’s 2014 revenue. Wells Fargo’s share of the mortgage market fell to 13 percent in the first quarter from 16 percent in 2014 and 30 percent in 2012. Lenders that are not banks, like Quicken Financial Inc, have been grabbing market share. Heid has helped lead the business for the past 11 years and was its overall chief for the past four. He reports to Avid Modjtabai, senior executive vice president and head of Wells Fargo’s Consumer Lending Group. Heid is a member of a 13-person Operating Committee at Wells Fargo, along with CEO John Stumpf, CFO John Shrewsberry, and other administrative and business unit heads. Codel will also report to Modjtabai, but a spokeswoman said he will not replace Heid on the operating committee.

1192,WFC,"UPDATE 1-Fidelity Contrafund bullish on banks, singles out Wells Fargo","(New throughout, adds more details about Contrafund’s stance on bank stocks) By Tim McLaughlin BOSTON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Fidelity Contrafund manager Will Danoff, who oversees $113 billion in assets, said Wells Fargo & Co’s profits “could benefit materially” from a rise in interest U.S. rates, and that he believed the stock market was underestimating the Federal Reserve’s changing stance on rates. Contrafund is one of Wells Fargo’s largest investors, holding nearly $4 billion worth of the stock at the end of June, or 3.6 percent of the fund’s assets. Danoff has been increasing his position in bank stocks over the past year. “I believe the group offers an excellent risk-reward trade-off, particularly given the Fed’s change in interest-rate policy,” Danoff said in an interview Boston-based Fidelity Investments made available on Wednesday. “I believe the market is underestimating the importance of the Fed’s change in its interest-rate stance,” Danoff said. “If interest rates strengthen, I believe Wells Fargo’s earnings could benefit materially and the stock could perform very well.” Danoff also expressed more optimism for Internet stocks and caution about the commodities sector. His remarks are closely followed on Wall Street, where he is considered one of the mutual fund industry’s best stock pickers. Contrafund has produced an annualized total return of 7.51 percent over the past 15 years, or 3.16 percentage points better than the S&P; 500 Index, according to Morningstar Inc. Danoff noted how falling interest rates have squeezed profit margins of U.S. banks have been squeezed over the past decade. The margin at Wells Fargo, a longtime holding for Contrafund, fell to 3.10 percent from 4.85 percent between 2004 and 2014, Danoff said. “With the most recent data putting the unemployment rate at 5.3 percent, the U.S. economy does not need the stimulus of abnormally low rates,” Danoff continued. “If rates rise, price-to-earnings ratios may contract and the overall market may suffer modestly. But I believe certain sectors of the market could benefit from rising rates, most notably banks.

1194,WFC,"Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway hints at new purchase, ups Charter stake","(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  on Friday said it boosted its stake in cable TV operator Charter Communications Corp, and signaled it may have another large investment planned after agreeing to buy Precision Castparts Corp in its largest-ever purchase. Berkshire also appeared to have shed its stakes in oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc and refiner Phillips 66 in the second quarter, as the oil industry struggles with falling prices. The changes were disclosed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing detailing Berkshire’s $107.2 billion U.S. stock portfolio on June 30. Berkshire kept some details about its holdings confidential. The SEC sometimes lets the Omaha, Nebraska-based company delay disclosures of new stakes so Buffett can build them quietly, rather than have investors piggyback on him before he finishes. Friday’s filing suggests that only a small percentage of the $3.09 billion of stock that Berkshire bought in the quarter went to companies it already owned. Berkshire held 8.51 million shares of Charter worth $1.46 billion on June 30, up from 5.98 million shares on March 31. It also confirmed its purchase of 20 million shares, or 8.7 percent, of paint maker Axalta Coating Systems Ltd from controlling shareholder Carlyle Group LP. Berkshire reported lower stakes in conglomerate Chicago Bridge & Iron Co, media company Viacom Inc and Wabco Holdings Inc, which sells braking and suspension systems for commercial vehicles. It swapped most of what was once a much larger Phillips 66 stake for a chemicals business in February 2014. Friday’s filing did not disclose who made which Berkshire investments. Smaller investments are often made by Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who may eventually succeed Buffett as chief investment officers. Combs invested in Precision Castparts before Berkshire said on Monday it would buy the aerospace parts maker. The transaction valued that company at $32.3 billion.

1196,WFC,Wells Fargo adding car loan branches to boost less risky lending,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo (WFC.N) is building more branches devoted to car loans and financing for auto dealers in an effort to increase its auto lending business without taking bad credit risk, the bank’s head of car lending told Reuters. Making smart credit decisions is critical now as the auto lending business heats up. U.S. consumers have $1 trillion of automobile loans outstanding, up from about $700 billion in the first quarter of 2010, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve. That represents much steeper growth than credit card loans, which have remained essentially flat. The fourth-largest U.S. bank has 56 branches for car and dealer financing, including one it recently opened in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, said Dawn Martin Harp, head of dealer services. The branches, called “regional business centers” serve car dealers exclusively. The bank is planning to add more offices, including one in the Southwest by the end of the year, but has no specific number that it is targeting, Martin Harp said.  The branches are not just sales offices. They include credit officers who approve or deny loans. Having credit officers who are in the regions where they are lending ensures that they know their customers better, Martin Harp said. “It’s a differentiator for us,” she said. She added that the pace of growth depends on opportunities in different communities and in the overall car loan market. With the market’s growth in recent years, regulators and bankers have grown concerned about risk in the sector. Wells Fargo’s Chief Executive John Shrewsberry said on the bank’s first-quarter earnings call in April that auto lending has “gotten to be a more competitive market,” adding, “we’ve picked our spots, I think, a little bit more delicately.”  On the second-quarter call in July, he said the sector is nonetheless “providing a big opportunity because so many cars are being sold.” The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the major U.S. banking regulators, said in a report earlier this year that it is closely watching auto lending, noting that “extended rapid growth is difficult to maintain and can sometimes mask early signs of weakening credit quality.”  Wells is taking a different tack from competitors including Ally Financial Inc (ALLY.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), which have centralized their auto lending operations to cut costs.     ",8182015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-far-auto/wells-fargo-adding-car-loan-branches-to-boost-less-risky-lending-idUSKCN0QN1ZK20150818

1204,WFC,"Miami mortgage lawsuits vs BofA, Citigroup, Wells Fargo are revived","(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday revived three lawsuits in which the City of Miami accused Wells Fargo & Co, Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc of predatory mortgage lending to black and Hispanic borrowers. By a 3-0 vote, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a lower court erred in dismissing the city’s claims under the federal Fair Housing Act, over what Miami called a decade of lending discrimination in its residential housing market. “It is clear that the harm the city claims to have suffered has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute prohibits,” Circuit Judge Stanley Marcus wrote. U.S. cities including Baltimore, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Memphis have with mixed success accused banks of biased mortgage lending that prolonged the nation’s housing crisis. Miami alleged that Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup steered non-white borrowers into higher-cost loans they often could not afford, even if they had good credit. The city said this “reverse redlining” led to a large number of foreclosures, lower property tax collections and increased spending to combat urban blight. In July 2014, U.S. District Judge William Dimitrouleas in Fort Lauderdale, Florida dismissed Miami’s lawsuits. He said the city lacked standing to sue, and that the alleged harm was too remote from the banks’ conduct. But the appeals court said that standard was too stringent and that banks could have reasonably foreseen the “attendant harm” from their alleged discriminatory lending. The 11th Circuit did not rule on the merits. Wells Fargo is the largest U.S. mortgage lender and includes the former Wachovia, while Bank of America includes the former Countrywide Financial. Tom Goyda, a Wells Fargo spokesman, said the San Francisco-based bank is disappointed in the outcome and “prepared to present strong arguments in support of our long history of fair and responsible lending in Miami and across the country.” Bank of America spokesman Rick Simon said the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank is considering its options. “Our record demonstrates a firm commitment and strong record for fair and responsible lending and community revitalization,” he said. Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for New York-based Citigroup, declined to comment. The Miami city attorney’s office had no immediate comment. In July, federal judges in Chicago and Los Angeles dismissed lawsuit accusing Wells Fargo of predatory lending in those cities. Los Angeles’ similar lawsuit against Bank of America was dismissed in May. The cases in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals are Miami v. Bank of America Corp et al, No. 14-14543; Miami v.

1207,WFC,Ex-Wells Fargo trader beats SEC insider trading charges,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Wells Fargo & Co trader on Monday was cleared of insider trading charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after a major appellate decision limited authorities’ ability to pursue such cases. Following a trial before the regulator’s in-house court, Administrative Law Judge Jason Patil dismissed the charges against Joseph Ruggieri, who the SEC said made over $117,000 for Wells Fargo trading on tips by one of the bank’s analysts. Patil said while the SEC established that Ruggieri traded on the tips four times, it failed to prove the analyst, Gregory Bolan, received anything in exchange for the information as required by the December appellate ruling. Paul Ryan, Ruggieri’s lawyer, said the “decision makes clear what we have said from the beginning: Joseph Ruggieri did not commit insider trading.” The SEC declined to comment. The SEC alleged that Ruggieri, a healthcare stock trader at Wells Fargo in New York, in 2010 and 2011 traded on tips about six ratings changes made by Bolan for companies that included Athenahealth Inc and Bruker Corp. The SEC brought charges in September 2014. Bolan agreed to settle for $75,000 while neither admitting nor denying the charges. Ruggieri, who denied the charges, became the first defendant to face trial after a Dec. 10 ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that authorities say narrowed what constitutes insider trading. The 2nd Circuit, in reversing the convictions of hedge fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, held that authorities must prove a trader knew a tip’s source received something in exchange. The court also narrowly defined what constituted a benefit to the tipper, saying it had to be of “some consequence” and could not be just be a friendship. In his decision on Monday, Patil cited the 2nd Circuit’s ruling in concluding that the SEC failed to prove Bolan received anything in exchange for his tips. The SEC contended that Bolan tipped Ruggieri in exchange for positive feedback that could factor into bonus and promotion decisions and in order to maintain their friendship. But Patil said it was “more plausible that Ruggieri’s feedback was genuine” and that Bolan did not seek it as an illicit benefit. Their friendship “was not a meaningful, close, or personal one,” Patil said. The SEC can appeal. The U.S. Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to review the 2nd Circuit’s decision. The case is In the Matter of Bolan and Ruggieri, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Administrative Proceeding No. 3-16178.

The complaint is a sign that U.S. municipalities are not relenting in a push to hold big banks liable for economic damages following the 2007 foreclosure crisis. Similar lawsuits accusing banks of mortgage discrimination have been dismissed, though a federal appeals court in Florida recently gave three major cases new life by affirming cities’ right to sue under the U.S. Fair Housing Act (FHA). Filed on Monday in a Northern California federal court, the complaint against Wells seeks punitive damages for alleged FHA violations, accusing the bank of “putting its financial interests ahead of its customers and the City of Oakland in order to maximize profits.” Wells Fargo spokesman Tom Goyda said the accusations “do not reflect how we operate in the communities where we do business.” The bank will vigorously defend its record as a fair and responsible lender, he said. Oakland’s lawsuit accuses Wells of targeting minorities for high-cost loans even if they qualified for more affordable loans. The lawsuit said many of the loans ended in foreclosure because Wells refused to refinance them on the same terms it granted to white borrowers.  The lawsuit also accuses Wells of violating the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, which bars discrimination in housing practices on the basis of race. The lawsuit said Wells steered minorities into various types of “predatory loans,” including those with high interest rates, balloon payments and large prepayment penalties. African-American borrowers in Oakland were 2.4 times more likely to receive a predatory loan than comparable white borrowers, the lawsuit said. Hispanic borrowers were 2.5 times more likely to receive a predatory loan, the lawsuit said. Loans in minority neighborhoods were 4.75 times more likely to end in foreclosure, the lawsuit said. The disproportionate number of foreclosures among minorities would not have happened if the bank applied uniform lending practices, the lawsuit said.  A similar lawsuit filed by the City of Los Angeles was dismissed in July by U.S. District Judge Otis Wright, who said Wells issued only 27 high-cost loans to minorities during the period covered by the lawsuit, and no evidence was offered that any of them resulted in foreclosure.

1216,WFC,Fitch Affirms Wells Fargo & Company's LT IDR at 'AA-' Following Large Regional Bank Review,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Wells Fargo & Company's  (WFC) ratings at 'AA-/F1+' and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.'s ratings at 'AA/F1+'. The  Rating Outlook remains Stable. The affirmation reflects the company's superior  earnings profile, solid and consistent management team, and strength of its  franchise across many business lines.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T; Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T; Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects the company's superior earnings profile, solid and  consistent management team, and strength of its franchise across many business  lines.  Over the past several years, WFC's financial performance has been very strong  despite a challenging economic and interest rate environment. WFC continues to  post solid levels of net income, with return on assets (ROAs) well in excess of  the large regional average. WFC's superior earnings performance is a core  strength for the company, and a positive rating driver that differentiates it  from its peers. Fitch attributes WFC's superior earnings profile to its proven cross-sell  strategy, low funding costs, efficient cost structure, and a diversified  business model by geography and product type that has proven resilient over  time. Further, Fitch assumes that WFC has been able to benefit post-financial  crisis from a flight to quality.  WFC continues to report very strong levels of net income, in spite of  considerable margin compression over the past couple of years, more so than  other large regional peers. Somewhat explaining this, WFC has reported the  highest level of deposit growth, which has left the company with an excess  amount of liquidity, only to be reinvested into lower yielding assets. This  excess cash represents a significant resource available for the company to  invest into earning assets as rates rise.  Fitch views WFC's deposit franchise as currently undervalued in this low-rate  environment. As deposit rates have fallen from pre-crisis levels, the benefit to  WFC from its low cost of funding has compressed. The differential in funding  costs has narrowed as all the large regional banks have all been able to  continually lower deposit costs. When interest rates rise, WFC will likely be  able to maintain lower funding costs relative to peers, helping to maintain  superior profitability metrics in a higher interest rate environment.  WFC's management team is also viewed very favorably by Fitch. There has been a  great deal of stability in the executive management ranks, with little turnover.  Fitch views this as a competitive strength as the company's strategic direction  and corporate culture remains consistent, and less vulnerable to swings in  strategy. WFC's stated strategic objectives are clearly articulated, and  achievable. Even during a challenging interest rate environment, the company is  able to easily meet its three financial targets for ROA, return on equity (ROE)  and the efficiency ratio, which are 1.3% to 1.6%, 12% to 15%, and 55% to 59%,  respectively.  Fitch views no company as immune to operational issues or losses, though WFC has  emerged relatively unscathed from the financial crisis, especially relative to  similarly sized peers. Fitch attributes WFC's greater immunity to risk  management failures and lack of outsized legal charges that have plagued the  bigger banks to its long-tenured senior management team and strong corporate  risk culture.  WFC's franchise is considered the strongest of the large regional banks, with  leading market shares in many sectors and asset classes. WFC has the second most  deposits in the U.S., and is a leading lender in many products, including  mortgage origination and servicing, small business, commercial real estate,  automobile, and middle-market commercial & industrial (C&I;). WFC is also the  second largest debit card issuer, second largest private student lender, third  largest full-service retail brokerage (based on financial advisors), and fourth  largest wealth management provider (based on AUM). This franchise provides the  company with economies of scale that are difficult to replicate, and allows the  company to effectively compete with any bank given the breadth of its product  offerings.  In terms of WFC's financial profile, asset quality continues to improve, while  capital and liquidity remain good. WFC's credit risk metrics have improved  alongside the industry. WFC's nonperforming asset (NPA) ratios remain elevated  and above regional bank peer averages. Much of the weaker relative performance  is due to a large balance of mortgage-related accruing troubled debt  restructurings (TDRs). Despite higher NPA levels, NCOs are roughly in line with  peer averages. Fitch expects loan losses will increase from currently  unsustainably low levels for WFC, as well as the industry, especially under a  higher interest rate environment. However, higher provisioning should not  materially impact WFC's financial profile given its earnings strength.  Although WFC is one of the largest participants in the energy-sector, overall  O&G; loans represent less than 2% of total loans. WFC indicated that its loan  loss reserves incorporate potential losses on WFC's oil and gas exposures.  WFC's capital profile is considered solid, relative to its risk profile, capital  generation capabilities, and target payout ranges. The Common Equity Tier 1  under Basel III Advanced Approach, fully phased-in, was 10.55% at June 30, 2015,  well above the fully phased-in requirement of 9%, which includes the recently  announced 2% G-SIB capital surcharge.  Fitch expects that WFC will maintain a capital cushion over the 9% requirement  to insulate the company from volatility in unrealized losses and the valuation  of the MSR asset. There is also uncertainty with regard to the inclusion of the  capital surcharge in CCAR stress testing. As such, Fitch believes that WFC will  likely carry a higher level of capital than some of its large regional peers  over the long term, who do not have a G-SIB surcharge.   In terms of the finalized U.S. Basel III supplemental leverage ratio (SLR) rule  issued on April 8, 2014, WFC easily meets the holding company requirement with  an estimated fully phased-in SLR of 7.8% at June 30, 2015. Fitch expects that  WFC will be able to meet a long-term debt requirement when the regulatory rules  are announced; however, the requirement to maintain a higher level of debt than  its business model needs may modestly impact profitability and could lead to  incremental risk taking.  WFC is primarily deposit funded, with core deposits representing 75% of total  funding sources as of June 30, 2015. WFC also actively uses wholesale funding  sources, including short- and long-term debt. Debt maturities are well  distributed, and significant liquidity is held in the form of cash and liquid  assets at both the parent company and the banks. Furthermore, there is a limited  reliance on short-term borrowings, with federal funds purchased, securities sold  under agreements to repurchase, commercial paper, trading liabilities, and other  short-term borrowings, at approximately 9% of total funding as of June 30, 2015,  well below similarly-sized banks, though higher than the large regional peer  average.  The parent's liquidity is considered solid, as the firm strives to maintain its  parent liquidity position such that it has the ability to stay out of the  wholesale markets for a minimum of 12 months at any given point in time. WFC's  high credit ratings have helped it gain universal acceptance in virtually all  global capital markets on very favorable terms, and Fitch anticipates that WFC  will continue to be able to easily issue debt to meet upcoming debt maturities  and other requirements.   SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES WFC's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'aa-' for loss  severity. WFC's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while WFC's trust  preferred securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two  times for non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria  and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk  profiles and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank  Northwest are rated one notch higher than Wells Fargo Bank's IDR and senior  unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor  preference.  U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior  recovery prospects in the event of default.  WFC's international subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank International's deposit ratings  are at the same level as senior debt ratings because their preferential status  is less clear and disclosure concerning dually payable deposits makes it  difficult to determine if they are eligible for U.S. depositor preference. HOLDING COMPANY  WFC's VR is equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. VRs are also equalized  reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and subsidiary  failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY Fitch upgraded the IDRs of Wells Fargo Bank N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank Northwest  N.A. to 'AA' in May 2015, The Rating Outlooks are Stable. The upgrade of the  banks' ratings to a notch above the parent reflects the expected implementation  of total loss absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S. Global Systemically  Important Banks (G-SIBs) and the presence of a substantial debt buffer in the  holding company. The VRs remain equalized between WFC and its material operating subsidiaries.  The common VR of WFC and its operating companies reflects the correlated  performance, or failure rate between the WFC and these subsidiaries. Fitch takes  a group view on the credit profile from a failure perspective, while the IDR  reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk on senior debt. Fitch  believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly equivalent, while the default  risk given at the operating company would be lower given TLAC. All U.S. bank  subsidiaries carry a common VR, regardless of size, as U.S. banks are  cross-guaranteed under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and  Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  Wells Fargo Canada Corp., Wells Fargo Bank International, and Wells Fargo  Securities International Limited are wholly owned subsidiaries of WFC or Wells  Fargo Bank, N.A.  Their IDRs and debt ratings are aligned with WFC reflecting  Fitch's view that these entities are core and integral to WFC's business  strategy and operations. Their IDRs and ratings would be sensitive to the same  factors that might drive a change in WFC's IDR. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR WFC has a Support Rating (SR) of '5' and Support Rating Floor (SRF) of 'NF'. In  Fitch's view, the probability of support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not  incorporate any support.   In May of this year, Fitch downgraded the SR and SRF for Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.  and Wells Fargo Bank Northwest in line with Fitch's view of sovereign support.   The SR and SRF reflect Fitch's view that senior creditors can no longer rely on  receiving full extraordinary support from the sovereign in the event that WFC  becomes non-viable. Also, implementation of the Dodd Frank Orderly Liquidation  Authority legislation is now sufficiently progressed to provide a framework for  resolving banks that are likely to require holding company senior creditors  participating in losses, if necessary, instead of or ahead of the company  receiving sovereign support. Wells Fargo Bank International has a support rating of '1', which is an  institutional support rating, and indicates that there is a high probability  that WFC would provide support to Wells Fargo Bank International, which is  domiciled in Ireland.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT Given that WFC's ratings are already at the top of the globally rated bank  universe, Fitch views limited potential for an upgrade.  Conversely, failure to maintain earnings at above peer levels will pressure  WFC's ratings, as its earning profile is one of the key rating drivers. The  strength of the earnings stream provides for solid capital generation  capabilities, which will help absorb unexpected losses.  Market-sensitive revenues, which include gains and losses on equity investments,  trading activities, and debt securities, combined with investment banking fees,  have averaged around 6.5% of total revenues for WFC over the past year. Fitch  expects that capital markets-related revenues will remain relatively modest in  the context of overall earnings; however, an outsized reliance could impact  ratings given the general volatility and risks associated with capital markets  revenues.  WFC's ratings may also be sensitive to any outsized risks that company may take  as it relates to a higher implied cost of capital given the company's G-SIB  capital surcharge. However, given the bank has a superior earnings profile and a  strong risk culture, Fitch views this risk as low likelihood. To date, litigation-related costs have been very manageable. While WFC does not  disclose actual litigation reserves (similar to many of its peers), the high end  of the range of reasonably possible potential litigation losses in excess of the  company's liability for probable and estimable losses was $1.4 billion at June  30, 2015, considered very modest in the context of annual pretax pre-provision  revenues of roughly $35 billion. Fitch anticipates that any FHA-related fine  that may ultimately get assessed will be manageable in the context of WFC's  superior earnings profile, and that WFC will comply with the outstanding items  from the mortgage servicing amended Consent Order. However, any material  outsized legal, regulatory or operational-related charges may adversely impact  ratings.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for WFC and its operating companies' subordinated debt, trust  preferred securities, and preferred stock are sensitive to any change to WFC's  VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to WFC's  long- and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should WFC's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY   Given that WFC's and the banks' VRs remain equalized, Wells Fargo Bank N.A.'s  ratings are broadly sensitive to the same considerations that might affect WFC's  VR.  The IDRs and ratings of Wells Fargo Canada Corp., Wells Fargo Bank  International, and Wells Fargo Securities International Limited are sensitive to  the same factors that might drive a change in WFC's IDR. Wells Fargo Securities International Limited's Rating Outlook is Positive. The  Positive Outlook reflects the agency's belief that the internal TLAC of material  international operating companies will likely be large enough to meet Pillar 1  capital requirements and will then be sufficient to recapitalize them. A  one-notch upgrade is likely once Fitch has sufficient clarity on additional  disclosure on the pre-positioning of internal TLAC and its sufficiency in size  to cover a default of senior operating company liabilities. Sufficient clarity  may, however, take longer to come through than the typical Outlook horizon of  one to two years.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since WFC's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  Additionally, due to the linkage in ratings between WFC and Wells Fargo Bank  International, if Wells Fargo Bank International were to become less  strategically important to WFC, its ratings may be impacted.

1217,WFC,GE nears deal to sell over $30 bln of loans to Wells Fargo -source,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co is in advanced talks to sell a specialty finance portfolio, worth more than $30 billion, to Wells Fargo & Co, according to a person familiar with the matter, as the industrial conglomerate returns to its roots. Wells Fargo has so far outbid other parties for General Electric’s vendor financing, commercial distribution finance and direct lending assets, the person with direct knowledge of the situation said on Friday. A deal could be announced by the time Wells Fargo publishes its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, the person added, cautioning that the negotiations were ongoing and could still fall apart. The source asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. GE and Wells Fargo representatives declined to comment. The sale of the loans would leapfrog GE well past its target of shedding about $100 billion worth of finance assets by the end of this year. The company unveiled its latest divestment agreement on Monday - for its North American corporate aircraft financing portfolio - bringing its total deals to date related GE Capital to $97 billion. GE announced in April it would sell off some $200 billion in GE Capital financing assets as it focuses more on its manufacturing of industrial goods, setting off a series of transactions for the U.S. conglomerate. GE Capital’s commercial distribution finance offers lending to dealers and manufacturers of durable goods, such as boats, recreational vehicles and off-road vehicles. Direct lending  provides asset-based loans and equipment leasing to a range of mid-size and larger companies. Vendor finance allows larger networks of equipment dealers networks to offer third-party financing to buyers of equipment such as office imaging, construction, material handling and technology. GE’s overhaul attracted fresh attention earlier this week, when activist investor Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management revealed it had taken a $2.5 billion stake in the company. Wells Fargo’s CFO John Shrewsberry told Reuters in a July interview that portions of GE’s Commercial Loans and leases portfolio would “fit nicely” with Wells Fargo’s businesses. With this transaction, Wells Fargo would add more interest-bearing assets to its already large lending portfolio. Since GE has begun to sell its finance assets earlier this year, Wells Fargo has also agreed to purchase both GE’s railcar leasing business and purchased a portion of commercial real estate loans worth $9 billion.

The company unveiled its latest divestment agreement on Monday - for its North American corporate aircraft financing portfolio - bringing its total deals to date related GE Capital to $97 billion. GE announced in April it would sell off some $200 billion in GE Capital financing assets as it focuses more on its manufacturing of industrial goods, setting off a series of transactions for the U.S. conglomerate. GE Capital’s commercial distribution finance offers lending to dealers and manufacturers of durable goods, such as boats, recreational vehicles and off-road vehicles. Direct lending  provides asset-based loans and equipment leasing to a range of mid-size and larger companies. Vendor finance allows larger networks of equipment dealers networks to offer third-party financing to buyers of equipment such as office imaging, construction, material handling and technology. GE’s overhaul attracted fresh attention earlier this week, when activist investor Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management revealed it had taken a $2.5 billion stake in the company. Wells Fargo’s CFO John Shrewsberry told Reuters in a July interview that portions of GE’s Commercial Loans and leases portfolio would “fit nicely” with Wells Fargo’s businesses. With this transaction, Wells Fargo would add more interest-bearing assets to its already large lending portfolio.  Since GE has begun to sell its finance assets earlier this year, Wells Fargo has also agreed to purchase both GE’s railcar leasing business and purchased a portion of commercial real estate loans worth $9 billion.

1219,WFC,GE to sell $30 billion specialty finance business to Wells Fargo,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) took a big step on Tuesday in its plan to unload most of its financing operations, saying it has agreed to sell commercial lending and leasing businesses worth more than $30 billion to Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N). The U.S. conglomerate has now inked $126 billion in transactions — more than half of its overall target — since announcing in April it would seek to reduce its GE Capital financing business to less than 10 percent of earnings as it focuses more on industrial manufacturing. GE Capital accounted for 42 percent of the company’s profit in 2014. Only one remaining significant GE Capital business in the United States remains: its franchise finance unit, which has about $5.5 billion worth of assets.  The ability to move fast on its U.S. transactions is critical because once those deals close, GE plans to apply to  shed GE Capital’s regulatory designation as a Systemically Important Financial Institution, or SIFI, a label it gained after the 2008 financial crisis. The sale to Wells, the price of which was not disclosed,  involves three lines of business: commercial distribution finance, vendor finance and corporate finance.  Commercial distribution finance offers lending to dealers and manufacturers of durable goods, such as boats, recreational vehicles and off-road vehicles. Vendor finance involves dealer networks for commercial equipment such as copiers, materials handling and construction machines. Corporate finance includes asset-based loans and equipment leasing to a range of mid-size and larger companies. About 3,000 GE employees of the 3,500 in those businesses will shift to Wells through the deal, GE said. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016, GE said. Reuters first reported last week that GE was nearing a deal to sell the massive portfolio of loans to Wells. Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse advised GE on the deal.

1221,WFC,GE loan book helps Wells Fargo report first profit rise in three quarters,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the biggest U.S. residential mortgage lender, reported a rise in quarterly profit for the first time in three quarters on Wednesday, helped by its purchase of commercial loans from General Electric Co (GE.N). The San Francisco lender has been using its hefty balance sheet to diversify its business as it braces for a rise in interest rates to cut into demand for home loans. It is unclear when the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates, but Fed Chair Janet Yellen recently said she supports raising rates this year. Some analysts also believe the housing market is at or near a peak, while the U.S Federal Reserve has created further uncertainty by indicating it will soon raise interest rates. Wells Fargo, whose shares were down 0.5 percent in early trading, agreed earlier this year to buy a portion of GE’s commercial real estate loans worth $9 billion. That acquisition helped to drive up net interest income, a measure of the interest received from loans after paying for funding and accounting for potential loan losses, by 1.7 percent to $10.75 billion. In its latest deal, the bank said on Tuesday it would buy a portfolio of commercial loans and leases worth more than $30 billion from GE for an undisclosed amount. Nomura analysts said the deal could add 3-4 percent to earnings per share in 2016. Given that Wells Fargo is buying assets in businesses where it already has a presence, the incremental costs from these acquisitions are quite manageable, Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg wrote in a note on Tuesday. EARNINGS BEAT - JUST Wells Fargo, the No. 4 U.S. bank by assets, said its net income applicable to common shareholders rose 0.65 percent to $5.44 billion, or $1.05 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 from $5.41 billion, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier.  Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.04 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “There appeared to be no major special items, and results seem to reflect clean operating earnings,” Oppenheimer & Co analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a note. Mortgage banking revenue fell 2.7 percent to $1.59 billion, accounting for about 15 percent of non-interest income. Applications for U.S. home loans have fallen by about a quarter since mid-January, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Wells Fargo made $55 billion of home loans in the quarter, up 15 percent from a year earlier but down 11 percent from the second quarter. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the second-biggest U.S. mortgage provider, said on Tuesday its mortgage banking revenue declined 23 percent to $1.6 billion in the third quarter. Total revenue rose about 2.6 percent to $21.88 billion. Up to Tuesday’s close of $51.86, Wells Fargo’s shares had fallen 5.4 percent since the start of the year, in line with the 5.13 percent decline in the KBW index of bank stocks .BKX.

1222,WFC,Wells Fargo shifts strategy in bid to double credit card loans,"(Reuters) - George Morris, a web consultant from Boulder, Colorado, has been a Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC.N) banking customer for nearly 15 years, but when he needed a new credit card recently he picked Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N). Morris said he was put off by what he called a “rat’s nest” of offerings on Wells Fargo’s website. Consumers like Morris are a problem for Wells, which is far behind rivals in building up its credit card business. The bank said on Wednesday that it had just $32.3 billion in credit loans outstanding at the end of September, representing less than 4 percent of its total loans. At JPMorgan (JPM.N), in contrast, credit cards represented 16 percent of loans at the end of September, and at Bank of America Corp, (BAC.N) they were 10 percent.  Wells Fargo hopes to boost its business to improve its profitability - it may double the loans it has on its books in the coming years, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry told Reuters.  But to achieve its growth goals, Wells Fargo will have to be a little less like its usual self, Shrewsberry said. The fourth largest U.S. bank has long prided itself on selling more products to its customers than any of its rivals, a business practice known as “cross selling” that few lenders can do successfully. The bank’s skill in cross selling has made it one of the most profitable of the major U.S. banks, and the most valuable in terms of market valuation in the world. But cross selling won’t help Wells Fargo build up its credit card business from here, because it already has sold cards to so many of its customers: 43 percent of its 70 million customers have Wells Fargo cards. Getting much higher than that - winning customers like George Morris, for example, will not be easy. The bank instead plans to target new customers, which is risky because it knows less about them than those who, for example, have their paychecks directly deposited in their Wells Fargo checking account. Credit card loans can bring big headaches to banks because they are not usually collateralized and can head south fast when the economy slows down. Bank of America saw that first hand when it bought MBNA Corp in 2006 and ramped up its credit card portfolio by 24 percent by the end of 2008. By the end of 2009, it had to set aside more than $25 billion to cover loan losses. “We’ll take - as we have been - a very slow approach so we can get it right from a risk perspective,” Shrewsberry said. Like most banks, Wells Fargo is struggling to increase profits during a long period of low interest rates, which has reduced the profitability of lending. The bank said its lending margins fell 0.1 percentage point to 2.96 percent in the third quarter. Credit card loans can be among the most profitable consumer loans. Citigroup (C.N), for example, earns a 3 percent return on the credit card loans it makes, three times the average for the entire bank, according to estimates from Bernstein Research. As the U.S. economy recovers, defaults have been low and banks can still charge high rates for these loans. But while growing the business is not easy, Wells Fargo has been doing so. The bank on Wednesday said that in the third quarter its credit card loan book grew by 4 percent from the second quarter. If the bank can maintain that pace, the business could double in under five years. Wells has shown a willingness to test strategies that other banks have shied away from, such as offering mortgage customers the ability to apply credit card rebates to pay down home loans.  It has tried issuing American Express cards. The bank was also said to be especially aggressive in bidding on a partnership with department store chain Dillard’s Inc (DDS.N), according to an analyst. Wells eventually won the deal. The bank recognizes that the current low level of defaults will not last forever, but believes that future losses will not overwhelm profit on the loans it is making now. “We wouldn’t be pursuing it if we didn’t feel that through-the-cycle returns made sense,” Shrewsberry said.

1224,WFC,Fitch: Wells Fargo Reports Solid 3Q15 Results,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 14 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) reported $5.8 billion  in net income for a return on assets (ROA) of 1.32%, up $77 million from last  quarter. Earnings were supported by both spread income and non-interest income  growth, as well as controlled expenses. This was partially offset by an increase  in provision expenses, though at only 31 basis points (bps) of average loans,  provisioning still remains below historical averages for the company.  Fitch  Ratings views these results as in line with expectations for WFC, one of the  strongest and most consistent earnings profiles in the industry. WFC also announced an agreement to acquire GE's commercial distribution finance  and vendor finance businesses, as well as certain corporate finance loan and  leases, with assets totaling $32 billion or roughly 3.5% of WFC's total loans.  The loan and lease portfolios are predominantly U.S. and Canada-based, and the  transaction is expected to close in 1Q16.  While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Fitch views this transaction as  a complement to WFC's existing Equipment Finance and Capital Finance divisions.  WFC also recently announced acquisitions of GE's railcar and locomotive-leasing  units, and previously purchased a portfolio of CRE loans. Operating from a  position of strength, WFC has been able to benefit by taking advantage of these  opportunities, while some of its similarly sized peers have needed to de-lever  since the financial crisis.    Spread income increased almost 2% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily supported  by growth in loans and securities, as well as one additional day in the quarter.  Core loan growth was 2% on a linked-quarter basis, while securities balances  grew 1.3%. The net interest margin was fairly flat during the quarter, falling  1bp in 3Q15 to 2.96%.  Non-interest income was higher during the quarter due to growth in  market-sensitive revenues, deposit service charges, and card fees. This was  partially offset by lower mortgage banking, insurance and trust and investment  fees. Linked-quarter and prior-year comparisons also reflected a significant  increase in Other income driven by the accounting impact of lower interest rates  related to hedges on WFC's own issued debt, higher income on investments  accounted for under the equity method, and the gain on sale of the Warranty  Solutions business.  Market-sensitive revenues, which include gains and losses on equity investments,  trading activities, and debt securities, increased a substantial 25% on a  linked-quarter basis due to very strong equity gains. WFC indicated that the  gains were from a number of venture capital, private equity, and other  investments. These market-sensitive revenues, combined with investment banking  fees, were around 6% of total revenues, and can be volatile from quarter to  quarter. Mortgage banking revenues fell 7% on a sequential basis, expected given ending  application and pipeline balances at the prior quarter-end. Revenues declined as  lower origination income was only partially offset by stronger net servicing  income. Expenses were fairly flat on a sequential basis, primarily due to lower employee  benefit expenses, which were partially offset by higher salaries reflecting the  one additional day in the quarter. Operating losses remained stable, but include  still elevated litigation accruals. WFC expects to operate at the higher end of  its targeted 55% to 59% efficiency ratio for the full year 2015. The company's  efficiency ratio was 56.7% in 3Q15, improving from the prior quarter.  For the first time in over five years, WFC reported the absence of a reserve  release with provision expenses equaling net charge-offs (NCOs). WFC attributed  no reserve release to continued improvement in residential real estate, offset  by deterioration in the energy sector. Overall O&G; loans represent less than 2%  of total loans. WFC is in the process of the fall borrowing base-redetermination  process, with reserve-based loans performing as expected. WFC's exposure to  oilfield services is under more pressure, while WFC is also closely monitoring  MSAs whose economies are more closely tied to oil production.  Total loan losses ticked up 1bp to a still low 31bps during the quarter due to  seasonally higher auto losses. Non-accrual balances fell 7% on a linked-quarter  basis reflecting improvement in both consumer and commercial loan categories.  WFC continued to extend the duration of its balance sheet this quarter, albeit  at a slower pace than last quarter, as it prepares for the medium- and long-end  of the curve to remain lower for an extended period of time, irrespective of  changes on the short-end. WFC remains asset sensitive, and expects to grow  spread income over the long-term even if the rate environment remains  challenging.  The estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III,, fully phased-in, increased  roughly 12bps to 10.7% at quarter-end. WFC began using the Advanced Approach,  following regulatory approval last quarter.

The bank’s skill in cross selling has made it one of the most profitable of the major U.S. banks, and the most valuable in terms of market valuation in the world. But cross selling won’t help Wells Fargo build up its credit card business from here, because it already has sold cards to so many of its customers: 43 percent of the more than 22 million households that are Wells Fargo retail banking customers have credit cards from the bank. Getting much higher than that - winning customers like George Morris, for example, will not be easy. The bank instead plans to target new customers, which is risky because it knows less about them than those who, for example, have their paychecks directly deposited in their Wells Fargo checking account. Credit card loans can bring big headaches to banks because they are not usually collateralized and can head south fast when the economy slows down. Bank of America saw that first hand when it bought MBNA Corp in 2006 and ramped up its credit card portfolio by 24 percent by the end of 2008. By the end of 2009, it had to set aside more than $25 billion to cover loan losses. “We’ll take - as we have been - a very slow approach so we can get it right from a risk perspective,” Shrewsberry said. Like most banks, Wells Fargo is struggling to increase profits during a long period of low interest rates, which has reduced the profitability of lending. The bank said its lending margins fell 0.1 percentage point to 2.96 percent in the third quarter. Credit card loans can be among the most profitable consumer loans. Citigroup, for example, earns a 3 percent return on the credit card loans it makes, three times the average for the entire bank, according to estimates from Bernstein Research. As the U.S. economy recovers, defaults have been low and banks can still charge high rates for these loans. But while growing the business is not easy, Wells Fargo has been doing so. The bank on Wednesday said that in the third quarter its credit card loan book grew by 4 percent from the second quarter. If the bank can maintain that pace, the business could double in under five years. Wells has shown a willingness to test strategies that other banks have shied away from, such as offering mortgage customers the ability to apply credit card rebates to pay down home loans.  It has tried issuing American Express cards. The bank was also said to be especially aggressive in bidding on a partnership with department store chain Dillard’s Inc, according to an analyst. Wells eventually won the deal. The bank recognizes that the current low level of defaults will not last forever, but believes that future losses will not overwhelm profit on the loans it is making now. “We wouldn’t be pursuing it if we didn’t feel that through-the-cycle returns made sense,” Shrewsberry said.

1243,WFC,UPDATE 1-Largest U.S. banks face $120 billion shortfall under new rule,"(New throughout, specifies long term debt, mentions vote, adds comments from Fed staff and deadlines) By Dan Freed Oct 30 (Reuters) - Six big U.S. banks need to raise an additional $120 billion, most likely in long-term debt, under a rule proposed on Friday by the Federal Reserve. The requirements are aimed at ensuring that some of the biggest and most interconnected banks, which include Goldman Sachs Group Inc,, JPMorgan Chase & Co,, and Wells Fargo & Co, can better withstand another crisis by turning some of their debt, particularly debt issued by their holding companies, into equity without disrupting markets or requiring a government bailout. The banks are expected to meet the $120 billion shortfall by issuing debt, which is usually more cost-effective than issuing equity, according to Federal Reserve officials speaking at a background press briefing Friday. The rule proposed Friday, largely in line with banks’ expectations, concerns the lenders’ total loss-absorbing capacity. It is one of a series of rules aimed at reducing risk in the banking system by determining how much debt and equity banks should use to fund themselves. In a procedural vote, the Fed’s governors approved a draft of the proposal, meaning it will be submitted for public comment. During a public meeting with Fed officials, one staffer who worked on the rule said banks should have an easy time complying, because many requirements overlapped with existing rules. Further, the bulk of the debt requirements can be fulfilled by refinancing existing debt, the staffer said. Some requirements must be met by Jan. 1, 2019, while more-stringent requirements must be met by Jan. 1, 2022. The requirements are most stringent for JPMorgan, followed by Citigroup Inc. After that come Bank of America Corp,  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, all of which have the same requirement. Wells Fargo & Co’s  requirement is the next highest, followed by State Street Corp  and finally Bank of New York Mellon Corp. JPMorgan has more than $2 trillion in total assets, making it the largest U.S. bank by that measure. The officials declined to say which two banks already meet the long-term debt requirements under Friday’s proposal. The rules also apply to U.S. operations of foreign globally systemically important banks, establishing roughly parallel requirements as those for U.S. banks, Fed officials said. Also announced was a draft final rule establishing minimum margin requirements for swaps that are not cleared through an exchange. The rule is identical to one proposed by other regulators. A Wells Fargo spokesman said in a statement the bank is reviewing the proposal and it appears to be in line with expectations. Representatives from the other banks either declined comment or were not immediately available.

1249,WFC,Wells Fargo likely to issue more debt to comply with new rules,"NEW YORK, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co will likely need to issue an additional $20 billion to $40 billion of long-term debt to comply with new rules designed to help banks better weather a crisis, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on Friday. The debt issuance would be a relatively small portion of the bank’s liabilities, which stood at $1.56 trillion at Sept 30. Even with the debt issuance, Wells Fargo will be able to post modest growth in net interest income, a measure of profits from lending, in 2016 from 2015, Shrewsberry said. The issuance will allow Wells Fargo to comply with new rules that aim to ensure that some of the biggest and most interconnected U.S. banks have enough equity capital and long-term debt to withstand crises. Separately, the bank has developed systems that will allow it to approve consumer loans quickly, to compete more effectively with peer-to-peer lenders like LendingClub Corp, , Shrewsberry said at a conference. He questioned the “durability” of many consumer loan startups once interest rates and defaults begin to rise and said Wells Fargo was more excited by payment technologies. Wells Fargo is developing customer authentication technology, he said. Also is in the works are “a series of things that bring us closer to merchants like location-based services,” such as being able to offer a coupon to a customer who happens to be driving past a favorite store.

1250,WFC,U.S.-based stock funds attract $5.7 billion in latest week: Lipper,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S.-based stock funds posted their fourth straight week of net new money as investors pumped $4.4 billion into banks, technology and real estate during the week that ended Nov. 4, Lipper data showed on Thursday. The gains were the biggest in months for mutual funds and exchange-traded funds in each of those sectors, and more than offset weaker appetites for energy, healthcare and utility stocks. The inflows were led by funds focused on U.S.-listed companies, including the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund which holds stocks of Wells Fargo & Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and other banks. It took in $1.2 billion during the week, Lipper said. The fund’s share price has risen 6.2 percent over the last month. By contrast, the actively traded broad-market SPDR S&P; 500 ETF had $1.2 billion in outflows. Banks would earn more interest-based revenue if the U.S. central bank tightens credit. “The Federal Reserve continued to jawbone the market with additional hawkish comments about the potential for an interest rate hike in December,” said Pat Keon, a research analyst at Lipper, in a note. Overall, domestic-focused stock funds took in $4.3 billion during the week, while non-domestic stock funds raked in $1.4 billion. “For the lion’s share of the year, money was coming out of domestic equity funds,” Keon said in an interview. “This could be a reversal of that trend.” High-yield bond funds, which often move in tandem with stocks, nabbed $2 billion of new money during the week, bringing the five-week total to $9.6 billion. That is the longest period of gains for junk debt funds since a six-week stretch from late January to early March, in which the inflow totaled $11.4 billion. U.S.-based money-market funds posted $13.8 billion in outflows during the week, marking their largest outflows since April. Yet emerging-market debt funds, many brutalized by sliding currencies, posted their second straight week of withdrawals, of $218 million. Taxable bond funds saw $100 million in outflows over the same period. ETF investors took $1.6 billion out of those funds, while mutual fund investors added $1.5 billion in new money, according to Lipper. Investors took more than $2 billion in cash out of investment-grade corporate debt and Treasury funds. And precious-metals commodities funds, which are often used to guard against inflation, had $583 million in outflows during the week. The weekly Lipper fund flow data is compiled from reports issued by U.S.-domiciled mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.

1252,WFC,UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo says no immediate plans to buy a UK-based asset manager,"* Report says considering takeovers of Henderson and Jupiter * Shares in both asset managers up around 2.5 pct By Angus Berwick LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo has no immediate plans to buy an asset manager in Britain, the U.S. bank’s regional president said, after a newspaper report said it was considering moves for several firms. The Sunday Times said the fourth largest U.S. bank was considering takeovers of British fund managers including Henderson and Jupiter - worth 3.3 billion pounds ($5 billion) and 2.1 billion pounds respectively - to spearhead an expansion abroad. But Jim Johnston, president of the bank’s Europe, Middle East and Africa division, told Reuters: “We don’t have any immediate plans to acquire a UK-based investment firm.” Analysts said the report was believable, but doubted any takeovers were imminent. “The asset management industry is ripe for consolidation, with a bank, insurance company and/or larger asset manager all possible acquirers,” Peter Lenardos, analyst for RBC Capital Markets, said in a note. “The weaker British pound against the U.S. dollar makes a takeover of a UK-listed asset manager particularly attractive,” he added. The report follows speculation of other deals in the British asset management sector. Aberdeen Asset Management  denied in October a report that said it was looking for a buyer after an extended stock price decline.. Shares in both Henderson and Jupiter hit three-month highs following the report, although they handed back some of their gains following Wells Fargo’s comments.

1257,WFC,CORRECTED-Wells Fargo likely to issue more debt to comply with new rules,"(In first sentence, corrects expected debt issuance to $40 billion to $60 billion, not $20 billion to $40 billion) By Dan Freed NEW YORK, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co will likely need to issue an additional $40 billion to $60 billion of long-term debt to comply with new rules designed to help banks better weather a crisis, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on Friday. The debt issuance would be a relatively small portion of the bank’s liabilities, which stood at $1.56 trillion at Sept 30. Even with the debt issuance, Wells Fargo will be able to post modest growth in net interest income, a measure of profits from lending, in 2016 from 2015, Shrewsberry said. The issuance will allow Wells Fargo to comply with new rules that aim to ensure that some of the biggest and most interconnected U.S. banks have enough equity capital and long-term debt to withstand crises.

1261,WFC,Wells Fargo CEO complains about Fed debt issuance requirement,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co CEO John Stumpf said on Tuesday he disagrees with a new rule designed to boost one of the bank’s cushions for absorbing losses. The Federal Reserve’s regulation, known as the “total loss absorbing capacity” rule, or TLAC, will require the bank to issue another $60 billion of long-term debt.   Asked in an interview on CNBC whether the $60 billion of total loss absorbing capacity makes the bank safer, Stumpf replied, “Now you’re really getting under my neck a little bit, but I don’t think that’s something that we really needed.”  He added, however, that the bank would be able to manage the issuance. The TLAC requirements, proposed Oct. 30, are aimed at ensuring that some of the biggest and most interconnected banks can better withstand another financial crisis by turning some of their debt, particularly debt issued by their holding companies, into equity without disrupting markets or requiring a government bailout.  The requirement is more difficult for Wells because the bank relies more on deposits, which are less costly than long-term debt, to fund its operations. Securities firms like Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, which fund themselves with long-term debt, are not expected to have to issue new debt to comply with the rule. A Fed spokesman declined to respond to Stumpf’s criticism, but pointed to a statement by Fed Chair Janet Yellen the day the rule was proposed. Yellen said the rule “would substantially reduce the risk to taxpayers and the threat to financial stability” from the failure of systemically important firms such as Wells.

1264,WFC,"Confidence, not rates, is key for U.S. economy- Wells Fargo CEO","Dec 8 (Reuters) - Still-fragile consumer confidence, rather than expected interest rate hikes, is the most important factor holding back a stronger U.S. economic recovery, Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf said on Tuesday. “Nobody’s going to not buy a house because the mortgage rates went up 25 or 50 basis points,” Stumpf said in New York at a conference hosted by Goldman Sachs. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points later this month for the first time in more than nine years though the U.S. economic recovery is still weak by some measures such as wage growth. Stumpf expressed surprise consumers have not been spending the money they are saving from low gasoline prices. “Part of that’s confidence,” said Stumpf, who also blamed regulations. Asked whether banks would compete aggressively for customer deposits once the Fed begins rate hikes, Stumpf said probably not, since lending is not especially attractive from a risk-reward perspective. “I happen to think we will see a tepid response for the first couple of moves especially. It’s just not enough to matter and I don’t know what the liquidity is going to be used for,” Stumpf said. Stumpf said he sees the best opportunity for the bank in its wealth and investment management business, despite strong performance so far. Citing recent performance, Stumpf said, “it’s a very very good business, but it could be a number of factors times that.”   (Reporting by Dan Freed in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)",12082015,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-rates/confidence-not-rates-is-key-for-u-s-economy-wells-fargo-ceo-idUSL1N13X0W220151208

Wells Fargo has the largest exposure to oil and gas industry among the big U.S. banks, with its lending to the energy industry, accounting for about 2 percent of its overall loan portfolio in the third quarter ended Sept 30. Kyle Hranicky, who spent nine years at the helm of the Houston-based Wells Fargo Energy Group before rising to head the corporate banking in May, said the bank had been in discussions with energy industry clients for several months about preserving cash and cutting borrowing limits, the FT reported.  Some oil and gas companies have the liquidity to survive the cycle, but others will be under significant stress and may be forced to sell assets or recapitalize, he said. A recent U.S. regulatory review could force banks to scale back loans to energy companies whose revenues have been hit hard by falling oil prices, and could force more oil drillers into bankruptcy, industry analysts have said.

1271,WFC,Wells Fargo eyes insurance brokerage acquisitions,"Dec 16 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co is restarting efforts to expand its insurance brokerage business through acquisitions after previously announced M&A; aspirations did not pan out. Laura Schupbach, evp and head of Wells Fargo Insurance, said she “hit the pause button” on plans to do deals after she determined when taking the reins of the business four years ago that existing businesses were not fully integrated after earlier deals over a period of about 15 years. Schupbach cited technology platforms and contracts with insurance carriers as examples of inconsistencies that have now been addressed across the bank’s 2500 person insurance brokerage and consulting unit. Having resolved those issues and “upgraded talent,” Wells Fargo is again looking at M&A;, Schupbach said in an interview. “We’re very interested in building out industry expertise,” Schupbach said on Tuesday. She cited industries including healthcare, hospitals and agriculture as possible targets. In terms of size of a deal, she said Wells Fargo would prefer to target larger companies as they are “used to serving clients with more sophisticated needs.” On the low end, Schupbach said “Could it be $20-50 million? Maybe.” She declined to comment regarding the possible high end of the range and added that she can grow the business without acquisitions if necessary. Wells told Reuters in August it is selling its crop insurance business, thought to be valued at $1 billion. Elaborating on those plans, Schupbach said Wells targeted the business for sale because it does not provide as much opportunity as the bank’s other insurance business lines to serve bank consumer and commercial customers.

Bank of New York Mellon Corp and units of Deutsche Bank AG, Wells Fargo & Co and HSBC Holdings Plc were named in the lawsuits filed on Wednesday and Thursday in Manhattan federal court.

1276,WFC,Wells Fargo wealth unit shows strain of great expectations,"(Reuters) - It may be Wells Fargo & Co’s CEO’s favorite business, but the company’s wealth management unit’s closely watched trust and investment fees declined in the fourth quarter.  Choppy markets in the quarter cut Wells Fargo’s trust and investment fee revenue by 5 percent to $3.51 billion. That figure includes brokerage advisory, commissions and other fees, trust and investment management and investment banking. Such fees are closely watched by analysts to assess the health of the wealth business. The unit offers mutual funds and other investment products, and serves a range of clients from those with more than $50 million in assets served by its Abbot Downing brand to mass market consumers. In the brutal revenue environment since the financial crisis, Wells Fargo and other banks have turned increasingly to wealth management to boost returns.  But because of competitive pressures, tougher regulations and ever shakier markets, that strategy has produced less-than-sterling numbers at Wells. The unit grew revenues according to the measure the bank uses, which includes interest income. Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg has estimated that Wells rivals Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp’s Merrill Lynch, will post wealth management revenue declines when they report quarterly results on Tuesday. Rafferty Capital Markets analyst Dick Bove said he expects wealth management to be “one of the businesses that’ll do most poorly over the next couple of years” at banks. Wells CEO John Stumpf does not share that view. At a December conference hosted by Goldman Sachs, he called the wealth investment management division the bank’s “biggest opportunity.” Stumpf said Wells Fargo had room to expand its wealth business, noting that the bank has about 11 percent of U.S. deposits, but just 1 to 2 percent of the wealth. “It’s not like the business is not great; it just could be a whole lot bigger,” Stumpf said. Wells Fargo’s ability to sell several products to the same customer is one reason investors value it more generously than banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. But investors are typically reluctant to part with their wealth advisors. “A lot of the clients don’t view it as going with the brand: they trust their individual advisor,” said Michael Mattioli, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management who owns Wells Fargo shares on behalf of clients. CFO John Shrewsberry said Wells Fargo is better than peers at selling wealth management products to retail customers. “We have been recording more than $1 billion per month of closed investment referrals out of the community bank into the wealth and financial advisory business for a couple of years now,” he said in an interview on Friday.  Wells is not relying on internal referrals alone. It struck a deal in October with Credit Suisse Group AG, which is winding down its U.S. private banking business, hoping to gain a leg up on rivals in recruiting financial advisers. However, rivals like UBS and Morgan Stanley have lured away nearly a third of the 270 Credit Suisse brokers despite Wells’ effort to offer generous incentive packages, according to press reports.  On a call with analysts Friday, Shrewsberry said the Credit Suisse brokers Wells Fargo has recruited will not be “a huge game-changer in terms of the numbers.” He said it equated to between three and five months of regular recruitment. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to say how many advisors it recruited. Competition from rival banks is getting tougher. Morgan Stanley has retooled under CEO James Gorman, shrinking its securities division to emphasize wealth management. The business has also grown more prominent at other banks including Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch, UBS Group AG, Bank of New York Mellon Corp and Goldman. The threat from smaller firms has also grown as technology has made it cheaper for advisers to gain access to clearing, marketing and compliance and investment products. Tighter regulation is another issue. A proposed conflict-of-interest rule from the U.S. Labor Department would make it much harder for firms to sell proprietary investment products to clients. A Morningstar report estimates the rule will cost the financial sector at least $2.4 billion annually. The Department of Labor countered it would cost $2.4 to $5.7 billion over 10 years, while saving $17 billion annually for retirees. One advantage for Wells is that it has controlled costs better than rivals have. Bank of America and Morgan Stanley locked up advisors with multiyear guarantees following the financial crisis, while Wells mostly steered clear of those deals. Shrewsberry said if markets do not recover and Wells Fargo does not gather new assets, the impact on annual net income would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. He compared that to the $23 billion the bank earned in 2015. “It’s - in the scheme of things - a manageable outcome,” he said.

1277,WFC,Fitch: Wells Fargo Reports Solid 4Q15 Results,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 15 (Fitch) Wells Fargo & Company (WFC) reported fourth quarter  2015 (4Q15) results of $5.7 billion in net income for a return on assets (ROA)  of 1.27%, down 1.5% from last quarter. Earnings have remained relatively  consistent over the last five quarters, hovering at  around the $5.7 billion  mark.  Earnings during the quarter were supported by both spread income and controlled  expenses. This was partially offset by higher provision expenses and a large  drop in equity gains, which tend to be the most volatile line item in WFC's  earnings.  Fitch views these results as in line with expectations for WFC, one of the  strongest and most consistent earnings profiles in the industry. The quarter's  results were comparatively stronger than big banks reporting to date given the  U.S.-based focused franchise and absence of capital markets reliance. At year-end 2015, WFC's direct exposure to energy lending is modest at less than  2% of total loans. WFC reported $118 million in net charge-offs (NCOs) or  approximately 2.7% of energy balances on an annualized basis in 4Q15, with $843  million of non-accrual balances. WFC also reported one of the highest reserve  coverage ratios yet at 7% of oil and gas loans. The reserve was based on  customer-by-customer analysis, as well as the forward curve for oil prices,  which are higher than current prices of around $30. WFC's balance of energy-related available-for-sale securities and nonmarketable  securities was $2.5 billion. During the quarter, WFC realized $251 million in  OTTI primarily reflecting marks on energy sector debt and equity investments.  Spread income increased 1.4% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily supported by  growth in loans and securities, as well as higher variable income. Core loan  growth was 2% on a linked-quarter basis, while securities balances grew 1%.  WFC's margin fell 4bps due to continued strong deposit growth, as well as higher  funding costs as WFC issued more long-term debt in preparation for the  previously announced GE capital deals. The GE Railcar Services acquisition  closed on Jan. 1, 2016, and it is anticipated that the commercial distribution  and vendor finance purchase will close in late 1Q16.  Noninterest income declined 4% primarily due to lower equity gains, partially  offset by improved gains on debt securities and trading. Market-sensitive  revenues, which include gains and losses on equity investments, trading  activities, and debt securities, combined with investment banking fees, were  around 6% of total revenues, and can be volatile from quarter to quarter.  However, this level of capital markets revenues is well below WFC's large bank  peers.  Expenses were flat on a sequential basis, primarily due to higher personnel,  equipment and outside professional services, offset by lower operating losses  and foreclosed real estate expenses. Furthermore, last quarter included a  charitable contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation that did not repeat. The  full-year efficiency ratio was 57.8%, at the higher end of its targeted 55% to  59% efficiency ratio. WFC expects to operate at the higher end of that range in  2016.  For the second quarter in a row, WFC reported the absence of a reserve release  with provision expenses equaling NCOs. WFC attributed the lack of a reserve  release to continued improvement in residential real estate, offset by  deterioration in the energy sector.  Total loan losses ticked up 5bps to a still low 36bps during the quarter due  primarily to the previously mentioned energy-related loan losses. Fitch notes  that at 36bps, WFC's current losses remain well below historical averages for  the company, and we expect some mean reversion for WFC and the industry over the  near- to medium-term. Non-accrual balances fell 4% on a linked-quarter basis  reflecting broad improvement across consumer and commercial loan categories,  offset by energy-related deterioration.  The estimated Common Equity Tier 1 under Basel III Standardized Approach, fully  phased-in, was 10.7% at quarter-end, up approximately 5bps on a linked-quarter  basis. In terms of potential TLAC issuances, WFC reaffirmed its estimate of  between $40 billion to $60 billion in issuance, which Fitch views as very  achievable given an extended phased-in period.

Shrewsberry said if markets do not recover and Wells Fargo does not gather new assets, the impact on annual net income would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. He compared that to the $23 billion the bank earned in 2015. “It’s - in the scheme of things - a manageable outcome,” he said.

1286,WFC,U.S. brokerages consider revamping procedures to prevent bad trades,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. brokerages are taking steps to change the way their agents trade in an attempt to protect clients from the next big selloff. Wells Fargo & Co, for instance, has instituted an early-warning system that interrupts brokers and advisers trying to enter stop-loss orders, which were accused of inflaming the August “flash crash” and resulting in deep losses for some investors. Bank of America Corp’s Merrill Lynch unit is discussing whether to ban such orders altogether, according to people outside the company aware of those conversations. Investors with advisers and brokers were among those scarred Aug. 24 when U.S. markets sank so quickly that trading in many stocks and exchange-traded funds was repeatedly halted. Now, when Wells Fargo advisers place stop-losses on ETFs, closed-end funds and some other securities, they see a pop-up warning suggesting a “limit” order that could be processed only at a certain price or better. Analyses of summertime trading glitches by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, ETF issuer BlackRock Inc and the New York Stock Exchange blamed stop-loss orders as a primary issue on Aug. 24, warping the market’s ability to absorb sales of stocks and ETFs. [nL1N14I1A3] [nL1N1262HK] [nL2N15C3IV] Stop-loss orders allow investors to automatically sell an investment after it hits a pre-determined price. They are used by investors hoping to minimize losses. The problem is that once the target price is reached, stop-losses become “market” orders and are executed at the next available price. During fast sell-offs a stock or ETF’s price can crash through the stop-loss level, causing the investment to be sold at a lower price. This happened on Aug. 24 when some ETFs and stocks sank 30 percent or more from their prior-day close minutes after trading started, only to recover later that day. Analysts have said making changes to order types could help prevent fast selloffs. The NYSE, owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc, is no longer accepting stop-losses itself. But the exchange said most such orders are launched by brokerages; when a brokerage executes a trade triggered by a stop-loss order, it comes to the exchange simply as a market order. Wells has 15,000 advisers and brokers that manage $1.6 trillion; Merrill has 16,000 such agents that manage $2.5 trillion. The top four wealth managers by assets - Wells, Merrill, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG - hold $407 billion of the $2.2 trillion in U.S. ETFs, according to Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. A Merrill spokeswoman said the company is educating its advisers on limit orders. Charles Schwab Corp said it still offers stop orders and warns clients of the risks.

1287,WFC,Wells Fargo to pay $1.2 bln in U.S. mortgage fraud settlement,"Feb 3 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Wednesday it had agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle claims that it engaged in mortgage fraud, resolving a major U.S. lawsuit brought in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan in 2012 accusing Wells Fargo, the country’s largest mortgage lender, of engaging in misconduct in originating and underwriting government-insured mortgages. The lawsuit, brought by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office, was among a series of cases against banks following the financial crisis stemming from mortgages insured through a program by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Several lenders including Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc and Deutsche Bank AG have resolved similar lawsuits over FHA-insured loans, paying hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. Wells Fargo said the settlement was reached on Feb. 1 and would also resolve claims by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. (1.usa.gov/1JXUnNe) The 2012 lawsuit accused Wells Fargo of engaging in a “reckless” mortgage origination and underwriting practices from 2001 to 2005. It also said Wells Fargo had failed to report more than 6,000 loans from 2002 to 2010 that did not meet requirements for insurance under the Federal Housing Administration and failed to properly review early payment defaults. Beyond naming Wells Fargo as a defendant, the civil lawsuit named Kurt Lofrano, a vice president at the bank accused of playing a “critical role” in not reporting the loans to government officials. It was not clear if the settlement applied to Lofrano. But a letter filed later on Wednesday by lawyers who work with Bharara said the deal resolves “all claims in this matter.” The letter said the full agreement was still being drafted and needed to be approved by Justice Department officials. The parties plan to provide a status report to the court by Feb. 17, the letter said. A spokesman for Bharara declined comment. The case is U.S. v.

1293,WFC,Big banks see the need to shrink – but face a path full of obstacles,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - When the U.S. Federal Reserve’s newest policymaker Neel Kashkari dropped a bombshell with a call to break up big banks on Tuesday, it was met with a predictably indignant response from their lobbyists. One described his comments as “blind.”     But while no one in the executive suites of major global banks would want authorities to force them to split up or downsize, many top bankers acknowledge that their institutions might be better off smaller and simpler. They just worry that any major restructuring could go all wrong because of the way post-financial crisis regulations are applied.     In interviews with Reuters, six senior bankers said they are struggling with the costs and restrictions they face as a result of new regulations, as well as a weak global economy and troubled financial markets. The bankers, who are or recently were in positions ranging from business division head to CEO, spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could be candid without upsetting regulators or investors. “Fundamentally, the business has to change,” said one veteran banker who was on the executive committee of a major European bank until recently. Big banks’ shareholder returns have sunk “too low,” he said.     These problems are not new, but they have fresh relevance as Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) confronts questions about its capital adequacy, Barclays PLC (BARC.L) faces pressure to break up and CEOs of big U.S. banks struggle with a loss of investor confidence in their stocks.  (For a graphic of U.S. banks' price-to-book ratios, see  reut.rs/1SG0NDL) Management teams in the U.S. and Europe are now taking a hard look at dramatic business model changes, but none of the options are particularly attractive, the bankers said.     Merging to cut costs and improve margins is out of the question, given the hurdles banks would likely face from regulators who do not want “too-big-to-fail” institutions getting any bigger. Splitting apart is complicated by capital requirements that would make standalone trading businesses economically unfeasible — and by the fact that there are few, if any, buyers for the assets banks want least. Some top bankers say they are left with little choice but to muddle through what they fear will be a long, dark period of weak earnings, angry shareholders and gradual shrinkage. The problem has gotten so bad that Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan recently said on a public conference call that he’d much rather be CEO of a simpler, retail-focused bank like Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), which has only a modest investment banking operation. “Unfortunately,” he said, “there are lots of things I wish for that are not going to come true.” Kashkari’s comments, in his first speech as head of the Minneapolis Fed, were surprising because he is a former Goldman Sachs banker, a Republican, and was a senior Treasury official in President George W. Bush’s administration during the financial crisis. They partly echoed the stance of Bernie Sanders, who has also called for big bank breakups and criticized Hillary Clinton, his rival in the struggle to be the Democratic presidential candidate, for being too close to Wall Street. Some of those vying for the Republican nomination have also criticized regulations brought in after the crisis, saying they would repeal the Dodd-Frank reform law.     In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Kashkari criticized Dodd-Frank’s so-called “living will” rule, which requires banks to show how they can be dismantled in an orderly way if they fail, without creating risk to the broader financial system. Kashkari said he believes the rule would not work in a crisis scenario – that banks would simply be bailed out again. “I challenge anybody who thinks, in a stressed time, we would put these banks through resolution,” he said. “I really don’t think it will happen.” One way to force large financial firms to break up is to “aggressively ratchet up” their capital or leverage requirements, Kashkari said. He warned, though, that banks would likely fight hard against any such proposal. Indeed, Tony Fratto, who worked with Kashkari at the Treasury Department and is now a bank lobbyist at Hamilton Place Strategies, said his former colleague’s comments were out of touch with reality. “This is something like re-opening the barn door after the horse is in the stable,” Fratto said. “Love or hate Dodd-Frank, it’s simply blind to say that it hasn’t significantly improved safety and soundness.” Securities analysts and consultants say that banks are in an unenviable position because moves they might have made in the past to improve profitability have been hindered by regulation. As a result, they have struggled unsuccessfully for years to get their returns on equity above single digits.     “In some ways, banks have become bad utilities,” said Fred Cannon, a bank stock analyst with KBW. “With utilities, you have strict regulation in what you can do and charge, but in the end investors get a reasonable return. With banks, that last piece hasn’t happened.”     Bank executives have long argued that weak returns are a “cyclical” issue that should go away when markets begin to flourish again. But as the industry approaches the eighth anniversary of the financial crisis’s nadir, questions about whether they face a secular rather than a cyclical profit problem have only grown louder. And top bankers are now wondering how they can possibly grow revenue under a sprawling set of global financial regulations that limit what they do, and sometimes conflict with one another.  (For a graphic showing bank earnings and share price performance, see tmsnrt.rs/1mZb4h8)     One common example raised is how new capital rules can penalize banks for being big but also discourage them from getting smaller.     For instance, due to their size, the eight largest U.S. banks must collectively hold $200 billion in extra capital, which weighs on shareholder returns. Included in the capital requirement is a fixed amount each bank must hold to represent “operational risk.” Although the Fed does not explain exactly how it comes up with that figure, it is not just a function of size: Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) must hold 25 percent more operational risk capital than JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the biggest bank in the country. Bank of America has said it’s taken steps to address the Fed’s concerns by cutting back on certain revenue-producing activities that created operational risk. Nonetheless, the bank says it has so far been unable to persuade the Fed to reduce that capital requirement. Its shareholder returns suffer as a result, because revenue is dropping faster than capital costs. “Every bank is trying to figure out, with bigger capital requirements and profit pressure, how can they create acceptable returns for their shareholders,” said John Weisel, an Ernst & Young executive who advises global banks on business strategy.     After years of cost-cutting, he said, CEOs are asking themselves: “We’ve used all the arrows in our quiver, so what are we going to do next?” BREAK-UP DEMANDS     European banks are behind their U.S. competitors in addressing a more regulated environment and, in some cases, are flailing around for answers. Last week, Deutsche Bank shares hit an all-time low on worries that it won’t be able to buy back some bonds that can convert into equity. Deutsche regained some value after it outlined plans to repurchase $5.38 billion worth of other bonds, but investors’ concerns don’t seem to have been entirely assuaged.     Meanwhile, Barclays has come under pressure after a Bernstein analyst wrote an open letter on Feb. 5 imploring CEO Jes Staley to break up the bank.     Rob McDonough, who advises financial institutions on risk management at Angel Oak Consulting Group, says megabanks may have little choice but to get significantly smaller.     “It’s too expensive,” he said, “for banks to be big.” ",2192016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks-soulsearching-insight/big-banks-see-the-need-to-shrink-but-face-a-path-full-of-obstacles-idUSKCN0VS0FE

1298,WFC,Wells Fargo searching for rainmaker in bid to boost dealmaking franchise,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), in a bid to boost its dealmaking franchise, is hunting for a new head of mergers and acquisitions, according to people familiar with the matter.    The bank’s existing head of mergers, John Laughlin, has moved to a vice chairman role, a spokeswoman said.      Wells is looking for a senior dealmaker who can help the bank win roles on high-profile transactions in which it has not historically been a part, the sources said.  Wells, based in San Francisco, has its East Coast headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, which is where Laughlin has been based and where many of its bankers sit - rather than in New York, the hub of Wall Street banking.     “John Laughlin’s appointment to vice chairman recognizes the key role he played in leading a fivefold increase in our M&A; business,” said Rob Engel, head of investment banking and capital markets at Wells Fargo.      Wells has seen its stock price and return on equity rewarded for focusing on wealth management and Main Street lending, and this latest move reflects a desire to build out its investment banking franchise.     Although the bank is consistently ranked as one of the top lenders to corporate America, it has lagged in traditional investment banking areas like financial advisory and capital markets.     The bank posted about $2 billion in U.S. investment banking fees in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data, ranking it eighth among peers. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) generated fees nearly double that of Wells.     Wells captured a 4.7 percent share of U.S investment banking fees, and has climbed less than 1 percent since 2008, when it acquired Wachovia to build up its banking business.    The bank did not crack the Top 20 for advising on announced U.S. mergers and acquisitions last year.     Rival bank executives are convinced Wells may soon make further inroads into investment banking.     “Wells Fargo is very actively, very aggressively, and very successfully building its U.S. investment bank,” JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg in March. Dimon said that for Wells to remain competitive, it will need to expand overseas, which may require buying another bank. Wells, however, has tended to downplay its investment banking ambitions, describing it as one more way to serve corporate customers.  The more modest view has won favor with investors, who have rewarded Wells with a higher price-to-book value than banks such as JPMorgan. Wells trades at 1.48 times book value, compared with JPMorgan’s 1.03 times book.

1300,WFC,"SEC charges Wells Fargo, Rhode Island agency with securities fraud","March 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday charged a Wells Fargo & Co unit and a Rhode Island agency with civil fraud stemming from a bond deal for a now-bankrupt video-game company founded by former Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling. Wells Fargo Securities and Rhode Island’s economic development agency defrauded investors to finance the company, called 38 Studios, the SEC said. The company was named after Schilling’s Major League jersey number. The charge stems from a $75 million bond offering in 2010 that was part of a Rhode Island program intended to spur economic development, the SEC said. Wells Fargo disputes the SEC’s allegations and will respond to them in court, a spokesman said. The state’s economic development agency, the Rhode Island Commerce Corp, is reviewing the SEC’s complaint, a spokeswoman said. The agency previously filed a lawsuit against Wells accusing it of not disclosing material information about the 38 Studios deal to its board and investors, the spokeswoman said. That lawsuit also names two former executives of the agency. The Rhode Island Commerce Corp did not tell investors that 38 Studios faced a funding shortfall to produce a particular video game, the SEC said in its complaint. The state agency loaned $50 million to 38 Studios, which needed another $25 million to produce the game. Unable to get the extra money, 38 Studios defaulted on the loan without producing the video game, the SEC said. Wells and its lead banker in the offering, Peter Cannava, who is also charged in the case, misled investors by not telling them about a side deal with 38 Studios, the SEC said. Wells received nearly double the amount of compensation it had disclosed to investors in offering documents because of that deal, according to the SEC. Cannava’s lawyer, Brian Kelly, said the allegations “lack merit.” Two former executives with the Rhode Island agency, Keith Stokes and James Saul, have already settled charges of abetting the fraud without admitting or denying the allegations, the SEC said. Each will pay a $25,000 penalty and cannot participate in future municipal securities offerings, the SEC said. Their lawyers did not return calls requesting comment. Stokes and Saul are the former executives named in the agency’s own lawsuit. The agency’s financial adviser in the deal, First Southwest Company LLC, settled separate allegations that it violated rules by not properly documenting services it was providing. First Southwest, which the agency is also suing, did not admit or deny the findings. Its lawyer did not return a call requesting comment. When it went under in 2012, 38 Studios said it owed more than $150 million and had less than $22 million in assets. Schilling said the company personally cost him $50 million.",3072016,http://www.reuters.com/article/sec-wells-fargo-fraud/sec-charges-wells-fargo-rhode-island-agency-with-securities-fraud-idUSL1N16F14A

Berkshire owns 506.3 million shares of Wells Fargo, worth about $24.7 billion, mainly through subsidiaries, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The ownership stake has risen from 6.5 percent at the end of 2009 and 9.8 percent as of Dec. 31, according to Buffett. Berkshire has paid close to $13 billion for its Wells Fargo shares, based on Buffett’s shareholder letters and the bank’s recent stock price. Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco, and is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. “We value Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term shareholder and customer and appreciate the confidence that Berkshire’s executive team has shown in Wells Fargo,” a spokesman said. The Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large stakes in banks. In a September 2008 policy statement, the Fed said it often lets investors take double-digit bank stakes not designed to exert a “controlling influence,” but would review any resulting business relationships “case-by-case.” The U.S. Treasury Department, meanwhile, has said it will not deem a 10 percent stake to result in “control” of a big bank if the investor agrees in writing to limits on its involvement. In one of Monday’s filings, Buffett certified that Berkshire’s Wells Fargo shares “were not acquired and are not held” with the intent of changing how the bank operates. Speaking on CNBC television on Feb. 29, Buffett called Wells Fargo “a terrific operation” and said Chief Executive John Stumpf has done a “fabulous job.” As of Dec. 31, Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire also owned a 15.6 percent stake in American Express Co (AXP.N), having crossed the 10 percent threshold two decades earlier.

Wells Fargo has put procedures in place to ensure that disclosures occur at the beginning of the call, company spokesman Tom Goyda said in a statement. The settlement requires Wells to establish procedures to ensure compliance, and appoint a supervisor to oversee those measures. Wells has also agreed to contribute a total of $500,000 to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse in San Diego and the Consumer Protection Trust Fund.

1320,WFC,RPT-Wells Fargo plans quiet assault on Wall Street from glass tower,"(Repeats to additional subscribers with no changes to text) By Dan Freed NEW YORK, March 30 (Reuters) - As Wall Street remakes itself on a former rail yard in the far west of Midtown Manhattan, one surprising name is leading the way. Wells Fargo & Co, the San Francisco-based lender known for its retail banking business, has picked out space for a trading operation to use as a base for a stealth attack on the investment banking world. The bid for more capital markets business - from advising on deals and security issues to trading derivatives - is a potentially risky move by the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. The boom-and-bust of Wall Street offers lucrative fees if Wells Fargo can pick up business left behind by rivals in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, but trading brings extra risks and volatility. Jonathan Weiss, who runs Wells Fargo’s investment banking and trading division, said the bank’s plans were deliberately low-key. “We’re not getting into things that are going to rapidly or dramatically change our business,” he told Reuters in a phone interview earlier this month. “It’s just a consistent, slow build-out. Add a person here, add a person there.” Despite Weiss’s muted tone, Wells Fargo has made some headline-grabbing moves. In December it announced a deal to buy 500,000 square feet - or 10 football fields - of trading and office space at Manhattan’s Hudson Yards development. Its neighbors will include private equity firm KKR & Co and media titan Time Warner Inc. Earlier this month it clinched what is expected to be its most lucrative mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) assignment in at least a decade. And it has acquired a license to trade credit derivatives, so it can take advantage of revival in demand for a product starting to overcome its association with the last financial crisis. Wells Fargo built itself into the world’s most valuable bank - with a market value of $243 billion - in the wake of the financial crisis partly because it did not rely on risky trades or complex derivatives to turn a profit. Its quiet approach may be an acknowledgement that investors are wary of potentially risky Wall Street business and may mark down its shares, which currently trade at a premium to other big U.S. banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. “If I felt the bank were making a big investment banking push, they would need to do a good job of explaining why it has not made them riskier,” said Thomas Russo, managing member at Gardner, Russo & Gardner, the bank’s 43rd largest shareholder. “Otherwise, I would have to revisit the holdings.” Weiss said there was no cause for alarm. “Our pace of growth is not so significant relative to the overall growth the bank has experienced that shareholders need be concerned that somehow we’re growing some massive set of risks,” he said. Wells Fargo’s largest shareholder, Warren Buffett - who has criticized the financial system’s excessive use of derivatives - seems to be on board with the bank’s plans. His Berkshire Hathaway Inc has increased its stake to 10 percent according to regulatory filings on Monday. Buffett declined to comment on whether he thinks the bank will become a riskier investment. OLD-SCHOOL, NEW BUILDING Wells Fargo is still focused on its traditional business of lending to consumers and corporations and managing people’s money. Trading and investment banking accounted for just 4.6 percent of Wells Fargo’s 2015 revenues, with part of the trading coming from outside the securities division, according to a spokeswoman. That compares to about 26 percent for JPMorgan, counting only trading in its investment bank unit, according to its year-end earnings. Wells Fargo sees market share up for grabs as lenders such as Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc  cut back their investment banking business in response to tough post-crisis regulations. Buying offices in a 90-story, glass-and-steel tower overlooking New York’s Hudson River - with a move-in scheduled for 2020 - is a symbolic move that shows the bank is intent on growing rather than making cuts like many Wall Street firms. Nearly one-third of the bank’s office space is to be taken up by two trading floors, according to the developer’s news release in December, but Weiss said it was not yet clear how big the dealing operation would be. “It was important to have the space that can be built out into a trading operation in the hope that we continue to grow,” he said. Wells Fargo’s investment banking and trading operations are currently housed in 350,000 square feet spread across four separate buildings in New York. That represents a big leap for a bank seen as a sleeping giant in the U.S. investment banking industry. It has the balance sheet and lending relationships to be a top player, but a culture more in touch with Main Street than Wall Street. Wells Fargo’s bosses have made fun of Wall Street’s self-importance. Chief Executive John Stumpf, a farmer’s son from Minnesota, likes to say he prefers kitchen tables to “league tables” - the rankings used by investment banks to measure their standing. But as Wall Street rivals exit and low interest rates force banks to look for more sources of revenue, Wells Fargo’s current and former executives see more opportunities. “I had been very vocal in saying I didn’t believe investment banking was culturally compatible with our ethics and our business model,” said former Wells Fargo CEO Richard Kovacevich. “But as a result of the financial crisis, with investment banks becoming banks or being bought by them, the culture has changed,” said the 72-year-old banker, who retired in 2009 but still has an office at Wells Fargo and meets with big investment bank clients. Rivals have noticed the bank’s ramped-up presence. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg earlier this month Wells Fargo was “very actively, very aggressively, and very successfully building its U.S. investment bank.” This month, Wells Fargo was named sole adviser to TransCanada Corp on its acquisition of Columbia Pipeline Group, a deal worth $13 billion including debt, putting it on track for its biggest fees from a single deal since at least 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting Services. Wells Fargo broke into the top 10 for global investment banking fees in 2013 and has stayed there since, according to Thomson Reuters data. It is looking to juice its growth further by hiring a new rainmaker to head its M&A; franchise, leading a team of bankers that has grown by 40 percent over the past five years, outstripping rivals even as M&A; surged across the board. Wells Fargo is also expanding in prime brokerage, a lucrative business offering loans, trading, cash management and other services to hedge funds. It bought mid-sized prime broker Merlin Securities in 2012, expanded it to target larger hedge funds, and still has room to grow, according to Weiss. The bank is also expanding in derivatives that allow investors to bet against companies’ debt, recently getting regulatory approvals to trade single-name and indexed credit default swaps, as well as swaps based on indexes. Such derivatives were blamed for spreading mortgage-related losses during the financial crisis, but they are enjoying a revival as corporate bonds dip on tumbling energy prices and companies look for a way to manage interest rate, commodity price and currency risk. “That has been a big addition and a thoughtful way to take the derivatives question into the board room or into the ‘C-Suite’ as something more than just a trade that you do on a desk,” said Weiss.

The settlement with Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender and third-largest U.S. bank by assets, was filed on Friday in Manhattan federal court. It also resolves claims against Kurt Lofrano, a former Wells Fargo vice president. According to the settlement, Wells Fargo “admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility” for having from 2001 to 2008 falsely certified that many of its home loans qualified for Federal Housing Administration insurance. The San Francisco-based lender also admitted to having from 2002 to 2010 failed to file timely reports on several thousand loans that had material defects or were badly underwritten, a process that Lofrano was responsible for supervising. According to the Justice Department, the shortfalls led to substantial losses for taxpayers when the FHA was forced to pay insurance claims as defective loans soured. Several lenders, including Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co, previously settled similar federal lawsuits. But Wells Fargo held out, and its payment is the largest in FHA history over loan origination violations. Friday’s settlement is a reproach for “years of reckless underwriting” at Wells Fargo, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said in a statement. “While Wells Fargo enjoyed huge profits from its FHA loan business, the government was left holding the bag when the bad loans went bust,” Bharara added. The accord also resolved a probe by federal prosecutors in California of alleged false loan certifications by American Mortgage Network LLC, which Wells Fargo bought in 2009. No one has been criminally charged in the probes, and the Justice Department reserved the right to pursue criminal charges if it wishes, according to the settlement. Franklin Codel, president of Wells Fargo Home Lending, in a statement said the settlement “allows us to put the legal process behind us, and to focus our resources and energy on what we do best — serving the needs of the nation’s homeowners.” Lewis Liman, a lawyer for Lofrano, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

1331,WFC,Wells Fargo admits deception in $1.2 billion U.S. mortgage accord,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) admitted to deceiving the U.S. government into insuring thousands of risky mortgages, as it formally reached a record $1.2 billion settlement of a U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit. The settlement with Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender and third-largest U.S. bank by assets, was filed on Friday in Manhattan federal court. It also resolves claims against Kurt Lofrano, a former Wells Fargo vice president. According to the settlement, Wells Fargo “admits, acknowledges, and accepts responsibility” for having from 2001 to 2008 falsely certified that many of its home loans qualified for Federal Housing Administration insurance. The San Francisco-based lender also admitted to having from 2002 to 2010 failed to file timely reports on several thousand loans that had material defects or were badly underwritten, a process that Lofrano was responsible for supervising. According to the Justice Department, the shortfalls led to substantial losses for taxpayers when the FHA was forced to pay insurance claims as defective loans soured. Several lenders, including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N), Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), previously settled similar federal lawsuits. But Wells Fargo held out, and its payment is the largest in FHA history over loan origination violations. Friday’s settlement is a reproach for “years of reckless underwriting” at Wells Fargo, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan said in a statement. “While Wells Fargo enjoyed huge profits from its FHA loan business, the government was left holding the bag when the bad loans went bust,” Bharara added. The accord also resolved a probe by federal prosecutors in California of alleged false loan certifications by American Mortgage Network LLC, which Wells Fargo bought in 2009. No one has been criminally charged in the probes, and the Justice Department reserved the right to pursue criminal charges if it wishes, according to the settlement. Franklin Codel, president of Wells Fargo Home Lending, in a statement said the settlement “allows us to put the legal process behind us, and to focus our resources and energy on what we do best — serving the needs of the nation’s homeowners.” Lewis Liman, a lawyer for Lofrano, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Wells Fargo on Feb. 3 said the settlement would reduce its previously reported 2015 profit by $134 million, to account for extra legal expenses. The case is U.S. v. Wells Fargo Bank NA, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-07527.

The Office of Financial Research, a financial stability watchdog housed within the U.S. Treasury Department, studied the systemic importance of the world’s largest banks using 2014 data from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. It then assigned a score to each bank based on factors including size, complexity, interconnectedness and cross-jurisdictional activity, as well as how easily the products they offer can be provided by competitors. Regulators define systemically important banks as those whose failure could pose a threat to the global financial system. The report listed four banks as having become “significantly” more important: Wells Fargo, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (601398.SS), Agricultural Bank of China (601288.SS) and Bank of China (601988.SS). With a score of 202.6, Wells Fargo was far from being the biggest threat to the system. By contrast, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) had a score of 494.7, which was the highest.

1336,WFC,Wells Fargo profit falls 7 percent as bad loan provisions surge,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s (WFC.N) quarterly profit fell 7 percent as the No. 3 U.S. bank by assets set aside more than $1 billion to cover bad loans, saying its energy portfolio remained under “significant stress.” Shares of Wells Fargo, which has said that nearly 2 percent of its loans are to the energy industry, fell 0.5 percent to $48.80 in afternoon trading on Thursday.  Income from all three businesses declined, with its largest business - community banking - reporting a 7 percent fall in the first quarter ended March 31. “The increases in losses and nonperforming loans in the first quarter were primarily due to continued challenges” in the oil and gas portfolio, Chief Risk Officer Mike Loughlin said in a statement. Oil prices have dropped by two-thirds since 2014, gutting the global energy markets and driving a string of bankruptcies as debt-laden drillers default on their loans. About a third of listed oil and gas-related companies, with more than $150 billion in debt, are at high risk of bankruptcy this year, auditing and consulting firm Deloitte has said. This week alone, Peabody Energy Corp (BTU.N), the biggest U.S. coal miner, and Energy XXI Ltd EXXI.O, a major oil and gas producer in Louisiana, Texas and the Gulf of Mexico, filed for bankruptcy. Commercial and industrial loans, including those to oil and gas firms, rose 7 percent from the fourth quarter to $321.55 billion. Non-interest costs rose 4 percent as the bank shelled out more for employee benefits and compensation. Wells Fargo’s mortgage banking revenue rose 3.3 percent to $1.6 billion. Although Wells is the largest U.S. mortgage lender by assets, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) topped Wells in that category during the quarter, at $1.9 billion. Wells Fargo was among the five big banks failed by U.S. regulators on Wednesday on their plans for a bankruptcy that would not rely on taxpayer money.  The net income applicable to common shareholders fell to $5.09 billion, or 99 cents per share, but total revenue rose 4.3 percent to $22.2 billion. The results, however, beat Wall Street’s lowered expectations of a profit of 97 cents per share and revenue of $21.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Loans regulators define as “criticized” rose to nearly $30 billion as of March 31 from about $18.5 billion at the end of 2015, the filing said. The remaining $290.5 billion of Wells Fargo’s commercial and industrial loan portfolio was classified as “pass.” Criticized loans range from those with potential weaknesses to essentially worthless ones that should no longer count as assets on bank balance sheets. Wells Fargo’s total energy-related exposure, including funded and unfunded loans, decreased $317 million to $43.5 billion in the quarter, the filing said.  Wells Fargo and other banks have beefed up reserves for possible loan losses as sharply lower oil prices have made it difficult for energy companies to repay their debts. Wells Fargo has been one of the most aggressive large banks in providing equity and second lien financing to small exploration and production companies in the sector. In its quarterly filing on Friday, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) said its criticized loans to the oil and gas industry more than doubled to $9.7 billion at the end of March. Wells Fargo did not specify what portion of its oil and gas loans were criticized.

1351,WFC,Wells Fargo told staff to keep quiet about missing papers: lawsuit,"(Reuters) - A former employee accused Wells Fargo & Co of instructing workers at a call center to refrain from telling customers about lost deeds or other missing documents, and of firing the worker who called the policy unethical, according to a lawsuit made public this week. Duke Tran, who was a customer service specialist at the bank, says that his supervisor berated him for telling a husband and wife that their loan contract was missing from an internal system. Tran and others later received an email instructing them not to tell customers about situations “where we have a lost contract, deed, any type of document, really, but especially when it relates to securing a property,” according to a copy of the email filed with the lawsuit. The email told the employees “to say that we need to do further research or something similar” and then to escalate the phone call to a boss. Representatives for Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, declined to comment on Friday. Like other major lenders, Wells Fargo has been battered by lawsuits over its conduct before and after the 2008 financial crisis. Last month, it admitted to deceiving the U.S. government into insuring thousands of risky mortgages and agreed to pay $1.2 billion. The U.S. Department of Justice had an option to join Tran in his case because his suit alleges fraud on the government. It has declined to do so. That is typically a sign the department thinks a lawsuit is unlikely to succeed.  Tran filed his lawsuit in June 2015 under court seal, which is common for suits alleging fraud on the government. U.S. District Judge Anna Brown in Portland, Oregon, ordered the papers unsealed on Thursday. The lawsuit seeks damages and an injunction. Tran’s trouble began around December 2013 when he took a call from a husband and wife about an upcoming balloon payment on a mortgage, according to the lawsuit.  Tran told them the bank’s copy of the loan contract was missing, and when he reported the issue to a supervisor, he was told his job was in jeopardy, the suit says.  Other customers also had loan documents missing, and many of their loans had been acquired by Wells Fargo from First Union or SunTrust Bank, according to the lawsuit. Tran was fired in November 2014 after more than 10 years with the bank, the lawsuit said.

1356,WFC,"Wells Fargo lowers financial targets, cuts energy loan exposure","(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co lowered two key financial targets on Tuesday and said it was sharply cutting exposure to troubled energy loans, signaling that tough times for bank profits may continue through the rest of the year. Low interest rates, higher capital requirements and increasing credit costs are weighing on Wells Fargo’s results, prodding the San Francisco-based lender to reduce its targets for returns on assets and on shareholder equity. In a presentation pegged to its biennial investor day event, Wells said it was targeting a return on assets of 1.1 percent to 1.4 percent this year, down from the 1.3 to 1.6 percent it detailed at its investor day in 2014. The bank’s full-year return-on-equity target was now 11 percent to 14 percent, down from 12 percent to 15 percent. Analysts said they were expecting the news, given the difficulties banks face in terms of interest rates, markets and regulations. “We don’t view Wells Fargo’s cuts to its target as surprising,” Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden said in a note.  Since Wells Fargo’s 2014 guidance, it has taken steps to prepare for lower interest rates for a longer period of time. As a result, the bank said it would benefit less if interest rates suddenly jolt upward. Federal Reserve officials recently signaled that the U.S. central bank could be on track to raise interest rates in June or July.  Wells said it now expected its net interest margin would rise 5 to 15 basis points if the yield curve shifted upward by 100 basis points. Its prior expectation was for a net interest margin benefit of 10 to 30 basis points from such a move. A basis point is one hundredth of 1 percent. Energy loans have been a sore spot for banks in recent quarters due to the long-running oil price rout that put many borrowers in dire financial straits. Wells Fargo was particularly aggressive in lending to energy companies when the sector was booming, and it was now taking steps to reduce its exposure. Wells Fargo’s finance chief, John Shrewsberry, said the bank was more than halfway through a reassessment of loans to energy companies involved in exploration and production, and has cut credit lines for 68 percent of those it has reviewed. In its presentation, Wells said it expected “continued stress” in its book of oil and gas loans throughout 2016. “More credit losses will be realized and there is the potential for additional reserve builds,” the bank added.

Roboadvisers manage client money using algorithms rather than traditional human brokers, and have been popular with investors who want to pay lower fees or prefer digital options. Wells Fargo’s planned deal will allow it to capture smaller clients who want to manage their own investments, David Carroll, head of wealth and investment management, said at the bank’s investor day. “We are working hard, fast and furious to adopt [a roboadviser] capability at Wells Fargo,” he said, without providing further details about the partner or size of the deal. Roboadvisers have lower costs and offer smaller fees than traditional firms partly because they do not have to pay an army of brokers to sell their products.

1360,WFC,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Wells Fargo lowers targets for returns on equity, assets","(Removes word “annual” from last paragraph.) May 24 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co lowered two key companywide financial targets on Tuesday, citing low interest rates, higher credit and compliance costs and increased regulatory capital requirements. The San Francisco-based lender now targets a return on assets of 1.1 percent to 1.4 percent this year, down from the 1.3 to 1.6 percent it detailed in 2014. Its full-year return-on-equity target is now 11 percent to 14 percent, down from 12 percent to 15 percent. Since Wells Fargo’s 2014 guidance, it has taken actions to prepare for lower interest rates for a longer period of time.

1363,WFC,Wells Fargo stays coy as investment bank grows,"NEW YORK, May 25 (IFR) - To the surprise of exactly no one, Wells Fargo played down talk of expansion in its investment banking business during this week’s investor day presentations. The world’s biggest bank by market cap remains coy about its ambitions, deflecting analyst questions and trying to assuage concerns about mission creep into uncharted waters. But ever since JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon said earlier this year that Wells was aggressively building its investment bank - and that it was “almost impossible” to build one from scratch - the bank has been a bit on the defensive about the issue. Jon Weiss, the head of the investment banking Wells Fargo Securities arm, walked the tightrope, acknowledging that the unit was growing while trying very hard to say it really wasn’t. “We are not talking about a massive investment in a new business,” he said. “To the extent that we are growing, we are going to do it the Wells Fargo way - with discipline.” That appeared to rule out any possibility that Wells would opt to acquire an investment bank, which Dimon’s decree suggested was the bank’s only way forward. “The likelihood that would ever make an acquisition in investment banking is very, very remote,” said Tim Sloan, Wells Fargo’s head of wholesale banking. “We don’t think that we need to do it.” Many analysts agree with that assessment. Rafferty Capital analyst Dick Bove said Wells Fargo already has the distribution, capital and customer base to break into the top ranks of investment banking without an acquisition. “Of the top six banks, five are trading at a discount to book value,” he told IFR. “The one bank that isn’t is arguing that they don’t get involved in areas of high risk,” Bove said. “Wells Fargo’s dilemma is that if it says it is aggressively moving into capital market activities, the multiple on its stock will go down.” Weiss insists the bank has actually been lowering risk even as it expands. “While we have built out activities such as liquid products, mortgages and prime brokerage - and our business has grown consistently over the years - value-at-risk and other measures of risk have actually gone down,” he said. For now, the bank said, Wells Fargo Securities accounts for roughly 6% of overall revenue and said it would likely stay in that range. The group has about 4,500 industry and product investment bankers, sales and trading professionals research and analysts and support staff. More than 90% of its revenue comes from the United States, and 95% of its team members are based in the US. The investment bank derives roughly 60% of its revenue from origination and 40% from trading; fixed income represents about 28% of that, compared to 13% from equity trading. Sales and trading is focused on distributing and making markets in securities issued by clients, rather than trading for the sake of trading, Weiss said. In origination, real estate is the bank’s largest sector, accounting for 28% of revenue, followed by consumer, healthcare and gaming at 19%. As it builds into new segments, Weiss said, Wells would focus on hiring people, rather than paying a premium to buy a business. He said building as it goes gives Wells the freedom to design and scale new businesses based on current client needs, consistent with the new regulatory framework. That also allows the bank to avoid the legacy issues that plagued JP Morgan and Bank of America, he said. For his part Sloan, the head of wholesale banking, said the times have simply changed. “People have realized that you can’t prostitute your balance sheet to get a fee.”   (Reporting by Philip Scipio; Editing by Marc Carnegie)",5252016,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-investorday/wells-fargo-stays-coy-as-investment-bank-grows-idUSL2N18M1B4

1379,WFC,Berkshire seeks to boost its Wells Fargo stake above 10 percent,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) is seeking permission from the Federal Reserve to increase its ownership stake in Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), after reaching the 10 percent level that could prompt increased regulatory scrutiny. According to papers obtained by Reuters on Friday, Berkshire said it learned in mid-March that its Wells Fargo stake, including 2.01 million shares held by Buffett, had reached 10.01 percent because of buybacks by the San Francisco-based bank, which decreased the number of shares outstanding. Though the stake later dipped to 9.97 percent, Berkshire said it has again risen above 10 percent because of more buybacks by Wells, which is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. Berkshire said it has bought no Wells Fargo shares since Oct. 21. “Berkshire is seeking permission to retain its current ownership position in Wells Fargo and to acquire additional shares of common stock of Wells Fargo for investment purposes,” according to the papers, which were dated June 14 and submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large bank stakes. Berkshire said it had no dollar value in mind for purchases, had no plans to make significant changes to Wells Fargo’s strategy or corporate structure, and was not contemplating changes to the bank’s management or board. Bloomberg News earlier reported the paperwork. Berkshire’s investment in Wells Fargo is worth more than $23 billion. “We value Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term shareholder and customer, and we appreciate the confidence that Berkshire’s executive team has shown,” Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said an email. Buffett has long been a supporter of Wells Fargo, calling it “very well run” and a “terrific operation,” and saying that Chief Executive John Stumpf has done a “fabulous job.” The Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large bank stakes. In a September 2008 policy statement, the Fed said it often lets investors take double-digit stakes not designed to exert a “controlling influence,” but would review any resulting business relationships “case-by-case.” The U.S. Treasury Department has said it will not deem a 10 percent stake to result in “control” of a big bank if an investor agrees in writing to limits on its involvement. Berkshire also owns 15.94 percent of American Express Co (AXP.N), the application and Reuters data show. Based in Omaha, Nebraska, Berkshire also operates close to 90 businesses such as auto insurer Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and various apparel, energy and industrial companies.

Berkshire said it has bought no Wells Fargo shares since Oct. 21. “Berkshire is seeking permission to retain its current ownership position in Wells Fargo and to acquire additional shares of common stock of Wells Fargo for investment purposes,” according to the papers, which were dated June 14 and submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large bank stakes. Berkshire said it had no dollar value in mind for purchases, had no plans to make significant changes to Wells Fargo’s strategy or corporate structure, and was not contemplating changes to the bank’s management or board. Bloomberg News earlier reported the paperwork. Berkshire’s investment in Wells Fargo is worth more than $23 billion. “We value Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term shareholder and customer, and we appreciate the confidence that Berkshire’s executive team has shown,” Wells Fargo spokesman Ancel Martinez said an email. Buffett has long been a supporter of Wells Fargo, calling it “very well run” and a “terrific operation,” and saying that Chief Executive John Stumpf has done a “fabulous job.” The Federal Reserve exerts special oversight when investors take large bank stakes. In a September 2008 policy statement, the Fed said it often lets investors take double-digit stakes not designed to exert a “controlling influence,” but would review any resulting business relationships “case-by-case.” The U.S. Treasury Department has said it will not deem a 10 percent stake to result in “control” of a big bank if an investor agrees in writing to limits on its involvement. Berkshire also owns 15.94 percent of American Express Co (AXP.N), the application and Reuters data show. Based in Omaha, Nebraska, Berkshire also operates close to 90 businesses such as auto insurer Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and various apparel, energy and industrial companies.

Boosting the stake above 10 percent could mean increased federal scrutiny over the investment. As of March 31, Berkshire was Wells Fargo’s largest investor, with a 9.45 percent stake, Reuters data show. Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco, and is the third-largest U.S. bank by assets.

1388,WFC,Wells Fargo paying entry-level workers higher minimum wage: CFO,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co has been paying entry-level workers more than the federal minimum wage long enough to be reflected in its ordinary operating expenses, a senior executive said on Friday. Wells already pays its lowest ranking employees $12 to 16.50 an hour, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said in an interview. That is the same range JPMorgan Chase & Co recently announced it would raise its minimum wages to over a three-year period. The current U.S. federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, though some states and municipalities around the country have approved, or are working toward, higher minimums. “We started looking at our entry-level workforce a couple of years ago and have gotten already to the, call it, $12-16.50  range,” said Shrewsberry. “It’s built into our run-rate (expenses).” JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in an op-ed in the New York Times on Tuesday that the bank would boost pay for 18,000 low-ranking workers “to help them move up the economic ladder.” The announcement came as large U.S. corporations ranging from banks to coffee purveyors are facing political pressure to pay low-level employees more. Citigroup Inc pays U.S. tellers an average of more than $15.50 an hour, with new and junior staff earning a minimum of about $13 an hour, a spokeswoman said. It is not clear whether those figures are comparable to the ones detailed by JPMorgan. A Bank of America Corp spokesman declined to comment.

1389,WFC,Wells Fargo management prodded on expenses after profit decline,"(Reuters) - Top Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) executives were grilled by analysts on Friday about whether they’re doing enough to control expenses after the bank reported a drop in second-quarter profit. Like its big bank peers, Wells Fargo has been challenged by a prolonged period of historically low interest rates, which only fell further in the second quarter. Even as the San Francisco-based lender extended more loans, its profits fell 3.5 percent because it has started setting aside more money for possible losses in the future. Revenue growth was not enough to offset those increased provisions, as well as higher costs elsewhere. The expense line was boosted by standard operating costs like compliance and personnel, as well as investments in things like biometric scanners and technology to approve loans more quickly. Wells Fargo’s shares fell 3 percent in afternoon trading following the results. At least five analysts asked Chief Executive John Stumpf and Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry about those operating expenses during a conference call on Friday, and whether they can come down any further. Though Wells Fargo is at the high end of a cost-efficiency range that management has set out, the two executives argued that costs are necessary for either day-to-day business or long-term investments that will pay off. “A lower for longer (interest rate) scenario puts pressure on everything that we do,” Stumpf responded to one analyst who acknowledged he might be “beating a dead horse” by asking again about costs. “We are not going to do something that is short-term bright, long-term dull just because of pressure on the revenue side or the earnings side,” Stumpf continued. “We will continue to work really hard on … taking out costs that don’t add value.” Wells, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported net income applicable to common shareholders of $5.2 billion in the second quarter, down from $5.4 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose 4 percent to $22.2 billion. Earnings per share slipped to $1.01 from $1.03, matching the average analyst forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wells Fargo’s second-quarter results compare to better-than-expected profit declines of 1 percent at JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and 14 percent at Citigroup Inc (C.N). All three banks described healthy loan growth in their core businesses, and largely blamed low rates for the profit declines. When rates get too low, the gap between what it costs a bank to obtain funding and what it can earn from investing or lending tends to narrow. Wells’ net interest margin - which measures interest income as a portion of assets - declined on both an annual and quarterly basis. Banks have tried to keep a handle on expenses to offset the impact of low rates. Wells Fargo management has said the bank will keep expenses as a portion of revenue, known as an efficiency ratio, in a range of 55 to 59 percent this year. In the second quarter, its efficiency ratio was 58.1 percent. The industry is also lending more to boost income, a sign of strength for the U.S. economy. Wells reported loan growth across commercial loans, auto loans, credit cards and residential mortgages. Stumpf noted that consumer spending on “big-ticket items was especially robust” during the quarter. Wells Fargo’s $950.8 billion worth of average loans during the quarter was 9 percent above the year-ago and 3 percent higher than the prior period. It was the 16th consecutive quarter of loan growth for the San Francisco-based bank. But with that growth has come the need to boost reserves against loan losses that are possible in the future. Wells’ provisions for loan losses of $1.1 billion more than tripled from the year-ago quarter, and were 49-percent higher than the first quarter. The bank said its overall credit quality was “solid,” with the exception of its oil and gas portfolio, which has come under pressure due to the decline in energy prices. Wells Fargo is the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, but faced some particular challenges in that business. Its mortgage banking revenue fell 17 percent even amid a wave of new business. The decline came from its mortgage-servicing portfolio, where hedges on the direction of interest rates were less effective, and where the bank also faced higher costs. Up to Thursday’s close, Wells Fargo’s stock had dropped about 10 percent since the start of the year, but it remained the most highly valued U.S. bank. Although Wells’ results were generally in line with expectations, Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski said they were “an indication of how difficult revenue growth is to come by.” ",7152016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wellsfargo-results/wells-fargo-management-prodded-on-expenses-after-profit-decline-idUSKCN0ZV1G2

1400,WFC,Wells Fargo to roll out pilot robo adviser in first half of 2017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s wealth management business plans to roll out a pilot version of a robo adviser service during the first half of 2017, a spokeswoman said on Wednesday. Robo advisers are computer software programs that manage client money using algorithms and computer-generated portfolios rather than traditional human brokers. They are popular with investors who want to pay lower fees or prefer digital options. Wells Fargo Advisors spokeswoman Rachelle Rowe said the bank has not decided whether it will build the technology in-house or partner with a third-party robo adviser. But, she said, Wells aims to have a pilot version available for a small number of clients around the end of the first quarter next year. Reuters reported in May that the bank would announce an investment and strategic partnership tied to a robo adviser product for its clients in the second quarter, which ended in June. Rowe said she could not provide a timeline on when a model for the service would be announced. Wells Fargo released a study on Wednesday that showed less than half of investors have heard of the term robo adviser, and just 5 percent have used one.

1402,WFC,Amazon enters student loan business in partnership with Wells Fargo,"(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is entering the student loan business in a partnership with Wells Fargo & Co, offering cheaper rates for loans to Amazon customers who pay for a “Prime Student” subscription.    The deal calls for Wells Fargo to shave half a percentage point from its interest rate on student loans to Amazon “Prime Student” customers, who also get benefits such as free two-day shipping and access to movies, television shows and photo storage. “Amazon’s looking for increased membership in Student Prime. That’s what they want out of this deal,” John Rasmussen, head of Wells Fargo’s Personal Lending Group, said in an interview. “What we’re looking for is exposure to our products and services and awareness. That’s the extent of the relationship.” An Amazon spokeswoman sent a brief statement but did not respond to questions about its strategy or the terms of the deal. Wells Fargo charges between 3.39 percent and 9.03 percent for a variable-rate student loan, and from 5.94 percent to 10.93 percent for a fixed-rate loan, according to rates listed on its website Thursday.  A borrower who would ordinarily qualify for a 3.39 percent rate would be able to get a 2.89 percent rate by paying for a Prime Student subscription, a bank spokesman confirmed. Amazon agreed not to work with other student lenders in similar deals, though Wells Fargo would be able to offer similar incentives to customers of Amazon competitors, Rasmussen said. Rasmussen said Wells Fargo does not compensate Amazon as part of the deal, nor does Amazon receive any compensation from Wells Fargo. The third-largest U.S. bank by assets, Wells Fargo had $12.2 billion in student loans outstanding at the end of 2015, compared with $11.9 billion at the end of 2014. One of the largest private student lenders, the bank sold substantially all of its government guaranteed student loan portfolio in 2014. While government loans tend to have high default rates, lenders are attracted to the private side of the business because they can offer better pricing to more creditworthy borrowers, Citizens Financial Group Inc Chief Executive Bruce Van Saun said in an interview Thursday.

1407,WFC,Big U.S. brokerages chase the rich in departure from retail roots,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big U.S. brokerages are redefining the term “wealthy” in their pursuit of ever-richer clients to prop up margins eroded by historically low interest rates and growing regulatory burdens. Brokerages owned by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co have been using new incentives and penalties to push financial advisers to bring in more multi-millionaires and whittle down smaller accounts. Clients with less than $750,000 are now considered “mass affluent,” meaning they may not get the same service as top customers because their financial needs are simpler, said Kendra Thompson, who heads the wealth and asset management division of consulting firm Accenture. Industry sources say that figure was closer to $250,000 before the financial crisis. In a departure from their decades-long commitment to all investors, brokerages are increasingly referring customers with as much as a couple hundred thousand dollars to call centers and digital advice platforms, executives and advisers say. Rich investors not only have more assets to manage. They can also bring additional business such as estate planning or lending against fine art, they say. Serving those clients “used to be about prestige, now it’s about margins,” said Jane Swan, a managing director who focuses on the wealth management industry at recruiting firm Sheffield Haworth. The gradual shift toward clients with millions rather than hundreds of thousands to invest has accelerated in recent months, in part because of new rules on financial advisory services, executives, advisers and industry consultants say. “All of these firms are mid-step in major transformations,” said Accenture’s Thompson. Announced in April and due to be phased in by 2018, the Labor Department’s fiduciary rule will explicitly require advisers to act in clients’ “best interest.” The current standard obliges them to offer products that are “suitable.”  Industry groups are pushing back, arguing the new rule brings disclosure requirements, paperwork, product restrictions and legal liabilities that will make small accounts unprofitable. In the meantime, brokerages are getting ready for its implementation, in part by shifting their business up the wealth scale.  “Somebody with $32,000 to invest does not need a Morgan Stanley financial adviser to help them do it,” the bank’s chief executive, James Gorman, told a conference last month. Morgan Stanley’s wealth business has grown assets from households with over $10 million to invest by 88 percent since 2009, Gorman said at a financial services conference in June, describing millionaire clients as a “sweet spot” in the bank’s business. While overall client assets under Morgan Stanley’s management rose $515 billion since 2009, those coming from households with less than $100,000 fell by 27 percent. The firm has reduced financial advisers’ commissions for clients under that threshold, encouraging brokers to send them to a call center instead. Similarly, Merrill Lynch has stopped paying brokers on accounts with less than $250,000 in assets. Wells Fargo, meanwhile, has begun offering bonuses to advisers when at least three-quarters of their clients have $250,000 or more in their accounts. Wells also recruited over 100 private bankers from Credit Suisse AG last year to bolster its high net worth business. As a result of the growing focus on wealthy clients, financial advisers are raking in more in revenue. They brought in $695,000 on average last year, up 6 percent from 2014 and 53 percent more than in 2009, according to investment data firm PriceMetrix. (GRAPHIC: tmsnrt.rs/2aji1XT) In fact, advisers at Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and UBS Group AG’s wealth management business in the Americas have already come close to or exceeded the $1 million mark for annual revenue. “Unless you have a couple hundred thousand at the branch, they don’t want to give you the time of day,” said Bryan Frank, who was once a brokerage customer but shifted his money to the digital platform Betterment in 2012. Analysts expect the trend to continue, but warn that brokerages’ pursuit of rich clientele comes with its own risks. They face fierce competition not just from their peers, but also elite private banks, putting pressure on fees.  Big brokerages must also be careful not to alienate those just below the top wealth bracket, who produce leaner margins, but represent a bigger chunk of the business, analysts say. If neglected, customers like Frank can drift to digital platforms, or robo advisers, such as Betterment or Wealthfront, which use algorithms and have low fees and tiny account minimums. Most big brokerages are developing their own robo platforms, or planning to partner with one. Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, UBS and Wells Fargo also have call centers that can serve small clients, hoping it will help keep them while allowing advisers to focus on big accounts. “People with certain levels of wealth have issues that are very distinct,” said Brad DeHond, a Morgan Stanley financial adviser in Chicago who focuses on clients with more than $20 million in assets. “It isn’t a matter of just having some extra zeroes at the end of their statements.” ",7292016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-wealth/big-u-s-brokerages-chase-the-rich-in-departure-from-retail-roots-idUSKCN1090DA

1411,WFC,Wells Fargo Advisors names David Kowach new head,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Company named David Kowach to head its retail wealth management division, Wells Fargo Advisors, the nation’s third-largest brokerage, on Thursday. Kowach was promoted from his job overseeing roughly 11,000 brokers in the bank’s Private Client Group. He succeeds Mary Mack, who left Wells Fargo Advisors last month to head up Wells’ community banking business. Kowach, a 25-year veteran of the financial services industry, was focused on recruitment, retention, growth and sales during the more than four years he led the Private Client Group, Wells Fargo’s largest wealth management business. In his new role, he will takes on managing an additional 4,000 bankers under the Wells Fargo Advisors umbrella. Kowach enters the role at a time when the full-service brokerage industry is undergoing major regulatory and technology changes. A new Department of Labor rule that takes effect in April 2017 has sparked an industry overhaul as wealth management businesses big and small scramble to decipher which products and business practices meet the rule’s fiduciary standard. The cost of compliance industry-wide is expected to reach as much as $31.5 billion in the next decade, which will result in higher costs to serve mass affluent investors who make up a large portion of the St. Louis-based brokerage’s clientele. Wells Fargo Advisors is working to roll out a pilot version of a robo adviser in first half of 2017 in order to have more options for clients who want to pay lower fees or prefer digital options. Wells also made a play last year to target wealthier clients by recruiting more than 100 private bankers from Credit Suisse Group AG when the Swiss bank sold off its U.S.-based brokerage business, many of whom took jobs in Kowach’s old division. Wells Fargo, which said it would name Kowach’s successor shortly, did not make him available for interviews.

1414,WFC,Wells Fargo to pay $4.1 mln to settle charges of illegal student loan practices,"(Reuters) - A Wells Fargo & Co unit will pay $4.1 million to settle allegations that it engaged in illegal private student loan servicing practices that unfairly penalized certain borrowers, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) said on Monday. The bureau said it identified breakdowns throughout Wells Fargo’s servicing process, including failing to provide important payment information to consumers, charging illegal fees and failing to update inaccurate credit report information. Wells neither admitted nor denied the charges, the bureau said. The settlement resolves three areas of concern related to “procedures that were retired or improved many years ago, and addresses the impact to a small number of customers,” a Wells Fargo spokesman said. The procedures at issue were either retired or corrected between 2011 and 2013. The $4.1 million sum includes a $3.6 million penalty to the bureau and a $410,000 fund for borrowers. Last year, the CFPB found that more than 8 million U.S. borrowers are in default on more than $110 billion in student loans. Breakdowns in student loan servicing may be driving the problem, the bureau said. Student loans make up the second largest U.S. consumer debt market with roughly $1.3 trillion owed by borrowers who took out federal and private loans, the bureau said. Loans from private lenders are a small fraction of that amount, totaling about $100 billion owed. But they are often used by borrowers with high debt levels who also have federal loans, the CFPB said. The bureau said the bank processed payments in a way that made consumers pay more fees. If a borrower’s payment was not enough to cover the total amount due for all loans in an account, the bank divided that payment among the loans in a way that maximized late fees rather than satisfying payments for some of the loans, the bureau said. Wells Fargo’s Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based education finance unit services about 1.3 million U.S. consumers, the CFPB said.",8222016,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-loans-fine/wells-fargo-to-pay-4-1-mln-to-settle-charges-of-illegal-student-loan-practices-idUSL1N1B31B6

1418,WFC,Wells Fargo to pay homeowners $3.45 mln over mailing error,"(Reuters) - A Wells Fargo & Co mortgage unit will pay $3.45 million to some customers because of a processing error that delayed the mailing of letters to almost 8,000 homeowners in bankruptcy and shortened their notice period about changes to monthly mortgage payment amounts, according to a court document. The unit, called Wells Fargo Bank NA, agreed on the sum in a pact with the Department of Justice’s U.S. Trustee Program, which oversees the country’s bankruptcy system, according to a letter from the bank filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Greenbelt, Maryland.

Inquiries by an independent compliance monitor hired by the bank as part of an $81.6 million settlement with the Justice Department last year uncovered the problem, said Cliff White, director of the U.S. Trustee Program’s executive office, in a statement. In that agreement last year, Wells Fargo settled claims that it denied thousands of homeowners a chance to challenge mortgage payment increases imposed during their bankruptcy proceedings. The latest $3.45 million deal reached with Wells Fargo supplements that settlement, the U.S. Trustee Program said. The bank also has agreed to expanded compliance monitoring.

1422,WFC,Credit Suisse chairman calls for time to complete turnaround,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner aims to stay in office beyond 2018, he told German newspaper Handelsblatt, confident that his and Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam’s strategy will revive the struggling Swiss bank. Shares in Credit Suisse closed on Tuesday at 12.53 Swiss francs, lingering near record lows amid tough financial markets and concerns over the bank’s capital position. But the surprise second-quarter profit announced last month provided a lift for management’s push to move Switzerland’s second-biggest bank away from volatile, capital-intensive investment banking and focus on wealth management.  “We have developed a common strategy with plenty of thought and we are convinced it is the right one,” Rohner told Handelsblatt. “And our big investors are behind our alignment.” Challenges remain, however, and the bank has lost a number of senior staff this year, including global chairman of M&A; David DeNunzio, who joined Wells Fargo & Co, and a group of five investment bankers who left for Jefferies Group in May. Rohner, whose post is renewed annually, also told the newspaper that the continued independence of some large European banks may hinge on finding others to manage centralized services, such as customer account data.   “I can imagine that a third party could do that for a series of banks,” he said. “If multiple banks would join up, the resulting IT infrastructure organization could be sold in an IPO on the stock exchange.” Rohner’s comments echoed the thought processes of other Swiss bankers, including UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti, who recently said he thinks the industry may need to form such alliances to share economies of scale and lower costs.

1427,WFC,UPDATE 2-Wells Fargo will pay $190 mln to settle customer fraud case,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo has long been the envy of the banking industry for its ability to sell multiple products to the same customer, but regulators on Thursday said those practices went too far in some instances. The largest U.S. bank by market capitalization will pay $185 million in penalties and $5 million to customers that regulators say were pushed into fee-generating accounts they never requested. “We regret and take responsibility for any instances where customers may have received a product that they did not request,” the bank said of a settlement reached Thursday with California prosecutors and federal regulators. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will receive $100 million of the total penalties - the largest fine ever levied by the federal agency. “Today’s action should serve notice to the entire industry that financial incentive programs, if not monitored carefully, carry serious risks that can have serious legal consequences,” said CFPB Director Richard Cordray. Los Angeles officials and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency were also party to the settlement. In a complaint filed in May 2015, California prosecutors alleged that Wells Fargo pushed customers into costly financial products that they did not need or even request. Bank employees were told that the average customer tapped six financial tools but that they should push households to use eight products, according to the complaint. The bank opened more than 2 million deposit and credit card accounts that may not have been authorized, the CFPB said Thursday. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Mary Eshet said the bank fired 5,300 employees over “inappropriate sales conduct.” The firings took place over a five-year period, Eshet said, adding that the bank has 100,000 employees in its branches. Wells Fargo regularly releases numbers about how many products it sells to customers, a practice it calls “cross-sell.” Its wealth and investment management unit, for example, sold 10.55 products per retail banking household in November 2015, up from 10.49 a year earlier, according to the bank’s annual 10-K financial filing. In the second quarter, however, the bank changed how it tallies up some of those numbers and said it was considering more changes. Piper Jaffray analyst Kevin Barker said he does not think the crackdown on Wells Fargo will have much of an impact on others in the industry. “I think this is unique to Wells Fargo and their particular situation and how hard they push on cross-sell,” he said.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will receive $100 million of the total penalties - the largest fine ever levied by the agency, which was conceived after the 2008 financial crisis. “Today’s action should serve notice to the entire industry that financial incentive programs, if not monitored carefully, carry serious risks that can have serious legal consequences,” said CFPB Director Richard Cordray. Los Angeles officials and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency were also party to the settlement. In a complaint filed in May 2015, California prosecutors alleged that Wells Fargo pushed customers into costly financial products that they did not need or even request. According to that complaint, Wells Fargo employees pushed checking account customers into savings, credit and online accounts that could generate fees. Bank employees were told that the average customer tapped six financial tools but that they should push households to use eight products, according to the complaint. The bank opened more than 2 million deposit and credit card accounts that may not have been authorized, according to the CFPB. The bank said that the deal this week settles the “allegations that some of its retail customers received products and services that they did not request.” In recent financial filings, Wells Fargo has changed how it describes and calculates “cross-sell” - a term for bundling multiple products to retail, wealth management and corporate customers. The bank added new language to its last annual report, stating that its “approach to cross-sell is needs-based as some customers will benefit from more products, and some may need fewer.”",9082016,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-settlement/wells-fargo-will-pay-190-mln-to-settle-customer-fraud-case-idUSL1N1BK1E8

1436,WFC,Wells Fargo seeks to shore up reputation in wake of scandal,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co scrapped its product sales goals for retail bankers on Tuesday and may take further disciplinary action against its employees in the wake of a fake account scandal that has already led to $190 million in fines and the firing of 5,300 employees. Wells Fargo has been hit hard by allegations its staff opened more than 2 million bank accounts and credit cards for customers without their consent in a bid to meet internal sales goals.  Politicians are calling for an investigation, and Wells Fargo and regulators are expected to testify in the Senate next week. One of the United States’ largest and most respected financial institutions, Wells Fargo built itself into the most valuable U.S. bank after the financial crisis partly because it did not rely on risky trades or complex derivatives to turn a profit.  But the company’s shares have lost around 7 percent of their value since last week, when U.S. regulators unveiled the fines against the bank , and it has ceded its position as the largest U.S. bank by market capitalization to rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. Wells Fargo - which was long the envy of the banking industry for its ability to sell multiple products to the same customer - agreed to pay $185 million in fines and $5 million to customers last week after reaching a settlement with three regulators over the alleged sales abuses. The phantom accounts meant that some customers were charged for insufficient funds, according to the regulators. During a CNBC appearance on Tuesday evening, Chief Executive John Stumpf apologized and said management takes responsibility for the problems identified in the settlement. Although the bank has eliminated sales goals for retail staff, Stumpf said “cross-selling” products from various businesses to customers is still important to growing its business. “We still love-cross selling,” he said, later adding, “Cross-sell is shorthand for deep, long-term relationships. We love that.” Even after firing more than 2 percent of its staff for improper selling, Wells Fargo is still examining its practices, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said earlier in the day. The bank will “take a big wide fresh look at who knew what and when and what else might have been done,” he said speaking at an industry conference. Shrewsberry said the review would impact people “at all levels of the organization.” Carrie Tolstedt, the head of the bank’s retail operations where the abuses are alleged to have occurred, stepped down in July. The controversy has led to calls for the bank to claw back bonuses paid to her. Tolstedt received a pay raise in March, after getting more than $9 million in cash and stock last year. She left with more than 2.5 million in Wells Fargo shares, currently worth around $120 million. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said Tolstedt had “made a decision to retire at the end of this year.” Tolstedt could not be reached for comment. Stumpf said clawback decisions are determined by the board of directors, and that product sales goals are not a component of compensation for any senior executives. The bank’s practices have also drawn scrutiny from Washington, with staff members for the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the banking industry, set to meet with representatives of the bank. Stumpf, Cordray and Tom Curry, from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, will testify before the committee next week. Torrie Matous, spokeswoman for the committee’s chairman, Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, said staff had “been arranging briefings and collecting information from both Wells Fargo and the regulators” to prepare for a Sept. 20 hearing.  Five Democrats on the committee, including Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have pressed for an investigation. The top Democrat on the banking committee, Ohio’s Senator Sherrod Brown, wants the panel to probe deeper than a single hearing, “so we can get answers on how this massive fraud happened, what’s being done to make customers whole, and how to put safeguards in place to protect against its recurrence.” ",9132016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-wells-fargo/wells-fargo-seeks-to-shore-up-reputation-in-wake-of-scandal-idUSKCN11J2PZ

He said the bank will “take a big wide fresh look at who knew what and when and what else might have been done.” Shrewsberry said the review would impact people “at all levels of the organization.” Last week, Wells Fargo paid $185 million in fines and $5 million to customers after reaching a settlement with three regulators over sales abuses as employees opened sham credit card, debit card and other accounts to meet aggressive sales targets. The phantom accounts resulted in some customers being hit with fees for insufficient funds. The incident has also brought attention to the compensation of Carrie Tolstedt, who stepped down as head of the bank’s Community Banking unit in July. According to the bank’s 2015 proxy, Tolstedt received more than $9 million in cash and stock in 2015, and she has more than 2.5 million in Wells Fargo shares which would be worth about $120 million at Tuesday’s prices. Wells Fargo announced Tuesday it would eliminate product sales goals for retail bankers, one of several recent measures it has taken to try and get in front of a gathering public storm over the sales scandal. In a interview with CNBC Tuesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said the enforcement action highlighted “bad behavior” by Wells Fargo, adding “how that flows through in terms of next consequences is going to depend on the facts of the case.” A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on Lew’s remarks.

The issue has also attracted the attention of U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hilary Clinton, and at least seven U.S. Senators have signed letters calling for an investigation. Shrewsberry said 10 percent of the 5,300 employees who were fired were managers, including store managers. He said roughly two thirds of the employees disciplined were in the Southwestern U.S., and they were largely “people trying to meet minimum goals to hang onto their job.” Shrewsberry said the bank increased staffing to prepare for the fallout over the regulatory settlement, but has so far seen “very very low volumes of customer reaction.” ",9132016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-conference-wells-fargo/wells-fargo-may-take-more-disciplinary-action-over-sales-abuses-idUSKCN11J1LC

He said the bank will “take a big wide fresh look at who knew what and when and what else might have been done.” Shrewsberry said the review would impact people “at all levels of the organization.” Last week, Wells Fargo paid $185 million in fines and $5 million to customers after reaching a settlement with three regulators over sales abuses as employees opened sham credit card, debit card and other accounts to meet aggressive sales targets. The phantom accounts resulted in some customers being hit with fees for insufficient funds. The incident has also brought attention to the compensation of Carrie Tolstedt, who stepped down as head of the bank’s Community Banking unit in July. According to the bank’s 2015 proxy, Tolstedt received more than $9 million in cash and stock in 2015, and she has more than 2.5 million in Wells Fargo shares which would be worth about $120 million at Tuesday’s prices. Wells Fargo announced Tuesday it would eliminate product sales goals for retail bankers, one of several recent measures it has taken to try and get in front of a gathering public storm over the sales scandal.

1447,WFC,Activist says Wells Fargo to face tough shareholder resolutions,"BOSTON (Reuters) - An activist investor said on Wednesday it is “inevitable” that Wells Fargo & Co will face critical shareholder resolutions after the bank agreed to a $190 million settlement with regulators over fake consumer accounts. Tim Smith, who leads shareholder engagement efforts at Walden Asset Management in Boston, said his firm is talking with investors including state pension funds and labor groups about submitting resolutions for the bank’s springtime shareholder meeting that may call for things like clawing back executive pay or requiring the company to report on its governance procedures. The largest U.S. bank by market capitalization last week said it would pay $185 million in penalties and $5 million to customers that regulators say were pushed into fee-generating accounts they never requested. “It’s  inevitable that Wells Fargo will face  a series of critical shareholder resolutions in light of this scandal,” Smith said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. A Wells Fargo spokesman declined to comment. Federal prosecutors are in the early stages of an investigation into sales practices at Wells Fargo, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Shareholder resolutions could be a black eye for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, which has avoided some of the investor backlash that other large banks faced coming out of the financial crisis under pressure from Walden and other activists. JPMorgan Chase & Co for instance agreed to publish a report in 2014 outlining improved controls it put in place  including pay clawbacks and minimum share ownership requirements for leaders. Also, in 2015 pension funds including the California Public Employees’ Retirement System challenged Bank of America to split the dual roles of its chair and CEO Brian Moynihan, though their efforts failed. Smith said a move to split the dual roles of Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf is also a possibility. A vote in April to require an independent chairman at Wells Fargo drew support from only 17 percent of votes cast. Asked about Wells Fargo’s recent settlement, Calpers spokeswoman Megan White said via e-mail the system “will be reviewing the issue in our proxy vote” and declined further comment. Sanjay Sen, chief investment officer of BloombergSen Investment Partners in Toronto, which has about 2.3 million Wells Fargo shares, said via e-mail that his firm would support any resolution that improves Wells Fargo’s management or corporate culture.

1453,WFC,Wells Fargo seeks to shore up reputation in wake of scandal,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co  scrapped its product sales goals for retail bankers on Tuesday and may take further disciplinary action against its employees in the wake of a fake account scandal that has already led to $190 million in fines and the firing of 5,300 employees. Wells Fargo has been hit hard by allegations its staff opened more than 2 million bank accounts and credit cards for customers without their consent in a bid to meet internal sales goals. Politicians are calling for an investigation, and Wells Fargo and regulators are expected to testify in the Senate next week. One of the United States’ largest and most respected financial institutions, Wells Fargo built itself into the most valuable U.S. bank after the financial crisis partly because it did not rely on risky trades or complex derivatives to turn a profit. But the company’s shares have lost around 7 percent of their value since last week, when U.S. regulators unveiled the fines against the bank , and it has ceded its position as the largest U.S. bank by market capitalization to rival JPMorgan Chase & Co . Wells Fargo - which was long the envy of the banking industry for its ability to sell multiple products to the same customer - agreed to pay $185 million in fines and $5 million to customers last week after reaching a settlement with three regulators over the alleged sales abuses. The phantom accounts meant that some customers were charged for insufficient funds, according to the regulators. During a CNBC appearance on Tuesday evening, Chief Executive John Stumpf apologized and said management takes responsibility for the problems identified in the settlement. Although the bank has eliminated sales goals for retail staff, Stumpf said “cross-selling” products from various businesses to customers is still important to growing its business. “We still love-cross selling,” he said, later adding, “Cross-sell is shorthand for deep, long-term relationships. We love that.” Even after firing more than 2 percent of its staff for improper selling, Wells Fargo is still examining its practices, Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said earlier in the day. The bank will “take a big wide fresh look at who knew what and when and what else might have been done,” he said speaking at an industry conference. Shrewsberry said the review would impact people “at all levels of the organization.” Carrie Tolstedt, the head of the bank’s retail operations where the abuses are alleged to have occurred, stepped down in July. The controversy has led to calls for the bank to claw back bonuses paid to her. Tolstedt received a pay raise in March, after getting more than $9 million in cash and stock last year. She left with more than 2.5 million in Wells Fargo shares, currently worth around $120 million. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman said Tolstedt had “made a decision to retire at the end of this year.” Tolstedt could not be reached for comment. Stumpf said clawback decisions are determined by the board of directors, and that product sales goals are not a component of compensation for any senior executives. The bank’s practices have also drawn scrutiny from Washington, with staff members for the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the banking industry, set to meet with representatives of the bank. Stumpf, Cordray and Tom Curry, from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, will testify before the committee next week. Torrie Matous, spokeswoman for the committee’s chairman, Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, said staff had “been arranging briefings and collecting information from both Wells Fargo and the regulators” to prepare for a Sept. 20 hearing. Five Democrats on the committee, including Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have pressed for an investigation. The top Democrat on the banking committee, Ohio’s Senator Sherrod Brown, wants the panel to probe deeper than a single hearing, “so we can get answers on how this massive fraud happened, what’s being done to make customers whole, and how to put safeguards in place to protect against its recurrence.”",9142016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-banks-wells-fargo/wells-fargo-seeks-to-shore-up-reputation-in-wake-of-scandal-idUSL2N1BQ0IA

1460,WFC,Wells Fargo faces proposed class action over bogus accounts,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co, embroiled in a scandal over the opening of sham accounts, was sued on Friday by customers who accused the bank of fraud and recklessness for its behavior. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court in Utah, and seeks class-action status on behalf of hundreds of thousands of customers nationwide. Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Last week, the San Francisco-based lender agreed to pay $190 million to settle regulatory charges that employees opened some 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge, in order to meet sales targets. Wells Fargo, the country’s third-largest bank by assets, has said it has fired 5,300 people over the matter and would eliminate sales goals in its retail banking on Jan. 1, 2017.

1466,WFC,Top U.S. bank regulator says Wells Fargo case shows sales risks,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Reuters) - The U.S. Comptroller of the Currency said a recent case against Wells Fargo & Co  concerning phantom accounts highlights the risks other banks face in their efforts to sell new products to existing customers. The comptroller, Thomas Curry, said on Thursday that other banks should review what risks may arise from efforts to “cross-sell” to existing customers, which he called a common strategy. “We expect banks to assess and to mitigate those risks in advance and on an ongoing basis,” said Curry, speaking to Reuters after giving a speech at Harvard University. The agency will consider the case of Wells Fargo in its regular safety and soundness exams of other banks, he said. Curry’s office, which oversees national banks, was among the regulators with whom San Francisco-based Wells Fargo reached a $190 million settlement last week over claims it created roughly two million accounts that customers did not want. Curry said the Wells Fargo case boiled down to a matter of internal controls. “Banks need to adhere to the highest standards. This is a culture issue. You cannot as a bank abuse your customers’ trust,” he said at one point during his presentation. In his remarks, Curry also defended capital requirements and other standards for banks and said they have made the institutions more competitive coming out of the last decade’s financial crisis. He said it would be a poor time to relax rules, as some have suggested as a way to encourage economic growth. “Now is not the time to change course,” Curry said. He cited improvements to bank balance sheets such that Tier 1 common equity is now about 13 percent of risk-weighted assets, up from 9 percent in late 2008, while the leverage ratio is now at 9.3 percent, about a third higher than in 2008. “The high standards here in the U.S. have made our banks stronger in absolute terms and in comparative terms” against foreign banks, Curry said. In August, the Bank of England eased a broad measure of capital adequacy for banks to help avoid crimping the flow of credit after the vote in June to leave the European Union.

1477,WFC,Morgan Stanley says Wells Fargo stock inexpensive; raises rating,"(Reuters) - The recent decline in Wells Fargo & Co’s (WFC.N) share price after the bank agreed to settle a fraud case with regulators makes the stock an attractive buy, Morgan Stanley said, raising its rating to “overweight.” The upgrade comes on a day when Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf is testifying before the Senate banking committee in connection with the case. Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185 million in fines earlier this month, after reaching a settlement with three regulators over sales abuses as employees opened sham credit card, debit card and other accounts to meet aggressive sales targets. “Wells is rarely this inexpensive. This is an opportunity,” Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a note to clients. Wells Fargo’s shares have fallen about 8 percent since the company disclosed the settlement on Sept. 8. Morgan Stanley said it does not see a risk to Wells Fargo’s dividends as the U.S. Federal Reserve has not objected to the bank’s 2016 capital plan and as the fine does not materially impact its earnings. “Wells stock should begin to find a bottom as the House and Senate hearings conclude,” wrote Graseck, who is rated three stars out of five for his recommendation on the stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. Morgan Stanley, which sees a 15 percent upside to its current price target of $53, also cut Wells Fargo’s 2017 earnings per share estimate by 3 percent to $4.10 as it expects deposit service charges and credit card fees to grow slower.

1479,WFC,Clinton tells Wells Fargo customers CEO owes them an explanation,"WASHINGTON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took on the Wells Fargo & Co  bogus-accounts case in a letter to the bank’s customers to be released on Tuesday, when Wells Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf will testify before a Senate committee. Clinton, who faced accusations during her party’s primary elections of representing Wall Street’s interests, said in the letter that Stumpf “owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch.” Earlier this month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators announced a $185 million settlement with the bank for creating 2 million phantom accounts under actual customers’ names in a bid to meet internal sales goals. In the letter sent to customers, Clinton laid out a three-prong plan to address what she called “the culture of misconduct and recklessness” in the banking system. It included “clawing back” the compensation of individual executives involved in wrongdoing and breaking up big banks that are not managed effectively. She also called for maintaining the CFPB, an agency created in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that Republican lawmakers would like to reorganize.

1482,WFC,Heat rises on Wells Fargo CEO after lawmaker grilling,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co Chief Executive John Stumpf prides himself on being a banker who understands the little guy’s financial problems. He has spoken publicly about growing up poor on a Minnesota farm, starting his career as a low-level repo man and being underwater on his own mortgage years ago. But when called before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday to answer questions about a scandal at his bank involving 2 million fake accounts that thousands of employees set up in customers’ names, Stumpf’s answers fell flat. The white-haired, 63-year-old CEO repeatedly told a congressional panel that he had to check with staff, lacked information or was not an “expert” on a range of topics including executive compensation, credit scores and contracts that must be signed to open an account. Throughout the hearing, Stumpf was polite, responding to senators’ often aggressive questions with a calm, earthy twang. His hand was bandaged and in a splint after “roughhousing” with his grandkids, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn said. “He talks about the team, he talks about the good people ... He smiles, and he’s sweet and he’s in no way responsible,” said Robert Monks, chairman of ValueEdge Advisors, which advises investors on corporate governance issues. “His response to questions remind me of Muhammad Ali’s rope a dope defense - he gets up against the ropes, he puts up his hands.” Earlier this month, the lender agreed to pay $190 million in penalties and customer payouts to settle the case involving the creation of credit, savings and other accounts without customers’ knowledge. About $5 million will directly go to customers, many of whom might have paid a small fee on the unwanted accounts. His responses gave plenty of ammunition to critics who point to the scandal as the latest example that some banks are still too big to manage and executives should serve jail time. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts who frequently lambasts the financial industry, said the only appropriate response to the scandal would be for Stumpf to resign, give back his pay and be criminally investigated. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton penned an open letter arguing for greater accountability. Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk declined to comment on Stumpf’s testimony. Pressure has been building beyond Capitol Hill for Stumpf and Wells Fargo’s board of directors to come up with better answers. Activist investors including the Needmor Fund and Public Citizen’s Bart Naylor have filed motions to split the roles of chairman and CEO on Wells Fargo’s proxy and examine whether the bank should be broken up. The Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation also have launched probes into the bank’s actions following Wells’ settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Los Angeles city attorney. Wells Fargo has mostly sought to minimize the problem since its settlement was announced on Sept. 8. Executives have pointed out that while thousands of employees set up accounts without customers’ authorization over five years, they represent a tiny fraction of total staff. Wells Fargo did not consider the matter to be financially “material,” Stumpf told Congress on Tuesday, even though it involved $2.6 million worth of inappropriate fees charged to consumers and resulted in the bank paying $190 million worth of penalties. Stumpf said he takes responsibility for the problems, and  detailed additional steps the bank is taking to address them. He is not the first Wall Street CEO to have his day before an angry congressional panel and live to tell about it. Goldman Sachs Group Inc executives, including CEO Lloyd Blankfein, were grilled by lawmakers in April 2010 over a derivative trade that helped the bank profit from the mortgage market’s implosion. In 2011, former MF Global CEO Jon Corzine had to explain how his collapsed firm managed to lose more than $1 billion in customer funds. And in 2012, JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon had to answer for the so-called “London Whale,” a wrong-way derivative bet that lost the bank billions of dollars. But Wells Fargo’s problem may be resonating more because it involves regular bank accounts for regular people who faced unjustified fees, rather than arcane derivatives traded by sophisticated investors. But even if the scandal is more palpable on Main Street, analysts and investors who spoke to Reuters after Stumpf’s testimony said it may ultimately matter little to Wells Fargo’s bottom line or share price. Its biggest investor, Warren Buffett, has declined to comment on the matter. The bank turned a $23-billion profit last year and until recently was the most highly-valued bank in the United States. Even analysts who were critical of Wells’ response to the scandal characterized its recent stock decline as a buying opportunity. “It’s not very good publicity for Wells but I think they’ll get through it,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. “It’s a cheap stock.” ",9212016,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-accounts-ceo/heat-rises-on-wells-fargo-ceo-after-lawmaker-grilling-idUSL2N1BX171

1484,WFC,Heat rises on Wells Fargo CEO after lawmaker grilling,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co Chief Executive John Stumpf prides himself on being a banker who understands the little guy’s financial problems. He has spoken publicly about growing up poor on a Minnesota farm, starting his career as a low-level repo man and being underwater on his own mortgage years ago. But when called before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday to answer questions about a scandal at his bank involving 2 million fake accounts that thousands of employees set up in customers’ names, Stumpf’s answers fell flat.  The white-haired, 63-year-old CEO repeatedly told a congressional panel that he had to check with staff, lacked information or was not an “expert” on a range of topics including executive compensation, credit scores and contracts that must be signed to open an account. Throughout the hearing, Stumpf was polite, responding to senators’ often aggressive questions with a calm, earthy twang. His hand was bandaged and in a splint after “roughhousing” with his grandkids, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Jennifer Dunn said. “He talks about the team, he talks about the good people ... He smiles, and he’s sweet and he’s in no way responsible,” said Robert Monks, chairman of ValueEdge Advisors, which advises investors on corporate governance issues. “His response to questions remind me of Muhammad Ali’s rope a dope defense – he gets up against the ropes, he puts up his hands.” Earlier this month, the lender agreed to pay $190 million in penalties and customer payouts to settle the case involving the creation of credit, savings and other accounts without customers’ knowledge. About $5 million will directly go to customers, many of whom might have paid a small fee on the unwanted accounts. His responses gave plenty of ammunition to critics who point to the scandal as the latest example that some banks are still too big to manage and executives should serve jail time. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts who frequently lambasts the financial industry, said the only appropriate response to the scandal would be for Stumpf to resign, give back his pay and be criminally investigated. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton penned an open letter arguing for greater accountability. Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk declined to comment on Stumpf’s testimony. Pressure has been building beyond Capitol Hill for Stumpf and Wells Fargo’s board of directors to come up with better answers. Activist investors including the Needmor Fund and Public Citizen’s Bart Naylor have filed motions to split the roles of chairman and CEO on Wells Fargo’s proxy and examine whether the bank should be broken up. The Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation also have launched probes into the bank’s actions following Wells’ settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Los Angeles city attorney. Wells Fargo has mostly sought to minimize the problem since its settlement was announced on Sept. 8. Executives have pointed out that while thousands of employees set up accounts without customers’ authorization over five years, they represent a tiny fraction of total staff.  Wells Fargo did not consider the matter to be financially “material,” Stumpf told Congress on Tuesday, even though it involved $2.6 million worth of inappropriate fees charged to consumers and resulted in the bank paying $190 million worth of penalties. Stumpf said he takes responsibility for the problems, and  detailed additional steps the bank is taking to address them. He is not the first Wall Street CEO to have his day before an angry congressional panel and live to tell about it. Goldman Sachs Group Inc executives, including CEO Lloyd Blankfein, were grilled by lawmakers in April 2010 over a derivative trade that helped the bank profit from the mortgage market’s implosion. In 2011, former MF Global CEO Jon Corzine had to explain how his collapsed firm managed to lose more than $1 billion in customer funds.  And in 2012, JPMorgan Chase & Co CEO Jamie Dimon had to answer for the so-called “London Whale,” a wrong-way derivative bet that lost the bank billions of dollars.

1485,WFC,Clinton tells Wells Fargo customers CEO owes them an explanation,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took on the Wells Fargo & Co bogus-accounts case in a letter to the bank’s customers to be released on Tuesday, when Wells Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf will testify before a Senate committee. Clinton, who faced accusations during her party’s primary elections of representing Wall Street’s interests, said in the letter that Stumpf “owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch.”  Earlier this month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators announced a $185 million settlement with the bank for creating 2 million phantom accounts under actual customers’ names in a bid to meet internal sales goals. In the letter sent to customers, Clinton laid out a three-prong plan to address what she called “the culture of misconduct and recklessness” in the banking system. It included “clawing back” the compensation of individual executives involved in wrongdoing and breaking up big banks that are not managed effectively. She also called for maintaining the CFPB, an agency created in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that Republican lawmakers would like to reorganize.

1487,WFC,Wells Fargo CEO resigns from San Francisco Fed's advisory council,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co Chief Executive John Stumpf, under fire over problematic sales tactics, resigned from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco’s advisory council on Thursday. “John made a personal decision to resign as the Twelfth District’s representative to the Federal Advisory Council.

1491,WFC,Senators seek Labor Department probe of Wells Fargo,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eight U.S. Democratic senators asked the Labor Department on Thursday to launch a probe into whether Wells Fargo (WFC.N) may have violated wage and working hour laws by failing to pay overtime to tellers and sales representatives who stayed late to meet sales quotas. The request comes after Wells Fargo earlier this month was ordered to pay $190 million to settle civil charges alleging its employees had set up about 2 million accounts and credit cards in customers’ names that may have not been authorized. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleged in its complaint that Wells Fargo had a system in place which financially rewarded employees for each new account opened. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo said the bank strived to make all employees “feel valued, rewarded and recognized” in an environment that includes “market competitive compensation, career-development opportunities, a broad array of benefits, and a strong offering of work-life programs.” A spokesman for the Labor Department said the department cannot discuss details of law enforcement decision-making, but that it takes “the concerns raised in the letter very seriously.” The bank is facing mounting scrutiny over the issue. Federal prosecutors have also launched a criminal investigation into the matter, a source previously told Reuters. Earlier this week, lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee grilled Wells Fargo Chief Executive John Stumpf about the accounts, with some calling on him to resign and forfeit his earnings and hold other senior executives accountable. In the letter to the Labor Department, the lawmakers expressed concerns about how the high-pressure sales culture at the bank could also give rise to violations of federal labor laws. “In the wake of the CFPB’s announcement, dozens of former and current Wells Fargo employees have come forward to describe the lengths they went to in order to meet the bank’s aggressive sales quotas,” they wrote.  “For years Wells Fargo employees have described a management culture characterized by ‘mental abuse,’ being forced to work overtime ‘for what felt like after-school detention’ during the week and on weekends, and being ‘severely chastised and embarrassed in front of 60-plus managers.’” The letter was signed by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senate Banking Ranking Minority Member Sherrod Brown, Rhode Island Senator Jack Reed, New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley, New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Hawaii Senator Mazie Hirono.

1499,WFC,Former employees file class action against Wells Fargo,"(Reuters) - Two former Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) employees have filed a class action in California seeking $2.6 billion or more for workers who tried to meet aggressive sales quotas without engaging in fraud and were later demoted, forced to resign or fired. The lawsuit on behalf of people who worked for Wells Fargo in California over the past 10 years, including current employees, focuses on those who followed the rules and were penalized for not meeting sales quotas. “Wells Fargo fired or demoted employees who failed to meet unrealistic quotas while at the same time providing promotions to employees who met these quotas by opening fraudulent accounts,” the lawsuit filed on Thursday in California Superior Court in Los Angeles County said. Wells Fargo has fired some 5,300 employees for opening as many as 2 million accounts in customers’ names without their authorization. On Sept. 8, a federal regulator and Los Angeles prosecutor announced a $190 million settlement with Wells. The revelations are a severe hit to Wells Fargo’s reputation. During the financial crisis, the bank trumpeted being a conservative bank in contrast with its rivals. A Wells Fargo spokesman on Saturday declined to comment on the lawsuit. The lawsuit accuses Wells Fargo of wrongful termination, unlawful business practices and failure to pay wages, overtime, and penalties under California law. Former employees Alexander Polonsky and Brian Zaghi allege Wells Fargo managers pressed workers to meet quotas of 10 accounts per day, required progress reports several times daily and reprimanded workers who fell short. Polonsky and Zaghi filed applications matching customer requests and were counseled, demoted and later terminated, the lawsuit said. While executives at the top benefited from the activity, the blame landed on thousands of $12-per-hour employees who tried to meet the quotas and were often required to work off the clock to do so, the lawsuit said. Employees with a conscience who tried to meet quotas without engaging in fraud were the biggest victims, losing wages, benefits and suffering anxiety, humiliation and embarrassment, the lawsuit said. Wells Fargo was aware many accounts were illegally opened, unwanted, carried a zero balance, or were simply a result of unethical business practices, the lawsuit said. “Wells Fargo knew that their unreasonable quotas were driving these unethical behaviors that were used to fraudulently increase their stock price and benefit the CEO at the expense of the low level employees,” the lawsuit said.

1504,WFC,Support for Wells Fargo CEO Stumpf 'now wavering': CLSA,"(Reuters) - CLSA analyst Mike Mayo said his support for Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) Chief Executive John Stumpf was “wavering” following problematic sales tactics that has brought him under fire from U.S. lawmakers. The bank has been facing heightened scrutiny following allegations that its employees had set up as many as 2 million accounts and credit cards in customers’ names that may have not been authorized. Mayo said his support for Stumpf was contingent upon the CEO’s ability to better explain the repercussions of the sales abuses. Last week, lawmakers on the U.S. Senate Banking Committee grilled Stumpf about the accounts, with some calling on him to resign and forfeit his earnings and hold other senior executives accountable. Shareholders have a right to know what will be done to the pay of top executives, to the composition of the board, and for impacted customers, Mayo said in a note to clients. “We believe Wells Fargo is bigger than the CEO, notwithstanding a good financial track record during his tenure, and there should be no more excuses for the lack of answers to key questions,” Mayo said. Mayo rates the stock ‘outperform’ with a price target of $57. The stock’s median price target is $51. Shares of the San Francisco, California-based lender have fallen by about 10 percent since Sept. 7, the day before the bank reached a $185-million settlement over fraud case. (Story corrects headline to fix CEO’s spelling to “Stumpf” from “Stump”. Also corrects price target to $57 from $45.74 in paragraph seven.)

1505,WFC,Former employees file class action against Wells Fargo,"(Reuters) - Two former Wells Fargo & Co employees have filed a class action in California seeking $2.6 billion or more for workers who tried to meet aggressive sales quotas without engaging in fraud and were later demoted, forced to resign or fired. The lawsuit on behalf of people who worked for Wells Fargo in California over the past 10 years, including current employees, focuses on those who followed the rules and were penalized for not meeting sales quotas. “Wells Fargo fired or demoted employees who failed to meet unrealistic quotas while at the same time providing promotions to employees who met these quotas by opening fraudulent accounts,” the lawsuit filed on Thursday in California Superior Court in Los Angeles County said. Wells Fargo has fired some 5,300 employees for opening as many as 2 million accounts in customers’ names without their authorization. On Sept. 8, a federal regulator and Los Angeles prosecutor announced a $190 million settlement with Wells. The revelations are a severe hit to Wells Fargo’s reputation. During the financial crisis, the bank trumpeted being a conservative bank in contrast with its rivals. A Wells Fargo spokesman on Saturday declined to comment on the lawsuit. The lawsuit accuses Wells Fargo of wrongful termination, unlawful business practices and failure to pay wages, overtime, and penalties under California law. Former employees Alexander Polonsky and Brian Zaghi allege Wells Fargo managers pressed workers to meet quotas of 10 accounts per day, required progress reports several times daily and reprimanded workers who fell short. Polonsky and Zaghi filed applications matching customer requests and were counseled, demoted and later terminated, the lawsuit said. While executives at the top benefited from the activity, the blame landed on thousands of $12-per-hour employees who tried to meet the quotas and were often required to work off the clock to do so, the lawsuit said. Employees with a conscience who tried to meet quotas without engaging in fraud were the biggest victims, losing wages, benefits and suffering anxiety, humiliation and embarrassment, the lawsuit said. Wells Fargo was aware many accounts were illegally opened, unwanted, carried a zero balance, or were simply a result of unethical business practices, the lawsuit said. “Wells Fargo knew that their unreasonable quotas were driving these unethical behaviors that were used to fraudulently increase their stock price and benefit the CEO at the expense of the low level employees,” the lawsuit said.",9262016,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-accounts-lawsuit/former-employees-file-class-action-against-wells-fargo-idUSL2N1C20CH

1513,WFC,Wells Fargo hit with class action lawsuit over sales practices,"(Reuters) - A shareholder class action lawsuit was filed against Wells Fargo & Co on Monday that alleged the firm misled investors about its financial performance and the success of its sales practices. Wells Fargo, the United States’ third-largest bank by assets, agreed to pay $190 million earlier this month to settle regulatory charges that some of its employees opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge, in order to meet sales targets. Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announced the lawsuit and is seeking class action status on behalf of buyers of the company’s shares between Feb. 26, 2014 and Sept. 15, 2016. The lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court of Northern California, comes nearly a week after Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf faced U.S. Senate lawmakers about his oversight at the bank. It also singled out Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt, the now-retired executive at the center of the scandal, for selling more than $31 million of their stock in Wells Fargo at “artificially inflated” prices. Wells Fargo has said its board will assess whether to cancel or claw back any incentive compensation paid to Tolstedt. The complaint also criticizes the firm’s cross-selling strategy, saying it failed to disclose material facts about its practices that were aimed at fulfilling sales quotas. Wells Fargo has long been the envy of the banking industry for its ability to sell multiple products to the same customer.

1515,WFC,U.S. Labor Department launches review of all Wells Fargo complaints,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Labor Department Secretary Thomas Perez on Monday pledged to conduct a “top-to-bottom” review of all cases, complaints and other alleged violations that the department has received concerning Wells Fargo in recent years. Perez’s announcement, outlined in a Sept. 26 letter to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, comes after Warren and other Democrats asked the Labor Department last week to launch a probe into possible wage and working-hour law violations involving Wells Fargo tellers and sales representatives who may have stayed late to meet sales quotas. “Given the serious nature of the allegations, the recent actions of our federal partners, and recent media reports, I have directed enforcement agencies within the Department to conduct a top-to-bottom review,” he wrote. He also said the department has created a web page at www.dol.gov/wellsfargo to help ensure current and former Wells Fargo employees are aware of worker protection laws. Wells Fargo was ordered to pay $190 million earlier this month to settle civil charges alleging its employees had set up about 2 million accounts and credit cards in customers’ names that may not have been authorized. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman could not be immediately reached for comment after the close of business Monday but the company previously apologized to affected customers and said it fired 5,300 employees over “inappropriate sales conduct.” The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau alleged that the opening of these accounts was driven by a system that financially rewarded employees.  Federal prosecutors have since launched a criminal probe into the issue, a source previously told Reuters. The Labor Department polices a variety of things, including wage and hour rules, workplace safety, whistleblower protection laws and employee benefit plans. Perez said that the department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has received a number of whistleblower complaints from Wells Fargo employees over the past five years. Most of those complaints are concluded, with some settling and others found to have no merit, he said. Others are still currently under investigation, he added. “I have asked OSHA to review the entire docket of both closed and open Wells Fargo cases since 2010,” he said. Senator Warren, in a statement to Reuters, welcomed the department’s review. “Every other federal agency with jurisdiction in this matter should follow DOL’s lead and promptly determine whether Wells Fargo and its senior executives should be prosecuted or otherwise sanctioned,” she said.

1516,WFC,Wells Fargo's CEO pay clawback puts Wall Street executives on notice,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s unprecedented move to strip Chief Executive John Stumpf of $41 million in stock awards has sent a chill through Wall Street with bankers fearful that a hardening political climate against corporate wrongdoing will encourage boards to be more aggressive about making them forfeit pay. A sales practices scandal at Wells Fargo, where some of its employees opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge to hit sales targets, could not have come at a worse time for the wider industry with politicians in Washington reviewing new rules on bank executive remuneration. Bankers fear not only that the new rules on pay will be tightened as a result of the furor at Wells Fargo but also that boards will go beyond them to avoid a political backlash. “The Wells Fargo board made a mistake by not recouping some of the CEO’s pay until after the firestorm developed,” said Harvard Law School professor Jesse Fried. “Other boards will learn from this mistake.”  U.S. regulators are looking at requiring banks to defer compensation for senior officials and to allow clawbacks for misdeeds over the previous seven years. The law is meant to come into effect in 2019 and regulators are trying to get it finalized before a new president takes office in January. But banks’ legal advisers worry that the Wells Fargo scandal will result in them putting stiffer, more concrete requirements into their proposal, such as requiring banks to decide very quickly - perhaps in as little as 30 days - on clawing back compensation once misconduct has been discovered, according to the general counsel of a large Wall Street bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Banks are increasingly in Washington’s crosshairs with U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen telling a congressional committee on Wednesday that the central bank is considering changes to its annual stress test of the sector that would result in a significant increase in their overall capital requirements. Yellen also told the committee that the Fed was reviewing whether the largest U.S. lenders are complying with banking rules in the wake of what happened at Wells Fargo. The Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry said in his testimony before the U.S. Senate last week that the behavior at Wells Fargo highlights the need to complete the compensation rule. Clawback provisions were put in place or strengthened at all the top U.S. banks after the financial crisis of 2008, primarily to hold executives responsible for risk taking.  But the time period to claw back is often around three years, less than half the current proposal of seven years, and the proposed regulation would expand the pool of employees subject to it. Britain introduced laws last year that allow banks to seek recovery of bonuses from bankers deemed to have acted irresponsibly up to 10 years after they are paid out. Standard Chartered Plc has said it will try to claw back bonuses from up to 150 senior staff if they are found culpable of breaching internal rules around risk-taking during the tenure of former chief executive Peter Sands. But clawing back money from people who have already left a bank can be fraught with practical and legal difficulties.  Stumpf is the first CEO of a major U.S. bank to actually have to give back significant pay or benefits as the result of a scandal. Wells Fargo’s rule is written broadly enough that Stumpf was subject to a clawback even though the bank’s $185 million fine did not force it to make a material restatement of its results. The rules vary from bank to bank, but they generally allow the banks to take back stock awards or pay for misconduct, taking improper risks or poor performance. Executives can also be penalized if the bank has to significantly restate results. Compensation consultants said that increased clawbacks could make it more difficult for banks to recruit and keep top talent with bonuses at investment and commercial banks down about 40 percent since the financial crisis. “Compensation is going to be a much more political process going forward. You’re going to based not only on your merits but what is politically attractive at the moment,” said Alan Johnson, managing director of compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates. He said the Wells Fargo scandal will have blunted industry efforts to soften the impending remuneration rules. “Whatever progress had been made in lobbying some features now has been set back to zero,” he said. “Who is going to listen to the banking industry now?”  Still, David Knutson, head of credit research in the Americas for Schroder Investment Management, believes CEOs at other banks will be more careful with their own businesses now that they have seen what happened to Stumpf.  “When you see a colleague you’ve known for years all of a sudden lose $40 million, it makes you more cautious,” he said.  ",9282016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-accounts-clawbacks/wells-fargos-ceo-pay-clawback-puts-wall-street-executives-on-notice-idUSKCN11Y358
1517,WFC,Wells Fargo plans to eliminate sales goals sooner than planned,"(Reuters) - Embattled Wells Fargo & Co plans to eliminate sales goals for its retail banking business sooner than planned, according to prepared remarks its chief executive officer will deliver at a congressional hearing on Thursday. Wells Fargo is under pressure to show it is holding top brass accountable after government investigators discovered that  employees opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge in order to meet sales targets. On Tuesday, Wells Fargo said CEO John Stumpf will forfeit unvested equity awards worth about $41 million and will not get a salary while the company’s board investigates the bank’s sales practices. The third largest U.S. bank will eliminate the goals by Oct. 1, earlier than its previous target of Jan. 1, 2017, according to the remarks, which were obtained by Reuters. Stumpf will appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday. The San Francisco-based bank agreed to pay $190 million earlier this month to settle regulatory charges over the account scandal and has fired about 5,300 employees, most of them low-ranking staff, in connection with it. Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of the retail division at the center of the burgeoning sales scandal, will get no severance and forfeited unvested equity awards worth about $19 million, the bank said. Tolstedt left the company before her planned Dec. 31 retirement date.  Stumpf and Tolstedt will also not receive bonuses for 2016. The penalties represent one of the biggest financial sanctions ever levied against a major bank boss and mark a sharp change from a few years ago when no CEO had to give back a bonus despite scandals at large banks. A special committee of the bank’s independent directors will lead an investigation into the retail bank’s sales practices, helped by the board’s human resources committee and law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP, according to the bank. “We are deeply concerned by these matters, and we are committed to ensuring that all aspects of the company’s business are conducted with integrity, transparency, and oversight,” Stephen Sanger, the board’s lead independent director, said. Stumpf, a member of the board, has recused himself from the investigation, the bank said. Wells Fargo stock added 0.2 percent to $45.19. Up to Tuesday’s close, shares had fallen nearly 10 percent since Sept. 8, when it reached a settlement with regulators, wiping off about $24 billion of market capitalization.

1520,WFC,California suspends business relationships with Wells Fargo,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California State Treasurer John Chiang on Wednesday announced a sweeping suspension of business relationships with Wells Fargo & Co as punishment for the company’s defrauding of customers. In addition, Chiang vowed to work with the state’s two giant public pension funds to change the management structure at the bank, which is California’s oldest financial institution. The sanctions, which will last for 12 months, include suspending Wells Fargo as a managing underwriter on state negotiated bond sales. California is the nation’s largest issuer of municipal debt. “We want to make sure that Wells Fargo understands its errors, and we want to make sure there is meaningful change,” Chiang told reporters, adding that the bank would not be happy with the State’s actions. “We hit them with the three most highly profitable lines of business,” Chiang said. Wells Fargo responded that company understood “the concerns that have been raised,” and promised to “address these issues and rebuild the state’s trust.” The company’s stock rose 0.48 percent to close at $45.31. Wells Fargo on Sept. 8 agreed to pay $190 million to settle a case by California prosecutors and federal regulators over what were potentially more than 2 million unauthorized credit card and deposit accounts opened by branch employees scrambling to meet sales quotas. The bank said it fired 5,300 employees over the issue. Chiang, who oversees nearly $2 trillion of California’s annual banking transactions and manages a $75-billion investment pool, called for the state to suspend Wells Fargo’s “most highly profitable business relationships with the state of California.” On Tuesday, the day before the announcement of sanctions, California postponed two bond sales totaling nearly $740 million in order to replace Wells Fargo as the senior manager. The sanctions also suspended state investments in all Wells Fargo securities and halted the use of Wells Fargo as a broker-dealer for investment purchasing. “Wells Fargo’s fleecing of its customers by opening fraudulent accounts for the purpose of extracting millions in illegal fees demonstrates, at best, a reckless lack of institutional control and, at worst, a culture which actively promotes wanton greed,” Chiang said in a letter to Wells Fargo’s chairman and chief executive, John Stumpf, and bank board members. Chiang called Stumpf’s responses to a U.S. Senate Finance Committee inquiry “disheartening” and “callous.” Chiang promised to work closely with the state’s two public pension funds, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, to among other things, advocate for the separation of the bank’s CEO and chairman roles and to appoint a consumer ombudsman. Together, these funds hold more than $2.3 billion in Wells Fargo fixed income and equity instruments. Chiang called for the bank to develop a whistleblower protection program and to “claw back” some executive compensation.

1521,WFC,UPDATE 3-California suspends business relationships with Wells Fargo,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - California State Treasurer John Chiang on Wednesday announced a sweeping suspension of business relationships with Wells Fargo & Co as punishment for the company’s defrauding of customers. In addition, Chiang vowed to work with the state’s two giant public pension funds to change the management structure at the bank, which is California’s oldest financial institution. The sanctions, which will last for 12 months, include suspending Wells Fargo as a managing underwriter on state negotiated bond sales. California is the nation’s largest issuer of municipal debt. “We want to make sure that Wells Fargo understands its errors, and we want to make sure there is meaningful change,” Chiang told reporters, adding that the bank would not be happy with the State’s actions. “We hit them with the three most highly profitable lines of business,” Chiang said. Wells Fargo responded that company understood “the concerns that have been raised,” and promised to “address these issues and rebuild the state’s trust.” The company’s stock rose 0.48 percent to close at $45.31. Wells Fargo on Sept. 8 agreed to pay $190 million to settle a case by California prosecutors and federal regulators over what were potentially more than 2 million unauthorized credit card and deposit accounts opened by branch employees scrambling to meet sales quotas. The bank said it fired 5,300 employees over the issue. Chiang, who oversees nearly $2 trillion of California’s annual banking transactions and manages a $75-billion investment pool, called for the state to suspend Wells Fargo’s “most highly profitable business relationships with the state of California.” On Tuesday, the day before the announcement of sanctions, California postponed two bond sales totaling nearly $740 million in order to replace Wells Fargo as the senior manager. The sanctions also suspended state investments in all Wells Fargo securities and halted the use of Wells Fargo as a broker-dealer for investment purchasing. “Wells Fargo’s fleecing of its customers by opening fraudulent accounts for the purpose of extracting millions in illegal fees demonstrates, at best, a reckless lack of institutional control and, at worst, a culture which actively promotes wanton greed,” Chiang said in a letter to Wells Fargo’s chairman and chief executive, John Stumpf, and bank board members. Chiang called Stumpf’s responses to a U.S. Senate Finance Committee inquiry “disheartening” and “callous.” Chiang promised to work closely with the state’s two public pension funds, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, to among other things, advocate for the separation of the bank’s CEO and chairman roles and to appoint a consumer ombudsman. Together, these funds hold more than $2.3 billion in Wells Fargo fixed income and equity instruments. Chiang called for the bank to develop a whistleblower protection program and to “claw back” some executive compensation.  Stumpf is already forfeiting unvested equity awards of $41 million and will not get a salary during a board investigation. The bank will face tougher sanctions or permanent severance with the California’s Treasurer’s Office if it does not comply with the sanctions, Chiang said.

1522,WFC,RPT-Wells Fargo's CEO pay clawback puts Wall Street execs on notice,"(Repeats to additional subscribers with no changes to text) By Olivia Oran and Ross Kerber NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s  unprecedented move to strip Chief Executive John Stumpf of $41 million in stock awards has sent a chill through Wall Street with bankers fearful that a hardening political climate against corporate wrongdoing will encourage boards to be more aggressive about making them forfeit pay. A sales practices scandal at Wells Fargo, where some of its employees opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge to hit sales targets, could not have come at a worse time for the wider industry with politicians in Washington reviewing new rules on bank executive remuneration. Bankers fear not only that the new rules on pay will be tightened as a result of the furor at Wells Fargo but also that boards will go beyond them to avoid a political backlash. “The Wells Fargo board made a mistake by not recouping some of the CEO’s pay until after the firestorm developed,” said Harvard Law School professor Jesse Fried. “Other boards will learn from this mistake.” U.S. regulators are looking at requiring banks to defer compensation for senior officials and to allow clawbacks for misdeeds over the previous seven years. The law is meant to come into effect in 2019 and regulators are trying to get it finalized before a new president takes office in January. But banks’ legal advisers worry that the Wells Fargo scandal will result in them putting stiffer, more concrete requirements into their proposal, such as requiring banks to decide very quickly - perhaps in as little as 30 days - on clawing back compensation once misconduct has been discovered, according to the general counsel of a large Wall Street bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Banks are increasingly in Washington’s crosshairs with U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen telling a congressional committee on Wednesday that the central bank is considering changes to its annual stress test of the sector that would result in a significant increase in their overall capital requirements. Yellen also told the committee that the Fed was reviewing whether the largest U.S. lenders are complying with banking rules in the wake of what happened at Wells Fargo. The Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry said in his testimony before the U.S. Senate last week that the behavior at Wells Fargo highlights the need to complete the compensation rule. Clawback provisions were put in place or strengthened at all the top U.S. banks after the financial crisis of 2008, primarily to hold executives responsible for risk taking. But the time period to claw back is often around three years, less than half the current proposal of seven years, and the proposed regulation would expand the pool of employees subject to it. Britain introduced laws last year that allow banks to seek recovery of bonuses from bankers deemed to have acted irresponsibly up to 10 years after they are paid out. Standard Chartered Plc has said it will try to claw back bonuses from up to 150 senior staff if they are found culpable of breaching internal rules around risk-taking during the tenure of former chief executive Peter Sands. But clawing back money from people who have already left a bank can be fraught with practical and legal difficulties. Stumpf is the first CEO of a major U.S. bank to actually have to give back significant pay or benefits as the result of a scandal. Wells Fargo’s rule is written broadly enough that Stumpf was subject to a clawback even though the bank’s $185 million fine did not force it to make a material restatement of its results. The rules vary from bank to bank, but they generally allow the banks to take back stock awards or pay for misconduct, taking improper risks or poor performance. Executives can also be penalized if the bank has to significantly restate results. Compensation consultants said that increased clawbacks could make it more difficult for banks to recruit and keep top talent with bonuses at investment and commercial banks down about 40 percent since the financial crisis. “Compensation is going to be a much more political process going forward. You’re going to based not only on your merits but what is politically attractive at the moment,” said Alan Johnson, managing director of compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates. He said the Wells Fargo scandal will have blunted industry efforts to soften the impending remuneration rules. “Whatever progress had been made in lobbying some features now has been set back to zero,” he said. “Who is going to listen to the banking industry now?” Still, David Knutson, head of credit research in the Americas for Schroder Investment Management, believes CEOs at other banks will be more careful with their own businesses now that they have seen what happened to Stumpf. “When you see a colleague you’ve known for years all of a sudden lose $40 million, it makes you more cautious,” he said.

1527,WFC,U.S. House panel lambastes Wells Fargo boss over phantom accounts,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers called on Thursday for Wells Fargo & Co chief John Stumpf to resign and a top House Democrat demanded the bank be broken up because it is too big to manage. Stumpf’s second trip to Capitol Hill on Thursday went no better than his first as lawmakers from both parties rebuked his handling of sales abuses and said the bank had damaged customer trust as well as the broader banking system. Wells Fargo staff opened checking, savings and credit card accounts without customer say-so for years to satisfy managers’ demand for new business, according to a $190 million settlement with regulators reached early this month. U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, the committee’s senior Democrat, faulted the bank for identity theft in the fraud and called for Wells Fargo to be dismantled because it was too big to manage. She called the sales abuses “some of the most egregious fraud we have seen since the foreclosure crisis.” After the hearing, the California lawmaker told reporters she would introduce legislation to break up Wells Fargo. The bank has said as many as 2 million accounts may have been wrongly opened and Stumpf promised to undo any harm to customers. The chief executive said, however, that Wells Fargo did not expect to see disgruntled bank customers in court. Wells Fargo is offering arbitration for its unhappy clients, Stumpf said. Pushed about whether he would waive that mandatory arbitration rule and allow customers to sue, Stumpf said: “No.” Members of the House Financial Services Committee blasted Stumpf over the bank’s culture, his compensation and whether the right people were being punished for opening fee-generating, phantom accounts. The episode has been a stunning reversal for Stumpf, long regarded as a safe pair of hands in the industry for navigating Wells Fargo successfully through the financial crisis. Stumpf again heard lawmakers calling for him to step aside. Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the committee, said in his opening statement he had lost faith in Wells Fargo, which does some of his banking. “Mr. Stumpf, I have a mortgage with your bank,” Hensarling said. “I wish I didn’t. I wish I was in the position to pay it off because you have broken my trust as you have broken the trust of millions.” Wells Fargo shares fell 2.07 percent to $44.37. Since Sept. 7, the last trading day before the scandal broke, its stock has lost 11 percent, or about $27 billion in market value, based on Reuters data. The stock is trading at its lowest since early 2014. Republicans on the committee have often advocated easing Wall Street regulations, but they were among Stumpf’s strongest critics at Thursday’s hearing. Asked by Representative Sean Duffy, a Republican from Wisconsin, about whether Wells Fargo employees ‘stole,’ Stumpf said: “In some cases, they did.” “I am deeply sorry that we didn’t do the right thing,” Stumpf said in response to a lawmaker who said the scandal had eroded the bank’s market value. Representative Steve Pearce, a Republican from New Mexico, faulted Stumpf for saying the company’s board could eventually be relied on to sanction the executives responsible. “I, sir, think you ought to submit a resignation and your board cannot hold off action on that,” he said. Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat from California, asked the committee to summon other Wall Street chiefs, including from Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp , to determine if they had imposed sales demands and quotas on their employees. “I don’t think, Mr. Stumpf, that you should be alone in this joyous experience,” Sherman said. Stumpf said the bank was strengthening oversight of sales tactics, changing procedures for issuing credit cards and had paid back past and current customers for any fees incurrent on the ghost accounts. Earlier this week, the bank took back $41 million in stock awarded to Stumpf, an unprecedented rebuke to a major U.S. bank chief executive officer. Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York raised questions about $13 million in stock sales by the CEO in 2013 after he learned about the abuses. Stumpf said he sold stock with proper approvals and added the sales were made “with no view about what was going on.” The affair has triggered lawsuits, more investigations and wiped more than $20 billion from the bank’s market value. While Wells Fargo may be shielded from some customer actions, the bank may just be starting to face heightened regulatory scrutiny. On Thursday, the bank agreed to pay the Justice Department $4.1 million to resolve allegations it illegally repossessed cars owned by U.S. service members. In a separate settlement of similar allegations, the bank will pay a $20 million settlement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

1532,WFC,US STOCKS-Wall St falls sharply on worries about banks,"(Reuters) - Wall Street dropped on Thursday, weighed down by Apple as well as selling in Wells Fargo, Citigroup and other major banks as investors worried about the health of Deutsche Bank. The S&P; 500 financial index declined 1.49 percent after Bloomberg reported that some hedge funds have withdrawn excess cash and positions held at the German lender.  Growing concerns over the stability of Germany’s biggest bank have pushed its shares to record lows and its U.S.-listed stock on Thursday tumbled 6.7 percent.  “This Deutsche Bank story is really casting a very long shadow over equity markets,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. “In some respects, it speaks to fears over large money-center banks having serious problems, and the last time we had that conversation was the financial crisis.” Adding to negative sentiment in the banking sector, Wells Fargo & Co lost 2.07 percent after U.S. lawmakers rebuked CEO John Stumpf over his handling of sales abuses. Citigroup dropped 2.28 percent and JPMorgan Chase fell 1.59 percent. Apple fell 1.55 percent after Barclays cut its price target. The stock was the biggest drag on Wall Street. The S&P; healthcare index lost 1.84 percent and also weighed heavily on the S&P; 500 as shares of Merck and Johnson & Johnson declined.  Among the gainers, Qualcomm jumped 6.3 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported the chipmaker is in talks to buy NXP Semiconductors. NXP surged 16.88 percent. Up 5 percent this year, the S&P; 500 is trading near 16 times expected earnings, above its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. “Equity valuations are stretched and priced for perfection,” said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. “I would not be surprised to see additional volatility.”  The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of near-term investor anxiety, jumped 14 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 1.07 percent to 18,143.45 points at the close, its sharpest decline since Sept 13.  The S&P; 500 lost 0.93 percent to end at 2,151.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.93 percent to 5,269.15. The S&P; utilities index, which is sensitive to interest rates, fell 1.45 percent, its fifth day of losses in a row.      Oil prices were up a day after OPEC members agreed to curb production, even as analysts raised questions about the effectiveness of the deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.87-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.09-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 22 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 35 new lows.   About 7.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 7.0 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Alderman Edward Burke, who heads the Chicago City Council’s finance committee, introduced an ordinance on Friday that would suspend the bank from acting in several capacities, including as a municipal depository, bond underwriter and financial adviser. “The city council should not engage in any business for the next two years with this institution that has deceived, defrauded and duped its customers,” Burke said in a statement. Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs set a Monday news conference to announce “plans to suspend billions of dollars in investment activity with Wells Fargo,” according to an advisory from his office on Friday. Wells Fargo staff opened checking, savings and credit card accounts without customer say-so for years to satisfy managers’ demand for new business, according to a $190 million settlement with regulators reached on Sept. 8. The bank said it fired 5,300 employees over the issue. On Wednesday, California State Treasurer John Chiang announced a sweeping suspension of the state’s business relationships with Wells Fargo for the next 12 months.

1539,WFC,U.S. House panel lambastes Wells Fargo boss over phantom accounts,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers called on Thursday for Wells Fargo & Co chief John Stumpf to resign and a top House Democrat demanded the bank be broken up because it is too big to manage. Stumpf’s second trip to Capitol Hill on Thursday went no better than his first as lawmakers from both parties rebuked his handling of sales abuses and said the bank had damaged customer trust as well as the broader banking system. Wells Fargo staff opened checking, savings and credit card accounts without customer say-so for years to satisfy managers’ demand for new business, according to a $190 million settlement with regulators reached early this month. U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, the committee’s senior Democrat, faulted the bank for identity theft in the fraud and called for Wells Fargo to be dismantled because it was too big to manage.  She called the sales abuses “some of the most egregious fraud we have seen since the foreclosure crisis.” After the hearing, the California lawmaker told reporters she would introduce legislation to break up Wells Fargo. The bank has said as many as 2 million accounts may have been wrongly opened and Stumpf promised to undo any harm to customers. The chief executive said, however, that Wells Fargo did not expect to see disgruntled bank customers in court. Wells Fargo is offering arbitration for its unhappy clients, Stumpf said. Pushed about whether he would waive that mandatory arbitration rule and allow customers to sue, Stumpf said: “No.”  Members of the House Financial Services Committee blasted Stumpf over the bank’s culture, his compensation and whether the right people were being punished for opening fee-generating, phantom accounts. The episode has been a stunning reversal for Stumpf, long regarded as a safe pair of hands in the industry for navigating Wells Fargo successfully through the financial crisis. Stumpf again heard lawmakers calling for him to step aside. Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the committee, said in his opening statement he had lost faith in Wells Fargo, which does some of his banking.   “Mr. Stumpf, I have a mortgage with your bank,” Hensarling said. “I wish I didn’t. I wish I was in the position to pay it off because you have broken my trust as you have broken the trust of millions.” Wells Fargo shares fell 2.07 percent to $44.37. Since Sept. 7, the last trading day before the scandal broke, its stock has lost 11 percent, or about $27 billion in market value, based on Reuters data. The stock is trading at its lowest since early 2014. Republicans on the committee have often advocated easing Wall Street regulations, but they were among Stumpf’s strongest critics at Thursday’s hearing. Asked by Representative Sean Duffy, a Republican from Wisconsin, about whether Wells Fargo employees ‘stole,’ Stumpf said: “In some cases, they did.” “I am deeply sorry that we didn’t do the right thing,” Stumpf said in response to a lawmaker who said the scandal had eroded the bank’s market value. Representative Steve Pearce, a Republican from New Mexico, faulted Stumpf for saying the company’s board could eventually be relied on to sanction the executives responsible. “I, sir, think you ought to submit a resignation and your board cannot hold off action on that,” he said.  Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat from California, asked the committee to summon other Wall Street chiefs, including from Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp, to determine if they had imposed sales demands and quotas on their employees. “I don’t think, Mr. Stumpf, that you should be alone in this joyous experience,” Sherman said. Stumpf said the bank was strengthening oversight of sales tactics, changing procedures for issuing credit cards and had paid back past and current customers for any fees incurrent on the ghost accounts. Earlier this week, the bank took back $41 million in stock awarded to Stumpf, an unprecedented rebuke to a major U.S. bank chief executive officer. Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York raised questions about $13 million in stock sales by the CEO in 2013 after he learned about the abuses. Stumpf said he sold stock with proper approvals and added the sales were made “with no view about what was going on.”  The affair has triggered lawsuits, more investigations and wiped more than $20 billion from the bank’s market value. While Wells Fargo may be shielded from some customer actions, the bank may just be starting to face heightened regulatory scrutiny. On Thursday, the bank agreed to pay the Justice Department $4.1 million to resolve allegations it illegally repossessed cars owned by U.S. service members. In a separate settlement of similar allegations, the bank will pay a $20 million settlement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

1542,WFC,Clinton promises to hold Wells Fargo accountable,"TOLEDO, Ohio (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Monday vowed to hold Wells Fargo accountable for “egregious corporate behavior” in a scandal over employees’ opening millions of accounts without customers’ knowledge. “Really shocking isn’t it? One of the nations’ biggest banks bullying thousands of employees into committing fraud against unsuspecting customers,” Clinton told a crowd in Ohio, a crucial battleground in the Nov. 8 presidential election against Republican Donald Trump.  In Toledo, an area that has lost manufacturing jobs, Clinton said she wanted to “send a clear message to every boardroom and executive suite” that they companies will be held accountable if they “scam” customers, “exploit” employees and “rip off” tax payers.  “To understand why this is so important, consider the recent examples we’ve seen of egregious corporate behavior,” she said, citing Wells Fargo.    Ahead of Clinton’s speech, her campaign released a plan to help consumers to sue corporations in court instead of being forced to take disputes to private arbitration. Mandatory arbitration clauses make class action suits difficult or impossible to bring.  Clinton said the Wells Fargo (WFC.N) case shed light on how such agreements harm consumers. “We are not going to let companies like Wells Fargo use these fine print gotchas to escape accountability,” Clinton added.     Consumer advocates say mandatory individual arbitration makes it prohibitively expensive to take legal action and does not set a legal precedent to help other affected individuals. Wells Fargo has come under fire for using arbitration clauses after it came to light that the bank’s employees opened as many as 2 million checking, savings and credit card accounts without the customers’ permission in order to meet sales quotas.  Wells Fargo reached a $190 million settlement with federal regulators last month. Its customers have been unable to sue because their contracts said they would arbitrate disputes instead of suing Wells Fargo in court. Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf recently said he did not expect the bank to waive the clauses. Democratic lawmakers in Congress, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have called on Wells Fargo to allow customers to sue. “They are forced into a closed-door arbitration process without the important protections you get in a court of law,” Clinton said. Clinton’s plan calls on Congress to give agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, Federal Communications Commission and Department of Labor the authority to restrict arbitration clauses in consumer, employment and antitrust agreements.

1543,WFC,US STOCKS-Wall St dips in slow start to fourth quarter,"(Reuters) - The fourth quarter got off to a weak start for U.S. stock investors on Monday, with financials, consumer staples and utilities pulling the S&P; 500 lower. Major indexes have bounced between gains and losses in the past few days, with investors nervous about the outcome of a tight race for the White House ahead of the Nov. 8 election.  Big banks extended recent declines as investors worried about the stability of Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and also Wells Fargo & Co’s (WFC.N) handling of sales abuses.  U.S-listed shares of Deutsche slipped 0.85 percent as hopes faded of a swift deal with U.S. authorities over a multi-billion dollar penalty for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities. “The feeling is there will be a negotiation lowering that penalty but it’s certainly a bit of an overhang on the overall market,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. The S&P; 500 financial index .SPSY declined 0.43 percent as Wells Fargo (WFC.N) slid 1.02 percent to its lowest since December 2013. Also weighing on investor sentiment was a plan announced by Britain on Sunday to start its separation from the European Union by March.  With yields on U.S. Treasury bonds up following stronger-than-expected U.S. manufacturing data for September, the interest-rate sensitive utility sector .SPLRCU fell 1.35 percent.  The consumer staples index declined 0.6 percent, with Procter & Gamble (PG.N) falling 1.21 percent.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 0.3 percent to end the session at 18,253.85 points and the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 0.33 percent to 2,161.2. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC slipped 0.21 percent to 5,300.87 points. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, well below the 7.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. S&P; 500 companies on average are expected to posts a 0.5 percent dip in third-quarter earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. That would mark a fifth straight quarter of year-over-year earnings declines, in large part due to weak oil prices. Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) jumped 4.74 percent after the electric carmaker said third-quarter deliveries rose by 70 percent to 24,500 cars.  Cabela’s CAB.N surged 15.02 percent after the retailer said it would be acquired by Bass Pro Shops in a deal valued at about $5.5 billion.     Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.40-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P; 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 32 new lows.

1546,WFC,Chevron supports director Stumpf despite Wells Fargo morass,"HOUSTON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp on Monday said it stands behind John Stumpf, a member of its board and the chief executive of bank Wells Fargo & Co, despite growing concerns about his leadership during a customer service scandal. Pressure has mounted on Stumpf in recent days to resign as CEO of Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. bank by deposits, after revelations the bank for years opened checking, savings and credit card accounts without customer approval to satisfy managers’ demands for new business. Lawmakers of both major U.S. political parties in Congress have excoriated Stumpf, accusing him of creating a culture in which such a practice could thrive. Earlier this month Stumpf resigned from an advisory role at the U.S. Federal Reserve. Chevron executives had cited his experience and reputation as a major benefit to its shareholders when recommending him to the board. The company’s board also noted his position at the Fed when it nominated him to the board. “John (Stumpf) is a valued member of our board,” Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said in an emailed statement to Reuters. “Given the investigations that are underway, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.” Stumpf joined the Chevron board in 2010, the same year he became chairman of the San Francisco-based bank and three years after he became its CEO. Both companies are headquartered in California’s Bay Area and are roughly 35 miles (55 km) apart. Stumpf also sits on the board of retailer Target Corp , which did not immediately return a request for comment. At Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil and natural gas producer, Stumpf serves on board committees that oversee corporate governance and executive compensation. Chevron does not hold any meaningful stake in Wells Fargo.

1547,WFC,Clinton expected to hit Wells Fargo in speech on 'bad corporate actors',"WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., Oct 3 (Reuters) - U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Monday will unveil a plan to make it easier for consumers to take legal action against “bad corporate actors,” citing Wells Fargo & Co and Mylan Pharmaceuticals, according to a campaign official. While campaigning in Ohio, the Democratic nominee will explain how she would, if elected on Nov. 8, curb the prevalence of contractual clauses that require consumers, employees and other individuals to resolve legal disputes in private arbitration proceedings instead of in courts, her campaign said. Mandatory arbitration clauses sometimes require that claims be pursued on an individual basis instead of on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals. Consumer advocates say this makes it prohibitively expensive to take legal action. Clinton will call on the U.S. Congress to give agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Labor the authority to restrict the use of arbitration clauses in consumer, employment and antitrust agreements, according to a preliminary plan reviewed by Reuters. Clinton will also discuss how she believes that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other agencies already have the authority to curb the use of such clauses under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. The planning document said she would urge the Securities and Exchange Commission to exercise its authority to make related rules authorized by the financial reform law. Wells Fargo is expected to be in the crosshairs when Clinton discusses how she would curb mandatory arbitration clauses. For years, the bank’s employees opened as many as 2 million checking, savings and credit card accounts without the customers’ permission in order to meet sales quotas. Wells Fargo reached a $190 million settlement with federal regulators earlier this month. When Wells Fargo chief John Stumpf testified before Congress recently about the unauthorized accounts, he said he did not expect the bank to waive a clause signed by its customers in order to open their authorized accounts. The clause said they would arbitrate disputes instead of suing Wells Fargo in court. Democratic lawmakers in Congress, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have called on Wells Fargo to toss out the mandatory arbitration clause and allow customers to sue. Clinton is also expected to criticize Mylan for sharply raising without justification the price of EpiPens, which deliver life-saving drugs to those with allergies. The criticism will be part of a larger push to curb excessive market concentration and encourage competition that benefits consumers, her campaign said.

Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects the company's superior earnings profile, strong  liquidity, and still benign asset quality. Fitch has revised the Outlook to  Negative given the uncertain impact to WFC's franchise resulting from the  potential reputational damage from the recent regulatory actions and fines  related to its sales practices in its Community Banking business line. In  particular, Fitch believes that the firm could face earnings pressure as a  result, with earnings being a significant competitive strength for WFC.  The recent $185 million fine levied on WFC for improper sales practices dating  back to 2011 was fully accrued for and represents just a fraction of WFC's  quarterly earnings of approximately $5.5 billion. Customer damages appear  limited, with $2.6 million refunded and with WFC earmarking up to $5 million to  cover this and any additional required customer remediation. However, Fitch  views the ensuing reputational damage, risk oversight failures, impact to its  selling practices, and the resulting effect on earnings as much larger issues  than the actual fine. While this issue is not new, as it was first reported by the media in 2013 and  the Los Angeles city attorney filed suit in May 2015, the breadth of the issue  is surprising. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Consent Order  disclosed that WFC opened up more than 1.5 million deposit accounts and over  500,000 credit card accounts that may not have been authorized. Further, this  appears to be a significant breakdown in what Fitch has long viewed as a solid  risk management infrastructure.  WFC's earnings profile has been superior to peers, in part due to its  cross-selling culture. WFC recently disclosed that the company would eliminate  all product sales goals in retail banking effective Oct. 1, 2016. This change  may impact the company's revenue streams in the future. While WFC emerged from  the financial crisis in a much better position than similarly sized peers, Fitch  believes this issue creates reputational risk given the issue and allegations  are understandable to the general public, in a way that misdeeds at other banks  are not.  There is also an outstanding lawsuit filed by the city of Miami against WFC and  Bank of America for alleged predatory lending. The U.S. Supreme Court will rule  whether the city of Miami is allowed to bring the lawsuits in 2017. Fitch also  expects further lawsuits and investigations related to the sales practices. A  class action lawsuit has been filed in Utah. Adverse outcomes on these issues  could further impair WFC's reputation.  Fitch has viewed WFC's management team and risk management culture favorably.  There has been a great deal of stability in the executive management ranks, with  little turnover. However, this does represent a significant breakdown in the  risk management infrastructure and oversight. Carrie Tolstedt announced her  retirement in mid-July 2016. She formerly ran the Community Banking business  line, which included the branch network. It is unclear whether there will be  further executive management departures. However, Fitch expects the situation to  be somewhat fluid, garnering a great deal of regulatory, political, and  potential legal attention over the near term.  Providing support to the ratings and underpinning today's rating affirmation,  WFC's financial performance has been solid over the past several years despite a  challenging economic and interest rate environment. While current earnings are  below pre-crisis levels, they exceed large regional bank peer medians and are in  line with Fitch's expectations. WFC's superior earnings performance and capital  generation capabilities are core strengths for the company and positive rating  drivers that differentiate it from its peers. Fitch attributes WFC's superior earnings profile to its low funding costs,  efficient cost structure, and a diversified business model by geography and  product type that has proven resilient over time. Further, Fitch assumes that  WFC has been able to benefit post-financial crisis from a flight to quality.  It is hard to discern how much of WFC's strong sales culture also contributed to  its earnings profile, but Fitch acknowledges that the bank was at the forefront  of recognizing the profitability of customers who have multiple products with a  bank and hence was an early and strong advocate of cross-selling. Other banks'  incentive practices may have also contributed to improper sales practices, and  there may be changes to compensation practices at other banks and/or regulatory  findings.  WFC's stated strategic objectives are clearly articulated, and achievable. The  company recently lowered its ROA and ROE targets to 1.1% to 1.4% and 11% to 14%,  respectively. These growth targets are intended to reflect the company's  performance over the next two years and are not long-term targets.  Fitch views the revision as expected given the challenging interest rate  environment, and lackluster economic growth. Fitch also believes the adjustment  is prudent and expects the company is not going to compromise its risk appetite  for short-term earnings.  WFC's franchise has been considered one of the strongest of all U.S. banks, with  leading market shares in many sectors and asset classes. WFC has the second most  deposits in the U.S., and over 90% of its deposits are in states where its  deposit market share is ranked first, second, or third.  WFC's capital profile is also considered solid, relative to its risk profile,  capital generation capabilities, and target payout ranges. The Common Equity  Tier 1 under Basel III Standardized Approach, fully phased-in, was 10.61% at  June 30, 2016, above the company's long-term target of 10%, which includes the  2% G-SIB capital surcharge. Fitch expects that WFC's long-term capital target  will be higher than many of its regional peers, which may manage to long-term  capital targets of between 8% and 9.5%. Over the near term, it is not  anticipated that WFC will be able to manage its capital down to 10% given  relatively sluggish economic growth. Over the past six months, WFC's CET1 has  only declined 16bps.  WFC's liquidity profile is considered the strongest of the large regional peer  group. Since 2005, WFC has reported the lowest cost of deposits and lowest cost  of total funding, on average, among its peer group. The proposed TLAC rule has a  relatively higher burden for WFC than some of its G-SIB peers, given the make-up  of WFC's existing balance sheet, which benefits much more from WFC's low-cost  deposit funding. As WFC issues more long-term debt in preparation, its  profitability will be impacted. Over the past six months, WFC issued $48 billion  in long-term debt, as compared to $14 billion during the same period last year.  In addition to proposed TLAC rules impacting the composition of the balance  sheet, the LCR has also contributed to a large increase in cash and short-term  investments. Together, these assets account for 17% of the balance sheet, up  from 11% at year-end 2012. WFC does not disclose its LCR, only that it exceeds  the requirement with an internal buffer. In terms of WFC's asset quality, WFC's NPA ratios remain elevated and above the  regional bank peer median. Much of the weaker relative performance is due to a  large balance of mortgage-related accruing TDRs, of which 86% are current.  Despite higher NPA levels, NCOs are roughly in line with peer averages. Fitch  expects loan losses will increase from currently unsustainably low levels for  WFC, as well as the industry, especially under a higher interest rate  environment. However, higher provisioning should not materially impact WFC's  financial profile given its earnings strength. Further, excluding GE-acquired  loans, total loan balances are up approximately 5% during the past 12 months,  suggesting WFC is not assuming outsized risk.  While WFC is still growing mortgage, automobile and credit card loans, a mix  shift is underway with a greater percentage of commercial loans than even just a  year ago. Period-end commercial loans accounted for 52% of total loans at June  30, 2016, up from 49% a year ago. Commercial loans tend to have a lower loss  rate than consumer loans. WFC's view of long-term losses has been reduced to  65bps from 75bps disclosed two years ago. The estimate on long-term losses  includes an average cycle of approximately nine to 10 years and a recession of  average severity, and the improvement reflects the aforementioned shift in the  loan portfolio, and credit quality improvement to date.  Although WFC is one of the largest participants in the energy-sector, overall  O&G; funded loans represent less than 2% of total loans and around 12% of  tangible common equity. WFC was one of the first banks to materially increase  loan loss reserves for this sector. Fitch views this as prudent given a higher  relative balance of sub-investment grade credits and approximately half of loans  to businesses in the E&P; sector. Reserves at quarter-end totaled $1.6 billion,  or roughly 3.4 times realized losses year-to-date. The ultimate future and direction of Wells Fargo Securities, WFC's trade name  for its capital markets and investment banking services, remain of interest to  Fitch. Although WFC continues to stress the customer-focused strategy and lack  of interest in acquisitions in this space, the bank has been growing in this  sector following some downsizing in 2008 and 2009 after the acquisition of  Wachovia. Fitch expects any expansion by WFC in capital markets to remain a  primarily customer-focused strategy, and for it to remain relatively small in  terms of the bank's total business mix. Investment banking revenues comprised  1.7% of revenues in 1H16, with trading gains, gains on debt securities, and  gains on equity investments contributing another 3.7% of revenues, a relatively  modest amount as compared to similarly-sized peers.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES WFC's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a+' for loss  severity. WFC's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while WFC's trust  preferred securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two  times for non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria  and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk  profiles and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank  Northwest are rated one notch higher than Wells Fargo Bank's IDR and senior  unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor  preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior  recovery prospects in the event of default.  WFC's international subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank International's deposit ratings  are at the same level as senior debt ratings because their preferential status  is less clear and disclosure concerning dually payable deposits makes it  difficult to determine if they are eligible for U.S. depositor preference. HOLDING COMPANY  WFC's VR is equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY Wells Fargo Bank N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank Northwest N.A. are rated 'AA'. The  banks' ratings are one notch above the parent reflecting the expected  implementation of total loss absorbing capital (TLAC) requirements for U.S.  Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) and the presence of a substantial  debt buffer in the holding company. The VRs remain equalized between WFC and its material operating subsidiaries.  The common VR of WFC and its operating companies reflects the correlated  performance, or failure rate between the WFC and these subsidiaries. Fitch takes  a group view on the credit profile from a failure perspective, while the IDR  reflects each entity's non-performance (default) risk on senior debt. Fitch  believes that the likelihood of failure is roughly equivalent, while the default  risk given at the operating company would be lower given TLAC. All U.S. bank  subsidiaries carry a common VR, regardless of size, as U.S. banks are  cross-guaranteed under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and  Enforcement Act (FIRREA).  Wells Fargo Canada Corp., Wells Fargo Bank International, and Wells Fargo  Securities International Limited are wholly owned subsidiaries of WFC or Wells  Fargo Bank, N.A. Their IDRs and debt ratings are aligned with WFC reflecting  Fitch's view that these entities are core and integral to WFC's business  strategy and operations. Their IDRs and ratings would be sensitive to the same  factors that might drive a change in WFC's IDR. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR WFC has a Support Rating (SR) of '5' and Support Rating Floor (SRF) of 'NF'. In  Fitch's view, the probability of support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not  incorporate any support.  Wells Fargo Bank International has a support rating of '1', which is an  institutional support rating, and indicates that there is a high probability  that WFC would provide support to Wells Fargo Bank International, which is  domiciled in Ireland.  RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT While it is difficult to quantify the potential reputational damage to the  company's franchise, Fitch will be monitoring whether notable deterioration is  observed in deposits, account openings, primary checking customers, or wealth  and investment management client assets. WFC's ratings could be impacted as the  strength of its franchise is an important rating driver. Further, outsized  earnings decline relative to peers may also point to an impact to the franchise  from recent events, which could also have negative rating implications.  Fitch expects any further fines or litigation costs will be manageable in the  context of the company's superior earnings profile. However, failure to maintain  earnings at above peer levels will pressure WFC's ratings, as its earning  profile is one of the key rating drivers. The strength of the earnings stream  provides for solid capital generation capabilities, which will help absorb  unexpected losses. WFC has already announced the elimination of product sales  goals in retail banking, effective Oct. 1, 2016. It is unclear what implications  a potentially cautious approach to sales throughout the organization may cause  for WFC's revenues.  WFC's ratings may also be impacted by an observable shift in its strategy to  higher-risk activities. Fitch is sensitive to a shift in the bank's risk  appetite given external earnings pressures stemming from the need to hold more  long-term debt for the proposed TLAC rule or from the need to hold higher  capital levels given its G-SIB surcharge.  If WFC were to meaningfully increase its capital markets activities to a size in  line with those of other large trading banks or be on a trajectory to do so,  there may be negative rating implications given the increased volatility and  risk associated with trading activities, although Fitch views this as unlikely  over the rating horizon. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for WFC and its operating companies' subordinated debt, trust  preferred securities, and preferred stock are sensitive to any change to WFC's  VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to WFC's  long- and short-term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should WFC's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  The IDRs and ratings of Wells Fargo Canada Corp., Wells Fargo Bank  International, and Wells Fargo Securities International Limited are sensitive to  the same factors that might drive a change in WFC's IDR. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since WFC's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  Additionally, due to the linkage in ratings between WFC and Wells Fargo Bank  International, if Wells Fargo Bank International were to become less  strategically important to WFC, its ratings may be impacted.

1551,WFC,Chevron supports director Stumpf despite Wells Fargo morass,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) on Monday said it stands behind John Stumpf, a member of its board and the chief executive of bank Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), despite growing concerns about his leadership during a customer service scandal. Pressure has mounted on Stumpf in recent days to resign as CEO of Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. bank by deposits, after revelations the bank for years opened checking, savings and credit card accounts without customer approval to satisfy managers’ demands for new business.     Lawmakers of both major U.S. political parties in Congress have excoriated Stumpf, accusing him of creating a culture in which such a practice could thrive. Earlier this month Stumpf resigned from an advisory role at the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Chevron executives had cited his experience and reputation as a major benefit to its shareholders when recommending him to the board. The company’s board also noted his position at the Fed when it nominated him to the board. “John (Stumpf) is a valued member of our board,” Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said in an emailed statement to Reuters. “Given the investigations that are underway, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.”     Stumpf joined the 10-person Chevron board in 2010, the same year he became chairman of the San Francisco-based bank and three years after he became its CEO. Both companies are headquartered in California’s Bay Area and are roughly 35 miles (55 km) apart.   Stumpf also is a director at retailer Target Corp (TGT.N), which declined to comment on whether he will remain on its board.  At Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil and natural gas producer, Stumpf serves on board committees that oversee corporate governance and executive compensation. Chevron does not hold any meaningful stake in Wells Fargo.

1553,WFC,Chicago latest to sanction Wells Fargo for defrauding customers,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Chicago City Council on Wednesday approved a one-year suspension for Wells Fargo & Co from city business because of its scandal over phony accounts, joining the states of Illinois and California in punishing the bank. The ban includes bond underwriting, brokerage, trustee and other services the bank has provided to the city. Wells Fargo has earned $19.5 million in fees from Chicago since 2005. Wells Fargo staff opened checking, savings and credit card accounts without customer approval for years to satisfy managers’ demand for new business, according to a $190 million settlement with U.S. regulators and California prosecutors reached on Sept. 8. The bank said it has fired 5,300 employees over the issue. “I hope this action by the city of Chicago will echo around the nation and make it clear to other institutions this conduct is unacceptable,” said Alderman Edward Burke, who heads the council’s finance committee. Illinois penalized the bank earlier this week while California announced a 12-month sanction against Wells Fargo, that state’s oldest financial institution, on Sept. 28. California replaced Wells Fargo as a lead underwriter on two bond sales in the wake of its decision. On Wednesday, Wells Fargo said it would continue to serve Chicago customers and support non-profit community agencies, educational institutions and foundations. “Wells Fargo is disappointed that the Chicago City Council has chosen to suspend a relationship with one of the nation’s safest and strongest financial institutions at a time when the city needs access to dependable financial partners,” the bank said in a statement. Following the vote, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters: “The city’s disappointed in Wells Fargo.” Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner’s office, which included Wells Fargo in a pool of senior underwriters for bond sales, said on Sunday the state would not be using the bank for debt deals “until further notice.” Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs on Monday suspended $30 billion in state investment activity with the bank. Those activities include investments in Wells Fargo debt and bank broker/dealer services. Also on Wednesday, Connecticut’s state treasurer Denise Nappier told Reuters in a statement that Morgan Stanley was added as a co-bookrunner for an October bond sale because of troubles at Wells Fargo. “The addition of Morgan Stanley ... was made in an abundance of caution to help ensure the success of the sale,” the statement said. “Wells Fargo had been assigned as the sole bookrunner prior to the recent revelations of regulatory actions against the bank.” In addition to outright sanctions, the states of Massachusetts and Oregon, as well as the city of New York, have  said they would press for reforms at the bank, await results of investigations while also reviewing their business relationship with the firm.

Wells Fargo staff opened checking, savings and credit card accounts without customer approval for years to satisfy managers’ demand for new business, according to a $190 million settlement with U.S. regulators and California prosecutors reached on Sept. 8. The bank said it has fired 5,300 employees over the issue. “I hope this action by the city of Chicago will echo around the nation and make it clear to other institutions this conduct is unacceptable,” said Alderman Edward Burke, who heads the council’s finance committee. Illinois penalized the bank earlier this week while California announced a 12-month sanction against Wells Fargo, that state’s oldest financial institution, on Sept. 28. California replaced Wells Fargo as a lead underwriter on two bond sales in the wake of its decision. On Wednesday, Wells Fargo said it would continue to serve Chicago customers and support non-profit community agencies, educational institutions and foundations. “Wells Fargo is disappointed that the Chicago City Council has chosen to suspend a relationship with one of the nation’s safest and strongest financial institutions at a time when the city needs access to dependable financial partners,” the bank said in a statement. Following the vote, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told reporters: “The city’s disappointed in Wells Fargo.” Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner’s office, which included Wells Fargo in a pool of senior underwriters for bond sales, said on Sunday the state would not be using the bank for debt deals “until further notice.” Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs on Monday suspended $30 billion in state investment activity with the bank. Those activities include investments in Wells Fargo debt and bank broker/dealer services. Also on Wednesday, Connecticut’s state treasurer Denise Nappier told Reuters in a statement that Morgan Stanley was added as a co-bookrunner for an October bond sale because of troubles at Wells Fargo. “The addition of Morgan Stanley ... was made in an abundance of caution to help ensure the success of the sale,” the statement said. “Wells Fargo had been assigned as the sole bookrunner prior to the recent revelations of regulatory actions against the bank.” In addition to outright sanctions, the states of Massachusetts and Oregon, as well as the city of New York, have  said they would press for reforms at the bank, await results of investigations while also reviewing their business relationship with the firm.

1567,WFC,U.S. SEC questioned Wells Fargo about cross-selling in 2014,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission raised questions about Wells Fargo & Co’s  aggressive cross-selling in late 2014, according to regulatory paperwork, almost two years before officials settled with the bank for opening phony accounts. In December 2014, the SEC asked Wells Fargo to detail how it tallied the many accounts that one customer might open. “Your cross-sell program is a key element that management believes will help Wells Fargo meet its strategic goals,” reads the letter from Christian Windsor, an SEC attorney in the Division of Corporation Finance. “Please provide us with an explanation of the methodology you use to calculate the products per household.” The same letter asks Wells Fargo to explain how it measured cross-selling success in the past. Wells Fargo’s Controller Richard Levy responded to the regulator on Jan. 12, 2015, saying that its methods to measure cross-selling “remained consistent” over the past five years. The bank wanted savings accounts, individual retirement accounts or other products that “have the potential for revenue generation and long-term viability,” the bank wrote. Last month, federal banking regulators ordered Wells Fargo to pay $190 million to settle civil charges that it had opened personal accounts without customer say-so to satisfy managers’ demand for new business. The SEC letter makes no mention of how unauthorized accounts might affect cross-selling metrics. By early 2015, Wells Fargo had fired several thousand employees for the opening of unauthorized accounts. Federal prosecutors and other U.S. agencies are now probing the bank, sources have said. It is unclear exactly what prompted the SEC’s Corporation Finance Division, which reviews company filings, to ask questions about cross-selling and whether the SEC was satisfied with the response. An SEC spokesman declined to comment. Last month, several U.S. Senate Democrats called on the SEC to investigate whether Wells Fargo misled investors by failing to disclose what they called “widespread fraud.” In a separate letter in October 2007, the SEC asked Wells Fargo about its formula for compensating executives. The bank said cross-selling success could mean higher pay. “Wells Fargo has designed its management reporting system and goal-setting process to facilitate and reward these behaviors,” the bank wrote the SEC in October 2007.

1573,WFC,Wells Fargo complaints show flaws in federal whistleblower program,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) general manager Claudia Ponce de Leon filed a whistleblower complaint in December 2011 with federal labor regulators, alleging she was fired for telling superiors about employees opening unauthorized accounts.  Nearly five years later, she has not been interviewed by investigators at the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), said her attorney Yosef Peretz. Her complaint claiming retaliation by Wells Fargo for reporting potential misconduct is one of several dozens filed against the bank over the last 14 years, Reuters has found. Their existence shows U.S. government regulators are still not meeting targets set by law — a problem that was also flagged in a critical internal report issued in September 2015. As of Oct. 6, the agency had yet to close out 34 of the 91 complaints it has received since fiscal year 2002 from Wells Fargo employees alleging they faced retaliation after reporting potential wrongdoing, according to department data obtained through a Reuters public records request.    The department did not disclose details of the claims or the dates they were filed, and it remained unclear how many were related to the ongoing scandal involving Wells staffers opening as many as 2 million accounts without customer permission. It is also unclear how those 91 complaints against Wells Fargo compares with other corporations.  The bank last month agreed to pay $190 million in fines and customer restitution in a settlement with the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and other regulators.  In late September, Reuters identified Ponce de Leon and at least four other former Wells Fargo employees who reported to OSHA between 2009 and 2014 that they were fired for raising concerns about the opening of unauthorized accounts and credit cards. Of the five OSHA complaints seen by Reuters, Ponce de Leon’s case has been pending since December 2011, and another 2014 case was initially dismissed by an OSHA investigator on grounds that were later reversed on appeal by a Labor Department administrative law judge. The bank ultimately reached a settlement with the employee in 2015. The three other complaints - one in 2009 and two in 2010 - were transferred to state and federal courts, respectively.  One employee of the Labor Department involved with the cases  has since filed his own whistleblower claim against the agency, alleging his office has a history of mishandling cases. His complaint does not reference the Wells Fargo complaints specifically.  “It’s absolutely outrageous that whistleblowers contacted OSHA as early as 2009 about potential fraud at Wells Fargo, and yet these government bureaucrats failed to do their job,” said    Sen. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican who has been looking into how Wells Fargo’s sales practices have impacted small business owners.    Labor Department Secretary Thomas Perez said last month that the department has launched a “top-to-bottom” review of prior Wells Fargo whistleblower complaints.  Agency spokesman Jesse Lawder said it is the department’s policy not to comment on specific whistleblower cases, but said the review aims to “ensure whistleblowers receive the protections and remedies afforded them.” Richele Messick, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, could not comment on individual cases, but said the bank “does not tolerate retaliation against team members who report their concerns and will take measures to protect team members from retaliation.”  From fiscal year 2005 through 2015, less than two percent of all whistleblower complaints filed with OSHA were won on the merits, federal statistics show. The rest were either settled, dismissed or transferred to federal courts.    Lawyers who represent whistleblowers say OSHA investigators face challenges. One  problem is the “crushing case load,” which can lead to significant delays, said attorney Jason Zuckerman. OSHA, which received 3,288 whistleblower cases in fiscal year 2015, currently has 88 full-time investigators across the country in 10 regional offices. OSHA refers whistleblower complaints to the relevant federal regulators to investigate. But the office does not always refer them promptly, or sometimes at all, the Labor Department’s inspector general found last year. An earlier audit in September 2010 found that 80 percent of complaints it reviewed were not properly investigated, meaning OSHA staff did not take steps such as interviewing the employee, obtaining a witness list or allowing the employee to refute the employer’s defense.    The subsequent audit in September 2015 noted improvements, finding that 18 percent of complaints reviewed failed to meet certain investigative criteria.    Still, it also found that 72 percent of all of OSHA’s investigations were not performed within the 30, 60 or 90-day time frames specified by various whistleblower protection laws.  OSHA disputed some of those findings at the time, saying the audit relied on “inaccurate data” to determine how well it referred cases to other regulators. Labor Department spokeswoman Amanda McClure said OSHA’s practice is to send copies of complaints when it receives them and its findings at the conclusion of the investigation to either the Securities and Exchange Commission or the CFPB, depending on which federal whistleblower law applies. It is not clear whether OSHA, which received complaints of the unauthorized account openings at Wells Fargo dating at least as far as 2009, referred the matters to federal banking regulators, such as the CFPB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  The CFPB, a new agency launched in July 2011, has said it did not start investigating the issue until it received tips from whistleblowers in mid-2013.    The OCC has said it first learned about the issues after it  received a “small number” of complaints from consumers and bank employees in March 2012. Those complaints and media reports in December 2013 led the regulator to step up its supervision of Wells Fargo. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on whether OSHA had referred the complaints about Wells Fargo’s sales practices.     A CFPB spokesman declined to comment on whether the office had received any OSHA referrals involving Wells sales abuses. Darrell Whitman - a former OSHA investigator in the San Francisco office from 2010-2015 - was assigned to three of the five cases examined by Reuters from former Wells Fargo employees alleging retaliation for reporting improper sales tactics.    Whitman said he only briefly dealt with Ponce de Leon’s 2011 case before it was transferred to another investigator, and he was instructed to close the two 2010 cases because they were slated to be transferred to a federal court.  Another investigator assigned at one point to Ponce de Leon’s case, Susan Kamlet, told Reuters the case sat in a stack of other files and that her manager controlled which cases had priority. Now the former OSHA investigators are making their own claims of retaliation.  Whitman alleges he was fired for raising concerns about the agency’s mishandling of whistleblower complaints, and Kamlet says she was fired for supporting his accounts and for raising concerns about a particular case she was investigating. Whitman has since filed a whistleblower complaint of his own with the Office of Special Counsel, an office that investigates retaliation against federal employees.  His complaint is still pending.

1574,WFC,Wells Fargo complaints show flaws in federal whistleblower program,"WASHINGTON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Former Wells Fargo & Co  general manager Claudia Ponce de Leon filed a whistleblower complaint in December 2011 with federal labor regulators, alleging she was fired for telling superiors about employees opening unauthorized accounts. Nearly five years later, she has not been interviewed by investigators at the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), said her attorney Yosef Peretz. Her complaint claiming retaliation by Wells Fargo for reporting potential misconduct is one of several dozens filed against the bank over the last 14 years, Reuters has found. Their existence shows U.S. government regulators are still not meeting targets set by law — a problem that was also flagged in a critical internal report issued in September 2015. As of Oct. 6, the agency had yet to close out 34 of the 91 complaints it has received since fiscal year 2002 from Wells Fargo employees alleging they faced retaliation after reporting potential wrongdoing, according to department data obtained through a Reuters public records request. The department did not disclose details of the claims or the dates they were filed, and it remained unclear how many were related to the ongoing scandal involving Wells staffers opening as many as 2 million accounts without customer permission. It is also unclear how those 91 complaints against Wells Fargo compares with other corporations. The bank last month agreed to pay $190 million in fines and customer restitution in a settlement with the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and other regulators. In late September, Reuters identified Ponce de Leon and at least four other former Wells Fargo employees who reported to OSHA between 2009 and 2014 that they were fired for raising concerns about the opening of unauthorized accounts and credit cards.    Of the five OSHA complaints seen by Reuters, Ponce de Leon’s case has been pending since December 2011, and another 2014 case was initially dismissed by an OSHA investigator on grounds that were later reversed on appeal by a Labor Department administrative law judge. The bank ultimately reached a settlement with the employee in 2015. The three other complaints - one in 2009 and two in 2010 - were transferred to state and federal courts, respectively. One employee of the Labor Department involved with the cases  has since filed his own whistleblower claim against the agency, alleging his office has a history of mishandling cases. His complaint does not reference the Wells Fargo complaints specifically. “It’s absolutely outrageous that whistleblowers contacted OSHA as early as 2009 about potential fraud at Wells Fargo, and yet these government bureaucrats failed to do their job,” said    Sen. David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican who has been looking into how Wells Fargo’s sales practices have impacted small business owners. Labor Department Secretary Thomas Perez said last month that the department has launched a “top-to-bottom” review of prior Wells Fargo whistleblower complaints. Agency spokesman Jesse Lawder said it is the department’s policy not to comment on specific whistleblower cases, but said the review aims to “ensure whistleblowers receive the protections and remedies afforded them.” Richele Messick, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, could not comment on individual cases, but said the bank “does not tolerate retaliation against team members who report their concerns and will take measures to protect team members from retaliation.” From fiscal year 2005 through 2015, less than two percent of all whistleblower complaints filed with OSHA were won on the merits, federal statistics show. The rest were either settled, dismissed or transferred to federal courts. Lawyers who represent whistleblowers say OSHA investigators face challenges. One  problem is the “crushing case load,” which can lead to significant delays, said attorney Jason Zuckerman. OSHA, which received 3,288 whistleblower cases in fiscal year 2015, currently has 88 full-time investigators across the country in 10 regional offices. OSHA refers whistleblower complaints to the relevant federal regulators to investigate. But the office does not always refer them promptly, or sometimes at all, the Labor Department’s inspector general found last year. An earlier audit in September 2010 found that 80 percent of complaints it reviewed were not properly investigated, meaning OSHA staff did not take steps such as interviewing the employee, obtaining a witness list or allowing the employee to refute the employer’s defense. The subsequent audit in September 2015 noted improvements, finding that 18 percent of complaints reviewed failed to meet certain investigative criteria. Still, it also found that 72 percent of all of OSHA’s investigations were not performed within the 30, 60 or 90-day time frames specified by various whistleblower protection laws. OSHA disputed some of those findings at the time, saying the audit relied on “inaccurate data” to determine how well it referred cases to other regulators. Labor Department spokeswoman Amanda McClure said OSHA’s practice is to send copies of complaints when it receives them and its findings at the conclusion of the investigation to either the Securities and Exchange Commission or the CFPB, depending on which federal whistleblower law applies. It is not clear whether OSHA, which received complaints of the unauthorized account openings at Wells Fargo dating at least as far as 2009, referred the matters to federal banking regulators, such as the CFPB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The CFPB, a new agency launched in July 2011, has said it did not start investigating the issue until it received tips from whistleblowers in mid-2013. The OCC has said it first learned about the issues after it  received a “small number” of complaints from consumers and bank employees in March 2012. Those complaints and media reports in December 2013 led the regulator to step up its supervision of Wells Fargo. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on whether OSHA had referred the complaints about Wells Fargo’s sales practices. A CFPB spokesman declined to comment on whether the office had received any OSHA referrals involving Wells sales abuses. Darrell Whitman - a former OSHA investigator in the San Francisco office from 2010-2015 - was assigned to three of the five cases examined by Reuters from former Wells Fargo employees alleging retaliation for reporting improper sales tactics. Whitman said he only briefly dealt with Ponce de Leon’s 2011 case before it was transferred to another investigator, and he was instructed to close the two 2010 cases because they were slated to be transferred to a federal court. Another investigator assigned at one point to Ponce de Leon’s case, Susan Kamlet, told Reuters the case sat in a stack of other files and that her manager controlled which cases had priority. Now the former OSHA investigators are making their own claims of retaliation. Whitman alleges he was fired for raising concerns about the agency’s mishandling of whistleblower complaints, and Kamlet says she was fired for supporting his accounts and for raising concerns about a particular case she was investigating. Whitman has since filed a whistleblower complaint of his own with the Office of Special Counsel, an office that investigates retaliation against federal employees. His complaint is still pending.

1576,WFC,Old problems overshadow new era at Wells Fargo,"(Recasts with share moves, comment) By Dan Freed (Reuters) - The Tim Sloan era has begun at Wells Fargo  but the old problems remain. The newly installed chief executive faces a plethora of challenges following a sales practices scandal that felled his predecessor John Stumpf. He needs to restore the bank’s reputation after revelations that staff opened as many as two million accounts without customers’ knowledge to meet internal sales goals and he has to navigate a litany of federal and state investigations arising from those revelations. Wall Street will be his first port of call when he presents  third-quarter results on Friday. Investors are seeking reassurance that a suddenly chastened Wells Fargo can rebuild its reputation and retain profits while overhauling the hard-charging sales culture at the heart of the scandal over unauthorized accounts. Sloan’s nearly 30 years with Wells, largely spent on the corporate and institutional side of the bank, and his moderate temperament make him an experienced pair of hands. But as chief operating officer of the bank since November 2015, he had oversight over Wells’ retail division where the unauthorized accounts were created, some of them during his tenure as COO. Such proximity will make it difficult to silence critics in Washington who are also investigating the scandal and have said it proves that some large banks should be broken up. “I remain concerned that incoming CEO Tim Sloan is also culpable in the recent scandal, serving in a central role in the chain of command that ought to have stopped this misconduct from happening,” said Maxine Waters, the top Democrat of the House Financial Services Committee, in a statement. Wells’ shares gave back the gains accrued on Wednesday in after-hours trading when Stumpf’s departure was announced and were last down nearly two percent to $44.47. The stock is nearly 11 percent below the level it was trading at before the scandal broke. Wall Street is trying to get a handle on what a long list of probes and lawsuits regarding the bank’s opening of unauthorized customer accounts will ultimately cost. So far the tab has been relatively small: Wells agreed to a $190 million settlement last month, representing less than 1 percent of its annual earnings. But that deal itself led to a range of other inquiries the San Francisco-based bank is now contending with. Wells Fargo is expected to say how much money it has set aside for legal costs it can reasonably predict when management discusses results on Friday. At least nine separate regulators, prosecutors, enforcement agencies and congressional committees appear to be looking into the bank’s actions, according to a Sept. 26 Bernstein Research report. That comes in addition to private lawsuits from shareholders, customers and former workers. Wells’ settlement on Sept. 8 with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and a Los Angeles prosecutor revealed that the bank fired 5,300 employees for improper practices and is now working to retool risk-management protocol as well as pay incentives and training for workers. Former employees have described a pressure-cooker sales culture inside the bank where managers had browbeat staff into hitting aggressive daily sales quotas, which in turn led some workers to create unauthorized accounts. As government authorities examine Wells Fargo, it is likely they will find abuses in other parts of the bank beyond retail customers, said Harvey Pitt, founder of consulting firm Kalorama Partners and a former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “The damage to customers could be much more significant,” said Pitt. Earlier this month, Reuters reported a probe by U.S. Senator David Vitter has found 10,000 small business customers were also victims of improper practices. A Wells Fargo spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. It is difficult to estimate the total cost of the probes and litigation Wells will face over the unauthorized accounts, analysts said. Some matters could drag on for years before being resolved, and there are a range of possible outcomes. Even so, most analysts have cut profit forecasts for Wells Fargo, citing fallout from the scandal. The average estimate for Wells Fargo’s 2017 net income is now $20.8 billion, down $300 million since Sept. 7, according to Thomson Reuters data. State and local municipalities including Illinois, California, Seattle and Chicago have publicly cut ties with Wells. While some analysts expect other government entities to make similar moves, the impact on Wells Fargo’s revenues appears immaterial at this point. Less than 1 percent of Wells Fargo revenue comes from working with local governments, non-profit hospitals and universities, according to a presentation the bank made to investors earlier this year. The bank has also lost some retail customers, though Wells is still opening more accounts than it is closing, senior executives said on an internal call on Monday that was reported by the Wall Street Journal.

1579,WFC,RPT-Wells Fargo's new CEO faces immediate test,"(Repeats for wider distribution) By Dan Freed NEW YORK, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Tim Sloan will not have much time to prepare his pitch for Wall Street. The newly installed chief executive of Wells Fargo & Co  will present third-quarter results on Friday, less than 48 hours after replacing John Stumpf at the helm of the bank. Investors are seeking reassurance that Wells Fargo can rebuild its reputation and retain profits while overhauling the hard-charging sales culture at the heart of a scandal over unauthorized accounts. Sloan’s nearly 30 years with Wells, largely spent on the corporate and institutional side of the bank, and his moderate temperament make him a safe pair of hands. But as chief operating officer of the bank since November 2015, he had oversight over Wells’ retail division, where employees opened up to 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge, some of them during his tenure as COO. Much of his success will depend on how he navigates the demands of Wall Street for growing returns with the political and public clamor for change. “The fact they have named him CEO indicates to me that he has at least passed some litmus test about his part in all of this and indicates to me that there was little or no part,” said Nancy Bush, an analyst with NAB Research, which owns Wells shares. “I know Tim, he has vast experience in every part of Wells Fargo and yes, I think he is the right man.” Wall Street is trying to get a handle on what a long list of probes and lawsuits regarding the bank’s opening of unauthorized customer accounts will ultimately cost. So far the tab has been relatively small: Wells agreed to a $190 million settlement last month, representing less than 1 percent of its annual earnings. But that deal itself led to a range of other inquiries the San Francisco-based bank is now contending with. Wells Fargo is expected to say how much money it has set aside for legal costs it can reasonably predict when management discusses results on Friday. At least nine separate regulators, prosecutors, enforcement agencies and congressional committees appear to be looking into the bank’s actions, according to a Sept. 26 Bernstein Research report. That comes in addition to private lawsuits from shareholders, customers and former workers. “I don’t think there will be a surprise to the downside in terms of the legal cost. The surprise will be that it’s more than anyone suspects right now,” said Michael Holland, president of Holland & Co, which manages $5 billion worth of investments. Wells’ settlement on Sept. 8 with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and a Los Angeles prosecutor revealed the bank had opened as many as 2 million accounts in retail customers’ names without their permission. The bank fired 5,300 employees for improper practices and is now working to retool risk-management protocol as well as pay incentives and training for workers. Former employees have described a pressure-cooker sales culture inside the bank where managers had browbeat staff into hitting aggressive daily sales quotas, which in turn led some workers to create unauthorized accounts. Khalid Taha, a former Wells Fargo personal banker who left the bank in July after suing them over sales pressures, said Sloan did not represent a new era. “Wells Fargo’s problems go from top to bottom,” he said. “Sloan is part of that problem. I can’t see him as a solution.” As government authorities examine Wells Fargo, it is likely they will find abuses in other parts of the bank beyond retail customers, said Harvey Pitt, founder of consulting firm Kalorama Partners and a former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “The damage to customers could be much more significant,” said Pitt.

1580,WFC,Commentary: Why the Wells Fargo bank scandals would be a step up for some consumers,"The Wells Fargo scandal over the bank’s opening fake credit card and bank accounts for unwitting customers continues to stoke populist outrage.   There’s viral footage of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts berating Wells Fargo chief executive and board chairman John Stumpf during a Senate hearing. He blamed $12-an-hour employees for the entire mess. Stumpf weathered another grilling, this one in the House of Representatives. But he abruptly resigned on Wednesday.  Saturday Night Live pivoted off the scandal with a sly musical parody of the Broadway classic The Music Man. But the arriving Wells Fargo wagon that excited River City townspeople sing about in the SNL version is carrying financial instruments -- not musical ones for the new band. This Wells Fargo man is bringing bank accounts, credit cards and predatory loans.  Federal regulators say Wells Fargo’s real life sales practices created a pressure-cooker bank culture in which employees strived to meet stiff quotas by opening phantom accounts for customers without first gaining their permission. Some customers only learned about their phony accounts when they were charged penalty fees or were contacted by debt collectors. In response, Wells fired 5,300 low-salaried workers, and the government slapped it with a record $185 million in fines.  For some Americans, however, such shady financial practices aren’t that surprising. They seem all-too similar to the frustrations they face daily in trying to manage their money.  This is the world of America’s unbanked and underbanked. The nearly 90 million people who have little or no connection to mainstream financial institutions and who often lack emergency savings and credit histories. Hidden fees, undisclosed loan terms and unexpected charges are standard features of their financial lives.  Wells’ misdeeds, which so angered Congress, pale in comparison to the predatory nature of the financial services many working-class borrowers must rely on, including installment loans with 300 percent interest rates or quick cash tied to a car title. They are often pushed deeper into debt as they turn to online loans, prepaid debit cards, payday loans, car-title loans, pawnshops or check-cashing stores that can charge punishing fees. Yet they don’t have a lot of safe, inexpensive consumer-loan alternatives. Prepaid cardholders have been complaining for the past five years about high fees and problems with protecting their accounts. Last week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau came out with new rules to protect cardholders, which require issuers to disclose fees more clearly and to limit losses to consumers if their cards are lost or stolen.  The cards, which have exploded in popularity in the past few years, are sold online or in stores like 7-Eleven and Target. Customers load money onto the cards and use them in place of a checking account. People who are regularly charged bank-overdraft fees often opt to use the cards instead.  But in two separate incidents over the past year, consumers were temporarily locked out of their accounts because of a technical glitch. Users of a Wal-Mart-branded prepaid card and the RushCard, which was launched by hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, were unable to gain access to their money for a week or longer in some cases. Finally, cardholders took to social media to complain that they couldn’t pay for food or gas.  Now imagine the reaction if middle-class consumers had trouble withdrawing cash from bank ATMs for more than a week.  That’s not the only problem with prepaid cards. Consumers need to double-check that their cards carry government-backed insurance, something bank customers can take for granted. They also may not realize that some prepaid issuers charge $3 to speak to a customer service representative, or even to check a card’s remaining balance at an ATM.  The Wells scandal has led many to call for stronger consumer protection for banking customers. Advocates have for years been seeking basic safeguards for people who rely on a prepaid card, given that it lacks many financial protections that are standard for checking accounts and bank debit and credit cards.  The new CFPB rules help to bring the cards “out of the shadows,” as Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, put it.  But not entirely. The Washington Post noted that the financial protection bureau did not require all prepaid card companies to insure funds with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Instead, they just have to warn consumers when funds aren’t insured.  The rules, which take effect in October 2017, don’t address the kinds of technical outages that customers experienced with the RushCard and others, according to the Post. Glitches hit prepaid cardholders harder because they usually don’t have another credit card to pull out of their wallet. Their money is frozen until the outage is fixed.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is also moving to regulate payday and other consumer loans. When borrowers take out an online payday loan, for example, they often don’t realize they could be charged unexpected fees, or perhaps lose their bank account entirely if they fall behind on payments.  When a payment is late, payday lenders are able to deduct money directly from a borrower’s bank account. But payments are often late because borrowers are short of cash. The result is that half of online borrowers wind up with an average of $185 in bank overdraft fees on their accounts, a recent report found, because at least one lender’s debit attempt fails.  Other ideas are being considered. The United States Postal Service, according to one proposal, could begin to provide basic banking and financial services. This program would both help the underbanked and revive the many struggling post offices across the nation.    Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont supported this plan during the primaries. It now is part of the Democratic Party platform.  People who are totally unbanked amount to some 15 percent of all consumers, or 37 million adults, which is just shy of California’s population, Pew Charitable Trusts found. Estimates of all underserved consumers, including those with bank accounts but who also rely on check cashers and pawnshops, range as high as 88 million.  It’s harder to measure what they pay for living on the financial margins.

1582,WFC,"Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf quits, replaced by Tim Sloan","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s veteran chairman and chief executive officer, John Stumpf, abruptly departed on Wednesday bowing to  pressure over its sales tactics that has damaged the bank’s reputation and put Wall Street under renewed scrutiny. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said Stumpf, 63, was retiring and would be replaced as chief executive by President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan, 56. The bank is splitting the role of chairman and CEO with Stephen Sanger, its lead director, becoming chairman. Stumpf’s exit leaves Sloan with a steep challenge in rebuilding its reputation and overhauling its hard-charging sales culture without gutting profits. The new CEO will also contend with ongoing regulatory investigations and private litigation. The departure is a stunning reversal of fortune for Stumpf, who successfully navigated Wells through the financial crisis and built it into the world’s most valuable bank with a focus on Main Street-style lending that was the envy of Wall Street. “I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside,” he said in a statement. The bank’s shares, which have slumped in the wake of the scandal, rose 2 percent in after-hours trading after the bank announced Stumpf’s exit. Sloan said his immediate priority was to restore trust in the bank. Long considered Stumpf’s successor, Sloan has spent most of his career at Wells working with corporations and institutional investors not the retail division, where the fraudulent accounts were opened. But as the former CFO, and president and COO of the company since November, he has been responsible for the entire company, including the retail bank at the heart of the scandal. Carrie Tolstedt, the woman who ran the retail division when the misconduct occurred, reported to Sloan from November of last year. She left the bank last month. “They had three goals in replacing Stumpf: speed, integrity, and competence. If you want to move very fast and find someone intimately familiar with the business, you’ve got to hire an insider,” said Peter Conti-Brown, a business ethics and law professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. “If you want to hire someone with unimpeachable integrity, that’s going to take time to find,” Conti-Brown said. Sloan will preside over the bank’s third-quarter earnings on Friday. Stumpf’s fall from grace started with a $185 million regulatory settlement between the bank, regulatory authorities and a Los Angeles prosecutor over its staff opening as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge. The misconduct, carried out by low-level branch staff to meet internal sales targets, shattered the bank’s folksy image and a raft of federal and state investigations followed. Stumpf was summoned before the U.S. Senate and faced calls for his resignation after repeatedly deferring responsibility to low level workers and decision-making authority to his board of directors. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called him a “gutless leader” who “should be criminally investigated.” A week after that hearing, he agreed to forgo $41 million in unvested stock awards. However, that was not enough and at a second hearing, some lawmakers called for the bank to be broken up. California State Treasurer John Chiang, who announced a year-long ban on state business with Wells Fargo, released a statement praising Stumpf’s resignation. “Based on his duck, dodge, and deny performance in the wake of admissions that his bank had fleeced legions of its own customers, he was not - and would never be - the change agent leader Wells Fargo so desperately needs,” Chiang said in the statement. John Thielen, who grew up with Stumpf in Piers, Minnesota where he was a year behind the future CEO in school, said he felt sorry for Stumpf. “He’s in hot water, but I think he put himself there,” Thielen told Reuters in a recent interview that preceded Stumpf’s resignation.

1584,WFC,Wells Fargo CFO says has not considered giving back recent bonuses,"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) CFO John Shrewsberry said on Friday he has not considered giving back bonuses he has earned following a scandal over unauthorized accounts. Wells Fargo, which reported third-quarter earnings on Friday, has been reeling over revelations that branch staff opened as many as 2 million accounts over several years without customers’ knowledge to meet internal sales targets. Asked during a CNBC interview whether his compensation may have been tied to hitting targets that were artificially boosted by fake accounts, Shrewsberry said the accounts did not impact revenues. “It wasn’t generating revenue and it wasn’t improving our bottom line so it didn’t work for anybody,” Shrewsberry said. The CFO added that compensation for senior executives is delayed “over the course of years,” and is “at risk [based on] the performance of the company overall.” Shrewsberry’s 2015 compensation was more than $9 million,   according to Wells Fargo’s latest proxy statement filed in March. That total included a bonus of $850,000. Senior executives who have forfeited compensation over the scandal include John Stumpf, who resigned as CEO Wednesday and gave up $41 million in stock. Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of the retail unit where the problems occurred, forfeited some $19 million in stock.

1590,WFC,WRAPUP 2-Sales scandal costs Wells Fargo; JPMorgan and Citi please Wall St,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) trounced third-quarter estimates on Friday on a sharp rebound in trading revenues while Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank. Wells Fargo is under pressure to keep its profit engine humming while dismantling the aggressive sales culture at the heart of its woes, since unlike JPMorgan and Citigroup it does not have a big trading arm. “We’re prepared for things to get worse before they get better,” Chief Executive Tim Sloan, who took over as boss on Wednesday after John Stumpf, the bank’s veteran leader, announced he was leaving amid a public furor over the scandal. Revelations that Wells’ branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge to meet internal sales targets has shattered the bank’s folksy image. Once a Wall Street darling for its ability to sell multiple products to individual customers, Wells Fargo said on Friday that new account openings had dropped sharply. New consumer checking accounts were 30 percent lower than in August, and applications for consumer credit cards fell 30 percent in September from the prior month. Wells Fargo’s staff are in a period of flux after the bank scrapped sales targets for branches last month and in a note following Sloan’s presentation, Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at KBW, said, “Management doesn’t know what the consumer bank will look like in the future.”  The bank has said the scandal will minimally affect its wealth management business and was unlikely to alter its plans to return capital to shareholders. On Friday, the state of Ohio joined a growing list of municipalities to suspend business relationships with Wells Fargo. The bank makes less than 1 percent of its revenue from working with local governments but Ohio’s decision is a blow, coming days after Stumpf, a lightning rod for much of the criticism around the scandal, had departed. Sloan must navigate federal and state investigations in coming months. The scandal has renewed left-leaning lawmakers’ attacks on Wall Street and bolstered their mission to introduce stricter oversight. While Wells Fargo’s overall profit dropped for a fourth straight quarter, net income in the third quarter topped estimates, helped in part by lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions. JPMorgan and Citi also beat expectations as bond trading roared back in the third quarter, boosted by Brexit-inspired volatility along with changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan as well as money market reforms. Banks got a fillip from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, which moved to a seven-year high during the quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings of short-term bank debt in advance of new U.S. regulations. JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said the fourth quarter so far is showing positive signs. “The momentum that I just characterized as fairly broad and fairly consistent across the (third) quarter, has somewhat continued so far,” she told journalists. JPMorgan’s after-tax income dropped 7.6 percent after recording a tax expense, compared with a rare tax benefit of $2.2 billion a year earlier. But revenues and profits both topped analysts’ estimates. Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, beat expectations for third-quarter net profit after trading revenue surged 35 percent. While net income fell 11 percent to $1.24 per share, it exceeded the average estimate of $1.16 per share. Total adjusted revenue fell 4 percent to $17.76 billion, but beat the average estimate of $17.36 billion. The strong trading performance helped U.S. financial stocks snap a three-day losing streak, with markets-focused bank shares such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) up 2 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, ahead of their results next week.  Citigroup was up over 0.8 percent in late trade after earlier rising as much as 3 percent. JPMorgan tipped into negative territory after earlier gaining as much as 2 percent. Wells Fargo was up 0.25 percent. The S&P; financial index .SPSY gained 0.85 percent. The British government’s tougher line on immigration in the wake of the Brexit vote has bankers preparing for a scenario in which London loses access to the single market, meaning they would have to move parts of their operations elsewhere in Europe. “As a result, we will be starting to build out technology systems and operations in Europe,” JPMorgan’s Lake said.

1593,WFC,Wells Fargo's wealth unit ditches 'cross-sell' measure for referred assets,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s wealth management unit has changed the way it reports cross-selling, the strategy at the heart of the scandal over its aggressive sales targets, and now reporting assets referred from bank employees. The wealth management business reported a gain of $1 billion in “referred investment assets” in the third quarter after referrals from employees in bank branches, according to corporate filings. The figure is in line with prior trends, the bank said on Friday. Cross-selling, or getting customers to buy products and services from several business lines, was previously reported as a figure that showed the average number of accounts held by a client household if that client also had retail bank accounts, like checking or savings accounts. In August 2015, the last quarter for which it was reported, the bank said the average wealth management client household had 10.52 accounts, the highest average account number of any of the bank’s business divisions.  Meanwhile, Wells Fargo said total profits dropped for the fourth straight quarter as it set aside funds for potential legal costs from a bogus-account scandal that led to its chief executive officer stepping down. The wealth business reported profit jumped 16 percent over the previous quarter to $677 million on higher asset-based fees and a greater percentage of brokers’ paychecks being deferred. Cross-selling is a widespread practice at banks and brokerages, but the affair at Wells Fargo’s community bank raised questions about whether it is appropriate to set aggressive sales targets for employees, and whether customers really need all the products offered. Massachusetts regulators recently charged Morgan Stanley with “dishonest and unethical conduct” for having pushed its brokers to sell loans to their clients.  Last quarter, Wells Fargo’s wealth and investment management unit said it was “evaluating changes in our cross-sell methodology to better align our metrics with ongoing changes in WIM’s business and products,” according to corporate filings.

1594,WFC,"UPDATE 4-Bank of America profit rises on bond trading, cost cuts","(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported its first profit increase in three quarters on Monday, foiling expectations for another drop, as bond trading surged and expenses fell. Like rivals JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading. That came as clients scrambled to reposition after Britain’s surprise June vote to leave the European Union, and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan’s cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments. On a pretax basis, quarterly profit was at its highest in a decade. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents, from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts, on average, had estimated a decline to 34 cents a share. Revenue grew 3 percent to $21.64 billion, beating the $20.97 billion expected by analysts. Net profit in Bank of America’s trading-focused Global Markets arm jumped 34 percent from a year earlier as revenue from dealing fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities surged 39 percent. Equity trading revenue fell 17 percent.   Last week, JPMorgan reported a 48 percent increase in bond trading and Citi posted a 35 percent gain. Trading in stocks rose 1 percent and fell 34 percent respectively at JPMorgan and Citi. Like Bank of America, JMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit and revenue forecasts but their net earnings declined; JPMorgan Chase & Co’s (JPM.N) by 7.6 percent, Citigroup Inc’s (C.N) by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo & Co’s (WFC.N) by 3.7 percent. Shares of Bank of America were little changed, up 0.15 percent in afternoon trading. Ahead of Monday, the stock had shed 4.9 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 2.5 percent decline in the KBW banking index .BKX. After scandal-ridden Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) separated its chief executive and chairman roles last week with the retirement of John Stumpf, Moynihan was asked during a conference call on Monday whether he expected renewed pressure to give up his dual role from regulators or shareholders. “Our lead independent director duty is as strong as anybody’s in the industry,” said Moynihan, who had faced down a shareholder vote last year over whether to split the roles. He added that he felt “comfortable” with the bank’s current governance.  Bank of America’s large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities make it particularly dependent on a rise in interest rates to boost profits. To compensate for stubbornly low interest rates, Moynihan made trimming costs a top priority, saying in July he would cut annual expenses by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $53 billion from about $58 billion in 2015. In the third quarter, non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion as headcount fell by 3 percent. Like rivals, Bank of America got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations.   Bank of America’s net interest income rose 3 percent to $10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters. Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank’s provisions rose 5.5 percent to $850 million in the quarter. Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to $1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity.  Revenue for advising on deals tumbled 19 percent as companies held off making acquisitions amid political uncertainty in the United States and Brexit-related volatility in Britain. Adjusted revenue from Bank of America’s wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to $4.38 billion, but a 6 percent drop in non-interest expenses helped to boost net income by 10 percent. The wealth business, which has been a stable source of revenue growth when trading and investment banking revenues have fluctuated, is undergoing its own changes, with a new boss, longtime executive Andy Sieg, expected to take over in 2017 and amid a regulatory overhaul of financial advice in the United States.

1596,WFC,Lack of new blood casts doubt over Wells Fargo's change plan,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co’s decision not to introduce new names onto its board or into the ranks of its senior management in the wake of a sales scandal has raised questions about whether it can truly fix the culture which caused its problems. The United States’ third-largest bank by assets has been plunged into crisis by revelations that its branch staff created as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge in order to meet internal sales targets. John Stumpf, the bank’s chairman and chief executive, left last week in response to a public outcry and the bank put Tim Sloan, a 29-year Wells Fargo veteran and Stumpf’s heir apparent, into the CEO role. Once viewed as an unambiguous asset, Sloan’s long tenure at the bank is now prompting questions about whether he has the necessary critical distance to overhaul an aggressive sales culture that allowed the misconduct to fester for years. “There’s something wrong with Wells on a cultural basis and you’d think they’d need to bring in an outsider to fix it,” said Paul Miller, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. Wells Fargo declined comment. The San Francisco-based bank has long had a reputation as a place where a tight-knit group of senior managers worked together to deliver industry-leading returns. But the recent episode has made the closeness of top executives look like a handicap. During Sloan’s first earnings call last week, Miller asked him whether the bank would bring an outsider into its executive leadership ranks.  “It’s a fair question and one we’ve been getting asked,” the new CEO replied. However, Sloan said that following recent changes, the board “is comfortable with and very supportive of the management team.” While the bank needed to make a change quickly and Sloan is a proven commodity, Columbia Business School professor William Klepper said the board should have named Sloan CEO on an interim basis so it could conduct a thorough search including outside candidates. “It’s very difficult for anyone within that organization to make a change,” Klepper said. “The last thing they might sense is the water they’re swimming in.” Klepper pointed to Lou Gerstner, a longtime American Express Co executive who came in as Chairman and CEO of International Business Machines Corp in 1993 to lead a successful turnaround of the lumbering computer giant, as the prime example in U.S. business of the value of bringing in fresh blood. Most major U.S. and European banks have seen shake-ups of top management and their boards of directors following the financial crisis of 2008. Wells Fargo, which avoided the sort of crises suffered by rivals during the financial meltdown, has seen very little change at the top, and that seems set to continue. The bank did separate the roles of chairman and chief executive following Stumpf’s departure, with Stephen Sanger, the board’s lead director, chosen as chairman. But the bank did not announce any new faces to its board, which has some of the longest-tenured members among major U.S. banks. Three of Wells Fargo’s directors have been in place since the 1990s. The trio helps put the average duration of service for a Wells Fargo director at 9.7 years, compared to 8.5 years for companies in the S&P; 500 Index, according to a report by executive search firm Spencer Stuart. There have also been questions about the wisdom of appointing Mary Mack, a former wealth management executive, to lead the retail division at the center of the scandal. The consumer bank had previously been led by Carrie Tolstedt, a 27-year Wells Fargo veteran. She left the bank last month. Mack joined Wells Fargo when it acquired Wachovia at the end of 2008. Wells Fargo declined to make Mack available for an interview.  “Can you just give us a sense why, because we’re looking for a culture shift or culture enhancement change in the business model and that’s a big ask, so I’m just wondering what you saw in her,” Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck asked Sloan last week on the earnings call. Sloan responded: “I saw an executive with decades of experience in the financial services industry and decades of experience at Wachovia and Wells Fargo, who has been through a variety of challenges in her career, and who is an incredibly effective leader.” ",10172016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wellsfargo-accounts-trust/lack-of-new-blood-casts-doubt-over-wells-fargos-change-plan-idUSKBN12H09M

1598,WFC,Massachusetts latest to bar Wells Fargo as underwriter,"(Reuters) - The state of Massachusetts will stop using Wells Fargo & Co as a bond underwriter for a year, joining a growing list of state and local governments to suspend business with the bank after revelations it opened millions of unauthorized accounts. Massachusetts Treasurer Deborah Goldberg instructed her staff late on Monday to immediately remove Wells Fargo from the state’s approved list of underwriters for a term of one year, her spokeswoman said on Tuesday. Compared with other states, Massachusetts’ exposure to the bank is “extremely limited,” but Goldberg “isn’t convinced that Wells Fargo has grasped the level of seriousness of their actions nor have they addressed systemic failures within their organization,” spokeswoman Chandra Allard said in an email. “We value the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ business and will work to earn it back,” the bank said in a statement. Last month, Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $190 million settlement over its staff opening as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge. The misconduct triggered a raft of federal and state investigations and led to the resignation last week of its chief executive and chairman, John Stumpf. Earlier this month following the scandal, Massachusetts, as well as Oregon and the city of New York, said they were reviewing their business relationships with the firm. The backlash has since widened. On Friday, Ohio said it would ban state business with Wells Fargo for a year, following the city of Chicago and the states of Illinois and California. In Massachusetts, the bank said, it employs 1,300 people and contributed $1.3 million to nonprofits and schools statewide in 2015. Its business with the state is conducted through Wells Fargo Securities, which is a separate business line from its retail banking operations.",10182016,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-accounts-massachusetts/massachusetts-latest-to-bar-wells-fargo-as-underwriter-idUSL1N1CO27C

Attorney General Kamala Harris authorized a seizure warrant against the bank that seeks customer records and other documents, saying there is probable cause to believe the bank committed felonies. The probe marks the latest setback for the bank in a growing scandal that led to the abrupt retirement of its chief executive officer, monetary penalties, compensation clawbacks, lost business and damage to its reputation. Wells Fargo spokesman Mark Folk did not immediately provide a comment in response to requests from Reuters, but was quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying the bank is “cooperating in providing the requested information.” A spokeswoman for the California Department of Justice said she could not comment on the probe. The bank’s downward spiral kicked into high gear last month. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other regulators ordered the United States’ third-largest bank by assets to pay $190 million in fines and restitution to settle civil charges that its branch staff created as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ knowledge in order to meet internal sales targets. The CFPB said that high pressure sales tactics and financial incentives fueled the fraud, which was largely carried out by low-level branch employees. About 5,300 of those employees were fired. Shortly after the civil settlement was made public, CEO John Stumpf was called to testify before Congress. Observers have widely criticized his performance, with many saying he appeared ill-prepared to deal with tough questioning by lawmakers including Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who called for his resignation and accused him of him “gutless” leadership. Last week, Stumpf resigned and was replaced by Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan. This is at least the second criminal probe to be opened into Wells Fargo since last month. In September a source told Reuters that federal prosecutors are also looking into the matter. An affidavit filed by Special Agent Supervisor James Hirt with the California Department of Justice reveals that interviews with possible victims of the fraud have already started. One victim, identified only as “Ms. B,” told the investigator that she had declined a request by a Wells Fargo teller in late 2011 or 2012 to open new accounts. But sometime in late 2013 or early 2014, she started to receive notices that she and her husband “allegedly owned on three life insurance policies held by the bank,” the affidavit says. She also told the investigator that Wells Fargo often claimed that her accounts had to be closed and reopened because of “problems” that it could never fully explain. The constant changes, she added, sometimes caused her to incur fees because her checks would bounce. Another alleged victim, identified as “Ms. C,” told the investigator she noticed the bank was transferring money from her checking account to her savings account in amounts that grew over time, from $50 to $150. The bank claimed the transfers were done as overdraft protection, but it refused to provide her bank statements when she asked to see them. The seizure warrants by the state are seeking a variety of documents from Wells Fargo, including a list of all unauthorized California customer accounts created between May 2011 and July 2015. It also seeks information about fees, charges and other costs that were incurred and the identity of all Wells Fargo employees that may have opened the accounts.",10192016,http://www.reuters.com/article/wells-fargo-accounts-california/california-launches-criminal-probe-into-wells-fargo-account-scandal-idUSL1N1CP2FV

1611,WFC,Ecuador bank's suit against Wells Fargo over cyber heist can go forward: ruling,"(Reuters) - A lawsuit by an Ecuadorean bank alleging that Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) is liable for authorizing the transfer of $12 million stolen in a 2015 cyber heist can go forward, a U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday. The decision by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan was in response to Wells Fargo’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit by Banco del Austro, which sought to hold the U.S. bank responsible for failing to halt the transfers made via the SWIFT network. The 2016 lawsuit took on new importance in the wake of this year’s heist at the Bangladesh central bank, in which cyber thieves used the SWIFT global messaging system to swipe $81 million from an account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  In addition to highlighting potential security risks inherent to such interbank transfers, Banco del Austro’s lawsuit was also seen by legal experts as a key test of whether a so-called correspondent bank - in this case Wells Fargo - could be held liable for authorizing authenticated SWIFT transfer messages. In Tuesday’s ruling Kaplan threw out breach of contract and negligence claims against Wells Fargo but denied the U.S. bank’s bid to dismiss alleged violations of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, which governs whether fund transfer security procedures are “commercially reasonable.” Kaplan said the court could not “rule as a matter of law that use of the SWIFT system, with nothing more, constituted a commercially reasonable security procedure in the context of this particular customer-bank relationship.” Wells Fargo, which has previously maintained that it properly processed the wire instructions via authenticated SWIFT messages, could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday’s ruling. Banco del Austro could also not be reached for comment.  The $12 million was stolen in January 2015 when unidentified hackers secured a Banco del Austro employee’s SWIFT logon credentials, Wells Fargo said in a February court filing. Court filings and judicial rulings show that the cyber thieves routed most of the stolen funds through 23 companies registered in Hong Kong, some of them with no apparent business activity, Reuters reported in May. Banco del Austro submitted criminal reports to police in both Hong Kong and Ecuador about the transfers, according to Hong Kong court filings. It is not clear if any progress has been made by the authorities in finding the stolen funds.
