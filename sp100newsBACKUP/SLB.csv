Strong hiring by U.S. private employers in June coupled with a larger-than-expected drop in jobless claims spurred hopes that the soft patch the U.S. economy has entered might be short, rather than lead to another recession.  Better-than-expected sales gains at retailers like Macy’s Inc (M.N), Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Target Corp (TGT.N) added to optimism.  But with unemployment still relatively high and debt issues swirling in Greece and Europe, there is a lot of uncertainty about investing, said Catherine Avery, president of Catherine Avery Investment Management in New Canaan, Connecticut.  “We’re going to have ups and downs, the data’s not going to move up in a straight line,” said Avery, who oversees about $20 million in assets. “Because of that, we’re advising clients who are still very, very scared and nervous about getting back into the market, that they should be looking toward high-quality, dividend-paying stocks.”  Avery recommended industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N), which for 54 consecutive years has increased its dividend, along with Coca Cola Co (KO.N) and oil field services company Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N).

Maris said his firm, which manages more than $200 million, normally favors mid-cap stocks, but small- and mid-caps have had a good run so he’s recommending large-cap value.  “The transition from bonds to stocks is going to be to stocks with a big dividend,” said Maris, noting how his clients are handling their investments.  “They know they’re in stocks, they know it’s a little bit riskier but in their mind’s eye they’re still getting their income every month from these nice dividends, which are approaching the yield on intermediate bonds,” he said.

3,SLB,Analysis: Underdog Weatherford chases oilfield services pack,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As the smallest of the world’s big four oilfield services players, Weatherford International (WFT.N) always seems to have something to prove.  That’s especially true now, with its stock suffering since a $500 million accounting error unearthed this year only added to the uncertainty of a separate four-year corruption probe.  Pieced together by acquisitions a decade ago, the perpetual underdog of the full-service oil patch players is also under pressure to demonstrate how its many parts can work together.  Money has poured into the sector as high oil prices boost prospects all around. Yet like industry No. 3 Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N last year, Weatherford is the “show-me” stock of the bunch, according to Dahlman Rose analyst James Crandell, meaning that investors are waiting to be convinced.  “People want to see them put some quarters on the board before they begin to give the company credit,” Crandell said.  Investors generally have a good impression of Chief Executive Bernard Duroc-Danner, the smooth-spoken economics Ph.D. who built the company, but many are tired of waiting.  More funds fully sold out of Weatherford WFT.VX in the first quarter than bought initial stakes, according to the latest data, whereas the opposite was true for rivals Baker Hughes, Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), and Halliburton Co (HAL.N).  Baker Hughes in particular was handsomely rewarded for reviving its international arm: its stock is up 61 percent in the last year, and five analysts upgraded it in the past 90 days, versus Weatherford’s 29 percent rise and no upgrades.  “Right now Weatherford’s in the doghouse a bit,” Crandell said. “But I’m confident that Weatherford will deliver given the environment I see ahead.”  North America’s outlook only seems to get better. A survey of 445 exploration and production (E&P) firms by Crandell last month found 2011 spending set to grow 22 percent in the United States and 16 percent in Canada, up from forecasts of 8 percent and 5 percent, respectively, in December.  This spending is boosting the profits of Weatherford and others, but analysts say the real potential is elsewhere.  Duroc-Danner knows this well, having spent years gearing up outside North America to prepare for a battle that pitches his outfit against rivals with deep pockets and solid reputations.  “The overseas stuff is more likely to go to the brass nameplate people, but there is more opportunity <in the United States> for lesser names,” said Milt Ezrati, market strategist at Lord Abbett, which sold 36 percent of its Weatherford shares in the first quarter, taking its stake down to 0.8 percent.  Lord Abbett also sold 14 percent of its holding in industry leader Schlumberger. Ezrati, who declined to discuss particular stocks, sees the outlook for energy prices as flat, at best.  Yet oil prices are still around $100 a barrel, giving E&P firms enough profit margin to seek reliability over the value of Weatherford, long seen as the low-cost option in services, said Doug Sheridan, head of EnergyPoint Research in Houston.  “You’ve got a situation where being the scrappy underdog can only play so long,” Sheridan added. “At some point, people look at it and say, ‘You’re just a scrappy underdog.’”  Duroc-Danner, son of a Total (TOTF.PA) exploration head, became CEO in 1990 at Energy Ventures which, after its $2.5 billion Weatherford Enterra takeover in 1998, took on the new name and went on a three-year spree that swallowed 20 firms.  Sheridan said it could be argued that the company never truly integrated all these operations into a common culture.  A key test was its much-heralded bundled service contract at Chicontepec in Mexico, where it had to scale back last year as the country curtailed some oil developments.  The company has also faced four years of scrutiny of other adventures abroad. Various U.S. agencies are probing its part in Iraq’s oil-for-food program, along with its past operations in certain sanctioned countries, including Sudan and Iran.  The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Weatherford’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) compliance and the embezzlement of $175,000 in payments to government officials in Europe, according to company filings, beyond which it cannot comment.  Dan Newcomb, founder of the FCPA practice at law firm Shearman & Sterling, said the cases tend to run about two years, but can drag on depending on the complexity and number of countries involved. Such probes from multiple agencies can be enormously distracting for a company’s management, he said.  “During the investigation, everybody’s very worried about ‘Am I going to get fingered?’ — not just people who might justifiably be worried about it,” Newcomb said.  A record $800 million FCPA settlement by Germany’s Siemens (SIEGn.DE), which took two years to resolve, is the benchmark.  “Siemens was enormously expensive, but it went to the very top of an organization in many, many countries,” Newcomb said. “This (Weatherford) isn’t at that level yet.”  Weatherford’s reputation took another hit in March when it had to adjust its results by $500 million over four years due to “material weakness” in its tax reporting.  The stock is down by a fifth since then, whereas the oil service sector .OSX has declined 4 percent in that time.  But change is afoot. The company is seeking a new top accountant and now has a chief operating officer. The promotion of Peter Fontana to COO late last year left Weatherford’s Eastern Hemisphere boss to seek “other opportunities,” but gave Dahlman Rose’s Crandell reason to believe in the turnaround.  “If the company can get its act together internationally, there’s a lot more upside than its peers,” said Crandell, who has followed the sector for three decades. “That’s a bet I’d be willing to make.”  ",7072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oilservices-weatherford/analysis-underdog-weatherford-chases-oilfield-services-pack-idUSTRE76661420110707

5,SLB,GE names new head of oil and gas equipment unit," GREENVILLE, S.C., July 13 (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) named Dan Heintzelman, 54, to head its fast-growing oil and gas equipment business.   He will succeed Claudi Santiago, 54, who is retiring, the largest U.S. conglomerate said on Wednesday.   Heintzelman, currently head of GE Energy Services, will become chief executive of a GE unit that played a major role in the company’s $11 billion wave of energy-related acquisitions over the past year, which included takeovers of Dresser Inc and Britain’s Wellstream Holdings.   With oil prices on the rise — U.S. crude futures CLc1 are up 30 percent over the past year — and a renewed interest in natural gas production in the United States, Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE has zeroed in on equipment sales to oilfield services companies such as Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) as a growth area.   “We think this is a platform where we’ve got some competitive advantage that can grow for a long period of time organically,” GE CEO Jeff Immelt told investors in May.

6,SLB,Halliburton profit jumps on strong U.S. demand,"NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the world’s second-largest oilfield services company, reported a forecast-topping 54 percent jump in profit on Monday as a U.S. onshore drilling boom showed no sign of cooling off.  The second-quarter results clearly demonstrate how Halliburton has benefited from its North American leadership in the pressure pumping technology that enables oil and gas producers to tap in to shale rock.  High oil prices have prompted those producers to plunge billions of dollars into developing fields such as the Eagle Ford shale in Texas, creating a tighter market for equipment that allowed Halliburton to push through price rises.  “It was both top and bottom lines, and a significant component was pricing,” said Roger Read, an analyst with Morgan Keegan & Co.  The North American boom was likely to last through 2012, helped by the move to more developments that benefit from high oil prices as natural gas drilling slows.  “What we are seeing in North America, plus the continued international recovery, will lead to even a more favorable earnings picture as we go through 2011 and beyond,” Chief Executive Dave Lesar told analysts on a conference call.  Second-quarter net profit climbed to $739 million, or 80 cents per share, from $480 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, it earned 81 cents per share, topping the average analyst estimate of 74 cents from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Second-quarter revenue rose 35 percent to $5.9 billion and came in above the average analyst forecast of $5.71 billion. (For a graphic on Halliburton versus its competitors: r.reuters.com/dyw62s )  UBS analyst Angie Sedita, who anticipates more positive earnings surprises from Halliburton driven by North America, noted that the stock traded at a discount to its peers.  Shares of industry leader Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), with far more exposure to markets beyond North America, were down 0.5 percent on Monday morning while those of Houston-based rival Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N rose along with Halliburton.  Halliburton said its margins would grow more slowly in the third quarter than in the second due to cost inflation and a slowdown in the recovery of Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling as new permits become harder to come by.  “The pace of permit issuance has slowed again and the fact that some of the initially permitted wells are nearing completion creates a risk that the Gulf recovery could slow or stall in the second half of 2011,” Lesar said.  Second-quarter activity outside North America was soft. While seasonal pickups in the North Sea and Russia lifted revenue, the Libya shutdown, delays in Iraq, rising sub-Saharan Africa costs and sluggish markets in Britain and Algeria all cut into profits in those markets. Lesar said those factors shaved 4 percentage points off Eastern Hemisphere margins.

8,SLB,Two Schlumberger workers indicted for $3 million fraud,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Two MI-SWACO staff have been indicted for defrauding their employer, the oilfield drilling fluids unit of Schlumberger Ltd, of more than $3 million.  A Houston grand jury last week returned a 10-count indictment of Jeremy Gene Dobbins, 35, and Bobby Dean Roberts, 51, U.S. Attorney Jose Angel Moreno said in a statement on Tuesday.  The indictment accuses Dobbins and Roberts of conspiring to commit wire fraud between February 2008 and June 2010, committing wire fraud and money laundering.  Dobbins, a facilities manager, and Roberts, a building operations supervisor, allegedly formed four vendor entities to submit false invoices to MI-SWACO that they then approved for more than $3.5 million in payments, the indictment said.  The men were taken into custody this week and were released on bond pending trial. Conspiracy to commit wire fraud carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, while the other counts each carry a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and up to a $500,000 fine.

10,SLB,Shell looks to avoid paying for low-value drilling," * Push against paying service firms for low-margin work   * Oil service profit margins rising again with oil prices   HOUSTON, July 21 (Reuters) - An executive at Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) sees a new Chinese partnership as an opportunity to avoid paying oilfield service companies for drilling they could do just as effectively themselves.   The venture with state-owned China National Petroleum Corp will build systems to automate repetitive drilling, with a goal of having them in the field by 2013, said Peter Sharpe, executive vice president, wells, at Shell Global Solutions International BV.   While Shell expects it will need traditional services in most instances, drilling in coalbed methane and heavy oil fields is relatively simple and can often be automated, he said.   “There are parts of our business where we think we can do better without them (service companies), and we intend to prove that,” Sharpe told a media luncheon in Houston outlining the plan, which was first unveiled last month.   The partners are putting together a Singapore-based entity to run the project, but the software-managed drilling piece is already in use in the Netherlands and North America, he said.   Scale and longevity would determine whether the approach would work on a project, which would need at least hundreds of similar wells. Apart from coal-bed methane, he also mentioned the Carbon Creek heavy oil project in Canada as a good fit.   Sharpe said the goal was to convert more of the service function from a low-volume, high-margin business to one that is high volume with low profit margins.   His speech happened to come a day before oilfield services industry leader Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) reports second-quarter results, and just days after rival Halliburton Co (HAL.N) posted a sharp increase in profits. [ID:nN1E76D23F]   The push to cut service costs is reminiscent of colorful verbal sparring a few years ago between the former Shell CEO, who called service companies “plumbers,” and Andrew Gould, the Schlumberger CEO who steps down this month.

11,SLB,UPDATE 3-Schlumberger says Kibsgaard to become CEO on Aug 1," * Kibsgaard appointed COO in February 2010   * Gould to retain chairmanship until April 2012   * Tony Isaac to become nonexecutive chairman next year   * Schlumberger shares up 1 pct ahead of results on Friday  (Adds analyst comment, background on new CEO, SAN FRANCISCO to dateline)   NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, July 21 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world’s largest oilfield services company, said on Thursday that Chief Operating Officer Paal Kibsgaard would succeed Andrew Gould as chief executive on Aug. 1.   Kibsgaard, a 43-year-old Norwegian, began his career with Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) in 1992 before joining Schlumberger in 1997 as a reservoir engineer in Saudi Arabia. He was formally introduced by Gould as the next CEO in February. [ID:nN23158951]   The succession has been closely watched since Gould has become one of the most respected leaders in the global energy industry after eight years as CEO and a 36-year career at a company, which has relationships with nearly every major oil producer.   The Briton is stepping down because he turns 65 at the end of this year. Since he took the helm in February 2003, Schlumberger’s shares have soared nearly 370 percent as the company expanded its services and geographic reach.   Simmons & Co analyst Bill Herbert said Gould did a fine job of purging the company of a litany of non-core businesses, while paying down debt and sharpening its strategic focus.   “The result has been to not only re-establish (Schlumberger) as the leading enterprise in the oil service industry, but as one of the leading enterprises in the global energy business,” Herbert wrote in a note to investors.   Kibsgaard, asked in February about what made him paranoid, said it was complacency within his company, which has a stock market value greater than rivals Halliburton Co (HAL.N), Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N and Weatherford Ltd (WFT.N) combined.   “If you are the leader in anything, and you think that staying the leader is easy and you can relax, that is a recipe for disaster,” Kibsgaard said.   Under Gould, Schlumberger has pushed to take a leading role in Iraq, where it is working with oil producers to return output to levels not seen in about a decade.   Gould will remain chairman until the annual shareholders meeting next April, when current lead independent director Tony Isaac will take over as the new nonexecutive  chairman.   Kibsgaard, who has held operational and management roles in the Middle East, Europe and the United States, became COO in February 2010 and was widely seen as the next CEO when Gould started discussing succession last October.

12,SLB,"Schlumberger quarterly results jump, shares rise","NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) beat estimates with a 64 percent jump in profit on strong U.S. demand and deepwater drilling, while international activity showed clear signs of improvement after a long wait.  Schlumberger shares rose 3 percent in early trading, as the world’s largest oilfield services company delivered its first set of market-pleasing results this year.  The stronger North American trend drove an estimate-beating 54 percent jump in earnings for rival Halliburton Co (HAL.N) this week, though Halliburton shares were little changed on Friday.  While half of Halliburton’s revenue comes from Canada and the United States, the region accounts for less than a third for Schlumberger, which sees big improvements elsewhere led by a dramatic increase in Saudi Arabian activity.  “None of the other countries are executing with the speed of Saudi. So yes, it’s going to come, but it’s not there yet,” Chief Executive Andrew Gould said on a call with analysts — his last before he retires as CEO and hands off the top job to 44-year-old Paal Kibsgaard.  Iraq is also a key factor in the improving international outlook, along with the North Sea and East Asia, he added.  Asked about Iraq, where many oil firms have found it hard to establish a foothold, Kibsgaard said it is likely to be Schlumberger’s seventh biggest out of 14 markets in the Middle East and Asia, before improving to No. 3 next year.  Oil and gas companies’ spending picked up far more quickly in North America than elsewhere this year as oil prices surged and producers rushed to tap fields rich in liquids.  Schlumberger said onshore U.S. strength and demand from the world’s deepwater regions drove second-quarter earnings, while Gulf of Mexico activity was improving after the drilling halt that followed last year’s BP Plc (BP.L) Macondo oil spill.  Second-quarter profit rose to $1.34 billion, or 98 cents a share, from $818 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier.

13,SLB,"UPDATE 4-Schlumberger quarterly results jump, shares rise"," * Q2 EPS ex-items of 87 cts vs Wall St view of 85 cts   * Revenue up 62 pct at $9.6 bln   * Sees deepwater pricing power, international improvement   * Schlumberger shares up 3 percent, Halliburton flat   * Weatherford shares up, Baker Hughes down  (Adds CEO comments from conference call, bylines)   By Matt Daily and Braden Reddall   NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, July 22 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) beat estimates with a 64 percent jump in profit on strong U.S. demand and deepwater drilling, while international activity showed clear signs of improvement after a long wait.   Schlumberger shares rose 3 percent in early trading, as the world’s largest oilfield services company delivered its first set of market-pleasing results this year.   The stronger North American trend drove an estimate-beating 54 percent jump in earnings for rival Halliburton Co (HAL.N) this week, though Halliburton shares were little changed on Friday.   While half of Halliburton’s revenue comes from Canada and the United States, the region accounts for less than a third for Schlumberger, which sees big improvements elsewhere led by a dramatic increase in Saudi Arabian activity.   “None of the other countries are executing with the speed of Saudi. So yes, it’s going to come, but it’s not there yet,” Chief Executive Andrew Gould said on a call with analysts — his last before he retires as CEO and hands off the top job to 44-year-old Paal Kibsgaard. [ID:nN1E76K08F]   Iraq is also a key factor in the improving international outlook, along with the North Sea and East Asia, he added.   Asked about Iraq, where many oil firms have found it hard to establish a foothold, Kibsgaard said it is likely to be Schlumberger’s seventh biggest out of 14 markets in the Middle East and Asia, before improving to No. 3 next year.   Oil and gas companies’ spending picked up far more quickly in North America than elsewhere this year as oil prices surged and producers rushed to tap fields rich in liquids.   Schlumberger said onshore U.S. strength and demand from the world’s deepwater regions drove second-quarter earnings, while Gulf of Mexico activity was improving after the drilling halt that followed last year’s BP Plc (BP.L) Macondo oil spill.   Second-quarter profit rose to $1.34 billion, or 98 cents a share, from $818 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier.   Leaving out one-time items, Schlumberger earned 87 cents a share from continuing operations, topping the analysts’ average forecast of 85 cents as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

14,SLB,"Baker Hughes profit surges, but outshone by rivals","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oilfield service company Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N posted slightly better-than-expected quarterly earnings, driven by rising profit margins outside North America that offset some weakness closer to home.  North American results were hurt by the usual seasonal slowdown in Canada, where the spring snow melt hampers activity, and as many Gulf of Mexico rigs served by the world’s third-largest oilfield services company remained sidelined.  Baker Hughes shares were down 0.3 percent to $79.67 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.

High oil prices have prompted energy producers to boost activity in liquids-rich shale fields in the United States, driving up prices for pressure pumping and other activities.  Baker Hughes had a solid performance outside North America, with profit margins above 13 percent, or more than a percentage point up from last quarter and nearing its 15 percent year-end target. Chief Executive Chad Deaton said more international price rises would kick in over the quarters ahead.  “The momentum is definitely building, there is no doubt about it,” said Deaton, who could see the international margin recovery cap his seven-year stint as CEO when he steps down at the end of the year.

16,SLB,Montana launches $85 million carbon storage project,"SALMON, Idaho (Reuters) - The federal government has given final approval to an $85 million, eight-year pilot project to inject a million tons of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, into underground rock formations in Montana for storage.  The Montana State University project seeks to determine whether carbon dioxide emissions from sources such as coal-fired power plants and cement production can be safely and economically captured and stored instead of being released into the atmosphere.  The Big Sky Sequestration Project comes as the U.S. Energy Department is underwriting numerous carbon capture and storage experiments aimed at reducing greenhouse gas output associated with climate change, government officials said in a statement on Tuesday.  In Montana, geologists have targeted Kevin Dome, a subterranean rock formation in the north-central part of the state that stretches for 700 square miles (1,800 sq km) and has trapped naturally occurring carbon dioxide for millions of years, said Lee Spangler, director of the carbon project and associate vice president of research for the university.  Spangler said the formation featured porous rock that would admit gas pumped in from the surface, topped by nonporous rocks that should keep the gas contained.  Development of the site, which includes drilling of injection wells, should be under way this week, with storage of the gas slated to begin in two years.  Scientists intend to monitor carbon dioxide levels to ensure the gas was not escaping and to gauge its effects on surrounding rock and water, Spangler said.  While a million tons of carbon dioxide represents just a fraction of the 7 billion tons the United States emits annually, the Montana site has the potential to store as much as a billion tons of the gas, he said.  The Montana-based project is not the largest of its kind but is vital to assessing whether such regional capture facilities are viable, Spangler said.  “The estimates of storage capacity are very generous,” he said of the dome.  With the high cost of converting carbon dioxide to other uses, research in recent years has focused on capturing and storing heat-trapping gas emissions, Spangler said.  The Montana project relies on $67 million in federal funds and $18 million in matching funds provided mostly by private partners. Those include oil and gas exploration firms like Vecta Oil and Gas, SR2020 Inc and Schlumberger.  Carbon capture and sequestration projects have not proved viable for public utilities in the absence of economic incentives, Spangler said.  Earlier this month, American Electric Power Co, one of the nation’s largest power plant operators, cited the government’s failure to put a price on emissions in its decision to shelve plans to capture carbon dioxide output from a coal-burning plant in West Virginia.

18,SLB,Mexico's Pemex lines up debut private oil tenders," * Contracts for first oil fields to be awarded on Aug. 18   * 17 companies qualified for tender   * Contracts to drill in more-mature fields by end of year   By Mica Rosenberg and Adriana Barrera   MEXICO CITY, July 29 (Reuters) - Mexico’s state oil monopoly Pemex on Friday named the list of companies qualified to bid on the country’s first-ever oil field operating contracts in a historic auction to be held in mid-August.   The list of 17 companies includes global players like Halliburton Co (HAL.N), Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), Repsol (REP.MC) and Pacific Rubiales PRE.TO as well as some smaller operators.   Pemex wants private industry to help reactivate three small oil fields in southern Mexico, the first step toward opening up the nationalized energy sector.   The company hopes outside expertise and capital will help Mexico reverse a dramatic drop in oil output.   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   For Factbox on contract auction           [ID:nN27195636]   For story on Pemex’s Q2 results           [ID:nN1E76S0D5]   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Mexico, the world’s No. 7 oil producer, lost nearly a quarter of its production capacity between 2004 and 2009 because of aging oil fields and a lack of exploration.   Significant investment by foreigners has been barred in the past, protecting national pride around the country’s oil resources expropriated by the government in 1938.   But a 2008 oil reform allowed Pemex to offer more flexible contracts that incentivize production by offering bonuses when targets are exceeded.   The idea is to roll out auctions at mature fields first and then move on to more coveted exploration in deep waters.   Twenty-seven companies were interested in the tender for the Carrizo, Magallanes and Santuario fields, after more than 50 bought information packets.   Only 17 fulfilled all the requirements.   The winners will be chosen on Aug. 18 based on who can produce a barrel of oil most cost-effectively.   There is wide international interest from oil companies eager for more access to Mexico’s energy sector. Some remain wary of bureaucratic hurdles of working with the state behemoth but others have been impressed with the advances.   “Obviously there have been some problems, but in general I would say this has been the most orderly process for production and exploration contracting in Mexico’s history,” said David Enriquez, a lawyer for one of the firms in the contest.   “The companies are very happy with the timeframes and the level of information (being provided),” he said.   Mexico relies on oil revenues to fund around a third of its budget and Pemex often operates at a loss since the government gobbles up around half of its revenues. Rising oil prices have helped Pemex turn that trend around recently.   Two debt rating agencies downgraded Mexico in late 2009, citing its heavy reliance on the declining oil industry and a lack of political will to broaden the tax base.   Although Mexico’s oil output has stabilized around 2.6 million barrels per day, a renewed decline in production could one day force Mexico to become a net oil importer.   Bigger oil players like Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), BP Plc (BP.L) did not bid on the smaller fields but are likely watching how the process unfolds.   The three blocks total just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent, a fraction of Mexico’s proven reserves of 13.8 billion barrels. If this round of contracts goes well, Pemex could attract more players for future tenders.   “The importance of this round is not the volume, it’s that this contracting model is now up and running,” Enriquez said.

The Canadian company expects high equipment utilization in western Canada and strong financial performance throughout the remainder of the year and into 2012 as a wet spring in western Canada delayed a lot of fracturing and coiled tubing work into the third and fourth quarters.	   Calfrac also raised its 2011 capital program by C$59 million to C$382 million ($396 million), of which C$38 million is expected to be spent in 2012.	   Despite North American seasonal slowdown in Canada, where the spring snow melt hampers activity, Calfrac posted a profit of C$12.1 million, or 27 Canadian cents a share, compared with a loss of C$10.3 million, or 24 Canadian cents a share, last year.	   Analysts, on average, had expected the company to post a loss of 8 Canadian cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.	   The company, which gets more than 80 percent of its revenue from North America, benefited from high levels of pressure pumping activity in the unconventional oil and natural gas plays of western Canada and the United States.	   Revenue jumped 63 percent to C$269.5 million, ahead of estimates of C$215 million.	   In the April-June quarter, U.S. crude oil prices CLc1 soared 32 percent to average $103.49 a barrel.	   The company also expects crude oil and natural gas liquids prices to remain strong, which should assure expanded capital budgets at many of its customers.     	   Calfrac’s larger North America peers like Baker Hughes  , Schlumberger Ltd and Halliburton Co  have also posted strong profits.  	   Additionally, Calfrac, which has operations in Argentina, Russia, Mexico, said it plans to commence operations in Colombia during the second half of 2011.

20,SLB,UPDATE 2-Mexico's Pemex awards historic private oil contracts," * Pemex announces private operators of mature oil fields  * First incentive-based oil contracts in Mexico’s history  * Bigger companies eyeing potential deep water projects  (Updates with quotes, size of Petrofac investment)  By Mica Rosenberg and Luis Manuel Lopez  MEXICO CITY/VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Mexico’s state oil monopoly Pemex awarded its first-ever private oil-field operating contracts on Thursday as the company seeks to kick-start foreign investment in the nationalized energy sector.  British energy services firm Petrofac (PFC.L) won the right to operate two of the three mature oil fields up for grabs, and Mexico’s Administradora en Proyectos de Campos (APC) won the third.  Petrofac, which designs, builds and maintains facilities used in extracting and processing oil and gas, will be the first foreign company to operate fields in the world’s No. 7 oil producer in more than 70 years.  The new contracts are the fruit of 2008 reforms aimed at attracting more private investment into the lumbering oil industry to bring new dynamism to the sector.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Factbox on contract auction           [ID:nN1E77H0JS]  Story on Pemex’s Q2 results           [ID:nN1E76S0D5]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  The fields total only a small fraction of Mexico’s proven reserves of 13.8 billion barrels, but Pemex is hoping strong interest in other areas, especially deep-water contracts off the Gulf of Mexico planned for next year, will help reverse a slide in production.  “This is the beginning of a new phase. We want companies to help us exploit this resource by working hand-in-hand with us,” Pemex CEO Juan Jose Suarez Coppel said after the announcement.  “With more flexible contracts ... the potential is huge,” he added at the event held in the city of Villahermosa, Tabasco, an oil-producing state on the Gulf coast.  LESSONS LEARNED  More than 50 companies bought information packets about the Carrizo, Magallanes and Santuario fields in southern Mexico to get a peak at Pemex plans, twenty-seven made bids but only 17 fulfilled all the requirements.  Even companies that did not win the contracts said they were pleased with the process.  “This was a good start for Pemex ... we are hoping this will open doors for more companies to exploit these reserves that have been passed over,” said Manuel del Villar, the director of GPA Energy, which submitted a losing bid for the Santuario area.  “This is the first round, there will be others and we learned lessons,” he said.  Mexican oil output has fallen 24 percent since a 2004 peak of 3.4 million barrels per day and a renewed slide could one day force it to become a net crude importer.  Around a third of Mexico’s budget is funded by oil revenues so the decline in production has had serious implications for the country’s financial health and was one of the reasons behind a ratings downgrade in 2009.  Nationalized since 1938 and a large source of Mexican pride, Pemex [PEMEX.UL] has managed to stabilize oil output at around 2.6 million bpd and is aiming for 3 million bpd by 2015.  Pemex has not yet discussed private involvement in its largest oil fields, Cantarell and Ku Maloob Zaap, which make up more than half the country’s production. The company has sunk billions of dollars in the complicated Chicontepec project, but with disappointing results so far. [ID:nN1E77720E]  The three mature fields are currently producing nearly 15,000 barrels of oil per day, up from output last year, and the hope is to boost production to 55,000 bpd with the outside help, Pemex said in a statement on Thursday.  “We are sure that we will be able to significantly increase the recovery of these reserves for the benefit of all Mexicans,” Carlos Morales, head of Pemex upstream operations, said.  Global players like Halliburton Co (HAL.N), Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Repsol (REP.MC) had bid for the contracts, but were out-priced. The contracts were won by the companies offering to produce a barrel of oil at the lowest cost.  Petrofac, a FTSE 100 group, offered to produce crude for $5.01 per barrel in the Magallanes and Santuario fields, well below Pemex’s maximum. APC offered $5.03 per barrel for the Carrizo field.  Petrofac said it has committed to an investment of approximately $500 million.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded Petrofac stock to “buy” on Thursday but did not mention the Mexico contracts in its research note published before the announcement.

The company has managed to stabilize oil output at around 2.6 million barrels per day but a renewed decline in production could one day force Mexico to become a net crude importer.   Pemex hopes a successful first round of contracts will attract more interest in more mature fields planned to be tendered later this year.   The winning companies — determined by who can produce a barrel of oil at the lowest cost — will be named in a closed-door session in the city of Villahermosa, Tabasco near the Gulf of Mexico coast   More than 50 companies bought information packets about the Carrizo, Magallanes and Santuario fields in southern Mexico to get a peak at Pemex plans, twenty-seven made bid but only 17 fulfilled all the requirements.   In the running are global players like Halliburton Co (HAL.N), Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), Repsol (REP.MC) and Pacific Rubiales PRE.TO.    The three areas total only a fraction of Mexico’s proven reserves of 13.8 billion barrels, but if this round of contracts goes well, Pemex could attract more players for future tenders.

23,SLB,"Exxon, Rosneft tie up in Russian Arctic, U.S.","SOCHI, Russia/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Rosneft signed an agreement to extract oil and gas from the Russian Arctic, in the most significant U.S.-Russian corporate deal since U.S. President Barack Obama began a push to improve ties.  The pact, which includes an option for Rosneft to invest in Gulf of Mexico and Texan properties, ended any hope of Britain’s BP reviving its deal with state-owned Rosneft to develop the same Arctic territory. That deal was blocked in May by the billionaire partners in another BP Russian venture.  The pact gives Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil company, access to substantial reserves in Russia, the world’s top oil producer. For Rosneft, it’s about bringing in one of the few companies capable of drilling in the harsh, deep waters of the Arctic.  Russia has shown greater willingness in the past year to secure foreign partners, even if some deals later fell apart. The Exxon announcement comes only months after the demise of a Rosneft deal with Chevron Corp for a $1 billion investment in an estimated $32 billion Black Sea project.  Analysts cited differences between Chevron and Rosneft over the choice of contractor, the joint venture’s domicile and the jurisdiction of arbitration for any business disputes.  Yet Chevron, like Royal Dutch Shell Plc, was also considered a potential partner for Rosneft’s Arctic venture.  Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin attended the Tuesday signing — in the Black Sea resort of Sochi — by Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson and Russia’s top energy official, Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin.  “New horizons are opening up. One of the world’s leading companies, Exxon Mobil, is starting to work on Russia’s strategic shelf and deepwater continental shelf,” Putin said.  Exxon and Rosneft agreed to invest $3.2 billion to develop East Prinovozemelsky Blocks 1, 2, and 3 in the Arctic Kara Sea and the Tuapse licensing block in the Black Sea.  Rosneft will own 66.7 percent and Exxon the rest of the joint venture to develop the blocks, which Exxon said were “among the most promising and least explored offshore areas globally, with high potential for liquids and gas.”  “The fact that someone with the stature of Exxon Mobil is willing to give it a stab is very significant,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, of the Baker Institute at Houston’s Rice University.  While Rosneft will tap Exxon’s expertise to open up one of the last unconquered drilling frontiers, it will also diversify further by getting a piece of some of Exxon’s U.S. developments.  “To get into Russia offshore you give up some of your domestic offshore. I think it’s a fair trade,” said Brian Youngberg, senior energy analyst at brokerage Edward Jones in St. Louis, who has a “hold” rating on Exxon shares.  It marks a big move for Exxon after it spent a year swallowing XTO — a much-criticized purchase that shifted its profile toward the depressed U.S. natural gas market. “Now Exxon Mobil is starting to look elsewhere for deals,” Youngberg said.  Analysts also said the Rosneft-Exxon agreement indicates that the reset in relations Obama sought was working to reduce the political risk for U.S. businesses operating in Russia.  “Three years ago, American companies were being excluded. Here, an American company is at the center of a flagship announcement. This deal demonstrates that reset has had a positive effect on U.S.-Russia energy relations,” said Cliff Kupchan, director of Eurasian Practice at Eurasia Group.  In explaining the deal’s significance, Myers Jaffe pointed to previous failed efforts in the past decade to foster joint energy interests. “There was a lot of disappointment on both sides,” she said. “The U.S. industry just gave up on Russia.”  Rosneft said the Kara Sea blocks contain an estimated 36 billion barrels of recoverable oil resources. Total resources are estimated at 110 billion barrels of oil equivalent — more than four times Exxon’s proven worldwide reserves.  The Black Sea block is estimated to hold 9 billion barrels of oil reserves. First drilling is planned to start in 2015, with Exxon shouldering most of the costs.  “The Russians very quickly had a Plan B, and Plan B was Exxon,” said Fadel Gheit, energy analyst at Oppenheimer & Co, referring to the quick switch to Exxon from BP.  The deal marks a turnaround in Russia for Exxon, which was widely thought to be on the verge of taking over Yukos, then Russia’s largest oil company, before Yukos’s boss, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested in 2003.  Khodorkovsky was subsequently jailed for fraud and tax evasion and Yukos’s prime assets were bought at bankruptcy auctions by Rosneft, now Russia’s industry leader and with enough reserves to cover 27 years of production.  Uncertainty persists over whether Putin or President Dmitry Medvedev will seek the presidency next March. Putin can now show off the deal as a success if he decides to run.  The transaction also marks a comeback for Sechin, who was ousted as Rosneft chairman earlier this year in a purge of state company boards ordered by Medvedev. Sechin estimated total investment in the project at $200 billion-$300 billion.  In anticipation of all the money flowing there, oilfield services companies including Schlumberger Ltd, Baker Hughes Inc and Weatherford International Ltd WFT.N> have been picking up assets in Russia.  Environmental concerns are unlikely to create barriers to oil extraction in Russia’s remote Arctic regions, if moves this year by the country’s Natural Resources Ministry to shift nature reserve boundaries are any guide.  Rosneft will be offered an equity interest in Exxon exploration projects in North America, including deepwater Gulf of Mexico and fields in Texas, as well as in other countries.  The deal thus fulfills a demand for reciprocity often made by Putin, helping Rosneft, which already works with Exxon offshore Russia’s Sakhalin island, toward its long-term goal of being a global energy major.  It was not clear whether any such investments by Rosneft would need approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment.  There is no exchange of equity in the agreement, while the BP deal called for a $16 billion share swap in which BP would have exchanged a 5 percent stake for 9.4 percent in Rosneft.  “Exxon is double or triple the size and market value of BP,” said Gheit at Oppenheimer. “So, obviously, this would be much more important for a BP than it is for Exxon.”  While Rosneft shares rose 1.4 percent in Moscow, Exxon fell slightly on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

Chief Executive Chad Deaton said he had visited China three times in the past three or four months, with many companies looking at the potential development of the country’s substantial oil and gas resources in shale rock.   Emerging oil and gas producers represented the best chance for the big three oilfield services players, which also include Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Halliburton Co (HAL.N), to expand their operations in China, he said.   Generally, Deaton saw a steady improvement in international demand leading to price increases next year as markets outside the already-strong North America region ramp up.   “I don’t see anything that’s going to slow that down,” Deaton told investors at the Barclays Capital CEO Energy-Power conference in New York on Wednesday.

Princeton Lyman, the U.S. special representative for Sudan, said the Treasury Department would soon clarify how companies may apply for U.S. licenses to enter the oil business, saying it was a priority for the U.S. government and for South Sudan.   “I’m sure we’re going to open that door, but the rules of the game are still being worked out and that is very frustrating to the South because they want American oil companies there,” Lyman told a trade briefing in Washington.   “There is a task force working on it and they will, God willing, have something soon.”   The United States imposed a series of sanctions on Sudan in 1997, accusing the government of human rights abuses and supporting terrorism, and tightened the restrictions further in 2006 over the separate conflict in Sudan’s Darfur region.   When South Sudan declared independence from the north in July, the United States said it was no longer covered by the existing sanctions regime.   But since the two countries’ oil industries are so interconnected, it has been impossible for U.S. oil companies to get a piece of the market now dominated by Chinese, Indian and Malaysian companies.   Sanctions drove out Chevron Corp (CVX.N), Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) and other Western companies, but industry sources say many are keeping their options open about reviving investments in the oil-rich African country. China National Petroleum Corp[CNPET.UL], Malaysia’s Petronas PETR.UL and India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp are among the oil firms now operating in South Sudan.   Lyman said the United States could not quickly remove the sanctions, which would require congressional approval.   But he said the Treasury Department would define new criteria for licensing oil deals that would provide only “incidental” benefits to the North, making some deals with South Sudan possible.   The South took 75 percent of the country’s 500,000 barrels a day of oil production but depends on the North to use its pipeline, port and refineries to sell oil. Experts say southern plans to connect to a pipeline in Kenya are years away.   Both sides have been unable to agree yet on how to divide oil revenues that are the lifeblood for both economies, one of a series of outstanding disputes that cloud their relationship despite the South’s peaceful secession.   Khartoum has voiced disappointment the United States has not moved on pledges to drop sanctions against it as a reward for allowing the secession to take place.   But Lyman said no U.S. move would be possible until the outstanding issues are resolved and violence stops in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states, two border states where fighting broke out between Khartoum’s troops and rebels aligned with South Sudan.   Lyman said U.S. companies could provide valuable know-how and improved technologies to South Sudan’s oil sector to extend the life of wells that some experts say risk sharp production declines within the next five years.   But he warned that U.S. interest in South Sudan’s oil opportunities was tempered by serious concerns over corruption and transparency, saying the new leaders in Juba had yet to act on pledges to put monitoring institutions in place.   “If they don’t meet that challenge, its going to be a big problem for everybody,” Lyman said.

32,SLB,FACTBOX-Key political risks to watch in Ecuador," QUITO, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The implementation of contentious justice reforms, tensions between the government and the media, and talks aimed at patching up relations with the United States are key issues to watch in Ecuador.   Leftist President Rafael Correa won a May 7 referendum on 10 reforms to overhaul the justice system and limit media ownership, as well as to ban activities such as bullfighting and gambling in casinos.   He argues the judicial overhaul is key to tackling crime, the number one worry of Ecuadoreans. But opposition leaders say the reforms are designed to give Correa more control over judicial appointments.   In early September, Correa declared a 60-day judicial “emergency” to ensure legal services while the justice system is overhauled. [ID:nN1E78410H] A process to select the members of Ecuador’s supreme court has started and should last a few weeks.   Three of the 10 reforms have to be ratified by lawmakers, and the ruling Alianza Pais coalition is scrambling to win support for them since it does not control Congress.   Lawmakers passed an anti-monopoly law in late September creating watchdogs that will control prices and foster competition. The law also bans bankers from having investments in other industries, including the media.   Ecuador sentenced three newspaper directors and a former columnist to jail in July, and fined them and the paper $40 million for libeling Correa, prompting widespread condemnation from rights groups. [ID:nN1E76K1YF]   Correa has accused the media of being corrupt and calls them “the real opposition,” while news outlets accuse the president of trying to silence media critics.   Congress is expected to pass a bill in the next few weeks to create a media watchdog that critics fear will be used to censor journalists.   Correa is part of a South American leftist alliance that includes presidents Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Evo Morales of Bolivia, who have changed laws to boost their power and have also been accused of stifling media freedom.   What to watch:   — Worsening tensions between Correa and the media.   — Congress passing the controversial media reform bill.   Violent police protests rocked Correa’s government last year, reviving memories of Ecuador’s volatile history. He called them an attempted coup. [ID:nN30130945]   The government’s relations with the police remain tense and it has announced a plan to subject hundreds of policemen to lie detector tests to find out if they are involved in corruption or criminal activities.   Ecuador’s military calls the shots during crises and the police mutiny was no exception. Correa appears to have promised the military new equipment, but the soldiers’ assertiveness may also temper some of his policies, or undermine stability.   Three presidents were ousted in the decade before Correa took office in 2007. The military often played a critical role by refusing to assist the leaders being buffeted by protests.   What to watch:   — Government shelving plans to subject police to lie detectors.   — Police announcing internal changes to prevent the government from ordering a clean up.   After excluding itself from debt markets by defaulting on $3.2 billion in global bonds three years ago, Ecuador has met funding needs with bilateral credit deals, mostly from China.   Ecuador signed a $2 billion credit deal with China in late June and and is in final talks with a Chinese bank for a $571 million loan, which would take debt commitments to China to around $7.3 billion, including loans, advance payments for oil sales, and energy project financing. [ID:nN1E75Q1PC]   The government last month launched a bid to attract foreign investment for a plan to spend $8 billion in infrastructure, including roads, ports and airports. [ID:nS1E78J1TE]   Increased investments helped Ecuador’s economy grow 8.9 percent in the second quarter versus the same period last year, and it is on track to meet its 5.2 percent growth target for 2011. [ID:nS1E78S16R]   Ecuador may return to international debt markets with a bond issue in 2012, but past defaults, instability and Correa’s tempestuous relationship with the private sector mean it may have to pay very high yields. [ID:nN22115400]   The government expects $7 billion in mining investments in the next few years, and officials have been in talks for months with miners aiming to develop large projects.   Correa said in August that the negotiations with the mining firms were “really hard,” in part because the government was demanding an 8 percent royalty payment while foreign investors were offering to pay 6 percent. [ID:nN1E77223Y]   Oil companies including Schlumberger (SLB.N), Halliburton (HAL.N) and Baker & Hughes BHI.N are in talks over $1.5 billion in investments to increase output in four large mature oil fields controlled by state-run oil company Petroecuador.   Ecuador has offered $168 million to Brazilian oil company Petrobras for its assets in the country, which were nationalized after Petrobras refused to sign a new contract giving the state a larger share of its revenue. Petrobras is reportedly seeking $300 million for its Ecuador unit.   What to watch:   — Petrobras may seek international arbitration.   — Government could increase pressure on miners.   A judge ordered Chevron (CVX.N) in February to pay $8.6 billion to clean up pollution at old drilling sites in the Amazon. Chevron denies the charges, and the 17-year-old legal saga looks far from over as both sides appeal. [ID:nN25225194]   A U.S. judge later froze the enforcement of the ruling outside Ecuador, but in mid-September an appeals court reversed the order, although the plaintiffs promised not to seek enforcement until their appeal process in Ecuador is completed. [ID:nS1E78I21W]   Correa expelled the U.S. ambassador in April over U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks that suggested Correa was aware of the corrupt police practices. [ID:nN05119498]   Washington responded by expelling Ecuador’s envoy, but Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino said late last month that relations are on the mend and that both countries have appointed ambassadors, although the appointments still need to be ratified. [ID:nS1E78L00H]   Speculation is rife in Ecuador that the friction could prompt U.S. lawmakers not to renew a regional trade preferences deal that expired in February.   What to watch:   — Further legal rulings and moves in the Chevron case.   — U.S., Ecuador may ratify ambassadors in their posts.

33,SLB,UPDATE 1-Western oil groups eye Myanmar changes cautiously,"* Total says no early increase in investments * Technip says Western companies to return slowly * Schlumberger not predicting big jump in new orders By Tom Bergin LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - International energy groups are unlikely to rapidly expand their activities in autocratic Myanmar after recent signs of political change in the country, which holds valuable reserves of oil and gas. Christophe de Margerie, chief executive of France’s Total SA  , said his company, which has a project in the former British colony, would like to play a bigger role in the country, formerly known as Burma, but had to see concrete signs of increased democratisation before this was possible. Western trade sanctions have been in place since the military crushed a 1988 student uprising, isolating Myanmar’s army dictatorships, but in March the army nominally handed over power to civilians after elections in November. The process was ridiculed at the time as a sham to cement authoritarian rule behind a democratic facade. It was followed by other overtures such as calls for peace with ethnic minority guerrilla groups, some tolerance of criticism and more communication with Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who was released last year from 15 years of house arrest. On Tuesday, state television said 6,359 prisoners would be freed on Wednesday and political detainees are expected to be included. “We decided that ... it was important to be in Myanmar but that we will not invest until things are getting better ... I do hope that will happen,” Total’s de Margerie told reporters on the sidelines of the Oil and Money conference in London. Total leads the $1 billion Yadana gas project in the Andaman Sea, and the CEO said he would like to back additional exploration and production investments. U.S. oil major Chevron is a partner in Yadana but Washington banned new investments in Myanmar by U.S. companies in 1997 and barred imports. Ali Moshiri, President, Chevron Africa and Latin America Exploration and Production Company  declined to talk about possible new investments in Myanmar. Thierry Pilenko, chief executive officer of French oil services provider Technip SA , said he expected Western oil companies to respond to the changes by increasing investment, but cautiously. “The evolution is probably in favour of bringing more companies in ... I don’t think this is going to be a fast process,” he said at the sidelines of the conference. New investments by Western oil companies could be a boon for companies like Technip, which build and supply their facilities. But Andrew Gould, chief executive of the world’s largest oil services company, Schlumberger NV , said it was too soon to tell the implications from the recent political easing. Myanmar’s crude oil reserves are estimated at 3.2 billion barrels, the energy ministry has said. This compares with China’s proven oil reserves of 14.8 billion barrels, Malaysia’s 5.8 billion, Vietnam’s 4.4 billion and Indonesia’s 4.2 billion barrels, at the end of 2010, according to the BP Statistical Review. The country’s proven gas reserves tripled in the past decade to around 800 billion cubic metres, equivalent to more than a quarter of Australia’s, BP Statistical Review figures show.",10112011,http://www.reuters.com/article/oil-myanmar/update-1-western-oil-groups-eye-myanmar-changes-cautiously-idUSL5E7LB2J020111011

35,SLB,"Schlumberger Q3 profit falls short, shares slip","(Reuters) - Schlumberger (SLB.N), the world’s largest oilfield services company, posted a lower-than-expected third-quarter profit and acknowledged that financial turmoil would dampen near-term earnings, sending its shares down 1 percent. Oil prices are down from their second-quarter peak, raising concerns that energy companies may trim spending on new wells. But Schlumberger said growing demand for offshore drilling would help its business. The company is also getting a boost from activity in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Brazil. Paal Kibsgaard, Schlumberger’s new chief executive, described Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter profits, which average $1.19 per share, as “on the optimistic side.” Analysts said the company had tried to cool expectations for the third quarter too, but the hints went largely unheeded. A surge in offshore drilling, however, along with all the growth outside North America, underpinned a good 2012 outlook. “While the financial turmoil introduces some uncertainty over near-term activity, it has yet to have an impact on the actual activity of our customers,” Kibsgaard told analysts on a call, anticipating that any reductions would be “short-lived.” Third-quarter profits were hurt by significant delays in start-ups on Middle East land-based seismic surveys, which clients use as a visual guide to drilling, Schlumberger said. “Beyond that, its outlook for the service industry remains very positive,” said Bill Conroy, head of research at Houston-based Pritchard Capital. North American profits topped expectations, driven by drilling in shale fields. Kibsgaard said the main concerns in that area were around a potential slide in prices for pressure pumping as more equipment is built to serve the market. Overall, Schlumberger’s third-quarter net profit fell to $1.3 billion, or 96 cents a share, from $1.7 billion, or $1.38 a share, a year earlier, when it recorded a gain of nearly $1 per share on the increased value of M-I Swaco after buying Smith International, its partner in the joint venture. Excluding one-time items, Schlumberger earned 98 cents per share, below an average forecast of $1.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 49 percent to $10.23 billion. The quarter also included a handover of the CEO mantle to 44-year-old Kibsgaard from Andrew Gould, a respected industry figure who remains chairman but is due to retire this year. Asked about the global oil market, Gould did not see a risk of disruption from fresh oil supplies, and noted the demand impact of recent uncertainty was “not particularly powerful.” “I don’t see that supply could change the picture in the short term,” he said, adding that he might “come and say goodbye” on the January conference call. On Monday, rival Halliburton Co (HAL.N) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, but its less assured view of North American prospects led investors to hammer down its shares. Schlumberger shares were down 1 percent at $67.23 in afternoon trading, while higher oil prices lifted the Philadelphia oil service index .OSX by more than 1 percent. As of Thursday, Schlumberger’s shares were down 23 percent in the past six months, while Halliburton was down 31 percent, both tracking the sector in response to weaker oil prices.

36,SLB,"UPDATE 6-Schlumberger Q3 profit falls short, shares slip","* Q3 EPS ex-items 98 cts vs Wall St view of $1.01 * CEO says Q4 EPS estimate of $1.19 on “optimistic side” * Financial turmoil weighs on prospects, positive on 2012 * Shares slip despite sector rise * Rival Weatherford reports results next Tuesday By Matt Daily and Braden Reddall Oct 21 (Reuters) - Schlumberger , the world’s largest oilfield services company, posted a lower-than-expected third-quarter profit and acknowledged that financial turmoil would dampen near-term earnings, sending its shares down 1 percent. Oil prices are down from their second-quarter peak, raising concerns that energy companies may trim spending on new wells. But Schlumberger said growing demand for offshore drilling would help its business. The company is also getting a boost from activity in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Brazil. Paal Kibsgaard, Schlumberger’s new chief executive, described Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter profits, which average $1.19 per share, as “on the optimistic side.” Analysts said the company had tried to cool expectations for the third quarter too, but the hints went largely unheeded. A surge in offshore drilling, however, along with all the growth outside North America, underpinned a good 2012 outlook. “While the financial turmoil introduces some uncertainty over near-term activity, it has yet to have an impact on the actual activity of our customers,” Kibsgaard told analysts on a call, anticipating that any reductions would be “short-lived.” Third-quarter profits were hurt by significant delays in start-ups on Middle East land-based seismic surveys, which clients use as a visual guide to drilling, Schlumberger said. “Beyond that, its outlook for the service industry remains very positive,” said Bill Conroy, head of research at Houston-based Pritchard Capital. North American profits topped expectations, driven by drilling in shale fields. Kibsgaard said the main concerns in that area were around a potential slide in prices for pressure pumping as more equipment is built to serve the market. Overall, Schlumberger’s third-quarter net profit fell to $1.3 billion, or 96 cents a share, from $1.7 billion, or $1.38 a share, a year earlier, when it recorded a gain of nearly $1 per share on the increased value of M-I Swaco after buying Smith International, its partner in the joint venture. Excluding one-time items, Schlumberger earned 98 cents per share, below an average forecast of $1.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 49 percent to $10.23 billion. The quarter also included a handover of the CEO mantle to 44-year-old Kibsgaard from Andrew Gould, a respected industry figure who remains chairman but is due to retire this year. Asked about the global oil market, Gould did not see a risk of disruption from fresh oil supplies, and noted the demand impact of recent uncertainty was “not particularly powerful.” “I don’t see that supply could change the picture in the short term,” he said, adding that he might “come and say goodbye” on the January conference call. On Monday, rival Halliburton Co posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit, but its less assured view of North American prospects led investors to hammer down its shares. Schlumberger shares were down 1 percent at $67.23 in afternoon trading, while higher oil prices lifted the Philadelphia oil service index by more than 1 percent. As of Thursday, Schlumberger’s shares were down 23 percent in the past six months, while Halliburton was down 31 percent, both tracking the sector in response to weaker oil prices.

37,SLB,UPDATE 2-Schlumberger sheds 14 more rigs with Saxon deal,"* Schlumberger gets out of non-core rig ownership business * Saxon wants to be its go-to driller, enters Middle East By Braden Reddall Dec 5 (Reuters) - Schlumberger is selling its rig management business to a Canadian company that it part owns, as the world’s largest oilfield services company sharpens its focus on providing services for rigs instead of owning them. Saxon, bought by Schlumberger and private equity firm First Reserve in 2008, said on Monday it would take over 14 land drilling rigs and their crews in Oman, Pakistan and Venezuela, adding 1,100 people as it expands into the Middle East. The deal should strengthen the ties of the two companies in well construction and other rig services, while getting Schlumberger out of a non-core business, Saxon Chief Executive Mick McNulty told Reuters in a phone interview. “We’d like to be seen as their preferred driller,” McNulty said of his company’s 49 percent shareholder. Saxon and Schlumberger were already partners in Mexico and Colombia before the $560 million takeover in 2008. Saxon also has drilling and workover rigs in Canada, the United States, Venezuela, Peru and Ecuador. Saxon will own 95 drilling and workover rigs and employ 2,700 people as a result of the latest deal, for which no financial terms were disclosed. McNulty said the Calgary-based company is building a back-office center in Dubai for its move into the Middle East region, which follows its recent expansion into Australia. “We like the idea of having more diversity of revenue,” McNulty said, adding that its main South American market still offered some growth opportunities. For its part, Schlumberger is taking another step away from rig ownership, following an asset swap in May that handed Russia’s Eurasia Drilling Co 19 drilling rigs, 34 workover rigs and 23 sidetracking rigs in Western Siberia in exchange for Eurasia’s drilling services assets. Schlumberger had already shed its offshore drilling rigs over the past decade, first selling the 44 rigs of Sedco Forex to Transocean Ltd in 1999 for $3.2 billion, followed by a couple more sold to Noble Corp four years later.",12052011,http://www.reuters.com/article/schlumberger-saxon/update-2-schlumberger-sheds-14-more-rigs-with-saxon-deal-idUSN1E7B419P20111205
38,SLB,UPDATE 1-Petrofac teams up with Schlumberger for big projects,"* Says tie-up will enable it to work on larger scale projects LONDON, JAN 5 - British energy services firm Petrofac  said it will team up with Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services company, to enable it to bid for bigger projects with national oil companies and other firms. The two companies said on Thursday that they had signed a co-operation agreement which will let them work together on projects to help resource holders such as national oil companies develop and enhance production from their oil and gas fields. “The creation of this framework will enable us to bid jointly for projects of a scale that we would not pursue independently, and to develop them at a much faster pace,” Andy Inglis, head of Petrofac’s Integrated Energy Services (IES) division said. Petrofac said last year that it aimed to double its 2010 earnings by 2015 through building up its IES business which provides services to help develop oil reserves. The two companies said they believe a significant opportunity exists to win business from major resource holders which want to develop low-risk reserves. Such holders tend to be national oil companies who lack the expertise to boost production themselves but don’t want to give up the title to reserves, which they would have to do if they teamed up with a traditional oil firm. Petrofac became the first foreign company to operate fields in Mexico for 70 years when it won a contract there in August, and has also set its sights on winning business in Iraq and Turkmenistan. Shares in Petrofac closed at 1,465 pence on Wednesday, valuing the firm at 5.1 billion pounds ($7.96 billion).",1052012,http://www.reuters.com/article/petrofac/update-1-petrofac-teams-up-with-schlumberger-for-big-projects-idUSL6E8C50CK20120105

44,SLB,Statoil awards compression contract to Schlumberger unit,"OSLO, April 12 (Reuters) - Norwegian energy company Statoil  has contracted Framo Engineering, a unit of Schlumberger, to design and build one of the world’s first subsea gas-compression plants for the Gullfaks field off Norway, Statoil said on Thursday. The contract is for nearly 900 million crowns ($155 million), the company said. “This may increase the production from the field by three billion cubic metres of gas, enabling Gullfaks to sustain plateau production for gas export,” Jannicke Nilsson, Statoil’s western North Sea chief, said in a statement. Statoil and partner Petoro, which represents the Norwegian state, settled last year on a subsea solution for gas compression to boost reservoir pressure some 15 kilometres from the Gullfaks C platform. The company said current recovery rate of petroleum production in the area is 62 percent. Subsea compression could help boost that to 74 percent. Production at Gullfaks, which started in 1986, peaked in 1994 at more than 30 million cubic metres of oil equivalent and fell below 5 billion cubic metres in 2010, according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. Statoil is the operator with a 70 percent interest, with Petoro claiming the rest.",4122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/statoil/statoil-awards-compression-contract-to-schlumberger-unit-idUSL6E8FC2NH20120412
45,SLB,"Schlumberger lifted by deepwater rebound, shares rise","(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world’s largest oilfield services company, posted a quarterly profit that narrowly topped forecasts as business outside North America and in deepwater regions improved. The company, whose shares rose more than 4 percent, said it expects more than 10 percent growth this year in the number of rigs working outside of North America, which has been the big profit driver in recent years. Analysts said Schlumberger sounded notably more positive on pricing improvements in international markets. “The key to the (Schlumberger) story is the acceleration of international and deepwater activity, which should escalate in 2013 and beyond,” UBS analyst Angie Sedita said in a note to clients. Weakness in North American hydraulic fracturing services has been clearly signaled by Schlumberger and others due to pricing pressure in natural gas basins, where activity is slowing. That pressure has now reached liquids-producing areas in the region as well. “Still, our well-balanced service portfolio on land and our strong leverage towards the Gulf of Mexico put us in a good position to outperform in the North America market,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said. Oil companies have moved to tap into reservoirs in ever-deeper waters around the globe in recent years, triggering a boom for the service companies and drillers, which can earn billions from the expensive projects. Schlumberger said on Friday first-quarter net profit rose 39 percent to $1.3 billion, or 97 cents per share, from $944 million, or 69 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a one-time charge, its earnings of 98 cents a share came in slightly above the 97 cents estimated on average by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $10.6 billion from $8.7 billion a year ago. Schlumberger extended contracts to work off Brazil, an area that energy companies believe could hold vast amounts oil, and said it was now profitable again in Libya. Kibsgaard said activity there would return to pre-conflict levels early next year. Second-ranked Halliburton Co (HAL.N) earlier this week defied some of the worst predictions by reporting a higher-than-expected profit, and said it expected the downward pressure on frack pricing to ease later in 2012. Fracking has been an industry bright spot in recent years as energy companies tapped new U.S. discoveries. But the new sources also created a natural gas glut that has driven down prices for the fuel by more than 60 percent over the past 10 months, “with little likelihood of short-term recovery,” Schlumberger said. Kibsgaard said that liquids production required less pressure pumping horsepower than natural gas, which meant there would be some extra capacity even if the overall North American rig count remained the same. The outlook for capital expenditures of $4.5 billion this year is unchanged, but Kibsgaard said Schlumberger was already cutting back on pump additions in North America. The degree to which spending would shift elsewhere later this year would depend on how much international demand picks up, he said. “I don’t think a shift from North America to international is going to be a significant problem because the activity level in North America is not really going down. The main issue you have is there is an oversupply of pumps,” he said. Schlumberger shares, which had fallen 19 percent in the past year, climbed 4.6 percent to $73.02 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Oil companies have moved to tap into reservoirs in ever-deeper waters around the globe in recent years, triggering a boom for the service companies and drillers that can earn billions from the expensive projects. That deepwater business helped offset some weakness in pricing for hydraulic fracturing services, or “fracking.” Sc hlumberger wa rned that pricing pressure in U.S. natural gas basins, where activity is slowing down, had moved to liquids-producing areas as well.

52,SLB,"National Oilwell Varco profits, backlog climb","(Reuters) - National Oilwell Varco Inc (NOV.N), the largest U.S. oilfield equipment maker, posted a higher-than-expected profit and modest growth in its order backlog, but its rig technology business fell short of analyst estimates and its shares retreated slightly. The highly acquisitive company struck a deal this month to buy Schlumberger’s (SLB.N) Wilson distribution arm, and Schlumberger disclosed on Wednesday that the sale of the unit, which made $2.1 billion in revenue in 2011, was for $800 million in cash. NOV’s biggest business, supplying technology to rigs, fell short of analysts’ estimates in the first quarter. Pritchard Capital analyst Bill Conroy said the profit beat was driven mainly by lower costs, but that rig technology revenue was $50 million short of his $2.31 billion estimate, while orders fell $300 million short at $1.9 billion. But NOV is confident that demand from its energy-producing customers will remain strong through 2012, and analysts see it as a good way to invest in the offshore drillers’ anticipated continued investment in their fleets. The Houston-based company is cautiously optimistic that North American onshore liquids drilling will offset the decline in natural gas activity, while the lucrative deepwater drilling market was “blossoming.” Chief Executive Pete Miller said he did not anticipate any major slowdown in the current pace of new offshore rig building as long as oil prices remained well above $75 per barrel. “It is probably in good shape right now, but if you went below that, you would have to ask some questions,” Miller told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday. First-quarter net profit climbed to $606 million, or $1.42 per share, from $407 million, or 96 cents per share, a year before. Excluding one-time transaction costs, the company said its earnings were $1.44 per share, topping the $1.39 per share that analysts had on average forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue increased 37 percent to $4.3 billion. Its backlog of mostly offshore rig equipment rose 2 percent from the fourth quarter to $10.36 billion.

53,SLB,"UPDATE 3-National Oilwell Varco profits, backlog climb","* Q1 EPS ex-items $1.44 vs $1.39 avg analyst view * Company says demand to remain strong through 2012 * Paid $800 mln for Schlumberger distribution unit * Rig technology business falls short of estimates * Shares down 1.7 pct By Braden Reddall April 25 (Reuters) - National Oilwell Varco Inc, the largest U.S. oilfield equipment maker, posted a higher-than-expected profit and modest growth in its order backlog, but its rig technology business fell short of analyst estimates and its shares retreated slightly. The highly acquisitive company struck a deal this month to buy Schlumberger’s Wilson distribution arm, and Schlumberger disclosed on Wednesday that the sale of the unit, which made $2.1 billion in revenue in 2011, was for $800 million in cash. NOV’s biggest business, supplying technology to rigs, fell short of analysts’ estimates in the first quarter. Pritchard Capital analyst Bill Conroy said the profit beat was driven mainly by lower costs, but that rig technology revenue was $50 million short of his $2.31 billion estimate, while orders fell $300 million short at $1.9 billion. But NOV is confident that demand from its energy-producing customers will remain strong through 2012, and analysts see it as a good way to invest in the offshore drillers’ anticipated continued investment in their fleets. The Houston-based company is cautiously optimistic that North American onshore liquids drilling will offset the decline in natural gas activity, while the lucrative deepwater drilling market was “blossoming.” Chief Executive Pete Miller said he did not anticipate any major slowdown in the current pace of new offshore rig building as long as oil prices remained well above $75 per barrel. “It is probably in good shape right now, but if you went below that, you would have to ask some questions,” Miller told analysts on a conference call on Wednesday. First-quarter net profit climbed to $606 million, or $1.42 per share, from $407 million, or 96 cents per share, a year before. Excluding one-time transaction costs, the company said its earnings were $1.44 per share, topping the $1.39 per share that analysts had on average forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue increased 37 percent to $4.3 billion. Its backlog of mostly offshore rig equipment rose 2 percent from the fourth quarter to $10.36 billion. National Oilwell Varco’s shares were down 1.7 percent to $76.68 in Wednesday afternoon trading. They have rallied nearly 15 percent so far this year, double the gain in the Philadelphia Oil Service companies index.",4252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/nationaloilwellvarco/update-3-national-oilwell-varco-profits-backlog-climb-idUSL2E8FP1CO20120425

The executive, Miguel Galuccio, is an engineer who led the integrated project management unit of Schlumberger (SLB.N). Fernandez made the announcement on Friday after signing into law a bill to seize control of YPF from Spain’s Repsol (REP.MC). “The idea is to have a YPF that is absolutely modern, competitive, with professional people but with a political orientation aimed at achieving energy self-sufficiency once again to sustain growth, employment and economic activity,” Fernandez said in a live televised speech. YPF (YPFD.BA) was renationalized as part of Fernandez’s bid to tighten state control over the economy. It had been privatized in the 1990s after 70 years of full state control, and her government accused Repsol of allowing production to fall as it squeezed profits from YPF - a charge Repsol denies. Argentina’s lower house of Congress overwhelmingly passed on Thursday the bill to expropriate Repsol’s 51 percent stake in YPF, reflecting broad popular support for the measure despite protests from Spain and the European Union. Many Argentines are wary of foreign companies and blame the free-market policies of the 1990s for causing the country’s 2001-2002 sovereign debt default and shock currency devaluation. But foreign analysts warn that this could scare off the investment needed to build domestic industry, stoke growth and cool off Argentina’s double-digit inflation. The appointment of Galuccio could soothe some market concerns, however. The 44-year-old Argentine worked for YPF before Repsol took control in the late 1990s and he has more than 20 years of experience in the field. At Schlumberger, he initially worked in Mexico and Central America, increasing ties between his company and Mexican state oil company Pemex, according to a press statement.

59,SLB,Schlumberger forms robotic ocean-monitor venture,"(Reuters) - Liquid Robotics, a maker of automated technology for measuring ocean data, has formed a venture with Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) to deploy more of the startup’s seafaring robots for the oil and gas industry. The Wave Gliders, as they are known, operate in remote parts of the ocean and can measure things such as fish populations and oil spills. A few were even sent to the Japanese coast last year to measure radiation after the nuclear disaster there. The formation of the Houston-based joint venture comes only a year after Liquid Robotics received a $20 million investment from VantagePoint Capital Partners along with $2 million in funding from Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services company. Ashok Belani, Schlumberger’s chief technology officer, saw Wave Gliders as especially useful in offshore exploration for seismic, subsea and environmental monitoring. Schlumberger, for example, has a large division that produces seismic mapping of underwater reservoirs for its clients drilling offshore. Liquid Robotics already earns about a third of its revenue from oil and gas companies, the company said last year. The Sunnyvale, California-based company is run by Bill Vass, a former president of Sun Microsystems, now owned by Oracle Corp ORCL.O. Since Wave Gliders run for up to a year without a crew, fuel or dedicated support vessels, Vass says the savings for companies that use them can be large. Tracking oil levels in water from a boat can cost $30,000-$70,000 a day, he said, but subscribing to Wave Glider data might cost around $500,000 for the full year. The technology converts the up-and-down motion of waves to forward motion, so they can propel themselves without big batteries.

63,SLB,"UPDATE 1-Anton, Schlumberger to focus on China shale gas sector","* Anton eyes Schlumberger’s shale gas technology * Shale gas development at early stage in China * Anton benefiting from China’s rapidly growing gas industry HONG KONG, July 12 (Reuters) - Anton Oilfield Services Group  plans to strengthen ties with Schlumberger Ltd  in shale gas development in China after the North American oilfield services company took a stake in it, the Hong Kong-listed Chinese company said on Thursday. Shale gas development is still at an early stage in China, the world’s largest energy user, where technically recoverable reserves of the unconventional fuel are estimated to be even higher than in the United States. China, which wants to draw more private investment into its energy sector to help shore up economic growth, is expected to hold its second shale gas auction this month, with private investors allowed to bid for the first time. “Through the stock purchase, Schlumberger hopes to strengthen its ties with Anton Oilfield in China,” Anton chairman Luo Lin told reporters at a conference call to brief on the company’s business strategy. “We are in talks to expand our cooperation. I believe unconventional gas is an area with bright prospect for cooperation. Shale gas will be a focus of our cooperation.” Schlumberger can help improve Anton’s shale gas drilling technology known as hydraulic fracturing, while it can also use Anton’s staff manpower to help it expand in China, he said. Schlumberger this week acquired about 20.1 percent of the privately-controlled Chinese oilfield service provider for an estimated $80 million, amid a rapid increase in China’s natural gas demand. Anton Oilfield, which was founded in 1999 and now has about 1,000 employees, has said it first entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with Schlumberger in 2010 in drilling fluids and well-cementing services. The Chinese company has also been working with Schlumberger in gas storage service and gas exploration in the Tarim basin in northwest China, Luo said. Anton Oilfield has said Schlumberger would not be involved in the management of Anton and its cooperation with other business partners would remain unchanged. Shares of Anton ended down 3.82 percent at HK$1.51 on Thursday, underperforming a fall of 2 percent in the benchmark Hang Seng.

A surprising bounceback in U.S. operations for Baker Hughes sparked a nearly 9 percent leap in its shares to above $45. But the shares remain $3 short of where they were before the company’s March profit warning about its customers’ exodus out of U.S. natural gas fields. The Baker Hughes-compiled U.S. rig count has remained steady as natural gas reductions have been offset by more oil drilling. But the count outside North America hit 1,285 in June, its highest level since 1985, lifted by the inclusion of some 80 rigs in Iraq that expanded the Middle East count by a quarter. Baker Hughes stuck with its forecast for 8 percent growth in the international count this year, excluding the Iraqi rigs, while Schlumberger expects more than 10 percent growth. But Morningstar analyst Stephen Ellis said he was concerned that macroeconomic headwinds from Europe and China may weigh down oil prices and lead to more challenging results overseas. Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard, while generally upbeat on the quarterly conference call, also pointed to potential obstacles for international growth. “We saw significant volatility in the second quarter in terms of the global markets,” Kibsgaard said. “That volatility could bring some more caution into some of the operators, how they plan to go forward with activity.” Investment cycles outside the volatile U.S. and Canadian oilfields are generally smoother, and analysts said Schlumberger got a particularly big lift from Europe and Africa last quarter. Kibsgaard said North Africa and Russia remain promising, and he could not point to any disappointing regions. Assuming no macroeconomic issues, he expects pricing to continue improving this year. Both companies hailed the return of Gulf of Mexico drilling to levels seen before the disastrous oil spill there two years ago, and Baker Hughes CEO Martin Craighead expects five more deepwater rigs to join the 24 already there later this year. Schlumberger’s second-quarter net profit rose to $1.40 billion, or $1.05 per share, from $1.34 billion, or 98 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts’ average forecast was $1.00 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. [ID:nL2E8IK0IU] Revenue increased 16 percent to $10.45 billion, of which two-thirds was earned outside North America. Profit growth for Houston-based Baker Hughes was also driven by Europe, as well as better-than-expected earnings in its home market. Overall, it earned $439 million, or $1 per share, while analysts had expected 77 cents a share. Brokerage Tudor Pickering Holt described the results as “very good, especially against low expectations.” Like other U.S. hydraulic fracturing players, Baker was hit by a leap in the price of guar, a key ingredient in fracking fluid, as well as the shift to U.S. oil basins in response to decade-low natural gas prices. U.S. fracking leader Halliburton Co (HAL.N), which reports earnings on Monday, warned in June that North American profit margins were hit hard by the guar shortage. Craighead said guar prices, after peaking at $12 per pound in the second quarter, had come down to about $5 per pound in the last few weeks. But Baker Hughes said that would not help much this quarter as it must still use up pricier inventory. Kibsgaard said it was clear that fracking profit margins would continue to decline in the third quarter, which he hoped would be offset by greater activity in the Gulf of Mexico. “We are obviously well positioned to offset the hydraulic fracturing, but to what extent we can do it is still a bit uncertain,” he said.

68,SLB,"WRAPUP 1-Global oilfield growth lifts Schlumberger, Baker Hughes","* Both companies post higher-than-expected earnings * Revenue strong outside North America July 20 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd and Baker Hughes Inc, the world’s No. 1 and No. 3 oilfield services companies, posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday as revenue piled up outside North America. Investment cycles outside the volatile U.S. and Canadian oilfield markets are generally smoother, and analysts said Schlumberger got a particularly big lift from Europe and Africa. The closely watched Baker Hughes-compiled U.S. rig count has been steady as natural gas reductions have been offset by more oil drilling. But the count outside North America hit 1,285 in June, its highest level since 1985, lifted by the inclusion of some 80 rigs in Iraq that expanded the Middle East count by a quarter. Schlumberger’s second-quarter net profit rose to $1.40 billion, or $1.05 per share, from $1.34 billion, or 98 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts’ average forecast was $1.00 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue increased 16 percent to $10.45 billion, above the $10.41 billion analysts expected. Two-thirds of the revenue for Schlumberger, with its major offices in Paris, Houston and The Hague, was earned in markets outside North America. Profit growth for Houston-based Baker Hughes was also driven by Europe, and better-than-expected earnings in its home market. The company earned $439 million, or $1 per share. Analysts expected 77 cents a share. Analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt described the results as “very good, especially against low expectations.” Like other U.S. hydraulic fracturing players, Baker was hit by a leap in the price of guar, a key ingredient in fracking fluid, as well as the massive shift to U.S. oil basins in response to decade-low natural gas prices. Halliburton Co, the U.S. fracking leader, which reports earnings on Monday, warned in June that its North American profit margins were hit particularly hard by the guar shortage. Analysts say guar prices have already come off their peak and should continue sliding for the rest of the year. Shares of Schlumberger rose 2.5 percent to $70.34 in premarket trading on Friday. Halliburton rose 1 percent. Baker Hughes expects continuing improvement in the Gulf of Mexico and international markets, and CEO Martin Craighead was “cautiously optimistic” about the outlook for the rest of 2012. “If commodity prices remain at current levels, we believe activity in onshore U.S. should remain stable,” he said.",7202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/oilservices-earnings/wrapup-1-global-oilfield-growth-lifts-schlumberger-baker-hughes-idUSL2E8IK11Z20120720

72,SLB,UPDATE 3-Halliburton Q2 tops Wall St; sees better NAmerica in '13,"By Matt Daily and Braden Reddall July 23 (Reuters) - Halliburton Co posted a quarterly profit on Monday that topped Wall Street forecasts, helped by increased activity outside North America, where it expected margins would start recovering by early next year. Shares of Halliburton, the world’s second-largest oilfield services company behind Schlumberger, rose 2.5 percent despite a decline in oil prices weighing down the sector. Halliburton had warned last month that a shortage of guar beans in India would depress margins at its pressure pumping operations in shale fields, a key profit driver for the company. Guar, which is also used to make sauces and ice cream, is a key part of the hydraulic fracturing fluids that have been in high demand due to a boom in U.S. drilling and well development. Chief Executive David Lesar said on a conference call that the company’s decision to stockpile guar over the quarter meant it would be absorbing the higher guar costs for the rest of the year, even though prices were now declining. He referred to the elevated guar costs as like moving a “pig through the python.” “With 20/20 hindsight, simply put, we made the wrong decision. The result is we bought too much guar too early and paid too much for it,” Lesar said. “I want to be clear with you — I supported and agreed with the decision to secure the strategic guar reserve, and I will take the heat for it.” Halliburton has said previously that the guar system can account for as much as 30 percent of the overall fracking price. The shortage hurt earnings at its industry-leading fracking business and pulled profits slightly below the year-ago level. That compared with the results from Schlumberger and Baker Hughes Inc, which both posted higher profits on Friday, also lifted by strength outside North America. Still, Halliburton’s North American results were not as weak as many company watchers had feared. “North American margin degradation was less than expected,” Barclays analyst James West said in a note to investors. At its current share price “we believe Halliburton represents compelling value.” Halliburton has benefited from its leading position in North America in recent years as oil and gas producers poured money into developing shale fields, although its rising costs and a steep drop in natural gas prices have crimped profits this year. Net profit slipped to $737 million, or 79 cents per share, from $739 million, or 80 cents per share, a year before. Profit from continuing operations was 80 cents per share, beating the 75 cents that analysts on average had forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 22 percent to $7.2 billion, well above the $6.96 billion analysts had predicted. A drop of the nearly 5 percentage points in North American margins was partially offset by increased profitability in other markets, particularly Europe, Africa and Russia and other former Soviet states. Guar accounted for about two-thirds of the margin depression in North America, Halliburton said. Halliburton earned more than three-quarters of its 2011 income in North America, compared with about 40 percent for Schlumberger. “North America is still going to be a good market for Halliburton and international will be where the growth comes from,” said Scott Gruber, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein in New York, though he added that he preferred Schlumberger shares. Overall, Halliburton’s plans are unchanged. It is targeting $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion in capital expenditure this year — tightening the range from $3.5 billion to $4 billion previously. Halliburton’s shares, down 11 percent in 2012 through Friday, gained 2.5 percent to $31.58 in morning trading.

77,SLB,Schlumberger's clever frack takes aim at gas costs,"STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - Production costs of natural gas from unconventional fields could tumble in the United States if a new technique developed by Schlumberger lives up to its billing. The world’s largest oilfield services company by market value and others working in the industry have suffered this year because the runaway success of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and horizontal drilling techniques to extract so-called unconventional gas has created a glut and caused a price slide. But using a proprietary system called Hiway that only became commercially viable last year, Schlumberger’s fracker in chief believes he has knocked a lump out of the infant industry’s three major cost components; water, sand, and trucks. Schlumberger is already using the system on nearly a third of all fracking jobs, and expects that to rise rapidly to 50-70 percent, according to Kyel Hodenfield, the company’s vice president for unconventional resources. “It can vary, but using Hiway we generally say you need 40 percent less proppant,” (graded sand mixed with guar gum or lubricating chemicals), he told Reuters in an interview. “Water is more variable, but it’s somewhere between 20 and 50 percent less.” Less sand, less water and less pumping adds up to fewer trucks, Hodenfield explained on the sidelines of the Offshore Northern Seas (ONS) conference in Stavanger, Norway. “Those are the big costs. Anything you can do to reduce the amount of sand, the amount of water, and the amount of horsepower is going to fall to the bottom line.” Fracking, often combined with modern horizontal drilling techniques, recovers previously unreachable gas by fracturing the rock that contains it and then pumping in fluid and mined or manufactured sand to hold open the cracks and force out the gas. The process, pioneered in the United States, requires many more wells to be drilled than traditional oil and gas extraction. The fracking generally takes just a few days, even though some fracked fields will produce for years, so the infrastructure, materials and equipment need to be mobile. At some sites, water is piped in, but usually, both sand and water are trucked to the site. More trucks are needed to provide the horsepower to pump the mixture into the cracks, and road regulations restrict their size, so the number of heavy vehicles per site can be considerable. Schlumberger is the number-two in fracking services, as measured by the horsepower of its fleet, with a 12 percent share of the market in 2011, according to analysts at Global Hunter Securities. It lies behind Halliburton and ahead of Baker Hughes in the ranking, although its exposure to the industry is relatively small in the context of its traditional oil and gas services business worldwide. Hodenfield would not reveal how much of Schlumberger’s business is now in U.S. unconventionals, “but I can say it’s grown, a lot”, he said. So how does Hiway work? Hodenfield, who grew up in North Dakota where the Bakken field is at the centre of the U.S. shale gas boom, brightens at the opportunity to explain a process that adds a proprietary fiber to the traditional sand and fluid mix, and uses a “pulsing” system to send globs of the fiber in between each injection. The dissolvable fiber globs create more effective channels for the gas to flow, and the pulsing rhythm can be made to match the geological structure of the rock, also pushing the sand deeper into the cracks and resulting in more effective openings that conduct gas better for every liter pumped in. Hiway is not the only new technique on the scene as oil companies look to use fracking to reach more lucrative oil as well as gas. Schlumberger and other innovators are also using sophisticated seismic techniques, combined with data from pilot wells, to reduce the number of fracks along a drill pipe and target only the “sweet spots” in the field. Together, these new techniques and smart rugged sensor kit from National Instruments can also reduce the production pace variability that plagues the unconventional industry. And according to one senior executive at one of the world’s major oil companies, these cost-saving innovations may only be the beginning. “It’s mostly brute force up to now,” he said. “When the oil majors get serious about investment in fracking the cost could fall by half.” U.S. fracking expenditure is not pocket change. Hodenfield cites data from analysts Spears & Associates saying the total onshore oil and gas industry drilling and completions spend, boosted mainly by unconventional work, has soared to $150 billion a year from $20 billion in 2002. This eclipses the offshore spend, which was at a similar $20 billion level 10 years ago and has only recently recovered to that level after the Macondo oil spill disaster of 2010. Hodenfield says smarter technology is also the key to reducing the environmental impact of fracking in shale rock, tight gas, coal bed methane and other unconventional gas fields. “We have a choice,” he said. “We can take the brute force approach and drill a lot of wells and frack a lot of wells and live with the production variation and compensate that by drilling even more wells (with the consequent environmental footprint), or you drill only the best wells by defining the sweet spot and optimize the completion by technology.” ",8312012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-conference-schlumberger/schlumbergers-clever-frack-takes-aim-at-gas-costs-idUSBRE87U0GE20120831
78,SLB,Gas slump hits Baker; Schlumberger flexes global muscle,"(Reuters) - Steady growth in drilling activity outside North America gave a big lift to Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world’s largest oil services company, but the U.S. natural gas slump weighed even more than expected on rival Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N. Baker, the industry’s third-largest player worldwide, posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, sending its shares down nearly 6 percent. Schlumberger’s earnings per share beat analysts’ estimates by a couple of cents, but its stock fell more than 1 percent amid an oilfield services selloff. Profit margins at Baker suffered from a slump in North American pressure pumping, used in hydraulic fracturing. Both it and Schlumberger had less work and weaker pricing power in that market as depressed natural gas prices pushed the number of U.S. rigs targeting the fuel to a 13-year low. On top of that, Baker said Canadian activity was nearly 30 percent lower than a year earlier, while the total rig count in markets such as Brazil, Colombia and Norway fell 17 percent in third quarter from the second. But both Schlumberger and Baker said they expected activity in international markets to rebound in the current quarter, despite recent signs from industry data that global oilfield activity could be slowing because of uncertainty about the world economy. The latest count of active rigs outside North America, as measured by Baker, is up just 6 percent this year at 1,254, and the company now expects the full-year average to be only 3 percent higher than in 2011. Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said a steady upward trend in international pricing had continued in the third quarter, and he maintained a forecast for 10 percent growth in international activity for this year. “We maintain a positive outlook on the international market and we see growth in 2013 as well,” Kibsgaard told analysts on a call, targeting a double-digit increase in earnings next year. Nearest rival Halliburton Co (HAL.N), the U.S. market leader and the top fracking company, had already reported a weaker-than-expected third-quarter profit on Wednesday. Schlumberger, which is based in Curacao and has major offices in Paris, The Hague and Houston, said its net income had risen 9 percent to $1.42 billion, or $1.07 per share, from $1.30 billion, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings came to $1.08 per share, while analysts on average expected $1.06, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue increased 11 percent to $10.61 billion, compared with the analysts’ average estimate of $10.68 billion. “The company showed clear differentiation versus their peer group, especially with respect to North American results,” Barclays analyst James West said in a note to clients. Houston-based Baker Hughes, like other North American oil services companies, had the added burden of a short-lived spike in prices this year for guar, a key fracking fluid ingredient. The company’s third-quarter net income fell 60 percent to $279 million, or 63 cents per share, from $706 million, or $1.61 per share, a year earlier. Excluding charges for internally developed software and other information technology assets and for closing a chemical facility, Baker’s earnings of 73 cents per share missed the analysts’ average estimate of 84 cents. Revenue rose 3 percent to $5.23 billion, while analysts had expected $5.44 billion. UBS analyst Angie Sedita said Baker’s international margin of 12.1 percent had fallen short of her estimate. The company, which touted an improvement to 15 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, said on Friday it expected this quarter’s international margin to be flat with or down slightly from that level. Shares of Baker fell 5.6 percent to $44.47 in morning trading, and Schlumberger was down 1.1 percent at $74.00. At Thursday’s close, Baker was down 3 percent so far this year.

TNK-BP said it secured the deal with Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services company, to jointly implement a pilot project to develop hard-to-recover hydrocarbon reserves in the Severo-Khokhryakovskoe field in the West Siberia. “Under the terms of the contract, Schlumberger will coordinate all operations and provide the entire range of oilfield services within the framework of the project, apart from directional drilling,” TNK-BP said in a statement.",10252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/tnk-bp-schlumberger/tnk-bp-says-signs-tight-oil-deal-with-schlumberger-idUSL5E8LP4NL20121025

86,SLB,"Schlumberger, Cameron International form subsea JV","(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world’s largest oilfield services company, and oilfield equipment maker Cameron International Corp CAM.N said they would combine their subsea businesses as they look to tap into rising demand for drilling in deeper waters. Oil companies, bolstered by high oil prices, have raised exploration spending, venturing into areas like the Arctic or heading to very deep sea levels in regions like West Africa, requiring new techniques to access oil. About 200 such fields are expected to come online in the next four years and by 2020 more than 11,000 subsea wells will be in operation worldwide, Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard had said at a recent energy conference. In subsea operations, production equipment is based in the sea floor and is built to withstand strong ocean currents and harsh temperatures. “The JV’s mission is to unlock greater reservoir potential from customers’ subsea developments,” Cameron Chief Executive Jack Moore said in a conference call on Thursday. Cameron, which will manage the joint venture and hold a 60 percent stake, will receive $600 million from Schlumberger, it said in a statement. Schlumberger will contribute its Framo, Surveillance, Flow Assurance and Power and Controls businesses to the venture and own the remaining stake. “The partnership brings together Schlumberger’s expertise in subsea processing and platform integration with Cameron’s vast capabilities in subsea tree manufacturing,” Barclays analyst James West said. Credit Suisse advised Cameron while Goldman, Sachs & Co advised Schlumberger on the venture. Cameron shares rose as much as 4 percent to $53.15, while Schlumberger was up more than 1 percent at $68.80.

88,SLB,Schlumberger says drilling slowdown to hit profit,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world’s top oilfield services company, said on Friday its fourth-quarter earnings would be hurt by weaker-than-expected drilling activity in North America and contract delays in Europe and Africa. The forecast sent shares of the company down 5.8 percent. Oil and gas companies have slowed onshore exploration in North America as drilling budgets for the year are exhausted and prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids remain low. Schlumberger estimated the slowdown will hurt its earnings by 5 cents to 7 cents per share in the fourth quarter. Dahlman Rose & Co cut its earnings expectations for the company to $1.07 per share from $1.13 after the company’s profit warning. Analysts’ average estimate was $1.13, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Schlumberger’s profit warning may telegraph fourth-quarter weakness for oil and gas companies, analysts at Robert W. Baird said in a note to clients. At first glance, the warning “seems like a negative read on fourth-quarter exploration and production activity and management outlooks entering the new year,” they wrote. International drilling activity, which helped Schlumberger report better-than-expected third-quarter results, has begun to slow down due to uncertainty about the world economy. Europe, Russia and Africa were seeing higher-than-usual seasonal slowdown in activity, Schlumberger said. Those regions contributed 27 percent of the company’s oilfield service revenue of $31 billion in the first nine months of 2012. North America accounted for about a third. International capital expenditures on oil and gas exploration are expected to rise next year, but the “rate of growth in 2012 will be difficult to match due to the absence of surplus cash flow generation for (international oil companies) and ongoing introspection in Brazil,” analysts at Houston-based energy investment bank Simmons & Co wrote. Shares of Schlumberger were down $4.24 to $68.32 in late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

92,SLB,"Schlumberger fourth-quarter lifted by international, deepwater growth","(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) on Friday reported fourth-quarter earnings just above recently reduced expectations, lifted by strong growth in oil and gas services beyond the shores of North America. Schlumberger, the oilfield services sector leader, posted its fifth straight estimate-beating quarterly profit as growth in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia made up for a slowdown on North American land. International markets accounted for about two-thirds of its total 2012 revenue of $42.15 billion, which has helped the company build on its lead over Halliburton Co (HAL.N). Schlumberger shares rose more than 2 percent early on Friday, while Halliburton was up more than 1 percent. “In a challenging quarter for oil service companies, once again Schlumberger is clearly differentiating itself,” said analyst James Crandell of Dahlman Rose & Co. Oil and gas companies have slowed onshore exploration in North America as the going prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids, such as butane and propane, remain low. While Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard sees the negative impact of the glut still weighing on margins in the region, he expects the number of North American rigs to rise by between 100 and 150 in the first quarter. Kibsgaard said Saudi Arabia’s rig count would rise by about 25 rigs this year to 160, though global oil demand would grow at a similar pace to 2012 and spare capacity would be unchanged. DOUBLE-DIGIT EARNINGS AHEAD Kibsgaard forecast client spending in international markets would rise 10 percent, compared with no growth in North America, but Schlumberger earnings should grow by double digits in 2013. “This is assuming no major setback in the global economy and also no further significant setbacks in North America,” Kibsgaard told analysts on a conference call. Schlumberger cut its 2013 capital budget to $3.9 billion from $4.7 billion last year, and analysts at Simmons & Co expect spending directed at North American land to be “eviscerated.” Fourth-quarter net income fell to $1.37 billion, or $1.02 per share, from $1.41 billion, or $1.05 per share, a year before. Excluding items, earnings were $1.08 a share versus the analysts’ view of $1.07, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue increased 8 percent to $11.17 billion, comfortably beating the average estimate of $10.82 billion. Just over a month ago, Schlumberger warned the North American slowdown and contract delays in Europe and Africa would knock fourth-quarter earnings down by 5 cents to 7 cents per share. Latin America revenue rose 13 percent, while the Middle East and Asia jumped a combined 21 percent, compared with a 3 percent drop in North America. UBS analyst Angie Sedita noted strength in Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling more than offset onshore U.S. weakness. Offshore revenue was up 24 percent from the previous quarter.

96,SLB,Schlumberger to wind down Iran operations this year,"Jan 31 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd, the world’s largest oilfield services company, said on Thursday it would wind down operations in Iran this year after booking $208 million in net income there in 2012. While the company did not go into specifics, the decision comes as it faces a previously announced U.S. grand jury and regulatory probe of its activities in Iran, Syria, North Sudan and Cuba, which are all subject to government sanctions or restrictions. Schlumberger said it had not bid on any new Iranian oilfield work since March 2009, though some non-U.S. affiliates had been doing work for the National Iranian Oil Co or its affiliates. Revenue in 2012 from this work totaled $418 million. “Schlumberger intends to discontinue such activity in Iran in 2013 and is currently winding down its operations there,” the company said in its annual report, released on Thursday. Smith International, shortly before being taken over by Schlumberger, announced in 2010 it was actively pursuing the termination of all activities in Iran and Sudan because the U.S. government had imposed economic sanctions or other restrictions. In the fourth quarter, Schlumberger recorded revenue relating to the Iran activity of $92 million and net income of $48 million. The company’s overall fourth-quarter net income was $1.37 billion, on revenue of $11.17 billion.

97,SLB,UPDATE 2-Schlumberger says North America weaker than expected in Q1,"(Adds background on rig count, earnings; updates shares) By Braden Reddall March 18 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd, the world’s largest oilfield services company, warned on Monday that North American activity was weaker than expected in the first quarter as U.S. drillers returned to work at a slower pace than the company predicted. Shares of Schlumberger fell 2.6 percent to $77.34 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard on Monday said asset utilization recovered from a holiday slowdown and that the lower cost of a key hydraulic fracturing ingredient, guar, was providing some relief. But pricing remains the fundamental issue, he added. “We continue to see negative pricing pressure in many product lines in the first quarter, with active participation from our principal competitors, reinforcing the somewhat unclear outlook for the North America land market at this stage,” he said in a speech at the Howard Weil energy conference in New Orleans. Schlumberger, with an extensive international reach, is less exposed to North America than rivals Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc. The North American natural gas glut has forced many drillers to shut down rigs until gas prices recover. Kibsgaard raised a few eyebrows among analysts with a prediction in January that between 100 and 150 U.S. rigs could go back to work in the first quarter - a quicker recovery than many others had anticipated. As of the end of last week, the total number of U.S. rigs working had increased by 13 so far in the first quarter to 1,776, according to a closely watched tally by Baker Hughes. Analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt said on Monday the rig count looked to be generally trending higher given “healthy crude oil prices” and the natural gas rig count bottoming out, and they saw oilfield services stocks as a good bet over this year even if they were “ripe for a short-term breather.” Looking offshore, Kibsgaard said on Monday that Gulf of Mexico activity had been temporarily affected by the replacement of subsea connector bolts on some rigs there. Last month, U.S. regulators told rig contractors to inspect the bolts, made by General Electric Co, after a leak. Schlumberger maintained its goal of double-digit earnings growth for 2013, assuming North America land activity and pricing levels come in line with expectations and that it reaches a solution in Venezuela, where it saw a significant slowdown in the rates of payments by customers last quarter. Analysts had been expecting earnings per share growth of 14 percent to $4.74 in 2013, according to the average on Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Among international markets, Kibsgaard highlighted Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Russia, China and Africa. The Saudi rig count would reach 170 by the end of this year, he said, raising the estimate by 10 rigs from his forecast in January. In Iraq, where the oilfield services industry has been investing for years in anticipation of growth, Kibsgaard expected 2013 revenue of $600 million and good profitability. As for all the unconventional resources unlocked by hydraulic fracturing, he said North America would remain the center of activity, especially in oil, and the short-term focus outside the region would be on pilot projects. “Activity and production will likely start to become more meaningful in the second half of this decade,” he said of global unconventionals.

102,SLB,Forest Oil taps Schlumberger to develop Eagle Ford acreage,"April 12 (Reuters) - Forest Oil Corp said Schlumberger Ltd, the oilfield services sector leader, will pick up a 50 percent working interest in the oil and gas producer’s Eagle Ford shale acreage by paying $90 million towards future drilling costs. Debt-heavy Forest oil has raised $600 million from asset disposals since last July to improve liquidity. The company had $1.86 billion in debt and $1.1 million in cash and equivalents as of Dec. 31, according to Thomson Reuters data. Forest, whose cash flows have decreased due to weak natural gas prices, has turned attention to liquids output in the Texas-Oklahoma Panhandle, East Texas and Eagle Ford Shale in Texas. Forest, which will operate the Eagle Ford drilling program, expects to spend the $90 million by the end of 2014, it said in a statement on Friday. Forest expects its share of capital expenditure in the  development plan to be about $125 million in 2013, and $220 million in 2014. Beyond that, Forest and Schlumberger will share future drilling costs equally. The company plans to increase drilling to four rigs by the end of the third quarter, from one to two rigs currently. Sales volumes in 2014 are expected to scale up to 6,500 boe/d (barrels of oil equivalent per day), from 1,600 boe/d in 2012. As part of the agreement, Schlumberger will provide drilling, completion and lifting technologies and reservoir management technologies, besides other services. Forest Oil shares, which have more than halved in the past year, were marginally down at $5.00 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.

105,SLB,WRAPUP 2-Baker sees U.S. drilling pickup; Schlumberger cautious,"* Baker forecasts modest increase in U.S. rig count for 2013 * Schlumberger remains cautious on North America * Both companies beat first-quarter profit estimates * Halliburton reports results on Monday By Braden Reddall April 19 (Reuters) - Signs of improvement in the depressed North American drilling market and steady growth elsewhere helped oilfield services companies Schlumberger Ltd and Baker Hughes Inc beat Wall Street’s profit expectations. Sector leader Schlumberger posted earnings above analysts’ estimates for the sixth straight quarter, lifted by strong and consistent growth in countries including Saudi Arabia, Iraq, China and Australia. Schlumberger shares were unchanged at $71 in morning trading. Cowen Securities analyst Jim Crandell said revenue in Europe and Latin America, in particular, fell short of his estimates. Third-ranked Baker Hughes’ profit also topped estimates, and the company forecast a modest increase in U.S. rig counts for 2013. As the United States starts to clear a natural gas glut created by the hydraulic fracturing revolution, prices for the fuel have improved, reducing the drag on drilling activity there. “North America took a step in the right direction,” Baker Hughes Chief Executive Officer Martin Craighead told analysts on a conference call on Friday. Baker Hughes shares were down 0.7 percent at $44.28. While overall earnings were down 30 percent from a year earlier, the company said increased drilling in Canada and a strong pumping business lifted its first-quarter profit in North America from the previous quarter. UBS analyst Angie Sedita said Baker had a solid quarter in the Middle East as well as North America, two areas of relative weakness in the past. “We expect further margin gains ahead (at a measured pace) across regions in 2013,” she wrote in a note to investors. Looking at signs that U.S. land drilling was improving, Barclays analysts said the number of permits issued in the country rose by 8 percent in March from February. Schlumberger, which said last month that North American activity was weaker than expected, said it was still uncertain about the region. Low natural gas prices had made drilling for gas uneconomical in many fields and weighed down the prices charged for services like pressure pumping, which is used in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Schlumberger, whose main offices are in Paris, Houston and The Hague, generated roughly two-thirds of its 2012 revenue outside North America, insulating itself from the always-volatile drilling region more than Halliburton or Baker Hughes did. Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard said the outlook for drilling activity in international markets and for liquids in North America remained “pretty solid” at current oil prices. Kibsgaard stuck with his forecast that client spending outside North America would rise 10 percent this year, lifting Schlumberger earnings by a double-digit percentage rate. Schlumberger’s first-quarter net income fell 3 percent to $1.26 billion, or 94 cents per share. Excluding items, it was $1.01 per share, while revenue rose to $10.67 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of 99 cents per share on revenue of $10.7 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Strong activity in Canada and solid results from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico only partially offset weakness in U.S. land drilling, the company said. While U.S. natural gas prices  rose 15 percent in the quarter, drilling has not yet bounced back, and gas producers have trimmed 2013 exploration budgets. As for Baker Hughes, its first-quarter net income fell to $267 million, or 60 cents per share, from $379 million, or 86 cents per share. Excluding a $23 million loss from Venezuelan currency devaluation, the company earned 65 cents per share, above Wall Street expectations of 62 cents. Revenue fell 2 percent to $5.23 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $5.18 billion.

The company, which reported a 7.6 percent rise in first-quarter revenue on Friday, said it continued to see strong and consistent growth in regions such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, China and Australia but the outlook for North America was uncertain. Schlumberger said there had been no improvement in dry gas drilling in North America, despite significant drawdowns on inventories. Weak natural gas prices have made drilling for the fuel uneconomic, bringing down the prices oilfield service companies charge for services such as pressure pumping. Schlumberger, which generated roughly two-thirds of its 2012 revenue from its international operations, is better insulated from the drilling slowdown in North America than rivals Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc. Baker Hughes, the world’s third-largest oilfield services provider, reported a 30 percent fall in profit on Friday, citing weak drilling activity in North America. Schlumberger said strong activity in Canada and solid results from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico had partially offset weakness in U.S. land drilling. “International strength, in combination with resilience to challenging market conditions in North America, led to solid performance in the first quarter,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said in a statement. Although natural gas prices rose 15 percent in the first quarter, drilling has not bounced back as gas producers have trimmed exploration budgets for 2013. Schlumberger warned last month that North American activity was weaker than expected in the first quarter as U.S. drillers returned to work at a slower pace than expected. Net income fell 3.3 percent to $1.26 billion, or 94 cents per share, for the quarter ended March 31. Profit, excluding items, was $1.01 per share. Revenue rose to $10.67 billion.

110,SLB,UPDATE 1-Schlumberger extends Venezuela's PDVSA $1 bln credit line,"By Deisy Buitrago MORICHAL, Venezuela, May 24 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA will receive a revolving credit line of at least $1 billion from oil services giant Schlumberger, the OPEC nation’s oil minister said on Friday. The deal will provide some financial breathing room for PDVSA, which as of last year had built up $16.5 billion in debts to service providers as it focused on social spending at the expense of paying off industry-related debts. “What we are signing today is an agreement for a revolving credit facility...that will allow us to receive more services from Schlumberger,” said Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez after signing the agreement with Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard. The agreement will allow PDVSA to continue contracting Schlumberger for work including drilling and pipeline services, even if it does not have cash flow to pay immediately. Service companies will be crucial to Venezuela’s efforts to boost output in the Orinoco belt, whose challenging conditions and tar-like crude require state-of-the-art technology to ensure cost-efficient production. The deal is also important for Schlumberger, which is increasingly relying on state-run oil companies as a source of revenue. Ramirez and Kibsgaard were visiting Orinoco oil belt installations in eastern Venezuela. The agreement appeared to ease tensions between PDVSA and Schlumberger, the world’s top oil services provider, over unpaid debts that began piling up after the global financial crisis. “Our company has been in Venezuela since 1929, more than 80 years, and we have intention of staying in Venezuela for another 200 years,” said Kibsgaard. The deal comes on the heels of recent financing agreements with Chinese and Russian oil companies that will provide $5.5 billion in financing for Orinoco belt joint ventures. PDVSA and Schlumberger also signed an agreement for an oil services joint venture. That marks an unusual step for a service company, which generally operates as a contractor rather than an oilfield partner. It also appears to run counter to Schlumberger’s 2011 decision to sell its rig management business as it sharpened focus on providing services for rigs instead of owning them. PDVSA in 2012 targeted a 500,000 barrel per day (bpd) production increase that was to take the country’s output to 3.5 million bpd through greater Orinoco oil output. But crude production for the year slipped slightly to 2.9  million bpd amid chronic delays in project start-up and PDVSA’s lack of cash flow that prevented it from making investments. The official 2013 target is an increase of 400,000 bpd to reach 3.3 million bpd. PDVSA under the presidency of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez became the primary financier of generous social development programs, helping make Chavez a hero to many but at times leaving oilfield operations underfunded.",5242013,http://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-schlumberger/update-1-schlumberger-extends-venezuelas-pdvsa-1-bln-credit-line-idUSL2N0E51MA20130524
111,SLB,"Schlumberger soars on global drilling boom, Baker hit at home","(Reuters) - A three-decade high for drilling activity outside North America lifted Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) to a seventh straight estimate-topping quarterly profit, while U.S.-focused Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N came up short in a tough quarter closer to home. Shares of global oilfield services leader, Schlumberger rose 4.3 percent to $81.88, touching a near-two-year high briefly, while Baker Hughes fell 4 percent to $47.14. UBS analyst Angie Sedita was impressed by Schlumberger’s strong execution in almost every region. “Additionally positive data points for continued strength in the international and deepwater markets support strong growth in the years ahead,” she wrote in an investor note. Schlumberger said second-quarter net income rose 49 percent to $2.1 billion, or $1.57 per share, in the second quarter, from $1.4 billion, or $1.05 per share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, its profit was $1.15 per share, whereas analysts had expected $1.10, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Schlumberger, which makes more than two-thirds of its revenue outside North America, is better insulated from the uncertain oilfield market in the home country of rivals Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes over the rest of 2013. Graphic: Oilfield comparison link.reuters.com/nyn79t Exploration and drilling rebounded in China and Australia and growth continued in the key markets of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said. Yet U.S. natural gas prices have remained weak due to excess supply from shale fields. Both Schlumberger and Baker Hughes saw strong activity in the Gulf of Mexico and improved deployment of hydraulic fracturing equipment, but Kibsgaard expected the fracking market to be oversupplied for the rest of this year. Incorporated in Curacao, Schlumberger has major offices in The Hague, Paris and Houston. Overall, the near-term U.S. outlook is positive, with Barclays this week tallying a 4 percent rise in drilling permits in June in the 30 states it surveys. Analysts sense drilling budgets may come under pressure before year-end, though Kibsgaard believed budgets for services would hold up. “So that obviously would be good for our business, because that is sort of where we make most of our money,” he said. Baker Hughes CEO Martin Craighead said he expected a strong rebound in North American operating margins in the third quarter as activity in Canada returns to normal. Baker’s Canadian revenue and profits declined significantly as rig counts dropped to their lowest levels in four years in the annual spring slowdown as melting ice disrupts oilfield activity. The company’s 45 percent fall in overall second-quarter profit was mainly due to lower margins in North America, as well as weakness in Latin America. The U.S. gas-directed rig count fell to an 18-year low of 353 in June, while the rig count outside North America climbed to 1,333, the highest level in 30 years, according to data compiled by Baker Hughes. Baker Hughes executives predicted the total U.S. rig count would average 8 percent lower in 2013, though because of the greater efficiency of drillers, the onshore well count would decline by only 4 percent to 35,000 this year. To save on costs, drillers increasingly sink more wells from single well sites - which also serves to improve the margins of companies selling services to them by making logistics easier. In a sign of the times, Baker Hughes on Thursday launched an onshore U.S. well count to complement its closely watched, seven-decade-old U.S. rig count. “When we compare well count and rig count data side-by-side, we can see that efficiencies in the U.S. are improving and that drilling rigs in some basins are drilling wells faster,” Craighead said in a statement. Second-quarter net income for Baker Hughes fell to $240 million, or 54 cents per share. Excluding certain items, earnings were 61 cents per share, below the average estimate of 65 cents. Revenue rose 3 percent to $5.5 billion. Prior to Friday, shares of Schlumberger and Baker Hughes had risen about 10 percent in the past three months. Shares of Halliburton, which reports earnings on Monday, have risen 19 percent on news the company may settle its liability related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

Schlumberger shares rose 2 percent to $80 in trading before the bell on Friday. The company’s exposure to the global offshore drilling boom has helped it offset a volatile North American market, where natural gas prices have remained weak due to excess supply from shale fields. Exploration and drilling activity rebounded in China and Australia and growth continued in the key markets of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said. The company derives nearly 70 percent of its revenue from international operations, unlike rivals Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N, which are more dependent on North America. “The soft global economic picture has changed little since the first quarter.

Baker Hughes, the world’s third-largest oilfield services provider, reported a 45 percent fall in second-quarter profit on Friday, mainly due to weak margins in North America. Total rig count in North America increased marginally in the second quarter due to growth in oil-focused drilling.

116,SLB,Schlumberger targets equipment reliability on par with autos,"Sept 12 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd plans to make better use of its equipment and ensure a performance quality in line with that of the automotive industry, which would mean a dramatic improvement for the world’s largest oilfield services company. As part of a broader corporate push by Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard to achieve annual earnings per share growth in double digits, he is targeting what he called “five sigma” reliability for all its service lines. “This improvement, which means a 90 percent reduction in failure frequency compared to current levels, will come in part from the improved reliability of our new-generation products, as well as from a step-change in the quality of our work processes and procedures,” Kibsgaard said on Thursday, according to a transcript of his remarks. The improved equipment will also work much harder. Over lunch at the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference in New York, Kibsgaard said Schlumberger would double its asset utilization by reducing the need for back-up equipment due to the better reliability, less maintenance downtime and a sharper supply chain. As for how the company has done so far in the third quarter, Kibsgaard saw strong activity in the Middle East and Asia, driven by Saudi Arabia, Iraq, China and Australia, while in Latin America, challenges in Mexico and Brazil were largely offset by work elsewhere in the region. Russia remained very strong, while there some shutdowns in the North Sea as well as security challenges in North Africa, and operational delays in sub-Saharan Africa, Kibsgaard said. U.S. land activity was solid, with pricing on a slowing downward trend, while activity in the Gulf of Mexico was at record levels, he added.

Shares of Baker Hughes jumped 8 percent to their highest level since 2011 in early trading on Friday while Schlumberger climbed 2.6 percent after both companies reported third-quarter results. Schlumberger and Baker Hughes executives cited healthy demand from the Middle East and Asia as well as work off the coast of North America, where prices for onshore services remain suppressed by a natural gas glut. Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said he expects double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2014. “Our customers are in their planning process, but at this stage we foresee a continuation of the overall trend seen in 2013, which revealed another year of steady activity growth,” he said on a conference call. In the third quarter, Schlumberger topped analysts’ profit estimates for the eighth consecutive quarter with a 20 percent rise, helped by unexpected positives out of the United States. “Schlumberger highlighted solid performance despite a flattish U.S. land rig count, driven by improved efficiency in its pressure pumping operations, new technology penetration and market share gains,” Barclays analyst James West wrote. A seasonal rebound in Canadian drilling also contributed to record-high quarterly revenue; about two-thirds of total revenue was generated outside North America. The company cited improvement in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Net income rose to $1.71 billion, or $1.29 per share, whereas analysts expected $1.24 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue grew 11 percent to $11.61 billion. UBS analyst Angie Sedita said earnings would only rise further with the efficiency drive outlined by Kibsgaard last month.

Smaller U.S.-focused players, exemplified by Superior Energy Services (SPN.N) and its profit warning earlier this week, are facing a tougher time as drillers become more efficient at well sites. Baker Hughes said it expects the U.S. rig count to average 1,750 rigs for 2013, down 9 percent from 2012, though the industry was drilling about 6 percent more wells per rig. The international count was expected to average 1,300 rigs in 2013, up 5 percent from last year.

The Houston-based company has ramped up operations outside North America, where the industry bellwether rig count it compiles is at three-decade highs. Smaller U.S.-focused players, exemplified by Superior Energy Services and its profit warning earlier this week , are facing a tougher time as drillers become more efficient at well sites. Baker Hughes said it expects the U.S. rig count to average 1,750 rigs for 2013, down 9 percent from 2012, though the industry was drilling about 6 percent more wells per rig. The international count was expected to average 1,300 rigs in 2013, up 5 percent from last year.

121,SLB,Schlumberger profit rises on strong drilling worldwide,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world’s largest oilfield services company, reported a better-than-expected 20 percent rise in quarterly profit as offshore drilling increased in North America and demand from the Middle East and Asia rose. The company, which topped analysts’ profit estimates for the eighth consecutive quarter, said a seasonal rebound in Canadian drilling also contributed to a record quarterly revenue. “Performance in North America was particularly strong,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said. Though he said prices for onshore services in North America remained weak in the third quarter, Schlumberger has been shielded from subdued demand thanks to its exposure to an offshore drilling boom in the United States, Canada and beyond. Schlumberger generates nearly 70 percent of its revenue from operations outside North America. The company said international drilling activity in the quarter was led by the Middle East and Asia, including its key markets of Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N, the world’s third-largest oilfield services company, also reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, driven by strong drilling activity in the Middle East and Asia Pacific.

125,SLB,"After bondholders, OSX, Schlumberger, Ensco top OGX creditor list","RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Bondholders, followed by oilfield-service companies, are the biggest creditors of Brazilian tycoon Eike Batista’s oil company OGX, which made Latin America’s biggest-ever bankruptcy filing last week, according to a list obtained by Reuters. The No. 2 creditor after bondholders is OSX Brasil SA, the Batista-controlled shipyard and ship-leasing company that built three offshore oil production platforms for OGX. OSX is owed at least 2.45 billion reais ($1.1 billion) or about 21 percent of the oil company’s obligations. The next largest creditor is Schlumberger NV, the world’s largest oilfield service company, which is owed at least 214.7 million reais or 1.9 percent of obligations, according to Reuters analysis of the list. The 8.17 billion reais ($3.6 billion) owed to holders of OGX’s bonds, which expire in 2018 and 2022, accounts for about 72 percent of the company’s consolidated obligations. The creditor list was part of the bankruptcy petition filed on October 30 in a Rio de Janeiro court by OGX Petróleo e Gas SA, as the company is formally known. OGX’s bankruptcy filing, the latest major development in one of the biggest corporate meltdowns in recent history, stemmed from the company’s inability to meet ambitious production targets set by Batista, who hailed OGX as the flagship of his once high-flying energy, commodities and logistics empire. With little revenue and a share price that plunged more than 98 percent in the last 16 months, OGX ran out of cash to pay debt, suppliers and other companies in his EBX group. Some EBX companies, including a port operator and a shipbuilder, depended on each other for revenue and the value of their shares also plummeted during the selloff. Batista, who was once worth about $30 billion and was the world’s seventh-richest man, in the process saw his fortune dry up, leaving him without the assets or credit necessary to keep financing his companies. He was unable, for instance, to fulfill a promise to bolster OGX by buying as much as $1 billion worth of new stock. Now, OGX hopes the bankruptcy can help it restructure. The top-five creditors after the bondholders is rounded out by Houston-based drill-rig operator Diamond Offshore Inc, owed 91.4 million reais; London-based drill-rig operator Ensco Plc, owed 63.9 million reais; and Fairfield, Connecticut-based General Electric Co, owed 54.1 million reais. Together, Schlumberger, Diamond, Ensco and GE hold about 4 percent of OGX’s obligations. The list contains nearly 250 specific creditors, including major companies such as Brazilian state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, also known as Petrobras, which is owed 40.9 million reais. Thomson Reuters Corp, the parent company of Reuters News, is owed 26,189 reais. Smaller creditors include a downtown Rio de Janeiro deli, several taxi cooperatives and FedEx Corp. each being owed several hundred or several thousand reais. OGX’s smallest creditor, Rosario Placas e Carimbos, a sign and rubber-stamp company, is owed 0.50 reais, or about 22 U.S. cents.

127,SLB,Angry Shi'ites storm Schlumberger camp at Iraq's Rumaila oilfield,"BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Dozens of angry Shi’ite Muslim workers and tribesmen stormed a Schlumberger Ltd camp at one of Iraq’s main oilfields and wrecked offices early on Monday after accusing a foreign security adviser of insulting their religion, police and employees at the field said. Oil officials and workers at the Schlumberger drilling site in Rumaila North said the problem started when a security adviser they identified as British asked Iraqi workers to take down a flag and banners depicting a figure revered by Shi’ites. Schlumberger was not immediately available for comment late on Monday. According to workers and officials, when the workers refused to remove the banners, the security adviser went to do so himself and tore one portraying Imam Hussein, whose death more than 1,000 years ago is currently being commemorated by Shi’ites across the world in rituals known as Ashura. In the ensuing row, the security adviser pulled out a gun and fired several shots, wounding an Iraqi worker and drawing dozens of people from a nearby village to join the workers in storming the Schlumberger drilling camp. Officials of the state-run Southern Oil Company said production from the field was not affected by the incident, but oil officials said Schlumberger had suspended its operations in response, not only in Rumaila but at the other oilfields in Basra province. “We received an order from the main administration to stop work until further notice,” said an Iraqi engineer working at a Schlumberger project in Zubair oilfield in the south. The protestors smashed up offices and severely beat the foreign security adviser, oil officials and workers said. A photograph taken by a worker at the scene showed a man with blood streaming down his face. He said it was the adviser. Security officials said the man was taken to hospital with serious injuries. Police and the army intervened to restore order and expelled the protesters from the site. “We advised the British security contractor to step back and leave this issue as it is very sensitive for the workers, but instead ... he went himself and removed the banners and tore one of Imam Hussein,” said an Iraqi worker, who witnessed the incident. “Workers were provoked and squabbled with the British guy, but he suddenly pulled out a pistol and started shooting, and wounded one Iraqi worker,” the man said. On Saturday, an Egyptian worker hired by Baker Hughes Inc to work at a drilling rig in Rumaila removed and tore a flag also depicting a holy Shi’ite figure, prompting Iraqi authorities to terminate his residency and expel him from the country, oil officials said. The workhorse of Iraq’s oil industry, Rumaila is operated by BP with China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) [CNPET.UL}. It has estimated reserves of 17 billion barrels and currently produces around 1.4 million bpd, more than a third of Iraq’s total output of over 3 million bpd. “The workers and villagers went on a rampage.

129,SLB,UPDATE 3-South Iraq oilfields calm; Schlumberger to return,"By Ahmed Rasheed and Peg Mackey BAGHDAD/LONDON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Iraq has moved swiftly to restore calm at its giant southern oilfields following violent protests, and the world’s top oil services company is expected to return to work next week at its biggest field, Rumaila, a senior Iraqi official said on Thursday. Dozens of angry Shi’ite Muslim workers and tribesmen stormed the Schlumberger Ltd camp in North Rumaila and wrecked offices early on Monday after accusing a foreign security adviser of insulting their religion, police and employees at the field said. But the situation at the BP-operated Rumaila oilfield - core to Iraq’s oil expansion plans - is now calm and safe for Schlumberger to get back to work, Thamir Ghadhban, chairman of the advisory commission to Iraq’s Council of Ministers, told Reuters. Rumaila pumps about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), more than a third of Iraq’s total output of over 3 million bpd. “Schlumberger management is still on the ground and operations are expected to resume next week,” said Ghadhban, speaking by telephone from Baghdad. A Schlumberger spokesman said the company was committed to Iraq and was reviewing options to resume operations under the necessary security conditions, with government support. The company sent two private planes to Basra to collect more than 300 workers earlier on Thursday, an airport official told Reuters. Ghadhban said most of the Schlumberger departures involved dependents and non-essential personnel. Several hundred other expatriates also left Basra this morning, the airport official said, but they were on normal flights, not sudden departures. Ghadhban, a former Iraqi oil minister, said there had been no reduction in production and exports during the Rumaila incident. Iraq, OPEC’s second-biggest oil producer, expects a robust return to growth next year as foreign companies at work in its southern oilfields push output toward the highest level ever. Oil officials and workers at the Schlumberger drilling site said the problem started when a security adviser they identified as British asked Iraqi workers to take down a flag and banners depicting a figure revered by Shi’ites. According to workers and officials, when the workers refused to remove the banners, the security adviser went to do so himself and tore one portraying Imam Hussein, whose death more than 1,000 years ago is currently being commemorated by Shi’ites around the world in rituals known as Ashura. “The Iraqi government will not allow anyone to take the law into their own hands, and stringent measures have been taken to ensure the safety of all foreign personnel and the security of all oil operations,” Ghadhban said. “At the same time, the foreign workers must respect the religious traditions of the Iraqi people,” he added. Officials were unable to comment on the resumption of work by Baker Hughes Inc, also hit by the protests. “The situation is still fluid, and our top concern remains the safety and welfare of our employees,” a Houston-based Baker Hughes spokeswoman said, offering no further details. On Saturday, an Egyptian worker hired by Baker Hughes to work at a drilling rig in Rumaila removed and tore a flag depicting a holy Shi’ite figure, prompting Iraqi authorities to terminate his residency and expel him from the country, oil officials said. A high-level security delegation headed by Iraq energy police commander Major General Hamid Ibrahim met with officials from Schlumberger and Baker Hughes at their camps near the oil hub of Basra to assure them that security had been tightened. “I assured them that the security of their companies and  staff is our utmost priority and that all necessary measures are being taken to prevent a recurrence of these incidents,” Hamid told Reuters. He was accompanied by officials from South Oil Co (SOC), which manages the southern oilfields, and the military commanders of the Basra operation. “We have met with international oil operators to discuss the recent incidents and the effect, if any, on production,” a senior SOC official told Reuters. “They all confirmed that production in the key oilfields of Rumaila, Zubair and West Qurna is going according to plan without interruption.” Baghdad has ordered a probe into the assault against Schlumberger’s security staff, said Hamid. He criticised Schlumberger’s security company for failing to protect the camp and for insensitivity to the community’s religious sensibilities.

Iraq, OPEC’s second-biggest oil producer, expects a robust return to growth next year as foreign companies at work in its southern oilfields push output toward the highest level ever. Still, safety is one of the main concerns, highlighted last week when dozens of Shi’ite Muslim workers and tribesmen stormed the Schlumberger Ltd camp in North Rumaila after accusing a foreign security adviser of insulting their religion. Gazprom Neft said in a Eurobond prospectus it had postponed a December launch due to “the failure on the part of certain contractors to fulfill their contractual obligations and certain issues related to the safety and security of employees and property.” It also cited delays by Iraqi authorities over tender approvals, holdups to customs clearance for import cargo and a shortage of local contractors. Gaining foreign business is key for Gazprom Neft to reach its production target of 100 million tonnes per year (2 million barrels per day) by 2020, double current levels. It said in April that by 2017 as much as 170,000 bpd of crude oil could be produced for seven years at Badra. Iraqi officials have said calm is being restored and that the situation at the BP-operated Rumaila oilfield - core to the country’s oil expansion plans - is now safe for Schlumberger to get back to work. Apart from Gazprom Neft, Russia’s No.2 oil producer Lukoil  is preparing to launch its West Qurna-2 oilfield in Iraq later this year or early in 2014.

132,SLB,Schlumberger sees 2 pct fourth-quarter profit hit from Iraq shutdown,"Dec 3 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd expects the temporary shutdown of its operations in southern Iraq last month in a “security incident” to reduce fourth-quarter profits about 2 percent, the oilfield services company on Tuesday. “With strong support from the authorities, we are almost back to normal activity levels at this stage, and expect to see continued strong growth for our business in Iraq next year,” Patrick Schorn, Schlumberger’s president of operations and integration, told an investor conference. Dozens of Shi’ite Muslim workers and tribesmen stormed the Schlumberger camp in North Rumaila and wrecked offices on Nov. 11 after accusing a foreign security adviser of insulting their religion, according to police and employees. Speaking at the Cowen and Co Ultimate Energy Conference, Schorn said the shutdown would have an impact of 2 cents to 3 cents per share for the quarter. The average analyst estimate for the quarter is $1.37 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Otherwise, he reiterated that Schlumberger expects spending growth in 2014, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, sub-Saharan Africa, Russia, the Middle East and China. The company believed it would benefit from a focus on cash flow among clients, which would mean more money for wells than for costly infrastructure. But Schlumberger anticipates a flattening of spending on seismic underground mapping work, and said negative pricing in North America continued across most product lines.

133,SLB,"UPDATE 3-Schlumberger profit surges, helped by Middle East & Asia","By Ernest Scheyder and Swetha Gopinath Jan 17 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd, the world’s largest oilfield services company, posted a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Friday as robust international activity offset stiff competition in North America. Fracking, drilling seismic studies and other lucrative services for oil producers across most of the Middle East, Asia and Latin America helped the company’s profit top analysts’ estimates for the ninth straight quarter. Intense competition with Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc for work in North America’s vast shale fields, though, combined with weak natural gas prices, eroded regional results. Without strong sales from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, North American revenue would have dipped. “The main challenge in the North America land market is still pricing,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a conference call with investors. Negotiations for new contracts with several key North American customers should further dent results, with pricing falling, he said. Statoil and other international energy firms are Schlumberger’s largest North American customers and have used the oversupply of oilfield services to their advantage. Despite tepid North American growth, Schlumberger expects the global economy to improve in 2014 and oil demand to rise, with double-digit earnings growth across the company for the year, Kibsgaard said. Schlumberger has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers. International markets brought in about two-thirds of Schlumberger’s 2013 revenue of $45.27 billion. Middle Eastern revenue jumped 5 percent in the quarter, helped by activity in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but a temporary shutdown of operations in southern Iraq in November, following a protest, slightly dented fourth-quarter results, the company said. Schlumberger suspended activity in Iraq in November after dozens of Shi’ite Muslim workers and tribesmen, accusing a foreign security adviser of insulting their religion, stormed the Schlumberger camp in North Rumaila and wrecked offices. Seasonal slowdowns in North America, the North Sea, Russia and China also weighed on results. The company expects oil producers’ exploration and production spending, the lion’s share of its business, to increase this year for international markets and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Barclays expects oil and gas companies to spend about $723 billion on exploration and production this year, an increase of 6.1 percent from 2013, according to report released last month. Schlumberger’s net income rose to $1.66 billion, or $1.26 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec.31, from $1.36 billion, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, profit from continuing operations was $1.35 per share. Revenue rose about 7 percent to $11.91 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.32 per share on revenue of $12.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results come the day after Schlumberger boosted its quarterly dividend by 28 percent to 40 cents. The company, which reviews its dividend every January, has no set level for future dividend payouts, Kibsgaard said. “There is no target number,” he said. Baker Hughes and Halliburton are scheduled to report their fourth-quarter results on Jan. 21. Baker Hughes, considered the smallest of the “big three” oil service providers, earlier this month estimated a smaller-than-expected quarterly profit, citing the suspension of its operations in Iraq.

Intense competition with Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N for work in North America’s vast shale fields, though, combined with weak natural gas prices, eroded regional results. Without strong sales from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, North American revenue would have dipped. “In the United States, we see no change in fundamentals, with any meaningful recovery in dry gas drilling activity some way out in the future,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said in a statement. Schlumberger has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers. International markets brought in about two-thirds of Schlumberger’s 2013 revenue of $45.27 billion. Middle Eastern revenue jumped 5 percent in the quarter, helped by activity in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but a temporary shutdown of operations in southern Iraq in November, following a protest, slightly dented fourth-quarter results, the company said. Schlumberger suspended activity in Iraq in November after dozens of Shi’ite Muslim workers and tribesmen, accusing a foreign security adviser of insulting their religion, stormed the Schlumberger camp in North Rumaila and wrecked offices. Seasonal slowdowns in North America, the North Sea, Russia and China also weighed on results. The company expects oil producers’ exploration and production spending, the lion’s share of its business, to increase this year for international markets and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Barclays (BARC.L) expects oil and gas companies to spend about $723 billion on exploration and production this year, an increase of 6.1 percent from 2013, according to report released last month. Schlumberger’s net income rose to $1.66 billion, or $1.26 per share, in the fourth quarter ended December31, from $1.36 billion, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, profit from continuing operations was $1.35 per share. Revenue rose about 7 percent to $11.91 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.32 per share on revenue of $12.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters Baker Hughes and Halliburton are scheduled to report their fourth-quarter results on January 21. Baker Hughes, considered the smallest of the “big three” oil service providers, earlier this month estimated a smaller-than-expected quarterly profit, citing the suspension of its operations in Iraq. Schlumberger shares rose 1.1 percent to $89.53 in premarket trading on Friday. Schlumberger shares have risen 21 percent in the past year, compared with a 17 percent rise in the Philadelphia oil service index .OSX.

The deal would take control of the company, formerly OGX , out of the hands of Eike Batista, the former Brazilian billionaire whose swift rise to vast wealth was matched by his fall from those same ranks. Citing people with knowledge of the talks, Bloomberg reported that Deutsche Bank AG will act as an intermediary. Representatives from Pimco did not immediately return a phone message. Deutsche Bank declined to comment, and Óleo e Gás did not immediately respond to emails. The Brazilian company was expected to submit a debt restructuring plan this month after having delayed the plan in January. Óleo e Gás owes about $5.1 billion to investors such as bond fund Pimco, suppliers including Schlumberger NV, and sister company and shipbuilder OSX Brasil SA.

138,SLB,Schlumberger expects Q1 earnings to jump from last year,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world’s largest oilfield services company, said on Monday it expects first-quarter earnings to be much higher than in the same period last year, as it takes market share from rivals and cuts costs. Much of the growth will come from state-owned and independent energy companies that are spending to develop shale and other resources around the world, rather than multinational energy companies, most of whom are cutting spending, Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said at an energy conference in New Orleans. “We still expect strong, year-over-year growth in earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2013, which further supports our positive view for the year,” Kibsgaard said. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings of $1.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company earned $1.01 per share in the first quarter of 2013. The positive outlook came despite cold, wintry weather in North America and Russia that dented demand for the company’s drilling, completion and other services for oil and natural gas producers. Kibsgaard, who touted the company’s use of technology to boost efficiency and take market share from rivals, said he would update Wall Street next month on the outlook. Schlumberger, with an extensive international reach, gets almost 70 percent of its revenue from outside North America and is less exposed to North America than rivals Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N. The North American natural gas glut has forced many drillers to idle rigs until natural gas prices recover from recent lows. While prices jumped sharply last winter in the United States due to cold weather, they fell when temperatures rose. Kibsgaard said he does not expect the winter price spike to cause a sudden surge in new natural gas drilling. As of the end of last week, the number of U.S. rigs drilling for natural gas fell by 18 to 326 rigs, the lowest level since May 1995, according to Baker Hughes data. Shares of Schlumberger rose 2 percent to $95.52 in morning trading on Monday.

141,SLB,UPDATE 4-Schlumberger & Baker Hughes results point to improving North America,"* Schlumberger first-quarter profit $1.21/share vs est. $1.20 * Baker Hughes first-quarter adjusted profit $0.84/shr est. $0.78 * Both upbeat on Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling   (Recasts to adds details on outlook risks, new share prices) By Sayantani Ghosh and Ashutosh Pandey April 17 (Reuters) - Oilfield services providers Schlumberger Ltd and Baker Hughes Inc each posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, though they said pockets of weakness loom in Brazil, Canada, Russia and other drilling regions. The results highlight a rapidly changing landscape for the oilfield service industry, where companies are competing for a smaller number of new contracts in North American shale fields. At the same time, they are moving into newer, more-lucrative Eastern Hemisphere regions that have higher logistical risks. Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, which provide drilling technology and equipment, well construction services and seismic surveys for oil and natural gas companies, have for months been complaining of market weakness in North America. Additionally, Royal Dutch Shell and other large, international oil companies, after a decade of double-digit growth in capital budgets, have begun cutting spending as oil prices stagnate and project costs rise, a bad sign for oilfield service companies. Executives from Schlumberger, the world’s No. 1 oilfield services company by revenue, and Baker Hughes told analysts on conference calls they expect results to slightly improve this year in parts of North America but they warned of potential problems in other regions. Schlumberger said deepwater drilling off Brazil should decline 20 percent this year compared with last year and that revenue could drop in Russia due to weakness in the rouble. Both countries are important markets for Schlumberger. “Brazil revenue for us this year is going to be significantly down versus 2013,” Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said on a call with analysts, citing slipping demand and less-lucrative contracts signed last year. Baker Hughes said its revenue this quarter would decline slightly in North America, where it gets half its annual revenue, partly due to a slowdown in Canada. Three years after the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history, large oil and gas companies are ramping up operations in the Gulf of Mexico, which they expect to yield more than 700,000 barrels per day of crude. “The Gulf of Mexico will play a big role in our North American margin growth,” Baker Hughes Chief Executive Officer Martin Craighead said. While Schlumberger’s revenue from deepwater drilling in the region fell in the first quarter due to operational delays, it  expects the situation to normalize this quarter. “The outlook for deepwater drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico remains strong for the full year,” Kibsgaard said. Baker Hughes, which said it had a good first quarter in the Gulf, expects business in the region to continue to improve and boost margins particularly in the second half of the year. The company’s North American revenue rose 12 percent to $3.68 billion in the first quarter. Baker Hughes posted a 7 percent rise in revenue to $2.78 billion from the region. Baker Hughes’ shares rose 4.1 percent to $69.05 in afternoon trading. Schlumberger’s shares, which hit their highest point in nearly six years on Thursday morning, fell 0.4 percent to $100.53. The stock has risen about 12 percent in the past month, outperforming shares of Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes. In the past few quarters, unusually cold weather in North America and Russia disrupted drilling, hurting oil and gas companies while pushing up natural gas prices in North America and depleted stockpiles to their lowest level since 2003. Kibsgaard said the fundamentals of the global economic recovery were intact despite the harsh winter, slowing growth in China, and problems in Ukraine. Schlumberger, which cut its 2014 capital spending budget by about 3 percent to $3.8 billion, said it expected spending on well-related activity to rise by more than 6 percent this year. Schlumberger’s first-quarter revenue fell short of analysts’ average estimate due to reduced drilling activity and pricing pressure in Latin America. Revenue from the region declined 8 percent to $1.76 billion, the lowest in eight quarters. Latin America accounted for nearly 16 percent of Schlumberger’s total sales in the first quarter ended March 31. Schlumberger’s profit from continuing operations rose 32.5 percent to $1.59 billion, or $1.21 per share, in the first quarter. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.20 per share. The company’s total revenue rose about 6 percent to $11.24 billion, but missed an average estimate of $11.49 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Baker Hughes also posted a 10 percent drop in quarterly revenue from Latin America. The company’s adjusted profit rose 27 percent to 84 cents per share, while revenue rose nearly 10 percent to $5.73 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 78 cents on revenue of $5.71 billion.

142,SLB,"Schlumberger, Baker Hughes results point to improving North America","(Reuters) - Oilfield services companies Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N reported better-than-expected quarterly profits and signaled an improvement in the North American market, driven by increased drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services company, gets a third of its revenue from North America. The region accounts for half of rival Baker Hughes’ annual revenue. The companies provide drilling technology and equipment, well construction services and seismic surveys to oil and gas companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N). Three years after the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history, large oil and gas companies are ramping up operations in the Gulf, which is poised to deliver more than 700,000 barrels per day of crude. While Schlumberger’s revenue from deepwater drilling in the region fell in the first quarter due to operational delays, the company expects the situation to normalize in the current quarter. “The outlook for deepwater drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico remains strong for the full year,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a conference call with analysts. Baker Hughes, which said it had a good first quarter in the Gulf, expects business to continue to improve in the region and boost margins, particularly in the second half of the year. Barclays analysts were upbeat on both stocks, saying the companies had done well in North America despite a colder-than-usual winter. “The industry bellwether posted a solid earnings number in a tough quarter (and) signaled a ‘robust’ North American market ...,” they said in a research note, referring to Schlumberger. The company’s North American revenue rose 12 percent to $3.68 billion in the first quarter. Baker Hughes posted a 7 percent rise in revenue to $2.78 billion from the region. Baker Hughes’ shares rose as much as 5 percent to $69.43 on the New York Stock Exchange - their highest since August 2011. Schlumberger’s shares, which rose less than 1 percent in morning trade to their highest in nearly six years, were marginally down at $100.34 in morning trading. The stock has risen about 12 percent in the past month, outperforming shares of Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes. In the past couple of quarters, colder-than-usual weather in North America and Russia disrupted drilling, hurting oil and gas companies. The cold weather, however, pushed up natural gas prices in North America and depleted stockpiles to their lowest level since 2003, after years of glut that forced many drillers to idle rigs. Kibsgaard said the fundamentals of the global economic recovery were intact despite the harsh winter, slowing growth in China, and problems in Ukraine. “These factors, however, are likely temporary in nature ... but supply and demand is expected to normalize over the coming months,” he said in a statement. Oilfield services companies are expected to feel the heat as large oil companies, after a decade of double-digit growth, cut spending amid stagnating oil prices and higher project costs. The company has already seen a reduction in spending from integrated oil companies, Kibsgaard said, adding that he expects them to cut spending more on infrastructure and less on well-related projects. Schlumberger, which cut its 2014 capital spending budget by about 3 percent to $3.8 billion, said it expected spending on well-related activity to rise by more than 6 percent this year. Schlumberger’s first-quarter revenue fell short of the average analyst estimate due to reduced drilling activity and pricing pressure in Latin America.

By giving credit lines to PDVSA, the companies will be able to increase their service contracts with OPEC member Venezuela. The deal may allow PDVSA, whose cash-flow problems are well known, to postpone payments of accumulated debts to its main service providers. Last year, it signed a similar agreement with Schlumberger after accumulating pending debts of almost $1 billion. PDVSA finances most of the socialist government’s spending and does not receive cash for a third of its crude and products exports due to debt agreements and international supply pacts. In 2012, PDVSA had accumulated $16.5 billion in debts to providers, but it has not released updated numbers since. Ramirez did not say when the new $2 billion credit would be effective or give details of the interest rate agreed.

146,SLB,COLUMN-Energy scare good for oil stocks in the short term,"(The writer is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.) By John Wasik CHICAGO, June 23 (Reuters) - Despite the incendiary conflict in Iraq that last week sent the benchmark price of Brent crude oil to more than $115 a barrel, a nine-month high, U.S. stock markets largely shrugged off the oil threat, hitting record closing highs last week. For investors, a new energy crisis in the Middle East presents something of an opportunity, albeit a fragile, short-term one. Energy production has become much more geographically diverse, particularly in the United States. That lessens the severity of a Mideast production shortfall while boosting the long-term prospects of investment in fossil-fuel companies. As is the case during any threat to global oil production - Iraq is still OPEC’s second-largest producer - the share prices of oil companies and the funds that invest in them soar on bad news, which is what happened last week. Petroleum producers score in the short term when this happens. Owing to greater demand for oil and geopolitical tensions, ExxonMobil Corp, the largest energy company by market valuation, climbed 10.5 percent over the three months through June 20, compared to a 5.3 percent gain in the S&P; 500 Index. BP PLC (the ADR) was up nearly 15 percent over the three months ended June 20. The last three months are important because they include a spate of good reports on economic growth in Europe and the U.S. and a run-up to the political strife in the Middle East. These events, and growing demand from developing countries such as China and India, have pressured oil prices upward. The Vanguard Energy ETF, which holds a broad portfolio of oil and gas exploration, refining and pipeline companies, gained 16 percent in the quarter through June 20. It holds companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron Corp and Schlumberger NV, and nearly all its holdings are based in North America. It’s up about 16 percent in the three months through June 20. For a fund that’s not dominated by the most popular energy stocks, consider the Guggenheim S&P; 500 Equal Weight Energy ETF , which holds a global portfolio of energy producers in roughly equal proportions. The Guggenheim portfolio places more emphasis on smaller, lesser-known companies like Newfield Exploration Co, Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Nabors Industries Ltd . The fund is up nearly 16 percent for the three months through June 20. Independent companies like these may have more drilling activities in the areas where shale oil and gas are being discovered throughout North America. Over a short period of time, it makes sense to hold energy stocks as a defense against rising oil prices. After all, companies make profits on price surges. But on the consumer level, higher petroleum prices can act as a damaging boomerang. When prices soar beyond a certain level, it brakes economic activity across the board. Higher fuel prices force people to drive less and stay away from stores, raise prices for everything from farm goods to plastics, and act as a tax on economic growth. During the last draconian oil-price run-up in 2008 - when crude oil prices topped $140 a barrel - the combination of an energy shock, a banking/credit meltdown and massive unemployment from Athens to San Francisco created a recession in Europe and North America. Towards the end of that year, energy prices bludgeoned an already-hobbled economic situation and the Vanguard Energy fund lost nearly 40 percent of its value, slightly more than the S&P; 500 Index. Looking ahead, what may mitigate any traumas in terms of oil prices will be growing U.S. oil and gas production, particularly in regions where “fracking” technology has liberated more hydrocarbons from shale formations from the Appalachians to North Dakota. Production in the U.S. was up a record 1.1 million barrels per day last year, offseting declines in global output from Libya, Nigeria and Iraq - all due to political strife. “The huge investments seen in the U.S. have been encouraged and enabled by a favorable policy regime,” BP economist Christof Ruhl told Reuters. “And this has resulted in the U.S. delivering the world’s largest increase in oil production last year. Indeed, the U.S. increase ... was one of the biggest annual oil production increases the world has ever seen.” Across the globe, the future for energy stocks is positive long term. Consumers in China, India and Africa are buying petroleum-hungry vehicles. And until less-costly alternatives present themselves, fossil fuels will power the engines of these developing economies. Short-term political conflicts are unlikely to extinguish these trends.

147,SLB,Rebounding North America boosts Schlumberger revenue,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd’s, the world’s largest oilfield services company, reported better-than-expected second quarter revenue as drilling activity picked up in North America. Revenue from the oversupplied market — where all major oilfield service providers have been competing for fewer contracts — jumped 16 percent to $3.89 billion from a year earlier. Smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc also reported a higher-than-expected profit on strong growth in North America, earlier on Thursday. Schlumberger and Baker Hughes provide several services, including seismic surveys that determine where oil lies under the earth’s surface and hydraulic fracturing of wells. Robust drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico and a rise in onshore drilling in the United States helped offset seasonal weakness in Canada, Schlumberger said in a statement on Thursday. Schlumberger has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers, which include Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc. International markets brought in about two-thirds of Schlumberger’s quarterly revenue, with a 12 percent rise in revenue from the Middle East and Asia and 4 percent rise in Europe. Revenue from Latin America fell 3 percent. Total revenue for the second quarter ended June 30 rose 8 percent to $12.05 billion, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $11.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income fell by nearly a quarter to about $1.60 billion, or $1.21 per share, from $2.10 billion, or $1.57 per share.

148,SLB,UPDATE 1-Rebounding North America boosts Schlumberger revenue,"(Adds details from statement, background) July 17 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd’s, the world’s largest oilfield services company, reported better-than-expected second quarter revenue as drilling activity picked up in North America. Revenue from the oversupplied market - where all major oilfield service providers have been competing for fewer contracts - jumped 16 percent to $3.89 billion from a year earlier. Smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc also reported a higher-than-expected profit on strong growth in North America, earlier on Thursday. Schlumberger and Baker Hughes provide several services, including seismic surveys that determine where oil lies under the earth’s surface and hydraulic fracturing of wells. Robust drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico and a rise in onshore drilling in the United States helped offset seasonal weakness in Canada, Schlumberger said in a statement on Thursday. Schlumberger has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers, which include Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc. International markets brought in about two-thirds of Schlumberger’s quarterly revenue, with a 12 percent rise in revenue from the Middle East and Asia and 4 percent rise in Europe. Revenue from Latin America fell 3 percent. Total revenue for the second quarter ended June 30 rose 8 percent to $12.05 billion, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $11.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income fell by nearly a quarter to about $1.60 billion, or $1.21 per share, from $2.10 billion, or $1.57 per share. Earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.37, higher than the analyst average estimate of $1.36 per share.

150,SLB,COLUMN-Will you get burned by following the hot money in ETFs?,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By John Wasik CHICAGO, July 21 (Reuters) - All too often, I see investors heading in the wrong direction en masse. They buy stocks at the top of the market or bonds when interest rates are heading up. Occasionally, though, active investors may be heading in the right direction. A case in point has been the flow of money into certain exchange-traded funds in the first half of this year. Reflecting most hot money trends, billions of dollars moved because of headlines. The Energy Select SPDR exchange-traded fund, which I discussed three weeks ago, gathered more than $3 billion in assets in the first half, when crude oil prices climbed and demand for hydrocarbons remained high. The Energy SPDR, which charges 0.16 percent for annual management expenses and holds Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and Schlumberger NV, has climbed 22 percent in the past 12 months, with nearly one-third of that gain coming in the three months through July 18. Long-term, this may be a solid holding as developing countries such as China and India demand more oil. “We think the Energy Select SPDR is a play of oil prices remaining high and supporting growth for integrated oil & gas and exploration and production companies,” analysts from S&P; Capital IQ said in a recent “MarketScope Advisor” newsletter. Headlines also favored European stocks as represented by the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF, which holds leading eurozone stocks such as Nestle SA, Novartis AG  and Roche Holding AG. The fund has been the top asset gatherer thus far this year, with $4 billion in new money, according to S&P; Capital IQ. As Europe continues to recover over the next few years and the European Central Bank keeps rates low, global investors will continue to benefit from this growing optimism. The Vanguard fund has gained nearly 16 percent for the 12 months through July 18. It charges 0.09 percent in annual expenses and is a solid holding if you have little or no European exposure in your stock portfolio. Not all hot money trends make sense, however. As the economy accelerates and interest-rate hikes look increasingly likely, investors are still piling money into bond funds, which lose money under those circumstances. The iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF, which holds middle-maturity U.S. Treasury bonds, continued to rank in the top 10 funds in terms of new money in the first half. The fund, which holds nearly $5 billion, is up nearly 4 percent for the 12 months through July 18, compared with 4.2 percent for the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Total return index, a benchmark for U.S. Treasuries. The fund charges 0.15 percent in annual expenses. While investors were able to squeeze a bit more out of bond returns in the first half of this year, they may be living on borrowed time. The U.S. Federal Reserve confirmed recently that it would be ending purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in October. This stimulus program, known as “QE2,” has kept interest rates artificially low as the economy has had a chance to recover. The phasing out of QE2 could be bearish for bond funds. Will interest rates climb to reflect growing demand for credit and possibly higher inflation down the road? How will the ending of the Fed’s cheap money program affect U.S. and emerging markets shares? Many pundits believe public corporations may pull back from their enthusiastic stock buybacks and trigger a correction. Yet low inflation and modest employment gains may mute bond market fears. “The Fed is on track to complete tapering in the fourth quarter, and we think there is essentially no chance that it will move the fed funds rate higher this year,” Bob Doll, chief equity strategist with Nuveen Investments in Chicago, said in a recent newsletter. “With the 10-year Treasury ending the quarter at 2.5 percent, the yield portion of this forecast is more uncertain,” Doll added, “although we expect yields will end the year higher than where they began.” While there could be any number of wild cards spoiling the party for stocks, it is wise to ignore short-term trends and prepare for the eventual climb in interest rates. That means staying away from bond funds with long average maturities along with vehicles like preferred stocks and high-yield bonds that are highly sensitive to interest rates. Longer-term, shares of companies in consumer discretionary, materials and information technology businesses likely to benefit from a global economic resurgence will probably be a good bet. Just keep in mind that the hot money can be wrong, so build a long-haul diversified portfolio that protects against the downside of a torrid trend going from hot to cold.

151,SLB,UPDATE 4-Halliburton signals N. America demand recovery after two years,"* Second-quarter revenue up 10 pct, beats expectations * Raises share buyback program to $6 bln from $5 bln * Sees risk from U.S. sanctions on Russia later this year * Sees N. America margins of 20 pct in Q3 vs 18.2 pct in Q2 * Shares hit life-high   (Updates link to graphic) By Swetha Gopinath and Ashutosh Pandey July 21 (Reuters) - Halliburton Co, North America’s top oilfield services provider, said it would add fracking equipment and crew to take advantage of higher demand in the region, signaling an industry-wide recovery after a two-year slump. Shares of the world’s No.2 oilfield services provider rose 2 percent to a life-high of $72.20 after the company also raised its share repurchase program to $6 billion from $5 billion. Halliburton, like global leader Schlumberger Ltd, said while there was no impact on business yet due to the U.S. sanctions against Russia, projects being tendered later this year could be impacted. The country contributes in the “low single digit” percentage to Halliburton’s total revenue. “As tensions potentially escalate and the risk of more sanctions sort of looms, that’s what we believe puts some risk into the business in the back half of the year,” Chief Executive David Lesar said on a post-earnings call. Halliburton reported a 20 percent rise in second-quarter profit, meeting Wall Street’s expectations, as drilling activity increased in North America. Halliburton, which gets half its revenue from North America, said it expects margins in the region to touch 20 percent in the current quarter, up from 18.2 percent in the quarter ended June 30. The company’s margin in the region was higher than Baker Hughes Inc’s 12 percent and Schlumberger’s 18 percent. Halliburton said it would “immediately” speed up additions to its crew and hydraulic fracturing fleet as capacity tightened in North America. “I think it is a kind of vote of confidence that demand is on its way back,” said S&P; Capital IQ analyst Stewart Glickman. Prices for hydraulic fracturing, where water, chemicals and sand are blasted into wells to extract oil and gas, have been depressed due to excess equipment and a drop in natural gas drilling, brought on by low prices of the fuel. However, a recent rise in natural gas prices has led to increased drilling, helping boost revenue at Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes. Halliburton’s revenue from North America rose sequentially to 11 percent in the second quarter - stronger than a 9 percent rise in the eastern hemisphere, where it had been making a strong push to combat the weakness in North America. The weakest region was Latin America, where revenue rose just 4 percent, dragged down by reduced activity, a delayed order and costs related to new projects in Mexico. Margins in the region are expected to improve in the second half, with full-year margins in line with those a year earlier. The company’s revenue rose 10 percent to $8.05 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $7.88 billion. Halliburton also said it would move the role of president to Chief Operating Officer Jeff Miller from Chief Executive David Lesar, effective Aug. 1.

153,SLB,Schlumberger expects Russia sanctions to hurt earnings,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd, the world’s No.1 oilfield services provider, became the first major U.S. company to say that its quarterly earnings would be hurt by U.S. and EU sanctions against Russia.  The company’s warning comes after BP Plc said last month the sanctions could hurt its business. BP is the biggest foreign investor in Russia with a near-20 percent stake in Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer. The United States has put sanctions on Rosneft and Novatek, Russia’s second-largest gas producer, over Russia’s support for rebels in Ukraine.  Schlumberger, which drills with Rosneft on the island of Sakhalin, said on Tuesday that the sanctions would hurt its third-quarter profit by as much as 3 cents per share. Analysts on average estimate earnings of $1.51 per share in the quarter ending September, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Schlumberger generates about 4 to 5 percent of its revenue from Russia, amounting to about $2.2 billion in annual revenue, according to Simmons & Co. Schlumberger said the sanctions were “restricting the engagement of people and equipment”, but added that it was confident that it could support its clients in Russia without “material disruption”.  Schlumberger said in July that there was no “real impact” on its business in Russia.  However, the European Union and the United States have announced further sanctions since then, targeting Russia’s energy, banking and defense sectors.  Schlumberger is more exposed to Russia than its nearest rival Halliburton Co, which is more focused on North America. Smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc gets about 5 percent of its revenue from Russia, while Weatherford International Ltd gets 3 to 3.5 percent, according to Simmons & Co.  “It is our understanding that the sanctions, which are not retroactive, affect new exports and investments in deep water, arctic, and non-conventional, or shale, exploration and development,” the analysts wrote in a note. Schlumberger is working on technology for the Bazhenov shale development project in Western Siberia along with Gazprom Neft, the oil-producing arm of Russian state gas company Gazprom. There are no sanctions against Gazprom. Before the onset of the sanctions, Russia was seen as a growing market for the oil service industry with companies such as ExxonMobil planning to start drilling wells in the Russian Arctic. Schlumberger shares were marginally down at $108.20 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

158,SLB,Oil exploration makes a tentative return to Alsace region,"* Region supplied 5 percent of French oil needs in 1920s * Very small volumes produced today, but highly profitable * Suspicion surrounding shale gas holds back permits By Gilbert Reilhac Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France, Oct 1 (Reuters) - S ustainably high oil prices have lured small oil explorers back to Alsace, the cradle of the French oil exploration industry that gave birth to corporate giants such as Schlumberger. The activity near the Rhine on the German border does not amount to an oil boom. The region provides 1 percent of French oil production, which is just under 2 percent of European output. Nonetheless, 13 wells are pumping, two exploration permits have recently been granted and more are being reviewed by the French administration. “For us, Alsace was a sleeping beauty,” said Stephane Touche, whose company Millennium Geo-Venture holds the two recent exploration permits and has applied for five more. Among its advantages, the region’s oil reserves are already completely mapped and are very close to the surface. Oil leaks have long provided a favourite mud-bath playground for wild boars in the Alsatian forest. Oil production in Alsace started in the 18th century and peaked in the 1920s, when more than 650 wells and four refineries supplied 5 percent of French oil needs and provided work for 3,000 people around Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, 50 km north of Strasbourg. In that era, the Schlumberger brothers carried out the first electrical well log and created the company. The drop in oil prices and large discoveries in what was then French Sahara led to the end of the region’s oil industry in the 1960s. The Rhine valley has produced about 80 million barrels of oil so far, Touche said. Millennium recently drilled its first well near Soufflenheim, and production is expected to start this autumn. The 46-year-old engineer founded the company with investors from Norwegian company Moore Energy, which has applied for more licences in the Paris basin for conventional oil and gas. Another advantage for the oil industry is that French taxes are light by comparison with more established oil-producing countries. Crude production in France becomes commercially viable at around $70 a barrel, according to industry figures. “A barrel produced in France is 10 to 20 times more profitable than a barrel produced in Africa,” said Philippe Labat, who founded a small company called Oelweg and runs a well near Oberlauterbach. The 60-year-old had been a production engineer at Elf, now known as Total, when it tried and failed to revive French oil production in the 1980s. Oelweg, which has applied for three more permits in Alsace, has re-opened a well abandoned by Elf and has added a heater to improve its productivity. The beam pump, surrounded by corn fields, produces 10 barrels per day with only one part-time worker, giving Oelweg a net profit of 163,500 euros ($207,400) in 2012 on revenue of 375,000 euros. Since the closure of the region’s Reichstett refinery in 2011, oil from Alsace is send to the Karlsruhe refinery in Germany. “Thanks to Alsace, France exports crude oil,” Labat quipped. The French authorities have not made oil exploration any easier in recent years, however. France banned hydraulic fracking in 2011, and fears about shale gas among environmentalists and the public have made even conventional oil drilling suspect. Last year, a request by U.S. firm Hess Corp to explore for shale oil and gas in the Paris basin, France’s main production area, was rejected by the government despite assurances it would not use fracking. The fracking technique, which involves pumping water and chemicals underground, was banned under former President Nicolas Sarkozy due to concerns over the environmental impact including possible contamination of groundwater and earthquakes. The ban was upheld by the constitutional court in 2013, after a challenge by another U.S-based company, Schuepbach Energy, which held two permits that were cancelled. French oil lobby UFIP estimates that 112 hydrocarbon permit requests are currently frozen by the French administration, having been withheld sometimes for several years, although a few have been awarded this year. But the debate about oil and gas exploration on French soil shows no sign of abating. Sarkozy, in a policy U-turn, came out in favour of shale gas in his first political rally since his return to French politics this month, while energy minister Segolene Royal confirmed her opposition. Back in Alsace, however, the local population has no qualms about its black gold. “It’s part of our history,” the mayor of Soufflenheim, Camille Scheydecker, said.

Schlumberger, which provides drilling technology and equipment, well construction services and seismic surveys for oil and natural gas companies, said revenue from its U.S. operations rose 18 percent to $4.26 billion in the quarter, accounting for a third of total revenue. Revenue from the company’s international business rose 5 percent to $8.31 billion, as its resilient Middle East and Asia businesses trumped “significant headwinds” in Northern Iraq and sanctions against Russia, Schlumberger said.

Baker Hughes reported a lower-than-expected profit for the first time in five quarters earlier on Thursday, as political tensions in Libya and Iraq and a sharp fall in drilling in the Gulf of Mexico hurt margins. Baker Hughes said its clients would reconsider projects if oil prices fell to and remained at $75 per barrel for a few months. Ample supply and weak demand have hit oil prices in recent months. Global benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose to $84.49 a barrel on Thursday, after falling to $83 earlier, off nearly 28 percent from a June high. U.S. crude prices CLc1 also rose to $82.83 a barrel after falling to a two-year low of $80 a barrel.

The steep fall has sparked fears that oilfield earnings would be hurt with oil and gas customers reigning in spending. “The key to the overall oil market is still that the global oil demand is currently set to increase by 1.1 million barrels per day in 2015, which will require growth in exploration and production investments,” Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a post-earnings call on Friday. The International Energy Agency earlier this week cut its 2015 estimate for oil demand growth by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 1.1 million bpd, citing weak global economies. Oil demand was “largely unchanged”, while supply was relatively “well balanced,” Kibsgaard said on the call. “WTI oil at $80 a barrel for a short time is unlikely to have an impact on growth and margins for the services companies, but $80 oil for more than a month or two certainly will,” William Blair & Co analysts wrote in a note. They expect the company to “wait and see” how $80 WTI would impact producers’ spending plans. West Texas Intermediate crude was at about $83 per barrel on Friday, while Brent crude was over $87. Baker Hughes Inc, the world’s No.3 oilfield services provider, said on Thursday that drilling activity was unlikely to slow unless crude fell to and remained at $75 for a few months. Still, Schlumberger expects 2014 exploration spending to fall by 4-5 percent from a year ago, largely due to a 20 percent fall in seismic expenditure. Oil and gas companies are spending more on maximizing production from existing wells, than on searching for new reserves as they face increasing investor pressure to raise shareholder returns. Up to Thursday’s close, Schlumberger shares had fallen more than 20 percent over the last three months due to the sharp slide in crude prices.

164,SLB,Proposed merger of oilfield firms poses challenge to Schlumberger,"(Reuters) - The proposed merger of oilfield service companies Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc would create a serious challenger to Schlumberger NV in international markets and cement the two companies’ dominance in North America. And that is the problem, according to some analysts. “The proposed merger would be dominant in North America, which could spur protracted (antitrust) scrutiny; and likely elicit howls of protest from customers everywhere, potentially requiring concessions to more than one national anti-trust authority,” analysts at FBR Capital Markets wrote in a note. Baker Hughes disclosed after the market closed on Thursday that it was in preliminary merger talks with its Houston neighbor. But muted market reaction on Friday highlighted the likelihood that any deal would face an uphill regulatory battle. Baker Hughes’ shares were up 0.2 percent in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange while Halliburton’s were up 1.4 percent. Schlumberger’s stock was up 0.4 percent. A combined Halliburton-Baker Hughes would have combined revenue of about $52 billion, based on 2013 results, outstripping Schlumberger’s 2013 revenue of $45.3 billion. The merged company’s business in North America would also be about double that of Schlumberger, which gets more than two-thirds of its revenue from international operations. Still, the merged entity’s market value of about $70 billion would be far less than Schlumberger’s $120 billion. Baker Hughes, whose shares were trading at $58.38 at midday, should be able to command a 25 percent premium to its Wednesday close of $50.98 for an enterprise value of $25.46 billion, Evercore ISI analyst James West said in a note. The proposed deal would give Halliburton, the No. 2 oilfield services provider, the leading market share in oilfield services such as directional drilling, coiled tubing and drill-bits, unseating Schlumberger in all three markets, said West. A deal would not be all bad news for Schlumberger, however. Analysts said that by reducing the number of big players in  the industry to two from three, pricing could stabilize. “Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes have been in a knife fight the past few years for international and offshore tenders,” Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co analysts said. “A combined company could help introduce more discipline to these bid processes and ultimately improve returns/profits for the industry.”  ",11142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bakerhughes-halliburton-research/proposed-merger-of-oilfield-firms-poses-challenge-to-schlumberger-idUSKCN0IY24H20141114

Halliburton expressed confidence that the tie up of the No. 2 and No. 3 players in the services industry would clear regulatory hurdles, saying it was prepared to shed assets to mollify antitrust concerns that could arise in Asia, Europe and the Americas. The deal, the second biggest in the U.S. energy sector this year, could create a company with more revenue than  Schlumberger. (link.reuters.com/kav43w) With oil prices down by a third since June, demand for drilling services has slipped and stock prices across the energy sector have suffered. That has stoked chatter among executives and bankers about acquisition opportunities companies could take advantage of to weather the downturn. Halliburton Chief Executive Dave Lesar said the combined entity would be more resilient and able to offer a wider suite of products globally. “Stronger in any market condition is better,” he told Reuters. “We are in a cyclical business.” Halliburton said it was ready to divest businesses that generate revenue of $7.5 billion to satisfy regulators and would pay Baker Hughes $3.5 billion if the deal was not cleared. “At the end of the day, we wouldn’t have done this deal if we didn’t believe it was achievable from a regulatory standpoint,” Lesar said on a conference call. Baker Hughes shares were trading well below the offer, suggesting that investors were not so sure of regulatory approvals. But Kurt Hallead, oilfield services analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the risk of the deal failing was low. “I think the assessment on divestitures matches up pretty closely with the work we’ve done. I don’t anticipate there being any roadblocks,” he said. The transaction would unite the two companies based in Houston and create an entity dominant in U.S. onshore services such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. While there are at least seven major services where there is an overlap between the two companies, the deal would fill gaps in two product lines in Halliburton’s portfolio - product chemicals and pumps that boost output from wells. Baker Hughes shares rose nearly 11 percent to $66.44 each  on Monday, well short of Halliburton’s offer of $80.69, based on Friday’s close. After a steep run up last week, Halliburton shares were down 8 percent at $50.60. Schlumberger was up 0.6 percent at $95.85. Talks between the two companies started over a month ago and came to a head on Friday when Halliburton threatened to replace Baker Hughes’s board after its initial offer was rejected. Baker Hughes shareholders will get 1.12 Halliburton shares plus $19 in cash for every share held, and own 36 percent of the combined company. Baker Hughes will get three seats on the combined company’s 15-member board. The combined company’s 2013 revenue was $51.8 billion on a pro-forma basis, more than Schlumberger’s $45.3 billion.

168,SLB,UPDATE 1-Schlumberger to cut seismic fleet as spending falters,"(Adds details, share price) Dec 2 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd, the world’s No.1 oilfield services provider, said it was reducing the size of its marine seismic fleet to lower costs as it expects customers to cut exploration spending. Schlumberger said it would take a charge of $800 million to write down the value of six vessels and other WesternGeco assets in the fourth quarter ending December. (1.usa.gov/1yDRx6l) Oil and gas producers, Schlumberger’s customers, have scaled back spending plans due to a 40 percent fall in oil prices over the past six months. Analysts expect exploration spending, in particular, to be hit hard as oil and gas producers are unlikely to invest in new fields as long as prices remain low. Schlumberger’s fleet of vessels come with seismic equipment that help exploration companies survey potential oilfields. The company said on Tuesday it would reduce its fleet to nine survey and six source vessels by the end of the year, from 15 survey and eight source vessels at the end of 2013. Schlumberger said it plans to retire older vessels with lower towing capacity and higher operating costs, convert lower-end vessels to source boats, and cancel most of the leases on vessels it has hired. The company’s shares were up under 1 percent at $85.15 in afternoon trading. The stock has fallen 18 percent in the past six months as oil price fell.

Schlumberger had said last month that it would take a $1 billion charge related to jobs cuts and the writedown of some seismic vessels. “They did say they would be cutting jobs, but the magnitude of them is definitely a shocker,” Philip Van Deusen, an analyst with Tigress Financial Partners LLC, told Reuters.

176,SLB,Schlumberger: International markets to fare better than North America,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd, the world’s No.1 oilfield services provider, said the oil price drop was likely to have a “significantly more dramatic” impact on North America than on the rest of the world. Shares of Schlumberger, which derives two-thirds of its revenue from operations outside North America, rose as much as 5 percent to $80.79 on Friday. Brent crude prices have dropped nearly 60 percent over the last six months, prompting oil and gas companies to slash capital spending and pull back rigs. The impact on pricing and activity would, however, be less pronounced in international markets than onshore North America, Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a conference call on Friday, a day after the company said it would cut 9000 jobs in response to its customers’ spending cuts.. Rivals Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc, which are less exposed to international markets, are merging in a $35 billion deal that is expected to boost their North America business to double that of Schlumberger’s. Weak oil prices are widely expected to have a particularly severe impact on North America, where many shale fields are uneconomic at current oil prices of below $50 per barrel. Kibsgaard warned that with the U.S. land rig count down 400 rigs from October, activity reductions and pricing pressure would continue in the current quarter. Schlumberger, a technological leader in the industry, is counting on strength in Latin America and Middle East. Spending in Middle East is expected to rise 14.5 percent in 2015, according to Barclays estimates, while spending in North America is expected to fall at least 14.1 percent. Activity in Saudi Arabia had reached a “new record”, led by growth from a number of “key projects”, Schlumberger said. “Saudi Arabia is the lowest cost producer on the planet ... they’re probably the best positioned to withstand (the fall in oil prices)”, said Tigress Financial Partners analyst Philip Van Deusen. Schlumberger, which reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, is focusing on cutting costs by doubling asset utilization and increasing workforce productivity. The company’s operating margin was likely to drop 6 percent in the current downturn, compared with a 7.3 percent fall in the 2009 downturn, Morningstar analysts wrote in a note. Kibsgaard said margins would be better protected this time. “I will be very disappointed if we don’t do significantly better than in 2009.” ",1162015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-schlumberger-outlook/schlumberger-international-markets-to-fare-better-than-north-america-idUSKBN0KP1W820150116

U.S. consumer sentiment hit its highest in 11 years in January, while factory output rose last month, reports showed. Investors attempted to interpret the impact of the move by the Swiss National Bank on Thursday to lift the cap on the Swiss franc. The decision could be seen as foreshadowing a large stimulus move by the European Central Bank next week that would further weaken the euro, or as a safeguard against a possible Greek exit from the euro zone that could potentially destabilize the bloc. All 10 of the S&P; 500 sectors were higher, though energy   led the charge, rising 2.8 percent. U.S. crude oil futures settled up 5.3 percent after the International Energy Agency forecast the market downtrend would end. “Some of this is also just volatility, a little bit of a bounceback.

U.S. consumer sentiment hit its highest in 11 years in January, while factory output rose last month, reports showed. Investors attempted to interpret the impact of the move by the Swiss National Bank on Thursday to lift the cap on the Swiss franc. The decision could be seen as foreshadowing a large stimulus move by the European Central Bank next week that would further weaken the euro, or as a safeguard against a possible Greek exit from the euro zone that could potentially destabilize the bloc. All 10 of the S&P; 500 sectors were higher, though energy   led the charge, rising 2.6 percent. Oil prices gained after the International Energy Agency forecast the market downtrend would end. Still, analysts said strong gains were unlikely in the near term as global output outweighs demand. “Crude oil is up, it’s been up for a couple of days, any time that happens there is a belief we have put in a bottom,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.

179,SLB,UPDATE 1-Schlumberger: International markets to fare better than N.America,"(Adds details from conference call, analyst comment) By Swetha Gopinath and Narottam Medhora Jan 16 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd, the world’s No.1 oilfield services provider, said the oil price drop was likely to have a “significantly more dramatic” impact on North America than on the rest of the world. Shares of Schlumberger, which derives two-thirds of its revenue from operations outside North America, rose as much as 5 percent to $80.79 on Friday. Brent crude prices have dropped nearly 60 percent over the last six months, prompting oil and gas companies to slash capital spending and pull back rigs. The impact on pricing and activity would, however, be less pronounced in international markets than onshore North America, Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a conference call on Friday, a day after the company said it would cut 9000 jobs in response to its customers’ spending cuts.. Rivals Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc, which are less exposed to international markets, are merging in a $35 billion deal that is expected to boost their North America business to double that of Schlumberger’s. Weak oil prices are widely expected to have a particularly severe impact on North America, where many shale fields are uneconomic at current oil prices of below $50 per barrel. Kibsgaard warned that with the U.S. land rig count down 400 rigs from October, activity reductions and pricing pressure would continue in the current quarter. Schlumberger, a technological leader in the industry, is counting on strength in Latin America and Middle East. Spending in Middle East is expected to rise 14.5 percent in 2015, according to Barclays estimates, while spending in North America is expected to fall at least 14.1 percent. Activity in Saudi Arabia had reached a “new record”, led by growth from a number of “key projects”, Schlumberger said. “Saudi Arabia is the lowest cost producer on the planet ... they’re probably the best positioned to withstand (the fall in oil prices)”, said Tigress Financial Partners analyst Philip Van Deusen. Schlumberger, which reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, is focusing on cutting costs by doubling asset utilization and increasing workforce productivity. The company’s operating margin was likely to drop 6 percent in the current downturn, compared with a 7.3 percent fall in the 2009 downturn, Morningstar analysts wrote in a note. Kibsgaard said margins would be better protected this time. “I will be very disappointed if we don’t do significantly better than in 2009.”   (Editing by Savio D’Souza)",1162015,http://www.reuters.com/article/schlumberger-outlook/update-1-schlumberger-international-markets-to-fare-better-than-n-america-idUSL3N0UV4P120150116

Shares of Schlumberger, which gets only a third of its revenue from North America, were up more than 3.5 percent at $79.40 in morning trade on Friday. “In terms of the outlook for the international market ... we do expect a reduction in spend levels for all customer groups in the coming year, although we believe that the activity and pricing impact will be less than what is projected in North America land,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a conference call.

181,SLB,Schlumberger to buy $1.7 billion stake in Russian oil driller,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Oil services giant Schlumberger plans to buy a 45.65 percent stake in Eurasia Drilling for about $1.7 billion, potentially paving the way for it to become the sole owner of Russia’s most active oilfield services company. The deal offers the prospect of financial support for a Russian oil sector feeling the effects of Western sanctions over the situation in Ukraine, including a ban on global oil groups helping targeted companies to explore for Arctic, deep water or shale oil. Neither Eurasia nor its biggest shareholders Alexander Djaparidze, also the firm’s CEO, and Alexander Putilov are under sanctions.  The multi-stage deal announced by the companies on Tuesday will see U.S. group Schlumberger, which has been in a strategic alliance with Eurasia since 2011, offer $22 a share for the near-46 percent stake. Shares in Eurasia, formed about 10 years ago mostly from the drilling assets of Russia’s second-largest oil producer Lukoil, jumped 68 percent to $20.45 per global depositary receipt after Tuesday’s announcement.  The company, shares of which lost about 60 percent of their value last year in the face of the weakening Russian economy and increased competition from the likes of state oil producer Rosneft, intends to go private by delisting from the London stock market before the deal is completed.  The Schlumberger transaction and delisting are both expected to be completed in the first quarter, Eurasia said. In a separate statement, Schlumberger said it has an option to buy the remaining shares in Eurasia during a two-year period commencing three years from the closing of the initial transaction. A source close to the deal told Reuters that the transaction will not result in any violation of the sanctions imposed against Russia.  Russia is the world’s leading oil producer, with output hitting a post-Soviet high at an average of 10.58 million barrels per day last year, but the Western sanctions pose an increasing threat to this key source of the country’s revenue.  The oil services sector is ripe for consolidation as it grapples with reduced exploration investment in response to the painful 57 percent slump in global oil prices to around $49 since June and Schlumberger’s move would leave it well placed for any upturn in Russia. Along with Halliburton, Schlumberger is one of the largest foreign oilfield services companies operating in Russia. “Eurasia ... joining with Schlumberger ... establishes an exceptionally strong platform for delivering drilling services to Russia’s oil and gas industry as future market conditions stabilize,” said Roderick Peacock, chairman of Xenon Capital Partners, adviser to Eurasia Drilling’s core shareholders.

183,SLB,"Helmerich & Payne may cut 2,000 jobs as it idles rigs","(Reuters) - Driller Helmerich & Payne Inc (HP.N) said it may cut 2,000 jobs as it begins to idle rigs amid a slide in crude oil prices, following similar cost cuts by top oilfield services providers Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) and Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N. Helmerich, which had about 11,901 employees as of Sept. 30, also said it would now build only 2 high-tech FlexRigs per month this year, down from the 4 rigs it had planned. The company’s shares fell as much as 10 percent to $54 on Thursday as weak forecast for 2015 margins and revenue overshadowed a better-than-expected quarterly profit. The 2015 forecast “reflects a severe opening blow from the global downturn”, FBR Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note.   Helmerich has benefited so far from robust shale drilling activity in the United States. The gains extended into the first quarter Dec. 31, but are now eroding. Crude prices have slipped 60 percent since June due to oversupply, including from North American shale fields, and tepid demand growth. In response, oil producers are cutting budgets and slowing exploration activity, hurting Helmerich and other companies that provide rigs and services used in drilling. Helmerich said less than 200 rigs would be active by the end of the current quarter, down from over 297 in the first quarter.  “The rig count reduction thus far has been more swift than many expected,” Chief Executive John Lindsay said on a post-earnings call. Helmerich said it expects revenue and margins for U.S. land rigs to decrease in the second quarter. The company said it expected rig revenue in its U.S. land drilling unit to average $27,000-$27,500 per day in the second quarter, below the $29,457 it recorded in the first quarter. The company also said current-quarter revenue days would fall by about 25 percent from the first quarter. Helmerich said it expected revenue days to remain flat in its offshore rig business and fall about 10-15 percent in its international land rig unit.  Adjusted profit was $1.70 in the quarter ended Dec.31, above the average analyst estimate of $1.52.  Total operating revenue rose 18.8 percent to $1.06 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $977.3 million.

185,SLB,Many oil firms plan no North Dakota layoffs despite cheap oil,"WILLISTON, N.D., Feb 4 (Reuters) - Halliburton, Statoil ASA, Hess Corp and other North Dakota energy companies have decided, for now, not to lay off staff in the No. 2 U.S. oil producing state, hoping to be prepared for any prolonged rebound in crude prices. Many oil producers and their contractors are trying to strike a balance between cutting costs and maintaining workforce reserves after a more-than 50 percent drop in oil prices  since last June. The drop has made some oil patch investors anxious that North Dakota could experience a third oil bust after slumps in the 1950s and 1980s. Local business leaders, though, say they’re confident the state’s economy can abide the slowdown. Indeed, oil prices are nothing if not volatile, up about 19 percent in the past four trading days after plunging for months. Whiting Petroleum Corp, the largest North Dakota oil producer, has no plans to lay off any of its 507 employees in the state, spokesman Eric Hagen said. Oilfield service provider Halliburton has told its roughly 1,500 North Dakota employees that job cuts are not coming, for now. The update came in a letter to staff from Brent Eslinger, senior district manager for Halliburton in Williston, considered capital of North Dakota’s oil patch. Halliburton spokeswoman Susie McMichael added that the company “will continue to monitor the business environment” and cut costs as needed. Hess Corp, the state’s third-largest oil producer and one that uses Halliburton to hydraulically fracture wells, has no plans to cut North Dakota staff. “We’re all about lean efficiencies, but there are no plans for layoffs,” Hess spokesman John Roper said. Other large North Dakota producers, including Oasis Petroleum Inc and Statoil, have said they have no plans to reduce their workforce. EOG Resources Inc hasn’t “announced any layoffs,” spokeswoman K Leonard said. To be sure, all energy-related companies in North Dakota’s oil patch are hunkering down. Many of the state’s oil producers, including Hess and Oasis, have cut 2015 capital budgets. Whiting and EOG release spending plans later this month. While there are nearly 800 wells needing to be fracked in North Dakota, oil producers can wait up to a year to do so. Hess, for instance, plans to bring fewer wells online in 2015. Halliburton’s announcement last month that it will lay off 1,000 in the eastern hemisphere - as well as similar plans by peers Schlumberger NV and Baker Hughes Inc, which Halliburton is buying for roughly $35 billion - sparked concern that the companies would cull large portions of their North Dakota staffs, steps that would have a negative economic ripple effect. Such fears, for now, appear unwarranted. Continental Resources Inc, North Dakota’s second-largest oil producer, did not return a call seeking comment on staffing levels. Chief Executive Harold Hamm, though, bragged in a Tuesday press release that Continental’s North Dakota acreage continues “to provide exceptional results.”     (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Terry Wade and Andrew Hay)",2042015,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-north-dakota-oil/many-oil-firms-plan-no-north-dakota-layoffs-despite-cheap-oil-idUSL1N0VD24C20150204

Last month, Schlumberger said it planned to buy a 45.65 percent stake in Eurasia for about $1.7 billion, potentially paving the way for it to become the sole owner of Russia’s most active oilfield services company.

190,SLB,Factbox: U.S. energy companies slash jobs as oil prices weaken,"(Reuters) - Oilfield giants Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and many others in the oil and gas industry have announced plans to lay off thousands of people in the past few months as global oil prices have halved since June. In March, Brent prices LCoc1 fell to a near six-year low, hurt by a global supply glut and OPEC’s decision not to curtail production. This prompted oil producers to trim their budgets and lower the number of rigs planned for 2015, hurting their suppliers and service providers. Smaller oil services company Weatherford said last month it would eliminate the position of chief operating officer, while tiny oil and gas producer Resolute Energy Corp (REN.N) said it would slash its CEO’s base pay by 96 percent.   Oil major BP Plc (BP.L) said it would freeze its base pay across the company this year, while Basic Energy Services (BAS.N) said it has implemented salary cuts for all management and administrative employees and made changes to some benefit programs.

191,SLB,Schlumberger sees prudence as new normal for U.S. shale oil,"(Reuters) - The U.S. shale oil industry may have forever abandoned its heavy-spending ways in the face of sliding crude prices, Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world’s No.1 oilfield services provider, said on Monday. Spending cuts already announced by producers - to the tune of 25 to 60 percent - have dropped the rig count by 45 percent since late 2014, and output will soon decline or flatten out so prices can recover, Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said.  U.S. oil prices CLc1 have fallen by 50 percent since June to below $50 per barrel as growing supplies of tight oil from shale and oil sands in North America overwhelm weak global demand. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has refrained from cutting output to lift prices, a move Kibsgaard said may be part of an effort to test the resilience of higher cost producers. At the time of $100 oil, some highly-leveraged U.S. players were known for their intensive capex budgets. That has changed. “Going forward, we believe financial prudence, where investments are limited to the cash flow generated by production, will be the new normal for U.S. tight-oil developments,” he said at the Scotia Howard Weil Energy conference in New Orleans. Outside of North America, Schlumberger expects the oil and gas industry’s international spending on exploration and production to drop by 10 to 15 percent in 2015, continuing a trend seen last year. He said this is related to a “sharp reduction” in deepwater exploration activity that could delay the sanctioning of new developments, adding that the company is seeing lower activity and pricing pressure in the Gulf of Mexico.  That means, he said, “the global oil market is clearly heading for a tightening ... in the second half of this year.” The rebalancing would come in part from less supply but also stronger demand in a market currently oversupplied by about 1 million barrels per day. Schlumberger, which has seen its share price fall by about a third since July, would be positioned to take advantage of any uptick in demand for its range of oilfield services, from drilling to fracking, Kibsgaard said. He emphasized that Schlumberger has been generating more free cashflow than its two main competitors, Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N, which are in the process of merging. But he also acknowledged that the industry is going through a rocky downturn. “In the short term, activity visibility still remains limited as many of our customers are making drastic and sometimes unpredictable cuts to protect margins and cash flow,” he said.

Adams NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures settled more than 1 percent higher on Monday, boosted by a falling dollar that outweighed pressure on prices from a global supply glut. “The dollar is under pressure, and we saw buyers coming into the market as a result,” said Tradition Energy senior analyst Gene McGillian. U.S. crude futures settled 88 cents up at $47.45 on Monday, a 1.9 percent climb. The price of Brent rose more than 1 percent to settle up 60 cents at $55.92 per barrel. Oil got a boost as the U.S. dollar fell further, adding to its steepest weekly drop in 3-1/2 years. Market watchers have been unwinding long dollar positions since the Federal Reserve indicated last week that a U.S. interest rate hike is likely to come later rather than sooner. Oil prices were pressured as Saudi Arabia has stood firm on its decision to maintain production levels, saying it would consider cutting output only if producers outside OPEC also did so. Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the kingdom was now pumping about 10 million barrels per day, which could indicate an increase of 350,000 bpd over its February production. Barclays analysts forecast on Monday that if OPEC production holds near current levels of almost 30 million bpd, the market surplus would expand from 900,000 bpd to 1.3 million bpd.

China boosted overall imports late last year, taking advantage of cheap oil to build its reserves, but storage tanks could be reaching their limits, forcing a slowdown in orders.

Last month, Schlumberger said it planned to buy a 45.65 percent stake in Eurasia for about $1.7 billion, potentially paving the way for it to become the sole owner of Russia’s most active oilfield services company. Artemyev said Russian officials would meet Schlumberger during the next 10 days to discuss conditions for the deal’s approval. These included “entirely standard conditions - the defence of state secrets”, he said. Russia is also concerned about complications that could arise from potential international sanctions impeding the activity of investors operating in Russia, Artemyev said. He said that one of Russia’s likely demands, if sanctions were imposed which prevented the company operating, would be that Schlumberger would have to sell the stake in Eurasia Drilling to a Russian investor.

208,SLB,"U.S. oil drilling faces slow recovery, no new highs -Schlumberger","NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - An eventual recovery in U.S. oil drilling activity after the biggest slump in three decades may never reach last year’s frenzied pace, according to the world’s largest oilfield services company. The drilling recovery will likely to be slower to emerge due to a growing reserve of wells that have been drilled but not yet hydraulically fractured and increased activity in re-fracking wells that are running dry, Schlumberger Ltd Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said in a conference call Friday. Schlumberger expects the rebound in U.S. onshore drilling “will be pushed out in time as the inventory of uncompleted wells drilled and the refracturing market expand,” Kibsgaard told analysts following the announcement of the company’s earnings. The recovery “will fall well short of reaching previous levels.” The message suggests that the disconnect between rigs drilling for oil and the trajectory of U.S. production may get worse before it gets better. While U.S. output rose in tandem with the number of rigs in the early years of the shale boom, output has continued climbing even as the rig count collapses to less than half its October peak. The decline in oil rigs slowed this week but left their number at the lowest since 2010, Baker Hughes Inc, another oil services firm, said separately on Friday. Now, fracking a backlog of wells and reviving existing ones could mean that oil production begins to recover even as the number of rigs drilling new wells remains depressed. “There were a number of people still out there who were still expecting a v-shaped recovery,” said James Wicklund, managing director of equity research at Credit Suisse. The recovery will instead be shaped like a bathtub, scraping along the bottom, with drilling levels remaining depressed for the coming four to five years, he said. In part, the return to drilling will lag because producers will begin to frack drilled uncompleted wells - wells that have been opened up, but have not yet had the oil extracted from them. “At least 2,700 wells have been identified as candidates for refracture in North America,” said James West, an analyst at EvercoreISI. The Eagle Ford likely contains 1,000 of these wells, known as DUCs, according to West’s estimate, while the Bakken has about 500, and the Marcellus, Niobrara, and Haynesville each contain over 300 candidates. The market value of these opportunities together is about $5 billion, he said.

209,SLB,"UPDATE 1-Schlumberger impresses with cost cuts, resilient margins","(Adds background, CEO quotes) By Swetha Gopinath and Sayantani Ghosh April 17 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd, the world’s No.1 oilfield services provider, reported a smaller-than-expected fall in first-quarter margins as it continued to execute tight cost controls to combat a decline in drilling activity. Schlumberger shares rose as much as 3.3 percent to a near-five-month high of $94.89 on Friday, a day after the company reported a profit well ahead of analysts’ expectations despite a 9 percent drop in quarterly revenue. “Market pricing for certain products and services (in North America) has already reached unsustainable levels,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a conference call with analysts on Friday. “However, we are being selective in the pursuit of market share and very disciplined in the avoidance of loss-making contracts.” Resilience in its international business, which accounts for more than two-thirds of Schlumberger’s total revenue, helped drive profit. “I think the overall resilience in our well-balanced international business is underestimated,” Kibsgaard said. Schlumberger’s cost of revenue fell 7 percent in the quarter ended Mar. 31. Operating margins shrunk to 17.6 percent from 19.3 percent a year earlier, but were higher than the estimates of some analysts tracked by Reuters. Evercore ISI analysts, who had predicted margins of 14.5 percent, said the company had “exceeded our expectations in its ability to swiftly reduce its cost structure to correspond to industry realities.” “Schlumberger was likely the most proactive company in the group preparing for the downturn, swiftly adjusting to changing market conditions,” they said. The Houston-based company plans to cut 11,000 jobs, bringing the total job cuts announced this year to 20,000 - about 15 percent of its workforce. A 44 percent slide in crude prices since June has also prompted nearly 13,000 job cuts at rivals Halliburton Co  and Baker Hughes Inc, who are set to merge in a $35 billion deal. Kibsgaard said he expects a recovery in U.S. land drilling activity to be delayed as energy companies on stringent budgets deploy fewer rigs, forcing services firms to continue discounting. “We don’t expect that rig counts are going to come back to the previous levels of around 2,000. It’s going to come back somewhere in between the current levels and where it was.” There were 760 rigs drilling for oil in the United States as of April 10, according to Baker Hughes’ closely watched survey.

210,SLB,UPDATE 1-QUOTEBOX-Schlumberger CEO on the effects of low oil prices,"(Adds CEO comment on OPEC) April 17 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd, the world’s No. 1 oilfield services provider, said it would cut a further 11,000 jobs and had reduced its capital spending plan for the year in anticipation of an extended lull in activity and slump in pricing. The company’s first-quarter profit beat the average analyst estimate after it exercised strict cost controls. Schlumberger executives spoke to analysts on a conference call on Friday, a day after the company reported. Here is a selection of comments from Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard: “The pace and magnitude of the activity reductions, particularly in North America, has been almost unprecedented and we have to go back to the mid-1980s to find anything similar.” “In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, deepwater activity was resilient in the first quarter, although we’re seeing a steady change in service mix from exploration towards development work, driven by budget cuts from most of our customers.” “Market pricing for certain products and services (in North America) has already reached unsustainable levels. However, we’re being selective in the pursuit of market share and very disciplined in the avoidance of loss-making contracts.” “In terms of managing the pricing pressure, we remain fully focused on navigating the commercial landscape by carefully balancing the pursuit of market share with the protection of operating margins and by always aiming to trade any pricing concessions for additional work scope or better contract terms.” “Looking at the industry as a whole, the current financial challenges will not disappear, even if oil prices were to recover to the levels seen in recent years. The industry is therefore forced to seek new ways of working together to reduce costs and create more project value.” “We expect the largest E&P; (exploration and production) investments to occur in North America, where 2015 spend is expected to be down by more than 30 percent. We further believe our recovery in U.S. land drilling activity will be pushed out in time as the inventory of uncompleted wells drilled and the refracturing market expand. We also anticipate our recovery in North America land activity will fall well short of reaching previous levels.” “In the international market, we expect 2015 E&P; spend to fall around 16 percent, which will create challenges in terms of activity and pricing levels, but considerably less than the headwinds seen in North America.” “I’d say there are thousands of wells in North America land that are candidates for refracturing and this is both shale liquids and shale gas.” “... The pricing concessions that are currently being given, we unfortunately are going to have to live with for a while, because it’s going to be a pretty significant overcapacity for all sorts of services given the lower activity level ...” “There is a weakness in the non-NAM (North America), non-OPEC supply base. It was basically flat Q1 year-over-year, but given the reductions we’re seeing in spend and the weakness in several of the key basins, we expect that weakness to continue and potentially increase as the year progresses, and I think that’s why we believe that there will be some recovery in Brent. “The question is to what extent OPEC wants or is willing to put more balance on the market to stabilize prices at some level below $100.”   (Reporting by Anet Josline Pinto and Swetha Gopinath in Bengaluru)",4172015,http://www.reuters.com/article/schlumberger-nv-costs-ceo/update-1-quotebox-schlumberger-ceo-on-the-effects-of-low-oil-prices-idUSL4N0XE4EL20150417
211,SLB,Schlumberger shares rise as cost cuts impress,"April 17 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd’s shares rose as much as 3.3 percent on Friday, after tight cost controls helped the world’s No.1 oilfield services provider report higher-than-expected margins in the first quarter. While Schlumberger said on Thursday that lower activity and pricing pressure led to a 9 percent drop in quarterly revenue, profits came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. “Market pricing for certain products and services (in North America) has already reached unsustainable levels,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a conference call with analysts on Friday. “However, we are being selective in the pursuit of market share and very disciplined in the avoidance of loss-making contracts.” Schlumberger shares were up 2.4 percent at $94.08 on the New York Stock Exchange in early trading, after touching a near-five-month high of $94.89. The company now plans to cut 11,000 jobs, bringing the total job cuts announced this year to 20,000 - about 15 percent of its workforce. A 44 percent slide in crude prices since June has also prompted nearly 13,000 job cuts at rivals Halliburton Co  and Baker Hughes Inc, who are set to merge in a $35 billion deal. Schlumberger’s cost of revenue fell 7 percent in the quarter ended Mar. 31. Operating margins shrunk to 17.6 percent from 19.3 percent a year earlier, but were higher than the estimates of some analysts tracked by Reuters. Evercore ISI analysts, who had predicted margins of 14.5 percent, said the company had “exceeded our expectations in its ability to swiftly reduce its cost structure to correspond to industry realities.” “Schlumberger was likely the most proactive company in the group preparing for the downturn, swiftly adjusting to changing market conditions,” they said.

213,SLB,Lower cost cuts at Halliburton may give Schlumberger near-term edge,"(Reuters) - Halliburton Co’s decision to cut fewer jobs and keep its logistics network intact to capitalize on its pending merger with Baker Hughes Inc could give Schlumberger NV an edge at a time when cost cuts look like the best way forward. Halliburton is sticking to an “elevated cost structure” as it bets on its capacity to take on more work as a bigger company once the $35 billion deal closes, a move that could cost the company a 2-3 percent decline in near-time margins. But work itself is scarce, with oil producers doubling down for a long downturn in the North American shale industry, which has been crippled due to a slump in global oil prices. Schlumberger, the world’s No.1 oilfield services provider, recently wooed shareholders with 11,000 job cuts, in addition to the 9,000 announced earlier. In comparison, Halliburton has cut 9,000 jobs. “I think in the very near term, Schlumberger is going to make more money than Halliburton because it’s not carrying the extra cost,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Boyd. Moreover, higher costs will hinder Halliburton’s ability to take on Schlumberger in international markets, which have been more resilient to the drop in crude prices. “By leveraging both its technological and cost advantages, I think Schlumberger has the opportunity to take share in areas that are not a primary focus for Halliburton and Baker Hughes,” said Tigress Financial Partners analyst Philip Van Deusen. But both Boyd and Deusen said Halliburton stands to gain in the longer term because of the deal due to benefits from synergies. Halliburton has said it expects the Baker Hughes deal to result in annual costs savings of about $2 billion. “... in a typical downturn we would have reduced our operating cost structure more than we have done ...,” Halliburton Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Miller said on a post-earnings call on Monday. “While this decision burdens current margins, it is clearly the right thing to do in the long run.” Halliburton’s margins in the January-March quarter slid more than 11 percentage points from the October-December period, according to Barclays, while Schlumberger’s margins fell by 6.7 percentage points. “Schlumberger’s margins in North America will likely be higher than Halliburton’s during the downturn,” said Evercore ISI analyst James West.

215,SLB,WRAPUP 2-Weak U.S. business spending data hints at sluggish growth rebound,"(Adds details, analyst comments, updates markets) * Core capital goods orders fall 0.5 percent in March * Core capital goods shipments slip 0.4 percent * Durable goods orders jump 4.0 percent on transportation By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON, April 24 (Reuters) - U.S. business investment spending plans fell for a seventh straight month in March, weighed down by a strong dollar and lower energy prices, suggesting the economy was struggling to rebound from a recent soft patch. The report from the Commerce Department on Friday came on the heels of lukewarm data on retail sales, employment and housing starts that have hinted at insufficient growth momentum that could prompt the Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates until later this year. “This is consistent with a sluggish rebound in growth. It’s shedding more doubt on the Fed’s willingness to raise rates mid-year,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York. Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, declined 0.5 percent last month after a revised 2.2 percent drop in February, which was the biggest decline since July 2013. The so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have declined 1.1 percent in February. Economists had forecast these orders gaining 0.3 percent last month. The weakness mirrors other manufacturing indicators such as industrial production and various regional factory surveys. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies after the report, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. U.S. stocks were trading marginally higher as investors were cheered by strong results from Google Inc, Amazon.com Inc  and Microsoft Corp. The Fed has kept overnight interest rates near zero since December 2008, but a number of officials have said an increase will likely be considered at its June policy-setting meeting. Manufacturing has been undermined by the buoyant dollar, whose 12.1 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States’ main trading partners since last June has eroded overseas profits of multinational companies like Procter & Gamble Co. The world’s largest household products maker on Thursday reported a 8.3 percent decline in quarterly sales. In addition, lower energy prices have cut into domestic oil production, reducing demand for equipment by oil-field companies, including Schlumberger and Halliburton . Schlumberger, the world’s No.1 oil-field services provider, has cut its capital expenditure plans for this year by about $500 million to $2.5 billion. Halliburton slashed its capex by about 15 percent to $2.8 billion. “Cheap oil and a strong dollar, while beneficial to consumers, are putting serious pressure on manufacturers,” said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York. The dollar and reduced capex spending by oil-field firms combined with a harsh winter and softer global demand to slow U.S. growth at the start of the year. In March, shipments of core capital goods - which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government’s gross domestic product measurement - fell 0.4 percent after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in February. Shipments in February were previously reported to have risen 0.3 percent. As a result, JPMorgan lowered its first-quarter GDP growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 0.6 percent annual pace. Barclays trimmed its forecast to a 1.1 percent rate from a 1.2 percent pace. The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The government will publish its snapshot of first-quarter GDP next Wednesday. Pointing to prolonged weakness in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, unfilled orders for core capital goods fell for a second straight month in March after barely rising in January. “We have not seen the full ramifications of the strong dollar and the drop in oil-related investment, so that could continue to play out,” said Thomas Costerg, a U.S. economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. “The focus is now on services and consumers in the hope that they are going to pick up the tab. So far we are not seeing signs of that.” A surge in transportation equipment buoyed overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - which rebounded 4.0 percent last month. That was the largest increase since July last year and followed a 1.4 percent decline in February.

It said both companies were continuing to cooperate with the Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) and the Commission on Foreign Investment on the proposed merger. Last month, Schlumberger said it planned to buy a 45.65 percent stake in Eurasia for about $1.7 billion, potentially paving the way for it to become the sole owner of Russia’s most active oilfield services company. Russian authorities have been concerned about complications that could arise from future international sanctions impeding the activity of investors operating in Russia. The deal requires approval from the governmental commission. Eurasia Drilling and FAS declined immediate comment. Eurasia, whose shares lost about 60 percent of their value last year because of the weakening Russian economy and increased competition from state oil producer Rosneft, intends to go private by delisting from the London Stock Exchange before the deal is completed.

223,SLB,Schlumberger profit beats estimates as cost cuts pay off,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world’s No.1 oilfield services provider, reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit as its cost-cutting efforts helped soften the impact of reduced global drilling activity. Schlumberger, which provides drilling technology and equipment to oil and gas companies, now expects exploration and production investment in North America to fall by more than 35 percent. The company in April forecast North American E&P; spending to drop more than 30 percent. “We believe that the North American rig count may now be touching the bottom, and that a slow increase in both land drilling and completion activity could occur in the second half of the year,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said in a statement. According to weekly data published by Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N last week, U.S. energy firms added five oil rigs, the second straight week of increases and a sign drillers were ready to return to the well pad. “We do see some activity improvement (in North America) although we do think that activity improvement will be limited,” Evercore ISI analyst James West said. “I think if we saw oil prices at $65-$70 per barrel brent, then we would see some type of improvement in activity particularly in North America and likely some stabilization in the international markets, which should lead to an improvement in activity next year,” West said. Brent oil LCOc1 closed at $57.50 per barrel on Thursday. Schlumberger, which is less exposed to North America than rivals Baker Hughes and Halliburton Co (HAL.N), said revenue from the region fell nearly 39 percent in the second quarter.

226,SLB,Schlumberger betting on slight recovery in North America demand,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger NV is betting on an uptick in demand for oilfield services in North America, a market that has been battered by a steep drop in oil prices. The world’s No.1 oilfield services company would carry “slightly more” costs in the current quarter to “be ready for growth in activity”, CEO Paal Kibsgaard said on a post-earnings call on Friday. “We believe we are getting close to bottom,” he said, but warned he couldn’t be a “100 percent certain” of higher activity in the fourth quarter, or even the first quarter of 2016. Swift cost cuts have helped Schlumberger offset revenue declines caused by a 50 percent fall in global crude prices since June 2014. The cuts helped the company report a better-than-expected second-quarter profit on Thursday. “(The cost cuts give) them a little room to play the ‘wait-and-see’ game to see if these North American markets actually can gather some steam,” said Tigress Financial Partners analyst Philip Van Deusen. Schlumberger said it expects a “slow increase” in land drilling and completion activity in North America in the second half of the year, but it does not expect pricing to pick up any time soon. The company has cut 20,000 jobs, or 15 percent of its workforce this year. Schlumberger said on Friday it did not plan to lay off more people. “If they didn’t think that there would be some recovery, they probably would let some people go,” said Griffin Securities analyst Kevin Simpson. However, analysts warned that higher labor and other costs would eat into third-quarter margins. “If the rebound doesn’t come as expected, that naturally would lead to an eroding of bottom line for SLB,” said Raymond James analyst Praveen Narra. Evercore ISI analyst James West said he expects margins in North America to fall by 22.5 percent in the third quarter, steeper than the 20 percent fall recorded in the second quarter ended June 30. Job cuts, combined with new technology sales and efficient supply chain management, have helped Schlumberger fare better in the latest oil price downturn than in the 2009 oil shock, analysts said. Schlumberger’s North American margins fell 37 percent in the first half of the year, compared with as much as 72 percent in the first half of 2009. International margins have slipped about 18 percent so far this year, compared with a 73 percent slump in the first half of 2009.

228,SLB,UPDATE 1-QUOTEBOX-Schlumberger CEO: pricing weak for rest of the year,"(Adds comments on Halliburton and Baker Hughes merger) July 17 (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd, the world’s No. 1 oilfield services provider, expects little improvement in pricing levels in the near future as customers continue to keep a tight lid on budgets, it said on a conference call on Friday. The company on Thursday reported a quarterly profit well ahead of expectations as it managed to cut cost of revenue by more than a fifth, softening  the impact of reduced global drilling activity. Schlumberger, which provides drilling technology and equipment to oil and gas companies, expects exploration and production investment in North America to fall by more than 35 percent versus its forecast, in April, of a 30 percent drop. Here is a selection of comments from chief executive Paal Kibsgaard from Friday’s conference call: “The dramatic reduction in activity in US land has created a massive capacity oversupply in the service industry with pricing quickly plummeting to unsustainable levels, in particular for pressure pumping.” “There’s going to be a further impact of pricing in the second half of the year. We haven’t seen the full impact of that.” “There will be little to no improvement in pricing levels in North America and hence the market will still remain very challenging for the foreseeable future.” “On the supply side of the oil market, the global market share battle between OPEC and the high cost producers is still playing out with the first signs of flattening North America production starting to show.” “We do expect that any improvement in oil prices in the second half of the year will potentially lead to increased investment levels in 2016, both for exploration and development related activity.” “We are prepared to carry slightly more cost into Q3 and this is not a significant part. Now, I can’t say 100 percent certain that (growth is) going to come in Q4 or Q1, but what we’re saying is that we believe we are getting close to bottom.” On offshore projects: “Going forward in terms of sanctioning new projects, I think it’s going to be very important for the industry to be able to ... come up with technical solutions and field development plans that significantly reduces cost per barrel.” “We have fully exited Iran. When the sanctions are lifted and when it is permissible, we will evaluate going back in.” On Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc  merger: “It’s a bit difficult for me to say what the impact is. That’s more of a customer question, right? It obviously creates a bit of uncertainty from our customers, firstly, is the transaction going to go through?” “I think it creates uncertainty from the customer side as to how they go about awarding in tender situation and it has probably also led to potentially slightly lower rate of tendering in this part of the cycle.”   (Reporting by Swetha Gopinath, Kanika Sikka, Amrutha Gayathri and Anet Josline Pinto in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh)",7172015,http://www.reuters.com/article/schlumberger-nv-pricing-ceo/update-1-quotebox-schlumberger-ceo-pricing-weak-for-rest-of-the-year-idUSL4N0ZX4AO20150717

230,SLB,Schlumberger says evaluating Iran return after sanctions end,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger NV, the world’s No.1 oilfield services provider, said it would look at returning to Iran once the sanctions are lifted. “When the sanctions are lifted and when it is permissible, we will evaluate going back in,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a post-earnings call. Iran’s agreement with major world powers to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some sanctions could open up the world’s fourth-largest oil reserves and second-largest natural gas reserves to multi-national oil companies. However, not all sanctions would be lifted and those that are removed can be rapidly restored if the deal falters. Schlumberger agreed in March to pay a $237.2 million fine after pleading guilty to violating U.S. sanctions on Iran and Sudan. The company ceased operations in Iran in the second quarter of 2013, four years after deciding to stop bidding for new Iranian oilfield work. However, some non-U.S. affiliates of the company continued to work for the National Iranian Oil Co or its units. Revenue from the work totaled $418 million in 2012, accounting for about 4 percent of total revenue that year. Schlumberger reported a better-than-expected profit on Thursday as stringent costs controls helped offset revenue declines caused by a steep fall in oil prices. The company’s shares were little changed at $84.95 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

232,SLB,UPDATE 2-US antitrust worries weigh on Halliburton-Baker Hughes deal -source,"(Recasts with Reuters sourcing; adds details on antitrust concerns; updates share prices) July 22 (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Halliburton Co’s acquisition of smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc  faces concerns from U.S. antitrust enforcers who believe the $35 billion merger will lead to higher prices and less innovation, according to a source close to the probe. A second source, who is also close to the probe, said the investigation into the proposed tie-up of the No. 2 and No. 3 oilfield services companies was far from complete and could well end with targeted divestitures to resolve the Justice Department’s concerns. The combined company would overtake Schlumberger NV  as the No. 1 oilfield services provider. The Justice Department concern was first reported by Bloomberg. (bloom.bg/1HRYqUb) Share prices of both companies dropped on the report. Halliburton spokeswoman Susie McMichael said in an email to Reuters that the company was fully committed to its target of closing the acquisition in late 2015. Baker Hughes declined to comment. Halliburton has said it was willing to sell three drilling businesses to satisfy anticipated Justice Department concerns. Halliburton said on Monday that it was “pleased with the prices and level of interest” it had received. The second source called the potential purchasers “impressive.” The Justice Department concern focused on two areas, according to the first source. One is that the drilling technology businesses would go to small companies that could not effectively compete with the two leaders. The other is that the leaders would have less incentive to innovate. Halliburton and Baker Hughes have overlapping businesses in the United States, Asia and Europe, and the deal is being scrutinized by regulators in several countries. The second source, who believes regulators will ultimately approve the deal, said the companies knew going into the antitrust probe that divestitures would be needed, and that these were under discussion. The Justice Department has not said if it was satisfied, said the source, who noted that the agency was far from ready to make a final decision. The source also said it would be unusual for the department to sue because of an expected loss in innovation. Halliburton has said it was confident of achieving cost synergies of nearly $2 billion from the Baker Hughes deal. Shares of Baker Hughes closed down 3.9 percent at $58.28 while Halliburton finished down 0.8 percent at $41.54.

233,SLB,European regulators ask Halliburton for more merger information-company,"NEW YORK, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Halliburton Co announced in a statement on Sunday it had received a request from the European Commission for additional information about its proposed $35 billion merger with rival Baker Hughes Inc. The company also said it had responded to a second request made by U.S. antitrust officials considering whether to approve the merger. According to the statement, the European Commission on Friday asked for more information about the merger “in a few discrete areas.” The statement did not offer specifics about the European regulators’ request. Sources told Reuters on July 22 U.S. Justice Department officials were concerned the merger could stifle innovation and drive up prices in the industry. Halliburton’s statement said the European regulators’ request came as a response to a standard notification form it filed with the commission on July 23. “Both Halliburton and Baker Hughes continue to work constructively with the DOJ on the investigation,” the statement said. “Halliburton is fully committed to a target of closing the acquisition in late 2015, though the acquisition agreement provides that the closing can be extended into 2016, if necessary.” The combined company would overtake Schlumberger NV  as the No. 1 oilfield services provider.

235,SLB,"‘Frack now, pay later,’ top services companies say amid oil crash","HOUSTON (Reuters) - Business is so tough for oilfield giants Schlumberger NV and Halliburton Co that they have come up with a new sales pitch for crude producers halting work in the worst downturn in years. It amounts to this: “frack now and pay later.” The moves by the world’s No. 1 and No. 2 oil services companies show how they are scrambling to book sales of new technologies to customers short of cash after a 60 percent slide in crude to $45 a barrel. In some cases, they are willing to take on the role of traditional lenders, like banks, which have grown reluctant to lend since the price drop that began last summer, or act like producers by taking what are essentially stakes in wells. At Halliburton, some of the capital to finance the sales will come from $500 million in backing from asset manager BlackRock, part of a wave of alternative finance pouring into the energy industry that one Houston lawyer said on Thursday allows companies to “keep the engine running.” When its second-quarter net profit tumbled by more than half a billion dollars to just $54 million, Halliburton’s Chief Executive Dave Lesar told analysts the company needed to find new revenue. The BlackRock money, he said, would allow Halliburton to “look at additional ways of doing business with our customers, different business models, push beyond where we have been today.” Halliburton declined to provide additional details, including how many customers it has for its financing program, citing confidential dealings with clients. Schlumberger has said it has eight onshore refracking clients in North America. Another variant, which Halliburton has considered and Schlumberger has pushed, is one in which the companies cover up-front costs for a producer and then get a piece of a well’s performance. The services companies have made these special offers to producers in a bid to roll out the new business line of refracking, in which existing wells are worked over to lift output. Halliburton and Schlumberger tout refracking as a cheap way of adding barrels because it avoids drilling new wells, which can cost several million dollars each. One way to refrack involves injecting tiny rubber-coated balls and reactive fluids that can later dissolve in a well to seal off existing fissures in rock. This boosts pressure. Then, new cracks in rock that release oil are created with a pressurized frack slurry of sand, water and chemicals. It is not yet clear how much business refracking will generate. Oilfield services analyst Angie Sedita at the Swiss bank UBS said in a note to clients that refracking will “not be enough of a demand driver” in 2016 and will take time to make inroads. Two prominent shale producers, EOG Resources Inc and Anadarko Petroleum Corp, have both said refracking technology needs improvement. Others, including Chesapeake Energy Corp and Devon Energy Corp have said they have been refracking and are happy with the results. Devon said this week it has refracked 1,000 wells over the years in North Texas and indicated it has no plans to tap unusual financing from a service company. A few dozen wells have been refracked twice and the company said it is working on newer generation refracking methods for its large inventory of wells. “We’ve got a great opportunity there and we’re continuing to prosecute that on our own,” Tony Vaughn, Devon’s executive vice president for exploration and production said on Wednesday. Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard has acknowledged producers might be unwilling to give up output from a well they think will be lucrative, and instead choose a traditional services contract. “It’s just a reflection of do they want to capture more of the value themselves or would they like to outsource all the risk and potentially much more of the upside to us?,” he said on the company’s July results call.

238,SLB,Schlumberger to buy oilfield gear maker Cameron in $14.8 billion deal,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) will buy equipment maker Cameron International Corp CAM.N for $14.8 billion, as the world’s top oilfield services firm scrambles to offer a broader range of products at lower prices to oil companies slashing budgets. The deal, which values Cameron around the market cap it had when oil prices were still $100 a barrel, marks the second big merger among energy services companies since crude prices LCOc1 entered a 60 percent slide last year. Halliburton and Baker Hughes, Schlumberger’s rivals, agreed to a $35 billion tie-up in November. Schlumberger said the acquisition will allow it to bundle its offerings, which range from surveying a site to drilling wells, with ones from Cameron that include pressure valves and blowout preventers, one of which was at BP’s Macondo well that exploded in 2010. The two companies know each other well. They set up a joint venture, OneSubsea, to target the deepwater industry in 2012. They have been eyeing each other since then, a person familiar with the deal told Reuters who spoke on the condition of anonymity, noting that Schlumberger has a history of acquiring its partners. “The deal should allow a more complete solution to customers and should allow SLB to grow market share,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Boyd. “Smaller companies offering discrete products and services will likely be at a disadvantage going forward.” Schlumberger said the combined company would have pro-forma revenue of $59 billion in 2014. That is 20 percent more than Schlumberger’s revenue for 2014 and compares with $57.42 billion generated together by Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N. The Halliburton and Baker Hughes deal is yet to close as U.S. antitrust enforcers believe the $35 billion merger will lead to higher prices and less innovation, according to a Reuters source. Billions in divestitures are planned in the hope of winning clearance. Schlumberger, in comparison, said it expects no antitrust hurdles and has no plans to divest any part of Cameron’s portfolio to get regulatory approval. An anti-trust lawyer described the product lines as complementary. “With SLB-CAM, there is not much in the way of overlapping businesses ... we do not envision an overly difficult antitrust review,” Oppenheimer analyst James Schumm said. Cameron’s shares were up about 41 percent at $60, below Schlumberger’s $66.36 per share cash-and-stock offer, in afternoon trading on Wednesday. Schlumberger’s shares fell as much as 7.5 percent to $68.01, their lowest in two-and-a-half years. The Macondo well explosion in April 2010 killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Investigators found Cameron’s blowout preventer had battery and wiring troubles that hindered the proper functioning of the devices’ blind shear rams, which are designed to slice through drilling pipes and cap a well in an emergency. Cameron agreed to a $250 million settlement with BP PLC (BP.L) to help pay for costs associated with the spill. Schlumberger’s offer on Wednesday values Cameron at $12.74 billion, based on the company’s diluted shares as of June 30. Cameron shareholders will get $14.44 in cash and 0.716 of a Schlumberger share for each share held. Schlumberger said it expects the deal to add to earnings by the end of the first year after the deal closes. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. Goldman Sachs & Co is Schlumberger’s financial adviser and Baker Botts LLP and Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP are its legal counsel.

Schlumberger said the acquisition will allow it to bundle its offerings, which range from surveying a site to drilling wells, with ones from Cameron that include pressure valves and blowout preventers, one of which was at BP’s Macondo well that exploded in 2010. The two companies know each other well. They set up a joint venture, OneSubsea, to target the deepwater industry in 2012. They have been eyeing each other since then, a person familiar with the deal told Reuters who spoke on the condition of anonymity, noting that Schlumberger has a history of acquiring its partners. “The deal should allow a more complete solution to customers and should allow SLB to grow market share,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Boyd. “Smaller companies offering discrete products and services will likely be at a disadvantage going forward.” Schlumberger said the combined company would have pro-forma revenue of $59 billion in 2014. That is 20 percent more than Schlumberger’s revenue for 2014 and compares with $57.42 billion generated together by Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc. The Halliburton and Baker Hughes deal is yet to close as U.S. antitrust enforcers believe the $35 billion merger will lead to higher prices and less innovation, according to a Reuters source. Billions in divestitures are planned in the hope of winning clearance. Schlumberger, in comparison, said it expects no antitrust hurdles and has no plans to divest any part of Cameron’s portfolio to get regulatory approval. An anti-trust lawyer described the product lines as complementary. “With SLB-CAM, there is not much in the way of overlapping businesses ... we do not envision an overly difficult antitrust review,” Oppenheimer analyst James Schumm said. Cameron’s shares were up about 41 percent at $60, below Schlumberger’s $66.36 per share cash-and-stock offer, in afternoon trading on Wednesday. Schlumberger’s shares fell as much as 7.5 percent to $68.01, their lowest in two-and-a-half years. The Macondo well explosion in April 2010 killed 11 workers and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Investigators found Cameron’s blowout preventer had battery and wiring troubles that hindered the proper functioning of the devices’ blind shear rams, which are designed to slice through drilling pipes and cap a well in an emergency. Cameron agreed to a $250 million settlement with BP PLC  to help pay for costs associated with the spill. Schlumberger’s offer on Wednesday values Cameron at $12.74 billion, based on the company’s diluted shares as of June 30. Cameron shareholders will get $14.44 in cash and 0.716 of a Schlumberger share for each share held. Schlumberger said it expects the deal to add to earnings by the end of the first year after the deal closes. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. Goldman Sachs & Co is Schlumberger’s financial adviser and Baker Botts LLP and Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP are its legal counsel.

244,SLB,UPDATE 1-Schlumberger bid for Eurasia stake could face new conditions -RIA,"* Schlumberger’s bid for EDC still to be cleared by Russian govt * Moscow in loggerheads with West over Ukraine   (Adds detail, quotes) MOSCOW, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The Russian government could set further conditions before approving U.S. company Schlumberger’s  bid for a stake in Russia’s Eurasia Drilling, news agency RIA reported on Tuesday citing the head of Russia’s anti-monopoly watchdog. The bid is seen as a test of Russian authorities amid a chill in relations with the West over the Ukrainian crisis. Schlumberger aims to buy a 45.65 percent stake in Eurasia for about $1.7 billion, potentially paving the way for it to become the sole owner of Russia’s most active oilfield services company. Initially broadly endorsed by Russia’s anti-monopoly body, the bid has been postponed several times. Igor Artemyev, head of Russia’s Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS), said the FAS had signed a nine-point agreement with Schlumberger regarding the bid last summer. A government commission must now make its decision on the deal. “I’m not sure if there will be requirements for any additional points, but any of the bodies may put forward their proposals,” RIA quoted Artemyev as saying. The deal to sell the stake to New York-listed Schlumberger has met with resistance in Russia’s higher echelons of power, according to a senior government official speaking on the condition of anonymity. A source, familiar with the deal, said that it was probably a clause in the contract which opens the door to Schlumberger taking control of Eurasia which has irked some authorities. A Schlumberger spokesman has said the company “is still committed to building on our successful collaboration with Eurasia Drilling Company and taking a minority position”. “Meanwhile, we are still awaiting on a formal response from the authorities,” he said. Yana Yakovleva, head of Moscow-based non-profit organisation Business Solidarity, said the government has taken Russian President Vladimir Putin’s advice to gradually refuse foreign help. “In the end, the party line to substitute imports will hit the effectiveness of domestic oil and gas production,” she said.

250,SLB,"Market recovery to take longer, hints at more cost cuts: Schlumberger","(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world’s No.1 oilfield services provider, suggested that it may have to reduce costs further and cut more jobs as it expects any rebound in drilling activity to now take longer than expected. Even if crude prices improve next year, weak cash flows would curtail the ability of oil and gas companies to increase spending on exploration and production, Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said in a statement. “In light of conservative customer budgets for next year, we are therefore entering another period during which we will continually adjust resources in line with activity,” Kibsgaard said on Thursday. Kibsgaard said the oil market is also weighed down by concerns of slowing Chinese demand and additional supply from Iran. Schlumberger said spending cuts by companies have been “dramatic”, but it did not say how much it expects oil and gas companies to cut spending in North America and internationally – a forecast it issued in the previous two quarters. Its last forecast, issued in July, was for a drop in spending of more than 35 percent in North America and more than 15 percent outside the region. “They know that the next two quarters are going to be very choppy and very tough so they want to make sure they are aligned for that,” Evercore ISI analyst James West said. “When they said they are going to manage their operations, it’s a good indication that headcount reductions will continue.” Schlumberger kicks off the earnings for oilfield services providers and its comments are closely watched for a glimpse into industry trends. Schlumberger has already cut 20,000 jobs this year and scaled back spending in response to weak crude prices, moves that helped its third-quarter profit marginally beat analysts’ average estimate. Net income attributable to Schlumberger nearly halved to $989 million, or 78 cents per share. Total revenue fell 33 percent to $8.47 billion, including a 47 percent drop in North America and an about 27 percent decline outside.

The company’s shares fell as much as 4.6 percent to $72.63 in late-morning trading. Rivals Halliburton Inc (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc BHI.N were also down about 4 percent.     “The likely timing gap between the oil price recovery and the subsequent increase in oilfield services activity in combination with a more conservative spending outlook from our customers is causing us to now take further action,” said Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a conference call on Friday. Exploration and production spending is expected to fall for a second consecutive year in 2016, a first since the 1986 downturn, Kibsgaard said. However, the OPEC members’ current spare capacity is less than 2 million barrels per day, compared with more than 10 million bpd in 1986. Schlumberger, whose comments are closely watched for a glimpse into industry trends, said the first quarter of 2016 would be weaker than the current quarter as customers tighten purse strings further, hurting the usual year-end sales of software, products and multi-client licenses.

257,SLB,"UPDATE 1-With global outlook weak, many U.S. companies tighten belts","(Updates estimates in paragraph 13 and adds day of Apple earnings announcement) By David Randall NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - U.S. companies are far from optimistic that next year will see them get a break from the tough economic and market conditions they have faced in 2015. And that may well hurt capital investment and jobs growth. In the first three weeks of October, 165 American companies have cited the slowing global economy in their outlooks for earnings and revenue. That is up from 108 in the same period last year, and 97 in the year-earlier quarter, according to an analysis of earnings reports by Thomson Reuters. Among the phrases that have appeared in many of those statements are “challenging macroeconomic environment,” or “global headwinds.” Earnings and revenue have been depressed this year largely because of the strong dollar, economic weakness in China and Brazil, and tumbling oil and commodities prices. The rise in the value of the American currency means that profits earned in foreign currencies are worth less when translated into dollars, possibly making American exports less competitive. The weakness in major emerging markets has hit sales by U.S. multinationals and the plunge in the prices of energy, metals and minerals have not only hit oil producers and miners but the manufacturing and service companies who sell to them. The problems are clearly not across the board, as shown by better-than-expected results reported last Thursday by technology heavyweights Amazon.com Inc, Google-owner Alphabet Inc, and Microsoft Corp. They are all benefiting from the expansion of cloud-based computing. But among the major companies to announce job cuts in recent weeks are industrial conglomerates United Technologies Corp  and General Electric Co, technology giant Hewlett-Packard Co., and the world’s largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger. Even social media company Twitter Inc, and biotechnology group Biogen Inc have said they are cutting jobs. Large employers announced 205,759 U.S. job cuts in the third quarter, the largest amount since the third quarter of 2009, according to a report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Caterpillar Inc, meanwhile, told analysts that it expects its capital spending to be “less than half of what it was in 2012,” while appliance maker Whirlpool Corp  lowered its capital spending for 2015 to between $700 million and $750 million, down from a previous forecast of $750 million to $800 million. Those moves are coming at a time when overall corporate earnings in the third quarter are on pace to fall by 2.8 percent from this time last year. So far 59 percent of companies have reported revenues that have fallen below analyst estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data. And expectations for 2016 are falling as well - in July analysts were predicting that corporate earnings per share in the first two quarters would grow 9.2 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively; those figures now are down to 4.7 percent for the first quarter and 6.2 percent for the second. The companies own forecasts, meanwhile, are falling short of expectations at the greatest pace since June 2014, according to a BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report. Companies “have a reason to be worried. This isn’t a major economic slowdown, but a meaningful one, and once you see a reduction in risk taking you will see a reduction in growth,” said Paul Hoffmeister, a portfolio manager with the Quaker Funds. Few expect the economy to go into a free-fall, of course. Should the dollar and oil prices stabilize, the prospects for many companies could improve quickly and their earnings and revenue could beat expectations, setting the stage for a stock rally. Some consumer-driven companies also continue to do well, both in the U.S. and even in China, where both Nike Inc  and toy-maker Mattel have said they still see high rates of growth. Apple Inc, which reports its quarterly results Tuesday, has said that China remains a big part of its growth plans. And some multinationals who have taken a pounding, such as household products giant Procter & Gamble Co, have signaled they may be turning a corner. P&G; said it sees sales growth strengthening in the second half of the year, as it focuses on more profitable lines such as Pampers diapers and Tide detergent. Many of those feeling the pinch from slowing growth overseas are the same companies that just a few years ago were counting on China and other emerging economies to bolster their bottom lines. For example, International Business Machines Corp, which cut its full-year profit forecast, said fewer big deals in China caused revenue from that country to fall 17 percent in the third quarter. Alan Gayle, a portfolio manager at RidgeWorth Investments, said that he has been increasingly moving more of his equity portfolio into U.S.-based companies that have limited exposure to China and other emerging markets. “I’ve pulled back from my China and emerging market exposure until there are clearer signs that the economy has stopped slowing,” he said, adding that he expects that top-line revenue growth will continue to be a challenge for U.S. companies there. Yet he remains guardedly optimistic that oil and other commodity prices are nearing a bottom, and that consumer spending in the U.S. and Europe should remain steady. “We think the chances of a global recession remain quite low,”  he said.

260,SLB,UPDATE 2-Schlumberger plans $10 bln share buyback as profit beats,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world’s No.1 oilfield services provider, unveiled a $10 billion share buyback program and  reported a slightly better-than-expected quarterly profit as it cut costs to weather a prolonged slump in oil prices. Schlumberger’s shares were up 2 percent at $62.85 in extended trading.  The company, whose comments are closely watched for an insight into the oil industry, said on Thursday that it cut 10,000 jobs in the fourth quarter. It had cut 20,000 jobs earlier in 2015. Schlumberger’s cost of revenue fell 35 percent in the three months ended Dec. 31, while revenue fell 39 percent. “With the year-end U.S. land rig count 68 percent lower than the 2014 peak, at less than 700 rigs, the massive over-capacity in the land services market offers no signs of pricing recovery in the short to medium term,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said. Oil and gas companies that use the services provided by Schlumberger and other oilfield companies have slashed spending by 50-70 percent in response to persistently weak oil prices. Oil companies could slash 2016 spending by around 20 percent if oil prices hover at $40, Barclays said in its annual survey of 225 companies worldwide released earlier this month.  Oil futures, however, were trading at about $30 on Thursday, after dropping to their lowest levels since 2003 earlier in the week on worries of a growing crude glut and slowing demand due to economic weakness, especially in China.    Net loss attributable to Schlumberger was $1.02 billion, or 81 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $302 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges of $1.46 per share, profit was 65 cents, above the average analyst estimate of 63 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

263,SLB,Schlumberger sees no pickup in oilfield activity before 2017,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said a “significant” recovery in oilfield activity was not expected until 2017, and he indicated that the company might struggle to meet analysts’ estimates for its current-quarter profit. Shares of the world’s largest oilfield services provider, which reported a better-than-expected profit on Thursday, rose as much as 8 percent.  “If we focus on (earnings per share), I would say that the current Q1 EPS consensus is probably a best-case scenario from what we can see today,” Kibsgaard said on a post-earnings call on Friday.  Analysts on average are expecting Schlumberger to post a profit of 55 cents in the first quarter ending March, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Demand for services provided by Schlumberger and its rivals is waning as oil companies tighten their belts in response to a 73 percent slide in global crude prices since June 2014. It would be “tough” to keep profit margins at current levels, Chief Financial Officer Simon Ayat said. The company, which also unveiled a $10 billion share buyback program on Thursday, expects investment in exploration and production to fall for the second straight year in 2016. Although North American oil companies have scaled back spending, their output remains high as they steer drilling rigs to the most prolific shale spots and frack wells more intensely. Production in North America and outside of OPEC is resilient because oil companies, looking to maximize cash flow, are keeping “taps wide open,” Kibsgaard said. “We still expect positive movement in oil prices during 2016 with specific timing being a function of the shape of the non-OPEC decline rates,” he said. Like its customers, Schlumberger has been cutting costs. The company said on Thursday it had laid off 10,000 employees in the fourth quarter, taking its total job cuts to 34,000, or 26 percent of its workforce, since November 2014. Kibsgaard, however, said he was “optimistic” the company would not have to cut more jobs in the current oil downturn. Schlumberger shares were up 3 percent at $63.39 in noon trading, after touching a high of $66.25 earlier.  Up to Thursday’s close, the stock had lost a quarter of its value in the past 12 months.

Here is a selection of comments by Kibsgaard from the call: “The apparent resilience in production outside of OPEC and in North America is, in many cases, driven by producers opening the taps wide open to maximize cash flow, which also means that we will likely see higher decline rates after these short-term actions are exhausted.” “So while the global oil market is still being weighed down by fears of reduced growth in Chinese demand, the magnitude of additional uranium exports, and the continued various trends in global inventories, we still expect ... positive movement in oil prices during 2016, with specific timing being a function of the shape of the non-OPEC decline rates.” “ ... Market outlook for oilfield services in the coming quarters will remain challenging as the pressure on activity and service pricing is set to continue.” “ ... 2016 E&P; investment levels will fall for a second successive year ... any significant recovery in our activity levels will be a 2017 event.” “I am at this stage optimistic that we have completed the workforce reductions required in this downturn.” ",1222016,http://www.reuters.com/article/schlumberger-results-quotes/quotebox-schlumberger-ceo-sees-no-significant-recovery-in-activity-before-2017-idUSL3N1563WG

268,SLB,Exclusive: EU to give unconditional approval to Schlumberger deal - sources,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The world’s biggest oilfield services company Schlumberger (SLB.N) is set to gain unconditional EU approval for its $14.8 billion bid for equipment maker Cameron International Corp CAM.N, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday. The acquisition will enable Schlumberger to offer a broader range of products at lower prices to oil companies, which are slashing spending in response to falling oil prices, and boost its market share. Antitrust experts have said the two U.S. companies offer complementary product lines, meaning the deal would draw less regulatory scrutiny. Schlumberger’s relatively smooth passage with regulators contrasts with a larger proposed energy services tie-up, Halliburton’s (HAL.N) proposed $35 billion takeover of Baker Hughes BHI.N, which has stirred worries with watchdogs on both sides of the Atlantic. It is now the target of a full-scale investigation by the European Commission because of concerns it could push up prices for oil and gas exploration in Europe. Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. Schlumberger spokesman Joao Felix said the company typically does not discuss merger and acquisition opportunities. Cameron International did not immediately reply to an email for comment. The EU competition enforcer is scheduled to decide on the deal by Feb. 5. U.S. antitrust regulators cleared the deal without conditions in November last year. The companies expect to close the merger in the first quarter. Schlumberger last week said it would cut 10,000 jobs in the fourth quarter amid a prolonged oil price slump.

273,SLB,U.S. labour market on solid ground as jobless rate hits eight-year low,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. employment gains slowed more than expected in January as the boost to hiring from unseasonably mild weather faded, but rising wages and an unemployment rate at an eight-year low suggested the labor market recovery remains firm. Non-farm payrolls increased by 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate slipped one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.9 percent, the lowest since February 2008, the Labor Department said on Friday. The payrolls gain was a sharp step-down from the average 231,000 jobs per month during the fourth quarter. “The fact that payroll gains fell back to earth is not necessarily a bad sign. Most indications are that the job market in the U.S. is on solid footing and improving,” said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS in Lexington, Massachusetts. Economists had forecast employment increasing by 190,000 in January and the jobless rate steady at 5 percent. The economy added 2,000 fewer jobs in November and December than previously reported. On top of a 0.5 percent jump in average hourly earnings, which was the biggest gain in a year, employers increased hours for workers. Manufacturing, which has been undermined by a strong dollar and weak global demand, added the most jobs since August 2013. Economists said the combination of strong wage growth and falling unemployment suggested a March interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve could not be completely ruled out. The dollar rose against a basket of six major currencies on the data after hitting a roughly 15-week low on Thursday. Prices for U.S. government debt initially fell, but pared losses as stocks on Wall Street extended their decline.  “The lower unemployment rate and rising wages further support the view that the labor market is doing nothing but tightening,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. “Clearly, there are more uncertainties today than when the Fed raised rates in December and hinted that there could be four increases this year. But the labor market is absolutely not one of them.” Tightening financial market conditions and signs that both the domestic and global economies were slowing had undercut the case for a Fed rate hike next month and lowered the probability of monetary policy tightening this year. The U.S. central bank raised its short-term interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade.  Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.  The economy, especially voters’ perceptions of their job prospects, will likely be an issue in the November elections. President Barack Obama lauded the labor market progress. “This progress is finally starting to translate into bigger paychecks. The United States of America right now has the strongest, most durable economy in the world,” Obama told reporters at the White House.  Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, however, said the economy was “still failing the millions of Americans who have given up looking for work.”  January’s softer job gains were payback after the warmest temperatures in years bolstered hiring in weather-sensitive sectors like construction. January employment also lost the lift from the hiring of couriers and messengers, which was buoyed in November and December by strong online holiday sales. The economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, restrained by headwinds that included the strong dollar and efforts by businesses to sell off inventory.  A separate report from the Commerce Department showed the buoyant dollar cutting into exports in December, causing the trade deficit to widen 2.7 percent to $43.4 billion. In January, the unemployment rate fell even as more people entered the labor force. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.7 percent. It remains near four-decade lows.  Low participation could crimp job growth as the supply of labor shrinks, unless a strong rise in wages lures more people back into the labor force. The private sector accounted for all employment gains in January, adding 158,000 positions.  The services sector created 118,000 jobs, the fewest in 10 months. That was because temporary help services fell 25,200 and courier and messenger employment declined by 14,400 jobs. Hiring in these categories normally rises during the holiday season. Educational services lost 38,500 jobs, but retail payrolls added a strong 57,700 positions. Hiring could slow in the months ahead after a number of retailers, including Walmart (WMT.N) and Macy’s (M.N) announced dozens of store closures. The embattled manufacturing sector surprisingly added 29,000 jobs last month, while mining laid off 7,000 more workers. Mining payrolls have decreased by 146,000 since peaking in September 2014. About three-fourths of the job losses over this period have been in support activities for mining.  Further losses are likely after a report on Thursday showed energy firms in January announced plans to lay off 20,246 workers. Oil prices have plunged about 70 percent in the last 18 months, forcing firms like oilfield services provider Schlumberger (SLB.N) to slash their workforces. Construction payrolls rose 18,000, cooling off after adding 146,000 jobs in the fourth quarter. Government employment fell 7,000.

275,SLB,US companies tipped to sell euro debt in record numbers in 2016,"NEW YORK/LONDON, Feb 11 (IFR) - US companies are lining up euro deals that could give the moribund European corporate bond market a much needed boost after a dire start to the year. US issuers have already borrowed 2.3bn this year, around a quarter of the total euro corporate supply, and a new wave of issuers are readying deals to take advantage of lower yields and more stable spreads after the US primary market stayed shut for the fifth straight day on Thursday. Goldman Sachs tapped euros for the second time in less than a week on Wednesday, following a number of corporate issuers over the past fortnight that have sold euro deals - including oil outfit Schlumberger and industrial gases company Praxair. Bankers are now preparing potential bonds from technology and manufacturing company Honeywell, biotech group Amgen and aircraft manufacturer United Technologies, tipped to be a bumper multi-tranched bond, according to leads on the deal. A record number of US corporates issued in the euro market last year, accounting for 57bn of the 253bn issued in the European investment-grade market, according to IFR data. LOWER ALL-IN The main reason for the interest is lower yields in the euro market, which are especially appealing for US borrowers keeping funds in the single currency. That attraction could grow if the Federal Reserve embarks on more rate hikes, while at the same time the European Central Bank contemplates more easing. Marc Fratepietro, co-head of Americas investment-grade debt capital markets at Deutsche Bank, put the differential between the two currencies for some companies at up to 150bp. Schlumberger, for example, raised 600m from a three-year deal last week at a yield of 0.674% - a fraction of the 2.35% it paid on a US$1.3bn three-year sold back in December. Even higher-than-average premiums sparked by the recent volatility are not expected to deter US companies - which are more pragmatic than their European counterparts - from targeting euros. “US issuers are not as price sensitive versus secondaries as Europeans. Some print euros only once a year so they won’t split hairs,” one European DCM official said. Others point out that European spreads have held up relatively well in the recent sell-off. “In the midst of the recent market volatility dollar spreads underperformed their euro counterparts for the same issuers,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch credit analyst Yuriy Shchuchinov said in a note published Wednesday. He estimated that dollar spreads of European issuers have widened 20bp relative to euros since mid-January (adjusted for the cross-currency basis) and put the differential at 44bp, the widest since January 2015. US issuers’ dollar spreads also underperformed euros, but to a smaller extent, he added. However, for those companies thinking about swapping back to US dollars, the economics are not as attractive. “For a company to issue in euros and then swap it back to dollars it would cost them a lot, around 40bp on the five-year,” another banker told IFR. Two years ago that would only have cost 8bp, and last year around 25bp. But bankers said the majority of US issuers looking to tap euros actually want the euro exposure. “Issuing in euros creates a hedge for their European businesses, because now they’re match funding their European activities with their euro debt,” the banker said. “In a world where the euro is expected to depreciate the value of the currency hedge is pretty meaningful to them.”   (Reporting by Hillary Flynn and Laura Benitez; Editing by Natalie Harrison, Helene Durand and Julian Baker)",2112016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-corporatebonds-euros/us-companies-tipped-to-sell-euro-debt-in-record-numbers-in-2016-idUSL2N15K2C2
276,SLB,BAE Systems lines up oil exec Woodburn as next CEO: source,"LONDON (Reuters) - British defense company BAE Systems (BAES.L) has picked former oil industry executive Charles Woodburn as heir apparent to Chief Executive Ian King, a source close to the situation said on Sunday. Woodburn, who has worked at oilfield services company Schlumberger (SLB.N) and is currently chief executive at private equity-backed Expro, is likely to be appointed as BAE Systems’ chief operating officer this week before taking the top job in 12 to 18 months, the source said. Reports last year said that BAE Systems had started a search to find the replacement for King, who has been in the role since 2008 and has had to navigate cuts in defense spending by the British and United States governments, BAE’s biggest customers. The company is set to embark on major new projects in the next few years, including building the replacement for Britain’s Vanguard nuclear submarines.  Woodburn’s appointment, which was first reported by Sky News, is a departure from BAE Systems’ tradition of choosing an insider to the top job. BAE Systems, which reports full-year results on Thursday, declined to comment.

277,SLB,Schlumberger expects first quarter revenue to fall 15 percent from fourth quarter,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world’s largest oilfield services provider, said revenue in the current quarter is expected to fall 15 percent from the fourth, as spending cuts by oil producers take a toll. The company forecast revenue of $6.5 billion for the first quarter ending March, lower than the average analyst estimate of $6.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The third phase of E&P; spending reductions that we are currently experiencing will have a significant impact on our earnings per share in the current and coming quarters,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said at an energy conference on Monday. Kibsgaard, whose comments are closely watched, also called for a change in the way the oil and gas industry operates. There is an urgent need for a change in the way the energy industry works given that oil prices are expected to be “medium-for-longer”, Kibsgaard said in his keynote address at the Scotia Howard Weil Energy Conference. The cost reductions by oil and natural gas producers over the past 18 months were not linked to efficiency improvements, Kibsgaard said, adding they were the result of pricing concessions from oilfield services providers.     Under the current model, oil producers split drilling and production work into smaller parts, and then seek bids from service providers. But this model has led to inefficiencies due to a lack of collaboration between operators and suppliers, Kibsgaard said. Schlumberger — which is buying equipment maker Cameron International Corp CAM.N for $14.8 billion deal — is developing total drilling and production systems to move away from single components, Kibsgaard said. Kibsgaard also hinted at more job cuts, saying the company will continue to match costs and resources to activity.  Schlumberger has cut 34,000 jobs, or 26 percent of its workforce, since November 2014. The company’s shares were marginally higher at $73.82 in early trading.

279,SLB,"U.S. Justice Dept will sue to stop Halliburton, Baker Hughes merger: source","(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department will file a lawsuit as soon as this week to stop oilfield services provider Halliburton Co from acquiring smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The antitrust lawsuit could potentially scupper the deal that was first announced in November 2014 to combine the No. 2 and No. 3 oil services companies. Since then, oil prices have fallen by more than 55 percent.  Faced with opposition from the Justice Department, the companies may either cancel the planned tie-up or fight the government in court. The deal is one of several that antitrust enforcers have rejected as illegal during the recent wave of mergers of large, complex companies. Share prices for Baker Hughes closed down 5.1 percent at $39.36 Tuesday while Halliburton ended up 1.2 percent at $34.40. Halliburton and Baker Hughes both declined comment. The two sides had been discussing asset sales aimed at saving the deal, which was originally valued at $35 billion but is now valued at about $25 billion based on the decline in Halliburton shares.  If the deal collapses due to antitrust concerns, Halliburton must pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee, according to regulatory filings. The proposed deal also has hit headwinds in Europe, where the European Union’s competition authority was concerned that the proposed merger would reduce competition and innovation in more than 30 product markets. Regulators in Australia also flagged concerns about the massive tie-up. As far back as July 2015, Reuters reported that there were concerns in the U.S. government that the merger would lead to higher prices and less innovation. The Justice Department’s worry then focused on two areas. One was that the drilling technology businesses that were divested would go to small companies that could not effectively compete with the two leaders. The other was that the leaders would have less incentive to innovate. Baker Hughes in particular has been aggressive in developing new oilfield technologies, part of its appeal to Halliburton from the beginning. Baker Hughes developed smartphone apps to help customers in the field decide in real time how best to hydraulically fracture new wells.  Furthermore, uniting Halliburton and Baker Hughes would create a dominant leader in North Dakota with more than half the cementing market and a leading position in fracking. Lower oil prices had given investors hope that the companies’ best path forward was together, especially as demand for their products and services evaporate as customers slashed budgets. The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, which enforce antitrust law, have filed lawsuits to stop a surprising number of deals in the past 18 months. The FTC stopped food distribution giant Sysco Corp from buying US Foods Inc in 2015, and is currently in court fighting Staples’ merger with Office Depot. The Justice Department, working with the Federal Communications Commission, stopped Comcast Corp from buying Time Warner Cable in 2015.

282,SLB,Schlumberger to limit Venezuela operations on payment problems,"(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Schlumberger Ltd said it would reduce its operations in Venezuela due to payment problems, a further sign of the cash crunch facing the OPEC nation because of weak oil markets.  Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, the exclusive operator of the country’s oilfields, has built up billions of dollars in unpaid bills to service providers as a result of cash-flow problems.  “Schlumberger appreciates the efforts of its main customer in the country to find alternative payment solutions and remains fully committed to supporting the Venezuelan exploration and production industry,” the company said in a statement.  “However, Schlumberger is unable to increase its accounts receivable balances beyond their current level.” The company said the reduction will take place through this month, allowing for a safe wind-down of operations. Schlumberger in 2013 gave PDVSA a $1 billion credit line to allow it to continue delivering services despite the accumulating debts. It took a $49 million loss last year due to Venezuela’s currency devaluation and another $472 million in 2014 for the same reason.   PDVSA in a statement said it “categorically denies information reflected in certain international media regarding a supposed reduction in operations by services firm Schlumberger, Ltd.”  It added that “additional work required by the corporation will be distributed to other companies that provide similar services,” without elaborating.

294,SLB,UPDATE 2-Ophir ends talks with Schlumberger over Equatorial Guinea project,"* Ends equity, funding talks with Schlumberger over Fortuna * Ophir in talks with other parties that could offer funding * Now sees first investment decision in Q4 vs. mid-2016 earlier * Stock falls as much as 25 pct, second biggest FTSE midcap loser   (Adds analyst comments, details, updates share movement) By Esha Vaish April 29 (Reuters) - Ophir Energy Plc said it had ended talks to partner with Schlumberger on its Fortuna project in Equatorial Guinea, leaving the oil and gas explorer to hunt for alternatives to move the project forward. Ophir said it had been unable to complete the deal for its Fortuna project on the terms agreed in January, when it signed a preliminary contract with the world’s largest oilfield services provider. Shares in Ophir, which had projects in Africa and East Asia, fell as much as 25 percent on Friday, eroding the company’s market value by over 160 million pounds ($233 million). Ophir CEO Nick Cooper said the company was in talks with a number of other “quality counterparties” that could offer funding. He did not disclose any names. Stifel analysts said Schlumberger’s exit had put a question mark on the read-through value of the project, especially as the deal had fallen through after the U.S. company had done its due diligence. Fortuna, Africa’s first deepwater independent floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, is one of a number of projects planned when prices were higher. The field is expected to produce 2.2 million tons per annum and Ophir currently has an 80 percent working interest in the field, according to its website. Under the head of terms agreement signed in January, Schlumberger had agreed to take a 40 percent economic interest in the project. The company would have reimbursed Ophir for half of its previous costs in the project, which was expected to help cover Ophir’s share of capital expenditure up until first gas sales. “(Schlumberger’s exit) raises obvious questions how Ophir can move the project forward,” Liberum analyst Andrew Whittock told Reuters. Ophir pushed back expectations for a first investment decision on the project on Friday, saying it would take time to reach binding deals with other potential partners. A decision on first investment will be made in the fourth quarter of 2016 and first production will is expected by early 2020, the company added. It had earlier expected to make its investment decision in mid-2016, with production in 2019. Ophir shares had pared some of their earlier losses by 1000 GMT, but were still on track for their worst day ever. The stock, down 18 percent at 75 pence, was the second-largest percentage loser on London’s midcap index.

299,SLB,UPDATE 1-Equatorial Guinea says Schlumberger walked away from Fortuna project,"(Updates with quote, details) CAPE TOWN, June 6 (Reuters) - Equatorial Guinea’s energy minister on Monday said Schlumberger had walked away from the country’s Fortuna floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) project but he also said he was confident it would be successful. Fortuna, Africa’s first deep-water independent floating liquefied natural gas project, is one of a number planned when energy prices were higher. The offshore field is expected to produce 2.2 million tonnes per annum. Oil and gas explorer Ophir Energy in April said it had ended talks with Schlumberger over the U.S. company’s upstream participation in Fortuna. Energy minister Obiang Lima said he was confident the project would go ahead and be successful, with Equatorial Guinea taking an equity stake via its state-owned companies. “Some people were a little bit hesitant after Schlumberger left but the problem with Schlumberger is that they wanted to monopolise everything and we don’t want that,”  Lima told Reuters on the sidelines of an oil and gas conference in Cape Town. “Some people thought they left because the project was not profitable. That is not the case - it was because they wanted to do everything and we cannot allow one service company to do everything,” he said. Schlumberger was not immediately available to comment. Ophir said it was talking to a range of equity investors, as well as gas buyers, to help to finance the project. “We’ve done all the work in a very difficult environment to deliver a very investable project, (including) bringing down the capital costs of first gas by half to what they were 12 months ago, to $450 million, which is huge,”  Bill Higgs, Ophir’s chief operating officer, said.

308,SLB,UPDATE 1-Venezuela PDVSA near deals to boost Schlumberger presence -executive,"(Adds Schlumberger declines to comment) By Alexandra Ulmer CARACAS, June 11 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state oil company, PDVSA, is close to reaching deals to boost Schlumberger’s   presence after the oilfield services provider said in April it would reduce operations because of payment problems, PDVSA’s president told Reuters. PDVSA, the exclusive operator of the OPEC country’s vast oilfields, has run up billions of dollars in unpaid bills to service providers as a result of cash-flow problems. U.S. oil services company Halliburton Co in April also said it would begin curtailing activity in Venezuela. Eulogio Del Pino, president of PDVSA, on Friday night said some of Schlumberger’s operations had been reduced but added others were being reinforced. “There are 14 Schlumberger drills that will start operations soon under a different financing scheme,” said Del Pino, without elaborating. “And in the case of the (Maracaibo) lake rigs, we’ll also reach a deal for a different kind of operation,” he added, in reference to Schlumberger’s very specific jack-up rigs that are crucial for production in the western Maracaibo area. Schlumberger declined to comment. The company in 2013 gave PDVSA a $1 billion credit line to allow it to continue delivering services despite the accumulating debts. It took a $49 million loss last year when  Venezuela devalued its currency and a $472 million loss in 2014 for the same reason. Schlumberger’s decision to wind down operations heightened fears over Venezuela’s oil operations, which are already suffering from lack of spare parts, a brain drain, crime and maintenance issues.

317,SLB,Schlumberger sees oil supply deficit if demand growth holds,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd, the world’s No. 1 oilfield services provider, said it expects a “significant global supply deficit” of crude oil, assuming steady growth in demand, given the sharp decline in spending on exploration and production. Energy companies have halved their E&P; budgets since oil prices began their slump in June 2014, scaling back drilling to focus on the most prolific oil fields, a strategy called high-grading. “As the opportunities for activity high-grading are exhausted, we should see a further acceleration in the global production decline,” Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on an earnings conference call on Friday. The IEA, which coordinates the energy policies of industrial nations, earlier this month raised its forecast for global oil demand growth by 0.1 million barrels per day (bpd) to 1.4 million bpd in 2016 and 1.3 million bpd in 2017. Schlumberger reported a better-than-expected adjusted profit for the second quarter on Thursday, and said it was considering rolling back pricing concessions. The view echoed that of smaller rival Halliburton Co, which said on Wednesday that “deep, uneconomic pricing cuts” would have to be reversed. “Inevitably service industry pricing has to recover and as it does, this will consume a large part of the E&P; investment increases intended for additional activity, which will further amplify the pending oil supply deficit,” Kibsgaard said. Oil producers have said their ability to keep pumping oil without spending more was due to lower prices for oilfield services and better production techniques that drastically lower costs for each new well, while yielding more oil. But Kibsgaard said the low costs were not indicative of a “permanent improvement in the underlying industry performance”, emphasizing there had be no fundamental changes in technology, quality efficiency, collaboration or the industry’s business model. “What has taken place over the past 21 months is instead a redistribution of the profit and cash flow shortfall from previously sitting mostly with the oil producers to now representing an unsustainable burden for the supply industry.” Schlumberger’s shares were down 0.7 percent at $79.43.

321,SLB,Hess seeks over $40 mln from Schlumberger in valve dispute,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Hess Corp said on Wednesday it was pursuing legal action against Schlumberger NV for $40 million or more, claiming the oilfield service provider supplied a defective valve for a U.S. Gulf of Mexico oilfield that shuttered three wells and crimped production. Hess took the unusual step of announcing the move on its quarterly earnings conference call, publicly mentioning Schlumberger and decrying the quality of service and parts provided. Oil producers such as Hess have been battling with Schlumberger and other oilfield service providers over price and other financial matters at a time when depressed crude prices  have eroded profits for the entire industry. “It’s extremely disappointing,” Greg Hill, chief operating officer at Hess, said on the earnings call of the alleged defective valve. Schlumberger representatives were not immediately available to comment. Hess executives claimed the company is owed between $30 million and $40 million in remediation fees from the shutdown of some wells at its deepwater Tubular Bells field, roughly 135 miles (217 km) southeast of New Orleans. The company later in the day said it would seek even more from Schlumberger for legal costs and other claims, though Hess representatives declined to specify the full amount they would seek. Two of Tubular’s four wells had been closed in the second quarter for regular maintenance that was supposed to last 31 days. But Hess said a faulty valve earlier this month forced the closure of another well. As a result, Hess slashed its production outlook from the Tubular project to about 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) for the year, down from previous estimates for at least 25,000 boepd. “It relates to some quality control and some of the components of the valve,” Hill said. He did not say if Hess had filed a lawsuit or was seeking arbitration. No filings from Hess appeared in U.S. court records as of Wednesday afternoon. Hess said it expects the platform to be fully back online later this year. Hess holds a stake of about 57 percent in the Tubular project, with Chevron Corp holding the rest.

329,SLB,Schlumberger lets go of workers in Venezuela as it scales back,"CARACAS/PUNTO FIJO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Oilfield services company Schlumberger has let go of workers and pulled out of projects as it cuts operations in crisis-stricken Venezuela, sparking worker protests and heightening worry over the OPEC country’s slumping oil output. Schlumberger in April said it would reduce activity in the South American OPEC nation, which accounted for less than 5 percent of the company’s consolidated revenue last year, due to insufficient payments and no improvements on the horizon.  As a result, employees working on projects ranging from the oil-rich Maracaibo Lake to the Orinoco Belt are being laid off, workers and a union leader said, an ominous sign for Venezuela’s slumping crude production and crumbling economy.  “They’re getting rid of almost all the workers because they’re reducing operations and the contracts won’t be renovated because of debt owed by PDVSA,” said a Schlumberger employee in Venezuela’s eastern city of Maturin, asking to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak with media.  Houston-based Schlumberger declined to comment. Caracas-based PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. Ivan Freites, a union leader and fierce PDVSA critic, said some 600 workers are being fired in Zulia state, whose capital is Maracaibo, and 2,000 workers are being let go nationally. While the exact number of laid-off workers was not immediately clear, the dismissals could further stoke social unrest as Venezuelans struggle to eat three meals a day amid worsening food shortages and triple-digit inflation. Some Schlumberger workers protested the layoffs in Maracaibo on Wednesday.  A worker in Venezuela’s oil-rich Orinoco Belt said Schlumberger had scaled back its projects and was now only working on Petropiar, a joint venture between PDVSA and U.S. oil company Chevron, and Petromonagas, a joint venture between PDVSA and Russian oil giant Rosneft.  PDVSA, exclusive operator of Venezuela’s vast oilfields, has run up billions of dollars in unpaid bills to service providers as a result of cash-flow problems amid a deep recession.  U.S. oil services company Halliburton Co in April also said it would begin curtailing activity in Venezuela. It also declined to comment on its scale-back.      PDVSA’s president Eulogio Del Pino told Reuters in June that it was close to reaching a deal with Schlumberger to boost services again, but there have been no details on the potential agreement. Schlumberger’s declining presence comes as Venezuelan oil fields suffer from lack of spare parts, a brain drain, crime, and maintenance issues.     The country’s crude output fell to some 2.364 million barrels per day in June, from 2.675 million in the same month last year, according to data OPEC says was provided by Venezuela. The drop could help erode a supply glut that has weighed on prices. Of course, Schlumberger and Halliburton’s dwindling operations in Venezuela could also provide opportunities for their rivals. One Schlumberger source said a PDVSA unit and Bohai Drilling Service, a unit of China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), were pocketing some of the contracts. An official at Bohai declined to comment and CNPC, China’s top energy group, did not respond to a request for comment.

335,SLB,Schlumberger profit beats as North America activity ramps up,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd, the world’s No.1 oilfield services provider, reported a quarterly profit that topped analysts’ expectations as more oil producers put rigs back to work in North America. The company expects improved activity in onshore North American, Middle Eastern and Russian markets next year, Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on Thursday, although he warned of limited visibility into customers’ investment plans for 2017. Halliburton Co, the No.2 oilfield services provider, said on Wednesday that oil prices would have to stabilize at above $50 per barrel for producers to meaningfully increase oilfield activity. Schlumberger is already seeing gains from the North American rig count, which has risen for 15 of the last 16 weeks. Excluding results from Cameron International Corp, which Schlumberger acquired earlier this year, Schlumberger’s third-quarter land revenue in North America rose 14 percent from the second quarter. Higher drilling and fracturing drove the increase, Schlumberger said, adding that pricing improvements were limited as much of the increase in activity was driven by small companies.  Schlumberger, which was historically tilted toward the big oil companies, has been moving “downmarket” to smaller producers, said Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai. The company is also gaining from a contract rider that ties service pricing to oil prices, Desai said. Global crude oil prices have risen nearly 40 percent this year and Kibsgaard said on Thursday that global crude oil supply and demand were “now more or less balanced.”  Strict cost control has helped Schlumberger offset revenue declines caused by a steep fall in exploration and production spending that eroded demand for its services. The company’s pro forma revenue had slumped more than 50 percent in the previous seven quarters, Kibsgaard said, adding that the company had cut $6 billion of costs over the period. “After calling the bottom of the cycle in the second quarter of this year, our business stabilized in the third quarter.”  Net profit attributable to Schlumberger fell to $176 million, or $13 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $989 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to the Cameron merger and integration, Schlumberger earned 25 cents per share, above the analysts’ average estimate of 22 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 17 percent to $7.02 billion, shy of analysts’ estimate of 7.08 billion. Schlumberger’s shares have gained nearly a fifth of their value this year up to Thursday’s close of $82.99.

Shares in the company rose as much as 13.8 percent, before trading at 77.75 pence at 0956 GMT on the London Stock Exchange on Thursday. Ophir said earlier this month that it could go forward without new partners for the Fortuna floating liquefied natural gas project as the cost estimates had halved to around $450 million. Schlumberger had walked away from the deal in June.  Jefferies analysts said the return of Schlumberger would be looked at positively by the market. The brokerage has a “hold” rating on the stock. Ophir said it would have a 33.8 percent stake in the joint operating company, while OneLNG would own the rest. The company expects the final investment decision to take place in the first half of 2017, with first gas expected in the first half of 2020. The final decision is subject to approval by Ophir shareholders and clearance from the government of Equatorial Guinea. Capital expenditure for the integrated project is expected to be about $2 billion to reach first gas, of which about $1.2 billion is expected to be debt-financed. “Ophir’s committed future expenditure to first gas will not exceed $150 million and certain other commercial exposures have been limited. We will now be able to advance the project while preserving our balance sheet strength,” Ophir CEO Nick Cooper said.

348,SLB,Schlumberger expects international markets recovery in late 2017,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger NV said on Friday that it does not expect a “dramatic” short-term recovery in international markets, compared with North America where shale producers are already ramping up drilling activity. The world’s No.1 oilfield services provider reported a more-than-8-percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue as strong activity in the Middle East and North America was offset by weakness in Latin America, Europe, Russia and Africa. “Our international business is currently like a highly-compressed coiled spring,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on an analyst call. “Activity levels in key market segments such as exploration and deepwater are at record lows and although we do not expect a dramatic short-term recovery, the trends can only be positive from this point on.” With crude oil prices on the rise, oil companies have begun to ramp up exploration and production spending, particularly in North American shale fields, after two years of budget cuts. However, Kibsgaard expects a global increase to unfold only later this year – a view that Edward Jones analyst Rob Desai agreed with. “The end of 2017 is when you start to see things really improve in international markets,” Desai said. Schlumberger’s earnings from international markets, including Mexico, Venezuela, Brazil, Sub-Sahara Africa, China and onshore Russia, in the fourth quarter of 2016 was more than 70 percent lesser than its earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014, when oil prices began to slump. The company is far more reliant on markets outside North America than its rivals Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc. Schlumberger gets only a quarter of its revenue from North America, while Halliburton gets more than 40 percent. Schlumberger’s fourth-quarter revenue from North America rose 4 percent to $1.77 billion compared with the third quarter. Desai said he had expected a 6 percent increase, given the roughly 22 percent rise in average U.S. rig count in the period. Schlumberger’s revenue growth in international markets was slower, rising 1 percent to $5.28 billion from the third to the fourth quarter. Net loss attributable to Schlumberger fell to $204 million, or 15 cents per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, from $1.02 billion, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier. bit.ly/2jGqJn7 Excluding one-time items, Schlumberger earned 27 cents per share, in-line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Companies in the industry have had to adjust to lower prices after oil tumbled from a peak of over $100 a barrel in 2014. The paper deal valued Amec Foster Wheeler shares at 5.64 pence each and they traded close to that level at 1010 GMT. Wood Group shares also responded positively, gaining 5 percent to 7.93 pounds. Amec Foster Wheeler, itself the product of a 2014 merger, said it had been planning to announce a rights issue next week and to announce the suspension of dividend payments to cut costs and boost cashflow. The rights issue has been suspended. “The combination represents a transformational transaction for Wood Group, which accelerates our strategy and creates a global leader in project, engineering and technical services delivery across a range of industrial sectors,” said Wood Group Chairman Ian Marchant. Amec Foster Wheeler investors will receive 0.75 new Wood Group shares for each share held, the company said. They will own 44 percent of the merger group but Wood Group executives will take the top jobs. Wood Group Chief Executive Robin Watson and Chief Financial Officer David Kemp will keep the same jobs in the new group. Wood Group Chairman Marchant will also retain his role. Wood Group said it expected annual cost savings to reach at least 110 million pounds, while the one-off costs would be around 190 million pounds. “While materially above our AMFW valuation, we can see WG consolidating its market-leading UK North Sea business, expanding product lines in the US and possibly increasing the scope for asset sales,” Jefferies analyst Mark Wilson said. Oilfield service companies have looked to acquisitions to offset weak demand and heavy discounting for its equipment and services due to several years of low crude prices. General Electric Co agreed to merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc in October to create the world’s second-largest oilfield services provider. Larger rival Halliburton Co had earlier tried to buy Baker Hughes to compete for customers with Schlumberger NV , the world’s largest oilfield service provider. JPMorgan acted as lead adviser to Wood Group, securing a key role on another big UK deal this year after Standard Life’s merger with Aberdeen and Tesco’s purchase of Booker. Credit Suisse, which works with Wood Group as corporate broker, also helped the company on the deal while Goldman Sachs advised Amec Foster Wheeler.

364,SLB,Schlumberger sees Ecuador's unpaid bills hurting quarterly results,"HOUSTON/QUITO (Reuters) - OPEC production cuts and economic woes are complicating Schlumberger NV’s (SLB.N) efforts to collect $1.1 billion from Ecuador’s state-owned Petroamazonas, casting a cloud over the oil services company’s first-quarter results.  “Continuing payment issues” in Ecuador are hurting earnings, Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said in a text of a speech delivered at the Scotia Howard Weil energy conference in New Orleans on Monday. Earlier this month, Kibsgaard wrote to Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa seeking to resolve an impasse over unpaid bills that he said was causing Schlumberger “considerable financial stress.”  Kibsgaard wrote that talks between top Schlumberger executives and Ecuadorean ministry officials since October “have made no real progress,” according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.  “The situation is obviously not sustainable in the long run,” he wrote, adding that Schlumberger was forced to expand debt to finance operations in the country.   Schlumberger did not respond to requests for comment.  Ecuador’s Ministry of Hydrocarbons declined to confirm the talks. The government has acknowledged some problems with payments to oil companies, without specifying which ones. Ecuador’s economy has been hurt by the global oil-price downturn and two major earthquakes that killed more than 660, injured 6,300 and caused damages estimated at up to $3 billion. Ecuador is holding a presidential election on Sunday. A leftist Correa ally is slightly ahead in the polls. Analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters estimate Schlumberger’s first-quarter earnings at 27 cents a share, compared with 40 cents a share a year earlier. The company is expected to report results on April 21.  The company has invested $3 billion to date in Ecuador under contracts signed earlier this decade to expand production at two oilfields, out of total investment that was to reach $4.9 billion over 20 years.  Schlumberger earlier this year reported accounts receivable as of Dec. 31 rose 7 percent over a year earlier, to $9.39 billion, while 2016 revenue slid 40 percent, to $27.92 billion.  Schlumberger earlier stumbled in its efforts to be paid for work in financially hard-hit Venezuela, another member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Last April, it cut local workers and pulled out of projects with Petroleos de Venezuela due to a lack of payments by the state-owned oil company. Payment under one deal in Ecuador was to come from a tariff on incremental oil production in the Auca oil field, one of the largest in the country. That has been hampered after Ecuador cut output there by about 10,000 barrels a day to meet its quota under a November agreement by OPEC. Since 2014, Halliburton Co (HAL.N), another oilfield services provider, also has a contract with Petroamazonas that calls for it to invest $1 billion over five years. A Halliburton spokeswoman on Tuesday declined to comment on its operations in the country.

Ecuador’s economy has been hurt by the global oil-price downturn and two major earthquakes that killed more than 660, injured 6,300 and caused damages estimated at up to $3 billion. Ecuador is holding a presidential election on Sunday. A leftist Correa ally is slightly ahead in the polls. Analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters estimate Schlumberger’s first-quarter earnings at 27 cents a share, compared with 40 cents a share a year earlier. The company is expected to report results on April 21.  The company has invested $3 billion to date in Ecuador under contracts signed earlier this decade to expand production at two oilfields, out of total investment that was to reach $4.9 billion over 20 years.  Schlumberger earlier this year reported accounts receivable as of Dec. 31 rose 7 percent over a year earlier, to $9.39 billion, while 2016 revenue slid 40 percent, to $27.92 billion.  Schlumberger earlier stumbled in its efforts to be paid for work in financially hard-hit Venezuela, another member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Last April, it cut local workers and pulled out of projects with Petroleos de Venezuela due to a lack of payments by the state-owned oil company. Payment under one deal in Ecuador was to come from a tariff on incremental oil production in the Auca oil field, one of the largest in the country. That has been hampered after Ecuador cut output there by about 10,000 barrels a day to meet its quota under a November agreement by OPEC. Since 2014, Halliburton Co (HAL.N), another oilfield services provider, also has a contract with Petroamazonas that calls for it to invest $1 billion over five years. A Halliburton spokeswoman on Tuesday declined to comment on its operations in the country.

366,SLB,"Weak crude oil stunts U.S. energy IPOs, boosts outlook for M&A;","LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The stream of U.S. energy companies going public at the start of 2017 has dried up on concerns over the future direction of oil prices, but private buyers seeking mergers and acquisitions are ready to take advantage of the volatility to secure cheap deals. Texas-based FTS International and Select Energy Services are among six U.S. energy companies that filed for listings in the first quarter but delayed, even after receiving the green light from local regulators, Thomson Reuters data showed. Four U.S. oil and gas companies went public in January, when more stable crude prices gave them confidence to tap into investor demand after a barren listings period that followed a slump in U.S. crude prices in late 2015. Share prices for that quartet tumbled 14 percent on average by March 31, according to Thomson Reuters data, as crude prices retreated to end the first quarter 6.5 percent lower, the biggest quarterly decline since late 2015. Two Canadian oilfield services firms, STEP Energy Services and Source Energy, pulled their March public offerings due to adverse market conditions, further undermining the case for energy IPOs. “There was talk of upwards of 20 IPOs getting ready to go at the start of the year, but now everyone is slowing down their processes as share prices have gone down as rapidly increasing production raised concerns about how fast and how far the recovery in oilfield activity would go,” said Brian Williams, managing director at Carl Marks Advisors. Most are in the oilfield services sector, with many looking to relist and raise fresh capital after going through bankruptcy proceedings during the last oil price downturn. With the sharp cost cutting by oil producers in the last 18 months continuing to hurt profits at service firms, companies that listed in 2017 often did so based on expected performance for coming years. Sliding crude prices in March undermined hopes for future growth. “The market was looking past current conditions to 2018 and 2019 projections with valuations of eight or nine times 2018 EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization), on the assumption that if you wanted to get in ahead of the future upside, you’d have to pay now,” said Williams. Bankers said that lower IPO valuations and lingering caution on oil prices would encourage energy companies to sell themselves to private buyers instead. Some are owned by distressed debt investors and hedge funds that bought them out of bankruptcy and could still secure a substantial profit even though valuations have declined in recent weeks. Such a switch in focus should not be too difficult. Many IPO processes have been run as dual-track, where concurrent attempts to list and sell the company are made by advisors. Private equity and similar investors seeking energy assets have adequate capital.  “In the current market, when the IPO valuations start to come down, if buyers are still optimistic, the sale proceeds might be more attractive to sellers than what they would get in an IPO,” said Jeffery Malonson, a capital markets partner at King & Spalding. He noted the owners would also secure the benefit of a full exit from their investment as opposed to a partial one through a listing. Companies could also use the delay in listing plans to bulk up their own operations using acquisitions, which will mean they have bigger and more valuable companies when they eventually go public. This is particularly true for oilfield services and equipment providers, which need to cut costs in the face of stalling cash flows and shrinking capex, bankers said. Improved scale was seen as one of the main drivers of Schlumberger NV’s agreement last month to form a $535 million joint venture with Weatherford International Plc to deliver oilfield products and services for unconventional resource plays in the United States and Canada. While some could fund deals with their own reserves, others will need to borrow cash. With banks likely reluctant to lend substantial sums to recently-restructured companies, private equity firms and other non-bank lenders could step in here as well. However, terms for borrowers would be more onerous than they would get at banks.

369,SLB,"RPT-ConocoPhillips takes slow, steady route in race for oil profits","(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text) By Gary McWilliams HOUSTON, April 20 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips has beaten its 2017 asset sales target less than four months into the year, after shedding $30.8 billion worth of energy assets in six years. But instead of a chorus of cheers on Wall Street, Chief Executive Ryan Lance is facing investor skepticism that the company can deliver growth from remaining oil and gas fields. ConocoPhillips' most recent sales of Canadian oil-sands properties and U.S. natural gas wells for a combined $16 billion will part with nearly 30 percent of its proved reserves in order to deliver near-term shareholder payouts and pare debt. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2pKHtZQ Lance told Reuters the sales to Cenovus Energy and Hilcorp Energy Co will fulfill promises to reduce long-term debt by 42 percent to $15 billion, fund $6 billion in share purchases and help reshape the company for an era of low and volatile energy prices. Drilling in two shale regions should help restore falling U.S. output by the fourth quarter. “I don’t worry about production and reserves in the company,” he told Reuters in an interview, citing oil and gas fields that could be upgraded to proved reserves over time. ConocoPhillips can achieve flat to 2 percent annual production growth on its properties, after adjustments for sales, and deliver shareholder payouts, he said. But interviews with portfolio managers, former employees and industry analysts point to the frequent sales as a short-term fix. They worry ConocoPhillips’ plan for modest production growth, flat capital spending and steady shareholder payouts pales in comparison to rivals that have retooled themselves to deliver sharply higher growth rates. The danger of its reliance on fewer assets was driven home in recent weeks as a fire at a supplier hurt its ability to ship crude from oil-sands properties. Mike Breard, who tracks energy stocks for Hodges Capital Management, said the strategy lacks appeal. “If I wanted yield, I’d buy something else. If I wanted growth, I buy something else. I just don’t see what customers would want to be in that in-between situation,” Breard said. The Houston company projects its daily production of crude and natural gas will fall 26 percent after the latest sales to about 1.16 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe). Barclays expects overall it won’t return to production growth on a full-year basis until 2019. “They’ve sold a very valuable asset,” said Marc Heilweil, senior portfolio manager at Atlanta-based investment firm Gratus Capital, referring to the oil-sands holdings. The deal will “make it harder for them to fully replace reserves down the line” because shale-oil properties have shorter productive lives, he said. To ensure growth, oil producers must continually add reserves to offset production and the natural decline that occurs in oil-and-gas properties. In 2012, ConocoPhillips spun off its refining business, leaving the ranks of the large, integrated companies like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, and putting it among a group of mostly-small U.S. independent exploration and production companies. Lance, who was the company’s technology chief, became ConocoPhillips’ chairman and CEO upon the spin off. He pledged to boost output by 3 percent to 5 percent annually by tapping its large pool of deep-water, oil-sands and conventional oil-and-gas properties. That goal ended two years later as prices collapsed, forcing it to borrow heavily to cover its spending on production. ConocoPhillips later cut its dividend. Its lack of exposure to refining has helped its shares stand out recently. The company’s stock is down 4.3 percent year to date, even after an about 9 percent jump following the March 29 disclosure of a $3 billion addition to its share buy backs. In contrast, Chevron is 11.5 percent lower and Exxon is off about 10.8 percent in the same period. Of analysts with published ratings on the stock, 7 rate it a strong buy, 11 rate it a buy and 6 rate it a hold. That compares to Chevron with 6 strong buy ratings, 12 buy ratings and 3 hold ratings. Last fall, Lance recast ConocoPhillips as an energy company able to offer steady shareholder returns on flat production spending of about $5 billion a year. It shaved its growth target to as much 2 percent, instead of up to 5 percent, and promised 20 percent to 30 percent of operating cash flow would go to holders via dividends and buy backs. He insists the remaining assets can generate substantial cash from operations even if oil falls below $40 a barrel. ConocoPhillips is ramping up output from its Eagle Ford and Bakken shale wells, from another oil-sands property and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from operations in Australia. Meanwhile, rivals have cranked up their production much faster. U.S. shale-focused companies project 15 percent volume growth this year, says consultancy Wood Mackenzie, and the larger oil producers such as Chevron are raising output and delivering fatter dividends. ConocoPhillips will be producing an average 1.25 million boe a day in 2019, estimates Barclays. In contrast, Chevron projects its daily output this year will rise between 103,000 boe and 233,000 boe over 2016’s average 2.59 million boe, excluding divestitures. Chevron pays a 4 percent dividend. The risk for ConocoPhillips investors is the growth in production doesn’t generate higher free cash flow for share buy backs, and the 2 percent dividend yield, about half that of Chevron, becomes the bigger part of returns. Henry Smith, co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, which invests in companies offering revenue growth and dividend gains, sold ConocoPhillips shares ahead of its 2016 dividend cut and has not been tempted back by the new strategy. ConocoPhillips’ pledge to deliver steady returns and growth is appealing, said Smith. But, he added: “Exxon over the years has fit that bill.” Haverford’s oil-industry holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron and Schlumberger NV, he said. Tom Bergeron, an equity analyst at Frost Bank, also prefers other oil producers such as Chevron and Occidental Petroleum Corp for what he said is their expected growth and their higher dividend yields. Lance, who worked summers as an oilfield roughneck while studying petroleum engineering in Montana, said he understands investors want proof the company can deliver regular payouts without the asset sales. “It’ll probably take performance through a cycle to demonstrate we have the position and the passion to deliver,” he said, referring to the industry’s boom and bust periods.

371,SLB,Schlumberger expects reactivation costs to squeeze margins,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) warned on Friday that margins would remain under pressure as the oilfield services provider spends more to bring back idled equipment to meet rising demand from North American shale producers after a two-year lull. Shares of the company, whose quarterly profit nearly halved due to a jump in costs, fell as much as 4.4 percent to $73.18, their lowest in nearly a year. Oilfield service providers, including Schlumberger’s rival Halliburton Co (HAL.N), are reviving equipment they stacked during the downturn in oil prices.    But bringing most oilfield fleets online comes at a cost, including expenses involved with repair and upkeep, and re-hiring of employees to man the equipment. “We will have some headwinds around one-time reactivation cost in the coming quarters,” Schlumberger’s Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said on a post-earnings conference call. The world’s No.1 oilfield services provider said its cost of revenue increased 11.3 percent to $6.08 billion in the quarter ended March 31, outpacing a 5.7 percent rise in revenue. The company’s pre-tax operating margin fell to 11 percent in the latest quarter, from 13.8 percent a year earlier. Schlumberger’s margin growth in the second and third quarters will be slower due to the reactivation costs, said James West, a partner at Evercore ISI. Still, Schlumberger expects its second-quarter earnings per share to increase 15-20 percent from the first, buoyed by strong North America demand. Revenue from North America surged 27.8 percent to $1.87 billion in latest quarter, while international revenue fell 1.1 percent to $4.92 billion.  “We expect another challenging year in international markets in 2017 before a clear acceleration of activity in 2018,” Kibsgaard said. Schlumberger said production constraints imposed on its project in Ecuador also impacted its latest quarter results as it struggles to collect $1.1 billion from Ecuador’s state-owned Petroamazonas. The company said on Friday it was willing to continue talks with Petroamazonas, but said it was not clear when the payment issues would be resolved. Schlumberger has invested $3 billion in Ecuador to-date under contracts signed earlier this decade to expand production at two oilfields. Net profit attributable to Schlumberger fell about 44 percent to $279 million, or 20 cents per share, in the first quarter. (bit.ly/2ox4Wg5) Excluding items, Schlumberger earned 25 cents per share, matching analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

380,SLB,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Ophir to borrow $1.2 bln from Chinese banks for Fortuna floating LNG,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - British oil and gas explorer Ophir Energy plans to borrow $1.2 billion from Chinese banks to back the development of its Fortuna floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) export project in Equatorial Guinea. The project is set to be cleared at the end of June, while the buyer of the LNG and the financial structure underpinning the scheme should be announced by the end of this month, Ophir Energy CEO Nick Cooper said on Monday. The choice of Chinese banks reflected the unwillingness of Western institutions to back African oil and gas projects, Cooper told Cooper an industry conference in Amsterdam..  “We’re close to closing that out,” he said in reference to the loan deals.  Fortuna FLNG will be Africa’s first deepwater floating liquefaction facility, with production capacity of 2.2 million tonnes per year and an estimated start-up in 2020.  Italian oil and gas group Eni  is advancing its own FLNG project, Coral, in waters off Mozambique.  Eni expects to approve the investment imminently after a breakthrough in convincing its Chinese partner, CNPC, which had previously withheld its blessing, to back the scheme, industry sources said. The two African FLNG projects are expected to be the only  multi-billion-dollar LNG projects to be given the go-ahead globally this year, as low oil and gas prices make companies rethink investment plans. Ophir’s Cooper said Fortuna FLNG was highly competitive against rival producers, which have heavier capital investments, allowing it to deliver supply to Europe more cheaply than even new projects in the United States.  While Ophir has not announced the identity of the buyer of output from its facility, industry sources have said the majority of interest has come from European players, including utilities.  Shipping company Golar LNG, also a partner in Fortuna FLNG with oil services firm Schlumberger via a joint venture, will build, own and deliver the FLNG vessel, which is called the Gandria.  The Gandria is an LNG tanker which Golar is fitting out with liquefaction technology.  Conversions like these are highly price competitive against traditional and more costly onshore liquefaction plants, said Chris Holmes, managing director of gas and LNG at IHS. Malaysia’s Petronas brought on stream the world’s first FLNG project this year, called PFLNG 1. On the other end of the spectrum, the world’s biggest FLNG project, the giant Prelude plant being specially built by Royal Dutch Shell for deployment off the coast of Australia, staggers in at a cost of $12 billion. It is due to start next year. By the end of the decade, 14 million tonnes of FLNG production is expected to come online, Holmes said.

382,SLB,Ecuador eyes payment deal with Schlumberger soon,"QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador wants to negotiate a payment plan with oil service companies owed more than $2 billion and expects to begin talks with main creditor Schlumberger in coming days, its new oil minister told Reuters on Wednesday. Ecuador’s economy has struggled since the 2014 collapse of oil prices and a devastating earthquake last year that killed some 670 people and cost an estimated $3 billion. The smallest member of OPEC has built up debts for oilfield services that Schlumberger, which is owed about $1 billion, has described as causing “considerable financial stress.” Oil Minister Carlos Perez, a former Halliburton executive named by new President Lenin Moreno this month, expressed confidence the situation would be resolved.  “In the case of Schlumberger it is a holistic conversation, in which we will review rates, part of the debt with them, and additional investments,” he said in an interview in his office in the mountainous capital Quito. Perez said the conversations would probably start this week. “We have to reach payment agreements with companies, be it with (central bank notes) or other types of bonds, and another part in cash,” he said.  Ecuador last month gave Schlumberger $150 million in central bank notes that can be used to pay taxes, as part of efforts to pay down its debt with the company. Ecuador also has debts with Halliburton, Sinopec and smaller local providers, Perez said. A Schlumberger spokesperson said the company was optimistic about the Moreno government and open to negotiation of contracts but that it expected proof that debt that has accumulated over 22 months will be paid. The Andean country also wants to propose a broad renegotiation of contracts with service companies, based on international crude prices, to stimulate investment, Perez said. “One of the things we’re trying to include is indexing the contracts to the WTI prices,” he said. Perez also expects oil production in Ecuador to ramp up to about 700,000 barrels per day, up from around 535,000 bpd currently, in the next four years. He cautioned that would depend on the scale of investments. ",5312017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecuador-oil/ecuador-eyes-payment-deal-with-schlumberger-soon-idUSKBN18R30N

388,SLB,Schlumberger beats on North American drilling; sees global recovery,"(Reuters) - Top oilfield services provider Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) said on Friday it would redeploy all of its pressure pumping fleet by early next quarter as demand rises in North America and most of its international markets. North American shale producers have ramped up drilling in recent quarters as oil prices bounced back from their lows in 2016, when they hit about $27 per barrel. Crude in the second quarter averaged $48.15 per barrel, and companies added 506 onshore rigs in the past year, according to a closely watched Baker Hughes report. Schlumberger and rivals such as Halliburton (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes GE Co (BHGE.N), which help explorers locate oil and prepare drill-wells, are bringing back equipment they stacked during the downturn. Houston-based Schlumberger said on Friday that North American revenue jumped 18 percent and international revenue rose 4 percent in the latest quarter from the preceding. Chief Executive Paul Kibsgaard said on an earnings call he was “somewhat positively surprised” in terms of activity in international markets. “The market has viewed international with the expectation that it will be weak until oil gets up to the $50-$60,” said Brian Youngberg, an energy analyst with Edward Jones.  “The comment that there are signs of life below $50 (oil)could be positive.”    To tap the improving demand in international markets, Schlumberger said it would buy a majority stake in Russia’s biggest oilfield services firm, Eurasia Drilling Co (EDC). “The purchase of the Eurasia group is sort of a bet that international markets are going to keep advancing,” said Stewart Glickman, energy equity analyst at CFRA Research in New York.  U.S. onshore revenue soared 42 percent in the latest quarter from the preceding, as fracking revenue was boosted by companies completing more wells and better pricing. “We expect U.S. land activity to remain strong throughout the second half of the year, with a frac calendar already fully booked well into Q4,” said Patrick Schorn, executive vice president of new ventures at Schlumberger. Total revenue rose 4.2 percent to $7.46 billion in the second quarter, beating the average analysts’ estimate of $7.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 35 cents per share, handily beating expectation of 30 cents. The company’s shares rose as much as 3 percent to $68.96,  before paring some gains. Gains were limited by a fall in oil prices that dragged down the broader energy index.

390,SLB,UPDATE 2-Schlumberger buys Eurasia Drilling stake in test of Russia-U.S. ties,"(Adds Kremlin comments, details, context) By Polina Devitt MOSCOW, July 21 (Reuters) - U.S. oilfield services giant Schlumberger NV has agreed to buy a 51 percent stake in Russian peer Eurasia Drilling Co (EDC) in a deal likely to test Russia-U.S. ties. The deal marks Schlumberger’s second attempt to buy into EDC and the first U.S. stake in Russia’s oil and gas sector since sanctions were imposed on Moscow after its 2014 annexation of Crimea. “I warmly welcome Schlumberger as our majority shareholder. It builds on our strategic alliance with Schlumberger since 2011 and our mutually beneficial business relationship since 2007,” EDC Chief Executive Alexander Djaparidze said in a statement late on Thursday. In 2015, Schlumberger agreed to buy 45.65 percent of EDC for $1.7 billion but the deal fell through after Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service repeatedly postponed its approval. That deal met with resistance in Russia’s higher echelons of power who were worried that Schlumberger might seize control of Eurasia, a senior government official said in 2015. EDC then delisted its shares on the London Stock Exchange. The Kremlin declined to say whether Russian authorities had since warmed to the U.S. investor. “If we talk about a global trend, Russia was, is and will be interested in foreign investment and in cooperation with foreign investors in all possible sectors, excluding the areas which are most sensitive,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. “But even in these areas cooperation is still possible, and a relevant decision is to be taken in each separate case by the government’s commission on foreign investment.” For Schlumberger, the investment would mean access to the Russian market where producers have sustained their capital spending despite low oil prices. U.S. oilfield service companies have been supported by their operations in North America, where expanding shale production is driving revenue, but their international and offshore operations continue to be pressured by weak oil prices. The Schlumberger agreement is also subject to approval by Russia’s antitrust body, EDC said. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. “Work on this investment remains ongoing and the company expects to enter into a definitive agreement in relation to it in the near future,” EDC said. Xenon Capital acted as financial adviser to EDC, a source close to the deal told Reuters. In June, state-backed Russian Direct Investment Fund said it was buying a minority stake in Eurasia Drilling via a consortium with Chinese and UAE funds.

392,SLB,"Halliburton, Schlumberger take hit on Venezuela bills in second quarter"," ((This July 25 story corrects to indicate majority of the impairment charged was related to PdVSA’s promissory notes, not all of the charge, in second paragraph)) By Liz Hampton HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela was unable to pay its biggest oilfield suppliers in cash in the second quarter, and top service companies Halliburton and Schlumberger accepted promissory notes that they immediately wrote down by hundreds of millions of dollars, their second-quarter reports showed.   Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield service firm by revenue, took a $510 million impairment charge, the vast majority of which was on promissory notes received from Petroleos de Venezuela SA [PDVSAC.UL] in lieu of $700 million in outstanding fees.  Halliburton similarly recorded a pre-tax charge of $262 million on promissory notes from its main customer in Venezuela in exchange for $375 million in fees, according to its financial filing.  Neither company identified PDVSA by name, and both described the oil company as their “primary customer” in Venezuela. A PDVSA source confirmed it issued the notes.  Foreign oil companies operating in Venezuela have become increasingly exposed to that country’s economic woes, which have worsened under socialist President Nicolas Maduro. A brutal recession and persistent low oil prices have the cash-strapped nation delaying payments or using government-issued notes to pay suppliers. Last month, Weatherford International plc said it would amend its financial statements to reclassify $31 million that was previously booked as revenue as interest payment and a reduction in accounts receivable because of PDVSA’s lengthy delay in payment.   Representatives from Halliburton and Weatherford did not immediately respond to requests for comments. Schlumberger referred questions on the impairment charge to its coming financial filings. Such problems have not stopped smaller firms for signing up for work in the country. Oklahoma-based Horizontal Well Drillers on Tuesday said it signed a memorandum of understanding to explore new drilling jobs for PDVSA in Venezuela.  Last year, the company, Schlumberger and Venezuelan contractor Y&V; agreed to drill a combined 480 wells for projects operated by PDVSA and its foreign partners, but that project has not yet started. The United States has been weighing financial sanctions against Venezuela that could halt dollar payments for its oil, Reuters reported last week, a move to pressure Maduro into halting plans for a new Constituent Assembly that would give him unchecked power.  If sanctions were to pass, payments to oilfield service firms could become even more challenging.

On Aug. 2, U.S. President Donald Trump grudgingly signed into law new sanctions against Russia, a move Moscow said amounted to a full-scale trade war and an end to hopes for better ties with the Trump administration. Schlumberger needs a special approval by the U.S. Treasury, Artemyev said. “Do you believe the U.S. Treasury will issue such an approval in the current situation?” The deal marks Schlumberger’s second attempt to buy into EDC and the first U.S. stake in Russia’s oil and gas industry since sanctions were imposed on Moscow after its 2014 annexation of Crimea. In 2015 Schlumberger agreed to buy 45.65 percent of EDC for $1.7 billion but the deal fell through after FAS repeatedly postponed its approval. That deal met with resistance in Russia where there were worries that Schlumberger might seize control of EDC, a senior government official said in 2015. EDC then delisted its shares on the London Stock Exchange. “Nothing has changed since that time, plus (Russia’s) Natural Resources Ministry has taken a tough stance. There are many different and not too good (things) happening in (the) relationship for this deal,” Artemyev added. Russia’s Natural Resources Ministry said in early August that Russia should impose “limits” on the American company in this deal because the industry was of strategic importance for Russia. Artemyev said that Russia would give consideration to the deal but U.S. Treasury approval was still needed.

403,SLB,"BP, Shell tie future to North Sea despite broad retreat","ABERDEEN, Scotland (Reuters) - Two of the most veteran oil and gas producers in the UK North Sea, Royal Dutch Shell and BP, still tie their future to the ageing offshore basin despite a broad retreat in recent years. Both companies plan to explore this year for new resources in the North Sea, one of the oldest deepwater hubs faced with harsh weather conditions, executives told Reuters. The two oil giants have sold billions worth of North Sea fields, many of them nearing the end of their life, in recent years. But still they see golden opportunities there as new technologies open up resources that can be profitable with oil trading at around $50 a barrel and in some cases lower. “We like the North Sea. It has been an important hub for us for a long time and it will remain one,” BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley said on the sidelines of the Offshore Europe conference in Aberdeen, Scotland, from where many companies hold their North Sea operations. “This year we will be drilling six exploration wells in the UK North Sea. That’s more than we drilled in decades.” In another sign of confidence, France’s Total last month acquired Maersk Oil, which will see it leapfrog Shell and BP to become the second-largest North Sea producer after Norway’s Statoil. The parallel investments and retreat in the North Sea come as the basin prepares to dismantle dozens of platforms and plug hundreds of depleted wells that will cost operators including BP and Shell more than $60 billion by 2050. The North Sea became a major offshore hub in the 1970s. Although its production peaked in the late 1990s, it has staged a modest recovery since 2015.  It is believed to hold an additional 20 billion barrels, according to the British government.  Despite harsh weather and often high costs, the North Sea offers a stable tax regime and guaranteed payments as its oil is sold in industrialized countries with high investment ratings and no military conflicts. BP, together with Shell and Siccar Point, started production in 2017 at one of the largest projects launched in the region in years, the Quad 204 field in the west Shetlands.  BP plans to launch another field, Clair Ridge, next year, with the aim of doubling production by 2020 to 200,000 barrels of oil and gas equivalent per day (boed). At the same time, BP has sold a number of ageing fields, pipelines and terminals in recent years. Shell’s oil and gas production in the North Sea is set to fall by around 40 percent to 150,000 boed after the planned completion this year of the $3.8 billion sale of a large number of fields and assets to private-equity-backed Chrysaor. But Shell vowed to remain a key player in the North Sea and invest hundreds of millions of dollars there. “Shell very much plans to be part of that future,” Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said of the North Sea. The Anglo-Dutch company plans to drill three to five exploration wells in the North Sea this year, according to Shell’s UK Chair Sinead Lynch and Steve Phimister, director of its UK oil and gas production, known as upstream. Shell also aims to maintain stable production of 150,000 boed into 2030, which will require an annual investment of between $600 million and $1 billion dollars, they said. The North Sea was severely hit by a three-year drop in oil prices, with drilling activity falling to levels not seen since the 1970s, according to Catherine MacGregor, drilling group president at services provider Schlumberger. But operators rose to the challenge, sharply reducing operating costs and introducing efficiencies that were lost throughout the rally in oil prices to above $100 a barrel in the first half of the decade. Operating costs in the North Sea have halved since 2014 to an average of around $15 per barrel, BP’s Dudley said. “The margin on the barrel in the North Sea is so strong it asks for you to come to invest in the basin to maintain production levels,” Phimister said.

404,SLB,RPT-INSIGHT-The next oil major? Service firm Schlumberger's big bet on production,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Liz Hampton HOUSTON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The world’s largest oilfield services company, Schlumberger NV, is spending billions of dollars buying stakes in its customers’ oil and gas projects - investing in the same ventures it supplies with equipment and expertise. The new business model gives Schlumberger a say in drilling decisions, oilfield management and even on hiring other Schlumberger units for service contracts, the company has told investors. The expanded operational authority saves Schlumberger from bidding for each of the many jobs that typically require separate contracts on a large drilling project - effectively locking out the firm’s competitors. Schlumberger’s gamble could upend the service business model throughout the industry, as rivals including General Electric Co’s unit Baker Hughes say they are considering whether to adopt similar strategies. The model can supercharge profits on a given job but also ramps up risk, giving the firm more exposure to global oil price swings and potentially big losses if individual projects fail. The downsides have some analysts questioning whether the traditionally conservative firm is taking on too many speculative projects too quickly. Schlumberger already has taken hundreds of millions in write-downs or impairments on some of these joint ventures, according to its financial filings. Traditionally, oil producers manage the risk and make the financial and operational decisions on projects; they pay service providers a fee to carry out individual jobs. Firms such as Schlumberger typically supply a wide variety of services, such as well design, along with technology and staff to run rigs. Schlumberger declined to make executives available for interviews and did not respond to written questions about its production business. Despite early setbacks, Schlumberger has committed cash to growing the division, called Schlumberger Production Management, since its launch in 2011. Last year, it generated $1.4 billion in revenue. It had investment of $2.6 billion as of June 30, Schlumberger Executive Vice President Patrick Schorn told investors earlier this summer. The company’s investments have the firm co-managing about 230,000 barrels a day of oil and gas output at the end of 2016 - about as much as one of the largest U.S. independent producers, Pioneer Natural Resources. This year, the company stepped up the financing role, opening a standalone investment fund to provide financing for the ventures. The company has not disclosed the size of the fund. Such ventures require a breadth of skills and a tolerance for risk generally found at large integrated oil companies such as Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp. Two of Schlumberger’s newest partnerships - a deepwater liquefied natural gas project off the coast of Equatorial Guinea and an Argentina shale development with YPF SA - involve decision-making and operational authority similar to that typically held by multinational oil producers. In June, Schlumberger agreed to invest $700 million in an oil exploration project with Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (IPO-NNP.LG) and First Exploration & Production that would require global oil prices of between $50 to $60 a barrel to achieve a 20 percent profit, research house Bernstein estimated in a report published in July. Current prices are struggling to break out of the bottom of that range. As Schlumberger’s production business has grown, it has negotiated deals that include equity in oil and gas fields and as well as deals that give the firm payment based on oil and gas output, according to interviews with customers, partners, investors and former Schlumberger executives. Schlumberger this year agreed to contribute $390 million for a 49 percent stake in a venture with YPF in Argentina’s Vaca Muerta shale field, which has attracted international oil firms including Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell. Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard has downplayed the potential for its production business to compete with its own oil company customers. He described the enterprise as “a new avenue for project investments alongside our customers” in remarks to investors in April. Schorn also insisted this spring that the business is “not significantly changing the risk profile ... the biggest risk remains the cyclical nature” of the oil and gas industry. Investors say Schlumberger, which held $6.22 billion in cash and short-term investments at June 30, is strong enough to handle any increased risks and the price volatility of its investments in long-term projects. As both project manager and service provider, Schlumberger also has an enviable level of control over operations, said Mike Breard of Dallas-based wealth management firm Hodges Capital, which invests in oilfield service companies. “I like the long-term aspect of it – the fact that they are telling frack crews where to work, and using their own equipment more efficiently than might be used by some other operator,” he said. British-based natural gas explorer Sound Energy PLC was happy to give Schlumberger full rights to the service contracts on drilling projects in Morocco in exchange for a Schlumberger investment amounting to 27 percent of total costs, said the chief of British-based natural gas explorer. Schlumberger will get 27.5 percent of revenue from the oil produced. “We’re smaller and entrepreneurial. Schlumberger has the technical capability and cash. That’s the nature of the partnership,” Sound CEO James Parsons said in an interview. The duo has completed three wells in Morocco and plans to drill three more by year end. “It’s a $50 or $60 million bet for them so far,” Parsons said. Schlumberger’s appetite for these ventures is spurring rivals to consider similar financing and services deals. Baker Hughes recently agreed to provide about $10 million in financing to Twinza Oil’s first offshore gas field in Papua New Guinea, supplying the cash to prove the merits of the field. “It allows Twinza to have success in going out to raise financing,” Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said. Baker Hughes will not take a stake in the oilfield, unlike some of Schlumberger’s joint investments with producers. In 2014 and 2015, Schlumberger took nearly $400 million in combined write-offs on oil production investments, including an Eagle Ford shale field in south Texas that struggled after oil prices crashed. It also is owed about $900 million by Ecuador. In July, the South American country said it had negotiated a payment plan that includes an expanded contract that has Schlumberger agreeing to invest another $1 billion in the venture. Schlumberger hasn’t commented on the South American nation’s disclosure. It previously acknowledged taking Ecuadorian bonds in lieu of cash for $150 million in bills. It also previously estimated its investment in the projects at up to $4.9 billion over 20 years. The write downs have stirred some on Wall Street to question whether Schlumberger should take more conservative path with its oil production partnerships. The firm’s production division “used to focus on production management of well understood low-risk oil fields,” said Colin Davies, a Bernstein oilfield services analyst. “Now it has expanded into frankly somewhat more speculative ventures.” ",9082017,http://www.reuters.com/article/schlumberger-oil-production/rpt-insight-the-next-oil-major-service-firm-schlumbergers-big-bet-on-production-idUSL2N1LO2F9

409,SLB,Ecuador's Petroamazonas to issue $350 mln bonds to help pay Schlumberger debt,"QUITO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Ecuador’s state oil company Petroamazonas said it will issue some $350 million in bonds to repay part of its debts with oil services company Schlumberger as part of a wider deal that also includes other payment decisions. Petroamazonas accumulated debt with foreign suppliers as of 2015 in part due to lower oil prices. The company owes Schlumberger some $850 million. “An agreement with Schlumberger was reached last week for the payment of the total debt ... In November we will issue bonds for $350 million,” Alex Galarraga, Petroamazonas’ boss told reporters during a visit to the country’s oil bloc known as ITT on Wednesday. “Petroamazonas will issue bonds and several buyers will acquire the paper, and through Citibank the money will be delivered to Schlumberger,” he added. Schlumberger did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The agreement also includes payment of $250 million in monthly installments as of next January for two years, at an interest rate of around 4 percent. The remainder of the debt will be covered in cash and in central bank notes, known by the Spanish acronym TBC. Ecuador recently negotiated a new fee for service with Schlumberger in an oilfield in the jungle.

410,SLB,UPDATE 3-Schlumberger's latest asset deal raises fresh concerns ahead of Q3,"(Rewrites throughout to add deal’s impact on Schlumberger) By Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Karan Nagarkatti Oct 19 (Reuters) - Oilfield services giant Schlumberger Ltd sealed a deal to buy oil and gas assets worth $1 billion from Cenovus Energy on Thursday, raising further concerns about its strategy to own more refining and drilling operations directly. For Calgary, Alberta-based Cenovus, the sale is the latest in its plan to offload assets as it pays down debt, including loans it took up to fund its $13.3 billion purchase of oil sands and natural gas assets from ConocoPhillips. Cenovus’s shares were up about 2 percent in afternoon trading, while Schlumberger’s were down about 1.5 percent, along with other energy stocks due to lower crude oil prices. To diversify from its core services business, Schlumberger has poured billions of dollars – about $4.3 billion since 2012, according to Barclays – into buying stakes in oil and gas projects through its Schlumberger Project Management (SPM) unit. Schlumberger hopes the strategy will add to its profit, but investors worry it also exposes the company to global oil price swings and big losses if some projects fail. “The debate is how much (the Cenovus deal) truly diversifies risk as acquiring E&P; assets implies taking on additional commodity risk, while international projects incur increased country risk,” Barclays said. SPM will be the majority non-operating owner and services provider for the Palliser oil and natural gas assets in southeastern Alberta, which will be operated by Torxen Energy, a private exploration firm led by former Cenovus executive John Brannan. The oil-focused development plan includes a multi-year program to drill more than 1,600 oil wells starting in 2018, the companies said, adding the sale will close this quarter. “Investors have been asking a lot of questions about Schlumberger’s SPM strategy, fearing the business adds uncertain risk to the company’s earnings,” analyst Marc Bianchi at Cowen and Co said. “As a majority non-op owner, it appears Schlumberger is taking commodity risk on this project,” he said.

411,SLB,Top oilfield services firms signal fourth-quarter uncertainty,"(Reuters) - The world’s top two oilfield service firms on Friday warned slower producer spending and weakness in offshore exploration may weigh on current-quarter earnings, but said activity could improve in the longer term as the global crude market comes into balance.   The outlook drove shares in both companies lower, with Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) hitting a 21-month low and Baker Hughes (BHGE.N) touching a 16-month low before retracing some losses.  Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield service company, warned that Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter earnings may be too high, with customer investments in North American production moderating due to investor pressure for improved shareholder returns.  But global oil supply and demand is becoming more balanced and recent spending cutbacks on U.S. production could eventually boost crude prices, Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said.  A current lack of production investments outside North America should benefit producers as inventories fall, Kibsgaard  said.  Baker Hughes’ CEO Lorenzo Simonelli was more pessimistic,  saying the oilfield services industry continues to be volatile and describing the business environment as “challenging” with customers pushing out some equipment purchases. “We have seen some improvement in activity but we have not seen meaningful increases in customer capital commitments,” he said.  Schlumberger was last down 3.3 percent at $62.33 and Baker Hughes off less than 1 percent at $33.08.  U.S. oil producers are under pressure to boost shareholder returns after ramping up spending earlier this year while oil prices remained flat, knocking share prices back after a sharp run up in 2016.  Brent crude prices LCOc1 have barely budged this year and the U.S. crude benchmark CLc.1 has remained mostly below $55 a barrel.  This summer, U.S. producers Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N), ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Hess Corp (HES.N) cut second-half capital spending plans, including on oilfield services activities. Crude’s sub-$60 prices have also weighed on offshore exploration and driven a fresh round of consolidation among those drillers in a bid to tame excess capacity. “In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, activity continued to weaken in the third quarter, and the outlook remains bleak for this region based on current customer plans,” Schlumberger’s Kibsgaard said.  Baker Hughes, in its first report to include GE Co’s (GE.N) oil and gas business since their merger, reported a third-quarter profit that missed analysts estimates by a wide margin. Schlumberger, however, matched analysts’ profit estimates and posted a 43 percent jump in business from North America.

Larger rival Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) also warned on Friday that oil and gas companies’ investments in North America were moderating. “Oil prices remain volatile and, as a result, our customers remain cautious,” Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of Baker Hughes, the world’s No. 2 oilfield services firm, said. A week back, Baker Hughes said U.S. oil rig count, an early indicator of future output, had been falling for the past two months amid a perception of lower-for-longer oil prices. [RIG/U] Brent crude LCOc1 prices are currently $56.97 per barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 prices are $50.95. But, nearly two-thirds of U.S. energy firm’s executives expect crude prices to stay below $60 per barrel through 2018 and not hit $70 at least until the next decade. Baker Hughes reported a third-quarter loss of $104 million, or 24 cents per share. It did not give a comparable year-ago number in its first report to include GE Co’s (GE.N) oil and gas business. Excluding items, the company earned 5 cents per share, far lower than analysts average estimate of 11 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Including GE’s energy business, Baker Hughes’ revenue was flat at $5.38 billion, the company said.

The smallest member of OPEC earlier this year reported a debt of $850 million with Schlumberger that it had promised to pay down in separate disbursements.  Petroamazonas said it had paid down $550 million since July, and that the deal to be signed in late November would clear its debt with Schlumberger. “At the end of November, an agreement will be signed to complete a $300 million payment, which will complete 100 percent of the value owed,” the ministry said in the statement.

Trading volumes were thin ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday and an early close on Friday, but investors will scrutinize the minutes for Fed’s thinking on inflation for more clarity on what it might do under a new chair next year. A final quarter-point rise under Janet Yellen next month is almost fully baked in to short-term interest rates, underlining the Fed’s continuing optimism about the economy. But the pace of rises is also slow enough not to scare stock investors who have thrived on a decade of cheap money. “On this eve of Thanksgiving, the market is attempting to maintain an upward bias with oil prices and the macro news leading the way,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, wrote in a note. “We look for a fairly mixed to positive session.” At 8:28 a.m. ET (1228 GMT), Dow e-minis were up 40 points, or 0.17 percent, with 22,222 contracts changing hands. S&P; 500 e-minis gained 2.5 points, or 0.1 percent, on 130,840 contracts traded while Nasdaq 100 e-minis rose 9 points, or 0.14 percent, on volume of 27,045 contracts. All of Wall Street’s main indexes closed at record levels on Tuesday after a bounce in technology stocks, by far the best performing sector of the market this year. One blip in that area was the 6-percent drop in Hewlett Packard Enterprise shares in premarket after Chief Executive Meg Whitman said she would leave in February six years into the job. HP Inc, comprising the computer and printer business that Whitman carved out of the old Hewlett Packard, was also down 4.7 percent after reporting an unimpressive profit. U.S. light crude jumped nearly 2 percent on Wednesday, hitting $58 a barrel for the first time since July 2015 as a major pipeline cut Canadian deliveries to the United States, where inventories are already said to be falling. Oil majors Chevron and Exxon both rose half a percent and sector services provider Schlumberger gained 1 percent. One other big gainer was U.S. tractor maker Deere & Co which rose about 5 percent after reporting upbeat quarterly earnings and issuing a strong profit forecast for the year.

Weatherford has struggled with losses and has been looking to sell units and raise cash to reduce about $7.9 billion in debt. It suffered a $875 million loss on $4.21 billion in revenue for the first nine months of this year.   In March, the company agreed to put its North American pressure pumping and well completions operations into a venture with Schlumberger in exchange for $535 million in cash and a 30 percent stake in the resulting business, called OneStim. The effort was designed to better compete against market leader Halliburton and fast-growing companies such as Keane Group.  On Friday, the joint venture was abruptly called off as Weatherford sold its U.S. pressure pumping assets used to hydraulically fracture shale rock to release trapped oil and gas, and transferred about 100 employees to Schlumberger. The new deal “delivers cash proceeds that enable our company to begin the deleveraging process,” Weatherford Chief Executive Mark McCollum said in a statement. Keeping the U.S. and Canadian well-completions operation “allows for significant upside potential,” he added.  Pressure pumping specialists have been expanding rapidly with strong demand from shale producers taking advantage of higher crude prices. This month, Keane Group Inc (FRAC.N) said it would spend $115 million to expand its fleet, citing higher demand and improved economics.  RBC Capital Markets analyst Kurt Hallead in a research note said the deal doubles Schlumberger’s hydraulic fracturing fleet and allows it to avoid a potential payout to acquire the rest of OneStim. Weatherford gets most of the cash it would have received under the original agreement, but gives up recurring income from the joint venture, he wrote.  Representatives of Weatherford and Schlumberger did not reply to requests for comment.  Weatherford shares closed up 13 cents to $4.17 on Friday.

RBC Capital Markets analyst Kurt Hallead in a research note said the deal doubles Schlumberger’s hydraulic fracturing fleet and allows it to avoid a potential payout to acquire the rest of OneStim. Weatherford gets most of the cash it would have received under the original agreement, but gives up recurring income from the joint venture, he wrote.  Representatives of Weatherford and Schlumberger did not reply to requests for comment.  Weatherford shares closed up 13 cents to $4.17 on Friday. They are off about 36 percent since March, when the joint venture was first proposed. Schlumberger was off 7 cents at $67.39.

427,SLB,Weatherford shares plummet after company scraps OneStim venture,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shares of Weatherford International Plc (WFT.N) fell 18 percent on Tuesday after the oilfield services company  abandoned a proposed joint venture with Schlumberger (SLB.N) and instead sold its hydraulic fracturing business to Schlumberger, a bigger rival. The deal with Schlumberger, worth $430 million, gave Weatherford roughly $100 million less than originally anticipated from the two companies’ planned OneStim joint venture.  Weatherford has suffered steep losses since the 2014 oil price downturn and has said it plans to sell units to raise cash and reduce its $7.9 billion in debt.     The lower value of the deal, coupled with the loss of potential income from the joint venture in the booming pressure pumping market, drew a negative reaction from investors on the first day of trading since the sale was announced.  In mid-afternoon trade, Weatherford’s shares were down 75 cents at $3.40. Shares of Schlumberger were up about 3 percent at $69.48. “Early feedback from the buy side (energy hedge funds, predominantly) purports that this is a negative outcome for WFT (Weatherford), in that it is receiving less cash than originally contemplated, and is releasing the additional upside in its frac business had the JV been finalized,” according to a research note from investment bank Simmons & Co.   Pressure pumping and completions businesses have been a bright spot for U.S. oilfield services companies still recovering from the crash in oil prices. Fully booked equipment and crews have, for example, sent shares of Keane Group (FRAC.N), a smaller competitor, almost 37 percent higher since early December.  Some analysts said the sales price was reasonable based on the assets Schlumberger acquired. “We understand around half of the Weatherford equipment is older and deeply stacked and will require refurbishment to make field ready,” wrote analysts from Sanford C Bernstein in a note on Tuesday. They added that some of the lower quality equipment may not come back.  Weatherford would have taken a 30 percent stake in OneStim, which was expected to contribute to the its earnings.  “There was a scenario whereby Weatherford may have been in a position to monetize its 30 percent stake,” said Byron Pope, a managing director in Tudor Pickering Holt’s equity research division.  ""There would have been precedent for Schlumberger wanting to own 100 percent of the joint venture,"" he added, pointing to Schlumberger's acquisition of Cameron's ownership stake in their OneSubsea joint venture in 2016.

430,SLB,U.S. Supreme Court to hear Schlumberger fight over patent damages,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to review a bid by Schlumberger NV, the world’s largest oilfield services provider, to allow companies to recoup profits lost due to patent infringement when patented technology is used overseas. The case involves a fight over how much rival ION Geophysical Corp must pay for infringing Schlumberger technology that helps search for oil and gas beneath the ocean floor. The justices will hear Schlumberger’s appeal of a lower court ruling that barred it from recovering more than $93 million stemming from foreign contracts the company said it lost as a result of the infringement.  The case involves four patents owned by Schlumberger subsidiary WesternGeco related to an invention that more efficiently completes marine seismic surveys to help identify oil and gas drilling locations.  ION developed a competing system and sold it to surveying companies abroad. WesternGeco sued in 2009, and a federal jury in Houston, where both firms are based, found that Ion infringed the patents and caused the company to lose contracts. The jury awarded $12.5 million in royalties and $93.4 million in lost profits.  In 2015, the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent disputes, ruled that Schlumberger could not recoup the lost profits portion, saying U.S. patent law does not apply outside the country. Schlumberger appealed to the Supreme Court. The company said the ruling will harm innovation by allowing companies to infringe competitors’ patents while risking minimal punishment. President Donald Trump’s administration, backing Schlumberger, urged the court to take the case.  The court is likely to decide the case by the end of June, when its current term ends.

433,SLB,"Schlumberger profit beats, sees stronger year for oil sector","HOUSTON (Reuters) - Schlumberger (SLB.N) on Friday posted a fourth quarter loss on charges but beat Wall Street forecasts and gave an upbeat outlook, predicting its international operations would grow in 2018 for the first time in four years.    Schlumberger, the largest energy company so far to report results, is a bellwether for oilfield services and drilling. Its forecast for broad improvements this year on higher oil prices signals a stronger recovery for producers and service companies.  “Looking at the oil market, the strong growth in demand is projected to continue in 2018, on the back of a robust global economy,” said Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard. Producers predict between 15 and 20 percent growth in North American energy investments, he said.  The world’s largest oilfield services company reported $2.7 billion in fourth quarter charges including a $938 million write-down of its Venezuelan holdings and unpaid bills due to economic turmoil there. Schlumberger said it would remain in the South American country and continue to seek payment for its past work there.     It also took more than $1.1 billion in restructuring expenses tied to its WesternGeco seismic business, citing poor returns. That unit will focus on selling its seismic data and no longer provide land and marine seismic acquisition. The business has suffered as drilling has focused on well-defined U.S. shale fields rather than new areas.  The charges widened Schlumberger’s fourth quarter net loss to $2.26 billion, from $204 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 15 percent to $8.18 billion.  Its shares were roughly flat at $76.33 in afternoon trade. Excluding the writedowns, profit benefited from the year’s recovery in crude prices, rising to 48 cents a share, above the average analyst estimate of 44 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Schlumberger said quarterly results included an additional $76 million in taxes due to U.S. tax reform.  The company saw international growth underpinned by recent contract wins in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, India and elsewhere.  “The international market will return to growth for the first time since 2014,” Patrick Schorn, executive vice president for new ventures, said during an earnings call. “Projected activity growth is leading us to start the reactivation of equipment,” he added.  Growth in the international market has been supported by a nearly 24 percent climb in the global Brent futures contract LCOc1 in the past three months. In North America, where fourth quarter revenue rose 59 percent over a year earlier, Schlumberger said it expected to deploy new hydraulic fracturing fleets due to strong demand for pressure pumping services. The company in January acquired Weatherford International’s (WFT.N) hydraulic fracturing business, scrapping plans for a joint venture. The recovery of global oil prices to almost $70 a barrel has given fresh legs to shale drilling in North America, positioning the United States to push oil output past 10 million barrels per day - toppling a record set in 1970.  Schlumberger also said it would move into “execution” mode to focus on generating positive cash flow for its Schlumberger Production Management (SPM) business, which invests in major oilfield projects alongside customers. “I would characterize this as very disciplined growth going forward,” said Schorn, regarding the company’s strategy for the business, which has drawn investor attention because of heavy investments.  For the full year, Schlumberger reported a net loss of $1.51 billion, down from $1.69 billion in 2016. Revenue rose 9.5 percent to $30.44 billion.

440,SLB,Egypt says signs seismic survey deal with Schlumberger,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt has signed a deal with oilfield services company Schlumberger to conduct a seismic survey in the Gulf of Suez, the oil ministry said on Wednesday, part of efforts to encourage firms to invest in exploration work in the area. The oil ministry announced an agreement with an international company on Monday to conduct a seismic survey of the Gulf of Suez to attract exploration investment, but did not identify the company and gave no details. The deal, signed on the sidelines of an energy conference in Cairo, allows Schlumberger to start work on the survey. The ministry did not give the value of the deal. Egypt has been on a drive to attract more investment in its energy sector and speed up production at recent discoveries in order to become gas self-sufficient by the end of 2018. “The region is still full of promising petroleum prospects that require further work and studies to re-discover the gulf’s petroleum reservoirs and those that have not yet been discovered,” Egyptian petroleum minister Tarek El Molla said in a statement. Molla also oversaw the signing of another agreement with Schlumberger that included a data center on areas open for exploration in Egypt, also part of the country’s efforts to make it easier for foreign companies to invest in exploration work. Egypt last year began production at its mammoth offshore Zohr gas field in the Mediterranean, with initial output of 350 million cubic feet per day.

442,SLB,"Schlumberger, Subsea 7 in talks to form oil services joint venture","OSLO (Reuters) - Schlumberger (SLB.N), the world’s largest oilfield services firm, and smaller peer Subsea 7 (SUBC.OL) said on Friday they were entering exclusive talks to form a joint venture to deliver subsea installations and services for oilfields. The news lifted Subsea 7 shares on hopes the talks could be the first step toward a full takeover, in a sector that has already seen consolidation with the 2016 merger of Technip and FMC Technologies (FTI.N). In recent months, oil firms have returned to profits due to higher oil prices and the benefits of deep cost cuts they made during the downturn. But their suppliers are still feeling the squeeze and trying to cope with low profitability.  Since 2015 Schlumberger and Subsea 7 have collaborated for some of their work in designing, building and laying oil and gas production installations on the seabed. The two firms now aim to build a 50-50 joint venture to deliver subsea installations, maintenance and repair services. “The proposed joint venture will give us the opportunity to capitalize on the synergies already established and significantly improve subsea economics over the lifetime of the field,” Schlumberger said in a statement. Friday’s announcement and the Technip/FMC Technologies merger show the oilfield services market has changed in favor of more integrated solutions, said Arctic Securities analyst Tord Aasen Augestad “We view the deal as highly positive for Subsea 7,” he wrote in a note to clients, adding that the joint venture “improves their competitive position and creates a unique platform to capture market share in a recovering subsea market.”  Shares in Subsea 7 were up 5.3 percent at 1053 GMT. It was the top performer in the European oil and gas index .SXEP and the second-best performer of the pan-European  index.  “Speculative appeal, next move could be M&A; between the two groups,” said Natixis analyst Baptiste Lebacq. Subsea 7 top owner, Norwegian billionaire Kristian Siem, has long called for consolidation, saying it was the “way to go” to cope with drastic cost cuts from oil companies.

The news lifted Subsea 7 shares on hopes the talks could be the first step toward a full takeover, in a sector that has already seen consolidation with the 2016 merger of Technip and FMC Technologies (FTI.N). In recent months, oil firms have returned to profits due to higher oil prices and the benefits of deep cost cuts they made during the downturn. But their suppliers are still feeling the squeeze and trying to cope with low profitability.  Since 2015 Schlumberger and Subsea 7 have collaborated for some of their work in designing, building and laying oil and gas production installations on the seabed. The two firms now aim to build a 50-50 joint venture to deliver subsea installations, maintenance and repair services. “The proposed joint venture will give us the opportunity to capitalize on the synergies already established and significantly improve subsea economics over the lifetime of the field,” Schlumberger said in a statement. Friday’s announcement and the Technip/FMC Technologies merger show the oilfield services market has changed in favor of more integrated solutions, said Arctic Securities analyst Tord Aasen Augestad “We view the deal as highly positive for Subsea 7,” he wrote in a note to clients, adding that the joint venture “improves their competitive position and creates a unique platform to capture market share in a recovering subsea market.”  Shares in Subsea 7 were up 5.3 percent at 1053 GMT. It was the top performer in the European oil and gas index .SXEP and the second-best performer of the pan-European  index.  “Speculative appeal, next move could be M&A; between the two groups,” said Natixis analyst Baptiste Lebacq. Subsea 7 top owner, Norwegian billionaire Kristian Siem, has long called for consolidation, saying it was the “way to go” to cope with drastic cost cuts from oil companies.

445,SLB,UPDATE 2-Exxon selling stake in Canada's Terra Nova oil project,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is selling its entire stake in the Terra Nova oil project off the eastern coast of Canada, though the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer said it was committed to remaining an investor in the region. The project, located about 217 miles (350 km) off Newfoundland and Labrador, produced about 5,000 barrels of oil per day in 2016.  Exxon is selling all of its 19 percent stake in the project and initial bids are due March 30, according to data and a document from Schlumberger’s oil and gas asset sale business. Exxon confirmed the sale process, though said it does not involve other assets in the area. “We continuously review our asset portfolio to ensure it meets our strategic objectives,” Exxon spokeswoman Suann Guthrie said in a statement.      The Terra Nova project consists of a floating production, storage and offloading vessel to produce oil. The project has pumped 400 million barrels of oil and consists of 30 wells that pumped about 31,000 barrels per day last year, the document said.   PetroCanada, Husky Oil Ltd [HYOLTD.UL] and Murphy Oil Corp are other partners in the project. Shares of Exxon were barely changed in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $78.88.

They are essential to any offshore exploration plans * Schlumberger announced in January plans to exit the offshore and onshore seismic acquisition market due to weak returns. * “This could create a problem for oil companies in the future... They will have to do it (develop new technology) themselves or ensure that geophysical service companies can make sufficient margins to defend long-term investments,” she said * Earlier on Wednesday, the CEO told the conference she expected day rates for hiring seismic vessels to increase by around 10 percent in 2018 and around the same in 2019 * “It’s my best guess, but vessel utilisation is more important than day rates. If we get higher utilisation, day rates could be lower,” she told Reuters (Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis, editing by Gwladys Fouche)",2282018,http://www.reuters.com/article/oil-seismic-schlumberger/schlumbergers-exit-from-seismic-a-problem-for-oil-firms-seismic-firm-idUSL8N1QI5LO

451,SLB,Kenya's National Oil and Schlumberger sign field development deal,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s National Oil Corporation and U.S. oil services company Schlumberger have agreed to finalize a field development plan on behalf of the government for oil blocks in the northwest of the country. The East African nation discovered commercial oil reserves in its Lokichar basin in 2012. National Oil said in a statement seen by Reuters on Friday that the agreement with Schlumberger would create a development blueprint for the field in the next year. “This FDP (field development plan) will provide the government with an independent view of the development of the Lokichar oil discoveries, which will be useful in supporting the government in evaluating work already being done by investors Tullow, Africa Oil and Maersk,” National Oil said. Britain’s Tullow Oil and Canada’s Africa Oil were first to discover oil in Kenya, holding an equal share in the 10 BB and 13T blocks where Tullow is the operator.  French oil major Total later acquired a stake in the blocks from AP Moeller-Maersk and the Kenyan government is expected to take a stake through National Oil. National Oil did not disclose the value of the deal.   Tullow expects to reach a final investment decision (FID) on the project in 2019 and first oil production by 2021-22.  Last year the government signed an agreement with Tullow and its partners for a feasibility study on a proposed pipeline to transport the crude oil to a seaport on the Indian Ocean coast. Recoverable reserves are estimated at 750 million barrels and considered feasible for production with oil prices at $55 a barrel, which is below current levels. The ministry said last year that the pipeline — to run 820km (500 miles) between Lokichar and Lamu on Kenya’s coast —  would cost $2.1 billion and was expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021. National Oil handles the government’s interest in both the upstream and downstream oil activities.

453,SLB,Schlumberger fights to boost patent damages at U.S. Supreme Court,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday appeared divided over whether to make it easier for companies to recoup profits lost due to the unauthorized use of their patented technology overseas in a dispute involving Schlumberger NV (SLB.N), the world’s largest oilfield services provider. The nine justices heard about an hour of arguments that will resolve the amount of money that rival ION Geophysical Corp (IO.N) must pay for infringing Schlumberger technology that helps search for oil and gas beneath the ocean floor. Both companies are based in Houston. Some justices, including conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch and liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, expressed concerns about applying U.S. patent laws abroad, while others indicated that Schlumberger should be fully compensated.  Schlumberger is appealing a lower court ruling that barred it from recovering $93.4 million in lost profits stemming from foreign contracts the company said it missed out on as a result of the infringement.  Schlumberger said federal patent law protects against infringement that occurs when components of a patented invention are supplied from the United States for assembly abroad, and so it should be fully compensated for its lost foreign sales.  Gorsuch and Breyer expressed skepticism about imposing damages based on the use of the technology by ION’s overseas customers. Breyer said if other countries did the same it could pose problems for U.S. companies as well.  “I see chaos or confusion,” Breyer said.  Conservative Justices Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy, as well as liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, signaled sympathy for Schlumberger.  Kennedy told ION’s attorney Kannon Shanmugam that the company’s position would confine patent owners in how they use their own patents and mean they would not be fully compensated for infringement. Shanmugam said that U.S. patent laws have a “presumption against extraterritoriality.” A decision in Schlumberger’s favor would expand the ability of patent owners to recover foreign-based damages, increasing the threat posed by certain infringement suits in the United States. Schlumberger said that the lower court ruling harms innovation by allowing companies to infringe competitors’ patents while risking minimal punishment.  Other observers, including a group representing internet-based companies, said the opposite is true because extending patent damages beyond national borders would expose U.S. high-technology firms to greater patent-related risks overseas.  The case involves four patents owned by Schlumberger subsidiary WesternGeco related to an invention that more efficiently completes marine seismic surveys to help identify oil and gas drilling locations. ION developed a competing system and sold it to surveying companies abroad. WesternGeco sued in 2009, and a federal jury in Houston found that Ion infringed the patents and caused the company to lose contracts. The jury awarded $12.5 million in royalties as well as the $93.4 million in lost profits. In 2015, the Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent disputes, ruled that Schlumberger could not recoup the lost profits portion, saying U.S. patent law does not apply outside the country. President Donald Trump’s administration backed Schlumberger, and urged the justices to overturn the lower court ruling, which it said “systematically undercompensates” U.S. patent owners who participate in cross-border commerce. The justices are due to issue their ruling by the end of June.

Brent and U.S. crude turned negative after U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday criticized OPEC for output curbs that have helped raise global oil prices and said “artificially” high prices would not be accepted. U.S. and Brent crude were both down nearly 1 percent. [O/R] Schlumberger, a bellwether for the oilfield services and drilling industries, said global oil supply and demand were in balance and that investments in exploration and production were expected to rise about 5 percent internationally. The absence of normal seasonal softness indicated that supply and demand were in balance, and combined with “increased geopolitical risk” had driven up oil prices,” Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a call with analysts.         Oilfield service companies have benefited from a jump in U.S crude prices CLc1 to around $67 a barrel but providers such as Schlumberger and Halliburton (HAL.N) had signaled to investors that freezing weather in parts of the United States and frack sand delivery delays would be a negative on first-quarter results.  Overcapacity in the pressure pumping market also dampened earnings. Kibsgaard warned that the shale industry could face production challenges from drilling wells too close together, leading to lower output per well, and as producers move to less optimal areas. Despite the headwinds, Schlumberger’s profit rose to $525 million, or 38 cents per share, in the quarter, from $279 million, or 20 cents, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned 38 cents per share, beating analysts’ estimate of 37 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Schlumberger’s results were “fairly in line after expectations had already been tempered,” Capital One Securities analysts wrote in a note on Friday. Schlumberger expects to see growth in the North American pressure pumping market, but warned that its ability to raise prices would be constrained amid capacity additions.  The company anticipates add 1 million extra hydraulic horsepower this year, but deployed fewer frack fleets than anticipated in the quarter due to softer pricing and deployments by competitors.  Consultancy Rystad Energy estimates that some 3.3 million of hydraulic horsepower were added last year, and another 3.3 million will be added this year.

Schlumberger Production Management (SPM), formed in 2011 to develop client assets as the oilfield services major looked to diversify its business, had $1.4 billion in revenue in 2016.  Revenue from Schlumberger’s production group unit, of which SPM is a part of, had $2.96 billion in the latest first quarter. The unit allows the company to have a say in drilling decisions, oilfield management and even on hiring other Schlumberger units for service contracts.

465,SLB,UPDATE 1-Subsea 7 trades downs as Q1 lags,"(Adds share price, details) By Nerijus Adomaitis OSLO, April 26 (Reuters) - Offshore oil services firm Subsea 7 posted first-quarter results that missed expectations due to lower activity but maintained its outlook for the year, sending its shares lower. Its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) fell to $103 million, lagging expectations for $157 million in a Reuters poll of analysts, and down from $268 million in the same period a year ago. Subsea 7 shares opened 3.4 percent down from the previous day close, and were trading down 1.4 percent at 0821 GMT. It was the second-worst performer of the European oil and gas index , which was up 0.57 percent. “The lower revenue and adjusted EBITDA compared to the prior year reflected deterioration in activity levels due to seasonality of northern hemisphere operations and fewer large projects progressing with offshore campaigns,” the company said in a statement. While activity in the oil and gas industry is recovering from very low levels in the last three years, pricing remains challenging in the near term, Subsea 7 added. The company repeated that it still expected 2018 revenue to be in line with 2017, while its adjusted EBITDA margin, which stood at 26 percent last year, would be significantly lower. The margin was down to 12.7 percent in the first quarter, the lowest level since 2005, from 18 percent in the last quarter of 2017. On April 17 the Oslo-listed firm made an unsolicited offer to acquire Houston-based McDermott for $2 billion, but the U.S. rival has rejected the proposal repeatedly. The company said it had $1 billion in cash and undrawn credit facilities at the end of March. Subsea 7’s chairman, Norwegian billionaire Kristian Siem, who owns a fifth of the company, has long called for the industry to consolidate as a means to cope with cost-cutting by oil companies. A combination with McDermott could make Subsea 7 a market leader in supplying subsea installations and services to oil and gas firms, overtaking TechnipFMC and Saipem, said Oslo-based consultancy Rystad Energy. Subsea 7’s offer to McDermott comes after it started talks with Schlumberger earlier this year to form a joint venture to deliver subsea installations and services. The flurry of M&A; activity is happening as oil prices have risen to more than $70 a barrel, lifting the appetite for offshore investments. Subsea 7’s order backlog stood at $5.3 billion at the end of March, slightly higher than $5.2 billion at end-December 2017.

468,SLB,Russia gives tentative nod to Schlumberger's acquisition of EDC stake,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has given preliminary approval to a bid by U.S. oilfield services giant Schlumberger to acquire up to 49 percent of Russia’s Eurasia Drilling Co (EDC), an unexpected decision given a chilling in U.S.-Russian relations. Washington has introduced a number of sanctions, including restrictions on financing for Russian companies over Moscow’s role in Ukraine’s crisis and alleged meddling in the U.S. 2016 presidential election.  RIA news agency cited Igor Artemyev, head of Russia’s anti-monopoly body (FAS), as saying the regulator would quickly start talks with Schlumberger, the largest oilfield services company by revenue. “We (will) immediately start the talks with Schlumberger and hope that we are moving to the final stretch,” he was quoted by RIA as saying after a Russian government meeting on foreign investments. The FAS said later on Saturday that the government investment commission had decided to extend the time frame for examining the deal, but it was not immediately clear how long that could take. Schlumberger had initially planned to buy 51 percent in EDC, but decided to scale down its bid. The deal has faced difficulties as relations between Russia and the United States have deteriorated. This is a second attempt by Schlumberger to acquire Russia’s leading oilfield services provider. In 2015, Schlumberger agreed to buy 45.65 percent of EDC for $1.7 billion, but the deal fell through after the FAS repeatedly postponed its approval. Later that year, EDC delisted its shares on the London Stock Exchange. For Schlumberger, the investment would mean access to the Russian oil market, one of the world’s largest, at a time of rising crude prices.

470,SLB,"Sri Lanka to sign deals with Total, Schlumberger for seismic study","COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka will sign agreements with French oil and gas major Total and a subsidiary of U.S. firm Schlumberger for a seismic study off its east coast to evaluate any prospective oil resources, a top official said on Friday.  Vajira Dassanayake, the director general at Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat (PRDS), said a first deal signed with Total in 2016 to conduct a study off the eastern coast did not take place due to “some issues”.      “We are hoping to sign a new agreement with Total later this month,” Dassanayake told Reuters. Total had earlier signed a two-year agreement with PRDS to survey around 50,000 sq km off the east coast from the air, at a cost of $25 million to acquire data on unexplored areas.  Dassanayake said Total will invest $3 million to $10 million for the seismic study, while Eastern Echo Holding Ltd, a subsidiary of Schlumberger, will carry it out.  “It’s a marine survey. There will be more resources allocated this time compared to the previous agreement. They will have the marketing exclusivity for a certain period until they recover their cost,” Dassanayake said.  “Actual ownership of the data will be with the government of Sri Lanka. They (Total) have one year to negotiate with us and to give us a favorable contract for production and sharing.” Officials from Total and Schlumberger did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Sri Lanka produces no oil and is dependent on imports for all of its fuel requirements, despite trying to reinvigorate oil and gas exploration after the end nine years ago of its 25-year civil war with Tamil separatists.
