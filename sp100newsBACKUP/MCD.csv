1,MCD,Dim sum market stirs U.S. borrowers,"BRADENTON/NEW YORK, July 7 (IFR) - One of the U.S. high-grade market’s favorites, Caterpillar Financial Services, is becoming quite the regular issuer in the offshore yuan-denominated market, also called the dim sum or CNH bond market.  On Wednesday CAT (CAT.N) priced a 2.3 billion yuan ($355 million) bond, its second trade in a market that is looking increasingly interesting to U.S. corporations that do business in China.  So far, only five foreign multi-nationals have tapped the dim sum market, McDonald’s (MCD.N), Caterpillar, Unilever (UNc.AS), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Fonterra. But the market averages a good five to 10 deals per week, and outstanding bonds have swelled to more than 130 billion yuan so far. Many expect that volume to exceed 200 billion yuan by the end of the year.  What’s more, a greater proportion of that volume is likely to come from U.S. companies that produce revenue in China. The dim sum market is becoming more user-friendly and American companies are investing more in China.  “For us, it’s part of Caterpillar Financial’s normal strategy that we look to fund in the local market,” said Jim Dugan, spokesman at Caterpillar Inc. “In that sense there’s a great deal of interest in the renminbi market but for us it’s part of our broader strategy.”  Borrowers in need of renminbi funding generally have two options to raise capital directly in the currency. They can access the mainland-China bank loan market where rates are regulated by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) or, as Caterpillar and McDonald’s before it did, they can issue in the offshore renminbi bond market, where rates are market driven, and remit the proceeds to China.  In the current economic climate at least, the offshore market is by far the cheaper alternative for borrowers.  “A two-year mainland renminbi bank loan for Caterpillar would have cost roughly 6.4% compared to the 1.35% rate Caterpillar was able to achieve in the CNH bond market,” said Caroline Owen, head of DCM North America for Standard Chartered, the sole bookrunner on Caterpillar’s offshore yuan transaction.  The 6.4% loan rate is generally for a strong issuer like CAT. The PBOC sets the base rate and allows mainland China banks to charge borrowers as low as 90% of that rate for the highest quality borrower. It’s essentially a PBOC-set floor put in place so banks don’t try to get market share by undercutting and putting themselves in jeopardy. However, banks can, and do, charge well over 100% of the base rate for riskier credits.  For the cost savings alone, the dim sum bond market looks like the better alternative for companies in need of renminbi funding. But there is another big factor motivating borrowers to choose a bond over a loan.  “Ultimately, the central bank controls the tap on mainland lending and it can take measures to dry up liquidity,” Owen said. “However, by funding via the CNH bond market, issuers have the security of knowing they have access to funds when they need them.”  All the obvious advantages of the dim sum market are naturally drawing a lot of interest.  “Although the market is still in its infancy, we have very quickly seen the emergence of a variety of credits, ranging from high quality household names to high yield and unrated issuers,” Owen said.  That said, the dim sum market can still be tough to swallow. The ability to bring CNH bond proceeds into China is strictly controlled by the Chinese regulators. In fact, the approval process to do an offshore yuan-denominated bond is quite lengthy.  “The full potential for growth in issuance volumes, however, is limited by the amount of proceeds issuers can remit into the mainland to finance their operations,” Owen said.  Deal size is essentially capped at what Chinese authorities allow issuers to bring across the border — and is determined by what is known as the foreign debt quota, the difference between the total investment and minimum registered capital.  Issuers seeking to remit bond proceeds to the mainland must apply for approval from the regulators stating the amount they wish to bring into China. Typically, issuers will wait for the required remittance approvals before bringing the deal. Approval from regulators could come within weeks, or within months. Once issuers get approval, they then hit the bond market and hope to get enough demand to reach their approved amount.  Caterpillar, for its part, got the green light for a sizeable haul. The 2.3 billion yuan deal was large compared to its predecessors. Only eight issuers have ever attempted a deal 2 billion yuan or larger, and five of those were government affiliated. The other three, Guangzhou R&F, Melco Crown and Ping An (2318.HK), got done in a much better market environment and actually priced at much higher rates. CAT impressively priced in size in shaky market conditions.  The demand for CNH bonds is high in part because investors don’t have many other options.  “Investors who have access to renminbi really have very limited investment alternatives. They can place their cash in CNH deposit accounts paying about 50-60bp - not a lot, especially when you factor in inflation - or invest in offshore yuan-denominated bonds at a relatively higher yield,” said Owen.  Demand has caused yields on CNH bonds to come in quite dramatically. When Caterpillar made its dim sum debut in November 2010, it paid 2% for a 1 billion yuan two-year bond.  The majority of investors so far are in Asia. But Wednesday’s trade actually saw 20% participation from European investors. It was the largest European participation in the CNH bond market this year.  Standard Chartered, Caterpillar’s lead arranger, is ranked number two behind HSBC in offshore yuan-denominated bond league table.

3,MCD,"Mississippi most obese state, Colorado least","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The number of obese U.S. adults rose in 16 states in the last year, helping to push obesity rates in a dozen states above 30 percent, according to a report released on Thursday.  By that measure, Mississippi is the fattest state in the union with an adult obesity rate of 34.4 percent. Colorado is the least obese — with a rate of 19.8 percent — and the only state with an adult obesity rate below 20 percent, according to “F as in Fat,” an annual report from the Trust for America’s Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  While the number of states showing significant year-over-year increases in obesity has been slowing, no state chalked up an actual decline. Even Colorado does not win high marks — its score means one in five state residents is at higher risk for conditions like heart disease and diabetes.  “Today, the state with the lowest adult obesity rate would have had the highest rate in 1995,” said Jeff Levi, executive director of the Trust for America’s Health.  Four years ago, only one U.S. state had an adult obesity rate above 30 percent, according to the report, which defines adult obesity as a having a body mass index — a weight-to-height ratio — of 30 or more.  Over the last two decades, people in the United States have been eating less nutritious food and more of it. At the same time, activity levels have fallen, Levi said.  “If we’re going to reverse the obesity trends, willpower alone won’t do it. We’re going to have to make healthier choices easier for Americans,” Levi said.  Public health experts around the world have raised the alarm about exploding rates of obesity — particularly among children — and many are promoting efforts to encourage exercise and easier access to affordable, healthy food.  In the United States — where two-thirds of adults and nearly one-third of children are obese or overweight — the obesity epidemic is sending healthcare costs higher and threatening everything from worker productivity to military recruitment.  Some groups say such behavioral initiatives are not enough, arguing that food manufacturers and restaurant chains need limits on how they market to children.  The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a U.S. consumer group, last year sued McDonald’s Corp to stop the world’s largest hamburger chain from using Happy Meal toys to lure children into its restaurants. Last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics — a group of U.S. pediatricians — called for a ban on junk food ads aimed at children.  The food industry — which has significantly increased portion sizes in restaurants and packaged foods like sugar-sweetened beverages over the last 20 years — is fighting regulation efforts and has adopted the mantra of “personal responsibility.”  To that end, food and beverage companies say consumers have the right to choose what they eat and should balance their caloric intake with activity.  The report released on Thursday showed that over the past 15 years, seven states have doubled their rate of obesity and 10 states have doubled their rate of diabetes.  Since 1995, obesity rates have risen fastest in Oklahoma, Alabama and Tennessee, while Colorado, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., had the slowest increases.  Adults from racial and ethnic minority groups, as well as those with less education and lower incomes, continue to have the highest overall obesity rates.

4,MCD,"Yum posts profit beat, raises 2011 estimate","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - KFC parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) raised its full-year earnings forecast after China helped deliver quarterly earnings for the company that topped Wall Street’s forecast.  Yum shares rose 2.2 percent after hours.  Yum, based in Louisville, Kentucky, has more than 4,000 restaurants, mostly KFC outlets, in China. It is the largest Western restaurant brand in China, with far more restaurants than rivals like McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O).  Based on strength in China and other international markets, Yum raised its full-year earnings per share growth forecast to at least 12 percent from at least 10 percent previously.  Investors said the boost was a signal of confidence from Yum management.  “It shows that they believe the economic haze is clearing,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive and founder of YCMNET Advisors, which owns shares in Yum rival McDonald’s.  China, the world’s fastest growing major economy, is Yum’s biggest profit driver and accounts for just over 40 percent of overall profits.  Yum, which also owns the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, is widely regarded as one of the biggest China plays for investors in the U.S. stock market. (Graphic of Yum's stock performance: r.reuters.com/kek62s)  Closely watched sales at Yum’s established restaurants in China rose 18 percent in the second quarter. That increase came as higher wage and commodity costs caused the company’s China restaurant margins to fall 0.5 basis points to 19.7 percent.  Sales at established restaurants in Yum Restaurants International (YRI) were up 2 percent for the quarter. The YRI division includes Yum’s other non-U.S. markets such as France, India and Russia.  “China is just an awesome growth engine. YRI is another and that’s accelerating,” said Tucker Brown, a research principal at Sustainable Growth Advisors, which holds Yum in its SGA Global Growth Fund.  Yum’s overseas strength offset a 4 percent decline in U.S. same-store sales.  The United States is Yum’s most challenging market and during the second quarter that ended June 11 same-store sales fell 5 percent at Taco Bell, 2 percent at Pizza Hut and 5 percent at Kentucky Fried Chicken.  The company, which is still feeling the effects of a quickly dropped lawsuit over the contents of Taco Bell’s ground beef, expects U.S. profit performance to improve by the fourth quarter.  “For the full year, we expect strong performance from both China and YRI as well as the benefit from foreign currency translation to overcome a challenging year” in the United States, Chief Executive David Novak said in a statement.  Rising food costs are an ongoing issue for restaurants and Yum said it expects higher inflation than previously thought in China and the United States.  Yum now sees China commodity inflation of about 9 percent for the full year, versus about 7 percent previously.  It also ticked up its U.S. inflation forecast to about 7 percent for the full year, versus 6 percent previously.  Yum’s second-quarter net income rose to $316 million, or 65 cents per share, from $286 million, or 59 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding special items, profit was 66 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 5 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue rose to $2.8 billion from $2.6 billion a year earlier.  Shares in Yum closed up 1.1 percent at $55.58 on the New York Stock Exchange after data showed that China’s economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter. That report eased fears of a hard landing and strengthened Beijing’s resolve to fight persistently high inflation.

6,MCD,Eateries eye healthier kids' food amid pressure,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Nineteen U.S. restaurant chains, including Burger King and DineEquity’s IHOP, are backing an industry effort to serve and promote healthier meals for children.  The announcement on Wednesday from the National Restaurant Association (NRA) comes as public health officials and consumer advocates pressure restaurants to reduce calories in, and improve the nutritional value of, meals for children — nearly one in three of whom are either obese or overweight.  The 19 chains collectively operate some 15,000 restaurants that will participate in the trade group’s “Kids LiveWell” initiative, NRA said.  McDonald’s Corp, the world’s largest hamburger chain, is not among the 19.  Other participating brands include Au Bon Pain, Brinker International’s Chili’s Grill & Bar, Cracker Barrel, Denny’s, El Pollo Loco, Outback Steakhouse OSI and Sizzler.  The NRA said the voluntary program would focus on increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, whole grains and low-fat dairy, while limiting unhealthy fats, sugars and sodium.  Participants agreed to offer a children’s meal — comprising an entree, a side and a drink — with 600 calories or less that meets the above criteria.  They also promised to offer at least one other individual item with 200 calories or less.  “This is a great start to help empower consumers — kids and parents especially — with more healthier choices at restaurants,” Robert Post, deputy director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, said in a statement.  “It’s a good baby-step forward, but they have a lot more work to do,” said Margo Wootan, nutrition policy director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a consumer group that advocates healthier restaurant food for children.  “Kids’ meals aren’t the occasional indulgence that they once were. They are a regular part of children’s diets,” said Wootan, who hopes restaurant menus will one day offer a greater number of appealing healthy choices for youngsters.  As part of the effort, Burger King this month is removing French fries and soda as the default for its kids’ meals. Under the new system, diners will have to make a choice between those options or sliced apples, fat-free milk or juice before the order can be completed, a Burger King spokeswoman said.  Wootan called Burger King’s move the most significant piece of Wednesday’s announcement.  “There’s a huge body of literature showing that people stick with the default. We could leave the default to chance or try to make it better,” Wootan said, noting that restaurants at Walt Disney Co’s theme parks have shown that parents are more likely to choose healthier kids’ meal add-ons such as fruit and low-fat milk when those are the default option.  Some chains, including IHOP, already have lowered calorie counts on select menu items for children.  The “Kids LiveWell” initiative comes amid grass-roots efforts to force restaurants in the same direction.  For example, San Francisco and nearby Santa Clara County have passed laws that would curb free toy giveaways with unhealthy restaurant meals for children.  The restaurant industry has fought such efforts by backing laws that restrict local lawmakers’ ability to regulate restaurant marketing and other activities.  The CSPI last year sued McDonald’s to stop the chain from using Happy Meal toys to lure children into its restaurants. And last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics — a group of pediatricians — called for a ban on junk food ads aimed at children.  McDonald’s is not among the original participants in the “Kids LiveWell” initiative. Neither is sandwich chain Subway, which Wootan said offers the industry’s healthiest kids’ meals.  A McDonald’s spokeswoman said the company “will evaluate participation in this program in the future.”  Subway was not immediately available for a comment.

8,MCD,Taco Bell still hurting from beef quality lawsuit,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) expects damage from a dropped lawsuit over the quality of Taco Bell’s ground beef to linger in the third quarter, but to ease during the remainder of the year, and laid out plans to turn the business around.  Taco Bell is Yum’s most profitable U.S. brand. A sharp decline in closely watched same-restaurant sales, along with higher-than-normal commodity inflation, resulted in a 28 percent decline in U.S. operating profit for the second quarter.  A California woman in January sued Taco Bell over the contents of its seasoned beef. Taco Bell responded by saying it planned to take legal action against the “false statements” being made about its food. In April, the woman voluntarily dismissed her lawsuit.  But the damage was done. Taco Bell sales at established restaurants, which were up 2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, were flat in the first quarter and tumbled 5 percent in the second quarter ended June 11.  “The negative sales that resulted from the lawsuit have lasted longer than any one of us thought,” Chief Executive David Novak said on a conference call with analysts.  Novak said Taco Bell’s light users, who stopped visiting after the lawsuit made headlines, have been surprisingly difficult to bring back.  “We expect slow improvement from the low point in the second quarter,” said Novak, who added that it usually takes about six months to fully recover from food quality-related issues.  To that end, Chief Financial Officer Rick Carucci told analysts to expect another decline in same-restaurant sales for the current quarter.  “Taco Bell will be negative in the third quarter but not as bad as the 5 percent” in the second quarter, Carucci said.  The executives said Taco Bell would announce new products this year and roll out “more compelling” advertising in a bid to improve results.  We “are determined to turn around these unacceptable results. Believe me, all hands are on deck,” Novak said.  Yum, which also owns the KFC and Pizza Hut brands, is one of the biggest fast-food restaurant operators in the United States.  But its U.S. business has been a persistent laggard compared with Yum’s operations in China and other international markets — which combined generate 75 percent of Yum’s operating profit.  On Wednesday, Yum raised its full-year earnings forecast and posted better-than-expected second-quarter results on strength in China and its other international markets.  While same-restaurant sales for China were up 18 percent in the quarter and rose 2 percent in its other international markets, they fell 4 percent overall in the United States on declines at Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC.  The company said it expects U.S. profit performance to improve by the fourth quarter.  While the second-quarter should mark a bottom for Taco Bell, “Yum’s U.S. business takes the ‘prize’ for the worst performing restaurant business we know of,” JP Morgan analyst John Ivankoe said in a client note.  Nevertheless, Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski said Yum’s U.S. results are not a bellwether for the rest of the fast-food industry.  “While these numbers are poor, we do not believe they are indicative of a worsening U.S. quick-service sector overall,” Kalinowski said.  Michael Yoshikami, chief executive and founder of YCMNET Advisors, said Yum rival McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) was once in Yum’s shoes, with strong emerging market growth and same-restaurant sales problems in the United States.  McDonald’s turned it around by moves including expansion of its low-price Dollar Menu and the introduction of coffee and other beverages, he said.  “They’re going to have to figure out a way to revitalize their domestic menu,” said Yoshikami, who owns McDonald’s shares and closely monitors Yum results.

9,MCD,Taco Bell still hurting from beef quality lawsuit,"   * Dropped lawsuit over beef hits occasional diners   * Taco Bell same-store sales fell 5 percent in 2nd qtr   * Parent Yum working to stabilize business, revive growth   By Lisa Baertlein   LOS ANGELES, July 14 (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) expects damage from a dropped lawsuit over the quality of Taco Bell’s ground beef to linger in the third quarter, but to ease during the remainder of the year, and laid out plans to turn the business around.   Taco Bell is Yum’s most profitable U.S. brand. A sharp decline in closely watched same-restaurant sales, along with higher-than-normal commodity inflation, resulted in a 28 percent decline in U.S. operating profit for the second quarter.   A California woman in January sued Taco Bell over the contents of its seasoned beef. Taco Bell responded by saying it planned to take legal action against the “false statements” being made about its food. In April, the woman voluntarily dismissed her lawsuit.

10,MCD,McDonald's -- Happy Meal suit could boost ad costs," * McDonald’s faces lawsuit over Happy Meal advertising   * Suit would force change in ad buys-McDonald’s lawyer   SAN FRANCISCO, July 15 (Reuters) - Advertising costs for McDonald’s Corp would be heightened if a California lawsuit over its Happy Meal toy promotions proved successful, a lawyer for the company said in court.   McDonald’s (MCD.N) is accused of unfairly using toys to lure children into its restaurants, and a proposed class action lawsuit seeks to stop the company from advertising toys in connection with Happy Meals in California.   The Happy Meal, which packages children’s meals with toys, has been a huge hit for McDonald’s — making the company one of the world’s largest toy distributors and spawning me-too offerings at most other fast-food chains.   McDonald’s use of Happy Meal toys has come under fire from public health officials, parents and lawmakers who are frustrated with rising childhood obesity rates and weak anti-obesity efforts from restaurant operators, which are largely self-regulated.   At a hearing on Friday in a San Francisco federal court, McDonald’s attorney Scott Elder said an injunction against advertising Happy Meal toys in California would make the chain unable to purchase ads on a national basis.   Buying ads nationally is “a lot cheaper,” Elder said.   McDonald’s is asking that the case be litigated in the federal courts, which are generally viewed by corporate defendants as friendlier than state courts. In order to succeed, McDonald’s has to prove the lawsuit involves potential costs of over $5 million.   An attorney for the plaintiff, Stephen Gardner, argued that food chains frequently change marketing practices, and that the case should be returned to a California state court.   U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney did not say whether she would grant the McDonald’s request.   The proposed class action lawsuit in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, is Parham v. McDonald’s Corporation et al, 11-511.  (Reporting by Dan Levine, editing by Gerald E.

11,MCD,Calorie labeling at restaurants may hold surprises," * Menu calorie counts often inaccurate - research   * Possible hurdle for new U.S. healthcare law   * More than a third of U.S. adults are obese   By Frederik Joelving   NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters Health) - U.S. restaurants are starting to list calorie counts on menu items, but new research shows those labels may not be accurate enough, particularly when it comes to individual items.   “The big story may be that there is such a huge spread in the numbers,” said Lorien Urban, a nutrition researcher at Tufts University in Boston, who worked on the study of dozens of restaurants in three states.   “Essentially what that is saying is, you really don’t know what you are getting.”   All told, only seven percent of the French fries, burgers and other food items the team sampled were within 10 calories from the stated values.   That could be a hurdle for the new U.S. healthcare law, which requires restaurants with 20 or more locations to list calories on their menus in the hopes this will help curb the nation’s obesity epidemic   According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than a third of U.S. adults are now obese. And one in six children and teenagers land in that category, setting them up for heart disease and other ailments down the road.   While health regulators are trying to tackle the problem from different angles, one of the most obvious tactics is to get Americans to reverse the trend of overeating that has plagued the country for decades — particularly in restaurants.   “Currently, Americans are getting a third of their calories away from home,” Urban told Reuters Health. “We think labeling of all foods is going to be helpful, because people are eating a lot more calories than they think.”   The new work, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (bit.ly/4HWZ7), is the first large study to test the reliability of existing menus.   Urban’s team visited 42 quick-serve and sit-down restaurants in Massachusetts, Arkansas and Indiana, and ordered take-out for 269 different food items.   In lab tests, they found 40 percent of the foods contained at least 10 calories more than stated, while 52 percent had at least 10 calories fewer.   And nearly one in five items packed 100 or more excess calories — a finding that was most pronounced for lower-calorie foods.   That’s a problem, Urban said, because downing 100 calories more than you need every day will lead to weight gains of between 11 and 33 pounds over a year.   Sit-down restaurants were the main culprit behind the extra calories, because portion sizes varied quite a bit, she said.   “There were several cases where we just got a lot more than we thought they were going to give us,” Urban said.   Joy Dubost of the National Restaurant Association said the group was pleased to see that calorie labeling at restaurants is accurate on average.   “Restaurant food is hand prepared, which can create some variation, but this study shows that variance in caloric information to be small in most cases,” she said in a statement to Reuters Health.   “With the new menu labeling law, we know that many restaurant chains are looking at tighter kitchen quality control standards, from the weight of the meals to the package sizes used for take out.”   Even if menus were 100 percent accurate, there is no ironclad proof that calorie labeling works as intended, and researchers remain divided on the issue.   In February, for instance, one New York study found menu labeling at restaurants such as McDonald’s (MCD.N), Burger King, Wendy’s WEN.N and KFC (YUM.N) had made no dent in youngsters’ appetite for calorie-crammed fare.   “We, and others, haven’t yet found evidence that labeling encourages large scale changes in purchasing of fast food,” Brian Elbel, who worked on that study, told Reuters Health by email. “We haven’t looked at sit down places, but should,” added Elbel, of New York University School of Medicine.   Urban countered that most studies show menu labeling does work, particularly when it includes information on how many daily calories a person should eat to maintain a healthy weight.   “People need to know that 2,000 calories is all an average person needs a day,” said Urban. “Once you put that on the label it is very effective. The majority of studies show that.”   Her advice to weight-conscious consumers? Order foods you have more control over, like salads with the dressing or the cheese on the side.   “That salad with ranch dressing probably has a lot more calories than you think it does,” she said. “There is research to show that even nutrition experts are really bad at looking at a plate and telling how many calories are in there.”   ",7192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-restaurants/calorie-labeling-at-restaurants-may-hold-surprises-idUSN1E76I1V020110719

14,MCD,McDonald's super-size Olympics plan upsets health groups,"LONDON (Reuters) - London was failing in its pledge to create the healthiest Olympics ever, health groups said, after McDonald’s fast-food chain said it was to build its biggest and busiest restaurant in the world to serve the Games next summer.  The largest of its planned four temporary restaurants in the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London, will seat more than 1,500 people, while a total of 1.75 million burger and chips meals expected to be served during the 29 days of competition.  The previous Labour government had pledged to use the Olympics to get two million more Britons to adopt an active lifestyle to try to battle obesity.  “Given many countries in the developed world, and some in the developing world, are facing a major problem with obesity, it is unfortunate that McDonalds are major sponsors at the 2012 London Olympics,” the doctors’ professional organization, the British Medical Association, said in a statement on Thursday.  “The BMA does not believe individuals should stop buying McDonalds but we need to get the message across that these products should be seen as very rare treats.”  Grahame Morris, who sits on parliament’s health committee, said in a statement: “Given the huge public health issues of childhood obesity, it is legitimate to question whether having the world’s biggest McDonald’s at the Olympic Park is sending an appropriate message to our young people.”  McDonald’s is a long-standing official Olympic sponsor with an exclusive deal that ensures it is the only branded restaurant in the park.  Two of the Olympic restaurants will be open to the public, and the other two will be in the athletes’ village and media center.  When asked about the health criticisms, a spokeswoman said in a statement: “There is no doubt that McDonald’s food can fit into a balanced, active lifestyle and we offer a range of choices on our menu, as well as nutritional information on our trayliners, website and on packaging, to help our customers make an informed choice.”  Separately, Jill McDonald, chief executive of McDonald’s UK, said it was “hugely exciting” to be involved in the greatest sporting event in the world, and that the restaurants would help meet the London organizing committee’s (LOCOG) green objectives, with all four restaurants being re-used after the Games.  McDonald’s is not the only sponsor to have come in for criticism.  Coca-Cola, another long-standing official sponsor, and confectioner Cadbury, signed up by LOCOG as a domestic sponsor, also go against the ambitions of the Games, health and welfare charity Sustain said.  “The ambition in the bid was to promote healthy living, and the sponsorship will promote fizzy drinks, chocolate and burgers, so it’s clear there is a mismatch between sponsorship arrangements and the ambition to make this the greenest and healthiest games yet,” a Sustain spokeswoman said.

17,MCD,"Earnings, hope for debt deal brighten Wall Street","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors poured into tech shares on Friday as promising chipmaker earnings and optimism that a solution was on the horizon for the U.S. debt stalemate triggered a move into growth-oriented shares.  The Dow was held back by Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), with shares of the heavy equipment maker falling 5.8 percent on disappointing results. The stock exerted a 48.6-point drag on the Dow, which ended off 43 points.  The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 2.2 percent for the week, lifted by strong earnings and a new bailout plan for Greece to contain Europe’s debt crisis. Stocks have been restrained, however, by the long slog of negotiations to resolve the U.S. debt crisis.  “It’s likely an agreement in any form will cause a relief rally for equities,” said Andrew Slimmon, managing director, global investment solutions at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in Chicago.  “Coming on the heels of overall pretty good earnings numbers and some sort of resolution in Greece and that could make for a rally in the market,” he said.  President Barack Obama insisted on Friday he was prepared to make “tough choices” for a sweeping deficit-reduction deal to avert a U.S. default, despite Democrats warning him not to make too many concessions.  Semiconductor shares led the market on Friday after Sandisk SNDK.O, a maker of flash memory chips used in smartphones and tablets like the iPad, and Advanced Micro Devices AMD.N reported strong results late Thursday. The PHLX Semiconductor index .SOX rose 2.4 percent, led by AMD, which jumped 19.2 percent to $7.75.  “Nasdaq has more things out on the risk curve, and one of the things our folks have been saying is that the risk-on button should be pushed here,” said Glenn Starkman, global head of sales trading at Dahlman Rose in New York.  “You might see some rotation into things like energy, into materials and industrials as well as technology and money might rotate out of things like defensives.”  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 43.25 points, or 0.34 percent, to 12,681.16. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX added 1.22 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,345.02. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC gained 24.40 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,858.83.  For the week, along with the S&P’s 2.2 percent, the Dow rose 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 2.5 percent.  The second bailout for Greece supported sentiment, even as Fitch ratings agency on Friday said Greece would be in temporary default as the result of the new rescue plan. Fitch pledged to give Greece a higher, “low speculative grade” rating after its bonds had been exchanged and said Athens now had some hope of tackling its debt mountain.  Caterpillar, a maker of equipment used in mining and construction, has been a stalwart performer in recent years and was the top Dow performer for 2010, but rising labor and materials costs hit earnings.  Fellow Dow component McDonald’s Corp’s (MCD.N) income topped estimates, sending the stock up 2.3 percent to $88.56.  Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) posted a greater-than-expected jump in its fiscal fourth-quarter profit but sales of its flagship Windows software disappointed for a third straight quarter. The Dow component rose 1.6 percent to $27.53.  But General Electric Co (GE.N) dipped 0.6 percent to $19.04, even as it reported a 21.6 percent jump in quarterly profit.  Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) lost 2.2 percent to $36.74 after the telecom giant posted second-quarter results and named a new chief executive officer.  Volume was light with about 5.81 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, well below the daily average of 7.48 billion.

The Dow was held back by Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), with shares of the heavy equipment maker falling 5.8 percent on disappointing results. The stock exerted a 48.6-point drag on the Dow, which ended off 43 points.   The benchmark S&P 500 index rose 2.2 percent for the week, lifted by strong earnings and a new bailout plan for Greece to contain Europe’s debt crisis. Stocks have been restrained, however, by the long slog of negotiations to resolve the U.S. debt crisis.   “It’s likely an agreement in any form will cause a relief rally for equities,” said Andrew Slimmon, managing director, global investment solutions at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in Chicago.   “Coming on the heels of overall pretty good earnings numbers and some sort of resolution in Greece and that could make for a rally in the market,” he said.   President Barack Obama insisted on Friday he was prepared to make “tough choices” for a sweeping deficit-reduction deal to avert a U.S. default, despite Democrats warning him not to make too many concessions.

The second bailout for Greece supported sentiment, even as Fitch ratings agency on Friday said Greece would be in temporary default as the result of the new rescue plan.

20,MCD,Low prices help McDonald's beat profit expectations,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday as low prices brought in strong sales in Europe and the United States. The company’s share price rose 3.1 percent.  June sales at restaurants open at least 13 months were far stronger than analysts expected. During the month, same-restaurant sales were up 6.9 percent in the United States, 9.1 percent in Europe and 4.8 percent in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit.  Analysts were expecting June same-restaurant sales to rise 2 percent in the United States, 3 percent in Europe and 2 percent in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit.  Europe is McDonald’s largest market for sales, contributing about 40 percent of revenue. The United States is a close second.  “It’s the consistency of the everyday value message that has helped them a lot,” said Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matthew DiFrisco, who added that McDonald’s is good at adjusting its marketing to keep customers coming in.  McDonald’s has been taking market share from its fast food peers for many months. It has benefited from improving food quality, adding Dollar Menu items and introducing high-margin beverages such as coffee and fruit smoothies to broaden its appeal beyond the young men who account for the biggest share of sales at most other fast-food chains.  It is also renovating restaurants in Europe and the United States.  Europe’s top performers were France, Britain and Russia.  “Broadly speaking, there was just a little bit of a lift in people’s willingness to spend in Europe,” said Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore.  McDonald’s global same-restaurant sales rose 5.6 percent in the second quarter. It forecast July results that are up 4 percent to 5 percent overall.  Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski, who correctly signaled that the June U.S. result would be significantly above what many analysts were targeting, said some key competitors are floundering.  In particular, he said, Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST.O) — one of privately held Burger King’s biggest franchisees — saw same-restaurant sales at its Burger King BKCBK.UL restaurants fell 3.6 percent in the second quarter.  Rival Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) recently reported another quarter of strong earnings based on growth in China, but its U.S. Taco Bell business is hurting from a dismissed lawsuit over the quality of its ground beef.  Shares in Yum, also the parent of the KFC and Pizza Hut chains, were up 0.4 percent. Stock in burger chain Wendy’s WEN.N was up 1.3 percent.  Shares of McDonald’s, which has 32,000 restaurants, were up $2.69 to $89.22 on the New York Stock Exchange in the middle of the trading day. The shares closed at an all-time high of $86.54 on Thursday.  Second-quarter net income rose 15 percent to $1.41 billion, or $1.35 per share, topping the average analyst forecast of $1.28 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Foreign currency translation boosted earnings by 10 cents per share in the second quarter.  Revenue rose to $6.91 billion from $5.95 billion.  Analysts said the strong results showed that McDonald’s has pricing power.  “We will continue to consider future price increases,” McDonald’s Chief Financial Officer Peter Bensen said on a conference call with analysts.  McDonald’s has raised prices on some premium products to help offset higher food costs. The company still expects those costs to rise 4 percent to 4.5 percent in the United States and Europe this year.  McDonald’s wants customers to keep coming through its doors, so Bensen said it would be “judicious” with additional price hikes.  “You can bet their competitors wish they would take pricing,” said Victory Capital Management analyst Dave Kolpak. “You can’t do it if McDonald’s doesn’t. They’re putting the heat on the competition.”  ",7222011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds/low-prices-help-mcdonalds-beat-profit-expectations-idUSTRE76L28Y20110722

26,MCD,"Futures fall 1.0 percent, debt talks produce no deal","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock index futures fell more than 1.0 percent on Sunday as the failure by the government to come to an agreement on the debt ceiling made the prospects of a default— once considered an impossible outcome— more likely.  Congress and the White House remained at odds over a deal and House Speaker John Boehner pulled out of talks with President Barack Obama on Friday, killing hopes for a weekend deal, as had been widely expected.  White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley warned that there would be a “few stressful days” ahead for financial markets, with the deadline to lift the $14.3 trillion U.S. borrowing limit now only nine days away.  A default “has the potential to be like Lehman on steroids,” said Jim Awad, managing director at Zephyr Management in New York. “It is a very serious near-term issue, even if markets are still assuming it won’t happen.”  “A default is not priced into markets right now,” he added.

27,MCD,Dunkin' Brands may raise more than $400 million in IPO,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Dunkin’ Brands Group this week plans to raise up to $400.5 million in an initial public offering that would help fuel the U.S. expansion of its Dunkin’ Donuts coffee brand.  The Canton, Massachusetts-based company wants to double the number of Dunkin’ Donuts outlets in the United States over the coming 20 years.  Dunkin’ Donuts has an extremely loyal following in the United States, where it touts itself as a seller of coffee for the working class. The chain lags bigger rival Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) when it comes to U.S. store numbers, but has successfully challenged its bigger rival in the grocery aisle.  Dunkin’ Brands, which also owns the Baskin-Robbins ice cream store brand, plans to sell 22.25 million IPO shares at $16 to $18 per share, according to a regulatory filing.  Pricing will be set on Tuesday evening and shares will begin trading on Wednesday, syndicate desks involved in the deal told Reuters.  Private equity firms Bain Capital, Carlyle Group CYL.UL Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners bought Dunkin’ Brands from global spirits company Pernod Ricard SA (PERP.PA) for $2.4 billion in 2006 and took it private.  If the IPO price lands at the range’s midpoint of $17 per share, Dunkin’ Brands’ market value would be about $2.15 billion.  Based on those figures, the company’s shares would trade at 3.7 times 2010 sales, a richer valuation than Starbucks, which at the close of trade on Monday traded at 2.8 times calendar 2010 sales.  “It’s a fairly high valuation, but I could make a case for buying the stock,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive and founder of YCMNET Advisors in Walnut Creek, California.  While Starbucks has built a global following selling fancy coffee drinks to relatively upscale consumers, Dunkin’ Donuts takes pride in its blue-collar clientele.  “Low-cost food products are going to do well in a more difficult economy,” said Yoshikami, who added that he prefers McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) — which has been expanding coffee sales through its McCafe program — over Dunkin’ Donuts.  Dunkin’ Donuts has a devoted following in the eastern United States, where almost 6,700 of its roughly 6,800 domestic outlets are located. The chain also has more than 3,000 international stores.  Yoshikami said Dunkin’ Donuts has huge potential, particularly on the East Coast.  The chain plans to focus on markets east of the Mississippi River, including Philadelphia, Chicago and South Florida. Longer term, it sees the western United States as a significant growth opportunity. Dunkin’ Donuts has about 100 stores in the region now.  Starbucks already has blanketed the United States with cafes. More than 11,000 of its 17,000 global cafes are located in the United States. As a result, its expansion is focused mainly on overseas markets like China.  The world’s biggest coffee chain stumbled when the U.S. slipped into recession. When Starbucks was busy restructuring its global business, Dunkin’ Donuts debuted its bagged coffee in U.S. supermarkets and drained market share from Starbucks.  The smaller company also had a successful advertising campaign featuring the slogan “America Runs on Dunkin’.”  Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys Inc, a consumer and brand loyalty consulting firm, called that campaign a coup for Dunkin’ Donuts, which has ranked No. 1 for customer loyalty and engagement in coffee over the past five years.  Starbucks ranks second, McDonald’s is third and Canadian chain Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO is fourth, Passikoff said.  During 2010, Dunkin’ Brands’ revenue was $577.1 million and its net income was $26.9 million.  Baskin-Robbins is the company’s more international brand, with just over 2,500 of its nearly 6,500 worldwide stores in the United States.  Bain Capital, Carlyle Group Group and Thomas H.

31,MCD,Calorie labels change some diners' habits: study,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York City’s requirement that fast-food restaurants post calorie counts on menus led one in six customers to notice the information and buy foods with fewer calories, according to new research released on Tuesday.  While overall calorie consumption for the thousands of people tracked did not change, customers of McDonald’s, Au Bon Pain and Yum Brands Inc’s KFC were shown to make significant modifications, according to the study funded by the city of New York and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.  The report, published in the British Medical Journal, is one of the first to show a 2008 New York City law, requiring restaurant chains to prominently post calorie information, changed customer buying habits.  Advocates of the law see it as an important measure to help Americans lose weight, as more than two-thirds of the country’s citizens are overweight or obese, conditions linked to health problems like high blood pressure and diabetes.  “We think, overall, these initial findings are positive,” Dr. Lynn Silver, director of New York City’s Office of Science and Policy and co-author of the report, told Reuters.  “We’re optimistic, as calorie labels go national, and consumers become accustomed to using the information that chains will have a strong incentive to offer lower calorie options,” she said.  Restaurant chains have begun to include lighter fare on their menus to help customers cut down on fat, sugar and sodium intake. The report cited examples at sandwich chain Cosi, which began using low-fat mayonnaise in its sauces, while coffee chain Starbucks made low-fat milk as its default and Applebee’s introduced a menu with dishes under 550 calories.  All of these changes came after the New York calorie label law came into effect, the study said.  Separately on Tuesday, McDonald’s said it will soon cut the french fry servings in its children’s Happy Meals by more than half and add apple slices to every meal.  The New York city report surveyed the lunchtime crowd at 11 fast-food restaurant chains, looking at receipts for more than 7,300 people 12 months before the law took effect and for nearly 8,500 customers nine months after it was implemented.  For the three main restaurant chains studied, customers on average bought 44 fewer calories at McDonald’s, 80 fewer calories at Au Bon Pain and 59 fewer calories at KFC.  Subway, the popular sandwich chain, saw a significant increase during the survey because of its promotional offer for a $5, foot-long sandwich. The other chains saw little change in their customers’ purchases.  Earlier this year, a study published in the International Journal of Obesity, found New York City’s label law had little affect on the food children chose to order.  While both studies focus on New York City’s 2008 law, people across the country are keeping a close eye on the results.  President Barack Obama’s 2010 healthcare overhaul mandates a similar requirement nationwide in an effort to curb the U.S. obesity epidemic.  In 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that at least 20 percent of adults in all states, except Colorado, were obese. The CDC also said medical costs related to obesity were estimated to be as high as $147 billion in 2008.

35,MCD,"McDonald's Happy Meals get apples, fewer fries","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp said on Tuesday it will soon tweak its Happy Meals, reducing the french fry portion by more than half and automatically adding apples to the popular children’s meals, after coming under pressure from consumer groups to provide healthier fare.  McDonald’s — which has been taking heat from parents, consumer groups and local lawmakers over the nutritional content and marketing of Happy Meals — said it would start making the changes in September and the new Happy Meals would be available in all of its 14,000 U.S. restaurants by the end of the first quarter of 2012.  The world’s largest hamburger chain also plans a 15 percent reduction in sodium across its U.S. menu by 2015. Beyond that, it vowed to cut sodium, added sugars, saturated fats and calories in domestic meals by 2020.  “We are going to be casting our gaze more closely on portion management as well as how we can introduce more food groups such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains,” Cindy Goody, McDonald’s senior director of nutrition, said on a webcast.  The new child’s french fry portion will be 1.1 ounces, down from 2.4 ounces previously, and equal to about 100 calories.  McDonald’s currently offers apple slices with caramel dipping sauce as a Happy Meal side. The new apple portion size is 1.2 ounces, compared with 3.1 ounces previously, and has no added sugar or accompanying dipping sauces.  The new Happy Meals will have about 20 percent fewer calories than today’s most popular Happy Meal, executives said. As a result, the new Happy Meals will be under 600 calories.  Prices will not change as a result of the new composition, and toys will continue to be included in every Happy Meal, said Jan Field, McDonald’s U.S.A. president.  The move from McDonald’s came after San Francisco and nearby Santa Clara County, California, passed laws that would curb free toy giveaways with kids’ meals that did not meet nutritional requirements.  “Without the looming prospect of regulation in cities and states around the country, McDonald’s would not have taken as seriously the concerns that the public health community and parents have been sharing with them about this issue,” said Samantha Graff, director of legal research at Public Health Law & Policy, which drafted the models for the ordinances eventually adopted in Santa Clara County and San Francisco.  Field told Reuters that the changes announced on Tuesday were in the works for more than two years and had nothing to do with the Santa Clara County and San Francisco laws.  Field added that the new Happy Meals still would not meet San Francisco’s nutritional rules, which also require a vegetable serving.  Still, she said it is “absolutely” possible that McDonald’s could add a vegetable to Happy Meals over the next five years.  The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group that advocates healthier restaurant food for children, last year sued McDonald’s to stop it from using Happy Meal toys to lure children into its restaurants.  Some 1,700 health professionals and institutions also have signed an open letter to McDonald’s Chief Executive Jim Skinner calling for it to stop marketing junk food to kids.  CSPI’s nutrition policy director Margo Wootan, called the latest McDonald’s changes a step in the right direction.  “McDonald’s is an industry leader and Happy Meals have been copied by so many restaurants,” she said. “Having them change the nutritional quality for the Happy Meal sets a standard for the industry.”  Burger King Corp, DineEquity Inc’s IHOP and more than a dozen other restaurant chains earlier this month backed an industry effort to serve and promote healthier meals for children. McDonald’s said it supported that effort, from the National Restaurant Association.  As part of that, Burger King said it was removing french fries and soda as the default for its kids’ meals. Diners now have to choose between those options or sliced apples, fat-free milk or juice before an order can be completed.  While the restaurant industry is taking steps to appease its critics, it also has been backing laws designed to restrict local lawmakers’ ability to regulate restaurant marketing and other activities.  Shares in McDonald’s were up 4 cents to $88.16 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

38,MCD,Dunkin' Brands may raise more than $400 million in IPO,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Dunkin’ Brands Group this week plans to raise up to $400.5 million in an initial public offering that would help fuel the U.S. expansion of its Dunkin’ Donuts coffee brand.  The Canton, Massachusetts-based company wants to double the number of Dunkin’ Donuts outlets in the United States over the coming 20 years.  Dunkin’ Donuts has an extremely loyal following in the United States, where it touts itself as a seller of coffee for the working class. The chain lags bigger rival Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) when it comes to U.S. store numbers, but has successfully challenged its bigger rival in the grocery aisle.  Dunkin’ Brands, which also owns the Baskin-Robbins ice cream store brand, plans to sell 22.25 million IPO shares at $16 to $18 per share, according to a regulatory filing.  Pricing will be set on Tuesday evening and shares will begin trading on Wednesday, syndicate desks involved in the deal told Reuters.  Private equity firms Bain Capital, Carlyle Group CYL.UL Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners bought Dunkin’ Brands from global spirits company Pernod Ricard SA (PERP.PA) for $2.4 billion in 2006 and took it private.  If the IPO price lands at the range’s midpoint of $17 per share, Dunkin’ Brands’ market value would be about $2.15 billion.  Based on those figures, the company’s shares would trade at 3.7 times 2010 sales, a richer valuation than Starbucks, which at the close of trade on Monday traded at 2.8 times calendar 2010 sales.  “It’s a fairly high valuation, but I could make a case for buying the stock,” said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive and founder of YCMNET Advisors in Walnut Creek, California.  While Starbucks has built a global following selling fancy coffee drinks to relatively upscale consumers, Dunkin’ Donuts takes pride in its blue-collar clientele.  “Low-cost food products are going to do well in a more difficult economy,” said Yoshikami, who added that he prefers McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) — which has been expanding coffee sales through its McCafe program — over Dunkin’ Donuts.  Dunkin’ Donuts has a devoted following in the eastern United States, where almost 6,700 of its roughly 6,800 domestic outlets are located. The chain also has more than 3,000 international stores.  Yoshikami said Dunkin’ Donuts has huge potential, particularly on the East Coast.  The chain plans to focus on markets east of the Mississippi River, including Philadelphia, Chicago and South Florida. Longer term, it sees the western United States as a significant growth opportunity. Dunkin’ Donuts has about 100 stores in the region now.  Starbucks already has blanketed the United States with cafes. More than 11,000 of its 17,000 global cafes are located in the United States. As a result, its expansion is focused mainly on overseas markets like China.  The world’s biggest coffee chain stumbled when the U.S. slipped into recession. When Starbucks was busy restructuring its global business, Dunkin’ Donuts debuted its bagged coffee in U.S. supermarkets and drained market share from Starbucks.  The smaller company also had a successful advertising campaign featuring the slogan “America Runs on Dunkin’.”  Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys Inc, a consumer and brand loyalty consulting firm, called that campaign a coup for Dunkin’ Donuts, which has ranked No. 1 for customer loyalty and engagement in coffee over the past five years.  Starbucks ranks second, McDonald’s is third and Canadian chain Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO is fourth, Passikoff said.  During 2010, Dunkin’ Brands’ revenue was $577.1 million and its net income was $26.9 million.  Baskin-Robbins is the company’s more international brand, with just over 2,500 of its nearly 6,500 worldwide stores in the United States.  Bain Capital, Carlyle Group Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners are selling shares in the IPO, which would reduce their overall stake from about 32 percent to 26 percent.  Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay debt and fund operations.

39,MCD,Dunkin' Brands shares soar in stock market debut,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Investors eagerly bought the shares of Dunkin’ Donuts parent Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O), sending them up as much as 56 percent on their first day of trading on Wednesday.  The stock gained almost 47 percent to close at $27.85 after hitting an session high of $29.62 during its first day of Nasdaq trading.  The company’s new market value of more than $3.5 billion is still significantly smaller than rivals McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), but the Dunkin’ Donuts chain has a devoted U.S. following and plenty of room for domestic growth, particularly on the West Coast.  The chain, whose advertising slogan is “America Runs on Dunkin’,” has set a 20-year target for 15,000 U.S. stores — more than Starbucks’ 11,000 and up from about 6,800 currently.  “The market’s really going to like the growth story,” said Morningstar senior analyst Joscelyn MacKay. “Even though the Dunkin’ Donuts brand has been around for 70 years, there’s still great potential for the brand to increase its awareness around the United States.  Dunkin’ Donuts sells coffee drinks, doughnuts and other foods like bagels and sandwiches. It is the primary growth engine for Dunkin’ Brands, which gets 60 percent of its revenue from coffee.  Dunkin’ Donuts customers are the most loyal in the U.S. coffee business, ahead of fans of Starbucks, McDonald’s and Canadian chain Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO, according to consulting firm Brand Keys Inc.  Most Dunkin’ Donuts stores are on the East Coast, and the chain sees the U.S. West, where it has just over 100 outlets, as a key growth market.  Dunkin’ Donuts plans to steadily add stores across the United States “in a contiguous and disciplined manner,” Chief Executive Nigel Travis told Reuters.  That means it could take “some time” to get to California, the nation’s most populous state, which is already Dunkin Donuts’ biggest market for grocery sales of coffee, he said.  “When you can build another 3,000 stores relatively closer to where we already are, I think that’s the right decision to make,” said Travis.  The chain added more than 200 stores in the United States last year and plans to add 250 this year.  “We’re going to be extremely disciplined,” said Travis, who vowed that the brand would support its franchisees, who are key to profitable growth.  While Starbucks has built a global brand selling fancy coffee drinks to relatively upscale consumers, Dunkin’ Donuts takes pride in its more working-class clientele — a group also targeted by the expanded McDonald’s McCafe coffee drink lineup.  Dunkin’ Donuts also has opportunities to expand in international markets, where it now has 3,000 outlets.  Starbucks has saturated the domestic market and is focused on building more cafes overseas in markets such as China. McDonald’s, which has 14,000 restaurants in the United States, also is eyeing international growth.  The Baskin-Robbins ice cream chain is Dunkin’ Brands’ more international brand, with just over 2,500 of its nearly 6,500 worldwide stores in the United States. The chain contributes about one-fourth of company revenue, and its closely watched sales at established U.S. restaurants have been falling for some time.  Baskin-Robbins’ U.S. business is in the middle of a revival, and its same-restaurant sales are improving under new leadership, Travis said.  Canton, Massachusetts-based Dunkin’ Brands sold $422.75 million worth of stock on Tuesday in the biggest initial public offering of the week. The IPO price of $19 a share landed above the expected range of $16 to $18.  Morningstar’s MacKay said she wasn’t surprised to see the shares price above the expected range and pop in their first trading day, given that other popular restaurant chains are richly valued.  Her fair value estimate of $17 per share for Dunkin’ Brands implies a price-to-earnings ratio of around 24 times fiscal 2011 earnings. That compared with multiples of 50 for Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) and about 30 for both Panera Bread Co PNRA.O and Starbucks, she said.  Lawrence Levine, managing director at accounting firm RSM McGladrey, said the market is pricing Dunkin’ Brands and Starbucks nearly the same at an enterprise level — which he says is a better yardstick since Dunkin’ Brands has more debt than Starbucks and, unlike the world’s biggest cafe chain, does not own most of its stores.  Private equity firms Bain Capital, Carlyle Group CYL.UL and Thomas H. Lee Partners bought Dunkin’ Brands from global spirits company Pernod Ricard SA (PERP.PA) for $2.4 billion in 2006.  Those firms sold shares in the IPO, reducing their combined stake to 26 percent from 32 percent.  JPMorgan (JPM.N), Barclays Capital (BARC.L), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) were lead underwriters on the IPO.

The stock gained almost 47 percent to close at $27.85 after hitting an session high of $29.62 during its first day of Nasdaq trading.   The company’s new market value of more than $3.5 billion is still significantly smaller than rivals McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), but the Dunkin’ Donuts chain has a devoted U.S. following and plenty of room for domestic growth, particularly on the West Coast.   The chain, whose advertising slogan is “America Runs on Dunkin’,” has set a 20-year target for 15,000 U.S. stores — more than Starbucks’ 11,000 and up from about 6,800 currently.   “The market’s really going to like the growth story,” said Morningstar senior analyst Joscelyn MacKay. “Even though the Dunkin’ Donuts brand has been around for 70 years, there’s still great potential for the brand to increase its awareness around the United States.” (For Reuters BreakingViews commentary on the deal click [ID:nN1E76Q0EV])   Dunkin’ Donuts sells coffee drinks, doughnuts and other foods like bagels and sandwiches.

41,MCD,UPDATE 4-High prices keep diners away from PF Chang's," * EPS from cont ops 40 cents vs Wall St view 55 cents   * Same-store sales fall at both Bistro and Pei Wei   * Sees same-store sales down at both chains rest of year   * Sees higher labor costs, fall in restaurant oper income   * Shares fall 12 percent  (Adds profit outlook, rivals, analyst comments, bylines)   By Dhanya Skariachan and Lisa Baertlein   NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - P.F. Chang’s China Bistro Inc PFCB.O slashed its profit outlook and forecast a drop in same-restaurant sales at both its Bistro and Pei Wei chains as recently raised prices kept budget-conscious diners away.   The operator of P.F. Chang’s Asian-style bistro restaurants and the smaller Pei Wei quick-service chain also reported a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit and forecast a fall in restaurant operating income for 2011 on higher labor costs.   The news pushed its shares down more than 12 percent to $34.40 on Wednesday and prompted Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski to downgrade the company’s stock to “neutral” from “buy.”   “While the shares’ valuation may be attractive for value-oriented, patient shareholders, the stock should act as “dead money” for the near term at least,” Kalinowski said. “Simply put, there are better restaurant-stock investment ideas elsewhere.”   Scottsdale, Arizona-based P.F. Chang’s China Bistro recently raised menu prices 1 percent to 2 percent at the Bistro and 2 percent to 3 percent at Pei Wei.   Restaurant companies ranging from McDonald’s (MCD.N) to Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) are grappling with higher costs for key ingredients like beef and produce, and are cautiously raising prices to cover some of those extra expenses.   The higher prices are keeping diners away.   Sales at restaurants open at least 18 months fell 2.5 percent at the Bistro and 2.7 percent at the smaller Pei Wei quick-service chain in the second quarter. Based on recent trends, the company anticipates same-store sales declines of 2 percent to 3 percent at both chains for the rest of the year.   “We now know that the No. 1 sales challenge at both concepts relates to our entry-level price points,” Chairman and CEO Rick Federico said on a conference call.   “Many consumers have a strong affinity for our brand but (are) just finding them a bit too expensive for their everyday use,” he added.   The company now sees restaurant operating income falling about 120 basis points in fiscal 2011. It expects earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.70, down from its prior outlook of $2.15 to $2.20 a share.   Its earnings fell to $9.1 million, or 40 cents a share, in the second quarter, from $12.8 million, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier.   Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 55 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Revenue fell to $311 million from $312.8 million.   In March, eight Pei Wei restaurants in Arizona were closed after local authorities conducted an employment-related identity theft investigation. Those temporary store closures led to about $1.1 million in lost sales. [ID:nL3E7EM26Y]   The closures hurt closely watched same-restaurant sales in the first quarter.

Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.	   * Economists and analysts are trying to gauge the costs to the economy and consumers if the United States loses its solid-gold credit rating - a move that appears more likely now that the standoff in Washington over government spending has calcified.	   * Thanks to an inflow of tax payments and maneuvering by the Treasury Department, the government can probably continue to pay all of its bills for several days after Aug. 2, providing potentially critical breathing room for Congress to raise the debt ceiling, according to estimates by several Wall Street banks and a Washington research organization.	   * Bowing to pressure from health advocates and parents, McDonald’s is putting the Happy Meal on a diet. The company announced Tuesday that it would more than halve the amount of French fries and add fruit to its popular children’s meal in an effort to reduce the overall calorie count by 20 percent.	   * Two of Detroit’s Big Three, Ford and Chrysler, reported tepid second-quarter earnings on Tuesday, providing more evidence that the industry revival had slowed to a crawl.	   * George Soros, the investor who broke the Bank of England and came to represent the swashbuckling style of hedge fund managers and then their entry into the world of global affairs, has decided to return money to outside investors in his Quantum fund.	   * For a few years, fans have been able to log on to Hulu.com or Fox.com to watch what they missed on television the previous night. For most viewers, doing so is about to get a lot more difficult. Starting Aug. 15, the Fox network will limit next-day streaming of its shows to paying customers of approved cable and satellite distributors. 	   * The wave of relief in European markets that accompanied a new rescue plan for embattled euro zone governments appears to have mostly run its course, suggesting that investors are becoming more skeptical about the plan’s prospects for success.

The food chain that first ventured into France with an offer of burgers, french fries and milkshakes at the end of the 1970s, has made concessions to critics over the years by adding salads and fruit to its offering.	   Now it hopes to pander to tradition and add the waft of warm baguettes to the myriad other odours and attractions of its outlets in France.	   “For the first 15 years, from 1980, what we did above all was offer people a slice of America,” Nawfal Trabelsi, senior vice president for McDonald’s operations in France and southern Europe, told Le Figaro.	   Nowadays, the fast food chain was part of the everyday lives of French people and wanted to add a bigger French touch, he said.	   “The French are passionate about bread and crazy about baguettes,” Trabelsi said.	   French people eat nine sandwiches for every single burger they tuck into, according to an consultancy estimate, and most of those sandwiches are made with the traditional French baguette stick of bread, the newspaper said.

44,MCD,Dunkin' Brands shares soar in stock market debut,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Investors hungry for restaurant growth gobbled up shares in Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) on its Wednesday debut, betting its popular coffee-and-breakfast chain will outpace rivals like Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) in U.S. market growth.  Shares in Dunkin’ Brands jumped as much as 56 percent on their first day of trading and closed at $27.85 — a gain of 47 percent.  The company’s unpretentious Dunkin’ Donuts brand drives its growth, has devoted fans and has plenty of room for domestic expansion, particularly west of the Mississippi River.  But some analysts warn that bitter competition looms in the coffee and other beverage business that accounts for 60 percent of revenue at Dunkin’ Donuts.  “It’s soon to be a battle for share as opposed to taking advantage of a growth market,” said Bob Goldin, executive vice president at food consulting firm Technomic.  Goldin said that McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) — which has boosted profits of late by selling coffee, smoothies and other new drinks — also is a “hugely formidable” foe. Beyond that, he said, convenience stores all around the United States are expanding specialty coffee sales.  When the closing bell rang on Wall Street on Wednesday, Dunkin’ Brands had a market value of more than $3.5 billion.  “It’s a very rich multiple. They’re going to have to have a solid top and bottom line growth story to justify it,” Goldin said.

Dunkin’ Brands’ Chief Executive Nigel Travis told Reuters that he plans to steadily add Dunkin’ Donuts stores across the United States “in a contiguous and disciplined manner”.

Starbucks already has saturated the domestic market and is focused on building more cafes overseas in markets such as China.

46,MCD,McDonald's latest apple push makes suppliers happy," * Putting apples in all Happy Meals should help suppliers   * McDonald’s had fruit shortage during smoothie launch   * Potato suppliers may see reduction in fries sold   By Eunju Lie   CHICAGO, July 29 (Reuters) - Adding apples to all McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) Happy Meals starting in September is a healthy decision by the world’s largest hamburger chain — at least for apple suppliers.   Currently 10 percent to 12 percent of Happy Meals are sold with a side of apple slices as opposed to french fries, according to Mark Gedris, director of communications and membership at the U.S. Apple Association.    The apple portion of Happy Meals will shrink to 1.2 ounces from 3.1 ounces when the changeover occurs, but the supply of apples that McDonald’s will need will skyrocket since the number of the meals with apples will increase ten-fold.   McDonald’s will need to make sure that its apple supply keeps up with sales, or it could run into some problems as it did last summer with its McCafe Real Fruit Smoothies.   When McDonald’s launched the smoothies, it rescinded its giveaway of samples because of a shortage of fruit.   “With the smoothies, the results far exceeded anybody’s plans,” said Bob Goldin, executive vice president of Technomic.   This time, McDonald’s is likely to be more prepared.   “The apples go into a very predictable number of Happy Meals, so they’re really able to do some materials planning based on sales pattern,” Goldin said.   The Happy Meal has been a huge hit for McDonald’s, which declined to say just how many of the meals it sells.   The meals account for less than 10 percent of U.S. sales, according to McDonald’s spokeswoman Danya Proud.   Still, that’s a huge business, as McDonald’s posted $8.1 billion in U.S. sales in 2010.   Based on an estimated average price of $3.69 per Happy Meal, McDonald’s would have sold about 220 million of the meals in the United States last year. Of those, around 24 million Happy Meals were likely sold with apple slices, using the U.S. Apple Association’s finding that 10 percent to 12 percent are sold with apple slices.   The new Happy Meals should ultimately end up benefiting apple growers and processors.   “It’s wonderful for the apple suppliers ... big increase in their sales and demand,” said Goldin.   DOMEX Superfresh Growers, one of McDonald’s apple suppliers, should benefit “indirectly, by participating in the halo effect,” said Howard Nager, its vice president of marketing.   Tree Top, another apple supplier, declined to comment.   In addition to adding apple slices to all Happy Meals, McDonald’s is cutting the french fry portion by more than half. [ID:nN1E76P0LJ]   Slimming down the amount of fries served with Happy Meals could crimp McDonald’s main french fry suppliers, J.R. Simplot Co and McCain Foods Inc. However, McDonald’s is not expecting any change in its relationships with potato suppliers, according to Proud.   “If you think about the number of fries we sell, this will have a minimal impact, if any,” Proud said.   Simplot and McCain could not be reached for comment.

48,MCD,"UPDATE 5-Starbucks raises outlook, pins hopes on the affluent"," * Wealthier consumers more resilient to economy fears   * Shares up 1.3 percent in extended trade  (Adds analyst comment, details on Green Mountain)   By Lisa Baertlein   LOS ANGELES, July 28 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) raised its fiscal year forecast above Wall Street’s estimates, banking on its relatively well-heeled customers visiting more often and shaking off price increases.   The world’s biggest coffee chain, which is coming off a years-long restructuring that involved closing poorly performing stores to rekindle growth, on Thursday reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings.   Seattle-based Starbucks joined a raft of other premium-positioned companies — including burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) and Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O — in reporting out-sized same-store sales gains.   “The higher end is alive and well,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Larry Miller. Steakhouses and seafood restaurants also had strong results, he said.   “Reports of the consumer’s demise were greatly exaggerated,” said Miller, who added that McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and other restaurant chains showed surprising health during the latest quarter.   Sales at Starbucks’ U.S. cafes open at least 13 months, and which yield about four-fifths of its revenue, jumped 8 percent in its fiscal third-quarter ended July 3. Analysts expected a 5.3 percent increase.   Traffic in its home market climbed 6 percent, while average spending per visit rose 2 percent.   Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead told Reuters menu price increases accounted for the bigger part of the rise in spending, but customers were also buying more food.   Starbucks targets more affluent consumers than the typical U.S. fast-food chain. Those customers have fared better than their lower-income counterparts as the U.S. economy sputters, and they have resumed spending on discretionary items like $4 lattes and organic foods. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Graphic on shares vs coffee r.reuters.com/gyq82s  Chipotle earnings                       [ID:nN1E76I1KI]   Whole Foods earnings___________________ [ID:nN1E76P2FD] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>   CATERING TO THE WELL-HEELED   Starbucks shares, which have benefited from a massive restructuring that slashed costs and shut over 900 poorly performing cafes around the world, are up 60 percent from a year ago. On Thursday, it said it would be adding a net 800 stores globally in 2012.   That expansion comes despite high unemployment and the uncertain outcome of the U.S. debt ceiling debate weighing on the minds of consumers.   Upscale diners seem less wary. Chipotle, which offers naturally-raised meats and organic produce where possible, saw same-restaurant sales jump 10 percent in the most recent quarter. Whole Foods, top U.S. seller of organic food products, said its identical-store sales jumped 8.1 percent.   The gains at Starbucks, Chipotle and Whole Foods outpaced a 4.5 percent rise in U.S. same-restaurant sales at McDonald’s, one of the restaurant industry’s top performers and the leader among fast-food chains. [ID:nN1E76L03N]   “Our results are a little bit in contrast to what I still believe to be an uncertain and fragile environment out there,” Alstead said.   Wall Street also was upbeat about the coffee chain’s new partnership with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc GMCR.O, whose popular Keurig machines control about 80 percent of the fast-growing North American single-serve brewing segment.   The companies plan to begin selling Starbucks coffee and Tazo tea for Keurig machines at wholesale clubs, drugstores and supermarkets in North America this autumn, in time for the important winter holiday season.   Alstead said the partnership would generate 3 cents to 5 cents in incremental earnings per share in fiscal 2012.   Green Mountain shares soared more than 16 percent on Thursday, one day after it said that deals with the likes of Starbucks and newly public Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O) would brew up bigger profits. [ID:nL3E7IR4KH]   Seattle-based Starbucks boosted its earnings forecast for this fiscal year to $1.50-$1.51 per share from $1.46 to $1.48 a share, previously. Analysts, on average, were expecting a fiscal 2011 profit of $1.50 per share.   It also forecast a 15 percent to 20 percent increase in earnings per share in 2012 and a 10 percent increase in revenue. The forecast is based on mid-single digit comparable store sales growth and the opening of net 800 new stores.   The 2012 forecast includes the expected contribution from the Green Mountain deal.   Starbucks’ third-quarter net income rose 34 percent to $279.1 million, or 36 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 2 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 12 percent to $2.93 billion.   Shares were up 1.3 percent to $40.50 in after-hours trade. That gain came after the shares added 2.6 percent in regular Nasdaq trade on Thursday.

49,MCD,Reinvention helps L.A.'s foodie status soar,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters Life!) - Los Angeles’ restless and ever-changing food scene is hard to define, but it has forced U.S. diners to rethink their concept of what a restaurant is.  From hipster food trucks to exotic menu mashups and “pop-up” restaurants — reinvention is the theme that connects trend-setting chefs in the nation’s second-largest city that has a reputation as a culinary Wild West.  “L.A. really is the food city of the moment,” James Oseland, Saveur magazine’s editor-in-chief, told Reuters.  While San Francisco, New York and Chicago have well-defined food identities, Los Angeles’ vast, varied and undiluted ethnic food tradition makes it more difficult to pin down.  “The way the global food cultures casually converge in the place makes for a vigorous food culture that exists nowhere else on the planet,” said Oseland, who last year devoted a special issue to Los Angeles, dubbing it the ultimate food city.  “It is intensely ephemeral. It mirrors the basic sociology of the city,” he added.  The city’s best-known chefs are an unruly, unconventional bunch prone to abandoning gigs at five-star restaurants for more offbeat adventures.  Jonathan Gold, a native of L.A. and the first food reviewer to win a Pulitzer Prize, is more likely to visit family-run restaurants in immigrant enclaves than the entertainment industry’s latest hot spot.  Kogi Korean BBQ, a Korean taco truck that tweeted its way to international stardom in 2008, is the ultimate example of L.A.’s vibrant food culture.  It was the brainchild of chef Roy Choi, who was a toddler when his family immigrated to the United States from Korea and is now famous for launching the hipster food truck trend that took the United States by storm.  In merging Korean and Mexican fare, Choi put a fresh spin on the working-class “loncheros”, or lunch trucks, that have been a staple of L.A.’s bustling street food scene.  He also embraced new technology, networking with food bloggers and tweeting the truck’s planned stops.  Choi says L.A.’s non-native cooks are a hard-working and resourceful bunch who quietly have been shaping the city’s food culture since the sprawling city was just a pueblo.  “We’ve been breaking rules for 200 years ... We get resourceful and we do our thing,” said Choi, who now has four Kogi trucks and is starting work on his fourth restaurant.  Chef Ludo Lefebvre, who dazzled diners at some of the finest restaurants in France and Los Angeles with his blend of Old and New World cuisine, exchanged his chef whites for jeans and a T-shirt and started dining-room surfing.  “I wanted to break my image as a fine dining chef and be more accessible,” Lefebvre explained.  A stint as a guest chef at a friend’s eatery inspired what in 2007 became LudoBites, a “pop-up” restaurant, which opens for a brief time, often in a space owned by another operator.  LudoBites has been one of the hottest dining spots in L.A. Gold dubbed it “a hard-core democratization of cuisine” that is “harder to get into than the UCLA film school”.  Lefebvre describes LudoBites as a “touring restaurant” or a “traveling circus”.  “I’m scared to be stuck in the kitchen and not be able to travel. With LudoBites I can do my restaurant everywhere I want,” said Lefebvre, who is planning a stop in New York City.

51,MCD,"Dunkin' Donuts, Baskin-Robbins eye price increases","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) said on Wednesday its franchisees are raising prices at Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins stores to help cover the higher costs of key ingredients such as coffee and milk.  The shares of the company, which had its initial public offering last week, were down 4 percent after it also reported profits in the most recent quarter were down slightly from a year ago.  Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees raised some prices during the second quarter, largely due to the spike in coffee costs, Nigel Travis, chief executive of Dunkin’ Brands and president of Dunkin’ Donuts, said on a conference call.  “However, many of them chose not to raise coffee prices, but to focus price increases on our more differentiated products, such as breakfast sandwiches and cold beverages,” Travis said.  “For Baskin-Robbins, we anticipate ice cream dairy ingredients will remain at current high levels,” he said.  Owners of Baskin-Robbins ice cream shops plan to raise prices in the third quarter as the parent company also works to lower commodity costs by taking steps such as using secondary suppliers and negotiating contracts.  Dunkin’ Brands’ second-quarter net income slipped to $17.2 million from $17.3 million, a year earlier, while adjusted profit fell to $24.7 million from $25.6 million.  Revenue rose more than 4 percent to $157 million.  The Canton, Massachusetts-based company said same-store sales at all of its established U.S. stores were up 3.2 percent for the quarter.  That included a 3.8 percent rise at Dunkin’ Donuts, as customers spent more per visit, and a 2.8 percent drop at Baskin-Robbins, where sales were hurt by severe winter weather.  The U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts business accounts for the lion’s share of sales at Dunkin’ Brands.  Dunkin’ Donuts customers rank as the most loyal in the U.S. coffee segment, ahead of Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Canadian chain Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO, and the chain plans to more than double its U.S. outlets from roughly 6,800 over the next 20 years.  U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts stores have begun selling so-called “K-cups” filled with the brand’s coffee for use with Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc’s GMCR.O popular Keurig single-cup brewing machine. That product is expected to boost sales.  The K-cups will be available only at Dunkin’ Donuts stores, Travis said.  Dunkin’ Donuts, which sells coffee drinks and food such as bagels and breakfast sandwiches, also has more than 3,000 international stores.  Dunkin’ Brands made its debut as a publicly traded company last week and its shares jumped as much as 56 percent in their first day of trading.  Chief Financial Officer Neil Moses said the company used most of the proceeds from the IPO to pay down debt.  As a result, Moses said, Dunkin’ Brands reduced its debt to $1.5 billion from $1.88 billion and cut its annual interest expense by half to around $60 million.

53,MCD,Insight: CEOs warned: mind the pay gap,"LONDON (Reuters) - A stuttering economy and anemic profit growth means company bosses’ pay is unlikely to rise as fast this year as in 2010, but complaints from politicians and disgruntled shareholders over executive rewards are not going away.  If anything, the heat is increasing.  Britain, a traditional leader in corporate governance, is weighing new ways to rein in excessive salaries and bonuses; European and U.S. officials are aiming for more disclosure; and Australia has just passed tough new rules that could force board resignations.  In the good times, the man or woman in the street may not think too much about chief executives’ pay packets. Today, faced with an extended squeeze on real living standards, things feel very different.  Not surprisingly, the gap between the top and bottom on pay is biggest in the United States, where average CEO remuneration is 142 times that of employees, according to Thomson Reuters ASSET4 data. British CEOs pull in 69 times more than their workforces while egalitarian Sweden has an average differential of only 34 times.  After the hiatus of the recession, the gap between the boardroom and the shop floor is yawning wider.  “At a time of austerity, it does stand out as being particularly egregious,” said Deborah Hargreaves, chair of Britain’s independent High Pay Commission (HPC), set up by left-of-center pressure group Compass with backing from the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust.  If current trends continue, by 2030 wage disparity will reach levels of inequality not seen since Victorian times, her organization projects.  Perceived excesses, particularly in the banking sector, chime with politicians who are all too aware of simmering voter anger on the issue. The numbers certainly don’t look good.  Median compensation for CEOs at S&P 500 companies increased by 33 percent in 2010, according to International Shareholder Services, which advises investors on corporate governance.  In Britain, pay for leaders of FTSE 100 companies was up 32 percent, while workers’ pay increased just 2 percent, figures from pay consultancy MM&K and corporate governance group Manifest show.  And while this year’s pay increases may be lower, many CEOs still stand to benefit from share options granted in the depths of the downturn when stock prices were far lower.  Companies argue that pay policies are more tightly tied to performance than ever, but dissident shareholders — still a minority — are growing frustrated.  “This isn’t just about shareholders letting off a bit of steam. This is about shareholders having serious concerns about the linkage between strategy and stratospheric pay,” said Sarah Wilson, chief executive of Manifest.  In the United States, the Dodd-Frank corporate governance legislation — which has this year brought “say-on-pay” votes to annual meetings — is set to require firms to disclose the ratio of the CEO’s pay to that of the median of workers.  A simple ratio, however, can be a blunt instrument.  Goldman Sachs (GS.N), for example, emerges as the U.S. corporation with the flattest pay structure in the Thomson Reuters dataset, reflecting the fact it has thousands of high earners on its payroll. The investment bank typically distributes around 40 percent of its revenue in employee pay.  The biggest differentials — more than a thousandfold — are to be found at KFC parent Yum Brands (YUM.N) and McDonald’s (MCD.N), with their vast armies of low-paid chicken fryers and burger flippers.  In Europe, such huge differentials are less common, but the trend varies across the continent. British supermarket chain Tesco (TSCO.L) has a salary gap twice as large as that of German rival Metro MEOG.DE.  Germany’s two-tier management structure, with supervisory boards that include worker representatives overseeing the executive board, is a clear force for pay restraint.  “The workers keep things in check,” said a management pay consultant who declined to be identified.  British business minister Vince Cable — who has a fresh spring in his step after emerging as a rare winner in the News Corp (NWSA.O) scandal — has lashed out at the “ridiculous levels of remuneration” for company bosses and aims to take a targeted approach in a planned consultation process on changes to reporting standards.  At a meeting last week, he was urged by HPC to consider requiring companies to disclose how much of revenue goes to pay executives compared with dividend payouts, capital investment and total remuneration.  The rest of Europe is further behind. Still, the European Commission in April produced a discussion document on corporate governance asking if disclosure of boardroom pay and remuneration policy should be mandatory, and put to a vote by shareholders.  In Australia, a new “two strikes” rule implemented this month gives shareholders the right to replace a board if a quarter of votes oppose a company’s remuneration report in two successive years.  To date, shareholder action on executive pay has been limited. The first “say-on-pay” season in the United States, giving shareholders an advisory say on executive pay, has seen less than 2 percent of companies lose their votes.  But around one in six companies did get less than 80 percent shareholder support, according to a survey last week by consultancy Towers Watson, and those companies are now being forced to take the issue seriously.  In Britain, where voting on the remuneration report has been in place since 2003, the average level of dissent in shareholder votes at this year’s AGMs was 9.5 percent, according to Manifest.  Ironically, increased pay transparency may be a double-edged sword as boards jockey to benchmark against the competition.  “Boards seem to think it is a dereliction of duty or an admission that their chief executive isn’t quite up to it if they’re not being paid in the top quartile — but that just leads to an ever increasing ratchet up,” said HPC’s Hargreaves.

55,MCD,McDonald's global July same-store sales up 5.1 percent,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) reported a better-than-expected 5.1 percent rise in global July sales at established restaurants on Monday, as it takes share from rivals with low-priced food and new drinks.  Shares in McDonald’s were down 2.2 percent to $83.25 in midday trading, but still outperformed the broader market and its fast-food competitors.  During July, McDonald’s said it got a boost from sales of smoothies and other drinks in the United States and growth in its breakfast business in Europe.  While McDonald’s has been running a tight operational ship for many months, its major rivals are not faring as well.  “These guys are distancing themselves each and every day from the competition,” said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI was off 2.5 percent on Monday, as the entire market was hit in the first trading day since Standard & Poor's cut the U.S. credit rating.  McDonald’s “is outperforming its peer group and it’s outperforming the market,” Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matt DiFrisco told Reuters.  The world’s largest hamburger chain said sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 4.4 percent in the United States, 5.3 percent in Europe and 4.0 percent in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa.  The global result for July topped analysts’ average call for an increase of 4.6 percent, Jefferies & Co analyst Andy Barish said in a client note.  Europe fell short of analysts’ forecast for a rise of 6.6 percent. Strong results from Germany, Britain and Russia were partially offset by lighter trends in France, Barish said.  Europe is McDonald’s biggest sales driver, accounting for about 40 percent of total revenue.  McDonald’s relatively low prices have helped attract customers in both the United States and Europe as the economy remains weak in those regions.  Wall Street has high expectations for McDonald’s, which has been posting sales and profits that are the envy of the global fast-food industry.  The Oak Brook, Illinois-based company has been using menu changes, such as adding coffee and other drinks and expanding its offerings of $1 food items, to broaden its appeal beyond the young men who account for the biggest share of sales at most other fast-food chains.  Meanwhile, Yum Brands Inc’s (YUM.N) Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut fast-food chains are struggling in the United States.  Hamburger rival Wendy’s Co WEN.N just sold its Arby’s sandwich chain, while Burger King Corp BKCBK.UL sold itself to a private equity firm.  Shares in Wendy’s fell 3.7 percent on Monday.

57,MCD,Junk food still star in TV ads seen by children: study," NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters Life!) - Children in the United States are seeing fewer sugary, fatty foods advertised on TV, but unhealthy fare still accounts for most of the food ads they see — and fast food commercials were more numerous in 2009 than six years before, a study said.	   The U.S. food industry in 2006 began a voluntary program called the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) in response to calls from the Federal Trade Commission and the Institute of Medicine for greater self-regulation of food advertising to children.	   The study, reported in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, assessed the impact of the program, which 17 companies — including Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods, General Mills and Kellogg — have joined, pledging to improve the nutritional content of the ads they run during programs geared mainly for children under 12.	   “Overall, fewer of these (unhealthy) products were being advertised, which is good news,” said Lisa Powell, a researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who led the study.	   “On the other hand, we saw a large increase in the number of fast-food ads.”	   The extent to which advertising is to blame for childhood obesity is controversial, but there is evidence that commercials may affect children’s hunger for junk food. One recent study found that children watching cartoons consumed 45 percent more snacks when they were exposed to food ads.	   The study looked not only at ads aired during children’s programs, but all commercials seen by the under-12 set, based on Nielsen ratings data.	   By 2009, children were seeing fewer high-fat, high-sugar or high-sodium foods in TV ads, compared with 2003. But the bulk of 2009 ads, at 86 percent, were for fatty, sugary or salty products — down from 94 percent in 2003.	   Children also saw roughly one third more fast-food commercials in 2009.	   Powell said the results raise questions about the extent to which self-regulation of ads during children’s programming can “change the landscape” of food marketing to children.	   Lee Peeler, a spokesperson for the Council of Better Business Bureaus, which runs the CFBAI, said the study shows that progress has been made.	   But he took issue with the fact that the study looked at all ads seen by children, rather than ads aired during children’s programming, which are the focus of the CFBAI initiative.	   “They didn’t use the right measure of industry self-regulation,” he added.	   He also said that researchers only looked at the number of fast-food ads and not the content, noting that two giants of the industry — Burger King and McDonald’s, both of which are CFBAI members — have improved their children’s meals and the ads for them, offering things such as apple slices and low-fat milk instead of French fries and soda.	   Powell said that the CFBAI has made some recent changes that could be for the better, such as announcing that it had developed uniform nutrition criteria, based on U.S. dietary guidelines, for foods that can be advertised to children.	   The uniform criteria will go into effect in 2014 and include standards such as limiting advertised children’s cereals to 10 grams of sugar per serving, down from the 12 grams companies are holding themselves to now.	   Currently, companies are able to create their own standards.	   “We may well see some improvements in the future,” Powell said, noting that parents need to be aware that junk foods still feature heavily in TV ads.	   ""Time will tell. We'll have to keep monitoring this.""

58,MCD,"UPDATE 4-Tim Hortons profit rises, paced by U.S. sales"," * EPS C$0.58 vs C$0.54 year-ago; revenue up 10 pct   * Same-store sales up 3.8 pct in Canada, 6.6 pct in U.S.   * Board in early stage of CEO search, says chairman   * Company plans aggressive U.S. expansion   * Shares up 1.2 pct in Toronto, up 2.3 pct in New York  (Adds chairman interview)   By S. John Tilak   TORONTO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Tim Hortons Inc’s THI.TO THI.N profit rose 1.5 percent as Canada’s largest restaurant chain benefited from strong U.S. sales and passed along higher coffee costs to its customers, sending its shares higher.   The outperformance in the United States, a smaller market for the company than Canada, was a sign that the retailer was finally making headway in the cutthroat market.   Tim Hortons has invested heavily in advertising campaigns and promotions in the United States, where consumers are only starting to get familiar with a brand that is a household name north of the border.   Investors are focused on the lucrative U.S. market as it has the potential to become bigger than Canada, where the Tim Hortons name is virtually synonymous with coffee. [ID:nN13121814]   Sales at its established stores rose 3.8 percent in Canada, where price increases helped and it introduced fruit smoothies and other new products.   In the United States, same-store sales rose 6.6 percent, helped by advertising campaigns that increased visibility.   “The performance in the United States was outstanding,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. The U.S. same-store sales growth was one of the strongest — if not the strongest — in the North American quick-service industry, he added.   Tim Hortons has in the past struggled to replicate its Canadian success in the United States, where it has had to pull back and shut stores. It is now primarily focused on nine U.S. states, including New York, Michigan and Pennsylvania.   “We plan to go about aggressively opening new stores,” Executive Chairman Paul House said of the company’s plans in the United States, which he said was a growth market.   “We’re getting more and more name recognition everyday,” he said in an interview with Reuters.   Second-quarter earnings rose to C$95.5 million ($95.5 million), or 58 Canadian cents a share, from C$94.1 million, or 54 Canadian cents a share, a year ago. The results included a 3-cent charge due to expenses related to the CEO departure.   Excluding the charge, the company would have met market estimates of 61 Canadian cents a share.   Revenue rose 10 percent to C$702.8 million, compared with the average analyst estimate of C$708.5 million.   The company is yet to announce a replacement for former Chief Executive Donald Schroeder, who left abruptly in May.   “You don’t like to go through what we went through. But we’re in good terms with Don,” said House, who is also serving as the interim CEO.   The board is in the very early stage of the CEO search but has made progress, House said, declining to offer a timeline.   International experience is a nice-to-have but not essential on the new CEO’s resume, House said.   “You want someone that can fit the culture. We don’t want someone to come in and try to fix a broken company, because it’s not (one),” he told Reuters.   “It’s highly likely that the person will have great knowledge of the U.S. market,” he said.   The business continues to chug along with little impact from Schroeder’s exit, and the company will keep passing on the price increases to its customers, Yarbrough said.   “Price increases are the nature of the beast that will continue,” he said.   Tim Hortons competes with McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O), Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and Second Cup (SCU.TO), a Canadian coffee shop chain.   The company’s stock was up 1.2 percent at C$44.13 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and up 2.3 percent at $44.45 on the New York Stock Exchange.

59,MCD,China sells retail bonds in offshore yuan mkt at 1.6 pct," HONG KONG, Aug 17 (Reuters) - China’s Ministry of Finance sold a five billion yuan retail tranche of a 20 billion yuan ($3.13 billion) offer at 1.6 percent, the same as a previous sale in November as Beijing takes more steps to deepen the offshore renminbi bond market.	   The bond tender was the biggest so far by a single issuer in the growing offshore yuan market and received heavy demand from investors hungry to buy yuan-linked assets.     	   Since landmark reforms in July 2010 allowed banks in Hong Kong to freely trade renminbi, trade settled in China’s currency has grown by six times. Yuan-settled trade accounted for 7 percent of China’s total trade in the March quarter compared with less than 1 percent in the prior year.	   The growth in offshore yuan trade settlement has boosted the development of a so-called “CNH” market in Hong Kong.	   Big name foreign borrowers, including the World Bank, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), McDonald’s Corp and Caterpillar  , have sold yuan-denominated bonds, or “dim sum” bonds, as they are more colorfully known after a local delicacy. 	   As of the end of last week, 88 billion yuan ($13.7 billion) worth of dim sum bonds had been issued in 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data, compared with 42.6 billion yuan worth during all of 2010.

60,MCD,HOW TO PLAY IT: Market turmoil shakes up investor options," THE ISSUE: Three weeks of roller-coaster equity markets have left many investors exhausted and financial advisers searching for answers. We talked to some advisers about real-world options, geared to clients’ risk tolerance.   By Joseph A. Giannone and Jessica Toonkel   NEW YORK, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Income-generating stocks and bonds can provide stability and reassurance during volatile periods.   Andrew Morse, a veteran broker at HighTower Advisors LLC in New York, steers some of his affluent clients toward dividend-paying companies with modest debt loads and operations in faster-growing regions such as Asia.   One such company is McDonald’s Corp. (MCD.N), the $88 billion fast-food giant that pays a nearly 3 percent dividend yield and in July beat estimates by reporting a 5 percent rise in sales.   Todd Morgan, senior managing partner of Bel Air Investment Advisors in Los Angeles, says many of his clients had moved assets to cash and bonds ahead of the recent downturn. That allowed them to redeployed into high-dividend stocks at discounted prices last week.   Investors could do well, he said, with blue chips like Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) shares, each of which yields more than Treasury bonds.   “What would you rather own for the next 10 years?,” asks Morgan, whose firm oversees $6.5 billion.   P&G shares yield 3.45 percent, while Johnson & Johnson stock pays 3.6 percent. By comparison, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was yielding 2.1 percent on Friday.   Investors averse to stock-picking might embrace vehicles such as the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (SDY.P), a passive fund comprised of dividend paying stocks, or the Manning & Napier Dividend Focus mutual fund (MNDFX.O).   The mutual fund is down nearly 10 percent since July 22, and the S&P Dividend ETF is down 12 percent in the same period, smaller declines than the 16 percent drop in the S&P 500 Index.   Exchange-traded funds are generally thought of as efficient vehicles for both small and large players to play the market.   Taking a short position on the $2.7 billion iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG.P) could be a good strategy to profit from Europe’s fiscal woes, said Paul Justice, an ETF analyst at Morningstar.   “Germany is export-driven and if Europe continues to suffer, Germany will suffer disproportionately,” he said.   Investors bearish on the United States and its financial services companies may want to short the $4.8 billion Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF.P), which sank 21 percent in the past month, he said.   Those who expect market volatility to persist can purchase securities based on the CBOE’s Market Volatility Index, such as the $1.3 billion iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures exchange-traded note (VXX.P) The index has roughly doubled since July 22, when the recent market swoon began.   Advisers and clients with a real taste for risk can try leveraged and inverse ETFs, said Tom Lydon, president of Global Trends Investments, an adviser managing $95 million.   “These are for people who are watching the markets every day,” he said. “You can’t just buy them and hold on because they don’t correlate exactly to the market over long periods.”   The Securities and Exchange Commission, FINRA and state securities regulators have issued warnings about the dangers of owning leveraged or inverse ETFs, which amplify risks by using debt and derivatives.   Advisers said it’s important to discuss investments in difficult times.   “Clients are starting to understand that abnormal is normal,” said Howard Sontag, whose New York-based Sontag Advisory LLC manages $5 billion in assets for super-wealthy families. “We cannot control market volatility, but we can build a portfolio that gives our clients some comfort.”  ",8192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/brokers-investing/how-to-play-it-market-turmoil-shakes-up-investor-options-idUSN1E77I0CS20110819
61,MCD,Insight: The madness of Wall Street,"By Matthew Goldstein, Lauren Tara LaCapra, Jennifer Ablan and Joseph Giannone  NEW YORK (Reuters) - The best thing to be said of the recent stomach-churning turmoil on Wall Street is that it’s taking place in August, a time of year when many people are lounging at the beach or camping in the woods and not paying attention to stocks.  But for everyone else not on a ‘stockation,’ watching the markets rise and fall like giant ocean swells has been an unnerving experience that some finance professionals worry could reshape investor behavior for months and years to come.  “Everyone felt this was idiotic,” says Susan Kaplan, president of Kaplan Financial Services, referring to last week’s volatility. “Most clients didn’t want to deal with the markets anymore and went back to their summer vacations,” said Kaplan, whose firm manages about $1.3 billion in customer money.  In the short term, doing nothing may well prove to be the best strategy for dealing with the kind of dizzying gyrations that occurred the week of August 8 in the U.S. stock market. At one point, the S&P500 was down 8 percent for the week before it erased all of those losses and then some in the ensuing days.  Thursday brought another August storm. The S&P500 plunged 4.46 percent and the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield fell below 2 percent for the first time in 70 years. And the trouble is this turmoil may not be some temporary anomaly.  Experts say investors should expect even more volatility in stocks, as herd trading by hedge funds, knee-jerk trader reaction to news and lightning fast computer programs combine to make for a new and uncomfortable normal on Wall Street.  This new trading frontier even has its own signature milepost, something called “a liquidity black hole.” It’s a trading phenomenon in which there’s so much intense selling pressure in big-cap stocks that it sucks all the oxygen out of the market and stocks plunge precipitously - as on August 8 when every single stock in the S&P500 ended the day in the red.  “We have to be aware that we can be hit by one of these liquidity black holes with ever increasing frequency,” says G. Andrew Karolyi, a finance professor at Cornell University Johnson Graduate School of Management. If you are a long-term buy and hold investor you better be aware of these and not panic when you see it.”  Yet some fear that’s just what ordinary investors will do as this new hair-trigger trading dynamic becomes more common. There’s a concern that frenzied trading could drive people further away from stocks at a time when, other than gold, there are few assets generating any kind of substantial return.  And that’s something that could have long-term ramifications for the ability of investors to build retirement nest-eggs, especially given the historic poor ability of retail investors to time market swoons and surges. A portfolio with 20 percent in cash, 50 percent in a bond fund yielding 3.42 percent a year and 30 percent in stocks isn’t going to enable a person in their 50s to retire any time soon.  Also if investors flee stocks it could make it harder for small, niche companies, such as ones in the biotech or clean energy sectors, to tap the public markets for capital. Or more of those companies might take their capital-raising business overseas to places like Hong Kong, which would be another blow to Wall Street.  “The market we are operating in is markedly different from five years ago,” says Andrew Lo, a professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management, who frequently writes on hedge fund trading strategies and markets. “We are seeing extraordinary emotional reactions from central banks, politicians, regulators and investors. That kind of reaction is not conducive for building long-term wealth. We have an environment that is highly unstable.”  One might say Wall Street is a bipolar market that veers from despair to euphoria with each passing news headline.  Over the past several weeks, stocks prices have swung widely based on a range of factors: the perceived progress of European leaders in dealing with the eurozone debt crisis; the fears of a double-dip recession in the United States; the fallout from Standard & Poor’s downgrade of U.S. debt; and whether the Federal Reserve will embrace a new round of easy money to jumpstart the economy.  L. Randall Wray, a professor of economics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, says much daily trading in stocks is like a self-fulfilling prophecy. “What matters is what the markets think not what people in the markets believe,” says Wray. “Traders are constantly trying to guess how daily events might affect other market participants.”  This guessing game is largely being driven by super-fast computers with algorithmic programs designed to react to headlines and overall market trading patterns. The Tabb Group, a financial markets’ research firm, estimates that during the frenetic week of August 8, high-frequency trading firms and strategies accounted for 65 percent of the daily trading volume in the United States.  The power of the machines over trading is one reason why technical analysis, often pooh-poohed as Wall Street alchemy, is gaining more believers among traders. There’s more interest than ever in computer programmers who can write algos to simply buy and sell stocks whenever the S&P hits a predetermined target, or some bizarrely-named trading pattern such as a “Death Cross” forms on screens.  Some of the surge in volatility is also attributed to a growing legion of money managers who frequently trade exchange-traded funds - which are baskets of stocks, indexes and other assets - as a way to hedge their positions.  “There’s a different dynamic now because of the pervasiveness of high-frequency traders and hedge funds,” says John Longo, chief investment strategist at MDE Group, which manages $1.3 billion in assets. Longo, also a finance professor at Rutgers Business School in New Jersey, adds: “The down-5-percent one day, up-5-percent the next day volatility wouldn’t have happened in the past.”  The trouble for ordinary investors is that there are no good market forecasts for predicting what might spark a liquidity black hole. Fear about the United States and European countries slipping back into recession is a legitimate concern that could have real impact on corporate profits and stocks. But when traders act on those fears at lightning speed it can result in seemingly irrational sell-offs.  Take the scary 6.66 percent drop in the S&P500 on August 8. On that first trading day after the credit rating arm of S&P stripped the U.S. of its vaunted Triple AAA debt rating, all 500 stocks in the index closed the day in the red.  The selling was so ferocious that shares of McDonald’s Corp, for instance, fell 3.5 percent to $82.11, even though the fast-food giant reported a 5.1 percent climb in same-store sales for July, higher than analysts had expected.  Such selling with no regard to corporate fundamentals makes the notion of stock picking seem quaint.  Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management, with $18 billion in assets, says the indiscriminate selling means “good stocks are going down at the same pace as bad stocks.”  Karolyi says the waves of wholesale selling driven by liquidity black holes are not just the byproduct of the over-computerization of trading, it’s the end result of too much “group think” by institutional traders.  He says Wall Street first saw this in August 2007, when dozens of quant hedge funds suffered big losses at the start of the financial crisis because the algos they employed were all buying and selling the same securities. This flawed thinking by some of Wall Street’s brightest math geeks was an early warning sign of even worse group think to come with regards to the value of securities backed by subprime mortgages.  Karolyi says his research, which will be officially published later this year in The Journal of Financial Economics, has found the phenomenon of liquidity black holes is spreading beyond the U.S. to other stock markets. That is problematic because the effects of liquidity black holes can be profound.  Critics of high-frequency trading firms argue that the May 6, 2010 “flash crash,” in which the Dow Jones Industrials plunged 1,000 points in less than 20 minutes, was caused in part by an absence of liquidity or traders making markets in stocks. While securities regulators have never identified a single cause for the flash crash, they have noted that the rapid collapse of stock prices was exacerbated by some high-frequency trading firms turning off their computers and not making trades.  Some are starting to worry about the impact on ordinary investors of the rise of the machines and all these unforeseen consequences. These Wall Street professionals wonder whether events like the flash crash and the frenzied trading of this month will push average investors further away from stocks and into low-yielding money market funds and bond funds.  “The last 10 years have been a nightmare in this business,” says Dave D’Amico, president and chief market strategist at Braver Capital Management, which has $575 million in customer money. “People distrust Wall Street at one of the highest rates I can remember.”  Evidence of that distrust is already apparent. Over the past two weeks, retail investors pulled $17.4 billion out of U.S. equity mutual funds, according to Lipper, a mutual fund information service. Investors have been backing away from stocks for some time, with many retail investors missing out on a sizable chunk of the 5,000 point surge in the Dow Jones Industrials since the markets bottomed in March 2009.  According to Strategic Insight, a mutual fund consulting firm, stock mutual funds in 2009 took in about $85 billion as the markets were beginning to rise. In comparison, a record $425 billion was invested in low-yielding bond mutual funds.  This trend of retail investors preferring bonds over stocks continues to this day, even as the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury hit 1.98 percent on Thursday. In 2010, investors added $222 billion more to bond funds than they withdrew. Yet despite an average 17 percent return last year for the average U.S. stock fund, retail investors took more money out of those funds than they put in, according to Strategic Insight.  “Americans are scarred by the devastating market crash of 2008,” said Tom Roseen, senior research analyst at Lipper. “The gut wrenching losses of this period are still fresh in everyone’s mind.”  The tumultuous trading of August will only reinforce those painful memories.  Retail investors have notoriously bad timing. For the 17th time in as many years, Boston-based research firm DALBAR found that the 20-year returns realized by mutual fund investors lagged the markets thanks to ill-timed buys and sells driven by psychology. “At no point in time have average investors remained invested for a sufficiently long enough period to derive the benefits of a long-term investment strategy,” DALBAR wrote in its 2011 investor behavior analysis.  Nonetheless retail investors, via their stock mutual funds, own a sizable chunk of America’s publicly-traded companies. Strategic Insight reports that U.S. mutual funds and exchange-trade funds hold $4 trillion in U.S. stocks, or 27.7 percent of the total U.S. market capitalization.  Wall Street investment firms, of course, have a big stake in dissuading investors from turning their back on stocks or mutual funds. That’s especially true for a big retail brokerage firm like Charles Schwab, which has marketed itself as a place for individuals to control their financial destinies.  Walter Bettinger, Schwab’s chief executive officer, concedes that the current market turmoil will prove difficult for the online brokerage’s less experienced customers.  “If someone’s idea of investing is sitting in front of their computer without a strategy, of seeking gains through trading against machines making millions of trades a second, that’s a tough row to hoe,” says Bettinger.  He says the largest online investment firm is trying to move more of its customers to a mix of do-it-yourself investing and guidance from a financial consultant. He expects that to be an easier sell if extreme volatility continues.  The danger for Schwab and all of Wall Street is retail investors become ever more cautious and simply sit in cash, Treasuries and low-yielding bond funds.  And the danger for retail investors is they end up forsaking stocks and start seeking higher-yields in speculative investments that promise returns too good to believe.

64,MCD,Dunkin' Brands shares are pricey -Barron's," NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc’s (DNKN.O) shares are too expensive given its growth prospects, financial weekly Barron’s said in its Aug. 29 issue.   The operator of Dunkin’ Donuts is still mostly a breakfast-oriented, regional chain, curbing its expansion potential, Barron’s wrote.   Shares of Dunkin’ Brands, which also operates Baskin-Robbins, closed at $26.28 on Friday on the Nasdaq Stock Market, meaning they are pricier than those of Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and DineEquity (DIN.N) on a price-to-earnings per share basis, Barron’s said.   Dunkin’ Brands went public last month and its shares sold for $19 in its initial public offering.

65,MCD,UPDATE 1-China Citic Bank unveils jumbo CNH bond offer," * Total offer of 30 bln yuan unlikely to be in single tranche   * More issuers seen after recent policy moves to boost market   (Adds background)	   By Soo Ai Peng	   SHANGHAI, Aug 30 (Reuters) - China Citic Bank Corp Ltd   plans to sell up to $4.7 billion in offshore yuan-denominated bonds by 2013, indicating that issuers are lining up to sell debt in the territory after the authorities unveiled fresh reforms this month.	   While Chinese banks have long been issuers of short-dated paper in this market in the form of certificates of deposit, the bond deals point to a growing ability of the offshore yuan market in Hong Kong to absorb large sizes.	   Citic did not say in how many tranches it would sell the bonds, although analysts said it was likely to be multiple rather than a single tranche issue.	   The lender’s board of directors had approved a debt programme totalling 30 billion yuan consisting of maturities of no more than five years, it said in a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange late on Monday.     	   The funds raised would be channeled into its loan business and other corporate activity, it said.	   Citic’s announcement comes days after China’s Ministry of Finance sold 20 billion yuan ($3.13 billion) of offshore bonds, the biggest renminbi-denominated deal ever and as Vice-Premier Li Keqiang unveiled fresh measures to boost the growth of the CNH market.	   More Chinese companies will be allowed to issue so-called ‘dim-sum’ bonds, rather than only financial institutions and foreign companies previously.	   Beijing also plans to create a transparent framework to remit yuan bonds to China, a departure from its current policy of allowing remittances on a case-by-case basis, a policy that will give a shot in the arm to the growing line of issuers.  	   Demand for yuan exposure in Hong Kong, where renminbi in bank deposits far outstrip the amount of assets available, and expectations that Beijing will allow a more rapid appreciation of its currency have helped boost the CNH market.	   As of late-August, 112 billion yuan ($17.55 billion) worth of dim sum bonds had been issued in 2011, according to Thomson Reuters data, nearly three times the amount issued in the whole of 2010.  	   Big-name foreign borrowers, including the World Bank, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), McDonald’s Corp and Caterpillar Inc , have sold dim-sum bonds joining mainland and Hong Kong issuers.

66,MCD,China liquor maker jacks up prices by 30 pct," BEIJING, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Chinese liquor maker Wuliangye  will raise prices for its alcohol by 20-30 percent from Sept 10, the firm said, the latest company to lift retail prices amid stubborn inflation pressures.	   The official Xinhua news agency cited Wuliangye officials as saying that the price increase reflects strong demand and rising costs for raw materials, labour and transport.	   Liquor is often served at lavish Chinese dinners.	   Wuliangye is not alone in raising prices. Other firms that have recently raised prices or announced plans to do so include China’s biggest steel maker, Baoshan Iron & Steel , and the country’s top dairy product maker, China Mengniu Dairy Co as well as foreign fast food chain McDonald’s  and consumer product giant Unilever Plc  (UNc.AS).	   Even as China’s economy slows, Beijing is still targeting inflation, which ran at three-year highs of 6.5 percent in July, as among its top policy priorities. 	   It stepped up restrictions on bank lending last week, and China’s top economic planner said on Monday that inflation pressures stayed high in the world’s No. 2 economy.

68,MCD,UPDATE 3-McDonald's to spend $1 bln to update Canada stores," * To remodel majority of restaurants by year-end   * Sees double-digit sales growth as a result of overhaul   * McDonald’s, Tim Hortons compete more closely  (Adds background, comments from executive and analyst)   By S. John Tilak   TORONTO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) will spend $1 billion renovating its stores in Canada, the restaurant chain said on Wednesday, as competition with Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO heats up.   The Canadian unit of the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company, which has been operating for 44 years, plans to refurbish most of its 1,400 restaurants by the end of 2012, with more than half finished by the end of this year.   McDonald’s has been outperforming its fast-food rivals globally, reaping the benefits of broadening its low-cost food menu, introducing premium items such as espresso-based coffee, and sprucing up its restaurants.   The company plans new exterior and interior designs in Canada, including fireplaces and flat-screen televisions in some stores. It expects the changes to encourage customers to linger and make more purchases.   “We’re in the midst of a brand transformation. It’s time to make our restaurants more contemporary and comfortable,” John Betts, chief executive of McDonald’s Canada, said in an interview.   He said the renovations are also aimed at increasing the chain’s capacity to serve customers its expanded menu. He sees close to double-digit sales growth at the restaurants when the changes are complete.    The news comes as McDonald’s has been promoting its coffee aggressively, while Tim Hortons, Canada’s No. 1 coffee-and-doughnuts chain, has been beefing up its food line-up.   McDonald’s has doubled its coffee business in Canada in the last two years, and its breakfast business has grown by 40 percent in the last three years, Betts said. It has given away 15 million cups of free coffee, drawing in more breakfast customers, he said.   Tim Hortons continues to dominate breakfast sales, however, while McDonald’s has a slim lead in the lunch category.   The revamp will have a negligible impact on Tim Hortons, though McDonald’s could take share from other players, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.   Tim Hortons does not want its customers to linger in its restaurants and that strategy is working well for the company, said Yarbrough, who added he sees little need for Tim Hortons to respond to the McDonald’s move.   Oakville, Ontario-based Tim Hortons is now targeting the U.S. market, where it is investing heavily in marketing and promotions. It reported strong quarterly U.S. sales last month.   Shares of Tim Hortons, which has almost 3,200 restaurants in Canada, were up 1 percent at C$46.30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday afternoon. McDonald’s shares were up 0.3 percent at $89.05 on the New York Stock Exchange.  (Reporting by S.

The company is following a small but growing number of Western multinationals into the so-called “dim sum” market.   The amount raised — 1.75 billion yuan ($274 million) — is relatively small, but Air Liquide said it marked a diversification of funding sources and showed international investor confidence in the group.   “The bond proceeds will contribute to the financing of the development of Air Liquide’s activities in China,” the company said. It employs more than 3,500 staff and operates more than 40 plants in China, a market that helped buoy its first-half 2011 results despite Japan’s earthquake and turmoil in North Africa. [ID:nLDE77001W]   As of July, only five foreign multinationals had tapped the “dim sum” market: McDonald’s (MCD.N), Caterpillar (CAT.N), Unilever (UNc.AS), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Fonterra.

71,MCD,Wall Street tumbles as ECB discord stirs broad fears,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks tumbled more than 2 percent on Friday after the top German official at the European Central Bank resigned in protest of the bank’s bond-buying program, which has been a major tool in fighting the region’s debt crisis.  The resignation of Juergen Stark from the ECB throws into question policymakers’ ability to deal with Europe’s debt crisis, a problem that could engulf a world economy already teetering on the brink of recession.  Investors’ rising fears were highlighted by a 12 percent jump in the market’s main measure of expected turbulence, the VIX volatility index .VIX. The VIX neared 40, close to its highest level this year, as it marked its biggest jump in three weeks.  “Stark’s resignation is suggesting that there is a lot of pressure being built in the senior levels in the ECB,” said James Dailey, portfolio manager of TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. “There is an increasing realization that this is a major solvency issue in the banking system.”  Doubts about President Barack Obama’s $447 billion stimulus proposal added to the negative sentiment, with investors unconvinced his administration has the tools to revive the flagging U.S. economy.  The sell-off was broad and on solid volume. All 10 S&P sectors were in the red and more than 80 percent of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange fell. There were 8.7 billion shares traded on the NYSE, the Nasdaq and the Amex, above the exchanges’ 20-day moving average.  Unnerving traders further were unconfirmed terrorism threats against New York City and Washington just ahead of the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.  “There is an extreme amount of negativity,” said Sam Ginzburg, a senior trader at First New York Securities.  “In talking to the sell-side desks that we do business with, they’re not telling me that there are long-onlys adding to or initiating positions right now,” he said.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 303.68 points, or 2.69 percent, to 10,992.13. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX dropped 31.67 points, or 2.67 percent, to 1,154.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC dropped 61.15 points, or 2.42 percent, to 2,467.99.  The ECB has been buying up sovereign bonds to help hold down borrowing costs in some debt-strapped euro zone members, and the program has been considered critical to arresting market contagion. The resignation of Stark, who will step down by the end of the year, may deepen the gulf between the ECB and German guardians of central banking orthodoxy.  At a meeting of finance chiefs from the Group of Seven wealthy nations being held in France, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Friday pressed Europe’s strongest economies to give “unequivocal” financial support to weaker euro zone states to overcome a debt crisis that threatens the world economy.  The S&P 500 ended the week 1.7 percent lower and is now down 8.2 percent this year.  Shares of some big companies fell after Obama’s speech did not address proposals to allow large, multinational companies to repatriate an estimated $1.5 trillion of overseas profits to the United States at a reduced tax rate.  “These are software companies, pharma companies that have billions of dollars stranded overseas,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. “It’s a disappointment that we didn’t see a definitive package on bringing those profits back home.”  Among stocks that would benefit from such a move, Xerox Corp (XRX.N) fell 5.5 percent to $7.41 and Hewlett Packard (HPQ.N) fell 5.1 percent to $22.65.

74,MCD,How to play it: Potential winners on Obama's Jobs Act plan,"* THE ISSUE: President Barack Obama called on Congress late Thursday to pass a $447 billion package of spending initiatives and tax cuts to boost economic growth and generate jobs. Here are several investment ideas based on his proposals.  By Manuela Badawy  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Obama’s American Jobs Act, which he announced to a rare joint session of Congress late Thursday, includes proposals for a $175 billion one-year extension and expansion of the employee payroll tax holiday that would halve the tax rate to 3.1 percent in 2012 as well as a $65 billion tax break to encourage small businesses to hire more workers. The Act also features $50 billion in spending to upgrade highways, transit, rail and aviation infrastructure.  Wall Street stocks tumbled on Friday as the surprise resignation of a European Central Bank executive board member and skepticism over President Obama’s economic stimulus spending plans weighed on sentiment.  The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 233.93 points, or 2.07 percent, to 11,061.88. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 22.55 points, or 1.90 percent, to 1,163.35, while the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 36.24 points, or 1.43 percent, to 2,492.90.  Consumer discretionary stocks could be helped by the announced moves to help small business. The Obama push is expected to help families with combined incomes of $80,000, said Bernie Williams, vice president of discretionary money management for USAA.  Dollar Tree stores could gain if this stimulates hiring at this income level, added Brian Lazorishak, a portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel with $1 billion in assets under management. McDonald’s and Starbucks Corp. and other restaurants could benefit as well, Lazorishak said.  Small business service providers like Intuit, the maker of TurboTax and Quicken accounting software, and those related to staffing that are directly tied to employment are likely to get a boost.  “This financial crisis was a consumer-led recession, so anything that you can do to prop up the consumer and spending is good,” said Williams of USAA. The tax cut is a direct injection to consumers’ pockets.  “That money will get spent. It will get spent more in necessities, like the Targets of the world, staples companies,” said Williams, who has direct management of $4 billion from high net worth individuals. “They will have that stimulus this year and next year if that gets passed.”  Obama’s spending allotment included a healthy dose of funding for public infrastructure, an area of focus in the 2009 ‘stimulus bill,’ and a traditional area of focus for the current administration, J.P. Morgan noted in a report Friday.  The firm said beneficiaries could include aggregate-focused companies Marietta, Vulcan Materials and Eagle Materials and infrastructure-focused firms such as URS Corp., Jacobs Engineer and Fluor Corp.  Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management, with $18 billion in assets, added that capital investment in infrastructure has him bullish on shares of Caterpillar Inc., Fastenal Co. and Cummins Inc..  “Fastenal, for example, is a construction supplies company. It markets globally, experiencing a strong top-line, and is shareholder friendly via dividend growth rate. This fits into the whole infrastructure play,” he said.  Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois, shared Wirtz’s sentiments.  “Caterpillar, Navistar — the big earth-moving equipment and construction vehicles — would benefit on additional spending in construction,” Sampson said.  Government-funded projects including $30 billion to modernize at least 35,000 public schools and $27 billion for investment in the nation’s highway system is “significant” for the construction sector, said Robert Gardiner of Davy Research.  “The act in its current form would be a significant positive for CRH (highways and refurbishment projects) and Wolseley (refurbishment projects),” Gardiner said.  Overall, whatever the federal government does to help states will tend to help cash-stressed local governments, which could consequently help municipal bonds.  Munis should outperform in this environment, Morgan Stanley said in a report. But too much stimulus might boost interest rates. That would not be great news for fixed-income investments like munis, which lose value as rates go up, though the appetite for yield could negate that possibility.  Whether the Obama proposal will actually get passed in a gridlocked Congress remains a major issue. Early results from investors indicate skepticism.  Shares of Dollar Tree were down 1.12 percent while McDonald’s and Starbucks stocks were under more selling pressure in mid-day trading on Friday. McDonald’s fell 4.65 percent and Starbucks dropped 3.37 percent.

77,MCD,HOW TO PLAY IT: Potential winners on Obama's Jobs Act plan," * THE ISSUE: President Barack Obama called on Congress late Thursday to pass a $447 billion package of spending initiatives and tax cuts to boost economic growth and generate jobs. Here are several investment ideas based on his proposals.   By Manuela Badawy   NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Obama’s American Jobs Act, which he announced to a rare joint session of Congress late Thursday, includes proposals for a $175 billion one-year extension and expansion of the employee payroll tax holiday that would halve the tax rate to 3.1 percent in 2012 as well as a $65 billion tax break to encourage small businesses to hire more workers. The Act also features $50 billion in spending to upgrade highways, transit, rail and aviation infrastructure.   For more details please click on [ID:nN1E7871QW] here  Wall Street stocks tumbled on Friday as the surprise resignation of a European Central Bank executive board member and skepticism over President Obama’s economic stimulus spending plans weighed on sentiment.

The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX dropped 22.55 points, or 1.90 percent, to 1,163.35, while the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC dropped 36.24 points, or 1.43 percent, to 2,492.90.   Consumer discretionary stocks could be helped by the announced moves to help small business. The Obama push is expected to help families with combined incomes of $80,000, said Bernie Williams, vice president of discretionary money management for USAA.   Dollar Tree stores (DLTR.O) could gain if this stimulates hiring at this income level, added Brian Lazorishak, a portfolio manager at Chase Investment Counsel with $1 billion in assets under management. McDonald’s (MCD.N) and Starbucks Corp. (SBUX.O) and other restaurants could benefit as well, Lazorishak said.   Small business service providers like Intuit (INTU.O), the maker of TurboTax and Quicken accounting software, and those related to staffing that are directly tied to employment are likely to get a boost.   “This financial crisis was a consumer-led recession, so anything that you can do to prop up the consumer and spending is good,” said Williams of USAA. The tax cut is a direct injection to consumers’ pockets.   “That money will get spent.

78,MCD,McDonald's August sales miss; Japan drags,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) reported a lower-than-expected rise in worldwide August sales at established restaurants on a steep drop in Japan and a lull in new product launches in the United States.  The world’s largest hamburger chain, whose shares fell 4.4 percent on Friday, said sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 3.5 percent globally. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were looking for an increase of 4.3 percent.  Same-restaurant sales rose 3.9 percent in the United States, just shy of analysts’ 4.0 percent expectation. In Europe — McDonald’s largest market — the company reported an increase of 2.7 percent, missing analysts’ estimate of a 4.7 percent increase.  To help increase sales, McDonald’s has relied on new products like breakfast oatmeal and a beverage overhaul that has included the introduction of fruit smoothies and other drinks.  In August 2010, demand for smoothies helped drive up U.S. same-restaurant sales by 4.6 percent.  This year “new product launches were really weighted toward the front half of the summer,” Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy said.  But he noted the company was still doing better than its competitors in terms of same-restaurant sales.  “It’s still comping positive while a lot of their competitors are still squarely in negative territory,” Hottovy said.  McDonald’s sales and profits for months have been the envy of the global fast-food industry, which means that the company is punished when results meet or miss expectations.  The company has been outpacing rivals like Wendy’s Co WEN.N, Burger King Corp BKCBK.UL and Yum Brands Inc’s (YUM.N) KFC by attracting a broader range of diners than fast-food’s typical young adult males.  McDonald’s reported a 0.3 percent decline in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, while Wall Street had forecast a rise of 3.5 percent.  Asia was dragged down by a sharp decline in comparable sales in Japan, where consumers are still adjusting to the aftermath of the March earthquake and tsunami.  Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at Oakbrook Investments, said the weak results in Japan were troubling, given how many months have passed since the earthquake and tsunami struck in March.  “I would have thought that was already priced into expectations,” Sampson said. “But one month does not make for a pattern ... If we see that continue in September, it becomes more problematic.”  Earlier this week, Red Lobster and Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc (DRI.N) warned that Hurricane Irene had dented its quarterly earnings by 2 cents per share.  But Irene had only minimal impact on McDonald’s sales, a company spokeswoman said.  Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s shares were down 4.4 percent at $84.71 in New York Stock Exchange trading.

81,MCD,Wall Street tumbles as ECB discord stirs broad fears,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks tumbled more than 2 percent on Friday after the top German official at the European Central Bank resigned in protest of the bank’s bond-buying program, which has been a major tool in fighting the region’s debt crisis.  The resignation of Juergen Stark from the ECB throws into question policymakers’ ability to deal with Europe’s debt crisis, a problem that could engulf a world economy already teetering on the brink of recession.  Investors’ rising fears were highlighted by a 12 percent jump in the market’s main measure of expected turbulence, the VIX volatility index .VIX. The VIX neared 40, close to its highest level this year, as it marked its biggest jump in three weeks.  “Stark’s resignation is suggesting that there is a lot of pressure being built in the senior levels in the ECB,” said James Dailey, portfolio manager of TEAM Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. “There is an increasing realization that this is a major solvency issue in the banking system.”  Doubts about President Barack Obama’s $447 billion stimulus proposal added to the negative sentiment, with investors unconvinced his administration has the tools to revive the flagging U.S. economy.  The sell-off was broad and on solid volume. All 10 S&P sectors were in the red and more than 80 percent of stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange fell. There were 8.7 billion shares traded on the NYSE, the Nasdaq and the Amex, above the exchanges’ 20-day moving average.  Unnerving traders further were unconfirmed terrorism threats against New York City and Washington just ahead of the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.  “There is an extreme amount of negativity,” said Sam Ginzburg, a senior trader at First New York Securities.  “In talking to the sell-side desks that we do business with, they’re not telling me that there are long-onlys adding to or initiating positions right now,” he said.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 303.68 points, or 2.69 percent, to 10,992.13. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX dropped 31.67 points, or 2.67 percent, to 1,154.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC dropped 61.15 points, or 2.42 percent, to 2,467.99.  The ECB has been buying up sovereign bonds to help hold down borrowing costs in some debt-strapped euro zone members, and the program has been considered critical to arresting market contagion. The resignation of Stark, who will step down by the end of the year, may deepen the gulf between the ECB and German guardians of central banking orthodoxy.  At a meeting of finance chiefs from the Group of Seven wealthy nations being held in France, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Friday pressed Europe’s strongest economies to give “unequivocal” financial support to weaker euro zone states to overcome a debt crisis that threatens the world economy.  The S&P 500 ended the week 1.7 percent lower and is now down 8.2 percent this year.  Shares of some big companies fell after Obama’s speech did not address proposals to allow large, multinational companies to repatriate an estimated $1.5 trillion of overseas profits to the United States at a reduced tax rate.  “These are software companies, pharma companies that have billions of dollars stranded overseas,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. “It’s a disappointment that we didn’t see a definitive package on bringing those profits back home.”  Among stocks that would benefit from such a move, Xerox Corp (XRX.N) fell 5.5 percent to $7.41 and Hewlett Packard (HPQ.N) fell 5.1 percent to $22.65.

82,MCD,"Olive Garden, Red Lobster slimming kids' menus","(Reuters) - Olive Garden and Red Lobster parent Darden Restaurants Inc said on Thursday it would reduce calories and sodium in its meals for children, amid growing calls for healthier and more nutritious restaurant fare.  Darden, one of the top performing U.S. restaurant operators, also said it planned to reduce sodium and calories across all its restaurant meals.  The restaurant industry is under pressure from public health officials and consumer advocates to cut the calories and improve the nutritional value of meals for U.S. children — with nearly one-in-three either obese or overweight.  The children’s meal announcement covers Darden’s Olive Garden, Red Lobster, LongHorn Steakhouse and Bahama Breeze restaurants. Those four brands will each offer at least one kids’ meal option that weighs in at less than 600 calories.  Darden’s other brands are high-end steakhouse Capital Grille and Seasons 52, the latter having no dish with more than 475 calories.  “I hope that parents will take full advantage of these kinds of new options,” First Lady Michelle Obama said at the company’s media event in near Washington, D.C.  “Parents, we literally have to put our money where our mouths are ... We have to give (restaurants) the incentive to do the right thing,” said Obama, who has made tackling childhood obesity her signature issue.  The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group that advocates for healthier and safer food, issued a statement supporting Darden’s change and urged other restaurant operators to do the same.  “Other restaurants should follow Darden’s lead and clean up their menus to make it easier for adults and children to choose healthy options,” CSPI said in a statement.  Companies ranging from McDonald’s Corp, Burger King Corp, Cracker Barrel, Denny’s and DineEquity already have announced plans to slim down some menu options for children.  While many restaurants are vowing to offer healthier food, they also say they will continue to sell and promote indulgent dishes that are high in calories, fat, sugar or salt.  CSPI regularly alerts consumers to some of the U.S. restaurant industry’s most unhealthy dishes.

85,MCD,Criminal probe targets seven Midwest IHOPs,"(Reuters) - Federal agents executed search warrants against seven IHOP restaurants owned by a single franchisee in Ohio and Indiana, a spokesman for parent company DineEquity Inc said on Wednesday.  FBI, Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were involved in the searches at each of the seven restaurants on Tuesday morning, Special Agent Scott Wilson of the FBI’s Cleveland division told Reuters.  Six of the targeted restaurants are located in Ohio and one is in Indiana. The restaurants have been cleared to reopen.  Local television station WTOL reported that a “well-placed source” with the Toledo Police Department said the investigation involved allegations of money laundering and potentially undocumented workers.  Wilson, of the FBI, said he could not reveal the reason for the investigation because the warrants are under seal.  Agents also searched two residences and one storage unit, said Wilson, who said he could not disclose who owns or leases those properties.  “It’s an ongoing criminal investigation,” said Immigration and Customs spokesman Khaalid Walls, who also declined to give additional details.  DineEquity spokesman Patrick Lenow said both the company and the franchisee, Tarek Elkafrawi, were cooperating with authorities.  Lenow said Elkafrawi and his attorney were “not offering interviews and do not have any insight into the reasons for the investigation”.  Reuters was not immediately able to contact Elkafrawi or his attorney for comment.  “It is our desire to gain details on the reason for the investigation,” said Lenow, who added that the company has been told that the investigation is not linked to terrorism.  U.S. immigration agents have been targeting employers rather than workers since 2009. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, the highest-profile target of that crackdown, is the subject of a criminal probe into its hiring practices.  Franchisees of restaurants such as McDonald’s Corp, Subway and Chuy’s also have been targeted.  Stricter immigration enforcement — along with tighter post-September 11 national security — is making it harder for undocumented workers to use their real names and fake or stolen Social Security numbers to get jobs.  In March, eight Pei Wei restaurants in Arizona were temporarily closed following an employment-related identity theft investigation conducted by local authorities.  Those authorities said they arrested more than two dozen undocumented Pei Wei workers suspected of using fake identification to gain employment.

89,MCD,"Starbucks eyes growth in U.S., Europe, Russia","PARIS (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) chief executive expressed confidence in the future of the economies of the United States and Europe on Thursday and said the group was planning to open at least 200 new stores in its home market next year.  The world’s biggest coffee chain also wants to grow in Western Europe, notably in Germany and France, and is looking at expanding in Russia, Howard Schultz told Reuters in an interview.  “I am optimistic about America and I think it would be a mistake for people to underestimate the entrepreneurial spirit there,” he said.  “We will open up at least 200 new stores in the U.S. in 2012 and remodel 1,700 stores. That is part of our commitment to investing back in America and creating jobs,” he said.  The positive trend in Starbucks’ U.S. sales is expected to last over the coming months, he added.  Shares in Starbucks were down 1.7 percent at 1435 GMT (10:35 a.m. ET), however, as a grim outlook from the U.S. Federal Reserve and downbeat data in Europe and China heightened fears about a global recession.  Europe, meanwhile, is urgently looking for a solution to the euro zone debt crisis, Schultz said.  “We are all aware of the financial pressures on Western Europe and the anxiety that people are feeling,” Schultz said. “I feel these problems are complex but solvable and I think there is a renewed sense of urgency to solve them.”  Schultz said his teams had identified a number of countries where Starbucks did not have a large enough presence, such as Germany where, with 150 stores against 180 in Manhattan alone, the company planned to double or triple in size.  “With fewer than 65 stores, we are also dramatically understored in France,” Schultz said. Starbucks will unveil further French expansion plans “relatively soon,” he said.  The CEO said Starbucks was experiencing success in Russia where it also had plans to grow its business.  Starbucks, which generates about 20 percent of its revenue in international markets, announced a reorganization in July aimed at helping it generate half of its revenue outside the United States.  Schultz said the company would grow organically but that acquisitions were also possible.  “We are sitting on a very strong balance sheet and virtually no debt, so the future of the company I don’t think will only be organic, there could be other things,” he said.  Starbucks competes with chains such as Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O) and Caribou Coffee CBOU.O, as well as to an extent McDonalds (MCD.N) and a variety of smaller players.  Asked about commodities prices, Schultz said coffee prices were currently “at a very high level” but said Starbucks was not planning to implement wide price increases.  “We want to be as sensitive as possible to the financial pressures our customers are facing,” he said.  ICE arabica coffee futures have fallen around 22 percent from a 34-year peak hit in May. A shortage of high quality beans after several below-average crops from key producer Colombia saw coffee prices almost double last year.  Starbucks charges 3.50 euros ($4.79) on average for a tall “Caffe Latte” in Europe.  The group reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings on July 28 and said it was forecasting a 15-20 percent increase in earnings per share in 2012 as well as a 10 percent rise in revenue.

91,MCD,Dunkin' international president out after 4 months,"(Reuters) - Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) said on Friday that Neal Yanofsky is leaving after just four months as its international president.  “We mutually agreed that this was not a good fit for Neal or Dunkin’ Brands, and we will not disclose any further details,” a company spokesman said.  The owner of the Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins chains, which went public in July, said it was searching for a replacement.  Meanwhile, Dunkin’ Donuts International will report to Chief Executive Nigel Travis, and Baskin-Robbins International will report to Chief Financial Officer Neil Moses.  Not too long ago, CEO Travis praised Yanofsky.  “Neal is a strategic thinker with a demonstrated ability to build successful companies,” Travis said in a May 10 statement announcing Yanofsky joining the company. “His vast knowledge of operations, finance and marketing make him ideally suited to lead our international operations, drive profitable growth and enhance support for our franchisees around the world.”  Yanofsky previously was CEO of Generation Mobile, a venture-backed retailer of wireless products and services. Before that, his roles included president of Panera Bread Co PNRA.O, where Dunkin’ said he helped more than double the number of restaurants in five years, and chief marketing officer of Au Bon Pain.  “While we’re disappointed by the news given Yanofsky’s extensive retail and restaurant experience, the catalyst for the departure seems to be cultural differences rather than disappointing performance at the (international) segment,” said Barclays Capital analyst Jeffrey Bernstein.  Dunkin’ on Friday announced marketing changes designed to support its international growth efforts. It also repeated plans to add 450 to 500 net new Dunkin’ Donuts stores and Baskin-Robbins ice cream stores outside the United States this year to the almost 7,000 international spots already in existence.  There are now roughly 3,000 Dunkin’ Donuts outlets and more than 2,500 Baskin-Robbins shops outside the United States.  Dunkin’ Donuts sells coffee and other beverages as well as doughnuts, bagels, sandwiches and other foods. It competes with Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) — two popular and well-run chains — around the globe.  Bernstein said he did not expect Yanofsky’s departure to have a material impact on Dunkin’ Brands’ third-quarter results, which are expected to be reported in late October.  The division Yanofsky led has traditionally contributed only a fraction of company revenue.  For the second quarter ended June 25, Dunkin’ Donuts International had revenue of $3.8 million, accounting for just over 2 percent of the company’s total revenue of $157.0 million. Baskin-Robbins International, on the other hand, had revenue of $27.4 million during the quarter.

93,MCD,TEXT-Fitch Rates McDonald's $500MM Note Issuance 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following was released by the rating agency)	   CHICAGO, Sept 27 - Fitch Ratings has assigned an ‘A’ rating to McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD) newly issued $500 million 2.625% 10.25-year senior unsecured notes due Jan. 15, 2022. 	   The Rating Outlook is Stable. At June 30, 2011, McDonald’s had $12.3 billion of total debt. The notes were issued under McDonald’s Medium Term Notes Program dated Sept. 28, 2009 and rank pari passu with McDonald’s existing debt. There are no financial covenants. 	   Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include refinancing of debt. Aggregate maturities of long-term debt total approximately $1 billion in both 2012 and 2013 and are expected to be refinanced. 	   Fitch views this issuance as opportunistic given the extremely low market interest rates. McDonald’s ratings reflect the company’s substantial cash flow generation, considerable financial flexibility, and leading global market position. The ratings also consider the company’s significant real estate ownership and well-established franchisee network, which provides a sizeable royalty stream along with contractual rental income on properties owned or leased by McDonald’s. 	   At June 30, 2011, franchisees and affiliates operated approximately 80% of the company’s 32,943 restaurants systemwide. Over the past five years, annual free cash flow (defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and dividends) has averaged $1.6 billion. 	   Year-end cash balances have exceeded $1.8 billion during the same period. McDonald’s liquidity is further supplemented by a $1.25 billion committed revolving credit line. The undrawn facility expires March 16, 2012 but is expected to be renewed before that date. McDonald’s three global operating priorities are to optimize its menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to its brand. Year-to-date through Aug. 31, 2011, same-store sales (SSS) are up 4.7% with every region of the world contributing. Comparable sales are up 3.9% in the United States, 5.3% in Europe, and 3.5% in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region. 	   The company is benefiting from expanded beverage and breakfast offerings, restaurant re-imaging and a focus on everyday affordability. Fitch expects McDonald’s to continue to generate strong operating results despite prolonged high unemployment, an increasingly competitive environment in the United States, and austerity measures in Europe. 	   Reinvesting in its business and returning cash to shareholders while maintaining credit measures appropriate for its ‘A/F1’ rating is the foundation of McDonald’s financial strategy. The company plans to spend $2.5 billion on capital expenditures in 2011, up from $2.1 billion in 2010. During the six months ended June 30, 2011, McDonald’s returned a total of $3.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. This is also an increase from the $2.6 billion returned during the same period last year. Fitch would expect McDonald’s to pull back on share repurchases should the company experience a prolonged period of SSS declines or significant margin compression but this is not anticipated. McDonald’s extensive procurement infrastructure provides substantial buying power but higher commodity costs are affecting the entire food complex. 	   For the six months ended June 30, 2011, McDonald’s global company-operated restaurant margin declined 70 basis points but remains high at 18.4%. Combined operating margin, which includes profits from franchise operations, however, expanded to 30.8% from 30.5% last year. McDonald’s credit statistics are in line with Fitch’s expectations and are projected to remain relatively stable in the near term, even after considering the current debt issuance. 	   For the latest 12-month (LTM) period ended June 30, 2011, total debt-to-operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and operating EBITDA-to-gross interest expense were 1.4 times (x) and 18.7x, respectively. 	   Rent-adjusted leverage, defined as total debt plus eight times gross rent expense divided by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and gross rent expense (EBITDAR), was 2.3x. 	   Rent adjusted interest coverage, defined as EBITDAR divided by gross interest expense plus gross rent expense, was 5.2x, and funds from operations fixed-charge coverage was 4.3x. 	   Fitch currently rates McDonald’s debt as follows: —Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) ‘A’; —Bank credit facility ‘A’; —Senior unsecured debt ‘A’; —Short-term IDR ‘F1’; —Commercial paper ‘F1’.

94,MCD,A gluten-free for all drives product sales,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Los Angeles voice actor Nancy Truman landed a new role as a full-time gluten-free baker after she tweaked her recipes to replace the wheat that was making her feel miserable.  Truman is among the estimated 18 million people in the United States who are sensitive to gluten — a hard-to-digest protein found in wheat, rye and barley.  Another 3 million-plus Americans are thought to have celiac disease, a potentially life-threatening autoimmune disorder that is treated by eliminating dietary gluten.  In business, as in acting, good timing proved crucial for Truman.  Sales of gluten-free products have been booming despite the weak U.S. economy. Health advocates and gluten-free celebrities such as 2011 U.S. Open champion Novak Djokovic, Chelsea Clinton and TV host Elisabeth Hasselbeck have helped drive demand by raising awareness about celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.  Truman also had the good luck of being a friend and neighbor to Waylynn Lucas, one of Los Angeles’ most celebrated pastry chefs, who is a fan of her gluten-free goodies.  The two now are partners in (fonuts), a new coffee shop that sells baked, not fried, doughnuts. Gluten-free options account for half of sales at (fonuts).  Lucas said customers are either avoiding gluten themselves or “have a friend, a boyfriend, a girlfriend, a cousin, a father, a mother, a whatever, who is gluten intolerant.”  “When they see it can be delicious and a little more healthful, they’re really turned on,” Truman said.  GLUTEN-FREE GROWTH  Gluten is everywhere. It is in baked goods, pasta and beer, as well as some unexpected items, such as McDonald’s french fries, lunch meat, lipstick and some medicines.  Euromonitor International forecasts 2011 gluten-free sales of $1.31 billion in the United States and $2.67 billion worldwide. Sales have more than doubled since 2005 and are expected to hit $1.68 billion in the United States and $3.38 billion globally in 2015.  “Consumers do feel some sort of reward when they eat gluten-free products. They don’t feel bloated. They don’t have belly aches. This usually encourages them to repeat the purchase,” said Ewa Hudson, Euromonitor International’s head of health and wellness research.  Europe is ahead of the United States when it comes to celiac disease testing and awareness. Italy, for example, helps people with celiac disease pay for the additional cost of gluten-free foods.  But big U.S. companies are jumping into the fray.  General Mills Inc is a leader, having reformulated some Chex breakfast cereals, Betty Crocker cake and brownie mixes and Bisquick pancake mix to remove gluten.

95,MCD,A gluten-free for all drives product sales," * Diet trends, medical needs fuel gluten-free food demand   * 2011 U.S. sales forecast to hit $1.68 billion by 2015   * Health advocates, celebrities, athletes boost awareness   By Lisa Baertlein   LOS ANGELES, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Los Angeles voice actor Nancy Truman landed a new role as a full-time gluten-free baker after she tweaked her recipes to replace the wheat that was making her feel miserable.   Truman is among the estimated 18 million people in the United States who are sensitive to gluten — a hard-to-digest protein found in wheat, rye and barley.   Another 3 million-plus Americans are thought to have celiac disease, a potentially life-threatening autoimmune disorder that is treated by eliminating dietary gluten.   In business, as in acting, good timing proved crucial for Truman.   Sales of gluten-free products have been booming despite the weak U.S. economy. Health advocates and gluten-free celebrities such as 2011 U.S. Open champion Novak Djokovic, Chelsea Clinton and TV host Elisabeth Hasselbeck have helped drive demand by raising awareness about celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.   Truman also had the good luck of being a friend and neighbor to Waylynn Lucas, one of Los Angeles’ most celebrated pastry chefs, who is a fan of her gluten-free goodies.   The two now are partners in (fonuts), a new coffee shop that sells baked, not fried, doughnuts. Gluten-free options account for half of sales at (fonuts).   Lucas said customers are either avoiding gluten themselves or “have a friend, a boyfriend, a girlfriend, a cousin, a father, a mother, a whatever, who is gluten intolerant.”   “When they see it can be delicious and a little more healthful, they’re really turned on,” Truman said.   GLUTEN-FREE GROWTH   Gluten is everywhere. It is in baked goods, pasta and beer, as well as some unexpected items, such as McDonald’s (MCD.N) french fries, lunch meat, lipstick and some medicines.   Euromonitor International forecasts 2011 gluten-free sales of $1.31 billion in the United States and $2.67 billion worldwide. Sales have more than doubled since 2005 and are expected to hit $1.68 billion in the United States and $3.38 billion globally in 2015.   “Consumers do feel some sort of reward when they eat gluten-free products. They don’t feel bloated. They don’t have belly aches. This usually encourages them to repeat the purchase,” said Ewa Hudson, Euromonitor International’s head of health and wellness research.   Europe is ahead of the United States when it comes to celiac disease testing and awareness. Italy, for example, helps people with celiac disease pay for the additional cost of gluten-free foods.   But big U.S. companies are jumping into the fray.   General Mills Inc (GIS.N) is a leader, having reformulated some Chex breakfast cereals, Betty Crocker cake and brownie mixes and Bisquick pancake mix to remove gluten.   Anheuser Busch Inbev SA (ABI.BR) sells a gluten-free beer called Redbridge, which is sold in many mainstream supermarkets.   P.F. Chang’s China Bistro Inc PFCB.O for years has had a gluten-free menu and Subway, the popular sandwich chain, is testing gluten-free bread and brownies in Texas and Oregon.

Paulo newspaper reported.   FIFA has asked Brazil to suspend several laws while it hosts the World Cup, including one that requires theatrical and sports events to provide half-price tickets to people over 65, the paper reported on Saturday.   The laws, FIFA says, threaten to increase the governing body’s costs, reduce its ability to protect its brands and sponsors’ trademarks and to saddle FIFA with other legal liabilities, Estado said, citing Orlando Silva, Brazil’s sports minister.   Rousseff plans to meet FIFA President Joseph Blatter in Brussels on Monday and is ready to compromise on a series of FIFA complaints, Silva told the newspaper.   They include some prohibitions on alcohol sales and rules that grant low-cost tickets to students and youth, the newspaper said. She won’t suspend the Elderly Persons’ Statute or consumer protection laws, it reported.   Rousseff’s office would not confirm or deny a meeting. Brazil’s sports ministry and FIFA’s media department did not return phone calls Saturday.   FIFA’s complaints come after criticism of delays in the construction or repair of stadiums and the expansion of public transport facilities for the World Cup. Allegations have also been rising about cost overruns and corruption related to the World Cup and the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.[ID:nS1E78C1CF] [ID:nLDE72S2GA]   FIFA 2014 World Cup sponsors include Adidas (ADSGn.DE), Coca-Cola (KO.N), Sony (6758.T), Anheuser-Busch InBev’s Budweiser unit (ABI.BR) and McDonald’s (MCD.N) and Visa (V.N).   The World Cup Bill being debated in Congress, for example, fails to provide sufficient penalties to companies and individuals who sell pirate goods or infringe trademarks, it said, citing Silva.   The penalties are three months to two years in jail or a fine, which FIFA considers “innocuous,” Estado reported.

98,MCD,KFC parent Yum fails to ease China fears,"(Reuters) - KFC parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) posted a quarterly profit that failed to assuage investor worries about slowing growth in China, its biggest market.  Shares in the fast-food chain, whose third-quarter profit matched Wall Street’s expectations, fell 1.9 percent in extended trading.  China — the world’s fastest growing major economy — is Yum’s biggest earnings driver, accounting for just over 40 percent of overall profits. But analysts say the slowdown might have accelerated this quarter.  Closely watched sales at Yum’s established restaurants in China rose 19 percent in the third quarter, but those results only captured Yum’s China operations through the end of August.  “The talk in Asia is that China is starting to slow down,” said Michael Yoshikami founder and chief executive of YCMNET Advisors, who tracks Yum as part of his investment in rival McDonald’s Corp. (MCD.N)  Yum, which is widely regarded as one of the biggest China plays for investors in the U.S. stock market, will hold a conference call with analysts on Wednesday morning.  “You own this stock for their exposure to China,” said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo.  “We’re going to want to know what’s gone on in China for the last five weeks,” said Russo, who added that some economic data out of the country backs the thesis that growth is cooling.  Yum said on Tuesday it raised menu prices after the quarter ended to help offset higher costs.  Yum, based in Louisville, Kentucky, has almost 4,200 restaurants, mostly KFC outlets, in China. It is the largest Western restaurant brand in China, with far more restaurants than competitors such as McDonald’s and Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O).  Yum’s other fast-food brands are Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.  Sales at established restaurants in Yum Restaurants International (YRI) were up 3 percent during the third quarter. That division includes Yum’s other non-U.S. markets such as France, India and Russia.  While Yum’s business is robust in international markets, it continues to struggle at home.  Overall sales at U.S. restaurants open at least one year fell 3 percent. That result included declines of 2 percent at Taco Bell, 3 percent at Pizza Hut and 3 percent at KFC.  Operating profit was up in China and YRI, but down in the United States.  Yum’s net income in the third quarter ended September 3 rose to $383 million, or 80 cents per share, from $357 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding special items, Yum’s profit was 83 cents per share, matching analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue rose to $3.27 billion from $2.86 billion a year earlier.  Shares in Yum fell to $48.51 after closing at $49.44 on the New York Stock Exchange,  ",10042011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yum/kfc-parent-yum-fails-to-ease-china-fears-idUSTRE7936N220111004

100,MCD,HOW TO PLAY IT- Run from the bear or grin at it," ISSUE: The stock market dropped briefly into bear market territory on Monday. What does an investor do while the market flirts with a big drop?   By Manuela Badawy   NEW YORK, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Wall Street started the week under a foreboding shadow.   The Standard & Poor’s 500 index extended a three-month downward spiral to a total loss of 20 percent — a level at which many technical analysts declare a bear market, and from which stocks often fall into a longer, deeper retrenchment.   While the market has staged a strong rebound since, optimism is in short supply as Europe tilts toward recession, Greece toward default and the United States toward more sluggish economic growth. Equity fund withdrawals are at their highest rate since the 2008 financial crisis.   Here are views on what to do while waiting to see if the bear is back in hibernation or ready for action once again:   Some strategists see the present levels as tempting. The market has been swinging back and forth over a wide range and some see it continuing to rebound.  “We did sell in early August when momentum broke down, but we are looking for an entry point,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Bank with $55 billion in assets.   A bear market is supposed to kick in when an index such as Standard & Poor’s SPX.N falls 20 percent from a high. On Monday, stocks rebounded late in the day, avoiding the bear status, albeit just barely.   Many are skeptical about reading too much into the numbers.   But there clearly is a pattern: Seven of the eight times the S&P has closed with a 20-percent cumulative loss, stocks have fallen further over the next year and sometimes by a lot more.   However the market plays out, cash-rich corporate America has enough of a cushion to pay dividends — even in a recession, says Colin Moore, chief investment officer at Columbia Management Investment Advisers, with $362 billion in assets under management.   Indeed, dividend hikes are still possible. Companies are paying out 30 percent of their cash, which is historically low, especially in a business climate where managers see few places to put cash to work.   “The amount of dividend paid should be closer to 40 percent to 45 percent,” Moore said.   Moore’s Columbia Dividend Income Fund (LBSAX.O) top holdings are International Business Machines (IBM.N), Philip Morris (PM.N), Verizon Communications (VZ.N), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and AT&T (T.N).   In a full-on bear market, all equities suffer. But to reduce risk exposure, strategists suggest looking at companies like consumer staples firms, which are less prone to recession.   Food and beverages are “products that we need in our everyday lives irrespective of whether we are in recession or not,” said John De Clue, senior vice president at US bank, with $113 billion in assets.   Healthcare is a classic defensive area because while these companies are influenced by the state of the economy, they depend more on the regulatory environment, De Clue said.   Bernie Williams, money manager for USAA who oversees $4 billion in discretionary assets from high net worth individuals, cites Sysco (SYY.N), Chevron (CVX.N) and McDonalds’ (MCD.N) as good defensive holdings.   Treasury yields have sunk so low they have lost their appeal for many income-driven investors. Two to three percent yields seem like small beans given the recent U.S. debt downgrade and the chance that monetary stimulus might boost inflation.   Investment-grade bonds, by comparison, have managed to hold higher yields and credit quality has remained reasonably high in some sectors.   It’s not hard to find four percent corporate bond yields, which offer more than twice the yield of the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury note of 1.89 percent.   Some strategists are looking at high-yield bonds — but they advise caution since the  high-yield sector tends to do worse in slowdowns than higher-rated fixed income.   Still, mutual funds or Exchange Traded Funds that carry these assets can return a yield of up to 8 percent.   “That’s darned attractive,” says Bernie Williams, money manager for USAA who oversees $4 billion in discretionary assets from high net worth individuals.   Williams cited two funds with close to an 8 percent yield, USAA High Yield Opportunities Fund USHYX and an ETF, iShares iBoxx HY Corp Bond Fund (HYG).   The perception is that emerging market investing is one of the riskiest categories. But since China and Brazil have become net creditors, and with robust economic growth in many emerging economies, some fund managers say this sector is worth looking at — even when “risk” assets are being dumped.   Some even see it as a safe haven in with U.S. and European markets in upheaval.   “If you look at the pull-back in price, it is an attractive buying opportunity,” said Thomas Wilson, senior investment manager of the institutional investment group at Brinker Capital with $12 billion in assets.  “Europe looks very cheap but you are playing with politics,” Williams said. “One strategy is to wait for the news of the (Greek) default and then go in.”  ",10062011,http://www.reuters.com/article/howtoplay-bearmarket/how-to-play-it-run-from-the-bear-or-grin-at-it-idUSN1E7940UQ20111006

102,MCD,McDonald's Channel comes to California restaurants,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Welcome to McDonald’s, would you like some TV with that? McDonald’s Corp will roll out a high-definition television channel to nearly 800 restaurants in southern and central California by March. The world’s biggest hamburger chain is doing this as part of a test, and one day hopes to take it across the United States. Businesses from gas stations and grocery stores to coffee maker Starbucks Corp are beaming more entertainment directly to customers, trying to address a captive audience in a world crawling with entertainment options. McDonald’s Channel content partners include Walt Disney Co’s ABC, BBC America and reality television producer Mark Burnett, who is known for such hits as “Survivor” and “The Apprentice.” Test markets have include Los Angeles, San Diego, Las Vegas, Manhattan, Seattle and some communities in Oklahoma. As it evolves, the McDonald’s Channel will add more local programing such as high school sports news. “We think that’s a major part of the community that the channel can really bring to life,” said Leland Edmondson, founder of ChannelPort Communications, which is overseeing the project. “We’re talking to a number of sports properties.” The programing will include exclusive content and be made up of short spots ranging in length from 90 seconds to 20 minutes. Diners who want to see longer versions of some spots will have the option access them via mobile devices or home computers. “There’s no remote on the table, but there is Wi-Fi in the restaurant,” Edmondson said. Programs include “The McDonald’s Achievers,” profiles of local high school and college athletes; “Mighty Moms,” about local mothers balancing families and careers in sports; and “Vimby” (Video In My Backyard), which has partnered with Burnett to cover local lifestyle news including fashion, art, music, action sports and nightlife. The channel will show less than eight minutes of advertising per hour. McDonald’s will take a fraction of that time, which will be shared with other brands, he said. Eventually, every McDonald’s in southern California will carry the channel, which will be seen by about 18 million McDonald’s customers in the area each month, Edmondson said.

103,MCD,McDonald's growth defies volatile economy,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) reported a higher-than-expected third-quarter profit on Friday as new menu items and renovations lifted sales during a summer of extreme economic volatility, and its shares rose nearly 3 percent. The world’s biggest restaurant company and its franchisees have been investing in the business at a time when diners are reacting to economic volatility by carefully managing their spending. The strategy has helped McDonald’s win market share from rivals that are smaller and have less financial heft. By adding Dollar Menu items and introducing high-margin beverages such as coffee and fruit smoothies, McDonald’s has broadened its appeal beyond the young men who account for the biggest share of sales at most other fast-food chains. The company, which also has accelerated its global expansion, has been making its restaurants in Europe and the United States more modern and inviting. That effort is boosting sales and making service faster and more efficient. (For a graphic on McDonald's results, click link.reuters.com/xad64s) Sales at established restaurants rose 6.6 percent in September. That was nearly twice the gain analysts expected and landed amid debt woes in Europe, stubbornly high unemployment in the United States and worries about slower growth in China. U.S. same-restaurant sales rose 5 percent, while Europe was up 6.9 percent and Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa had a 6.8 percent increase. The company forecast a 4 to 5 percent increase in sales at established restaurants in October. McDonald’s said sales at established restaurants in China were up 11.3 percent for the third quarter. KFC parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N), which is the No. 1 U.S. restaurant brand in the world’s fastest-growing major economy, recently reported a 19 percent gain in same-restaurant sales. Strong September results from Europe, especially Germany, helped allay fears that austerity measures would pummel demand in the region, said Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matthew DiFrisco. McDonald’s “continues to evolve into more of a staple than a discretionary brand,” said DiFrisco, adding that the company also turned in solid results from the United States. The company nudged up its forecast for food and other costs, but DiFrisco said this was no cause for concern. “They are managing their costs and margins in an environment where commodity costs are still heady,” he said. “Consumers everywhere continue to be cautious and hesitant to spend,” Chief Executive Jim Skinner said on a conference call with analysts. Restaurant operators of all stripes are grappling with higher costs for beef and other ingredients. McDonald’s has raised menu prices to take some of the sting out of that hit, but said it would weigh future increases carefully. “We are very judicious about price increases because maintaining everyday affordability, particularly in the environment that we are in today, is paramount,” Chief Financial Officer Peter Bensen said on the conference call. “They seem to be listening to their customers,” said Michael Yoshikami, founder and CEO of YCMNET Advisors. McDonald’s customers wanted things like healthier kids’ meals, good coffee that was cheaper than at Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and premium hamburgers. The company delivered on those demands and now is reaping the benefits, Yoshikami said. Third-quarter net income rose to $1.51 billion, or $1.45 per share, from $1.39 billion, or $1.29 per share, a year ago. Analysts on average had forecast $1.43 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Earnings per share rose more than 12 percent but were up only about 6 percent excluding foreign currency benefits. Revenue rose 13.8 percent to $7.17 billion. Sales at established restaurants were up 5 percent globally in the quarter, with increases of 4.4 percent in the United States, 4.9 percent in Europe and 3.4 percent in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. McDonald’s shares were up 2.9 percent at $91.57 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock exchange.

Obstacles remain to resolving the crisis, and important differences still separate major players France and Germany, but investors apparently took it as a positive that their leaders have set a target date of Wednesday for finding a solution. “It’s that hope, it’s that anticipation that they have created,” said Rob Russell, president of Russell & Company in Dayton, Ohio. “The French and the Germans both have a lot to risk. They both have somewhat different ideas they are going to have to have some kind of solution.” The Dow Jones industrial average gained 194.59 points, or 1.69 percent, to 11,736.37. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  climbed 18.52 points, or 1.52 percent, to 1,233.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36.98 points, or 1.42 percent, to 2,635.60. Recent gains have pushed the S&P; 500 to the top end of its trading range between 1,230 and 1,250 where it has struggled to advance. Many investors are looking for progress in Europe before looking to earnings to push equities higher.

109,MCD,McDonald's McRib sandwich returns for second year in row,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - McDonald’s McRib sandwich, a boneless pork patty molded to look like ribs and covered with barbecue sauce, is returning to the chain’s restaurants this fall to the delight of fans and dismay of dietitians. In 2010, the McRib returned to McDonald’s nationally for the first time in 16 years, sparking a 4.8 percent U.S. sales increase last November. Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s said on Monday that sales spike “best showcased the passion consumers exhibit for this elusive sandwich,” and drove the fast-food chain to return the McRib to the menu again as a limited-time offer through November 14. McDonald’s said there have been several online petitions for the return of the sandwich. It has also been referenced in pop culture — an episode of “The Simpsons” has Homer craving the Krusty Burger “Ribwich.” The McRib has 500 calories, 26 grams of fat and 980 milligrams of sodium. “It’s a high calorie sandwich in general,” said Heather Morris, a dietitian at the Chicago-area Loyola University Medical Center. Morris said the barbecue sauce and the fact it’s not available all the time probably explains part of the sandwich’s appeal. “It unfortunately does attract people, but does not contribute to a healthy diet. I work on the stroke unit, and this is something I would advise patients against eating because of the high sodium content and saturated fat level.” ",10242011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-mcrib/mcdonalds-mcrib-sandwich-returns-for-second-year-in-row-idUSTRE79N5GN20111024
110,MCD,"McDonald's dumps egg supplier after safety, cruelty concerns","CHICAGO (Reuters) - McDonald’s said on Friday it dumped a McMuffin egg supplier after a government agency found filthy conditions and “unacceptable rodent activity,” and an animal rights group exposed cruel treatment of the chickens. The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning letter to the owner of Sparboe Farms on Wednesday stating the agency inspected five egg production facilities in Iowa, Minnesota and Colorado and found “serious violations” of a federal rule designed to prevent salmonella and protect consumers. The FDA letter warned the eggs may have been contaminated by filth and could be a health hazard. The agency also warned of unacceptable rodent activity. Bob Langert, a McDonald’s vice president, said in a written statement on Friday that McDonald’s decision was based on “concern regarding the management of Sparboe’s facilities.” McDonald decision also came after Mercy For Animals, an animal rights group, released findings of a three-month, three-state investigation of Sparboe’s facilities, which it said exposed unsanitary and inhumane treatment of the animals. The group’s executive director, Nathan Runkle, said Sparboe hired a worker, who really was an undercover investigator for the animal rights group. The investigator “was wired with a pin-hole camera and documented case after case of egregious animal abuse and neglect,” he said. Video on the group’s website showed dead hens in cages with living ones, chicks having their beaks broken then thrown into cages, a worker talking about other workers torturing the animals, and living chicks being discarded in plastic bags with dead ones. “Regarding the undercover videos, the behavior on tape is disturbing and completely unacceptable. McDonald’s wants to assure our customers that we demand humane treatment of animals by our suppliers,” Langert said. But he noted that the most alarming actions on video did not occur at Sparboe’s Vincent, Iowa, facility, which is the only one that supplied fresh eggs to McDonald’s. Sparboe Farms’ website states: “our commitment to food safety, humane animal care and environmental protection are just some of the key ingredients to providing our customers and friends with the highest quality eggs and egg products.” Reuters’ call seeking comment was not returned by the company, which says is it is the fifth largest shell egg producer and marketer in the United States. Last year, more than half a billion eggs were recalled after Salmonella sickened more than 1,000 people, the largest egg recall in U.S. history. The recall did not involve Sparboe Farms.

112,MCD,LivingSocial to run national meal deal with McDonald's,"(Reuters) - LivingSocial Inc is set to run a national discount offer with McDonald’s Corp as the second-largest daily-deals company moves to catch larger rival Groupon Inc. LivingSocial said on Wednesday that it will sell a booklet of individual vouchers for five Big Macs and five french fries — a $26 value — for $13 on Thursday. The deal will be capped at 1 million voucher booklets. Daily-deal companies usually offer discounts on goods and services from local merchants, but Groupon and LivingSocial have run some national deals to attract new subscribers. The McDonald’s offer — the largest national daily deal run with a fast-food chain — is the latest in a string of aggressive moves by LivingSocial. The company, part owned by Amazon.com, ran more than 20 national deals over the crucial Black Friday to Cyber Monday shopping weekend with companies including OfficeMax, Electronic Arts and Hewlett-Packard’s Snapfish. Groupon’s shares slumped below the company’s initial public offering price of $20 last week on concern about heightened competition with LivingSocial. LivingSocial will end up selling 325,000 to 350,000 vouchers from the Black Friday and Cyber Monday national deals, according to Mitch Spolan, senior vice president of national accounts at the company. Last year on Cyber Monday, LivingSocial ran its first national discount deal with Wine.com, selling about 14,000 vouchers, Spolan noted. In September, LivingSocial ran a national deal with high-end grocery chain Whole Foods Market, selling 1 million vouchers in 14 hours. “We were very happy with number of subscribers we picked up,” Spolan said. Groupon Chief Executive Andrew Mason said on Wednesday that his company sold more than 650,000 holiday deals between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Groupon shares jumped 9.3 percent to close at $17.50 on Wednesday. LivingSocial is working on raising more capital in a new private financing round. McDonald’s agreed to run a national discount deal to get access to LivingSocial’s customer base, according to Peter Sterling, McDonald’s vice president of marketing. LivingSocial has about 46 million subscribers worldwide, but it has not disclosed how many are U.S. subscribers. The McDonald’s deal is going to U.S. subscribers only. Groupon has more subscribers than LivingSocial, but McDonald’s chose the smaller of the two companies. “We looked at all of the providers,” Sterling said. “For our restaurant system, LivingSocial was the best fit for us.” He declined to comment further. Daily deal vouchers are typically printed from websites, but McDonald’s will mail the voucher booklet via the U.S. Postal Service. The company wanted to control the design of the vouchers and reduce the risk of fraud. “We have a secure printing supplier,” Sterling said.

115,MCD,McDonald's toy sale skirts Happy Meal restrictions,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp is skirting a new San Francisco law that aims to curb toy giveaways in sugar- and fat-laden restaurant meals for children by selling its popular Happy Meal toys for 10 cents each. The law, which goes into effect on December 1, requires that restaurant kids’ meals meet certain nutritional standards before they could be sold with free toys. McDonald’s and other major restaurant chains would have had to reduce sugar, fat and salt in their kids’ meals, while adding fruits and vegetables, to comply with the law. “Rather than fight city hall, I am complying with the letter of the law,” said McDonald’s franchisee Scott Rodrick, who owns just over half of the 19 McDonald’s franchises in San Francisco. Rodrick and other San Francisco franchisees — with the company’s blessing — plan to charge 10 cents to add a toy to the company’s popular Happy Meals for children. The toys are not offered for sale without the purchase of a Happy Meal, the company said. Proceeds from the San Francisco toy sales will be used to help build a new Ronald McDonald House in the city. Those facilities, which are operated by a McDonald’s charity, give free or low-cost housing to families seeking treatment for a sick child. McDonald’s was a pioneer in using free toys to promote kids’ meals and its success spawned me-too offerings from other chains. It debuted the Happy Meal in the United States in 1979 with toys like the “McDoodler” stencil and the “McWrist” wallet. Modern offerings have included themed items from popular films like “Shrek” or sought-after toys like Lego or Ty Beanie Babies. San Francisco late last year became the first major U.S. city to take on the toy giveaways, following a similar move by nearby Santa Clara County. Under pressure from San Francisco and other cities, McDonald’s and other restaurant chains have taken small steps to improve the nutritional profile of their meals for children. McDonald’s is giving its Happy Meals a makeover — reducing the french fry portion by more than half and adding apple slices. Those new Happy Meals already are sold in California and will be available in all the 14,000 U.S. McDonald’s restaurants early next year. But the new Happy Meal still doesn’t meet San Francisco’s nutritional guidelines, which were based on recommendations from the National Academies’ Institute of Medicine. San Francisco Supervisor Eric Mar, who sponsored the San Francisco ordinance, said he still sees the law as a victory — despite the maneuver from McDonald’s. “Our little local law had a major impact on the whole fast-food industry,” said Mar. “It’s going to be slow, but at least we feel that we’re moving them in the right direction.” Representatives from the Center for Science and the Public Interest and Corporate Accountability International were less charitable, calling the move by the world’s largest fast-food chain “cynical.” Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at CSPI, said McDonald’s response “clearly skirts the whole spirit of the law.” Wootan added that McDonald’s has the creative muscle to come up with healthy alternatives that appeal to children. “McDonald’s knows how to make food fun,” she said. “They just need to try to maker healthier food fun for kids — use that marketing brilliance that they have to promote health instead of undermine it.” While cities and communities around the country have expressed interest in passing similar laws, McDonald’s said it has no plans to challenge San Francisco’s law. “Certainly this is a smarter public relations move than a lawsuit,” said Sara Deon, director of Corporate Accountability International’s “Value the Meal” campaign.

Shares rose 1.4 percent to $97.84 in premarket trading after hitting a yearly high on Wednesday. The world’s biggest hamburger chain said on Thursday that sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 7.4 percent globally. Analysts were looking for an increase of 4.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. In Europe, where the chain gets some 40 percent of revenues, same-restaurant sales rose 6.5 percent, while analysts expected a jump of 3.8 percent. “The consumer is strong enough to accept the premium products,” said Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matthew DiFrisco, noting the popularity of McDonald’s more expensive coffee products. Britain, France, Russia and Germany were standout markets, McDonald’s said in a statement. Europe is struggling and investors worry a slowdown there could threaten the global economy. The United States continues to grapple with stubbornly high unemployment and other economic problems. And, China’s red-hot growth is cooling slightly. The company leads the fast-food industry and has been increasing its dominance over hamburger chains including Wendy’s Co and Burger King Corp by attracting a broader range of diners than fast food’s typical young adult males. It has done that by adding new menu items like smoothies and Angus burgers, extending operating hours, renovating restaurants and flexing its purchasing and marketing muscle. “The combination of product and investing in the store seems to be what is driving the top line outperformance,” DiFrisco said. U.S. november same-restaurant sales were up 6.5 percent, above analysts’ expectations for a rise of 4.2 percent. Sales in its Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit rose 8.1 percent, beating analysts’ call for a 4.9 percent increase. In all regions, same-restaurant sales rose more than they did in November 2010.

A spokeswoman for McDonald’s China told Reuters the comnpany had no plans to raise prices on the mainland for now. She said it last raised prices in China in July but did not elaborate. High food prices have topped policy makers’ agendas because of worries over the impact on inflation and potential unrest.

Hong Kong’s consumer prices in November rose 5.7 percent from a year earlier, while overall food prices surged 8.2 percent.

122,MCD,McDonald's extends Olympic sponsorship to 2020,"LONDON (Reuters) - Fast food chain McDonald’s has signed up to sponsor the Olympics for a further eight years, meaning athletes and fans will be offered its burgers and fries in the official restaurants at Games venues until 2020. The value of the new deal was not given but it was likely to be about $200 million based on what sponsors have paid in the past. McDonald’s is the seventh major company to agree to support the Games until 2020. “We are delighted that McDonald’s, our long-time and valued Olympic Partner for more than 35 years, is continuing its ongoing commitment not only to help fund the Olympic Games but also to support the Olympic Movement around the world and ultimately the athletes themselves,” IOC President Jacques Rogge said in a statement on Friday. The agreement was signed at the world youth Olympic Games in the Austrian city of Innsbruck. The move will help boost McDonald’s brand in fast-growing economies, with the 2014 Winter Games to be held in the Russian city of Sochi and the 2016 summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The 2018 Winter Games will be held in Pyeongchang, South Korea, with the 2020 summer venue yet to be decided. The IOC does not want to see deals go past 2020 because it plans to review its sponsorship program beyond that date to take account of developments in technology. The IOC received revenues of $957 million from its 11 leading sponsors for the Winter Games in 2010 in Vancouver and the Olympics in London this year.

124,MCD,Local firms vie for Yum's slice of the China market,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Four floors up overlooking the bustle of the cavernous Joy City Mall in Beijing, diners take a break from shopping to slurp noodles and nibble on dumplings at an Ajisen restaurant. It’s an increasingly common sight: Chinese consumers turning to local fast-food alternatives to the long-dominant pair in China — Yum Brands Inc’s (YUM.N) KFC and McDonalds Corp (MCD.N). Twenty-five years after Yum introduced China to American-style fast food with its first fried chicken store, the two U.S. giants are facing a plethora of Chinese and Asian eatery chains that are steadily munching away at their market share. As Yum prepares to announce fourth-quarter earnings on Monday, some investors are eyeing its China operations warily. Last week saw a flurry of put options on Yum after McDonalds reported earnings and said foreign exchange fluctuations and other factors could eat into profits in 2012. But Yum’s China business seems robust. The company said on December 5 that it expects a benefit of $40 million this year from yuan-dollar exchange rates, while operating profit in China is expected to grow 15 percent. It plans to open 600 more locations in China in 2012 at a pace of more than one every day. China accounted for 36 percent of Yum’s global revenue in 2010 and is estimated to be 44 percent in 2011 and 50 percent in 2012, according to Credit Suisse. Yum’s biggest challenge comes from a rising torrent of competition as Chinese consumers increasingly have more money to spend and more places to spend it, which could mean slowing growth rates for Yum in the future. At the Ajisen outlet, stacked above a Starbucks coffee shop and a Burger King restaurant, shoppers headed in and out all afternoon. “We were just browsing, and stopped here by chance to eat,” said Sun Haihao, 30, an engineer from Sichuan province who was visiting Beijing. He’s been to Ajisen, a Japanese-style restaurant run by Ajisen (China) holdings Ltd (0538.HK) and KFC in Mianyang city where he lives. “KFC can be too oily,” Sun said. “Ajisen is Asian, so we’re used to it.” A recent Reuters poll showed that economists expect China’s GDP to grow 8.4 percent this year, down from 9.2 percent in 2011. Meanwhile the quick-service restaurant industry is expected to grow around 15 percent, meaning further revenue growth for Yum and McDonalds, even as their market share declines, according to market research firm Mintel. “KFC and McDonalds are growing outlet numbers, but so are domestic and foreign chains plus independents,” says Paul French, Mintel’s chief China analyst. “The pie is bigger, but the number of players wanting and getting a slice of it are bigger too. A rising tide does not necessarily raise all boats.” Ajisen is among the legion of upstarts, which include fellow Japanese entrant Yoshinoya (9861.T); Taiwan-owned Dico’s restaurants and 85 Degrees Bakery; Burger King BKCBK.UL, Dairy Queen and Papa John’s Pizza (PZZA.O) from the United States; South Korean-owned Paris Baguette and Tous Les Jours bakeries; and a host of Chinese chains such as Golden Jaguar, Yonghe King and Country Style Cooking CCSC.N. Many are growing fast, albeit from a smaller base. Ajisen (China) reported a boost in first-half restaurant income last August of 40.8 percent to HK$1.6 billion ($206 million). Country Style Cooking, a family-style chain offering casual cuisine and focused on western China, increased its locations by 63 percent in 2011, according to China Market Research. Meanwhile, the number of all of Yum brand restaurants in China last year grew 13 percent. Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum, whose restaurants in China also include Pizza Hut, East Dawning and a stake in Little Sheep, plus Taco Bell and others in the United States, has had remarkable success in China. It was the first foreign fast-food restaurant chain to set up business here, opening a fried chicken outlet in Beijing in 1987. Today it is by far the largest with nearly 3,500 KFC locations across China, and more than 4,200 restaurants in all, well ahead of McDonalds’ 1,400 locations. “KFC restaurants are more profitable than any of its competitors and generate about four times as much revenue per restaurant as its U.S. locations,” says James Roy, senior analyst at China Market Research, a Shanghai-based consultancy. “No other competitor can come close to adding the number of restaurants per year it can,” Roy said. Yum itself said at the end of the third quarter, “We consider China to be the greatest restaurant opportunity of the 21st century.” Yum executives were not available to comment further because of the regulatory quiet period before the earnings announcement. Yum’s 2011 China revenue to be announced on Monday is expected to rise 23.3 percent, a slower pace from 32.6 percent a year before, according to Credit Suisse. But China is Yum’s growth engine. The company’s chief executive, David Novak, said in December that he expects China to lead global profit gains, projected to be up 13 percent for 2011 “despite our disappointing U.S. results” and up 10 percent for 2012, excepting special items. Rising affluence of the Chinese consumer is behind China’s flourishing casual dining market, according to Yuval Atsmon, a Shanghai-based consultant with McKinsey & Co. “Look at the population of the upper middle class with an income of more than 100,000 RMB ($15,800) a year. It’s now 15-20 million households, but it will be over 75 million households in five years,” Atsmon says.

128,MCD,McDonald's vows to stop pork suppliers confining sows in crates,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp said on Monday it will work with its U.S. pork suppliers to phase out the use of gestation crates, the cramped stalls that millions of mother sows are confined to while they raise piglets. The fast-food chain said the metal crates were “not a sustainable production system for the future.” It said it would work with suppliers to hammer out a timeline for the phase-out and would talk about the planned next steps in May. “There are alternatives that we think are better for the welfare of sows,” Dan Gorsky, senior vice president for supply chain management for McDonald’s North American said in a statement. McDonald’s joins a growing list of food producers and retailers, including Smithfield Foods, Hormel, Cargill, Burger King and Wolfgang Puck, that have promised to move away from pork bred from sows confined to the crates, which are typically too narrow to allow the sows to turn around. But because McDonald’s, which uses ham, sausage and bacon in its breakfast menu, is so big, Wayne Pacelle, the president and he chief executive officer of the Humane Society of the United States, predicted the announcement would have a “catalytic” impact on holdouts. “They’re clearly the biggest pork buyer in the fast-food sector and the largest restaurant chain in the world,” Pacelle said. “So this will certainly have seismic effect within the pork industry.” The National Pork Board, a trade group representing the pork industry, released a statement defending the stalls as a “conventional” practice. It said that alternatives, including open pens, free-access stalls and pastures, have “welfare advantages and disadvantages that must be considered by an individual farmer.” Sows are often confined in the crates from just before the birth of the piglets until they are weaned months later. Defenders of the practice said that it minimizes the number of tiny piglets crushed by the huge sows in the first days of life. Opponents said it is cruel to keep the mothers so confined for weeks at a time. The Humane Society said that 70 percent of the pork industry confines its pregnant pigs to gestation crates, which are banned in the European Union and eight U.S. states — including California, Ohio and Michigan. McDonald’s vow to help put an end to the sow crates is the latest in a string of victories for advocates of animal welfare and food purity. Last August, McDonald’s stopped putting beef trimmings treated with ammonia hydroxide — a USDA-approved ingredient that critics called “pink slime” — into its burgers after a number of food activists, including celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, drew attention to the additive. Also last summer, the Humane Society and U.S. egg producers agreed to work together to essentially double the size of the cages that the 280 million hens involved in U.S. egg production spend their lives in. Late last month, an amendment to the Egg Products Inspection Act legislating the increased cage size was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Humane Society and the egg industry issued a release calling the measure “a top legislative priority.” ",2132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-pork/mcdonalds-vows-to-stop-pork-suppliers-confining-sows-in-crates-idUSTRE81C1YP20120213
129,MCD,RPT-McDonald's plans to expand franchising in China,"SHANGHAI, Feb 28 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp, the world’s biggest hamburger chain said it plans to increase the number of franchised stores in China as it ramps up expansion in one of the world’s fastest-growing consumer markets. McDonald’s relies heavily on franchises in more mature markets such as the United States, but has almost exclusively opened self-operated stores in China since entering the market two decades ago. It has 36 franchised stores in the country, the company’s website showed. “Right now, it’s a low percentage. But I think that over a very short time, you can get to quite a good mix of stores being franchised,” McDonald’s China Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Chan told reporters on the sidelines of a conference on Tuesday, without giving specific targets. “At the end of the day, McDonald’s is a franchise company,” he said, stressing though that the pace of franchising in China depends largely on whether the company can find the right partners. McDonald’s lags rival Yum Brands Inc in opening outlets in China. Yum has opened about 4,500 restaurants under brands including KFC, Pizza Hut, East Dawning and Little Sheep in the country, which is now Yum’s biggest earnings driver. In comparison, McDonald’s owns more than 1,400 restaurants in China, and ranks the country as its third-biggest market in the world. In a bid to compete for market share, McDonald’s opened a record 200 new stores in China last year, and has unveiled plans to boost investment in the country by 50 percent in 2012, aiming to open another 225-250 new outlets this year. In addition to store expansion, building customer loyalty is also important to gaining market share, Chan said. “We’re not looking to be the largest in terms of the number of restaurants ... but we want to be the best-quality, best-service restaurant,” he said. “Thus, we will get more market share versus our competitors  even though we have fewer restaurants.” To lure more customers, McDonald’s has over the past few years made its food more affordable in China despite inflation and adapted its menus to local taste. “It’s not about trying to grow at breakneck pace, but at a pace that .... can be sustainable in the long term,” Chan said.",2282012,http://www.reuters.com/article/china-mcdonalds/rpt-mcdonalds-plans-to-expand-franchising-in-china-idUSL4E8DR89520120228

131,MCD,"Banks lift Wall Street, breaking 3-day skid","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks broke a three-day losing streak on Wednesday, recovering some recent losses after a report showed the U.S. private sector added more jobs than expected last month. After suffering their worst decline in three months on Tuesday, stocks received an early lift after payroll processor ADP said U.S. private employers picked up the pace of hiring in February. A report from The Wall Street Journal saying the U.S. Federal Reserve is considering a new type of mortgage and Treasury bond-buying program boosted stocks, particularly the financials. Banking stocks - Tuesday’s big losers - were the strongest sector on Wednesday. The KBW bank index .BKX advanced 1.9 percent. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) gained 3.2 percent to $17.88 following a 5.3 percent drop in the previous session. “Earlier in the week, portfolio managers, advisors and institutional money managers were looking for some sort of pullback just because it’s good to buy on the dip, and we’ve had such a nice run,” said Mark Martiak,, senior wealth strategist at Premier Financial Advisors in New York. “The right part of the economic good news, good data story was the private sector adding 216,000 jobs.” The news comes after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke stirred caution among many in financial markets last week by giving no clear indication that he plans to spur faster growth by pushing for another round of asset purchases, or quantitative easing. Improving economic figures have helped push the S&P; 500 up more than 20 percent from the October closing low. Investors continued to eye signs of progress in negotiations between fiscally troubled Greece and private creditors that will result in a substantial write-down for Greece’s debt costs. Tuesday’s tumble was prompted by renewed concerns about Greece and the outlook for the global economy. It was one of the worst performances since stocks began rallying in October and the third straight decline for the S&P; 500. Six Greek pension funds are still holding out against joining the deal while eight have agreed to take part. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 78.18 points, or 0.61 percent, to 12,837.33 at the close. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX climbed 9.27 points, or 0.69 percent, to 1,352.63. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC added 25.37 points, or 0.87 percent, to 2,935.69. The PHLX housing sector index .HGX advanced 2.7 percent, with Hovnanian Enterprises (HOV.N) up 2.5 percent at $2.46 after posting results. Apple shares were volatile as the company unveiled its latest iPad, which commands upwards of two-thirds of the growing tablet market. Apple shares fluctuated between gains and losses after the reveal, closing up just 0.08 percent at $530.69. Earlier in the session, Apple’s stock had gained as much as 1.4 percent to reach an intraday high at $537.78. Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc (FCX.N) fell 1.1 percent to $38.99 and Newmont Mining Corp (NEM.N) slipped 0.9 percent to $56.68 after Indonesia announced new rules to take more profits from vast mineral resources by limiting foreign ownership of mines.

Investors kept an eye on oil prices after France voiced skepticism that a planned revival of talks between six world powers and Iran over its nuclear program would succeed.

133,MCD,"McDonald's February sales miss target, Europe blamed","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) on Thursday reported global February sales that missed Wall Street’s target as analysts underestimated what effect Europe’s harsh winter and economic upheaval would have on sales. The company also warned that economic uncertainty could have an impact on profit growth, sending its shares down more than 3 percent. The results showed that the world’s biggest hamburger chain, which has outperformed most of its peers despite worldwide financial turmoil, is not immune to fiscal belt-tightening in Europe and higher food and labor costs in the United States. “These challenges are expected to impact the company’s first-quarter operating income growth,” McDonald’s said in a statement. “I was not expecting to read that sentence in this report,” Victory Capital Management analyst Dave Kolpak said. “We’ve gotten used to being blown away with upside surprises” in McDonald’s monthly same-restaurant sales. McDonald’s does not give quarterly earnings guidance and company representatives declined to elaborate. TOPSY-TURVY MONTH McDonald’s on Thursday reported a 7.5 percent gain in February sales at global restaurants open at least 13 months. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were looking for a worldwide sales gain of 7.7 percent, while those polled by Consensus Metrix had expected a gain of 8.2 percent. Sales would have been even lower, but this Leap Year, in which February had 29 days, about 3 percentage points were added to the sales gain, McDonald’s said. Europe, which just edges out the United States as McDonald’s biggest market for revenue, saw sales rise 4 percent. Analysts were expecting the region to gain more than 6 percent. Deadly frigid temperatures hurt sales across Europe, where top performers included Britain and Russia. “We think Wall Street was underestimating the effect of the cold snap in Europe,” said Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski, who was expecting European same-restaurant sales to rise 5 percent in February. Kalinowski has a “buy” rating on McDonald’s stock and was advising clients to pick up shares on Thursday’s dip. McDonald’s is not alone in reporting weakness from the region. Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), Gap Inc (GPS.N) and some other large consumer-focused U.S. companies were also feeling the pinch of European debt woes and austerity measures. Sales in its Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa units rose just 2.4 percent, missing analysts’ calls for an increase of about 8 percent. Japan, which is still recovering from last year’s massive earthquake and tsunami, reported a 1.2 percent decline in February same-restaurant sales. A shift in the timing of the Chinese New Year also pulled down results in the region. Same-restaurant sales in the United States jumped 11.1 percent, far better than the roughly 8 percent gain expected by analysts. Domestic sales got a boost from Chicken McBites, beverages, breakfast and Filet-O-Fish sandwiches. Analysts said the U.S. results showed that McDonald’s continues to steal market share. McDonald’s has a broad menu — including $1 hamburgers, salads, espresso coffee drinks and “premium” Angus burgers — that appeals to a wider range of customers than the young men who typically frequent other fast-food chains. It also uses its massive size to negotiate lower costs for food and other items. That has helped the company outpace direct rivals such as Burger King BKCBK.UL and Wendy’s Co (WEN.O). “It’s still outperforming everybody,” Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said. McDonald’s shares were down 3.3 percent, or $3.35, at $96.83 in afternoon New York Stock exchange trading.

137,MCD,McDonald's shuffles US menu in value makeover,"* Small french fries, drinks to fall off Dollar Menus * Adding new “Extra Value Menu” from existing items By Lisa Baertlein March 8 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp  restaurants in the United States will be tweaking and expanding their promoted value-priced items later this month as many diners remain strapped for cash and the world’s biggest hamburger chain works to increase its lead over rivals. McDonald’s will change national advertising for its Dollar Menu, removing small drinks and small french fries and replacing those items with fresh baked cookies and ice cream cones, Neil Golden, chief marketing officer for McDonald’s USA, told Reuters in an interview. Restaurant operators, who bear more of the brunt of higher food costs, often follow suit. On March 26, McDonald’s also will debut an “Extra Value Menu”. That menu will include 20-piece chicken McNuggets, double cheeseburgers, chicken snack wraps, Angus snack wraps, medium iced coffees and snack-sized McFlurries, plus up to four regional options, that were previously listed elsewhere on its menu. “The choices have been available for quite some time, we’re just making it easier for customers to find them and enjoy them,” Golden said, adding that the prices on those items will not change. All Extra Value Menu items will be priced above $1 and many will be below $2. Clay Paschen, who owns 16 McDonald’s restaurants in Southern California in partnership with his father and brother, participated in Extra Value Menu testing. “The Dollar Menu is still king ... and will continue to be a foundation for us. We are using and need both of them to continue our strategies,” Paschen said. In addition to the Dollar Menu and the new Extra Value Menu, McDonald’s offers Extra Value Meals. McDonald’s separately has been taking steps to both reinforce its core brand and burnish its image. To that end, it is promoting its mainstay Big Mac hamburger. At the same time, it is advertising the fruit and other healthier items in its Happy Meals after sidestepping a battle over its use of toys to market meals to children. Additionally, the company has been running ads about the farmers who provide its potatoes and other ingredients to promote the quality of its food. McDonald’s has a broad menu - including $1 hamburgers, salads, espresso coffee drinks and “premium” Angus burgers - that appeals to a wider range of customers than the young men who typically frequent other fast-food chains. It uses its massive size to negotiate lower costs for food and other items that its rivals. All of those efforts put the heat on other fast-food chains, many of which do not have the resources to match McDonald’s blow-for-blow, said Bob Goldin, an executive vice president at consulting firm Technomic. McDonald’s U.S. share of the informal dining market was 12.5 percent in November 2011, according to NPD Crest. That was up from 11.8 percent in November 2010. “They’ve got their competitors on the ropes,” Technomic’s Goldin said. “This is where being an 800-pound gorilla is really paying off.”",3082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/mcdonalds/mcdonalds-shuffles-us-menu-in-value-makeover-idUSL2E8E72GW20120308
138,MCD,China probes McDonald's outlet over quality,"BEIJING, March 16 (Reuters) - China’s food safety authorities said on Friday that they were probing a Beijing outlet of McDonald’s Corp, the world’s biggest hamburger chain, after a report on state television pointed to quality problems there. The CCTV report said the Sanlitun branch was selling food which had passed its expiry date, according to the official Xinhua news agency. China’s State Food and Drug Administration has asked the Beijing health bureau to investigate, and demanded McDonald’s learn lessons from the incident and take steps to prevent it from happening again, the watchdog said in a statement on its website (www.sda.gov.cn). McDonald’s ranks China as its third biggest market and has 1,400 restaurants there. “All McDonald’s (China) outlets must seriously carry out a full investigation on themselves in accordance with the demands of food safety laws and regulations for the food and beverage industry,” it said. McDonald’s said in a statement on its China website (www.mcdonalds.com.cn) that it was paying attention to the incident, and apologised to customers. “Although this is a single incident, it is against McDonald’s operating standards and is totally unacceptable. We will immediately start investigation on this store and will mete out severe punishment,” it said. Xinhua added that the branch in question had been shut.

143,MCD,"Wall Street mostly slips, but tech keeps S&P; near 4-year highs","NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks mostly fell on Wednesday, weighed by the energy services sector, but gains in technology shares buoyed the Nasdaq and helped keep the S&P; 500 near four-year highs. The benchmark S&P; 500 index, up 11.6 percent so far this quarter, found buyers at the 1,400 level, which has been held for five straight days. Support at that level suggests more gains in coming weeks. The technology sector rose again, with the Nasdaq 100 technology index .NDXT up 0.4 percent for the day and up close to 18 percent this year. It helped the broader Nasdaq Composite edge up for the day. “What we’re seeing is a rolling correction. Different industry groups are correcting while others are showing strength,” said Paul Nolte, managing director at Dearborn Partners in Chicago. “Equity markets are being held up in general by the technology group.” A string of upbeat U.S. economic data in recent weeks has fueled the market’s surge, and pullbacks have been brief. Since a three-day decline two weeks ago, the S&P; 500 has not lost more than 0.3 percent in one session. The PHLX Oil Services index .OSX fell 1.9 percent after Baker Hughes BHI.N said it expects first-quarter profit margins to fall sharply. Its stock fell 5.8 percent to $45.04, its lowest close since mid-December. The S&P; 500 energy sector index .GSPE was off 1 percent. In a report on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs said the prospects for future returns in equities relative to bonds are as good as they have been in a generation. “Given current valuations, we think it’s time to say a ‘long good bye’ to bonds, and embrace the ‘long good buy’ for equities as we expect them to embark on an upward trend over the next few years,” Goldman Sachs said. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 45.57 points, or 0.35 percent, to 13,124.62 at the close. The S&P; 500 Index .INX dipped 2.63 points, or 0.19 percent, to 1,402.89. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC edged up 1.17 points, or 0.04 percent, to 3,075.32. Volume was low, with just over 6 billion shares traded on the New York Stock exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, compared with the 6.87 billion daily average so far this year. Advancing issues were almost evenly matched with decliners on both the NYSE and the Nasdaq. Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) said it was merging its printer and PC businesses in a major reorganization to save costs and boost growth. The stock, a Dow component, fell 2.2 percent to $23.46. Oracle Corp ORCL.O shares fell 2.3 percent to $29.41 after climbing to a session high at $31.15 earlier. The world’s No. 3 software maker beat Wall Street’s earnings estimates as a sharp drop in hardware revenue was offset by new software sales. The Nasdaq got a lift from Green Mountain Coffee Roasters GMCR.O shares, which shot up 10 percent to $55.79 after the company said it will carry Starbucks-branded coffee in packs designed for its new line of brewers, boosting its efforts to protect its lead in the U.S. single-cup coffee market. Earlier, data showed U.S. home sales fell in February, but upward revisions to January’s pace and the first yearly increase in prices in 15 months suggested the recovery in the housing market remained on track. An index of housing stocks .HGX rose 0.5 percent and is up 26.6 percent so far this quarter. The U.S. stock market’s recovery started last October as investors saw ways to avoid a worst-case scenario in the European debt crisis that threatened the global economic recovery. But analysts see a shift in investor sentiment that could translate into more market gains. “We believe that the bull market is transitioning from an advance based on crisis resolution toward one driven by expanding risk appetite stemming from mounting evidence of a more durable, self-sustaining economic expansion,” said Carmine Grigoli, chief investment strategist at Mizuho Securities USA, in a note to clients.

144,MCD,McDonald's CEO Jim Skinner to retire,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) Chief Executive Jim Skinner, who took the top post at the world’s biggest hamburger chain following the abrupt departures of two CEOs, is retiring after more than seven years as a stabilizing force at the helm. In what analysts expected to be a smooth transition, Chief Operating Officer Don Thompson, 48, will succeed Skinner, effective July 1, becoming one of the most prominent African-American CEOs in the United States. Skinner, 67, has led McDonald’s since November 2004 and is widely credited with executing the turn-around of the ubiquitous fast-food chain, whose shares more than tripled while he was CEO. He also will resign from the board of McDonald’s. The company did not give a reason for Skinner’s departure, but analysts said the move, while not entirely a surprise, came earlier than expected. “My suspicion is that he thinks the company is in a really good spot ... and that with Don, the company is in good hands. He’s done what he set out to do,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Larry Miller. “Jim’s not going to hang around. That’s his style,” Miller said, referring to him as a no-nonsense CEO. Analysts said Thompson - who previously oversaw the company’s U.S. operation and is credited with its widely successful domestic roll-outs of lattes, frappes and other beverages - should be up to the task. “Don Thompson has proven himself to be an excellent operator and a strong manager, which should help assuage investor concerns,” Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said. “Everything Don’s done has been a home run,” RBC Capital Markets’ Miller said. “I don’t see McDonald’s missing a beat.” Shares in the company barely budged in extended trading following the news, slipping 0.1 percent to $96.60. Skinner began his career as a restaurant manager trainee in Illinois and quickly worked his way up the ranks of the company’s U.S. unit. He joined the McDonald’s international management team in 1992 and was vice chairman in charge of McDonald’s operations in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America when he was promoted to CEO - the company’s third in one year. McDonald’s Chief Executive Jim Cantalupo died of a heart attack in April 2004, shortly before he was to speak to thousands of McDonald’s owners and operators. His successor Charlie Bell was diagnosed with colorectal cancer just weeks into his tenure and stepped down in November that same year. Skinner wasn’t in the post long when “Super Size Me”, a scathing documentary about McDonald’s and the fast-food industry, hit theaters. The company ended the practice of super-sizing after a public outcry. It also expanded its menu with low-priced and “premium” food, extended operating hours and remodeled units, moves that contributed to a nearly nine-year run of rising sales at established restaurants. Thompson, a Purdue University alumnus, takes the No. 1 job at a time when the company, valued at close to $100 billion, is outpacing competitors and its stock is trading near record highs. The Chicago native joined McDonald’s in 1990 as an electrical engineer. He climbed the ranks to become the company’s U.S. president before his elevation to COO in 2010, after which he oversaw overall strategy and operations for more than 30,000 restaurants across the globe. When Thompson - who is often hailed as an African-American role model - was appointed COO, some on Wall Street saw him as a clear front runner to one day run the company.

147,MCD,NEWSMAKER-McDonald's new CEO Thompson a study in contrasts,"March 22 (Reuters) - Don Thompson’s journey to the top spot at McDonald’s Corp started in front of a computer, not a deep fryer. For many executives at McDonald’s, including retiring CEO Jim Skinner, the first rung on the corporate ladder began in a restaurant — logging long hours flipping burgers, bagging fries and manning busy drive-thru windows. Thompson, an electrical engineer recruited in 1990 from the fighter jet maker that is now Northrop Grumman Corp, got his start designing robotic equipment for transporting food and making control circuits for cooking equipment. People who know the man set to become McDonald’s first African-American chief executive on July 1 say he possesses the relatively rare mix of social prowess and sophisticated mathematical skills. “Don is very intelligent, he’s very strategic — and he’s tactful. You don’t often find tact in the people who are intelligent and strategic,” said John Kendall, a Chicago patent attorney who met Thompson at an event for the historic black fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha when they were attending neighboring colleges, and also worked with him at Northrop. As the new chief of the world’s biggest fast-food chain, Thompson, 48, faces the challenge of adding to nearly nine years of sales gains at established restaurants. Wall Street gives him high marks for overseeing the successful U.S. McCafe roll-out of lattes, frappes and other beverages. He also flexed his operational muscle in various U.S. roles along his path, measuring store performance with an engineer’s zeal and using the resulting statistics to tweak operations. But some investors worry that Thompson, who has never had an international posting, is taking the helm at a time when the company’s overseas business has never been more important. McDonald’s faces a potential slowdown in debt-troubled Europe, the company’s biggest market for sales, and is pushing to grow in places like China, where rival Yum Brands Inc has a big lead. “He just doesn’t have as diverse of a set of experiences as some of his predecessors,” said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments, who has met Thompson. However, she said the company’s deep management bench likely would compensate: “I’m not troubled to the point where I would get out of the stock.” McDonald’s declined to make Thompson available for an interview. Thompson is described as soft-spoken without being a pushover, approachable and humble. Friends say he’s given to broad smiles, bear hugs and hearty handshakes. At Northrop, his league basketball team knew him as a player who cleared the way for his friends to shine. Today, he is poised to become one of the most powerful U.S. CEOs — and one of the few who are African-American. NBA star LeBron James, who is a forward for the Miami Heat and is featured in McDonald’s commercials, has high praise for Thompson. James, who has worked directly with the new CEO, told Reuters that Thompson is an “inspiration” and said McDonald’s is in good hands. “Don is an amazing leader who will make an incredible CEO. He is a friend, mentor, and business partner,” James said in an email. Roland Martin, a reporter, CNN political analyst and fellow  member of Alpha Phi Alpha, has known Thompson since the mid-2000s and calls the incoming CEO “one of the most down-to-earth brothers I’ve met.” Martin has seen Thompson, now McDonald’s chief operating officer, talk nuts-and-bolts with franchisees. He’s also been on the receiving end of the executive’s requests to talk about McDonald’s new oatmeal and espresso drinks on Twitter. “He’s really a personable guy — serious about his job, but certainly loves to have fun,” said Martin, who a couple of years ago spent a night hopping between two Atlanta parties with him. “We were dancing ... our wives were having a good time. Don wasn’t the guy who was standing on the walls saying, ‘No, no, no, no ... I’m on the path to be CEO of McDonald’s.’ He was right there.” Thompson moved from engineering to operations after just a few years at McDonald’s. He rose quickly through the ranks, holding key roles in the company’s West and Midwest divisions before being named McDonald’s USA president in 2006. Four years later, he was promoted to chief operating officer — a position seen as a stepping stone to the top job. Analysts and McDonald’s both say Thompson played an important part in executing the company’s “Plan to Win”, which has resulted in its best-ever financial performance. That strategy has included extending operating hours, sprucing up restaurants and expanding menus to include value-priced food, “premium” hamburgers and espresso drinks. Separately, McDonald’s has addressed concern over its role in the U.S. obesity crisis by adding a serving of apples and shrinking the french fry portion in its Happy Meals for children. Still, some worry that Thompson may not fully appreciate how things like menu changes play out in the real world. “There’s general concern that he doesn’t have any real restaurant experience,” said Richard Adams, a former McDonald’s franchise director and restaurant owner, who now advises McDonald’s franchisees. Sticking to McDonald’s current business strategy will be crucial to maintaining the chain’s lead over fast-food competitors and supporting the company’s stock price, which is trading near record levels. “If Don doesn’t try to change too many things too fast, he’ll be O.K.,” Adams said.",3232012,http://www.reuters.com/article/mcdonalds/newsmaker-mcdonalds-new-ceo-thompson-a-study-in-contrasts-idUSL1E8EMAPP20120323

As the new chief of the world’s biggest fast-food chain, Thompson, 48, faces the challenge of adding to nearly nine years of sales gains at established restaurants. Wall Street gives him high marks for overseeing the successful U.S. McCafe roll-out of lattes, frappes and other beverages. He also flexed his operational muscle in various U.S. roles along his path, measuring store performance with an engineer’s zeal and using the resulting statistics to tweak operations. But some investors worry that Thompson, who has never had an international posting, is taking the helm at a time when the company’s overseas business has never been more important. McDonald’s faces a potential slowdown in debt-troubled Europe, the company’s biggest market for sales, and is pushing to grow in places like China, where rival Yum Brands Inc has a big lead. “He just doesn’t have as diverse of a set of experiences as some of his predecessors,” said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments, who has met Thompson. However, she said the company’s deep management bench likely would compensate: “I’m not troubled to the point where I would get out of the stock.” McDonald’s declined to make Thompson available for an interview. Thompson is described as soft-spoken without being a pushover, approachable and humble. Friends say he’s given to broad smiles, bear hugs and hearty handshakes. At Northrop, his league basketball team knew him as a player who cleared the way for his friends to shine. Today, he is poised to become one of the most powerful U.S. CEOs — and one of the few who are African-American. NBA star LeBron James, who is a forward for the Miami Heat and is featured in McDonald’s commercials, has high praise for Thompson. James, who has worked directly with the new CEO, told Reuters that Thompson is an “inspiration” and said McDonald’s is in good hands. “Don is an amazing leader who will make an incredible CEO. He is a friend, mentor, and business partner,” James said in an email. Roland Martin, a reporter, CNN political analyst and fellow  member of Alpha Phi Alpha, has known Thompson since the mid-2000s and calls the incoming CEO “one of the most down-to-earth brothers I’ve met.” Martin has seen Thompson, now McDonald’s chief operating officer, talk nuts-and-bolts with franchisees. He has also been on the receiving end of the executive’s requests to talk about McDonald’s new oatmeal and espresso drinks on Twitter. “He’s really a personable guy — serious about his job, but certainly loves to have fun,” said Martin, who a couple of years ago spent a night hopping between two Atlanta parties with him. “We were dancing ... our wives were having a good time. Don wasn’t the guy who was standing on the walls saying, ‘No, no, no, no ... I’m on the path to be CEO of McDonald’s.’ He was right there.” Thompson moved from engineering to operations after just a few years at McDonald’s. He rose quickly through the ranks, holding key roles in the company’s West and Midwest divisions before being named McDonald’s USA president in 2006. Four years later, he was promoted to chief operating officer — a position seen as a stepping stone to the top job. Analysts and McDonald’s both say Thompson played an important part in executing the company’s “Plan to Win,” which has resulted in its best-ever financial performance. That strategy has included extending operating hours, sprucing up restaurants and expanding menus to include value-priced food, “premium” hamburgers and espresso drinks. Separately, McDonald’s has addressed concern over its role in the U.S. obesity crisis by adding a serving of apples and shrinking the french fry portion in its Happy Meals for children. Still, some worry that Thompson may not fully appreciate how things like menu changes play out in the real world. “There’s general concern that he doesn’t have any real restaurant experience,” said Richard Adams, a former McDonald’s franchise director and restaurant owner, who now advises McDonald’s franchisees. Sticking to McDonald’s current business strategy will be crucial to maintaining the chain’s lead over fast-food competitors and supporting the company’s stock price, which is trading near record levels. “If Don doesn’t try to change too many things too fast, he’ll be OK,” Adams said.",3252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/mcdonalds/rpt-newsmaker-mcdonalds-new-ceo-thompson-a-study-in-contrasts-idUSL2E8EP3UN20120325
150,MCD,RPT-NEWSMAKER-McDonald's new CEO Thompson a study in contrasts,"By Lisa Baertlein March 23 (Reuters) - Don Thompson’s journey to the top spot at McDonald’s Corp started in front of a computer, not a deep fryer. For many executives at McDonald’s, including retiring CEO Jim Skinner, the first rung on the corporate ladder began in a restaurant — logging long hours flipping burgers, bagging fries and manning busy drive-thru windows. Thompson, an electrical engineer recruited in 1990 from the fighter-jet maker that is now Northrop Grumman Corp, got his start designing robotic equipment for transporting food and making control circuits for cooking equipment.

151,MCD,McDonald's says coffee fuels its Canada turnaround,"* Chain launching smoothies in Canada * Breakfast sales up 45 pct over 3 years TORONTO, March 29 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s  Canadian market share is the highest it’s been in 15 years, and that’s mainly due to its humble drip coffee, the fast food giant’s Canadian chief says. Coffee isn’t an obvious point of entry in Canada, where doughnut and coffee chain Tim Hortons borders on a national symbol and Starbucks is also well-established. Mcdonald’s has been selling a “premium roast” blend coffee for five years, but McDonald’s Canada President John Betts says that a campaign to trumpet its quality has woken up the brand. “It all started with the coffee. That is the thing that’s turned our business around,” he told Reuters in an interview. “We’ve converted millions of people.” Betts is now on a media blitz promoting McDonald’s smoothies, new to Canada. It’s another product that puts the chain head-to-head with Tim Hortons, which launched its own smoothies a year ago. Betts said the fruit and yogurt smoothies offer “very good” margins, and are a logical extension of the McCafe espresso drinks that the chain rolled out across Canada in November. Tims launched similar beverages in Canada and the United States in December. In September, McDonald’s announced a $1 billion store revamp that is transforming its Canadian restaurants into something more coffee house than burger joint, with softer seating, free Internet and even flat screen televisions and fireplaces in some outlets. By April, about 65 percent of traditional restaurants will have been renovated, Betts said, and that figure will climb to more than 80 percent by the end of the year. While Betts is happy with the espresso launch and restaurant renovations, he says it’s the cheaper brewed coffee, which McDonald’s has promoted with high-profile ad campaigns and aggressive giveaways, that has fueled the chain’s sales growth. Betts said the coffee has helped boost breakfast sales 45 percent over the last three years, though he would not reveal market share figures. “We were kind of stalled, you know. We weren’t focused, we weren’t aligned, we weren’t that relevant to the customer,” Betts said of McDonald’s before it started pushing its new coffee hard. “We’re a mature market that got stalled a little, but we’re refreshing ourselves, and then things will take off from here.”",3292012,http://www.reuters.com/article/mcdonalds-canada/mcdonalds-says-coffee-fuels-its-canada-turnaround-idUSL2E8ET3X520120329

153,MCD,Judge tosses Happy Meal lawsuit against McDonald's,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A San Francisco judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit against McDonald’s over the restaurant chain’s marketing of its signature Happy Meals, according to court documents. McDonald’s was accused of unfairly using toys to lure children into its restaurants. The proposed class-action lawsuit in a California state court sought to stop the company from using free toys to promote its Happy Meals in the Golden State. The Happy Meal has been a huge hit for McDonald’s — making the company one of the world’s largest toy distributors — and spawning me-too offerings at most other fast-food chains. But it also has come under fire from public health officials, parents and lawmakers who are frustrated with rising childhood obesity rates and weak anti-obesity efforts from restaurant operators, which are largely self-regulated. Plaintiff Monet Parham, a mother of two, was represented by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition advocacy group. CSPI executive director Michael Jacobson said CSPI would discuss the possibility of an appeal with Parham. “In time, the practice of using toys to market junk food will seem as inappropriate and anachronistic as lead paint, child labor and asbestos,” Jacobson said. Court documents show that Judge Richard Kramer dismissed Parham’s claims on Wednesday, without giving her a chance to file an amended lawsuit. The documents do not contain any details of Kramer’s legal analysis. McDonald’s spokeswoman Danya Proud said the company was pleased with Kramer’s decision. “We are proud of our Happy Meals and will vigorously defend our brand, our reputation and our food,” Proud said.

156,MCD,McDonald's in franchising deal with Russia's Rosinter,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) will franchise out restaurants in Russia for the first time after picking the sector’s largest restaurant holding company Rosinter (ROST.MM) as its partner in the fast-growing market. McDonald’s, which relies heavily on franchises in more mature markets such as the United States, has so far been expanding in Russia through self-operated stores only. The agreement with Rosinter is aimed at “growth and expansion”, said Khamzat Khasbulatov, McDonald’s Russia president. “If this model proves successful, we will start to spread it around. We are looking at a long-term perspective,” he told Reuters, adding the model could in future help it to tap remote Russian regions such as the Far East. Western restaurant chains have made Russia a top priority as rising wages and consumer spending have increased growth prospects in the emerging market. The test project will see Rosinter open McDonald’s restaurants in airports and railway stations, said Khasbulatov. He refused to provide more details, saying only that expansion through self-operated restaurants remained a priority in Russia. McDonald’s, which first opened in Moscow in 1990, before the collapse of the Soviet Union, has 314 stores in Russia and plans to open 40-45 new self-operated locations each year. Rosinter already operates the T.G.I. Friday franchise in Russia and has a joint venture with Britain’s Whitbread (WTB.L) to develop its Costa Coffee brand. The agreement with Rosinter comes as more international restaurant chains flock into Russia. U.S. sandwich chain Quiznos unveiled a partnership with local franchisee QRL in March and said it would open more than 20 locations by 2014. Wendy’s/Arby’s WEN.N opened its first Russian restaurant last June in partnership with Russian company Wenrus, while Burger King entered the market in 2010.

160,MCD,"McDonald's profit boosted by U.S., Europe","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) reported higher quarterly profit on Friday, boosted by better-than-expected sales at established restaurants in the United States and its top revenue market of Europe. McDonald’s shares rose 2.1 percent as investors breathed a sigh of relief over results from Europe, where national debt woes, widespread austerity measures and high unemployment have made demand for American fast-food volatile. The first-quarter results, boosted by a focus on low-priced food, new menu items, restaurant makeovers and longer operating hours, helped McDonald’s continue to outpace rivals like Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and Burger King Corp BKCBK.UL. Sales at restaurants open at least 13 months were up 7.3 percent, more than the 6.7 percent increase expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix. Same-restaurant sales rose 5 percent in Europe and 8.9 percent in the United States, where mild weather has helped lift restaurant sales. “People have been most concerned about Europe and it looks like it’s OK,” said Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore. Investors had good reason for caution. McDonald’s global same-restaurant sales for February missed Wall Street’s target due to a harsh winter and economic upheaval in Europe. Europe’s results for March, reported on Friday, topped expectations as McDonald’s increased its focus on low-cost food offered via Germany’s “value menu” and the United Kingdom’s “saver menu.” “France is also evaluating options to further strengthen value perceptions at a time when a number of new austerity measures are impacting consumers’ confidence and their disposable income,” said Chief Operating Officer Don Thompson, who will succeed retiring Chief Executive Jim Skinner in July. McDonald’s rival Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N), parent of the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains, on Thursday said recent results in Europe were marked by choppiness and “some weakness. McDonald’s, the world’s biggest hamburger chain, expects its momentum to continue in April, and forecast a 4 percent rise in global same-restaurant sales for the month.

Revenue jumped 7 percent to $6.55 billion. In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA), first-quarter same-restaurant sales were up 5.5 percent, slightly less than the 5.9 percent analysts expected, due to lower franchise margins.

GE beat their number. Overall, it continues to be another good earnings season,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. “They are good signs the U.S. economy remains on track, it’s not super growth, but it’s growth.” Industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc  reported higher quarterly profit and raised its 2012 earnings forecast.

Net income at the world’s biggest fast-food chain rose to $1.27 billion, or $1.23 per share, during the first quarter, up from $1.21 billion, or $1.15 per share, a year earlier.

165,MCD,McDonald's April U.S. sales miss estimates,"(Reuters) - Neither premium chicken sandwiches nor Angus burgers could tempt U.S. consumers to spend more on higher-priced items at McDonald’s, as a tepid U.S. economic recovery kept restaurant spending in check. The world’s biggest hamburger chain on Tuesday reported a smaller-than-expected rise in April sales at established restaurants around the world, largely due to underperformance in the United States, where consumers continue to seek out very low-priced food. U.S. sales at McDonald’s Corp restaurants open at least 13 months rose 3.3 percent, less than the roughly 5 percent gain analysts’ expected. Global same-restaurant sales also were up 3.3 percent for April, falling short of the company’s own forecast for a 4 percent increase. McDonald’s issued its global sales forecast on April 20 and the final results suggested that U.S. momentum flagged late in the month. “First and foremost, the consumer continues to want value,” Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matthew DiFrisco told Reuters. Advertised premium chicken sandwiches and Angus burgers failed to meet sales targets, and it took longer than expected to roll out new blueberry banana nut oatmeal, Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said in a client note. McDonald’s also promoted new “Extra Value Menu” items and combo meals with prices above the offerings on its famed “Dollar Menu.” The new menu includes 20-piece chicken McNuggets, double cheeseburgers, chicken snack wraps, Angus snack wraps, medium iced coffees, and snack-sized McFlurries, plus up to four regional options that were previously listed elsewhere on its menu. “A relatively rare promotional misstep in the (United States) may have opened the door for competitors who have stepped up their competitive intensity,” Senatore said. The rivalry among U.S. fast-food chains is fierce and inflation at the grocery store is easing, making it harder for restaurants to raise prices to offset the higher cost of ingredients. Those challenges exert more pressure on smaller chains such as Wendy’s Co, which is the second-largest U.S. hamburger chain but just a fraction of the size of McDonald’s. Wendy’s reported first-quarter profit on Tuesday below Wall Street’s expectations due to the higher cost of fresh beef and a lower-than-expected same-restaurant sales gain of 0.8 percent at its company-operated North American restaurants. Wendy’s admitted to a pricing and marketing mishap during the quarter. The company had hoped that its $2.99 “W” hamburger promotion would spur diners to trade up from 99-cent hamburgers. The offer instead prompted customers to trade down from $3.49 Dave’s Hot ‘n Juicy hamburgers, which have less meat than the “W” burgers. “Those 99-cent shoppers are generally 99-cent shoppers, and you’re not likely to be able to move them up to that $2.99 price point,” Emil Brolick, Wendy’s president and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts. Wall Street may have gotten ahead of itself in terms of expectations because of McDonald’s stellar gains in recent months. “The momentum they’ve had has been very strong,” Steve West, a director at Investment Technology Group, told Reuters. While McDonald’s is outperforming most of its peers, it also is sensitive to financial belt-tightening in Europe and higher food and labor costs in the United States. Despite national debt woes, widespread austerity measures and high unemployment in Europe, McDonald’s same-restaurant sales in its top market rose 3.5 percent, above analysts’ average forecast of just over 3 percent, according to average estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters and Consensus Metrix. McDonald’s said its major European markets — France, Britain, Germany and Russia — each contributed to the rise. Promotions and restaurant renovations bolstered sales in the region. In Asia, McDonald’s same-restaurant sales were up just 1.1 percent, below analysts’ estimates, hurt by a drop in Japan. McDonald’s shares closed down 2.1 percent at $93.55, while shares of Wendy’s fell 4.1 percent to $4.67. DiFrisco said investors may recalibrate near-term growth assumptions for McDonald’s after the April same-store sales results. But, given the company’s strength over rivals and other factors, he said, “There’s still more upside than downside at these levels.” ",5082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds/mcdonalds-april-u-s-sales-miss-estimates-idUSBRE8470K320120508

170,MCD,Anti-obesity proposal fails again at McDonald's,"OAK BROOK, Ill., May 24 - McDonald’s Corp investors soundly rejected a shareholder proposal that would have required the world’s biggest fast-food chain to assess its impact on childhood obesity. The subject was a major topic of discussion at Thursday’s annual shareholder meeting, which also served as a send-off for retiring Chief Executive Jim Skinner - whose nearly eight years at the helm will be remembered as a time when the price of McDonald’s stock tripled. The shareholder proposal, which also failed last year, returned amid growing concern over the social and financial costs of obesity in the United States and around the world - not only in terms of healthcare-related expenses but also lower worker productivity and diminished quality of life. Nearly one-third of U.S. children are overweight or obese. America is one of the fattest nations on earth, and the Institute of Medicine, in a 2006 report requested by Congress, said junk food marketing contributes to an epidemic of childhood obesity that continues to rise. The institute is the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences. McDonald’s executives on Thursday defended the brand and its advertising. “We’re proud of the changes we’ve made to our menu. We’ve done more than anybody in the industry around fruits and vegetables and variety and choice,” said Skinner, who will retire on June 30 and who received a standing ovation from investors. McDONALD’S HEALTH FOOTPRINT As one of the largest and most influential companies in the restaurant industry, McDonald’s often bears the brunt of criticism from consumers, parents and healthcare professionals, who want it to serve healthier food and curb its marketing to children. While the chain has added food like salads, oatmeal and smoothies to its menu, it has pulled ahead of rivals and delivered outsized returns for investors with help from its core lineup of fatty food and sugary drinks. Corporate Accountability International, a business watchdog group, for the second year in a row backed the obesity proposal, which was endorsed by 2,500 pediatricians, cardiologists and other healthcare professionals. It called on the company to issue a report on its “health footprint.” The document would evaluate how diet-related illness would affect McDonald’s profit. In the time since the last shareholder vote, McDonald’s has changed the contents of its popular Happy Meals for children - reducing the french fry portion by more than half and automatically including apples in every meal. It also won the dismissal of a lawsuit that sought to stop the company from using free toys to promote its Happy Meals for children in California. Dr Andrew Bremer, a pediatric endocrinologist and professor at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, presented the proposal at the meeting and said McDonald’s has chosen to employ “countless new PR tactics” that create a perception of change while “unreasonably” exposing shareholders to significant risk. “It is not enough to point to so-called healthier menu items when children are still the target of aggressive marketing of an overwhelming unhealthy brand,” Bremer said. McDonald’s board of directors recommended a “no” vote on the proposal, calling it “unnecessary and redundant.” Shareholders heeded that call. The proposal received 6.4 percent of votes in support, up from 5.6 percent a year ago. Incoming CEO Don Thompson, who said his two children eat at McDonald’s, was forceful in his response to questions from Corporate Accountability representatives. “I would never do anything to hurt them or any other children, nor would we as a corporation ... Do me the honor, and our entire organization, of not associating us with doing something that is damaging to children. We have been very responsible,” Thompson said. McDonald’s stock was down 0.5 percent at $91.03 on Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

173,MCD,"Coke, McDonald's slam NYC bid to ban big soda cups","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co and McDonald’s Corp slammed a proposed limit on soft drink sales in New York City that would turn a small McDonald’s drink into the new large and could trigger a wave of similar restrictions aimed at curbing obesity. “New Yorkers expect and deserve better than this. They can make their own choices about the beverages they purchase,” Coca-Cola said in a statement on Thursday. Coke dominates the U.S. fountain drink market, and would likely be the most hurt. On Wednesday, Bloomberg proposed amending the city’s health code to ban the sale of soft drinks in cups larger than 16 ounces, a size equal to what McDonald’s calls small. The chain’s medium is 21 ounces, and its large is 32 ounces. Its kids’ size is 12 ounces. “This raises the specter of this going to other cities as well,” said Bernstein Research analyst Ali Dibadj. “These companies may have to start playing whack-a-mole if this gains momentum.” Heather Oldani, a spokeswoman for McDonald’s, the world’s biggest hamburger chain, said fighting obesity requires “a more collaborative and comprehensive approach”. “Public health issues cannot be effectively addressed through a narrowly focused and misguided ban,” Oldani said. She declined to say how much of McDonald’s revenue comes from soft drinks, but Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo put it at around 5 percent. The ban would apply to restaurants, mobile food carts, delicatessens and concessions at movie theaters, stadiums and arenas where sales of fountain drinks are common. It would not apply to convenience, grocery or drug stores, which mostly sell beverages in bottles and cans. The proposal, which would exclude diet and dairy-based coffee drinks, must be approved by the city’s Board of Health. “You can still be a beast. We’re not keeping you from eating fattening foods or drinking 32-ounce bottles of full-sugar drinks,” Mayor Bloomberg told the All Things Digital gathering in Rancho Palos Verdes, California on Thursday via video conference. “We are just telling you that this is detrimental to your health and making you understand that by portion size.” Bloomberg’s assault on super-sized sodas opened a new front in the battle over how local governments regulate in the name of health what people eat and drink. Public health advocates who have been fighting America’s growing obesity problem say portion control is key to weight management. “There’s very strong scientific evidence that when people are served more they eat more, or in this case drink more,” said Kelly Brownell, director of Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. Brownell applauded the proposal. “My guess is this will affect enough people in a strong enough way to create a pretty significant public health benefit,” he said. Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc did not return a call for comment. PepsiCo Inc referred questions to the New York City Beverage Association, which characterized the proposal as zealous and unlikely to work. “The city is not going to address the obesity issue by attacking soda because soda is not driving the obesity rates,” said Stefan Friedman, an association spokesman. Beverage companies have several arguments on which to base possible legal challenges, including that the ban would affect interstate commerce by impacting supplies such as soda syrup and cups, said Marc Scheineson, a former associate commissioner at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and head of the food and drug practice at the Washington, D.C. law firm Allston & Bird. That argument could be outweighed by the city’s interest in public health, he said. Other Bloomberg initiatives to improve public health, such as forbidding smoking in restaurants and requiring chain restaurants to post calorie counts, were the subject of lawsuits, but the city prevailed. Regardless of whether it mounts any legal challenges, the industry is likely to spend a lot of money fighting the proposal like it has fought ongoing efforts to tax soft drinks, said Tom Pirko of Bevmark Consulting. “This is a challenge to the basic premise of their business plan, all predicated on selling sweet drinks in the largest volumes possible,” Pirko said. “New York is a mega-market, but more importantly it is New York. It sets the pace. What happens in New York has a strong influence on the rest of the country,” he said. Coke controls 70 percent of the U.S. fountain drink market, according to Beverage Digest, followed by Pepsi with 19 percent and Dr Pepper Snapple with 11 percent. Fountain business accounts for about 24 percent of the 9.3 billion cases of soda sold a year, Beverage Digest said, in a market worth $75.7 billion. Coke has been boosting its fountain business with its new Freestyle dispenser that lets customers pick from over 100 flavor combinations. It is unclear how the Freestyle machine would work if the ban passed, since diet drinks are not constrained. “To me, it puts a really big wrench in that,” said Moody’s analyst Linda Montag. Like draught beers, fountain sodas are often more profitable for suppliers than those sold in bottles and cans because they require less packaging and often have higher markups. That means the ban could constrain profits as well as sales. “Maybe you make up for it in pricing. You can’t sell as much anymore, but you up your price a little bit so it doesn’t impact the company all that much,” Montag said. The proposal is to be submitted on June 12 to the New York City Board of Health, which will have a three-month comment period before voting on it. If approved, the ban would take effect six months later and be enforced by the city’s restaurant inspectors. Restaurant owners would have nine months after adoption of the ban before facing fines of $200 for violations, Bloomberg said.

They can make their own choices about the beverages they purchase,” Coca-Cola said in a statement on Thursday. Coke dominates the U.S. fountain drink market, and would likely be the most hurt. On Wednesday, Bloomberg proposed amending the city’s health code to ban the sale of soft drinks in cups larger than 16 ounces, a size equal to what McDonald’s calls small. The chain’s medium is 21 ounces, and its large is 32 ounces. Its kids’ size is 12 ounces. “This raises the specter of this going to other cities as well,” said Bernstein Research analyst Ali Dibadj. “These companies may have to start playing whack-a-mole if this gains momentum.” Heather Oldani, a spokeswoman for McDonald’s, the world’s biggest hamburger chain, said fighting obesity requires “a more collaborative and comprehensive approach”. “Public health issues cannot be effectively addressed through a narrowly focused and misguided ban,” Oldani said.   She declined to say how much of McDonald’s revenue comes from soft drinks, but Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo put it at around 5 percent. The ban would apply to restaurants, mobile food carts, delicatessens and concessions at movie theaters, stadiums and arenas where sales of fountain drinks are common. It would not apply to convenience, grocery or drug stores, which mostly sell beverages in bottles and cans. The proposal, which would exclude diet and dairy-based coffee drinks, must be approved by the city’s Board of Health. “You can still be a beast. We’re not keeping you from eating fattening foods or drinking 32-ounce bottles of full-sugar drinks,” Mayor Bloomberg told the All Things D i gital gathering in Rancho Palos Verdes, California on Thursday via video conference. “We are just telling you that this is detrimental to your health and making you understand that by portion size.” Bloomberg’s assault on super-sized sodas opened a new front in the battle over how local governments regulate in the name of health what people eat and drink. Public health advocates who have been fighting America’s growing obesity problem say portion control is key to weight management. “There’s very strong scientific evidence that when people are served more they eat more, or in this case drink more,” said Kelly Brownell, director of Yale University’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity. Brownell applauded the proposal. “My guess is this will affect enough people in a strong enough way to create a pretty significant public health benefit,” he said. Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc did not return a call for comment. PepsiCo Inc referred questions to the New York City Beverage Association, which characterized the proposal as zealous and unlikely to work. “The city is not going to address the obesity issue by attacking soda because soda is not driving the obesity rates,” said Stefan Friedman, an association spokesman. Beverage companies have several arguments on which to base possible legal challenges, including that the ban would affect interstate commerce by impacting supplies such as soda syrup and cups, said Marc Scheineson, a former associate commissioner at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and head of the food and drug practice at the Washington, D.C. law firm Alsto n & Bir d. That argument could be outweighed by the city’s interest in public health, he said. Other Bloomberg initiatives to improve public health, such as forbidding smoking in restaurants and requiring chain restaurants to post calorie counts, were the subject of lawsuits, but the city prevailed. Regardless of whether it mounts any legal challenges, the industry is likely to spend a lot of money fighting the proposal like it has fought ongoing efforts to tax soft drinks, said Tom Pirko of Bevmark Consulting. “This is a challenge to the basic premise of their business plan, all predicated on selling sweet drinks in the largest volumes possible,” Pirko said. “New York is a mega-market, but more importantly it is New York. It sets the pace. What happens in New York has a strong influence on the rest of the country,” he said.

178,MCD,McDonald's May sales miss Street view as economy weighs,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) reported a lower-than-expected rise in global sales at established restaurants in May and warned that austerity measures in Europe and global economic volatility were taking a bite out of results. May sales landed below Wall Street’s estimates in Europe and the United States — its two largest markets — and unexpectedly fell in Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, due to declines in Japan and China, the company said on Friday. The world’s biggest hamburger chain has been more resilient to economic gyrations than most of its competitors. But analysts said it faced a perfect storm of challenges during May, when European debt worries roared back to life, rival restaurants stepped up promotions and growth cooled in China. “This month’s results point to a slower pace of growth ahead for the company after a multi-year period of exceeding expectations,” Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said. Foreign currency rates and higher costs, due in part to preparations for the summer Olympics in London, also are expected to weigh on earnings this quarter, McDonald’s said. The report sent McDonald’s shares as low as $85.92 before easing to $87.86, off 0.6 percent, in midday trading. The reaction spilled over to Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N), which dropped 4 percent to $64.08 and was one of the top decliners on the New York Stock Exchange. Yum’s KFC chain is the biggest western restaurant brand in China. Sales at McDonald’s restaurants open at least 13 months increased 3.3 percent globally. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a rise of 4.6 percent, while analysts queried by Consensus Metrix expected a 5.2 percent gain. For Europe, which edges out the United States as the company’s top revenue producer, same-store sales rose 2.9 percent, below expectations of at least 4.4 percent. Sales fell in Germany, which has been more sensitive than many other markets to economic shocks, but remained positive in France and other important regional markets. McDonald’s has been a top performer in Europe despite many months of worry over the financial crisis and related belt tightening. The softer results suggest “that the economic climate must be getting worse,” Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said. Europe was also a disappointment in April, when McDonald’s same-store sales rose 3.3 percent, and the trend stoked concerns that European consumer spending was weakening. U.S. same-restaurant sales rose 4.4 percent last month, just below Wall Street’s most conservative projection of 4.7 percent. In the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit, same-restaurant sales fell 1.7 percent, while analysts expected a jump of at least 3.2 percent. Japan is McDonald’s largest market in Asia, but China often steals headlines because the company is building a lot of restaurants there. The Golden Arches chain said unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates would lower second-quarter profit by 7 cents to 9 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected McDonald’s to earn $1.41 per share this quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The second quarter is going to be tough for them. You just hope the back half can get a little better,” Russo said.

181,MCD,"New York City official defends ""supersize"" drink ban","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New York City’s top health official shot back on Thursday at critics who have blasted the city’s plan to limit the sale of oversized sugary drinks such as soda, calling beverage industry opposition ridiculous. The proposed ban, which caps most sugar-sweetened beverages at 16 ounces (half a liter) and carries a $200 fine for vendors that do not comply, met immediate backlash from beverage companies and others who argue it is government overreach, but was lauded by public health experts. “It’s not saying ‘no’ to people. It’s saying, ‘Are you sure? Do you really want that?’” Thomas Farley, New York City’s health commissioner, said. “It’s sending people a message while giving people the freedom to drink as much as they want.” Speaking at a conference in Washington aimed at reducing the consumption of sugary beverages, Farley said drink makers were following the same playbook as tobacco companies that push back against government action aimed at protecting consumers from harmful products. Coca-Cola Co and McDonald’s Corp along with beverage industry groups have said consumers should be able to make their own drink choices and that sodas are not to blame for the nation’s soaring obesity rates. The industry has launched a wave of ads in response to New York’s plan, which Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced last week. Farley said sugary drink consumption may just be part of the U.S. obesity epidemic but that such products were the largest single source of sugar in the diet and had a major impact on health. Reducing obesity by just 10 percent in New York City would save about 500 lives a year, he added. “It’s ridiculous to say we shouldn’t try something that’s only going to solve a portion of the problem,” he said at the event, which was sponsored by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a group that has long advocated against junk food. American Beverage Association spokeswoman Karen Hanretty, in a statement, defended the industry’s response and said there was little support for Bloomberg’s proposal. Many people think the plan “has gone too far with a proposal that will do nothing to reduce the serious problem of obesity in America,” she said. The city’s cup-size ban will be submitted on Tuesday to the New York City Board of Health, which will vote on it after a three-month comment period. If approved by the board, the ban would take effect early next year. The beverage industry is expected to spend large amounts of money to fight it. Legal analysts have said drink makers face an uphill battle in the courts if they pursue legal challenges to block the effort. “There are so many examples where states impose standards on consumer products sold within their borders,” Michelle Mello, a Harvard University professor of law and public health, said on Monday. “It seems hard to believe that this would be singled out as unreasonable by a court.” Public health experts have embraced Bloomberg’s plan and see it as an approach that could be applied in communities across the country. Farley and other health advocates at the conference said they were confident that people over time would embrace smaller cup sizes as the right thing to do just as they eventually came around to bans on smoking in public places. “If we can do that for .... tobacco, we can certainly do that for obesity as well,” Farley said. Kelly Brownell, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, said targeting sugar-sweetened beverages made sense because they offered empty calories with no nutritional value. Another U.S. mayor, Michael Nutter of Philadelphia, told the conference he had seen some progress from drink makers selling smaller sizes and low-calorie or no-calorie products, but they were not owning up so far to their role in the nation’s weight struggle. “The industry needs to at least acknowledge that they are part of the problem,” he said.

184,MCD,Olympics-IOC chief backs Games food and drinks sponsors,"BERLIN, July 10 (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee issued public backing of its Games sponsors Coca-Cola and McDonald’s on Tuesday, a day after President Jacques Rogge was quoted as saying there was a “question mark” over their sponsorship due to obesity concerns. “I would like to clarify comments attributed to me in several media reports regarding Coca-Cola’s and McDonald’s Olympic sponsorship,” said Rogge in a statement mailed to Reuters. “The IOC hugely values the long-term sponsorship and support of both McDonald’s and Coca-Cola. Through the years we have personally witnessed the positive impact that they make as TOP sponsors,” said the IOC president. On Monday Rogge had been quoted in several British media as saying there had been a “question mark” over the sponsorship of the Olympics by McDonald’s and Coca-Cola, driven by global obesity concerns. His comments come less than three weeks before the start of the London Olympics on July 27. “For those companies, we’ve said to them: ‘Listen, there is an issue in terms of the growing trend on obesity, what are you going to do about that?’” he was quoted by several media on Monday as saying. The IOC has regularly had to answer questions regarding the sponsor agreements with the two food and beverage companies for the world’s biggest mutli-sports event and whether their association with the Olympics, promoting a healthy lifestyle, was compatible. On Tuesday Rogge said the IOC was proud to be associated with them. “Both companies bring forward the spirit of the Olympic Games through creative and engaging global programs that promote physical activity and the values that the Olympic Games are all about.” “We are proud to work with both Coca-Cola and McDonald’s, with whom we have long term agreements in place through 2020.” McDonald’s, whose four restaurants in London’s Olympic Park include its biggest in the world, extended its 36-year backing of the Games in January by signing up as sponsor for another eight years.

British lobby group 38 Degrees has gathered almost 165,000 signatures for an online petition under the banner “Stop Olympic Tax Dodging” urging sponsors to turn down the tax breaks. It claimed victory on Wednesday, posting “Two down!” after both companies confirmed they would not be using the exemption. However, both companies said they had not planned to use the exemption, a condition of London’s bid to host the Games, and denied that they had been influenced by the campaign. “Coca-Cola has never intended to, and will not be making, any corporate or income tax exemption claim with respect to any activity concerning our involvement with the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games,” the soft drinks company said. McDonald’s also said its decision was made some time ago and pre-dated the protest. The fast food chain said its revenue from the Games would be less than 0.1 percent of its annual UK sales. The company will be setting up four temporary restaurants at the Olympic Park during the Olympics which start on July 27. Coca-Cola and McDonald’s are two of 11 international companies who pay almost $1 billion to sponsor Winter and Summer Olympics over a four-year cycle. International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge has praised the two companies after he was initially quoted as saying there was a “question mark” over their sponsorship due to obesity concerns. Foreign athletes competing in the Games are also exempt from  British income tax. Sports stars who come to Britain for other tournaments are normally liable to pay tax on their earnings and a proportion of their worldwide endorsement income.",7182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/oly-tax-mcdonalds-adv09/olympics-coke-mcdonalds-waive-uk-tax-exemption-idUSL6E8IIHHD20120718

Shares fell 3 percent to $88.81 after the world’s largest fast-food chain operator said higher costs and the drag from the U.S. dollar conspired with softening consumer demand to hurt business. The McDonald’s results came days after Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc surprised investors by saying the sluggish U.S. economy had cooled same-restaurant sales growth, adding to concerns about how much consumers were cutting back on discretionary spending. “We knew it was going to be a tough quarter going in, and it certainly was,” Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said. “This year is going to be a challenge for the chain. Europe (its biggest market for sales) has slowed down, and the consumer remains pretty frugal,” Russo said. “What we don’t know is were they more aggressive in terms of discounting to get customers,” he said. McDonald’s net income fell to $1.35 billion, or $1.32 per share, during the second quarter, from $1.41 billion, or $1.35 per share, a year earlier. The impact of the stronger dollar — which lessens the value of sales overseas for U.S. companies — cut 7 cents a share from earnings in the latest quarter, the company said. Analysts, on average, looked for $1.37 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales edged up to $6.92 billion from $6.91 billion a year earlier. Sales at restaurants open at least 13 months were up 3.7 percent in the quarter, exceeding the 2.9 percent increase expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix, but down from a 5.6 percent increase in June. Comparable sales growth slowed even more in June — to 4.4 from a 7.7 percent rise a year ago. “You are starting to see signs that consumers are spending less at restaurants,” said Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy. “You are also seeing increased competition.” The company said it expects same-restaurant sales to rise in July, but less than they did in the second quarter. Same-restaurant sales rose 3.6 percent in the United States and 3.8 percent in Europe in the quarter. Analysts expected gains of 3.5 percent in the U.S. and 2.4 percent for Europe. Comparable sales rose 0.9 percent in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, hurt by weakness in Japan. Analysts expected a 0.8 percent increase in that region.

195,MCD,"McDonald's July same-store sales flat, worst in 9 years","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) reported flat sales in July at established restaurants around the world, its worst performance in more than nine years and a signal that a weakening global economy is taking a bite out of mainstream diners’ discretionary spending. The results came in far below Wall Street’s expectation and marked the first time since April 2003 that sales at restaurants open at least 13 months did not rise. Shares of the world’s biggest hamburger chain were down 1.6 percent at $87.56 in midday trading. The stock has fallen more than 14 percent from its peak of $102.22 in January. “We’ve grown used to seeing McDonald’s weather bad economies, so this is a bit of a surprise,” RBC Capital analyst Larry Miller said. Just two weeks ago, McDonald’s said it had expected worldwide July sales at restaurants open at least 13 months to rise, but not as much as the 3.7 percent gain reported in the second quarter. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix expected a gain of 2.3 percent and the flat result suggested that sales slowed in the days after McDonald’s issued same-restaurant sales guidance on July 23. “It’s clear that the consumer is starting to cut back a little,” Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said. After months of outpacing rivals, it appeared that McDonald’s ceded a bit of market share in July. Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N is among the fast-food chains that have stepped up their game with new food and promotions. It has been blitzing diners with sexy ads starring the likes of soccer star David Beckham and silver screen siren Salma Hayek. “Its competitors have more news and they’re promoting more aggressively. There’s no question that their competitors are getting better,” Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said. McDonald’s advertising sometimes missed the mark last month, when calendar shifts weighed on results. July sales in the United States and Europe were down 0.1 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively. Analysts, on average, expected a 2.2 percent gain in the United States and a rise of 2.4 percent in Europe. Europe just edges out the United States as McDonald’s top market for sales. Results in France and Germany - two top European markets for McDonald’s - were weak amid ongoing belt-tightening and the company called out concerns about “several Southern European markets amidst an increasingly difficult environment.” U.S. promotions were not enough to “offset the effects of the sluggish economy,” the company said. Domestic sales of new chicken McBites slowed more than expected after McDonald’s stopped pitching the item. The company also was up against a strong result from last July, when its extremely successful mango pineapple smoothie bolstered sales. Same-restaurant sales from the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region were down 1.5 percent, while analysts expected a 1.4 percent gain. Ongoing weakness in Japan, major flooding in China and a shift in the timing of Ramadan were among the factors weighing on sales in that region. McDonald’s has high hurdles ahead, Russo said, noting that it will need to post same-restaurant sales growth on top of gains last year, when many of its rivals were suffering same-restaurant sales losses. McDonald’s July results did not shake the confidence that portfolio manager Harvey Neiman has in the company, which is a holding in his Neiman Large Cap Value Fund (NEIMX.O). “Their foot is still to the pedal,” Neiman said. “If we see a six-month trend like this, then we’ll wonder what’s going on at the helm. We’re not on the alert yet.” ",8082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-sales-july/mcdonalds-july-same-store-sales-flat-worst-in-9-years-idUSBRE8771AT20120808

199,MCD,PayPal could heat up mobile payments race if McDonald's test pays off,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - PayPal is in the early stages of what may be a blockbuster mobile payments deal with McDonald’s Corp, the world’s biggest hamburger chain. McDonald’s is testing a mobile payments service featuring PayPal at 30 of its restaurants in France. Earlier this year, McDonald’s ran demonstrations of a broader PayPal mobile payments service at its franchisee conference in Orlando, Florida. A McDonald’s spokeswoman confirmed the France tests and said the PayPal demonstration at its conference was part of a booth that features “technology coming within the next 24 months or so.” PayPal is racing against start-up Square Inc and other technology companies to become the mobile payments service of choice as consumers increasingly use smart phones to make purchases in shops, restaurants and other retail locations. Square struck what could be its most important partnership to date last week when it teamed up with Starbucks Corp, the world’s largest coffee chain. PayPal, owned by eBay Inc, has signed up more than 15 retailers, including Home Depot and Office Depot, to accept PayPal payments in their stores. But landing a partner the size of McDonald’s, with over 30,000 restaurants, would be a big win, according to analysts. “McDonald’s would certainly be a whale,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “If McDonald’s customers can stand in line and order on a mobile app and pay with PayPal that is a huge extension of PayPal’s reach.” Square’s deal with Starbucks “creates a sense of urgency for PayPal,” he added. “This is a race.” The test in France lets McDonald’s customers order food on smart phones through a McDonald’s mobile application, or online, and pay with PayPal. There is a separate line in the test locations to pick up the meals, according to a PayPal spokesman. Demonstrations at the McDonald’s franchisee conference in Orlando featured a more “in-depth” service that would allow customers to order and pay using PayPal’s digital wallet and mobile application, the spokesman said. Rolling out a service like this may help McDonald’s cut lines at restaurants, which is a key factor in maintaining and growing same-store sales, Luria said. “If they can shave 10 seconds off wait times, same-store sales could go up a lot,” he added. “It’s substantial.” ",8172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-paypal-mcdonalds/paypal-could-heat-up-mobile-payments-race-if-mcdonalds-test-pays-off-idUSBRE87G0ZB20120817

202,MCD,"Advocates say McDonald's, Nickelodeon violate kids' privacy","* Groups file complaints with FTC, allege COPPA violations * Say “refer-a-friend” campaigns unfair, deceptive * Call on FTC to investigate and stop such viral marketing By Jasmin Melvin WASHINGTON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Consumer advocates accused companies including McDonald’s Corp and Viacom Inc’s  Nickelodeon of unlawfully using children to market their websites through campaigns that encourage sharing video, games and other content. The Center for Digital Democracy and 16 other groups asked the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to investigate, accusing the companies of violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by asking children to divulge personal information and the information of friends without parental consent. Angela Campbell, a Georgetown law professor and legal counsel for the Center for Digital Democracy, said the FTC should stop such “commercial exploitation of children.” The FTC implemented the children’s privacy law in 2000 through its Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule, which gives parents a say over what information websites can collect about children under age 13. Lawmakers and privacy advocates have long argued that companies are not doing enough to safeguard customers’ privacy. The advocacy groups filed five separate complaints with the FTC against McDonald’s HappyMeal.com, Viacom’s Nick.com, Doctor’s Associates Inc’s SubwayKids.com, Turner Broadcasting System’s CartoonNetwork.com and General Mills Inc’s  ReesesPuffs.com and TrixWorld.com. Turner Broadcasting is a unit of Time Warner. “We take our compliance with children’s privacy rules very seriously, and the allegations made by these groups are absolutely incorrect,” Nickelodeon spokesman David Bittler said. General Mills spokesman Tom Forsythe said the complaints seem to have mischaracterized their practices. “COPPA permits ‘send to a friend’ emails, provided the sending friend’s email address or full name is never collected and the recipient’s email address is deleted following the sending of the message,” he said. But the advocacy groups argue that the refer-a-friend campaigns are unfair and deceptive to children who may not be aware that they are generating advertising messages. “The companies identified in these complaints are clearly trying to circumvent privacy safeguards for children,” said American University communications professor Kathryn Montgomery. “They are also enlisting kids and their friends in deceptive marketing schemes disguised as play — in some cases for junk foods and other unhealthy products — completely under the radar of parents,” said Montgomery, one of the leaders of the campaign to have COPPA enacted in 1998. The FTC and White House unveiled earlier this year privacy frameworks that would give all Internet users, not just those under 13, greater control over how their personal data is collected, shared and used by advertisers and tech companies. Some lawmakers have also called COPPA woefully out of touch with technology developments, leaving kids vulnerable. Bipartisan legislation has been introduced to create a “Do Not Track” system to protect kids, but it has been stalled in Congress. The FTC earlier this month proposed further changes to its planned update of COPPA regulations that would ensure that websites and third-party data brokers get parental permission before they collect children’s data. The advocacy groups’ complaints included the “star in a music video” feature on the McDonald’s site. A child is able to upload their photo to create a video with their image on a cartoon character, and is asked to share the video by providing the names and email addresses of friends. Those friends then receive an email asking them to check out the site and saying they were “tagged for fun by a friend.” All of this occurs without having to get a parent involved. “McDonald’s makes every effort to be in compliance with all government regulations,” McDonald’s USA spokeswoman Danya Proud said. A Cartoon Network spokesman said they would review any allegations closely, and stressed that the network takes complying with COPPA very seriously. A Subway Restaurants spokesperson said they also took online privacy seriously and were COPPA-compliant. The advocacy groups also asked the FTC to update COPPA to bar cookies from being placed on computers that visit children’s websites without parental consent, and to include photographs in its definition of personal information. Both items have already been proposed by the FTC. The FTC said it has received the complaints and will be reviewing them carefully.",8222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-privacy-kids/advocates-say-mcdonalds-nickelodeon-violate-kids-privacy-idUSL2E8JM5HK20120822

205,MCD,NY state senator loses election after backing gay marriage,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Republican state senator whose vote was crucial to legalizing gay marriage in New York has lost his primary election while a Senate colleague who also broke with the party’s stance against same-sex unions narrowly escaped defeat. Senators Roy McDonald and Stephen Saland were among four New York Senate Republicans to cast key votes last year to make New York the most populous U.S. state to allow homosexual marriages. After a count of absentee ballots, McDonald was determined to have lost his race while Saland narrowly won in September 13 primary elections. Mark Grisanti, another Republican senator who backed the gay marriage measure, which passed New York’s Republican-controlled Senate on a 33-29 vote in June 2011, won his primary race by a clear margin. A fourth senator who supported the bill was not seeking re-election. McDonald lost the Republican nomination in the 43rd District to Kathy Marchione, the Saratoga County clerk, in a contest that frequently touched on the issue of gay marriage. Although the results are yet to be certified, Marchione had a lead of about 110 votes after a final count of absentee ballots, according to her campaign and The Saratogian newspaper. About 50 votes still were awaiting adjudication by a judge. “Senator McDonald’s vote on marriage was certainly on the minds of voters but they took even greater issue with the fact that he was telling people he would vote a certain way up to a week prior and then voted differently,” said Ken Girardin, a spokesman for the Marchione campaign. A McDonald spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. Saland of Poughkeepsie and Grisanti of Buffalo have retained their party’s support following the primaries. Saland’s victory was not secured until Monday after a final tally of absentee ballots gave him a lead of a little more than 100 votes. The New York primary races were being closely watched as a measure of the tolerance Republican voters might have for candidates who deviate from the official party line, which defines marriage as being between “one man and one woman.” Lawmakers in Rhode Island, Delaware and elsewhere are expected to weigh gay marriage legislation next year and some Republican backing could be needed to pass those measures. And this November, voters in four states - Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington - will decide ballot initiatives on the issue. Same-sex marriage has been legalized in seven states and the District of Columbia. But the outcomes of the New York primaries were close enough that both opponents and supporters of same-sex marriage were able to find encouragement in the results on Tuesday. Jason McGuire, the executive director of New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms, an evangelical Christian organization that lobbies against same-sex marriage, said Marchione’s victory and even Saland’s narrow win should be seen as a warning to Republican legislators tempted to “go rogue,” as he put it. “The fact that she came from behind with so little support shows that no amount of activist dollars can protect you from an angry electorate,” he said of Marchione’s victory. But Lynn Faria, the interim executive director of Empire State Pride Agenda, which has lobbied in support of same-sex marriage, said Marchione’s narrow win showed many Republicans are willing to back candidates who support gay unions. “Now that we finally know the unofficial results of our state’s primary elections, even some among the most conservative of New York voters have sent a clear message that they will support elected officials who stood on the right side of history in June 2011,” she said in a statement.

McDonald, who has been at the helm since July 2009, is refocusing on core categories, countries and innovations with both the $10 billion restructuring and a strategy laid out in June that homes in on the company’s 40 biggest businesses, 20 biggest new products and 10 key developing markets. Ackman, who disclosed his stake in the maker of Tide detergent and Crest toothpaste too late to have any proposals on the agenda, was not in attendance, and only one shareholder referred to him, asking why it took the investment of an activist to boost P&G;’s stock. “If we remain focused on the plan I talked about, the 40/20/10 plan, with improved innovation from discontinuous innovation, with productivity improvement, then we are all convinced that shareholders will get an increase in value and the stock will reflect that,” McDonald replied, without mentioning Ackman directly. “We are focused like a laser, we are holding our own feet to the fire to do this.” Though Ackman was absent, several of his analysts - who are far less recognizable than the 6-foot, 3-inch hedge fund manager with the shock of gray hair - were in the crowd listening closely. Since Ackman became involved in the stock, P&G;’s board has expressed confidence in the plans laid out by chairman, president and CEO McDonald. The board has publicly backed McDonald, giving the former Army captain time to overhaul the 175-year old company, which is struggling keep up with competitors. Shares of P&G; have risen since Ackman's stake was disclosed but have trailed the gains in the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, of which they are a component, so far this year. All 11 board members, including McDonald, were elected for another year at the meeting. A shareholder proposal on adopting a simple majority vote to pass all such proposals passed, while two other shareholder proposals were defeated. P&G; shares were down 0.6 percent at $68.69 on Tuesday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up 9.3 percent since Ackman’s stake was disclosed in July. PRE-ACKMAN PRESSURE McDonald was under pressure even before news of Ackman’s stake surfaced, after lackluster earnings and the February announcement of the $10 billion restructuring plan that analysts deemed insufficiently transformative. “In our view, management cannot afford to fall short of its promises again, as the clock is ticking on its turnaround,” Morningstar analyst Erin Lash said earlier this month. “It is possible that P&G; could be forced to consider breaking up this household and personal-care behemoth.” Pershing Square is P&G;’s 10th-largest shareholder, with 21.92 million shares, or 0.79 percent of the company’s outstanding shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. Only a week ago in New York, Ackman exerted public pressure on P&G; by answering a few questions about his plans for the company. Ackman met with P&G;’s board in September at the Manhattan office of Kenneth Chenault, the CEO of American Express Co (AXP.N) and a P&G; board member. At that meeting, Ackman did not mince words about what he considered McDonald’s lackluster performance and the aspects that need repair if company performance is to improve. For now, Ackman has left his suggestions with the board. Ackman has been instrumental in shaking up management at Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) and retailer J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N). P&G; stumbled in recent months as competitors failed to match some of the price increases it imposed on goods including laundry and dish detergents to mitigate higher commodity costs. The strengthening dollar has also trimmed the value of sales in overseas markets. “The announced restructuring is a direct result of persistent questions about P&G;’s ability to grow profitably,” said Lash. Still, several of the attendees at Tuesday’s event said they stand behind the company and its leader. “They are going in the right direction,” said Bill Harding, an 86-year-old shareholder who lives in Kettering, Ohio, after growing up in Cincinnati. Harding and his wife, Pat, said that they reinvest their dividends in P&G; and still think it is one of the best companies in the country, if not the world.

A second Prada store will replace McDonald’s in the 19th-century marble-floored shopping mall as a result of a public tender whose terms McDonald’s called “unfair.” To celebrate the last days of one of its busiest restaurants in Italy, McDonald’s offered free burgers, fries and drinks to over 5,000 people from noon to 4:00 p.m. on Tuesday. “We wanted to say goodbye to the Galleria with a smile,” said Paolo Mereghetti, head of communication at McDonald’s in Italy.

213,MCD,"McDonald's sales growth cools, chilled by competition","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) posted its worst quarterly restaurant sales growth performance in nine years on Friday, lifting the curtain on the fast-food industry’s ruthless fight for customers in a weak economy. The world’s biggest fast-food chain is battling more than the bleak global economy that is curbing appetites for purchases of its hamburgers, salads and smoothies. Resurgent chains like Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N and Yum Brand Inc’s (YUM.N) Taco Bell now are challenging McDonald’s in the United States with revamped menus, celebrity endorsers and a renewed focus on low-priced food. McDonald’s domestic market falls just behind Europe as the company’s top region for sales. Easing food cost inflation has allowed U.S. restaurants to step up their menu price wars. “It’s led to a very cutthroat restaurant environment,” Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy said. “You have a scenario where the overall pie is shrinking, and companies are competing aggressively to take their piece of it,” Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said. When asked to explain why the third quarter’s results lagged even those put up during the height of the financial crisis, McDonald’s Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson attributed the results to the tougher battle for stomachs and economic challenges in each of the company’s major regions. That confluence of factors forced McDonald’s to miss Wall Street’s earnings estimates for the second quarter in a row. It also warned that sales at established restaurants - a closely watched gauge of restaurant performance - are down so far this month. “When the economic crisis began in 2008, few people thought the environment would still be as uncertain and fragile as it is today,” Thompson said. “It is clear, however, that this operating environment is the new normal,” said the CEO, who added that the company’s marketshare is flat or up in all major markets. McDonald’s is not alone in its woes. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) on Thursday forecast a slowdown in same-restaurant sales growth for 2013. The popular burrito chain also said it wasn’t losing customers to competitors like Taco Bell, but investors saw its guidance as a signal that Chipotle’s days of torrid growth may be over. The setbacks reported by the two top industry performers sent sector shares lower on Friday. McDonald’s stock fell 4.5 percent to close at $88.72, Chipotle tumbled 15 percent to $243 and Yum slipped 2.8 percent to $70.09. McDonald’s and Chipotle get significant business from the United States, while China is Yum’s primary market. Third-quarter net income at McDonald’s fell 3.5 percent to $1.46 billion, or $1.43 per share, from $1.51 billion, or $1.45 per share, a year earlier. It missed analysts’ average estimate by 4 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total sales slipped 0.2 percent to $7.15 billion. The impact of a stronger dollar, which decreases the value of sales overseas for U.S. companies, trimmed earnings by 8 cents per share. McDonald’s global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 1.9 percent, the first gain of less than 2 percent since the second quarter of 2003. That result just missed the 2 percent increase that analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected because of shortfalls in the United States and the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region. Expectations were muted for Europe, where government belt-tightening has hurt demand. Still, results topped estimates after the company’s emphasis on value-priced meals like the McDeal extra value meal helped offset a drop in traffic. Analysts said McDonald’s will use its size and business acumen to keep its edge over rivals. “This chain will just have to grind through this. We’re confident they can do this with their brand power and their advertising budget,” Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said. Analysts expect other restaurant operators to lower expectations for this quarter and the next. They say same-restaurant sales gains will be hard to come by because results from last year got a bump from unseasonably warm weather that freed up cash that otherwise would have gone to pay heating bills. It also will be difficult to offset food costs with menu price increases because traffic is already weak. “It’s not getting easier out there,” Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matthew DiFrisco said.

219,MCD,Procter & Gamble's forecast critical to CEO's tenure,"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) Chief Executive Bob McDonald’s efforts to fend off activist investor William Ackman are not likely to be helped by the company’s quarterly results this week. The maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors is expected to post its third consecutive decline in revenue and earnings per share when it issues fiscal first-quarter results on October 25. Analysts trimmed their targets when P&G; gave a forecast in August that was below Wall Street’s view. Investors will also be watching for a forecast for the current fiscal second quarter and, less likely, any changes to the full-year forecast for signs that McDonald’s plans for turning the company around are starting to take hold. “If he comes in weak would anybody be surprised that the Bill Ackmans of the world have more power?” said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Cincinnati-based Bahl & Gaynor, which manages $7.3 billion, including 4.89 million P&G; shares. P&G; disappointed investors by cutting its fiscal guidance multiple times during fiscal 2012. Analysts have said that McDonald, who has run P&G; since July 2009, may be running out of time to show that his strategy is working. Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management is P&G;’s 10th-largest shareholder, has publicly blamed P&G;’s top brass for high costs and declining revenue while saying that he understands the board wants to give McDonald time to repair years of damage. Ackman met with board members in early September at a meeting in New York, where he laid out his complaints. “I attribute a lot of those problems to senior management,” Ackman said on October 1, adding that it will pay off to wait for “this CEO or the next CEO” to shape up the company. P&G;, which McDonald has admitted lost its footing as its stream of innovation slowed down, is now focused on its 40 biggest businesses, 20 biggest new products and 10 key developing markets. A $10 billion restructuring has led to thousands of job cuts, some even earlier than planned, though some analysts believe P&G; could reduce costs even further. But given the recent history of having to lower its forecasts, setting an overly optimistic one now could just set a trap for later. “They need to set something low so they can hopefully beat it or at least not miss it,” said Caris & Co analyst Linda Bolton Weiser. “They can’t miss guidance, they can’t.” While Ackman could press harder for change at the top, investors at P&G;’s October 9 annual meeting largely backed the CEO. “I’m really proud of you, Mr. McDonald,” investor James Sakelos said during the meeting, held blocks away from P&G;’s headquarters in Cincinnati. “You are doing an excellent job and we do have to be patient.” McDonald, in an unscripted moment during the highly orchestrated event, even got a joke in about P&G;’s share price, which rose after Ackman bought in during the summer. “I have a little stock in P&G;, which I’m thankful (for),” Sakelos said. “Please buy more,” McDonald replied, getting laughs from the crowd. “There was a degree of conviction there that is something that you normally don’t see from Procter people,” said Bahl & Gaynor’s McCormick, who attended the meeting. “The bottom line is a lot of investors are going to be intensely interested in these upcoming results,” he said. “If they are to the upside and exceed expectations people are going to give McDonald the benefit of the doubt for at least another quarter.” Even as P&G;’s 10th-largest shareholder, Ackman’s stake is small. Pershing Square holds 21.92 million shares, or 0.79 percent of the company’s outstanding shares, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts on average expect P&G; to post sales of $20.77 billion and earnings of 96 cents per share for the fiscal first quarter that ended in September, down from sales of $21.92 billion and earnings of $1.03 per share a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In August, P&G; forecast a profit of 91 cents to 97 cents per share, while analysts at that time had expected a profit of $1.03 per share. Shares of P&G; have risen since Ackman's stake was disclosed in July but have trailed the gains in the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, of which they are a component, so far this year.

220,MCD,McDonald's to sell ground coffee in Canada,"TORONTO (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp will start selling ground coffee in major Canadian stores in November, in a new challenge to rivals like Starbucks Corp and Dunkin Donuts. The coffee, priced at C$6.99 for 340 grams, launches as McDonald’s steps up its expansion in Canada, after holding back for more than five years. The fast food chain’s Canadian President John Betts credits the coffee business for a turnaround at his unit, and now sees the potential for a much larger footprint across the country. “This year, we’re going to build more restaurants than we’ve built in the last seven or eight years,” he said in an interview on Thursday. “Next year, it’s going to ramp up from that.” Around 30 new stores will open by the end of 2012, Betts said. He did not give specific figures for future periods. McDonald’s has about 1,400 outlets in Canada. Betts’ upbeat message stands out against last week’s earnings release, when McDonald’s reported its worst quarterly restaurant sales growth in nine years thanks to tough competition in the United States. Betts said the chain built too many stores too quickly in Canada. But in the last three years, he says, its coffee business has made all the difference. Coffee is not an obvious point of entry in Canada, where Starbucks Corp is ubiquitous and doughnut and coffee chain Tim Hortons Inc borders on a national symbol. Between McDonald’s coffee push and Tim Hortons’ expanding lunch menu, the two chains are increasingly going head to head. Over the long term, Betts said, McDonald’s may also look at the expanding market for single-cup coffee brewing. The company does not currently sell K-cups, used in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc’s Keurig machines, or similar products for competing systems. “Down the road, as our coffee journey and beverage journey evolves, we’ll look at other things, certainly grocery, and K-cups and all those kind of things,” said Betts. Tim Hortons recently entered the single-serve coffee market, joining Starbucks, Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc and many others.

222,MCD,McDonald's has no plans for U.S. sales of packaged coffee,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), which next month will start selling packaged coffee in some of its restaurants in Canada, has no current plans to sell bagged coffee in the United States, a spokeswoman said on Friday. News of the company’s plans to sell the McCafe-branded coffee in Canada came shortly after market watchers noticed that McDonald’s had filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to use its McCafe brand for “ground and whole bean coffee. That trademark filing launched speculation that the world’s biggest fast-food chain might offer bagged coffee in the United States.

News of the company’s plans to sell the McCafe-branded coffee in Canada came shortly after market watchers noticed that McDonald’s had filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to use its McCafe brand for “ground and whole bean coffee.” That trademark filing launched speculation that the world’s biggest fast-food chain might offer bagged coffee in the United States.

224,MCD,UPDATE 3-Burger King bounces back as McDonald's flags,"* Overall same-restaurant sales rose 1.4 percent * Pace of October same-restaurant sales accelerated * Company cites increased focus on value-priced meals * 4-cent dividend initiated Oct 29 (Reuters) - Burger King Worldwide Inc turned in stronger-than-expected U.S. and Canadian restaurant sales for the latest quarter - when rival McDonald’s Corp posted its worst quarterly restaurant sales growth in nine years. Burger King executives declined to say whether additional business is coming from McDonald’s, whose U.S. dominance has softened amid tougher competition from resurgent chains like Burger King and Yum Brands Inc’s Taco Bell. “We’re keeping the sales and the share that we believe we gained earlier this year,” Chief Financial Officer Daniel Schwartz said in an interview with Reuters. The pace of the company’s sales at established restaurants  has accelerated so far in October, Schwartz said. Burger King, known for its “Whopper” hamburgers, attributed the gains to its increased focus on value-priced foods that lure in more customers. Executives also said sales of higher-priced limited-time food specials, such as this summer’s BBQ menu, are helping. Miami-based Burger King has further boosted its business with wrap sandwiches, soft-serve ice cream, salads, fruit smoothies and other new menu items that have attracted women and people over the age of 55. Burger King historically has appealed largely to young males. Its menu changes mirror many of those made at McDonald’s, which traditionally has boasted a broader range of customers. The company, the third-largest U.S. hamburger chain after  McDonald’s and Wendy’s Co, said third-quarter net income fell to $6.6 million, or 2 cents per share, from $38.8 million, or 11 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding the impact of restaurant sales to franchisees and foreign exchange, Burger King earned 17 cents per share - beating the 15 cents per share expected on average by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. System-wide comparable sales, or sales at company-owned and franchise restaurants open at least 13 months, rose 1.4 percent. Three analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had estimated a 1.56 percent gain in same-restaurant sales. Quarterly comparable sales in the United States and Canada rose 1.6 percent - slightly better than analysts’ expected - driven by Burger King’s summer BBQ and chicken dishes. Revenue fell about 26 percent to $451.1 million due to refranchising deals and a stronger dollar, Burger King said. The company, which went public in June, also initiated a quarterly cash dividend of 4 cents per share. Burger King’s return to the stock market came less than two years after it was taken private in a $3.26 billion sale to Brazilian investment fund 3G Capital Management LLC. It went public through a “reverse-merger” in which Justice Holdings, a traded shell company co-founded by hedge fund veteran Bill Ackman, absorbed Burger King. Shares of Burger King, which debuted at $14.50 on June 20, closed at $14.95 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.

226,MCD,"Obama, buoyed by election win, faces new battles","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama had little time to savor victory on Wednesday after voters gave him a second term in the White House where he faces urgent economic challenges, a looming fiscal showdown and a still-divided Congress able to block his every move. Despite a decisive win over Republican Mitt Romney in Tuesday’s election, Obama must negotiate with a Republican majority in the House of Representatives to try to overcome the partisan gridlock that gripped Washington for much of his first term. The Democratic president’s most immediate concern is the “fiscal cliff” of scheduled tax increases and spending cuts that could crush the U.S. economic recovery if it kicks in at the start of next year. The prospect of Obama and Congress struggling to agree on the issue weighed heavily on global financial markets on Wednesday and helped send Wall Street stocks into a post-election swoon. Obama also faces challenges abroad including the West’s nuclear standoff with Iran, the civil war in Syria, the winding down of the war in Afghanistan and dealing with an increasingly assertive China. At home, Obama’s triumph could embolden him in his dealings with the Republicans, who were in disarray after failing to unseat him or reclaim control of the U.S. Senate, an outcome many conservatives had predicted. Their party is now headed for a period of painful soul-searching. Voters gave Obama a second chance despite stubbornly high unemployment and a weak economic recovery, but they preserved the status quo of divided government in Washington. Obama’s fellow Democrats retained control of the Senate and Republicans kept their majority in the House, giving them power to curb the president’s legislative ambitions on everything from taxes to immigration reform. This is the political reality facing Obama - who won a far narrower victory over Romney than his historic 2008 victory over John McCain when he became the country’s first black president. He headed back to Washington on Wednesday after basking in the glow of his re-election together with thousands of elated supporters at a victory rally in his hometown of Chicago in the early hours of the morning. “We can seize this future together because we are not as divided as our politics suggests,” Obama told the gathering. Before leaving Chicago, he visited his downtown campaign headquarters to thank staff and volunteers. Romney, a multimillionaire former private equity executive, came back from a series of campaign stumbles to fight a close battle after besting Obama in the first of three presidential debates. But the former Massachusetts governor failed to convince voters of his argument that his business experience made him the best candidate to repair a weak U.S. economy. Trying to make good on his promise to seek compromise, Obama followed up in telephone calls with congressional leaders, including the two top Republican lawmakers, John Boehner and Mitch McConnell, to express his determination to work together. “The president reiterated his commitment to finding bipartisan solutions to: reduce our deficit in a balanced way, cut taxes for middle-class families and small businesses and create jobs,” a White House official said. The problems that dogged Obama in his first term, which cast a long shadow over his 2008 campaign message of hope and change, still confront him. He must tackle the $1 trillion annual deficits, rein in the $16 trillion national debt and overhaul expensive social programs. The most urgent focus for Obama and U.S. lawmakers will be to deal with the “fiscal cliff,” a mix of tax increases and spending cuts due to extract some $600 billion from the economy starting early next year, barring a deal with Congress. Economists warn it could push the United States back into recession. Obama has pledged to increase tax rates on Americans earning more than $250,000 as a part of his “balanced approach” to deficit reduction - something Republicans still vow to resist. In remarks to reporters, House Speaker Boehner struck a conciliatory tone but stuck to the Republican position that they will consider boosting revenues to help reduce deficits, but only as a “byproduct” of tax reform that lowers rates and eliminates loopholes and deductions. Boehner said lawmakers and Obama should find a short-term solution to avoid the fiscal cliff and work on a long-term debt reduction plan in 2013. “In order to garner Republican support for new revenues, the president must be willing to reduce spending and shore up the entitlement programs that are the primary drivers of our debt,” Boehner said. Senate Republican leader McConnell gave no sign he was willing to concede his conservative principles. “The voters have not endorsed the failures or excesses of the president’s first term, they have simply given him more time to finish the job they asked him to do together with a Congress that restored balance to Washington after two years of one-party control,” McConnell said. Vice President Joe Biden told reporters the election delivered a mandate on moving closer to the administration’s views on tax policy, and Republicans would have to do some “soul-searching” about issues they would be willing to compromise on, according to a pool report. Post-election concern about U.S. fiscal problems contributed to a fall in global financial markets as jittery investors scrambled for less-risky assets. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell more than 2 percent, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing more than 300 points and the S&P; 500 posting its biggest drop since June. Euro zone debt worries were also a factor in the market decline. The nationwide popular vote in Tuesday’s election was extremely close with Obama taking about 50 percent to 48 percent for Romney after a campaign in which the candidates and their party allies spent a combined $2 billion. But in the state-by-state system of electoral votes that decides the White House, Obama notched up a comfortable victory. By late on Wednesday, he had 303 electoral votes, well over the 270 needed to win, to Romney’s 206. Florida’s close race was not yet declared, leaving its 29 electoral votes still to be claimed. The Republican Party, after losing the past two presidential contests, is expected to analyze at length what went wrong and how to fix it, especially how it has alienated Hispanic voters who were an important constituency in Obama’s victory. Some critics have argued that the Republican Party, with its conservative Tea Party faction, have moved too far from the American mainstream to attract enough independent voters to reclaim the White House. “The fact is, Republicans are going to have to do a lot of rethinking at the presidential level,” Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker who lost the Republican nominating race to Romney, told CBS’s “This Morning” program. Obama’s win put to rest the prospect of wholesale repeal of his 2010 healthcare reform law. Obama, who took office in 2009 as the ravages of the financial crisis were hitting the U.S. economy, must continue his efforts to ignite strong growth and recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. An uneven recovery has been showing some signs of strength but the country’s jobless rate, at 7.9 percent, remains stubbornly high. Obama may now reshuffle his cabinet. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton plan to step down soon. Democrats widened their control of the 100-member Senate by two. The Republican majority in the 435-member House means that Congress still faces a deep partisan divide. “That means the same dynamic. That means the same people who couldn’t figure out how to cut deals for the past three years,” said Ethan Siegel, an analyst who tracks Washington politics for institutional investors.

227,MCD,"McDonald's posts rare sales drop, promotions questioned","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s first monthly global restaurant sales decline in nine years is likely to force the world’s biggest hamburger chain to increase promotions for its value menu, but some analysts doubt whether a hyper focus on low prices is the right strategy. The loss of customers to rival chains such as Burger King and Taco Bell is a huge test for CEO Don Thompson, who took over in July when the chain was enjoying a multi-year run of rising sales and profits. McDonald’s shares touched a 52-week low on Thursday after the company said October global sales at established restaurants posted their first monthly decline since March, 2003. Shares are down more than 15 percent from their all-time high. Several analysts predicted McDonald’s would ramp up value-oriented promotions to stop market share losses. “We anticipate management to respond quickly with heightened advertising to emphasize its value offerings,” Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matthew DiFrisco said. Others said the October results showed such a strategy would not work. “Obviously, it’s not working,” Investment Technology Group analyst Steve West said of McDonald’s current value focus.

A year ago, McDonald’s was expanding its McCafe beverage line and bringing in customers with one new product hit after another. Now, it’s promoting cheddar bacon onion premium sandwiches and plans to bring back the McRib - a cult favorite - for a limited time later this year. “Where’s the excitement? People like to try different things,” West said. McDonald’s said October sales at worldwide restaurants open at least 13 months dropped 1.8 percent. Last month, the chain famous for its french fries, Big Macs and Chicken McNuggets warned that a weak global economy has heightened competition as diners are less eager to spend money on restaurant food. “McDonald’s has been out there promoting price ferociously now for quite some time,” said Emil Brolick, president and CEO at Wendy’s. On Thursday, Wendy’s reported a small rise in same-restaurant sales for the third quarter, helped by new products like its bacon portobello melt sandwich. McDonald’s is in many ways a victim of its own success, said analysts. For now, they are giving a pass to Thompson, the new chief executive. For years, McDonald’s has set the bar for growth ever higher by outpacing rivals and turning in strong sales despite modest consumer spending around the world. “This has nothing to do with Don being in charge. It’s just a matter of bad timing and bad luck,” Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said. He also said superstorm Sandy, which hit the U.S. Northeast at the end of October, could weigh on November sales. Analysts said it will be difficult for McDonald’s to put up higher same-restaurant sales until spring because year-earlier results were so strong. McDonald’s shares touched a 52-week low of $84.96 on the New York Stock Exchange, and closed down 2 percent at $85.13. Shares in Wendy’s gained 3.1 percent to $4.39. October sales at McDonald’s restaurants open at least 13 months fell 2.2 percent in both the United States and Europe, and dropped 2.4 percent in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region. While the sales declines were expected, they were steeper than Wall Street estimated in the United States and Europe.

235,MCD,"Wal-Mart moves up dividend to avoid ""fiscal cliff'","(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Monday became the biggest corporation yet to move its planned dividend into late December from early January to help shareholders avoid a looming jump in the tax rate due to the so-called fiscal cliff. The shift by the world’s largest retailer will give shareholders, including the family of founder Sam Walton, roughly $1.34 billion in total dividend payments taxed at the current rate. Fiscal years for retailers typically end in late January, so their dividend payments often are timed differently from those of other types of companies. Exxon Mobil Corp, for instance, had already planned for payouts in December. “There are complex fiscal and federal tax rate issues that may not be resolved in the next few weeks, despite the ongoing good faith negotiations between the administration and Congress to resolve details related to the fiscal cliff,” Wal-Mart said in a statement. “In light of this uncertainty, the board determined that moving our dividend payment up by a few days to 2012 was in the best interests of our shareholders.” Teen apparel chains Hot Topic Inc and The Buckle Inc already said they would move dividends typically paid in January into December to allow shareholders to benefit from the lower tax rate set to expire this year. Adding to what has become a clamor for the White House and legislators on Capitol Hill to compromise, the Fitch ratings agency said on Monday that the “fiscal cliff” could trigger a recession and push the unemployment rate above 10 percent. Fitch said it did not expect the tax hikes and spending cuts to occur. The investment firm Morgan Stanley Smith Barney also said in a market commentary on Monday that it thought Washington would “act to mitigate and delay” the cliff. Robert Greifeld, chief executive of NASDAQ, the second-largest stock exchange, called on Democrats and Republicans to rediscover the ability to compromise and commit to a long-term plan to reduce the national debt. Republicans must budge on tax increases and Democrats must give ground on spending cuts, Greifeld said in a Monday speech at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank. Without action from Congress, the dividend tax rate will rise to the ordinary income tax rates, as high as 39.6 percent for top earners. Dividends are now taxed at 15 percent for the top four brackets and zero at the bottom. In 2003, President George W. Bush and Congress cut taxes on capital gains and dividends, which mostly affect high-income taxpayers. These cuts are set to expire at the end of 2012. President Barack Obama proposed raising dividend taxes back to ordinary income tax rates in his most recent budget, but many Washington insiders believe Democrats will settle on a rate of 20 percent if a deal is struck. The Democratic-led Senate passed a bill this year extending the disputed Bush-era tax rates for the middle class and letting rates for the wealthiest taxpayers go up. But within that legislation, Senate Democrats proposed a 20 percent dividend tax rate - not Obama’s preferred higher rate. Add in the new investment tax from Obama’s health care law, and dividend taxes would rise to 23.8 percent. Dividend-paying companies including Altria Group Inc, AT&T; Inc and Verizon Communications Inc are among those pressing lawmakers to avoid a tax hike, with executives and surrogates making frequent visits to Capitol Hill. The family of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton owns roughly half the company’s shares and probably would pay much higher taxes on dividends paid after December 31 unless Congress takes action. Two of Sam Walton’s sons, Rob Walton and Jim Walton, are board members, and Chairman Rob Walton’s son-in-law, Gregory Penner, is also on the board. The Waltons and Penner recused themselves from the board discussion and vote on the dividend date change, Wal-Mart said. Rob Walton and Jim Walton are the 9th and 7th richest Americans, respectively, according to Forbes. Two other members of the Walton family are also listed in the top 10. Wal-Mart’s board approved changing the payment date of the quarterly dividend of 39.75 cents per share to December 27 from January 2. The record date associated with the payout remains December 7. Shares of Wal-Mart rose almost 1.5 percent to close at $69.02 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Technology stocks were the S&P; 500’s best-performing sector as Hewlett-Packard Co climbed 2.9 percent to $14.20 on rumors that activist investor Carl Icahn is building a stake in the PC maker. The stock is down 44.5 percent for the year and ranks as the Dow’s worst performer. Tech was also supported by Cisco Systems, which gained 2.4 percent to $19.79 after the company presented its midterm growth strategy on Friday. Monday’s rally put the stock on track for its fifth advance in the past six sessions. [I D :nL1E8N76OF] U.S. President Barack Obama met with Republican House Speaker John Boehner on Sunday to negotiate a budget deal. A Boehner aide said Monday that talks are continuing. Persistent worries about the negotiations over the “fiscal cliff,” a series of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts that could hurt economic growth next year, have kept market moves small of late. “There is a general sense that if a deal is struck, that we could have a further advance in the market at the end of this year as well as the first part of next year,” said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut. The benchmark S&P; 500 index has yet to see a move greater than 0.5 percent in either direction for December, and hasn’t moved more than 1 percent either way since Nov. 23. However, the market has regained most of the losses incurred post-election as investors refocused on the fiscal cliff. McDonald’s Corp gave the Dow a jolt, gaining 1.4 percent to $89.69, as its November sales were stronger than expected and showed a bounce back from a decline in October. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 23.03 points, or 0.18 percent, at 13,178.16. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 0.71 of a point, or 0.05 percent, at 1,418.78. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7.35 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,985.39. News out of Italy kept sentiment in check as Prime Minister Mario Monti said he would resign after the approval of the 2013 budget. The move added to uncertainty about progress being made to tackle the euro zone’s debt problem and drove Italy’s borrowing costs higher.

240,MCD,"McDonald's ""Dollar Menu"" sparks November sales rebound","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s (MCD.N) sales at established restaurants rose more than expected in November as a renewed emphasis on low-priced menu options, such as $1 Sausage McMuffins and coffee, helped the company bounce back from a rare decline in October, it said on Monday. Sales at restaurants open at least 13 months were up 2.4 percent in November, easily topping the tepid 0.17 percent increase expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix. Still, analysts said it was too early to say that the world’s biggest restaurant chain, known for its french fries and Big Macs, had regained its strong lead over rival fast-food chains. “One month does not a trend make ... but it’s a nice sign to see them rebound after a horrible October,” ITG Investment Research analyst Steve West said. In October, McDonald’s posted its first monthly drop in the closely-watched performance measure in nine years. Analysts expect volatile industry sales in the coming quarters as countries around the world grapple with economic woes and high unemployment. Profits could get squeezed as diners shop around for deals and restaurants respond by keeping prices down. “We are concerned about the margin outlook in this more promotional environment,” said Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matthew DiFrisco. The company’s business has softened in the United States, McDonald’s second-largest market, as revived rivals like Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N crank out new premium and value products. One week after McDonald’s announced disappointing October sales, it replaced Jan Fields, the president of its U.S. business. Jeff Stratton, who had been the company’s global restaurant officer, took over on December 1. U.S. sales at established restaurants rose 2.5 percent in November, while analysts had expected a small decline. McDonald’s “ramped up its value messaging, focusing heavily on the Dollar Menu to help drive traffic,” Jefferies & Co restaurant analyst Andy Barish said in a research note. The company has been promoting both the Dollar Menu and its Extra Value Menu, which includes offerings like 20 Chicken McNuggets for $4.99, to lure diners. McDonald’s attributed the results to the Dollar Menu, breakfast and its beverage menu. But it also said limited-time offerings like cheddar, bacon and onion burgers and chicken sandwiches had bolstered sales. U.S. results in December should benefit from the return of the popular McRib sandwich, but analysts said McDonald’s still needs to come up with more new food launches. Same-restaurant sales rose 1.4 percent in Europe, McDonald’s biggest market, compared with calls for a 0.1 percent increase. Results were stronger in the UK and Russia, which were boosted by limited-time promotions, while Germany continued to be a drag.

Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa turned in a 0.6 percent increase, compared with the average forecast of a 0.9 percent decline.

Developments in Europe also tempered sentiment after Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti said he would resign once the 2013 budget is approved. The move added to uncertainty about reducing euro zone debt and drove Italy’s borrowing costs higher. U.S. President Barack Obama met with Republican House Speaker John Boehner on Sunday to negotiate a deal for avoiding the “fiscal cliff” that is set to go into effect in the new year. The two sides declined to provide details about the unannounced meeting. Obama is expected to make remarks at 2 p.m.  (1900 GMT) from Michigan where he is touring an auto plant. The fiscal cliff talks have kept markets on edge in the last month as investors worry the scheduled measures could send the economy into recession if politicians do not reach a deal. While the negotiations are at the forefront of investors’ minds, most have adopted the position that a deal will be reached, even if it is at the last minute, said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. “We haven’t had any ‘progress’ the last two weeks or so, yet all in all equity markets have continued to hang tough,” said Detrick. “The rhetoric from Washington is strong, but Wall Street is betting something probably will get done.” The Dow was helped by a gain in McDonald’s Corp. The fast food chain’s stronger-than-expected November sales marked a rebound after a decline in October. The stock was up 1 percent at $89.33.

246,MCD,McDonald's COO urges franchisees to open on Christmas: Ad Age,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) is urging U.S. restaurant owners to take the unusual step of opening on Christmas Day to deliver the world’s biggest hamburger chain with the gift of higher December sales, AdvertsingAge reported on Monday. The request - which comes as McDonald’s tangles with resurgent rivals such as Wendy’s (WEN.O), Burger King BKW.N and Yum Brands’ (YUM.N) Taco Bell chain - would be a break from company tradition of closing on major holidays. “Starting with Thanksgiving, ensure your restaurants are open throughout the holidays,” Jim Johannesen, chief operations officer for McDonald’s USA, wrote in a November 8 memo to franchisees - one of two obtained by AdvertisingAge. “Our largest holiday opportunity as a system is Christmas Day. Last year, (company-operated) restaurants that opened on Christmas averaged $5,500 in sales,” Johannesen said. “The decision to open our restaurants on Christmas is in the hands of our owner/operators,” McDonald’s spokeswoman Heather Oldani told Reuters. Don Thompson took over as chief executive at McDonald’s in July and has the difficult task of growing sales on top of last year’s strong results in a significantly more competitive environment. McDonald’s monthly global sales at established restaurants fell for the first time in nine years in October, but unexpectedly rebounded in November. The November surprise was partly due to a 2.5 percent rise in sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months. “Our November results were driven, in part, by our Thanksgiving Day performance,” Johannesen wrote in a December 12 memo to franchisees. Oldani said 1,200 more McDonald’s restaurants were open on Thanksgiving this year versus last year - not 6,000 more as AdvertisingAge reported. Still, the company has a high hurdle when it comes to posting an increase in restaurant sales this month because its U.S. same-restaurant sales jumped 9.8 percent in December 2011. “It’s an act of desperation. The franchisees are not happy,” said Richard Adams, a former McDonald’s franchisee who now advises the chain’s owner/operators. The push to open on the holidays goes against McDonald’s cultural history, said Adams. In his first published operations manual, McDonald’s Corp founder Ray Kroc said the company would close on Thanksgiving and Christmas to give employees time with their families, Adams said. “We opened for breakfast on Thanksgiving the last couple years I was a franchisee. It was easy to get kids to work on Thanksgiving because they want to get away from their family, but not on Christmas,” Adams said.

248,MCD,"CORRECTED-China closes 2 suppliers for KFC, McDonald's in safety probe - media","(Corrects spelling of McDonald’s in headline and body of story) SHANGHAI, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Food safety authorities have shut down two chicken farms in eastern China, including one that supplied Yum Brands Inc’s KFC and McDonald’s Corp , the official Shanghai Daily reported on Thursday. The closures come after a report by state television earlier this week that some poultry suppliers in Shandong province had accelerated the growth of chickens by using chemical-laced feed. The two slaughterhouses in Shandong have been ordered to halt production and seal all raw chicken products until samples can be tested, the newspaper said. The paper, citing a report from Shandong’s animal husbandry and veterinary bureau, said the “relevant people responsible for these farms have been detained by police or are under further investigation”. Officials at the bureau could not be reached by Reuters for comment. The Shanghai Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also conducting tests on poultry supplied to a Yum Brands logistics centre in Shanghai, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Results from this test are expected as early as Thursday, the Shanghai Daily said. KFC’s Chinese subsidiary has pledged to work with authorities, while McDonald’s wrote on its official microblog that its chicken and raw materials pass through independent, third-party laboratory tests. China has been trying to stamp out health violations that have dogged the country’s food sector and includes reports of fake cooking oil, tainted milk and even exploding watermelons. In 2008, milk laced with the industrial chemical melamine killed at least six children and sickened nearly 300,000. Yum Brands warned in November that it expects sales at established restaurants in China to fall 4 percent in the fourth quarter, despite an improvement in economic indicators such as consumer confidence and retail sales.

253,MCD,China media train fire on U.S. food giants over chicken scare,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Just weeks after Chinese authorities cleared Yum Brands Inc and McDonald’s Corp of charges they had served chicken laced with excessive chemicals, local media are again attacking the iconic American firms, while barely reporting on the chances of Chinese restaurants selling similar meat. The official Shanghai Daily, citing a report from the central government’s news portal china.com.cn, said on Thursday one of China’s largest suppliers to McDonald’s and Yum’s KFC and had bought sick chicken from farms and sold them to the food outlets - a claim a local government in the central province of Henan said was untrue after a preliminary investigation. Chinese newspapers and websites have also criticized some domestic firms, but industry experts say multinationals are hotter targets given the high profile of their brands. “KFC and McDonald’s get media attention because they’re the biggest fast-food chains in China. Everyone knows them and everyone talks about them,” said Tan Xiaoxue, a reporter at Sohu.com Inc’s news portal. “There are some local chains such as Country Style Cooking, but they cannot be compared with international brands, which have much bigger brand recognition and consumer impact.” In the latest chicken scare case, china.com.cn quoted an unidentified official at Doyoo Group - which sells chicken to KFC and McDonald’s - plus employees at Doyoo’s suppliers as saying chicken that fell ill were slaughtered and shipped to fast food restaurants including the two American giants. However, the government of Doyoo’s home city Hebi said on Wednesday that it had found no evidence of this in a preliminary probe, and authorities were looking into the case more closely. In response to the china.com.cn report, Yum’s China unit said it will closely monitor the situation. “If Doyoo is found to have committed any wrongdoings, it will be subject to severe punishment,” it said via its official microblog account. Officials at McDonald’s in China and at Doyoo could not be reached for comment despite repeated calls by Reuters. Last week, Yum warned that sales in China - where it earns over half of its worldwide revenue and operating profit - shrank more than expected in the fourth quarter, citing bad publicity from a government review of its chicken supply. The firm has been embroiled over the past month in a scare triggered by an official China Central Television report which said some chicken supplied to KFC and McDonald’s contained excess amounts of antiviral drugs and growth hormones. On investigation, the Shanghai Food and Drug Administration found the levels of antibiotics and steroids in KFC chicken were safe, though the watchdog found a suspicious level of an antiviral drug in one of the eight samples tested. Yum apologized last week to customers over the handling of that scare, but state-run Xinhua news agency immediately weighed in with an editorial on Saturday slamming the U.S. firm. “Yum’s understated apology is rooted in its arrogance and propensity for unfairly treating Chinese consumers, who usually regard foreign brands as being safer and of higher quality than domestic brands,” Xinhua said. “Other multinational companies have displayed the same attitude, capitalizing on loopholes in Chinese law and regulations to escape punishment.” Kevin Der Arslanian, a business analyst at China Market Research Group in Shanghai, said the government is taking a firm stance against foreign companies especially in the food sector given high public concerns over safety. “They are being harsh on them to show that they are aware of these worries when it comes to food safety,” he said. “I don’t think it’s unfair that they’re specifically targeting foreign brands. These foreign brands and KFC in particular have positioned themselves as extremely healthful and extremely high quality, and therefore if there are scandals it is only fair that they be hit the hardest.” Still, not all local news outlets are joining the attack. Chen Xiaoxiang, a reporter at Hangzhou city newspaper Metropolis Express said his editors chose not to cover the KFC stories because safety violations are a bigger problem for domestic companies. “We believe that these international companies are already operating in a relatively well regulated way, and compared with many small Chinese workshop-style food chains, they are more trustworthy,” he said. “Their problems are often minor compared with quality problems at many local companies ...

257,MCD,McDonald's running low on quick fixes for U.S. sales,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) is running out of quick-fix strategies for stemming declines in U.S. restaurant sales inflicted by tougher competition for customers who are pinching pennies in a weak economic recovery. The world’s largest restaurant chain by revenue welcomed customers on Christmas Day and shifted the limited offering of its cult favorite McRib sandwich into December to avoid a big year-end decline in its U.S. restaurant business. But, it appears the company has exhausted its supply of such tactics. “There are no Band-Aids for January, February and March,” said Richard Adams, a former McDonald’s franchisee who now advises the chain’s restaurant operators. “There’s not too much they can do about it. There’s no holiday they can stay open on.” McDonald’s posts December sales and fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Analysts on average forecast $1.33 a share, flat from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. A bump in the road late last year endangered the company’s established dominance over the fast-food industry and turned up the heat on Chief Executive Don Thompson. Thompson took the helm in July, as rivals such as Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N were making a comeback by mimicking McDonald’s turnaround strategy with expanded menus, renovated restaurants and longer hours. The CEO already has shaken up the executive suite, replacing the president of U.S. operations a week after the company in October reported a decline in monthly global sales at established restaurants - the first such drop in nine years. Analysts and investors say McDonald’s will keep using its size to its advantage. And, it should have an easier go of things in mid-2013, when the year-earlier impact of balmy winter weather wanes. Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at Oakbrook Investments, which owns McDonald’s stock, is keeping the faith. “We have every confidence that McDonald’s will rise to the challenge,” he said. Shares in McDonald’s were about flat at $92.85 on Tuesday, down more than 9 percent from a year ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI., of which McDonald’s is a component, is up more than 7 percent over the same period. SHORT-TERM SOFTNESS? Unseasonably warm temperatures helped McDonald’s dish up big gains in December 2011 sales at established restaurants in the United States, its second-largest market for sales just behind Europe. That set up a high hurdle for restaurant sales growth in December 2012. And, McDonald’s faces similarly large challenges in the first three months of this year. Fifteen analysts polled by Consensus Metrix expect McDonald’s to post a small decline - 0.54 percent - in December 2012 sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months when it reports on Wednesday. That would be a big reversal from December 2011’s 9.8 percent gain. Calling Christmas Day the company’s largest holiday sales opportunity, the chief operations officer for McDonald’s USA urged franchisees to break with tradition and open their doors. The company also moved the start of its McRib sandwich promotion from October to December. If not for those two moves, analysts said, December same-restaurant sales would have seen a much larger drop. McDonald’s also has been doubling down on its low-price Dollar Menu promotions to attract more customers, many of whom have been pinching pennies on meals away from home. Such “value” menu sales can squeeze profits if customers do not also purchase higher-margin add-ons like drinks and premium items, so investors are keeping an eye on profitability at McDonald’s. The chain’s U.S. growth in average check - a gauge of restaurant performance - was flat for 2012 while the overall fast-food industry was up 2.2 percent, ITG Investment Research analyst Steve West said, citing his firm’s data. The company’s average check was up less than the industry in the first and second quarters of 2012. It diverged in the third and fourth quarters, falling slightly as the overall industry gained, said West. McDonald’s has a track record for taking items sold by other chains and putting its own spin on them. Its recent McCafe roll out of coffee, smoothies and other drinks was a huge success. Still, some analysts worry that the company - which is testing its own version of chicken wings - lacks plans for tempting new food to compete with the flurry of new products being introduced by smaller and more nimble rivals. “Nobody wants the same old thing at McDonald’s,” West said.

258,MCD,McDonald's says January restaurant sales will fall,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) on Wednesday forecast a decline in global restaurant sales for January, as it and other fast-food chains fight for customers who are spending cautiously during continued economic uncertainty. The world’s biggest restaurant company by revenue also reported an unexpected rise in December sales at established U.S. outlets, which helped lift its fourth-quarter profit above analysts’ estimates. Wall Street expected the early part of 2013 to be tough for McDonald’s as it runs short of quick fixes for its business in the United States, and bumps up against strong year-earlier results that were bolstered by unseasonably warm weather. McDonald’s forecast for a decline in this month’s global same-restaurant sales suggests a “pretty clear drop off between December (2012) and January (2013),” Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy said. Global same-restaurant sales were flat in December, aided by an unexpected 0.9 percent rise in the United States - its second-largest market for revenue behind Europe. The company’s push to keep more restaurants open on Christmas Day and its shift of the limited-time offering of the popular McRib sandwich to December from October bolstered the December U.S. results. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected those sales to drop 1.78 percent. McDonald’s expects near-term top and bottom-line growth to remain pressured in part because the company must top strong results from a year ago, Chief Executive Don Thompson said on a conference call with analysts. Last year’s global sales at McDonald’s restaurants open at least 13 months increased 6.7 percent for January and 7.3 percent for the first quarter. Fast-food chains like Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N and Yum Brands Inc’s (YUM.N) Taco Bell have introduced new U.S. menus and are doing a better job of competing with McDonald’s. At the same time, U.S. consumers have less money in their pockets since the end of the payroll tax cut. “We suspect choppy demand trends and the impact of the loss of the payroll tax deduction (in the United States) are in part to blame” for the company’s downbeat guidance, Lazard Capital Markets analyst Matthew DiFrisco said in a client note. And, in what could signal a troubling “trade-out” trend for restaurants in 2013, U.S. consumers last month made their biggest spending shift from restaurants to grocery stores since August 2011, ITG Investment Research analyst Steve West said. Fourth-quarter net income at the world’s biggest restaurant chain rose 1.4 percent to $1.40 billion, or $1.38 per share. That topped analysts’ average forecast of $1.33 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total sales rose 1.9 percent to $6.95 billion. To continue to remain competitive, McDonald’s doubled down on promoting its value menus - such as the U.S. Dollar Menu. That effort has pressured profitability, raising concern among analysts. The company’s shares gained 60 cents, or 0.62 percent, to $93.54 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Chinese authorities have cleared McDonald’s and KFC owner Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) of charges they had served chicken laced with excessive chemicals, but the iconic U.S. chains - long considered to serve safer and higher quality food than domestic chains - remain under fire from local media and consumers.

McDonald’s sales at established restaurants for China fell 0.9 percent during the fourth quarter. “We are committed to ensuring the highest food safety and quality standards are met around the world,” Thompson said. Earlier this month Yum apologized to customers in China over its handling of the scare, which is hitting sales in its biggest market.

265,MCD,"P&G; posts solid quarter, gives CEO more breathing room","(Reuters) - What a difference a year makes for Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and CEO Bob McDonald. Last February, he unveiled a $10 billion restructuring including thousands of job cuts after the world’s largest household products company admitted it was not nimble enough, especially in emerging markets. In April, Wall Street analysts roasted McDonald on a conference call after P&G;’s latest profit warning and having to rescind some price increases. The dour performance prompted activist investor Bill Ackman to call for change last summer when he bought the shares. Since then, McDonald has refocused the world’s largest household products maker on winning back market share for products ranging from Gillette razors to Tide detergent. On Friday, Procter & Gamble delivered its strongest indication yet that its turnaround efforts are paying off, posting a better-than-expected profit and improved forecasts, helped by U.S. hits such as Tide Pods and new hair care products under the Vidal Sassoon brand. The results and rosy outlook - it was the first time the company raised its annual profit forecast since April 2010 - led to a 4 percent rise in P&G;’s stock price, setting a high for McDonald’s 3-1/2 year tenure. Even Ackman, who for months has blamed McDonald’s team for earlier missteps, said on CNBC that the results were an indication of “very significant progress.” Friday’s report showed better-than-expected profit, helped in part by a gain from an acquisition, and sales that surpassed expectations, with growth in all divisions. Even so, some analysts think the company still has more to accomplish. “The results are pretty good, but you know what? We know we’re not done yet, we know this is work in progress, we know we have more to do,” McDonald said in an interview. P&G;’s long-term goals, along with cutting costs and developing more innovative products, include getting sales to grow 1 to 2 percentage points ahead of the market pace. “They’ve been stuck in the mud for years, and this is kind of a ray of hope for the company and they should be commended on the quarter,” said Channing Smith, co-manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund (CIAOX.O). P&G; represents 2 percent of that fund and the firm overall holds roughly 75,000 shares of P&G.; It has taken P&G; months to reignite growth in sluggish markets such as the United States while also expanding in emerging markets, where products are typically less expensive. P&G; expects Tide Pods, the single-dose detergent launched in the United States in 2012, to become a $500 million brand this year. It says the premium-priced product is attracting both loyal Tide users and those who used to buy less expensive brands. Tide Pods will be followed by an Ariel-branded version of the product in Europe this spring. Other launches this year include updated Pantene and Vidal Sassoon hair care products, as well as new versions of Bounty paper towels. Last summer, Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management bought P&G;’s shares and began pushing for more change. While results have improved since then, P&G;’s growth still lags that of peers such as Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS). P&G;’s organic sales, which strip out the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, grew 3 percent last quarter, while Unilever’s sales rose 6.9 percent. P&G;’s rivals such as Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) and Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) have done well in recent years while Procter struggled, and now perhaps it has the firepower to bounce back, said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo. “Procter’s been left out of the party a little bit, so it’s nice to see them reappear here and kind of exert their influence on the group,” he said. Ackman’s Pershing Square has a 1.02 percent stake in P&G;, making it the company’s eighth-largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. Ackman said in the fall he understood the board wanted to give McDonald more time to repair years of damage. “When the company is performing, obviously the pressure from Ackman will probably fade somewhat,” said Capital Advisors’ Smith, adding that while he does not know Ackman’s intentions, it is clear that Ackman’s investment in P&G; is worth a lot more today than when he bought the shares. Ackman spoke about P&G; on CNBC on Friday, saying that over the last three years it “certainly looked like” McDonald was not the right person for the job. He added, “if the company can make dramatic progress - and I think this quarter is an indication of very significant progress - then I hope that Bob can be successful and can make it.” McDonald did not say whether he has spoken with Ackman lately, but said he considers it a great honor to lead P&G;, which he joined in 1980. “I’m totally focused on doing what I have to do,” he said. Even before Ackman took a stake, P&G; was going through a $10 billion restructuring and other changes. It cut 5,500 nonmanufacturing jobs through December, near its goal of reducing 5,700 positions by the end of June. Competitors such as Colgate and Kimberly-Clark are also trimming their ranks. Meanwhile, rival Kimberly-Clark also posted a better-than-expected profit on Friday. P&G; has seen U.S. volume growth continue in January, said Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller. At the same time, it believes it can improve market share in Europe over the next few months. Some analysts still see room for improvement. Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Astrachan called the results “solid and encouraging,” particularly the sales growth, but said P&G; still lags in categories with strong growth trends, such as beauty. P&G; earned $4.06 billion, or $1.39 per share, in the fiscal second quarter ended in December, up from $1.69 billion, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier. Stripping out unusual items such as restructuring charges and acquisitions, P&G; earned $1.22 per share. That topped the company’s own forecast of $1.07 to $1.13 per share and analysts’ average target of $1.11, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 2 percent to $22.18 billion, topping analysts’ forecast of $21.91 billion. P&G; expects fiscal 2013 core earnings of $3.97 to $4.07 per share, up from an earlier forecast of $3.80 to $4. Analyst estimates were at the bottom of that new range. It expects organic sales to rise 3 to 4 percent this year, narrowing a prior forecast of 2 to 4 percent growth. P&G; also said it now plans to repurchase $5 billion to $6 billion in stock after calling for $4 billion to $6 billion in buybacks. For the current quarter, P&G; forecast core earnings per share of 91 to 97 cents, with sales up 3 to 4 percent. Analysts’ average forecast was 95 cents per share.

267,MCD,Analysis: Beef price spike makes $1 McDouble harder to stomach,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s popular $1 McDouble cheeseburger, which has lured customers to the Golden Arches since 2008, is getting hard to sustain as rising beef prices threaten the company’s profit margin. The world’s biggest restaurant chain launched a competing $1 Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger in December. It also made the new sandwich - with one beef patty rather than the McDouble’s two - a star of current television commercials, a status it shares with the McDouble. The dilemma for McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) restaurant operators is that the McDouble has the highest ingredient costs on the Dollar Menu, making it a bad financial proposition unless customers add high-margin sides such as french fries or soda. “If the McDouble is all the customer buys, you lose money,” said Richard Adams, a former franchisee who now advises the chain’s restaurant operators. “Depending on what happens to beef prices, McDonald’s management should be open to taking the McDouble off the Dollar Menu.” The decision would be a significant one. McDonald’s gets 10 to 15 percent of its sales from the Dollar Menu and experts say the McDouble is one of the most popular items on it. Many franchisees, who pay royalties to the parent company based on overall sales, have exercised their option to move the McDouble off the Dollar Menu by raising its price over $1. Reuters’ checks of McDonald’s restaurants in more than a dozen U.S. cities found that franchisees sell the McDouble for $1.09 in San Francisco, $1.19 in Los Angeles, $1.80 in Kodiak, Alaska and $1.89 in New York City. The McDouble was not even offered on menus at restaurants Reuters visited in Chicago and Boston, but was available on request for $1.29 and $1.49, respectively. It remains on the Dollar Menu in cities such as Phoenix, Fresno, Denver, Seattle, St. Louis and Washington, DC. McDonald’s is “committed to the Dollar Menu and the McDouble, and both are strongly supported by the majority of our franchisees,” spokeswoman Danya Proud said in a statement. “To comment on future national changes would be inaccurate and speculative.” The Dollar Menu food and marketing changes are part of McDonald’s plan to stop two consecutive years of margin declines at its 14,000 U.S. restaurants. They come as new McDonald’s Chief Executive Don Thompson sharpens the company’s focus on its famed Dollar Menu to lure cash-crunched diners and fend off resurgent rivals such as Yum Brands Inc’s (YUM.N) Taco Bell chain and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N. They also hint at strategies that U.S. restaurants could use to contain the damage from higher beef costs. McDonald’s has a history of shaking up the Dollar Menu lineup in response to food cost spikes. In December 2008, the company raised the price of its flagship Double Cheeseburger to $1.19 from $1 and handed its Dollar Menu slot to the McDouble, which is essentially a Double Cheeseburger minus one slice of cheese. That coincided with U.S. wholesale food price increases of 7.6 percent in 2007 and 7.7 percent in 2008. McDonald’s moved again in March 2012 after wholesale food prices spiked, replacing the Dollar Menu’s small drinks and small french fries with fresh baked cookies and ice cream cones. At the same time, it debuted a new “Extra Value Menu” category for items priced between $1 and $2. Competing hamburger chains stole a page from McDonald’s and shuffled their value menu lineups. Burger King quickly followed McDonald’s with similar moves and Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) plans to replace its 99-cent menu with a 99-cent to $1.99 “Right Price Right Size Menu.” Beef prices are expected to rise above recent highs and to stay high for at least the next two years as the effects of last summer’s historic U.S. drought ripple through the food system, said Jim Robb, an economist at the Livestock Marketing Information Center. Ground beef prices already are up 6 percent to 8 percent so far this year, said John Davie, CEO of Consolidated Concepts, a firm that helps restaurants negotiate purchases. To be sure, McDonald’s is known for using its massive size to squeeze better prices out of suppliers. The company forecast commodity inflation of just 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent this year for its U.S. business, far less than the National Restaurant Association’s expectation for 2013 wholesale food price inflation in the low 4 percent range. But analysts are skeptical that McDonald’s can control rising prices as well as it thinks, meaning there could be even more pressure on the McDouble’s bottom line. “It’s possible that they hit it, but I would say the odds are low that they hit it,” Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Howard Penney said of McDonald’s and its commodity cost forecast. He expected the company to raise that view at some point this year.

268,MCD,RPT-Big Mac prices show which euro zone states best at belt-tightening,"BRUSSELS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Forget about statistics for employment and industrial production, it is being claimed that the price of a hamburger is showing where Europe’s economic reforms are working - and where they are not. By studying the different prices for McDonald’s Big Mac burger throughout the euro zone between July 2011 and January 2013, Guntram Wolff, an economist at think-tank Bruegel, found evidence that struggling countries like Ireland had  tightened their belts and others had not. The price of a Big Mac has been used by The Economist for decades as a partially tongue-in-cheek way of judging global currency valuations - the gist being that it costs the same to make but is charged at different prices around the world. Wolff took the data and found that the price rise in Greece,  Portugal and Spain has been less than the euro zone average, while in Ireland the price actually fell. These are the main countries undergoing deep economic reform due to the debt crisis. This contrasts with price rises above the euro zone burger average in Germany. Wolff concludes from this that economic adjustment is  working. For example, In Ireland, which has made spending cuts after receiving international aid, the burger price has fallen  from 3.80 euros to less than 3.50 euros. There is one notable exception, however. Heavily-indebted Italy is the most expensive country in the euro area to buy a Big Mac - 3.85 euros - while it costs just 3.64 euros in Germany. “Italy,” said Wolff, “needs to apply the right policies to address high inflation.” ",2062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-economy-bigmac/rpt-big-mac-prices-show-which-euro-zone-states-best-at-belt-tightening-idUSL5N0B6F7U20130206

272,MCD,McDonald's January sales drop more than anticipated,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) said on Friday that January sales at established restaurants around the world fell 1.9 percent, a steeper decline than expected as fast-food chains fight for diners. McDonald’s warned last month that same-restaurant sales would be down. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected a decline of 1.1 percent. Shares of McDonald’s, which had fallen earlier in the week, slipped 3 cents to $94.60 in premarket trading. McDonald’s expected sales and profit growth to be under pressure in the near term, as diners spend cautiously due to lackluster economic growth in most major markets. At the same time, the leading fast food chain is comparing against strong results from a year ago, including a 6.7 percent gain in same-restaurant sales in January 2012. February comparable sales will be hit by about 3 percentage points because the 2012 period included an extra day due to the leap year, McDonald’s said. In February 2012, the sales rose 7.5 percent. Comparable sales in Europe, McDonald’s top market, declined 2.1 percent last month, with weakness in Germany and France. Analysts expected an increase of almost 0.1 percent. The United States, a close No. 2, posted a 0.9 percent gain, helped in part by the addition of the Grilled Onion Cheddar burger to its Dollar Menu. U.S. results exceeded analysts’ target for a 0.3 percent decline. Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) turned in a 9.5 percent decline, despite strength in Australia - steeper than the 5.8 percent analysts had anticipated. McDonald’s cited continued weakness in Japan and the shift in the timing of the Chinese New Year.

276,MCD,McDonald's boosts franchises to expand in Russia,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) is widening its franchise operations in Russia to drive expansion deeper into provincial areas as rival international restaurant chains flock to the growing market. The fast-food chain, which has run its own outlets since launching in Russia in 1990, is lining up more partners after last year picking Russia’s largest restaurant holding company Rosinter (ROST.MM) as its first franchisee. “Beyond the Urals, we are interested in Western and Eastern Siberia, and we are also considering franchising out restaurants in (Russia’s western) enclave of Kaliningrad,” Russia CEO Khamzat Khasbulatov told a news conference. He said franchises would be used mainly in areas where it was economically less attractive for self-operated restaurants. Rosinter will open its first restaurants in Moscow and St Petersburg before year-end. McDonald’s, the world’s biggest restaurant company by revenue, also plans to open at least 150 self-operated restaurants in Russia over the next three years. “We will keep the pace of growth we have been showing so far,” said Khasbulatov. McDonald’s has 357 restaurants in more than 85 Russian cities, of which 46 were opened last year. McDonald’s was the first international fast-food chain to tap the Russian market when it opened at Moscow’s Pushkin Square before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The branch had the highest sales and served the most customers of any McDonald’s outlet last year. U.S. Rival Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N), owner of the KFC brand, said this month it planned to open up to 70 restaurants in Russia and other former Soviet countries this year and was looking for new franchise partners to help drive growth.

Global sales at McDonald’s restaurants open at least 13 months fell 1.5 percent in February, slightly less than analysts’ average estimate for a 1.63 percent decline, according to Consensus Metrix. The results come as polls show that low- and middle-income Americans cut back on restaurant meals and other discretionary purchases after higher taxes and rising gasoline costs pinched their wallets. At the same time, McDonald’s has been grappling with the difficult chore of topping a long run of strong monthly sales results - a challenge that should soon abate. In 2012, McDonald’s had same-restaurant sales gains of 6.7 percent in January, 7.5 percent in February and 7.7 percent in March. That eased to just 3.3 percent in April last year. “We have one more tough month.

The company had doubled down on value and is putting more emphasis on new food and limited-time offers as frugal diners shop around for variety and price. Shares of the world’s biggest hamburger chain were up 1.7 percent at $98.71 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon, touching their highest levels since April and approaching their all-time high of just over $100 in January 2012. Excluding the impact of an extra day in February 2012 due to the leap year, comparable sales were up 1.7 percent globally and rose everywhere except the United States, where sales were flat. Investors paid extra attention to results from the United States, because the January 1 payroll tax hike, higher gas prices and delayed federal tax returns have hurt sales at restaurant chains and retailers ranging from Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc (DRI.N) to Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N). McDonald’s did not cite those pressures as having an impact on its U.S. same-restaurant sales, which fell 3.3 percent in February, slightly less than analysts expected. “I’m sure it didn’t help,” said Russo, who added that unseasonably warm winter weather also bolstered last year’s results. McDonald’s reputation for selling low-priced food likely helped the company attract U.S. diners who were trading down from more expensive chains, Russo said. The company historically has been less sensitive to gas price spikes because diners often do not have to drive far to visit one of its more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants. McDonald’s said value-priced food, the Grilled Onion Cheddar burger, the Hot ‘n Spicy McChicken sandwich and a limited-time Fish McBites offer supported U.S. results in February.

285,MCD,McDonald's catches up with rivals with egg-white McMuffin,"* Touts new item as lower-calorie alternative * Egg-white options already offered by rivals LOS ANGELES, March 14 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp  will debut a new egg-white McMuffin in the United States in April and allow diners to swap out egg whites on all of its breakfast sandwiches, catching up with rivals already offering the lower-calorie option. Dubbed the “Egg White Delight,” the new McMuffin will be available nationwide on April 22, the world’s biggest restaurant chain said on Thursday. Though McDonald’s dominates the fast-food breakfast category, competitors such as Dunkin’ Donuts, Subway and Starbucks Corp have offered egg whites - lower in fat and cholesterol than whole eggs - as a breakfast sandwich choice for years. The Egg White Delight packs an energy punch of 250 calories, against 300 calories for McDonald’s mainstay Egg McMuffin. Tested in the Atlanta and Austin markets last year, the new breakfast sandwich also includes Canadian bacon and white cheddar cheese in a whole grain English muffin. The announcement comes as resurgent rivals have made some gains against McDonald’s by introducing more food choices. “It’s a great move. It will broaden (McDonald’s) audience,” particularly diners conscious of cholesterol and fat content, said Bob Goldin, an executive vice president at food service consulting firm Technomic. New Chief Executive Don Thompson, under pressure to revive McDonald’s softening U.S. restaurant sales, said at an investor conference on Wednesday that the company would also introduce new breakfast, chicken, fish, beef and beverage options this year. McDonald’s declined to say how the new McMuffin would be priced. At a McDonald’s in New York City’s Times Square, the regular McMuffin was priced at $3.09 before tax. The chain has had hits recently with more health-oriented food such as fruit smoothies. Still, its “healthy” McLean Deluxe hamburger flopped in the early 1990s and the company recently said it would drop its Fruit & Walnut Salad to make way for other items on its menus.",3142013,http://www.reuters.com/article/mcdonalds-mcmuffin/mcdonalds-catches-up-with-rivals-with-egg-white-mcmuffin-idUSL1N0C62KF20130314
286,MCD,Lawsuit says two-year-old boy ate used condom at Chicago McDonald's,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp has been sued by a woman who said her two-year-old son ate a used condom he found in the play area of one of its restaurants in Chicago. Anishi Spencer filed the complaint against the fast-food restaurant chain on Wednesday in Cook County Circuit Court on behalf of herself and her sons, Jonathan Hines and Jacquel Hines. According to the complaint, Spencer and her sons were at a McDonald’s restaurant in Chicago’s South Side on February 4, 2012 when Jacquel picked up the used condom from the floor, and shortly thereafter coughed up a piece of it. Both boys required medical care, and have suffered lasting injuries, pain and discomfort, the complaint said. Spencer accused McDonald’s of negligence for failing to clean hazardous debris from the play area, and failing to use appropriate security measures to help uncover “deviant activities.” The lawsuit seeks at least $50,000 of damages. “This is a very disgusting case,” Jeffrey Deutschman, a lawyer for Spencer and her sons at Deutschman & Associates in Chicago, said in a phone interview. He said he tried to settle, but was unable to do so after having to deal with “layers and layers” of bureaucracy at McDonald’s, which is based in Oak Brook, Illinois.

288,MCD,Ethical economy: In favor of the living wage,"LONDON, April 10 (Reuters) - In the United States and some other developed economies, wages for the least well paid are too low. A mandatory living wage is the best way to redress this injustice. The idea of minimum wages is well accepted, but the American $7.25 an hour does not meet the simple standard of providing enough to support the worker who earns it. For an adult in New York State, self-support requires 55 percent more, $11.25 an hour in a full-time job, according to The MIT Living Wage Calculator (livingwage.mit.edu/). And a just minimum should really be enough to raise a family - something closer to the $23.58 an hour required to support a single wage-earner with one child. The minimum wage is one part of the remarkably complex pay system found in all developed industrial societies. Economists often suggest that wages are determined by market forces, the supply and demand for labor, and by employers’ calculations of the value of labor. But actual wages influence both the market and the perceived value of labor. It is more accurate to include market forces and economic value somewhere in the middle of the long list of factors which contribute to the ever-shifting social agreement on pay levels. This agreement is established in the mysterious way that all social orders are built - the powerful push, the weak resist, traditions are followwages usa ed and evolve, justice is respected and flouted, market forces and economic calculations nudge. By far the most important factor in determining pay is the social judgment of value. The main reason that bankers, advertising executives and doctors are paid more than teachers, childcare workers and street cleaners is that society values the former more than the latter. And the main reason that the minimum-wage jobs pay too little to support a family is that society has agreed that is what such labor is worth. This is an injustice, because honest labor should always be rewarded with enough to live a decent life. To be fair, the social judgment of these occupations is less harsh than the pay level suggests. The very poorly paid usually receive welfare benefits from the government, either in cash or in the form of free or cut-price services. It is an awkward arrangement, but unavoidable in societies which have decided that pay should be determined by the job but spending power should be determined, at least in part, by needs and family situation. That division will exist as long as family breadwinners do not receive special pay status. Still, the combination of low pay with additional benefits subtracts from the dignity of work. The worker deserves his or her reward, and the right reward is a living wage. Besides, in the current arrangement the low paid often find that playing the benefits system pays better than hard work, to the detriment of both demoralized workers and overburdened taxpayers. It would be better to rely more on pay and less on transfers. That should be possible. After all, the United States and other developed countries produce enough goods and services and have enough infrastructure for every man, woman and child to enjoy not merely life’s necessities but a generous share of its comforts and luxuries as well. With sufficient wisdom, the pay system could be arranged to share out that abundance fairly without much help from the benefit system. The beginning of this social wisdom is higher pay at the bottom of the social scale. Of course, a sudden massive increase in the minimum wage would be counterproductive. Too many employers would be unable or unwilling to pay, so jobs would be lost or moved into the unregulated black market. However, history supports the case for steady and ultimately substantial increases in the minimum wage. When the less well off have more, they spend more, adding to economic activity and reducing the need to extract taxes from the better off. Besides, better remunerated workers have more motivation to work while their employers have more motivation to increase the productivity of this more expensive labor. The macroeconomic objections to higher minimum wages deserve serious attention, but they often hide higher earners’ justified fear of losing out. After all, when those at the bottom end up with more - as they inevitably would with a higher minimum wage, even after benefit cuts - those at the top must end up with less. Doctors would still have much higher incomes than cleaners, but both the doctors’ own pay and the ratio of their pay to cleaners’ remuneration would fall. The desire to maintain consumption and social status is legitimate, but must be set against a higher virtue - solidarity. The fruits of economic success should be shared equitably. A living wage for all is a good standard of success. (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

289,MCD,Texas to execute killer of 17-year-old youth,"AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A Texas man convicted of shooting a 17-year-old youth outside a nightclub in 2001 is due to be executed for murder on Tuesday, in what would be the third lethal injection in the state this year. Dexter McDonald had just left a club in Navarro County, south of Dallas, on April 14, 2001, and was sitting in the back seat of a car when authorities say Ronnie Threadgill ran up and shot him with a handgun. According to the state attorney general’s account, Threadgill got into the car and drove off. He then stopped and pulled McDonald out and left him on the ground before driving away. McDonald died later at a hospital. Threadgill, now 40, was convicted of capital murder in 2002 and is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection in Huntsville, Texas.

291,MCD,McDonald's sees no restaurant rebound in April,"(Reuters) - Almost a year after taking over at McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), Chief Executive Don Thompson is still looking for the right recipe to expand restaurant sales, which are being pinched by the weak global economy and stronger competition from revived rivals. The world’s biggest fast-food chain on Friday dashed hopes that its restaurant sales would accelerate this spring, warning that global sales at established restaurants would be slightly lower in April. The forecast sent McDonald’s shares down 1.4 percent to $100.46 in midday trading. A week ago, the shares hit a record high above $103 on expectations that results would improve in the second half of 2013, when the chain would no longer be up against year-earlier U.S. results that were bolstered by unseasonably warm winter weather. When Thompson took the top job at McDonald’s in July, the chain had been on a long winning streak and had a big lead over rivals. That faltered when global economic weakness and intensified pressure from formerly weak but more nimble chains such as Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N, Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and Yum Brands Inc’s (YUM.N) Taco Bell caused its global-same restaurant sales to weaken. McDonald’s results were expected to improve in April because the company would only have to top 3.3 percent growth in global restaurant sales in April 2012. By comparison, sales were up a whopping 7.7 percent in March 2012. Thompson also had increased low-cost offerings worldwide and has plans for new menu items in the United States, where it recently rolled out new wrap sandwiches. The McDonald’s forecast for April “does put a little bit of a damper on the theory that as soon as comparisons got easier, comps were going to take off,” Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said. While investors and analysts are giving Thompson and his management team time to revive restaurant sales, they could get impatient as the year wears on. “There will be some pressure on the guys to pick up the pace,” Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said. In addition, McDonald’s reported a first-quarter profit that fell short of Wall Street expectations as global comparable sales fell 1 percent - slightly less than the 1.1 percent decline forecast by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix. Net income inched up 0.3 percent to $1.27 billion, or $1.26 per share. Analysts, on average, were looking for $1.27 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. First-quarter revenue rose 0.9 percent to nearly $6.61 billion, higher than the $6.59 billion estimated by analysts. The “challenging” global environment and profit pressures are expected to persist, Thompson said in a statement. Cautious spending is not limited to the United States. McDonald’s Japan plans to introduce a new “Value Pick” line starting on May 7, including the value-priced McDouble sandwich. It also is revising prices - cutting the price of its small french fries but raising the prices of its hamburgers and cheeseburgers.

296,MCD,RPT-McDonald's fined in Brazil for pushing Happy Meals to children,"(Repeats for wider subscribers) By Brad Haynes SAO PAULO, April 22 (Reuters) - A consumer protection agency in Brazil has taken aim at the Happy Meal, fining McDonald’s Corp on Monday for targeting children with its advertising and toys. The Procon agency in the state of Sao Paulo fined the fast-food company 3.2 million reais ($1.6 million), adding fuel to a global debate about fast food and public health. As with the case in Brazil, Latin America’s biggest economy, much of the debate centers on how McDonald’s and other fast-food companies market to children and other young consumers. While the initial fine may have little impact on the world’s largest restaurant chain, the agency said additional citations for similar advertising could arise, more than doubling the cost to McDonald’s. Consumer agencies in other jurisdictions could also soon follow the precedent in Brazil’s most populous state. “This is not an isolated case,” said Procon’s top lawyer in Sao Paulo, Renan Ferraciolli. “There’s no need to appeal as they do to children without the maturity or the rationality to enter the market as consumers.” The fine, announced on Monday, stemmed from a 2010 campaign offering meals with toys from the motion picture Avatar and a local television series, Ferraciolli said. Other marketing activity since then has followed similar patterns, he added, giving the agency grounds to consider additional fines. A spokeswoman for McDonald’s declined to comment on the case. The company can appeal Procon’s ruling in court. In the United States, pediatricians have urged a ban on advertising unhealthy foods to children, but legal measures have gained little traction. A judge there last year threw out a lawsuit against Happy Meal marketing. U.S. regulators have urged companies to voluntarily end food advertising to children unless they are promoting healthy fare, but industry groups have fought fiercely against such proposals. In a nod to concerns from public health advocates, McDonald’s in recent years added apples and reduced the amount of french fries in its children’s Happy Meals, which continue to include a free toy. The chain also moved to start listing calorie information on menus throughout the United States ahead of a national rule requiring such disclosures.

299,MCD,"McDonald's, Wendy's dig in on deals in battle for diners","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and other U.S. restaurants are battling for the attention of frugal diners with coupons, limited time offers and other promotions - a fight that could intensify if the costs of chicken and other key ingredients remain less pricey than feared. While prices for beef and other items are up due to last summer’s historic drought, overall food costs remain relatively muted, giving restaurant operators “more ammunition to play the promotional and value game if they want to,” said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo. Fast-food chains in the United States and other countries around the globe are struggling to increase traffic and sales as persistent economic weakness has taken a big toll on the low- and middle-income diners who are their chief customers. McDonald’s on Wednesday reported an unexpected 0.7 percent rise in April sales at established U.S. restaurants, helped by the national release of premium McWraps with discounted introductory prices, value food options and continued strength in breakfast items. Still, the world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue is struggling to meaningfully boost sales after a long run of outperforming smaller rivals, which of late have been more nimble in introducing attention-getting menu items. McDonald’s has vowed to roll out more limited-time offers and other deals, along with more new food. And, it has said it is willing to sacrifice some profitability to win market share. First-quarter sales at established Wendy’s North America restaurants also were up, but less than analysts expected, and its shares fell over five percent. Executives at the chain known for its square, fresh beef hamburger patties and thick Frosty shakes, said it lost ground in the low-priced food fight - something it plans to fight with marketing and advertising for food priced around 99 cents. “We have been growing large hamburger, large chicken sandwich and salad sales, but losing share for value menu customers,” Wendy’s Chief Executive Emil Brolick said on a conference call with analysts. The 99-cent price shoppers are heavy fast-food users “and you need to continually remind them that you have products available for them every day,” Brolick said. Elsewhere, Yum Brands Inc’s (YUM.N) Taco Bell - long known for being a purveyor of very inexpensive food - is testing a “$1 Cravings” menu that may go national. It is also advertising $1 “Happier Hour” offers from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. And, the battle for cash-strapped customers is not limited to the United States. Canada-based Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO, which has consistently delivered strong results, on Wednesday said same-store sales in the United States fell 0.5 percent in the first quarter, while sales in Canada slipped 0.3 percent. April softness in McDonald’s Europe, Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa regions more than offset the better-than-expected U.S. growth in sales at restaurants open at least 13 months. McDonald’s April same-restaurant sales fell 2.4 percent in Europe - where austerity measures and other financial woes have dampened demand - and 2.9 percent in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region - where sales of menu items with chicken have been hurt by an outbreak of bird flu.

300,MCD,McDonalds India may hike prices amid rising inflation,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - An Indian franchise operator of McDonalds Corp (MCD.N) may increase prices for the second time this year, responding to rising inflation which, along with an economic slowdown, it expects to temper demand growth for at least the next 7 months. The company, Hardcastle Restaurants, said on Tuesday it could raise prices by 5-6 percent. That follows a 5 percent hike after the government increased the service tax rate in February. “There is pressure and it’s a tough environment, no doubt. But inflation is at 8-10 percent so we have to hike our prices,” said Amit Jatia, vice-chairman of Hardcastle Restaurants, which owns the McDonalds franchise for west and south India. He said, however, that the company had no intention for now to raise prices. Consumer spending in India has taken a hit in the past three quarters as rising food prices, meager salary increases and the slowest Indian economic growth in a decade hurt buying appetites for clothes, cars and eating out. With its 1.2 billion people and growing middle class, India is a large market for global chains, though for now most Indians cannot afford to eat regularly in western-style restaurants. The burger chain said its same-store sales remained under pressure and although they would grow, the increase would not be at the 22 percent achieved in the fiscal year ended March 2012. McDonalds entered India in 1996 without its signature hamburger, respecting local religious beliefs which mean many people avoid eating beef and pork. It has become India’s largest fast food chain operator selling chicken and fish burgers along with vegetarian items like McAloo Tikki, which has a potato patty, and the McSpicy Paneer, filled with cottage cheese. The burger chain plans capital spending of 5 billion-10 billion rupees ($92 million-$184 million) in India over the next 3-5 years, mostly for store expansion, Jatia said, adding India’s long-term consumption growth story remained intact. McDonalds has 309 stores in the country. The company plans to add 80-90 restaurants in western and southern India in the next two years. Hardcastle is also contemplating an equity fund raising to fuel McDonalds’ expansion in the country in the coming years. “We are in talks with merchant bankers every day and are open to it. But we are considering all our options and that includes debt also. We will be clear with our decision on what instrument we choose in a month,” Jatia said. In December, Hardcastle Restaurants merged its operations with listed parent Westlife Development Ltd (WEST.BO) (The story corrects to make clear the entity is the local franchise operator; adds to show that the company has no immediate plan for a price increase; changes headline accordingly) ",5082013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-india/mcdonalds-india-may-hike-prices-amid-rising-inflation-idUSBRE9470HW20130508

302,MCD,McDonald's cuts Angus burgers from U.S. menu due to high beef prices,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) said on Thursday it is phasing out one-third pound Angus burgers from U.S. menus, an anticipated move that comes shortly after U.S. beef prices hit a 10-year high. The company in March said it was weighing the removal of its “premium” Angus burgers to make room for other food options. “While these burgers will no longer be available in our restaurants, they may still play a future role on our menu,” spokeswoman Danya Proud said. While prices for beef and other commodities have risen as a result of last summer’s historic drought, overall food costs have not seen the sharp spike experts predicted. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) wholesale beef market report on Thursday morning showed choice beef carcasses rising 24 cents per hundred pounds (cwt) to a record $204.91 per cwt above the previous record of $204.67 hit late on Wednesday. McDonald’s and other chains have worked to offset higher beef costs by promoting chicken, which is less expensive than beef. To that end, McDonald’s recently introduced premium chicken wraps. The world’s biggest hamburger chain introduced Angus burgers in 2009. It has been revamping its menu amid tough competition from revived rivals such as Burger King BKW.N and Wendy’s Co (WEN.O). In March, McDonald’s announced it was cutting Fruit & Walnut Salad and Chicken Selects from menus at its more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants.

303,MCD,"Fast-food workers in Detroit walk off job, disrupt business","(Reuters) - Hundreds of fast-food employees in Detroit walked off the job on Friday, temporarily shuttering a handful of outlets as part of a growing U.S. worker movement that is demanding higher wages for flipping burgers and operating fryers. The protests in the Motor City - which is struggling to recover from the hollowing out of its auto manufacturing sector - marked an expansion in organized actions by fast-food workers from ubiquitous chains owned by McDonald’s Corp, Burger King Worldwide and KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut parent Yum Brands Inc. Fast-food workers, who already have taken to the streets in New York, Chicago and St. Louis, are seeking to roughly double their hourly pay to $15 per hour from around minimum wage, which in Michigan is $7.40 per hour. Organizers said more than 400 people turned out for the Detroit event, the most to date. They also said the walk-outs forced the temporary closures of two McDonald’s restaurants, a Burger King, a Subway, a Long John Silver’s and a Popeyes in Detroit - a claim some chains disputed. Outside a Burger King on 8 Mile in Detroit, employee Claudette Wilson said she’s tired of poor wages, especially at a time when the fast-food industry continues to grow. “I make minimum wage, which is what I made when I started working in fast food three years ago,” the 20-year-old college student said. “I can’t understand how the industry is growing but our wages aren’t.” Organizers said the Detroit metro area has 53,000 fast-food jobs, which pay at or just above minimum wage. The fast-food workforce is twice as large as that of the region’s famed auto manufacturing sector and is projected to grow faster than the region’s overall workforce in the coming years, organizers said. “People can’t make a living at $7.40 a hour,” said Rev. Charles Williams II, a protest organizer. “Many of them have babies and children to raise, and they can’t get by with these kind of wages.” Those workers face high hurdles in their fight for better pay. Low-wage, low-skill workers lack political clout and face significantly higher unemployment than college graduates. U.S. President Barack Obama proposed raising the federal minimum wage in his State of the Union address as a way to help lift some workers out of poverty. But critics of such a move, including representatives for the nearly $200 billion U.S. fast-food industry, say it would kill jobs by burdening small businesses with higher costs. At a Long John Silver’s on Detroit’s east side, a lone manager tended the restaurant as the presence of protesters appeared to stifle business. A McDonald’s spokeswoman told Reuters its Michigan restaurants were “open, and operating as usual”. Burger King said none of its restaurants were shut down and no workers walked off the job. Representatives from Subway, Long John Silver’s and AFC Enterprises’ Popeyes did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Margaret Neal, 52, said frustration with the low wage she earns after more than a decade working at a McDonald’s in Detroit prompted her to join Friday’s protests. Asked about her pay, Neal said: “You don’t even want to know, I’ve been there 15 years. I’m still making $8.83 (an hour). That’s not right.” Neal, who works full-time, says her bosses have told her she is “maxed out” at her current wage and ineligible for an increase. The vast majority of McDonald’s more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants are owned and operated by franchisees. The company said in a statement that McDonald’s employees are paid competitive wages, have access to a range of benefits and opportunities for training and career advancement. The Detroit action was put together by the Michigan Workers Organizing Committee, an independent union of fast-food workers, that is supported by community, labor and faith-based groups such as the Interfaith Coalition of Pastors, UFCW Local 876, SEIU Healthcare Michigan and Good Jobs Now.

Lafley is taking on the roles of chairman, president and chief executive officer, effective immediately, while McDonald is set to retire on June 30 after 33 years at P&G.; The move comes as some investors have pushed for faster improvements from the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors. P&G; unveiled a $10 billion restructuring program in February 2012. Since then, it has cut thousands of jobs and taken other steps to speed up its operations, improve its success with new products and do a better job in both fast-growing emerging markets and in larger, developed markets such as the United States. “Bob retired, the board called me and I felt like duty called. I’m back to help maintain the business momentum and keep this productivity program going,” Lafley told Reuters. Lafley said that, while he could not give one reason for McDonald’s retirement, “I think it’s a number of personal reasons.” McDonald was not made available for an interview. Lafley, who will celebrate his 66th birthday in June, said P&G;’s board asked him days, not weeks, ago to come back, but he did not say exactly when he got the call.

312,MCD,Analysis: P&G; all-star board's oversight questioned as CEO departs,"(Reuters) - The sudden exit of Procter & Gamble Co’s (PG.N) Bob McDonald as chief executive and the return of former CEO A.G. Lafley in his place has raised questions about the vigilance of one of America’s highest-profile corporate boards. On paper at least, P&G;, the maker of a myriad of household products such as Crest toothpaste and Tide detergent, has one of the strongest boards in the world with CEOs from six other companies among its 12 members, including three from companies in the Dow Jones industrial average. The CEOs include Boeing Co’s (BA.N) James McNerney, Hewlett-Packard Co’s (HPQ.N) Meg Whitman, American Express Co (AXP.N) CEO Kenneth Chenault, and Macy’s Inc CEO (M.N) Terry Lundgren. P&G; in its annual proxy statement to shareholders last year described the board as “highly qualified and each Director brings a diversity of skills and experiences.” It said all of the directors - who also include Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) CEO Patricia Woertz, Frontier Communications Corp (FTR.O) CEO Maggie Wilderotter and former Mexico President Ernesto Zedillo - qualify as possessing “extraordinary leadership qualities and are able to identify and develop leadership qualities in others.” But some investors and corporate governance experts say that having so many powerful directors could also be a weakness because serving CEOs are under a lot of pressure in their own jobs and therefore cannot commit much time to being a director of another company. They also suggest that major P&G; investors, such as Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N)(which had a P&G; stake of about 2 percent at the end of March), and activist hedge fund investor Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management (with around 1 percent), would also have more at stake than the CEOs, who only have modest P&G; shareholdings. While boards in corporate America are often dominated by current and retired executives, many also have investors represented - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), for example, has Buffett’s son Howard Buffett on its board (Berkshire has a 9 percent stake). The lack of big investors on the board is a concern, said Frank Feather, chairman of Toronto-based corporate strategy consulting company Geodevco. There should be some directors who own significant amounts of shares that were not paid for or issued to them by the company. “Directors should have skin in the game,” he said. Added Urmi Ashar, who founded the Pittsburgh chapter of the National Association of Corporate Directors and teaches governance at Carnegie Mellon University: “The heavyweight board of P&G; packed with CEOs is a definite red flag and it leaves one wondering how much time they have to dedicate to the challenges at P&G.;” Whitman, for example, has been trying to engineer a turnaround at HP, following a failed acquisition by her predecessor and amid a struggling personal computer market. Meanwhile, McNerney has faced a crisis at Boeing after overheating batteries grounded its new Dreamliner aircraft since January, with flights only now resuming. Still, their attendance record - and that of other directors - for P&G; board meetings last year was strong. And several of the CEOs, including Whitman and Lundgren, weren’t on the board when McDonald was appointed in June 2009. Also giving a CEO a reasonable period - just under four years in McDonald’s case - to produce results would be pretty standard at most major companies unless the share price was imploding. All the board members contacted for this article either declined to comment or were not available, including McNerney, who holds the title of presiding director at P&G.; The presiding director, among other things, oversees director meetings when management is not present. A P&G; spokesman declined to comment. Even Ackman, who had been pushing for McDonald to be replaced, in October described the board as “one of the best” in America. He declined to comment for this article. It is still unclear what finally triggered McDonald’s retirement, which was announced late last Thursday, and P&G; has declined to answer questions. The company disappointed investors last month when it said that earnings in the current quarter would be lower than Wall Street expected but on Friday P&G; Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told analysts on a brief call that the CEO change would not lead to a strategy change and was “not indicative of any kind of bigger problem or financial issue. Still, its share price did underperform between the time McDonald was appointed in June 2009 and the announcement of his departure. Its shares have risen about 50 percent in that time but that is less than the gains achieved by major consumer products rivals over the same span: Unilever Plc's (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) shares are up 85-93 percent depending on which listing is cited, Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) up 74 percent and Clorox Co (CLX.N) gained 60 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX advanced 75 percent in that period. The debate over the suitability of outside CEOs for boards dates back decades, but reviews on their effectiveness are mixed. A 2011 review of research by Stanford University academics found that while in theory CEOs should bring the leadership qualities and expertise that boards need, no research had found they are in fact better board members. Some investors also questioned why the P&G; board had to turn to a retired CEO to return to the helm, and didn’t have a more robust CEO succession policy in place. Bringing back Lafley “highlights poor succession planning by the board,” said Jason Tauber, a research analyst with the Large Cap Disciplined Growth team at Neuberger Berman, which holds 8.7 million P&G; shares. One of the problems was that a previously deep bench in management ranks at P&G; has been depleted since McDonald became CEO in 2009. When a new CEO takes over, some departures of other top executives are often inevitable as they go elsewhere to fulfill their ambitions of running a company but in P&G;’s case the losses were perhaps more significant. They included razor business leader Chip Bergh, who left to take over Levi Strauss & Co LEVST.UL in 2011, and vice chairman Ed Shirley, who became CEO at Bacardi Ltd BACLTD.UL in 2012. When he announced McDonald had been named to the top job in 2009, McNerney described him as “the most broadly and globally experienced CEO in P&G; history” and said he got the position after “a rigorous, disciplined and multi-year succession process led by the Board.” The decision to bring back Lafley was applauded by investors who pushed P&G;’s share price up 4 percent on Friday, though they slipped back slightly on Tuesday to close at $80.86. The stock rose initially because Lafley was seen as a known quantity, investors said. However, some of the company’s current problems started to come to light towards the end of his time as CEO, some analysts said. Lafley left P&G; with a bloated organization after leading several acquisitions, most notably the $57 billion purchase of Gillette in 2005, and P&G; also was widely seen as slow in expanding in fast-growing emerging markets and introducing products to appeal to more frugal consumers in developed markets. Ashar said it was striking P&G; would turn back to Lafley, the architect of many past successes but also a force behind McDonald’s installation. “What it tells me is that the current ‘All Star’ board of P&G; really has delegated the responsibility of sense-making back to Lafley.” ",5292013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-proctergamble-ceo-board-analysis/analysis-pg-all-star-boards-oversight-questioned-as-ceo-departs-idUSBRE94S05U20130529

Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected a 1.9 percent rise in global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months. McDonald’s shares rose 2 percent to $100.50 in premarket trading on Monday.

The overall global result was better compared with April, when same-restaurant sales slipped 0.6 percent.

316,MCD,"UPDATE 3-Ex-Microsoft executive, ex-McDonald's CEO join HP board","By Poornima Gupta and Sinead Carew SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK, July 15 (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co on Monday appointed three big-name directors, including former Microsoft Corp software chief Raymond Ozzie and former McDonald’s Corp Chief Executive James Skinner, as the struggling PC maker searches for a chairman and addresses top-level stumbles of past years. The PC maker, which has been trying to strengthen its board after years of leadership calamities, also named Robert Bennett, former CEO of Liberty Media Corp and said it will continue searching for more directors. It is also looking for a permanent nonexecutive chairman to succeed Ralph Whitworth, who holds the position on an interim basis. Monday’s appointments increase the size of HP’s board to 12 from nine. Chief Executive Officer Meg Whitman is trying to turn around HP’s operations, while Whitworth, who heads activist hedge fund Relational Investors, promised board changes when he took the job in April. Previous Chairman Ray Lane resigned as the chairman after he came under fire from shareholders for his role in HP’s disastrous acquisition of British software company Autonomy Plc. Lane remains a director at HP. HP’s leadership has been in tumult since the 2010 departure of CEO Mark Hurd over sexual harassment allegations, which he has denied. Current CEO Whitman took the top job in September 2011 after predecessor Leo Apotheker’s brief stint, which was marked by slashed earnings forecasts and a plunge in the company’s share price. Lane also overhauled the board in early 2011, months after he joined. In 2012, HP had to take a multibillion-dollar writedown for its takeover of Autonomy, enraging investors. The deal capped a tumultuous decade for the company that included the 2006 “pretexting” scandal, which led to the resignation of then-Chairwoman Patricia Dunn. Monday’s appointment of well-known directors to HP’s board appeared to be an effort to answer shareholders’ longstanding cries for a stronger board. OZZIE’S POST-PC WORLD VISION Ozzie, the software guru whom Microsoft founder Bill Gates designated as the company’s big-picture thinker, left the company in 2010 to start Talko Inc, which focuses on mobile communications applications and services. When departing from Microsoft, Ozzie urged Microsoft to move on from its Windows and Office roots and imagine a “post-PC world” of simple, global Web devices. The addition of the author of the now famous “Internet Services Disruption” memo which he evangelized now-common cloud computing — and which he wrote shortly after joining Microsoft in 2005 — comes as HP is trying to adjust to shrinking PC sales. China’s Lenovo Group Ltd overtook HP as the world’s top PC maker in the latest quarter. Skinner was credited with turning around McDonald’s during his time as CEO from November 2004 until 2012 and that company’s share price tripled during his tenure. He is also chairman of drugstore chain Walgreen Co. Bennett will join the finance and investment committee and its audit committee. Ozzie will join the technology committee and the finance and investment committee. Skinner will join committees governing audit, human resources and compensation, and governance. HP shares were up 20 cents at $26.39 on the New York Stock Exchange.",7152013,http://www.reuters.com/article/hp-board/update-3-ex-microsoft-executive-ex-mcdonalds-ceo-join-hp-board-idUSL1N0FL09320130715
317,MCD,"McDonald's signals weak 2013 as U.S. rivals, Europe economy bite","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) on Monday dashed investor hopes that its business would strengthen in the second half of the year, blaming tougher competition in the U.S. and weaker sales in Europe. The world’s biggest restaurant chain by sales reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and said it expects global same-restaurant sales in July to be relatively flat, sending its shares down almost 3 percent in midday trading. “Based on recent sales trends, our results for the remainder of the year are expected to remain challenged,” Chief Executive Don Thompson said in a statement. Wall Street analysts had expected McDonald’s business to pick up in the middle of this year as food inflation and other pressures ease. “I would have liked to have seen them be a little more positive on things,” Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said. The latest quarterly results from the seller of Big Mac hamburgers, french fries and Happy Meals heaps pressure on Thompson, who was promoted to the CEO position in July 2012, when the chain was enjoying a multi-year run of rising sales and profits. Still, Russo said Wall Street would likely give the well-regarded McDonald’s CEO a pass for a bit longer: “I don’t see an operator in the United States or Europe really tearing it up.” Graphic on McDonald's results: link.reuters.com/xut79t In the second quarter ended June 30, global sales at McDonald’s restaurants open at least 12 months rose 1 percent, in line with analysts’ expectations. McDonald’s said second-quarter same-restaurant sales in the United States were up 1 percent, missing the average analysts’ forecast of a 1.5 percent increase. The company is fighting to boost sales as smaller U.S. rivals such as Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N debut attention-grabbing food, like bacon sundaes and limited-time offers. Shares of McDonald’s were trading at down 2.8 percent at $97.45, while stock in Wendy’s was up 1.1 percent at $6.76. Wendy’s, known for its thick Frosty shakes and square hamburgers, recently launched a Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger that appears to be chain’s best-selling new product in at least a decade. “This pressure on McDonald’s could last over the third quarter as a whole, and perhaps beyond, if Wendy’s adds its Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger as a permanent menu item - which looks increasingly likely,” Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski said. McDonald’s, which still dominates the fast-food industry, has been offering late-night breakfasts, tweaking other menus and advertising value-priced meals to bring in more traffic. The chain said its indulgent new line of Quarter Pounder hamburgers - including a bacon habanero ranch version - have performed well. It recently axed lackluster sellers like premium Angus burgers and its Fruit & Walnut Salad while also catching up with rivals by introducing an egg white version of its popular McMuffin breakfast sandwich. In Europe, same-restaurant sales were down 0.1 percent in the quarter - the third consecutive quarter of declining sales in the region. In the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region, second-quarter sales fell 0.3 percent. Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had forecast declines of 0.1 percent in Europe and 0.2 percent in APMEA. They expect Wendy’s to report a 1.1 percent gain in second-quarter sales. McDonald’s second-quarter net income rose 3.7 percent to $1.40 billion, but earnings per share of $1.38 missed analysts’ estimate by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Nevertheless, McDonald’s executives said the chain is gaining share in the so-called informal eating out category, which is dominated by fast-food operators. Still, they warned that significant coupon and voucher discounting is keeping them from raising prices to offset higher costs. Bill Smead, a portfolio manager at the Smead Value Fund in Seattle, holds shares in McDonald’s and is betting the iconic and well-run chain will see better days ahead. The company is in a normal down cycle after benefiting when the global recession forced cash-crunched diners to trade down to McDonald’s from pricier chains to save money. It also got a big bump from profit-boosting new drinks like lattes and smoothies, he said. “McDonald’s is an emotional and legal addiction in many cases. You went there, your kids go there, your grandkids go there,” Smead said.

McDonald’s Corp, the world’s largest restaurant chain, reported weaker-than-expected net income and warned that full-year results would be “challenged” in the face of falling sales in Europe, its biggest market. Shares fell 2.6 percent to $97.68, weighing on the blue chip Dow index. McDonald’s earnings came in a busy week of earnings reports, with about one-third of S&P; 500 companies due to report, including Apple and entertainment provider Netflix Inc . The S&P; 500 index on Friday edged up to end at a second straight record high, while the Dow and Nasdaq stock gauges fell as disappointing earnings results from Microsoft  and Google dragged on the market. “McDonald’s (earnings) headlines were a little weak but I think we are still in the strong start of the earnings season,” said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. “We might consolidate here a bit after the rally but we are not entering a correction or anything. The market is shaking off the bad news from Google and Microsoft already,” and that shows the upward momentum is strong, Detrick said. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 12.59 points, or 0.08 percent, at 15,531.15. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was down 0.23 points, or 0.01 percent, at 1,691.86. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 1.09 points, or 0.03 percent, at 3,588.70.

McDonald’s Corp, the world’s largest restaurant chain, reported weaker-than-expected net income and warned that full-year results would be “challenged” in the face of falling sales in Europe, its biggest market. Shares fell 2.9 percent to $97.42 in premarket trade. McDonald’s earnings came in a busy week of reports, with about one-third of S&P; 500 companies due to report, including Apple and entertainment provider Netflix Inc. The S&P; 500 index on Friday edged up to end at a second straight record high, while the Dow and Nasdaq stock gauges fell as disappointing earnings results from Microsoft and Google dragged on the market.

327,MCD,UPDATE 2-Pretzel burger powers Wendy's stock after bold outlook,"By Atossa Araxia Abrahamian July 23 (Reuters) - Buoyed by optimism over its new Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger, shares of Wendy’s Co rose to their highest in more than five years on Tuesday after the company announced the sale of hundreds of restaurants to franchisees and posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit. Wendy’s also offered investors a strong sales and profit outlook, and raised its quarterly dividend by a penny to 5 cents a share. Its shares rose 11 percent in mid-day trade. The sale of 425 company-operated stores to franchisees will  cut costs, analysts say, and the proceeds will reassure investors that the burger chain can finance a long-term image overhaul. By the end of 2014, Wendy’s will own 15 percent of its restaurants, down from 22 percent prior to the sales. On the negative side, system-wide sales at established North American restaurants increased by 0.4 percent, well short of the 1.1 percent gain expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix that quarter. The company said the miss was partly because some restaurants stopped serving breakfast in 2012. Wendy’s expects sales in established outlets to increase by 2 to 3 percent by the end of the year. Analysts at Janney see the Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger introduced this summer as a big driver in the expected gains. Wendy’s new burger is the latest in a string of extravagant innovations at U.S. fast-food restaurants. It is designed to attract younger consumers, who are less inclined to count the burger’s 680 calories than their parents. “We believe this key menu item will lead to some meaningful acceleration in Wendy’s same-store sales that the Street does not currently anticipate,” wrote Janney analysts Mark Kalinowski and Amy Babington. Second-quarter net income came in at $12.2 million, or 3 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $5.5 million, or 1 cent. Revenue rose to $650.5 million from $645.9 million. Excluding debt retirement costs and other one-time expenses, earnings were 8 cents per share, topping analysts’ average forecast by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wendy’s said it expected a long-term growth rate in the mid-teens for adjusted earnings starting in 2014, based on the profitability of its remaining restaurants, a more focused market, and cash from the sales. The restaurants the company is selling off also tend to be locations with lower operating margins in the Western states, said CFO Steve Hare during an investor call. Selling them will allow the company to collect rent and royalties as well as work with about 100 new franchisees on rebranding efforts, the company said. The chain reaffirmed its prior forecast for full-year adjusted profit of 20 cents to 22 cents per share. In topping analysts’ expectations, Wendy’s outshone its main competitor McDonald’s Corp, which reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Monday, and sees little change in same-restaurant sales in July. The McDonald’s slowdown presents a special opportunity for Wendy’s as it prepares to roll out a marketing campaign with a redesigned logo, restaurant renovations and a “Right Price, Right Size” menu. The new, simplified logo retains the image of a smiling, red-headed girl but uses a more modern font for “Wendy’s” and removes the wording “Old Fashioned Hamburgers.” For Wendy’s, the Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger was a well-timed hit, coming as part of a wave of high-calorie menu offerings from the fast-food industry. In June, Dunkin Donuts introduced a Glazed Donut Breakfast Sandwich, which consists of a fried egg with bacon inside a split glazed donut. A Dunkin Donuts spokeswoman said the sandwich is no longer being promoted, but is available upon request. McDonald’s serves a late-night breakfast in some regions. And Burger King Worldwide recently debuted a bacon ice-cream sundae. Wendy’s  has not said whether it intends to keep the seasonal burger on as a permanent menu item. R.J. Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar, said the pretzel-burger may end up a mere flash in the pan. “There’s always something else coming from other competitors” he said. “In the long term, it won’t give anyone a run for their money.”",7232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/wendys-results/update-2-pretzel-burger-powers-wendys-stock-after-bold-outlook-idUSL1N0FT0DC20130723

329,MCD,Fast food workers kick-off multi-city protests for higher pay,"(Reuters) - Hundreds of low-wage workers at fast-food chains such as McDonald’s and Wendy’s on Monday protested in the streets of New York, kick-starting a week of demonstrations in several major cities demanding the right to unionize and pressing for a pay raise to $15 per hour - double the federal minimum wage. Protesters, many who earn less than the $11 per hour threshold many economists consider the cutoff for poverty-level wages, said they had nothing to lose by speaking out against their employers. “Remaining silent is not an option because it’s nearly impossible to survive on $7.25 an hour,” said Kareem Starks, a McDonald’s worker in Brooklyn, referring to the federal minimum wage. Organizers said as many as 500 workers turned out for the New York rallies. But opponents of the campaign, in their highest profile response to the workers yet, put out a full-page ad in USA Today that said catering to those demands would kill jobs. The protesting workers, who are getting support from unions, and community and religious groups, are also planning demonstrations in Chicago, Kansas City, St. Louis, Detroit, Milwaukee and Flint, Michigan, this week. Millions of working families and individuals in the United States struggle to live on pay that is at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25, which when adjusted for inflation, is worth 22 percent less than in 1968 ($9.27) and 7 percent less than in 2009 ($7.78), according to figures provided by the progressive Washington, D.C.-based Economic Policy Institute. U.S. President Barack Obama, state and federal lawmakers, and even some corporate executives have proposed raising the federal minimum wage as a way to help lift some workers out of poverty. The $200 billion U.S. fast-food industry has long opposed a minimum wage increase because labor is one of their largest costs. The Washington, D.C.-based Employment Policies Institute (EPI) ad responding to the workers’ demands said that raising their wages to $15 an hour would hurt restaurant operators and force them to “replace employees with less-costly, automated alternatives like touch-screen ordering and payment devices.” “The dollar menu is going to be the $5 menu and (restaurants) are going to lose sales, or they’re going to have to find a way to provide the same product with less service,” Michael Saltsman, EPI’s research director, told Reuters. Restaurant owners already are testing automated ordering and payments systems to save money. They also work to boost profits by moving workers to part-time from full-time and by assigning very short shifts to cover busy periods. The response from EPI - which is funded by businesses, individuals and foundations and led by Rick Berman, a powerful lobbyist for the tobacco, alcohol, food and beverage industries - comes as protests by low-wage workers in the restaurant and retail industry are growing and attracting more media coverage. McDonald’s did not respond to a request for comment. Devonte Yates, 21, a McDonald’s worker in Milwaukee, makes $7.25 per hour and said he can only get anywhere from nine to 20 hours a week even though he’d like to work more. Yates said he is often on call, which makes it difficult to take a second job. When he does get called to work, there is no guarantee he will get a full, eight-hours. “The shortest shift I’ve ever worked is 90 minutes,” he said, adding that it takes him that long to get to work on the bus, which costs $4.50 per round trip.

333,MCD,FEATURE-Tycoon's 10-year crusade to get a Big Mac in Vietnam,"HO CHI MINH CITY, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Tycoon Henry Nguyen mopped floors, flipped burgers and even cleaned toilets over a 10-year campaign to convince McDonald’s Corp to let him bring Big Macs and Happy Meals to communist Vietnam. McDonald’s is making a late entry into this market, where Yum Brands Inc already has dozens of Pizza Hut and KFC outlets and Burger King Worldwide Inc has 15 restaurants. Even Starbucks Corp debuted in Ho Chi Minh City in February and opened its second branch last week. Capitalism has taken root in a country that many Americans associate more with an unpopular war than rising wealth. The super-rich are becoming household names in Vietnam, which showcased its first billionaire in June on the cover of its inaugural edition of Forbes magazine. Nguyen, a Vietnamese-American who set up Pizza Hut in Vietnam six years ago, says he has lived and breathed McDonald’s. He studied its business model as part of his master’s degree, and pursued the Vietnam franchise opportunity for a decade - even as he worked with rival Yum. When he visited his hometown of Chicago, he would meet McDonald’s executives at the company’s headquarters in suburban Oak Brook, Illinois. The Golden Arches will first appear in Ho Chi Minh City in early 2014 and later in the capital Hanoi, but the expansion will be “step by step”, said Nguyen, who worked at McDonald’s in the United States as a teenager and again this year at a Singapore outlet. His timing looks questionable. While rivals have gained a firm foothold, McDonald’s is opening just as the economy falters and consumer demand is fading. Still, the 40-year-old is convinced the local market is ripe for a McDonald’s franchise. “McDonald’s showing up here shows that Vietnam is a big deal to a lot of people. It means things are happening in Vietnam,” Nguyen told Reuters in an interview at his swanky office here in Vietnam’s most iconic building. He is the son-in-law of Nguyen Tan Dung, Vietnam’s prime minister since 2006, but insists that isn’t why he won the McDonald’s franchise deal. McDonald’s spokeswoman Becca Hary confirmed that Nguyen had been discussing the franchise opportunity for many years, and said he made the shortlist out of a much larger group. “His marriage did not preclude him for participating in what was a very competitive selection process for our partner in Vietnam,” she said, adding that the company’s research into a new market can span years and it saw “great opportunities ahead” in Vietnam. Vietnam recorded 4.9 and 5 percent economic growth, respectively, in the first two quarters of 2013, lacklustre for a developing Asian market, putting it on track for its slowest annual expansion in 14 years. Debt-laden banks are struggling to lend and at least 120,000 businesses have closed since 2011, official data shows. Retail sales growth was 11.8 percent in the first quarter, the slowest since 2005, and 2012’s annual increase of 15.7 percent was just half the rate recorded two years earlier. In advanced markets, McDonald’s tends to do well when the economy weakens because cash-strapped consumers trade down to cheaper food. But in developing economies, Western fast food has cachet and is often priced out of the reach of the masses. In Vietnam, a piece of KFC chicken costs about as much as a bowl of Vietnam’s trademark all-day meal, pho noodle soup, at 32,000 dong ($1.51), and a KFC meal is more than double that. Burger King’s burgers go for as much as 85,000 dong. McDonald’s has not yet opened, so pricing information was not available, but Nguyen said he did not want to position it as a luxury brand. Though this once “tiger” economy might appear to be losing its teeth, Nguyen is adamant McDonald’s hasn’t missed the boat. “McDonald’s doesn’t look at the conditions today, they look at the long-term potential of the market,” he said. “There’s a big market here, a big part because of the demographic.” Other big brands have sussed that out too. Two-thirds of Vietnam’s 90 million population are under the age of 30, its cities are swelling and 34 percent of its people are internet users within easy reach of Western marketeers. It’s not just about the masses. Although average annual income per capita is just $1,400 - one quarter that of Thailand and a seventh of Malaysia’s according to the World Bank - Vietnam has a wealthy, status-conscious urban middle class that enjoys splashing out on big names, expensive smartphones and top of the range Vespa motorcycles. “My family’s business is doing well, so I don’t see any recession,” said Doan Ngoc Nhu, 33, moments after handing over 200 million dong ($9,400) for an Hermes bag at a posh Ho Chi Minh City mall. “I chose this bag because it’s expensive,” added Nhu, sporting a well-cut designer dress. “It means quality, it helps me build an image and I care a lot about my image.” Gucci and Louis Vuitton are now readily available for well-heeled Vietnamese urbanites. Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee chain, sees “tremendous opportunity” in Vietnam, a spokesperson said. As Starbucks is aware, in a country that produces 15 percent of the world’s coffee and has an abnormally high amount of coffee shops, it’s about where, not what people are drinking. “It makes me feel more Western, more dynamic,” said student Tran Thien Thanh, 20, perched on a modern sofa in a Starbucks in the former Saigon thronged with customers web-surfing on iPhones and iPads. ‘SUPER-LUXURY CARS’ Luxury automaker Rolls Royce plans to open its first showroom in Vietnam next year, targeting the entrepreneurs unscathed from the slowdown having earned their riches in the boom years of 2003-2008, when the economy grew an average 7.8 percent annually. “The Rolls Royce customer owns at least $30 million or has five or more super-luxury cars,” said Minh Doan, head of Rolls Royce Motor Cars in Hanoi. “The fundamentals are sound for long term growth and wealth creation for Vietnam’s businesses.” But there’s still plenty of chains and brands that aren’t here and many companies have been put off. Infrastructure is often inadequate, supply chains are limited, import taxes are high. Corruption, cronyism, protectionism and excessive bureaucracy are longstanding problems, as shown in Vietnam’s ranking of 99th out of 185 countries last year in terms of ease of doing business, according to the World Bank. One additional hurdle is the requirement for foreign chains to be set up as local franchises. “It’s changing, there’s good potential, but the biggest obstacle is a lack of qualified and capable franchise partners with skills and business knowledge,” said corporate lawyer Fred Burke, a managing partner at Baker and McKenzie in Vietnam.",8042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/vietnam-consumers/feature-tycoons-10-year-crusade-to-get-a-big-mac-in-vietnam-idUSL4N0G404M20130804
334,MCD,"RPT-Wall St Wk Ahead: Market to shift into lower gear as earnings, data fade","NEW YORK, Aug 4 (Reuters) - With earnings season winding down and the employment report out of the way, the U.S. stock market is likely to shift into a lower gear this week. The earnings season so far has been largely positive with more than half of the companies that have reported beating estimates. But cuts in outlooks from a number of bellwethers, including Intel and Caterpillar, mainly due to increasing concerns over China’s growth, have raised fears about the third and fourth quarters. “It has sort of become a trend now to go into earnings season with low expectations, so beating those expectations is not a big deal,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. “The market is starting to really look at outlook cuts and guidance more than earnings itself.” The market is also likely to trade sideways this week after the Dow and the S&P; 500 marked record closing highs for a second day on Friday. For the year, both the Dow and the S&P; 500 are up more than 19 percent. The S&P; 500 index has passed through two century marks this year - 1,600 and 1,700. The last time the broad market index covered more round numbers in a year was in 1998 when it touched 1,000, 1,100 and 1,200, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P; Dow Jones Indices. Of the 391 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings for the second quarter, 67.8 percent have topped analyst expectations, in line with the average beat over the past four quarters, data from Thomson Reuters showed. About 55 percent have reported revenue above estimates, more than in the past four quarters but below the historical average. Negative outlooks for the third quarter from S&P; companies have outpaced positive outlooks 3.7 to 1 so far in this earnings season, according to Thomson Reuters data. Last quarter, the ratio was 6.3 to 1, but on average since 1996, the ratio stands at 2.1 to 1. So far this earnings season, just 75 companies have given guidance and about 50 more companies are expected to give their outlook in the coming weeks. During last quarter’s earnings season, 127 S&P; companies gave guidance. The market will be closely watching remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers in the coming week for more clues on when the U.S. central bank might begin to reduce bond-buying stimulus, despite mixed signals from the jobs market. The latest jobs report on Friday showed non-farm payrolls rose by 162,000 in July, below expectations, but the unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent, its lowest since December 2008. On Tuesday, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, Charles Evans, is scheduled to speak at a press breakfast, while Richard Fisher, head of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, is to deliver a speech on the economy in Portland, Oregon, on Monday. Elsewhere, the Bank of Japan holds its monetary policy board meeting on Wednesday and Thursday. The BoJ is expected to keep monetary policy on hold as its unprecedented quantitative easing and government stimulus gradually spread through the economy. Among companies due to report earnings this week, CVS Caremark posts second-quarter results on Tuesday. McDonald’s Corp is to report July restaurant sales on Thursday. Also on Thursday, Dean Foods Co, the top U.S. dairy company, posts quarterly results. In economic news, weekly jobless claims on Thursday could offer clues about the labor market conditions following Friday’s mixed jobs report. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report on the services sector is due on Monday, and June trade data is expected on Tuesday. (Wall St Week Ahead moves every Sunday.

335,MCD,"McDonald's July sales just beat, helped by Monopoly, McWraps","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) on Thursday reported slightly higher-than-expected July sales at established restaurants after the early return of its popular Monopoly promotion and new premium wrap sandwiches helped bring U.S. gains that offset weakness in Europe and Asia. Investors had hoped that business at the seller of Big Mac hamburgers, french fries and Happy Meals would pick up meaningfully in the second half of this year, when results will compare with lackluster sales from a year ago. While McDonald’s appears to be keeping a sales edge over rivals in the United States, it and other fast-food chains such as Burger King BKW.N and Wendy’s (WEN.O) are battling for the attention of frugal diners by offering low-priced “value menus” and flashy new limited-time selections. The world’s biggest hamburger chain said global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 0.7 percent last month, slightly more than the analysts’ average estimate of 0.4 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. Moving the Monopoly giveaways from September helped same-restaurant sales in the United States to rise 1.6 percent, above the 0.3 percent gain analysts had anticipated. Still, there is “a lot of work to do, especially in overseas markets,” Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said. European same-restaurant sales fell 1.9 percent, while analysts had expected a gain of 0.3 percent. Germany, France and southern Europe were the weakest performers in the region, McDonald’s said. Europe just edges out the United States as McDonald’s top market for sales, and France, Germany and the United Kingdom are the top contributors for that region. In Asia/Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, same-restaurant sales also dropped 1.9 percent, a much sharper fall than the 0.3 percent decline that analysts targeted. The company cited weakness in Japan, Australia and China, where the outbreak of bird flu has pummeled demand. McDonald’s said the shift in the timing of Ramadan between years also hurt sales.

337,MCD,Analysis: U.S. retailers say uneven recovery keeps consumers cautious,"(Reuters) - From Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Gap Inc to Macy’s Inc and McDonald’s Corp, chains that cater to middle- and lower-income Americans say they are feeling the pinch of an uneven economic recovery. A host of retailers have reported tepid sales lately, highlighting the stress that consumers are feeling because of higher payroll taxes, expensive gasoline and a slow job market four years after the U.S. economy started to rebound. “Everyone wants to talk about recovery - it’s like the unrecovery,” Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Bob Summers said following the Wal-Mart results. “The demographic that they cater to, not only has it not seen improvement, I would argue that things have gotten worse.” Look no further than Macy’s for a snapshot of the consumer. For its namesake mid-tier department stores, Macy’s reported the first decline in same-store sales in nearly four years this week, and said shoppers had been gravitating to its less expensive items. That’s a contrast with Macy’s upscale Bloomingdale’s, which came in with strong results. The trend also turns up in results posted on Thursday by Wal-Mart, which emphasizes low pricing. Its U.S. sales at stores open at least a year unexpectedly fell 0.3 percent last quarter, a second decline in a row, prompting the world’s largest retailer to lower its sales forecast for the year. Last week, a group of U.S. retailers including Costco Wholesale Corp and Gap reported modest gains in July same-store sales, thanks largely to bargains. Adding to the pressure, Macy’s said many shoppers are redirecting their spending to their cars, housing and home improvement. Automakers reported a 14 percent U.S. sales increase in July from a year earlier, industry consultant Autodata Corp said. Wall Street analysts expect home improvement chain Home Depot to report same-store sales rose 7 percent, the biggest gain of any major retailer Thomson Reuters tracks. Outside of home improvement and cars, many retailers say economic conditions were less than ideal. In July, U.S. employers slowed their pace of hiring, with the number of jobs outside of farming increasing less than economists expected. The average price for a gallon of gasoline in the United States was still high: at the end of July, it was $3.67 compared to $3.51 a year earlier, according to the Lundberg survey. As of May, 47.6 million Americans, or one in seven, received food aid - highlighting the ongoing strain on Americans struggling to make ends meet. That was 1.1 million more than a year earlier, and 7 million more than in 2010. Real wages are also stagnating: they fell 0.1 percent between June 2012 and June 2013, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, excluding inflation and civil servants and military personnel. “The consumer doesn’t quite have the discretionary income, or they’re hesitant to spend what they do have,” Wal-Mart Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley told reporters on a call. A recent government report showed 5.7 percent of Americans who had jobs in July could not get enough hours to qualify as full-time workers, the same percentage as in June. While the unemployment rate has fallen steadily over the last year, the share of part-time workers who want more hours has barely dropped, according to BLS statistics. “Workers are not doing well,” said Elizabeth Ashack, an economist at the BLS. “They’re losing ground because wages are not growing in real terms.” Teen employment levels are down this summer, and that may be contributing to same-store sales declines at Aeropostale Inc and American Eagle Outfitters. The latest batch of retail reports shows the ways in which customers are pulling back again. Macy’s said shoppers at its namesake chain were holding back on anything nonessential, adding it didn’t expect to make up the sales shortfall this year and cut its forecasts. Kohl’s said comparable sales had slid for purchases paid for with a credit card, transactions typically made by people on a budget. And both Wal-Mart and Costco said sales of higher-ticket items such as electronics and games have been soft. Several companies have said shoppers are waiting longer to buy back-to-school items, suggesting they are waiting for deals and that they see no urgency to hit stores. This week’s results may presage more of the same next week, when big chains like Target Corp, J.C. Penney Co Inc and Sears Holdings Corp report earnings. In May, Target cut its profit forecast after weak sales, and this week Wells Fargo lowered its profit estimates for the discounter saying Target was unlikely to have been spared by the pullback in spending. The S&P; Index retail was down 1.9 percent on Thursday, and many retail experts predicted it will be slow going for the industry for a while. “The U.S. consumer is weary in this turnaround. It has been quite anemic, relatively speaking. I think many of them just don’t see it on Main Street,” said Eric Beder at Brean Capital LLC.

338,MCD,Departed P&G; CEO made 5 percent more last year as bonus rose,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co said on Friday it paid Bob McDonald, the former chairman, president and chief executive who abruptly left last spring, nearly 5 percent more last year as the company’s performance improved. McDonald was replaced in P&G;’s top spot on May 23 by his predecessor, A.G. Lafley. While McDonald’s departure was termed a retirement, many saw the change as confirmation that his tenure was a disappointment and that the world’s largest household products maker needed Lafley to reassure investors and employees. McDonald earned a $3.3 million bonus in fiscal 2013, up from $2.4 million a year earlier, when P&G; started a major restructuring. Lafley earned almost $2 million as he took the helm for the last few weeks of the fiscal year, including salary, bonus and cash instead of stock and option awards, according to the P&G; proxy filing. In the fiscal year that ended in June, largely overseen by McDonald, P&G; started to rebound with gains in market share. The company met or exceeded targets that are factored into executives’ compensation. Fiscal 2013 core earnings per share rose 5 percent, exceeding the company’s forecast of a decline of 1 percent to an increase of 4 percent. Free cash flow productivity also exceeded its goal, and organic sales rose 3 percent, the midpoint of P&G;’s forecast of 2 percent to 4 percent. Organic sales exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange. In fiscal 2012, P&G; issued profit warnings and McDonald admitted the company was too slow to react to thriftier shopping habits, create product hits, and expand in fast-growing international markets. McDonald’s salary was flat at $1.6 million and his longer-term compensation was relatively unchanged. Overall, he took home more than $15.9 million, up from nearly $15.2 million the year before. From May 23 to June 30, Lafley earned $1.94 million. He took home an additional $94,000 for consulting work during the year before he came back as CEO, bringing his total compensation to nearly $2.04 million, P&G; said.",8232013,http://www.reuters.com/article/procter-proxy/departed-pg-ceo-made-5-percent-more-last-year-as-bonus-rose-idUSL2N0GN0PW20130823
339,MCD,"UPDATE 2-U.S. fast-food workers protest, demand a 'living wage'","By Atossa Araxia Abrahamian NEW YORK, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Fast-food workers went on strike and protested outside McDonald’s, Burger King  and other restaurants in 60 U.S. cities on Thursday, in the largest protest of an almost year-long campaign to raise service sector wages. Rallies were held in cities from New York to Oakland and stretched into the South, historically difficult territory for organized labor. The striking workers say they want to unionize without retaliation in order to collectively bargain for a “living wage.” They are demanding $15 an hour, more than twice the federal minimum of $7.25. The median wage for front-line fast-food workers is $8.94 per hour, according to an analysis of government data by the National Employment Law Project (NELP), an advocacy group for lower-wage workers. “It’s almost impossible to get by (alone),” said McDonald’s worker Rita Jennings, 37, who was among about 100 protesters who marched in downtown Detroit Thursday. “You have to live with somebody to make it.” Jennings said that in her 11 years at McDonald’s, she has never received a raise above her wage of $7.40 an hour. In Atlanta, about 20 fast-food workers at two different chains presented their managers with “strike letters” before walking out, Roger Sikes, a coordinator with the nonprofit group Atlanta Jobs With Justice, told Reuters. And in Oakland, about 80 fast-food workers from various restaurants and their supporters rallied outside a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet. “I’m doing it for the respect for myself and for my other coworkers,” said Ryan Schuetz, 20, who works at McDonald’s. He said his work hours have been reduced recently and that he was struggling to keep a roof over his head. Several politicians came out in support of the protesters on Thursday. In New York City, mayoral candidate and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn joined several hundred demonstrators outside a McDonald’s in midtown Manhattan, holding a sign that read “On Strike: Wages Too Damn Low.” “Better pay will put more money into local businesses and spur economic growth,” Democratic Representative George Miller of California said in a statement. Robert Hiltonsmith, a policy analyst at Demos, a liberal think tank, said that if the minimum wage had kept up with productivity and inflation, it would be closer to $17 per hour. He added that in many cases, low pay wasn’t justified by a worker’s lack of marketable skills. “Seventy percent of these fast-food workers are aged 20 or over, so they’re not teenagers, and of that 70 percent, about a third of them have college degrees,” he said. “So it’s not that they don’t have skills - in many cases, the jobs aren’t there for them.” Thursday’s demonstrations in 60 cities followed several smaller strikes this year in the $200 billion U.S. fast-food sector, organizers said. Last November, some 200 workers walked off their fast-food jobs in New York City, and groups in Chicago, Kansas City, Detroit and other cities followed their lead in April and July. Fast-food wage activists are now receiving financial and technical support from the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Their active online presence echoes Occupy Wall Street - a movement that several supporters of the protests cited as an inspiration. Restaurant chains and trade groups say the protests are unwarranted because fast-food and retail outlets provide Americans with millions of good jobs with competitive pay and ample opportunities to rise through the ranks. “Our history is full of examples of individuals who worked their first job with McDonald’s and went on to successful careers both within and outside of McDonald’s,” the company said in a statement. In an emailed statement, Burger King said the company respects the rights of its workers but “does not make hiring, firing or other employment-related decisions for our franchisees.” The restaurant chains have not changed their wage policies despite the recent strikes. The National Retail Federation called the strikes “further proof that the labor movement (has) abdicated their role in an honest and rational discussion about the American workforce.” And in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, the conservative Employment Policies Institute ran a full-page ad with a picture of a robot making pancakes, warning that higher wages would mean “fewer entry-level jobs and more automated alternatives.” “You can either raise prices and lose customers, or (automate) those jobs,” said Michael Saltsman, EPI’s research director. “The idea that restaurants are rolling in the money is not representative of the situation franchisees face.” Dorian Warren, an assistant professor of political science at Columbia University who has published work on labor organizing and inequality, said new protests in the South are “a huge, huge deal.” “The South has always been the model for low wage employment, from slavery to the Jim Crow laws, to the present. It’s also the most anti-union part of the country, so the fact that workers feel empowered enough to take collective action is enormous,” he noted.

Encouraging economic data from China reinforced the view the world’s second-largest economy was stabilizing and gave investors further reason to buy. All 10 S&P; industry sectors ended higher, though energy  was pressured by a drop in crude oil prices. Tech shares  also came off their highs as Apple Inc fell sharply, weighing on the S&P; and Nasdaq. Analysts said new developments about Syria reduced risk for  financial markets as Syria accepted a Russian proposal to give up chemical weapons and win a reprieve from U.S. military strikes. “Several things continue to calm investors and make equities look attractive,” said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management in New York. “The new proposal creates a potential scenario where the U.S. doesn’t have to go in militarily. We were worried not just about Syria, but also the impact that this would spread to other nations in the Middle East.” After the S&P; 500 posted its worst monthly performance since May 2012 in August, the broad index has rallied 3.1 percent over the past six straight sessions of gains. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 127.94 points, or 0.85 percent, at 15,191.06. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 12.28 points, or 0.73 percent, at 1,683.99. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 22.84 points, or 0.62 percent, at 3,729.02. Geopolitical uncertainty has driven market movement in recent weeks, with investors especially watching global oil prices for any sign that military action could constrain supply. With that threat seemingly less likely, oil prices fell 2 percent on Tuesday. Shares of Apple fell 2.3 percent to $494.65 after the company’s latest product unveilings, which included two new versions of its iPhone line. About 6.5 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, above the daily average so far this year of about 6.24 billion shares. About 64 percent of companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed higher on Tuesday while 64 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares ended up. Economic data in China showed stronger-than-expected industrial output while retail sales grew at the fastest pace this year. “Investors were worried about how far China would have to fall until it found some kind of economic equilibrium, and it looks like it found the level,” said Zemsky, who helps oversee $180 billion. “That calms fears that the major sources of growth are still out there and not sputtering along.” S&P; Dow Jones Indices announced the biggest shake-up for the Dow Jones Industrial Average in almost a decade, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Visa Inc and Nike Inc  replacing Bank of America Corp, Hewlett-Packard Co  and Alcoa Inc, respectively.

Also lifting the S&P; 500 index for a sixth straight day was encouraging economic data from Chinal. Nine of the 10 S&P; 500 sectors rose, the only exception being energy, which dipped with a drop in crude oil prices. Fears of action against Syria eased after U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday he saw a possible breakthrough in the situation after Russia proposed that Syria hand over its chemical weapons for destruction, a proposal Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halki said his country supported. While such a move could avert a potential Western-led military strike, the White House said Obama would press ahead with his plan to ask Congress to approve the use of military force against the country. “We don’t know if this is just talk or if it could happen, but right now tensions have cooled and the market likes that,” said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc in San Antonio.” The Dow Jones industrial average was up 116.90 points, or 0.78 percent, at 15,180.02.

343,MCD,"UPDATE 2-Europe buoys McDonald's in August, but worries linger","By Lisa Baertlein Sept 10 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp reported a bigger-than-expected 1.9 percent increase in global sales at established restaurants in August, after a revival in France helped drive solid results in Europe, its top market. Although the results from the world’s biggest fast-food chain soundly beat the average estimate of a 0.3 percent increase from 16 analysts polled by Consensus Metrix, McDonald’s shares rose only slightly in morning trading on Tuesday. McDonald’s had a big lead over rivals during the depths of the global recession. But Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson recently has had to fight to maintain that distance as resurgent chains such as Burger King Worldwide Inc and Wendy’s Co  tempt still-frugal diners with low-priced “value menus” and flashy new limited-time selections ranging from “premium” pretzel burgers to indulgent bacon sundaes. Analysts maintained their cautious stance on McDonald’s, citing its continued dependence on Dollar Menu sales and uncertainty over whether new premium items such as Mighty Wings will draw customers. “Given the company’s mixed results with premium platforms thus far this year, we are maintaining our current” estimate for flat third-quarter sales at restaurants open at least 13 months, Jefferies & Co analyst Andy Barish said in a client note. McDonald’s said new premium wrap sandwiches and high-margin drinks such as blended smoothies and frappes helped bolster sales in Europe, where same-restaurant sales were up 3.3 percent in August. Sales growth resumed in France during the month, and the company also pointed to strength in the United Kingdom and Russia. Analysts had expected a 0.1 percent fall for Europe, which just edges out the United States as McDonald’s top market. Same-restaurant sales in the United States slightly missed the mark - rising 0.2 percent in August, rather than the 0.8 percent analysts had expected. In Asia/Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, same-restaurant sales fell less than expected, as declines in Japan somewhat eased. Sales in the region were off 0.5 percent for August, while analysts had called for a 1 percent drop.

Fears of action against Syria eased after U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday he saw a possible breakthrough in the crisis with Syria after Russia proposed that its ally Damascus hands over its chemical weapons for destruction, which could avert planned U.S. military strikes. Syrian Prime Minister Wael al-Halki said his country supported a Russian proposal for Damascus to give up chemical weapons to avoid a possible U.S. military strike. “Certainly there was the potential for escalation, which was the market’s primary concern, and that seemed to be the issue out there,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. Economic data in China showed stronger-than-expected industrial output and retail sales showed their fastest growth this year, reinforcing signs that the world’s second-largest economy was stabilizing after slowing for more than two years. “Another good China-data day and that has certainly been helping,” Ghriskey said. “Anything that is going to forestall a strike on Syria certainly gets the risk appetite back into the marketplace.” However, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama would press ahead with his plan to ask Congress to approve the use of military force in Syria, despite Syria’s recent acceptance of the Russian proposal. Oil prices pulled back, with U.S. crude off 2.1 percent. Crude prices rose 2.7 percent last week on worries a strike against Syria could spark a wider conflict and heightened supply concerns. After suffering its worst monthly performance since May 2012 in August, the S&P; 500 has rallied for the past five sessions for a 2.4 percent gain that marks its longest winning streak in two months. S&P; 500 futures rose 9.9 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract.

351,MCD,Cubs deal Pirates costly loss,"Cubs deal Pirates costly loss CHICAGO — The Chicago Cubs closed a dismal home season on a positive note as Darnell McDonald’s three-run homer helped secure a 4-2 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday. But the final home victory didn’t ease the sting of a 31-50 record at Wrigley Field, the worst in franchise history. “It’s obviously the defining thing on our season,” Cubs manager Dale Sveum said. “It’s disappointing because the fans have been great, and to lose 50 games is something you don’t even think about at home. It’s very difficult to take.” McDonald went 3-for-4 and broke a 1-1 tie with his sixth inning homer off Pirates starter Francisco Liriano (16-8). The victory snapped a three-game Cubs losing streak and salvaged the finale of the three-game series. Starter Jake Arrieta (4-2) won his second straight decision while reliever Kevin Gregg worked the ninth for his 33rd save. The Pirates, already in the postseason as a National League wild card qualifier, fell three games behind St. Louis in the NL Central Division title race with three games to play. Darwin Barney and Anthony Rizzo each had two hits for the Cubs. Marte and Morneau each had a pair for the Pirates. Barney doubled with one out in the first and Chicago jumped to a 1-0 lead in the first as Rizzo collected his team-leading 79th RBI with a single. Pittsburgh matched the run in the second, loading the bases. Arrieta walked Justin Morneau with two out, forcing in Starling Marte for a 1-1 tie. Starlin Castro’s error allowed Pedro Alvarez to reach third to open the fourth, but the Pirates came up empty as Tony Sanchez popped out to short and Clint Barmes lined into a double play. Pittsburgh also had a runner at third in the sixth but failed to deliver. Morneau doubled to open the inning and advanced on a fielder’s choice. But Alvarez grounded to first and Sanchez struck out looking. “That’s been one of the challenges we’ve had throughout the season,” Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said. “We’ve got to find ways to cash in on those situations. It’s tough to continue to pitch without a safety net.” McDonald’s three-run homer to left center with none out in the sixth snapped a 1-1 tie and brought home Donnie Murphy and Junior Lake. It was his first homer of the season. “It was very sweet,” he said. “That’s one of the things that all of us can learn from right now. We’re trying to get to where these teams are at that we’re playing down the stretch, really watching how they go about their business and how they play the game.” Liriano departed after that homer in favor of right-hander Vin Mazzaro. Liriano officially pitched six innings, allowing four runs on eight hits. He struck out eight and walked just one. “It’s not the way you want to finish the year,” Liriano said. Arrieta, meanwhile, did not return for the seventh. He allowed one run on four hits, walked two and struck out one. “It was a playoff-caliber baseball game right there,” Arrieta said. “One trying to win the division and the other team trying to finish on a high note. It was as a well-played game, pitched well on both sides.” Pirate pinch hitter Jose Tabata tripled with one out in the ninth off Gregg, driving in pinch runner Felix Pie to cut the Cubs led to 4-2.

352,MCD,Want fruit with your burger? McDonald's expands anti-obesity push,"(Reuters) - Hold the fries, pass the salad. McDonald’s Corp on Thursday said it would offer healthy options as part of its popular value meals, letting customers choose a side salad, fruit or vegetables instead of french fries. The announcement by the world’s largest fast-food chain comes as more companies respond to government and consumer pressure to address the global obesity epidemic. McDonald’s, which often bears the brunt of criticism over the restaurant industry’s penchant for tempting diners with indulgent and often high-calorie food, said it would offer the option in all of its 20 major global markets by 2020. McDonald’s also vowed to promote and market only water, milk and juice as the beverages in its popular Happy Meals for children as part of its announcement at the Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York on Thursday. Waist sizes around the world are increasing, setting off alarms in public health circles. In recent years, the U.S. food industry has begun yielding to pressure from government, parents and consumers seeking to slim down adults and children. Sugary sodas have been yanked from public schools; sugar, sodium and calorie levels have been reduced in products, and calorie counts have been posted on some restaurant menus. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit that has tangled with McDonald’s over everything from fattening food to the marketing of Happy Meals, approved of the company’s move to add more fruits and vegetables to the menu. Still, it says the company and its rivals have a long way to go in terms of offering healthier options. “McDonald’s slow march toward healthier meals made a major advance today, but a long road lies ahead for the company,” CSPI said in a statement. McDonald’s is seen as something of a trend setter among restaurant chains, but like many of its peers, it has tended to resist external efforts to force change. About one year ago McDonald’s said it would begin listing calorie information on menus in some 14,000 U.S. restaurants and drive-throughs — ahead of a national rule that would require larger restaurant chains to make such disclosures but months after other chains embraced the idea. In July 2011 it tweaked its popular Happy Meals for children - reducing the french fries portion by more than half and adding apples to every order. The move came after pressure from CSPI, parent groups and others. More than one-third of Americans are obese, and about 10 percent of the nation’s healthcare bill is tied to obesity-related illnesses, such as Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and hypertension, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. McDonald’s said its announcement is part of a plan developed with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, which was founded by the Clinton Foundation and American Heart Association, to increase customers’ access to fruit and vegetables and help families and children to make informed eating and lifestyle choices.

358,MCD,CORRECTED-Majority of U.S. fast-food workers need public assistance -study,"(Changes “Medicare” to “Medicaid” in 3rd paragraph) By Atossa Araxia Abrahamian NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - More than half of low-wage workers employed by the largest U.S. fast-food restaurants earn so little that they must rely on public assistance to get by, according to a study released on Tuesday. This ends up costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars a year, the study said. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau and public benefit programs show 52 percent of fast-food cooks, cashiers and other “front-line” staff had relied on at least one form of public assistance, such as Medicaid, food stamps and the Earned Income Tax Credit program, between 2007 and 2011, researchers at the University of California-Berkeley and the University of Illinois said. In a concurrent report, the pro-labor National Employment Law Project found that the 10 largest fast-food companies in the United States cost taxpayers more than $3.8 billion each year in public assistance because the workers do not make enough to pay for basic necessities themselves. “It doesn’t matter whether you work or shop at McDonald’s or not, the low-wage business model is expensive for everybody,” said NELP policy analyst Jack Temple, who worked on the report.  “Companies ... are basically pushing off part of their costs on the taxpayers.” The studies follow large nationwide demonstrations in August, when fast-food workers went on strike and protested outside McDonald’s, Burger King and other restaurants in 60 U.S. cities, demanding a “living wage” of $15 per hour. The U.S. fast-food industry generates sales of $200 billion a year. The companies have long said that mostly young people do the entry-level work of flipping burgers or making milkshakes and that these positions are stepping stones to higher-paying jobs. However, the NELP found that the median age of a fast-food worker was 28, Temple said. McDonald’s Corp and Burger King Worldwide Inc did not respond to requests for comment. Wendy’s Co declined to comment, and Yum Brands Inc did not immediately provide a comment. The Employment Policies Institute, which has opposed calls for higher fast-food wages in the past, said in a statement that the reports “ignore economic evidence that dramatic wage hikes would make fast food workers worse off” when employers “replace employees with less-costly automated alternatives.” LOW-WAGE RUT U.C. Berkeley labor economist Sylvia Alegretto, who worked on the report from her school and the University of Illinois, said the economic recovery did not make life much easier for these workers, who are stuck in a low-wage rut. “They took it on the chin when the economy was bad, and now that it’s better, wages aren’t going up,” Alegretto said. “In fact, they’re making less than their counterparts were 50 years ago.” Alegretto said her team was “very conservative” in estimating the number of low-wage workers, counting only those who worked more than 10 hours a week for at least 27 weeks a year. The median wage for front-line fast-food workers is $8.94 per hour, according to the NELP’s analysis of government data. Many of these jobs are not full-time. Twice as many fast-food workers enroll in public aid programs than the overall workforce because of the low wages, limited work hours, and skimpy benefits their jobs afford them, according to the Berkeley study. But even those who work full-time are struggling. More than half of these families are enrolled in public assistance programs, the researchers said. This costs taxpayers nearly $7 billion per year, more than half of which is in health insurance costs. Overall, families with a working member account for 73 percent of all enrollments, amounting to two-thirds of all public benefits spending, the study said. In other types of service work, such as maintenance, laundry and personal services, the researchers found that one-third of employees are enrolled in public assistance programs, as were about 30 percent of workers in the retail and hospitality sectors. The time frame of the Berkeley study includes the 2007-2009 recession and the subsequent years of slow economic growth. During that time, the number of workers eligible for public assistance increased in some states.

359,MCD,Wall Street nearly flat on lackluster earnings,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended little changed on Monday as lackluster earnings reports from McDonald’s and others fed concerns that equities were overpriced after the S&P; index’s run to record highs last week. Investors also showed a reluctance to make aggressive bets ahead of Tuesday’s release of U.S. payrolls data for September, which was delayed by the recent government shutdown. “You could be seeing some profit-taking” after last week’s highs, said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners, which manages more than $1 billion in assets in New York. “You could also see some profit-taking off a weak jobs number tomorrow or in advance of the number today.” Netflix (NFLX.O) shares rose 11 percent in after-hours trading on the release of its earnings report that said the company added 1.3 million U.S. streaming customers in September. Netflix’s third quarter net income reached $32 million, up from $8 million a year earlier. Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) shares were up 0.3 percent after the company’s earnings beat estimates. Analysts had expected $3.23 billion in third-quarter revenue, but the technology manufacturer reported $3.24 billion. The Dow was lower after McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) fell following a weak fourth-quarter outlook. A rally in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares after a brokerage ratings upgrade helped the Nasdaq. Advancers and decliners were about evenly split on the New York Stock exchange. Though only a small percentage of S&P; 500 stocks have reported earnings thus far, the season has been mixed, with revenue growth especially a concern. Still, profits have largely risen and many bellwether companies have topped expectations. With 21 percent of S&P; companies having reported, 61.5 percent have topped profit expectations, a rate slightly above the historical average. But only 52 percent have topped expectations on revenue, below the historical average of 61 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 7.64 points, or 0.05 percent, at 15,392.01. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 0.14 points, or 0.01 percent, at 1,744.64. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 5.77 points, or 0.15 percent, at 3,920.05. The S&P; 500 on Friday capped its biggest weekly gain in three months on stronger-than-expected earnings from Google (GOOG.O) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), as well as a deal in Washington temporarily resolving a political deadlock over the budget and raising the debt-ceiling. The S&P; managed a slight gain to again close at a record high. S&P; sectors were mixed, with healthcare stocks making the biggest decline, down 0.6 percent. Thomas Nyheim, vice president and portfolio manager at Christiana Trust in Greenville, Delaware, said the healthcare sector will be unpredictable until the effects of President Obama’s healthcare law play out. “The push for healthcare is going to be greater as more people age and come online. We just don’t know how it’s going to affect the bottom line,” said Nyheim, who manages investments in healthcare stocks. McDonald’s fell 0.6 percent to $94.59 after it reported revenue that missed estimates and warned global October sales could be relatively flat. Apple boosted the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq after Societe Generale lifted its price target on the stock to $575 from $500 and advised clients to buy shares. The stock rose 2.4 percent to $521.30 and was the largest winner on the Nasdaq, adding 7.5 points to the index. More than 25 percent of the S&P; 500 components are due to report this week.

360,MCD,"US STOCKS-S&P; 500, Dow slip on lackluster earnings","* McDonald’s pulls Dow lower; Apple helps Nasdaq tread water * Netflix, Texas Instruments to report after the close * Healthcare worst performing S&P; sector * Solar companies soar * Indexes: Dow off 0.1 pct, S&P; off 0.1 pct, Nasdaq up 0.1 pct By Julia Edwards NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 and Dow slipped on Monday as a clutch of lackluster earnings reports from McDonald’s and others fed concerns that equity valuations were getting stretched after the S&P; index’s run to record highs last week. Investors also showed a reluctance to make aggressive bets ahead of Tuesday’s release of U.S. payrolls data for September, which was delayed by the recent government shutdown. The Dow was lower after McDonald’s Corp fell following a weak fourth-quarter outlook. A rally in Apple Inc  shares after a brokerage ratings upgrade helped the Nasdaq hold near the unchanged mark. Though only a small percentage of S&P; 500 stocks have reported earnings thus far, the season has been mixed, with revenue growth especially a concern. Still, profits have largely risen and many bellwether companies have topped expectations. “We are going into earnings season and the market is just starting to digest the things that have come into play. The numbers have actually been decent, but you are just getting started,” said Thomas Nyheim, vice president and portfolio manager at Christiana Trust in Greenville, Delaware. “That’s why there is not that much movement in the market, just anticipation.” With 21 percent of S&P; companies having reported, 61.5 percent have topped profit expectations, a rate slightly above the historical average. But only 52 percent have topped expectations on revenue, below the historical average of 61 percent. The S&P; 500 on Friday capped its biggest weekly gain in three months on stronger-than-expected earnings from Google  and Morgan Stanley, as well as a deal in Washington temporarily resolving a political deadlock over the budget and raising the debt-ceiling. The S&P; ended at a record high. S&P; sectors were mixed, with healthcare stocks making the biggest decline, down 0.6 percent. Nyheim, who manages investments in health care stocks, said the sector will be unpredictable until the effects of President Obama’s health care law play out. “The push for healthcare is going to be greater as more people age and come online. We just don’t know how it’s going to affect the bottom line,” said Nyheim. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 15.81 points, or 0.10 percent, at 15,383.84. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was down 1.65 points, or 0.09 percent, at 1,742.85. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 1.99 points, or 0.05 percent, at 3,916.27. Apple boosted the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq after Societe Generale lifted its price target on the stock to $575 from $500 and advised clients to buy shares. The stock rose 2.5 percent to $521.83 and was the largest winner on the Nasdaq, adding 7.8 points to the index. McDonald’s fell 0.8 percent to $94.42 after it reported revenue that missed estimates and warned global October sales could be relatively flat. More than 25 percent of the S&P; 500 components are due to report this week, with Texas Instruments and Netflix  among the stocks to report after Monday’s market closes. While Netflix shares have soared this year, few short sellers are expecting the stock to pull back following its results, a sign of how the Federal Reserve’s stimulus program has made successful negative bets by short sellers hard to execute. Hasbro Inc jumped 5.0 percent to a new all-time high as both earnings and sales topped expectations. Solar power companies were among the strongest on Monday, with First Solar Inc up 9.5 percent to $54.76 as the S&P;’s top percentage gainer. Trina Solar rose 4.6  percent to $17.32 while SolarCity Corp gained 2.1 percent to $60.60. JPMorgan Chase & Co reached a tentative $13 billion deal with the U.S. government to settle investigations into bad mortgage loans sold to investors by JPMorgan and the banks it bought during the financial crisis.

361,MCD,McDonald's forecasts tough fourth quarter,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) warned on Monday that global sales at established restaurants would be relatively flat in October and signaled that weakness would continue in the fourth quarter amid stiff competition and a halting economic recovery, heaping pressure on its chief executive. CEO Don Thompson, at the helm for more than a year, has switched top management and shaken up menus to boost sales and profits. Now, analysts are asking if McDonald’s woes are due to poor execution rather than external factors. The company has reported four straight quarters of disappointing sales, Hedgeye Risk Management restaurant analyst Howard Penney said on Twitter. “When will the (company) transition from blaming the economy to internal issues?” said Penney, who told Reuters that McDonald’s high-profile McCafe coffee and beverage expansion masked a slowdown in its core business of selling hamburgers and french fries. McDonald’s shares fell 1 percent in midday trading after investors digested the company’s forecast for restaurant margin declines in the fourth quarter similar to those suffered in this year’s first quarter. The outlook suggested more margin pressure than the market was expecting, Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told Reuters. McDonald’s, which has roughly seven times the sales of Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N combined, has been slower than its rivals in adapting to changing consumer demands. Shares of Burger King inched up 0.2 percent and Wendy’s rose 0.6 percent. Global sales at McDonald’s restaurants open at least 13 months gained 0.9 percent in the third quarter, falling just short of analysts’ average estimate on softer-than-expected results in all of the company’s major markets, according to Consensus Metrix. In the United States, McDonald’s Monopoly game promotion and Mighty Wings limited-time offer met internal expectations but failed to substantially lift results amid intense discounting. While fast-food chains fight hard for the business of cash-crunched, lower-income diners, former McDonald’s unit Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) is enjoying more visits from wealthier - and often younger - diners. “We think (McDonald’s) is losing its appeal to the millennial generation, who prefer healthier foods,” S&P; Capital IQ analyst Jim Yin said in a note. Such customers are often more willing to pay a bit more for their meals. France, which leads McDonald’s top revenue market of Europe, reported its first quarter of same-restaurant sales growth in a year in the third quarter, while results in Germany remained rocky. McDonald’s lacks the ability to raise prices in Europe, CEO Thompson said on a conference call with analysts. Both Japan and China reported declines in same-restaurant sales for the quarter, dragging down results from the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Based on the results, McDonald’s is delaying new restaurant openings in emerging markets like China. A recent survey from Goldman Sachs suggested McDonald’s, which has lagged rivals in introducing popular new menu items, might be losing favor with U.S. diners. The company, which built a large lead over rivals after the global recession, is fighting to step up sales in the United States amid a barrage of new items and short-time specials from smaller chains. McDonald’s previously got a sales bump from new products including oatmeal, sandwich wraps and lattes, but its more complicated menu has slowed service at the drive-thru window. Third-quarter net income rose 4.6 percent to $1.52 billion, or $1.52 per share, coming in a penny better than the analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was up 2.4 percent at $7.32 billion. Restaurant margins at both franchised and company-operated stores slipped in the quarter. McDonald’s shares were down 91 cents to $94.29 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The S&P; 500 on Friday capped its biggest weekly gain in three months on stronger-than-expected earnings from companies including Google and Morgan Stanley and as a deal in Washington helped avert a possible government default and reopened the federal government after a 16-day shutdown. “It is positive that investors are focusing on company fundamentals” and not on political dealings in Washington, said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. “The good news is we’re returning to reactions that are stock specific,” he said. Apple led gains on the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq after Societe Generale lifted its price target on the stock to $575 from $500 and advised clients to buy shares. The stock rose 2.3 percent to $520.82. Shares of McDonald’s fell 0.9 percent to $94.35, ranking the restaurant chain as the top point decliner in the Dow industrials. McDonald’s reported revenue that missed estimates and warned global October sales could be relatively flat. Other companies expected to report results on Monday include Netflix and Texas Instruments. More than 25 percent of the S&P; 500 components are due to report this week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.83 points or 0.05 percent, to 15,391.82, the S&P; 500 gained 0.62 points or 0.04 percent, to 1,745.12 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 11.153 points or 0.28 percent, to 3,925.431. Hasbro, up 7.7 percent at $50.91, was one of the top performers on the S&P; 500 after the toy maker topped Wall Street’s profit estimates. JPMorgan Chase & Co shares edged up after it reached a tentative $13 billion deal with the U.S. government to settle investigations into bad mortgage loans sold to investors by JPMorgan and the banks it bought during the financial crisis. Shares rose 0.4 percent to $54.51. “A settlement of this size brings closure for many and it allows them to put the episode behind,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Shares of Tellabs Inc rose 4 percent to $2.45 after the network services provider agreed to be taken private by Marlin Equity Partners for $891 million. The market barely reacted to news that U.S. home resales fell in September and prices rose at their slowest pace in five months, in the latest signs higher mortgage rates were taking some edge off the housing market recovery. Japan’s exports rose but were well short of expectations in September, a sign that slowing demand in Asia was taking the shine off Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s stimulus policies and clouding the outlook for a recovery.",10212013,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-wall-street-mixed-with-eyes-on-earnings-idUSL1N0IB0TF20131021
365,MCD,Ketchup changeup: McDonald's dropping Heinz after CEO change,"(Reuters) - World’s biggest fast-food chain seeks new ketchup for its famous french fries. McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) on Friday said it plans to end its 40-year relationship with ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co, since that company is now led by Bernardo Hees, the former chief executive of hamburger rival Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N. “As a result of recent management changes at Heinz, we have decided to transition our business to other suppliers over time,” McDonald’s said in a statement. “We have spoken to Heinz and plan to work together to ensure a smooth and orderly transition,” said McDonald’s, which has more than 34,000 restaurants around the globe. Heinz declined to comment. “As a matter of policy, Heinz does not comment on relationships with customers,” company spokesman Michael Mullen said. The switch will be more apparent overseas than in the United States, as McDonald’s only serves Heinz ketchup in two domestic markets - Pittsburgh and Minneapolis, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported on Friday. Indeed, ketchup packages handed out at McDonald’s restaurants in the United States often say only “fancy ketchup.” Most in-store ketchup dispensers are not branded. The move from McDonald’s could benefit Heinz ketchup rivals Hunt’s, owned by ConAgra Foods Inc (CAG.N), and Del Monte. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and an investment fund affiliated with 3G Capital bought Heinz for $28 billion in June and immediately named Hees CEO. Burger King went public in June 2012, less than two years after it was taken private by 3G Capital Management LLC, which retains a stake in the fast-food chain. Burger King has been a Heinz customer for “decades” and uses its products in roughly 80 percent of markets around the world, spokesman Miguel Piedra told Reuters.

367,MCD,Local tastes tempt China diners away from Golden Arches,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Bearing rice burgers and lotus roots, an army of Chinese fast food firms is cooking up a challenge to McDonald’s Corp and Yum Brands Inc, tempting cost-conscious diners with healthy, homegrown fare and causing a drag on growth for the U.S. chains in the country’s $174 billion fast food market. McDonald’s said last week it was thinking of slowing expansion in China as diners are tempted by local rivals. KFC-parent Yum warned this month economic weakness in China would drag on a recovery in sales dented by a food safety scare at the end of last year. Meanwhile, local firms such as chicken chain Dicos, Country Style Cooking, and Kung Fu Catering have been nibbling away at the dominance of their U.S. rivals. “I’m a bit sick of Western fast food. There’s too much oil, and you hear things like chickens having six legs,” said student Tang Mei, 25, as she dined at Taiwanese-owned fast food outlet Dicos. “Health concerns have really made people worried.” McDonald’s and Yum are still the largest fast food chains in China but, despite heavy investment, McDonald’s has seen its market share by value stagnate at 2.3 percent since 2007, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor. Yum, which held 6.5 percent last year, is up slightly over the same period, but has seen same-store sales hit after a food scare last year and a local outbreak of avian flu. Yum has 5,600 KFC and Pizza Hut China stores, to McDonald’s has 1,800 local outlets. Brands like Ting Hsin International-owned Dicos, the third largest fast food brand in China, have taken note. The firm, which plans to triple its store count to around 3,700 by 2020, says it aims to “break the traditional Western fast food mould”. While conceived in the image of KFC - its name is a play on “Texas” in Chinese - Dicos now also pushes its Chinese roots. Its website displays an ornate blue ceramic bowl steaming with traditional herbal tea, while rice cake burgers and soybean milk flank the chain’s more traditional nuggets and crispy wings. “After all, since ancient times rice has been the key staple of the Chinese people,” explained Zhuang Weitang, a spokesman for Ting Hsin International, adding the brand was planning to up its drive towards healthier, Chinese-style cooking. “It’s the mix (of traditional chicken) with new, health-focused Chinese specialties that has helped us create a niche in the fiercely-competitive Chinese fast-food market.” In a slowing economy, many consumers are trading down to cheaper alternatives or simply dining at home, said analysts, which has contributed to the growth rate in the wider fast food market halving over the last 5 years to 8 percent this year. Lunch at Dicos costs less than 17 yuan ($2.80) compared with a similar offering from KFC, which costs 25 yuan ($4.11), according to Mintel. “Local establishments generally also do a better job catering to local tastes,” said Karla Wang, associate research director at market research firm TNS China. “These familiar ‘comfort foods’ often go a long way in soothing frazzled consumers during times of uncertainty.” Diners have even started to question international chains’ quality, traditionally a strong point after scandals ranging from the use of recycled “gutter oil” for cooking to industrial chemical-laced milk made consumers wary of local products. But a number of scares over the last year, including reports that some chicken purchased by KFC and McDonald’s had been fed excess antibiotics, seems to have altered consumer views. Only one-in-four Chinese thought Western fast food was healthier and better quality than Chinese alternatives, said a recent report from research firm Mintel. McDonald’s and Yum have taken note. “We address food quality and food safety in all aspects of our communication; most recently, we launched a Moms’ Trust campaign... and we will be doing more in this area,” said Jessica Lee, a Shanghai-based spokeswoman for McDonald’s. Yum officials were not immediately available for comment. The company has trimmed its local supply chain and plans to launch a new China quality assurance campaign in November that will feature KFC employees, suppliers and poultry farmers. “We still have work to do, but we know we are doing the right things to regain consumer trust and we remain confident that our best days for KFC in China are yet to come,” Chief Executive David Novak said in an analysts call on October 9. As trust of domestic brands grows, diners are being increasingly drawn to local dishes, perceived as healthier due to a wider variety of ingredients, while there is mounting interest in traditional Chinese food and dining culture. Last year a documentary called “A Bite of China” aired on local television drawing more than 100 million viewers, making it the most successful documentary in China since the 1990s. Chinese heritage has become a key selling point. Kung Fu Catering, which sports an emblem of martial artist Bruce Lee, underscores its local credentials by playing up the natural ingredients for its Chinese-style food against backgrounds of Chinese mountains, wispy clouds and bamboo. Others such as Country Style Cooking, CNHLS and Gll Wonton, owned by Shanghai Shihao Catering, all offer fast food with a Chinese flavor. Though some way behind Yum and McDonald’s in terms of size, all are taking market share from the huge independent sector of single shops and stalls. Local brands also perform strongly in regions away from the saturated east coast market, catering to local tastes in areas seen as the China’s next drivers for growth. “Country Style Cooking is really strong in western China, while Kung Fu Catering is from Shenzhen and does well with more rice-based Chinese set meals, which fit the trend towards less oily and healthier food,” said James Roy, Shanghai-based senior analyst at China Market Research Group. China’s influential netizens also suggest the U.S. firms are struggling to remain the flavor of the month. Chatter about the two brands on China’s Twitter-like Weibo fell to an almost two-year low in September, according to analysis by Reuters.

The tests will include packages of whole bean and ground coffee as well as “single-cup” options, which typically include K-cups for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters’ GMCR.O popular Keurig brewer. Test markets and pricing were not disclosed. “We want to work with McDonald’s to help consumers enjoy McCafe premium coffee in the comfort and convenience of their own homes,” Kraft Foods CEO Tony Vernon told analysts on a conference call, disclosing the test for the first time. Kraft will handle the marketing and distribution of the McDonald’s brand coffee. McDonald’s said in a statement it was “building on the momentum of our McCafe beverages in our restaurants by expanding these options.” Sales at McDonald’s have gotten a big boost from its introduction of McCafe beverages, which include coffee and espresso drinks like those popularized by Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O). Coffee chains such as Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts sell packaged coffee and K-cups through their shops and other retailers. McDonald’s last year starting selling packaged coffee at some of its Canadian restaurants. Kraft got back into the U.S. premium grocery coffee business in August 2011, with a deal to sell Gevalia coffee in supermarkets. Vernon said on the call Gevalia sales have exceeded company expectations. Kraft had a contentious split with Starbucks in March 2011. Starbucks on Wednesday said it expected to resolve its dispute before the end of calendar 2013.

The world’s largest hamburger chain warned a few weeks ago that global sales at established restaurants would be relatively flat in October, and signaled that weakness would continue in the fourth quarter amid stiff competition and a halting economic recovery. Analysts have also raised concerns the company is suffering from execution issues rather than external factors as its results over the past year show it has been slower in adapting to changing consumer demands compared to Wendy’s Co and Burger King Worldwide Inc. McDonald’s global sales at restaurants open for more than a year rose 0.5 percent in October, but the growth was below the average analyst estimate of 0.6 percent, according to nine analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Comparable-restaurant sales grew 0.2 percent in the United States, falling short of the 0.7 percent expected by analysts. In Europe, sales rose 0.8 percent as more customers ate at its restaurants in the UK, France and Russia. McDonald’s said sales in Asia Pacific region, the Middle East and Africa fell 2.8 percent, mainly due to negative results in Japan. The company did not elaborate on its Japan performance.

377,MCD,U.S. fast-food workers rally for higher minimum wage,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fast-food workers in hundreds of U.S. cities staged a day of rallies on Thursday to demand higher wages, saying the pay was too low to feed a family and forced most to accept public assistance. The protests escalated a series of actions at several Walmart stores on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, seeking to draw attention to workers at the lowest end of the wage scale. The description of fast-food workers, once viewed mainly as teenagers looking for pocket money or a first job, has changed. Today’s fast-food worker is typically over 20, often raising a child, and 68 percent are the primary wage earners in their families, according to a report by the University of Illinois and the University of California, Berkeley. About 100 workers in Chicago marched along Michigan Avenue with a large costumed Grinch, chanting: “We can’t survive on $7.25.” Protesters want the hourly U.S. minimum wage raised to $15 from $7.25. In Kansas City, Missouri, Kizzy Sanders, 30, an employee at a local Popeye’s restaurant, joined about 100 protesters picketing fast-food restaurants in freezing temperatures. “I love my job, I love the people I work with, but the $7.70 I make does not cut it,” said Sanders, a mother of three. “It doesn’t pay my bills, I can’t buy my kids anything for Christmas. I can’t even celebrate Christmas.” Thursday’s protests were organized by groups such as “Fast Food Forward” and “Low Pay is Not OK” that have the support of labor union giant Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 2 million members including healthcare, janitorial and security workers. POVERTY-LEVEL WAGES Despite the involvement of organized labor, the protests are focused on wages, not unions, for the moment, said John Logan, a labor studies professor at San Francisco State University’s College of Business. “The immediate goal is to focus national attention on the impact of poverty-level wages on employees and the negative impact of poverty-level wages for the public and the economy,” Logan said. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau and public benefit programs show 52 percent of fast-food workers relying on at least one form of public assistance, between 2007 and 2011, according to the report from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Illinois. Shemethia Betler, a 33-year-old mother and cashier at a Washington-area McDonald’s who earns $8.25 an hour, receives food stamps and temporary cash assistance, and said she feels like she is on the brink of homelessness. “I’m worker and I’m making 8.25 an hour, and I have two kids and I’m living in poverty,” Betler said during a protest in Washington. Because the current minimum wage, on an inflation-adjusted basis, lags behind those of decades past, the purchasing power of minimum-wage earners has diminished. Increasing the minimum wage, however, would not reduce poverty, said Michael Saltsman of the Employment Policies Institute, because employers will compensate by reducing staff and workers’ hours. Instead, they should expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, which provides a small-wage supplement for low-income families in the form of a tax refund, he said. A 2012 study published by the Employment Policies Institute found that states that increase the Earned Income Tax Credit by 1 percent saw a 1 percent drop in state poverty rates. Others disagree. Christian Dorsey, director of external and governmental affairs for the Economic Policy Institute, said tax credits should not let employers skimp on wages. “Businesses have a responsibility to pay workers enough to keep them out of poverty,” Dorsey said. “The idea that we would simply not look at wages is passing off the problem to someone else.” Jose Martinez, 26, a KFC cook who joined about 100 protesters outside a McDonald’s in Oakland, California, said he still lived with his parents and recently dropped out of welding school because he could not afford the tuition. He said his job paid $8.25 an hour. “If I made $15 an hour, I would support my parents, move out and go back to school,” Martinez said.

378,MCD,McDonald's November sales miss as U.S. weakness persists,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) on Monday reported another sluggish month of sales at established restaurants, results that suggest the famed hamburger chain is losing U.S. market share to rivals. The fast-food chain, the world’s largest by revenue, has struggled for more than a year to significantly increase those monthly sales, hindered by slack demand and intense competition for the business of budget-conscious diners. November’s biggest disappointment came from the United States, where monthly sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.8 percent, versus the 0.3 percent gain expected, on average, by 14 analysts polled by Consensus Metrix. “McDonald’s U.S. trends imply a rare period of share losses,” RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said in a client note. Wall Street initially expected the chain’s fortunes to turn this past spring because its results would be compared with weak monthly numbers starting in the spring of 2012. But McDonald’s executives recently signaled that weakness would continue in the fourth quarter amid stiff competition and halting global economic growth. Chief Executive Don Thompson, at the helm of McDonald’s for more than a year, has switched top management and shaken up menus to boost sales and profits. Still, analysts say the chain appears to be losing out to rivals at all meal times except breakfast - where it has long been a leader. Some analysts worry that the company’s woes are the result of poor execution rather than external factors. In particular, they say, new menu items such as lattes, smoothies, salads and wraps have slowed McDonald’s service in a business where hyper-competitive drive-thru times are measured in the seconds. McDonald’s latest move was to switch its value-oriented “Dollar Menu” to the “Dollar Menu & More” with slightly higher price points. U.S. diners’ response to that should show up in the December sales results. “McDonald’s is still struggling more mightily than their Mighty Wings,” said ITG research analyst Steve West, referring to diners’ lackluster appetite for the company’s new chicken wings. McDonald’s may have to boost promotions to improve sales, he said. McDonald’s, which has roughly seven times the sales of Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N combined, has been slower than those rivals to tempt diners with limited-time specials and promotions. Same-restaurant sales in Europe, which just edges out the United States as the top generator of revenue, rose a higher-than-expected 1.9 percent, with weakness in Germany more than offset by strength in the UK, France and Russia. But declines in Japan weighed on comparable sales in the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa region, which fell 2.3 percent. Analysts, on average, estimated a 0.7 percent decline. Sales in Japan have been weak for the past seven months. Shares of the Oakbrook, Illinois-based company were down 1.1 percent $95.73 in midday trading.

379,MCD,US STOCKS-S&P; 500 floats up to record close in quiet day on Wall St,"* Investors parse Fed speeches for taper-timing clues * Twitter shares rally after product announcements * McDonald’s November sales miss estimates, stock weighs on Dow * Dow up 0.03 pct; S&P; 500 up 0.2 pct; Nasdaq up 0.2 pct By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on Monday, with the S&P; 500 closing at a record high, as traders awaited more clues from the Federal Reserve on whether the U.S. central bank would soon begin winding down its economic stimulus. Volume was light and a volatility index fell, signaling calm among traders. The Dow industrials traded within 43.11 points from session high to intraday low, in the Dow’s tightest daily range since Aug. 17, 2012. Speeches from a number of policymakers on Monday suggested that the Fed may be closer than previously thought to trimming its $85 billion a month in bond purchases. The stimulus program  has helped drive the U.S. stock market’s rally this year. A recent string of strong economic data, however, has removed some of the market’s anxiety about the eventual ending of the Fed’s quantitative easing program. A Reuters poll showed on Monday that economists expect the Fed to begin trimming its quantitative easing program in March, but some are warming up to the idea that it will do so as early as this month or at the January meeting. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will hold its final meeting of 2013 on Dec. 17-18. “The Fed isn’t going to tighten (monetary policy) any time soon; they will taper, but only because the economy doesn’t need the stimulus anymore,” said John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.33 points or 0.03 percent, to finish at 16,025.53. The S&P; 500 gained 3.28 points or 0.18 percent, to end at 1,808.37, a record closing high.

381,MCD,US STOCKS-Wall St edges up on China data; Fed speakers ahead,"* Investors to parse Fed speeches for taper-timing clues * Slower China inflation eases worries of tighter policy * McDonald’s Nov. sales miss estimates on U.S. weakness * Dow up 0.1 pct; S&P; 500 0.2 pct; Nasdaq up 0.1 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose modestly on Monday after positive Chinese trade and inflation data, but investor enthusiasm was tempered before speeches on the economy by top Federal Reserve officials. In the wake of the unexpectedly strong November jobs report, investors will monitor central bankers’ comments for clues on when the Fed may begin to slow its stimulus. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee will hold its final meeting of 2013 on Dec. 17-18. Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, will speak at an economic outlook conference in Charlotte, North Carolina, at 12:30 p.m. (1730 GMT). St. Louis Fed Bank President James Bullard will also speak on the economy in St. Louis in the afternoon, and Dallas Fed Bank President Richard Fisher will speak in Chicago in the evening. “A lot of Fed-speak today, and likely they are going to throw some cold water on all of this and talk about tapering, getting the market prepared for that inevitability,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. “There is no question - at some point, there is tapering. Whether that is December or March or June, it’s coming. All the Fed-speak helps the market get prepared for that.” Equities received support from data that showed China’s exports beat forecasts, pointing to stabilization of the world’s second-largest economy, while annual consumer inflation unexpectedly slowed in November and served to ease market fears of any imminent policy tightening. The S&P; 500 scored its best day in nearly a month on Friday following a robust jobs report that gave traders confidence the economic recovery was gaining strength. The S&P; 500 is up nearly 27 percent for the year and is on track for its biggest annual gain since 1998. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 11.53 points or 0.07 percent, to 16,031.73. The S&P; 500 gained 3.73 points or 0.21 percent, to 1,808.82. The Nasdaq Composite  added 4.58 points or 0.11 percent, to 4,067.05. Sysco Corp jumped 12.5 percent to $38.60 and ranked as the S&P; 500’s best performer. The stock rallied after the food distributor said it would buy rival US Foods for about $3.5 billion and assume about $4.7 billion in debt to create a company with about $65 billion in annual revenue. But McDonald’s Corp curbed the Dow’s gain as it fell 1 percent to $95.79 after the fast-food restaurant chain reported weaker-than-expected global sales at established restaurants for November, hurt by a sharp drop in comparable-store sales in the United States. Abercrombie & Fitch lost 3 percent to $33.84 after the struggling teen apparel retailer said it will extend Chief Executive Mike Jeffries’ contract by at least a year after it expires in February, days after a shareholder urged the company to replace him.

386,MCD,Islanders rally to defeat Wild,"Islanders rally to defeat Wild SAINT PAUL, Minn. — New York Islanders right winger Kyle Okposo didn’t make it home for Christmas, but his pre-New Years’ visit to his hometown went better than he might have hoped. Playing before plenty of friends and family, Okposo scored twice in the third period as the Islanders rallied from a 3-0 deficit to beat the Minnesota Wild 5-4. Okposo got his 13th and 14th goals of the season just minutes apart, handing Minnesota its first home loss of the month. “It was a good one to leave the hometown fans with,” said Okposo, who played a season at the University of Minnesota before jumping to the pro ranks. “I heard about five or six cheers in the audience when I scored, but it’s nice to come home and get a win like that.” Center John Tavares, right wing Cal Clutterbuck and defenseman Thomas Hickey also scored for the Islanders (12-21-7), who trailed by three goals midway through the game but had forged a 3-3 tie less than seven minutes into the final period. Kevin Poulin had 33 saves for New York. “We changed a few things, we adjusted to a few things,” Islanders coach Jack Capuano said. “I thought our guys executed what we were trying to do and the will and the work ethic was there in the third. Obviously in the first we just stood around watching too much.” Defensemen Ryan Suter and Jonas Brodin, and right wingers Nino Niederreiter and Justin Fontaine scored for Minnesota (20-16-5), which lost its fifth game in a row. Wild goaltender Josh Harding, who had missed the team’s four previous games due to injury, returned to the net and had 26 saves. The Wild had lost just three times at home this season, and seemed stunned by the collapse. “Don’t ask me for the words because I’ve been thinking about it since the game ended and I can’t find a word to describe the feeling right now,” Wild coach Mike Yeo said. “They scored the second goal and we stopped playing. Believe me, it’s our job to find explanations, but holy cow, that’s a tough one to find an explanation for. There’s no reason, there’s no excuse for what happened tonight.” Minnesota opened the game with eight unanswered shots on goal, and the last of them reached the back of the net. After a scramble in front of Poulin, Suter corralled a loose puck 20 feet out from the crease and lifted a wrist shot into the upper left corner. It was Suter’s first goal of the season. The Wild dominated the first period, out-shooting the Islanders 16-8, but could not build on their lead until the opening shift of the second period. That’s when Brodin’s long shot from the blue line was knocked down by Poulin but trickled over the line for a 2-0 Minnesota lead. Just a short time later, Niederreiter made it 3-0, scoring his seventh of the season. Tavares answered for the Islanders with his team-leading 14th goal of the season, getting New York on the scoreboard when he slapped home a Thomas Vanek shot that had deflected off a Wild skate and was loose in the crease next to Harding. With just over a minute left in the second period, Clutterbuck pulled the Islanders back within a goal, tipping a shot by Hickey past Harding. “At some point, I feel like we stopped playing the way we should be playing, made too many hope passes and hope plays,” said Niederreiter, who was playing against his former team for the first time. “That cost us the game.” There was a brief scrap at the final buzzer involving several players from both teams, but no penalties were assessed. NOTES: Islanders C John Tavares’ time on the shelf was brief. He missed Saturday’s home loss to the Devils with a lower-body injury, snapping a streak of 246 consecutive games played, but was back in the starting lineup on Sunday. ... Wild fans gave Islanders RW Cal Clutterbuck a loud ovation in the first period when he was acknowledged on the video board. Clutterbuck played five seasons in Minnesota and was a fan favorite. He was traded to the Islanders last summer for RW Nino Niederreiter. ... Wild D Ryan Suter’s first-period goal was his first since April 7 last season at Columbus. He had gone 50 games without finding the back of the net. ... Sunday evening’s sellout crowd of 18,851 at the Xcel Energy Center included the 10 millionth fan to attend a Wild home game. Since their NHL debut with a preseason game on Sept. 29, 2000, the Wild have hosted 494 regular-season games, 36 preseason games and 15 playoff games. ... The Islanders return to the East Coast and will play the Bruins in Boston on Tuesday evening. Minnesota, in the midst of a four-game homestand, hosts the St. Louis Blues on Tuesday night.",12302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/hkn-islanders-wild-writethru/islanders-rally-to-defeat-wild-idUSMTZE9CULPBODN20131230
387,MCD,"McDonald's gets fewer visits in quarter, expects weak January","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales at established restaurants on Thursday as fewer diners frequented the fast-food chain, and warned that sales would again fall short of analysts’ expectations in January. The world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue has reported disappointing sales for five straight quarters, hurt by self-inflicted operational stumbles, weak demand and intensified competition from resurgent rivals such as Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N. Indeed, efforts by Chief Executive Don Thompson to shore up earnings in the 18 months since he took the top job at the company - by tweaking menus and changing management - have not borne fruit. The pressure is on him to boost McDonald’s share price as well. The stock is up just 7 percent since Thompson became chief executive on July 1, 2012, well behind the 27-percent jump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index, of which McDonald’s is a component. Analysts predicted that investors would give Thompson a bit more time to turn the company’s fortunes before they begin to advocate for big changes. “If McDonald’s doesn’t fix itself by the end of 2014, the drumbeat of activism will grow,” Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Howard Penney told Reuters. On a conference call with analysts, McDonald’s executives said they “over-complicated” menus last year. They vowed to re-engage customers this year with plans that include customizing sandwiches, emphasizing breakfast and coffee, and increasing marketing via mobile phones and other devices. Some critics have called on McDonald’s to simplify operations by downsizing its menu. Penney warned that the company’s new plan to customize sandwiches could further slow service. Global sales at McDonald’s restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.1 percent during the fourth quarter, due in part to severe winter weather in the United States. Quarterly results were overshadowed by McDonald’s forecast for “relatively flat” January global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months. The January forecast “stands out as a healthy (same-store sales) miss,” Wells Fargo restaurant analyst Jeff Farmer said in a client note. Analysts, on average, estimate a 2.4 percent gain in January. Analysts were optimistic that McDonald’s sales trends would improve in January, largely because the company turned in lukewarm results in January 2013. McDonald’s has about seven times the sales of Wendy’s and Burger King combined, but has had less success than those rivals in tempting diners with limited-time specials and promotions. Hyped new products, such as Mighty Wings, flopped. Beyond that, the addition of lattes, smoothies, salads and wraps have slowed McDonald’s service in a business where hyper-competitive drive-thru times are measured in seconds. McDonald’s also switched its value-oriented “Dollar Menu” to the “Dollar Menu & More” in November with slightly higher prices. Executives said the heavily marketed new menu met internal performance targets, but didn’t appear to draw more customers. Closely watched global same-restaurant sales in December were down 1.2 percent, versus a 0.6 percent gain expected by analysts polled by Consensus Metrix. The 3.8 percent drop in the United States was the biggest shortfall - analysts expected a decline of just 0.6 percent - but other regions also missed. The Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region posted an unexpected 2.1 percent decline and Europe’s 0.5 percent gain was about half what analysts expected. Fourth-quarter net income was flat at $1.40 billion, or $1.40 per share. Total revenue for the company, known for its crispy french fries and Big Mac hamburgers, grew 2 percent to $7.09 billion. Analysts on average were expecting the company to earn $1.39 per share on revenue of $7.11 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Still, shares ticked up 0.2 percent to $95.11 in afternoon trading.

390,MCD,McDonald's global comparable sales decline,"Jan 23 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s global sales at established restaurants missed analysts’ expectations, hurt by fewer customers visits partly due to severe winter weather in the United States. McDonald’s shares fell nearly 1 percent in premarket trading. The world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue, known for its crispy french fries and Big Mac hamburgers, reported net income of $1.40 billion, or $1.40 per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. That compares with $1.40 billion, or $1.38 per share, a year earlier. Global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.1 percent in the quarter. Analysts on average had expected a rise of 0.5 percent, according to privately held industry estimates provider Consensus Metrix. Total revenue rose 2 percent to $7.09 billion.

396,MCD,Wall St Week Ahead-Will U.S. stock buyers beat back the bear?,"NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - After the S&P; 500’s first weekly gain in a month, investors will see next week whether the U.S. stock market’s rally of the last two days is the shape of better things to come - or if this year’s weakness will turn into a full-fledged correction. The S&P; 500 rose 0.8 percent for the week, scoring a weekly gain for the first time since early January. The benchmark index closed above its 14-day moving average on Friday, the first time it traded above that level since Jan. 23. The 2.6 percent gain for Thursday and Friday marked the S&P; 500’s best two-day performance in four months. That rally helped Wall Street recover some ground from the latest slide, which had pushed the benchmark index down as much as 6 percent from its record closing high set on Jan. 15. Wall Street defines a stock market correction as a drop of at least 10 percent from the previous high. A bear market is a plunge of 20 percent from a previous peak. The recent selloff has created some severely oversold conditions that have “now blossomed into buy signals, but there is still a much larger intermediate-term bearishness in place,” Larry McMillan, president of McMillan Analysis Corp in Morristown, New Jersey, said in a note to clients. “The buy signals may generate a rally back to and through the 20-day moving average. But for anything more than that, the intermediate-term sell signals have to be reversed.” The S&P; 500 fell 3.6 percent in January, its worst monthly loss since May 2012. Its 20-day moving average is currently at 1,804.25. In another check of the U.S. economy’s health, January retail sales will be in focus. The data could offer more evidence that the economy lost some momentum at the start of the first quarter. On Friday, nonfarm payrolls data showed job creation in the United States slowed sharply over the past two months, raising the prospect that the economy may be losing strength. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will be in the spotlight as she testifies before U.S. lawmakers next week in her first public comments on monetary policy and the economy after taking the reins at the U.S. central bank. She will appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday and the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. Yellen, a strong supporter of the Fed’s easy-money policies,  will be responsible for ramping down a huge bond-buying program and, later, raising interest rates and shrinking the Fed’s swollen balance sheet. The Commerce Department is expected to report on Thursday that retail sales were flat in January, held down by a drop in receipts at auto dealerships, after rising 0.2 percent in December. Even after stripping out autos, retail sales are seen barely rising. “That retail number is actually important because it includes the January gift card numbers, so that completes the Christmas picture,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, in New York. On Thursday, a group of nine retailers that report comparable monthly sales posted a 3.6 percent rise for January, below the 4.9 percent pace a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters. The data suggested that January was a tough end to the most competitive holiday season for U.S. retailers since the 2007-2009 recession. Next week’s economic calendar will include weekly jobless claims on Thursday and January’s industrial output on Friday. The preliminary February reading on consumer sentiment will also be released on Friday by Thomson Reuters and the University of Michigan. On Monday, McDonald’s Corp will report January sales. Last month, the company reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales at established restaurants as fewer diners frequented the fast-food chain. McDonald’s warned that sales would again fall short of analysts’ expectations in January. On the earnings front, companies ranging from Sprint Corp  to Cisco Systems Inc, Deere & Co, PepsiCo Inc and MetLife Inc will report their results. Thomson Reuters data showed that of the 343 companies in the S&P; 500 that had reported earnings through Friday morning, 67.9 percent have topped Wall Street’s expectations, slightly above the 67 percent beat rate for the past four quarters and ahead of the 63 percent rate since 1994.

The Nasdaq was boosted by strength in large-cap tech and pharma names, but most market participants took a wait-and-see attitude ahead of the testimony, looking for confirmation that the Fed would not change its schedule for ending its support for the economy. The U.S. central bank’s accommodative monetary policies have been credited with fueling the market’s steep gains in 2013, and are expected to keep a floor under equity prices for as long as they continue. The Fed first announced a slowing in the bond-buying program in December, followed by another one in January. If it changes the pace of tapering - and uncertainty in emerging markets and the weak January payrolls have raised the odds of that to some - it may raise concerns that the economy is still not strong enough to strengthen on its own. “We’re hoping to hear Yellen strike a balance where she recognizes that the recovery is fragile, but not so much that the Fed changes its mind, which would be too premature of a signal to send,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in New York. Yellen’s prepared remarks will be available before the market opens on Tuesday. She will also participate in a question-and-answer session with U.S. lawmakers after the open. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 7.71 points, or 0.05 percent, at 15,801.79. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was up 2.82 points, or 0.16 percent, at 1,799.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 22.31 points, or 0.54 percent, at 4,148.17. The S&P; 500 is coming off its best two-day performance in four months, which capped the index’s first weekly gain in the past four. Those gains were preceded by the index’s sharpest pullback in months. “Last week investors received a wake-up call that 2014 is unlikely to be like 2013 in terms of the return or the smoothness of the ride,” said Grohowski, who helps oversee $185 billion in client assets. “We’re still digesting last week’s volatility, but investor sentiment is now neutral or negative, which is a positive for markets.” McDonald’s Corp reported a decline in U.S. January same-store sales, though global sales were above expectations.

The benchmark S&P; 500 rallied Friday for the index’s first weekly gain in the past four, as investors looked past a disappointing payrolls report.

That was above the analysts’ average estimate of a rise of 0.7 percent, according to Consensus Metrix.

In a recent call with analysts, McDonald’s Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson vowed to “create more of a coffee culture through high-quality McCafe products” as well as to double-down on breakfast and sales of food priced around $1 — in a bid to bolster sales. Once or twice a week, Tremblay makes a slight detour from his morning commute to pick up coffee and a sausage McMuffin with egg or a sausage burrito. He has bought the company’s flavored coffees, but never orders the espresso drinks made from pricey McCafe machines that McDonald’s franchisees installed to compete with Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O). Tremblay, a production artist for an animation firm, is happy when his favorite items are on sale - but he and other customers say that discounts are not enough to change their morning routines. Mel Yu, a 32-year-old automotive industry consultant from Grand Blanc, Michigan, still goes to McDonald’s three to four times a week — but that is down significantly from a decade ago, when McDonald’s was just about the only place to grab a quick morning meal. These days, breakfast competition is fierce. Starbucks is introducing new pastries, fast-food chains Burger King BKW.N and Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O) have come on strong with food and drinks, and bakery chain Panera Bread PNRA.O has rapidly expanded. McDonald’s owners in Yu’s area have been couponing and matching discounts from competitors. Still, Yu said that has not increased the frequency of his visits to the Golden Arches: “I’m going there anyhow.” McDonald’s did not immediately respond to requests for comment via telephone or email. McDonald’s on Monday said U.S. sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 3.3 percent in January - more than twice as steep as the drop that analysts polled by Consensus Metrix expected. McDonald’s blamed the frigid cold and snow that hit large parts of the United States, but analysts said McDonald’s domestic patrons continue to be pinched by the slow economy. It is a trend playing out across the industry. McDonald’s and other restaurants that cater to the financially strapped low-to-middle income masses — including Darden Restaurant Inc’s (DRI.N) Olive Garden and Red Lobster chains — are struggling to bring in sales. At the same time, Starbucks, Panera, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) and Darden’s Capital Grille steak house, which cater to somewhat wealthier diners, are outperforming. McDonald’s was the undisputed leader in the U.S. quick-service breakfast category with 19 percent market share in 2013, according to Nielsen Co consumer data firm Scarborough. Its closest rivals last year were Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts, each with 7 percent market share. “When you’re No. 1, you’ve got one direction to go and that’s down. Everybody’s got a target on your back,” Investment Technology Group restaurant analyst Steve West said. Some analysts expect investors to give Thompson, McDonald’s CEO who took the helm in July 2012, most of this year to turn the ship. Thompson championed the McCafe push during his tenure as president of McDonald’s USA from 2006 to 2010. That program required franchisees to renovate restaurants to create space for equipment, such as an espresso machine that cost between $10,000 and $15,000 per restaurant. The McCafe expansion — which also included blended fruit smoothies and other drinks — is widely viewed as a success. While regular coffee sales are reported to be brisk, some franchisees have complained in surveys that sales of espresso drinks fall far short of covering the cost of the high-maintenance machines that crank out lattes and mochas with the press of a button. Howard Penney, restaurant analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management, said McCafe is at the heart of McDonald’s operational woes. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Penney says the McCafe business has been slowing down service and that the recent roll-outs of too many new food products and limited-time offers have only exaggerated the problem. For now, McDonald’s is focusing on making its food preparation more efficient. It has called on restaurant operators to install a $25,000 to $50,000 “high density table” that stores sandwich toppings and other items. Executives say that new equipment will help workers turn out sandwiches and other food faster. If that investment does not boost sales at established restaurants in the second half of 2014, Penney said McDonald’s would be forced to look at McCafe. “McCafe is a sacred cow right now,” Penney said.

405,MCD,COLUMN-Boring might be better for fund investors in 2014,"By John Wasik CHICAGO, Feb 18 (Reuters) - With U.S. stocks doing a stutter-step after a five-year bull run, a shift into low-volatility funds might give you a little more traction if the market retrenches. Low or “minimum” volatility funds have become more popular since the 2008 meltdown. Buying mostly defensive stocks with high dividends and modest price variations, they represent an $11 billion market for moderately risk-averse investors. The most popular fund in this category, the PowerShares S&P; 500 Low-Volatility ETF, holds more than $3 billion in assets. It owns brand-name stocks like McDonald’s Corp  and Johnson & Johnson, along with lesser-known companies like Sigma-Aldrich Corp. The fund, which charges 0.25 percent for annual management expenses, was up 14 percent for the year ended Feb. 12. A similar fund is the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF, which with slightly more than $2 billion in assets is a runner-up in terms of size in this group. It holds nearly half of its portfolio in consumer defensive, healthcare and financial services stocks like AT&T; Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and United Parcel Service Inc. The fund charges slightly less in annual expenses - 0.15 percent - and gained about 16 percent in the year through Feb. 12. But both it and the PowerShares ETF are lagging the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index, which is up 22 percent for that period. Although it is too early to tell, low-volatility funds might have a distinct advantage if the bull cycle has reached or surpassed its peak. If corporate earnings falter or global economies slow, the market may tilt toward value and dividend-rich stocks. To date, though, the low-volatility advantage has yet to appear. Both the S&P; 500 and low-volatility shares are closely tracking each other, down slightly more than 1 percent year to date as of Feb. 12. Despite the desire to time the top of a bull market, it is tough to make an exit from growth stocks into high-dividend shares. Market peaks are notoriously difficult to discern. The most pressing question for a long-term investor is whether to tilt more toward value than growth. Until this year, growth stocks have had their run of the roost, but value may dominate if fear stalks the market. It is typical for low-volatility funds to bulk up on boring, dividend-rich sectors like consumer durable, healthcare and utilities. The PowerShares fund, for example, has nearly half of its portfolio in those three groups. Both it and the iShares fund have yields north of 2 percent, which reflect the higher payouts of those kinds of companies. Yet what appears to be a virtue can be a disadvantage, particularly if the bull has room to run and the market will still favor growth stocks. By their very staid nature, low-volatility funds may not outpace the S&P; 500, which rose 32 percent last year with dividends reinvested, compared with 25 percent for the iShares fund. Instead of trying to guess where the market is going and reacting week to week, a dividend-growth strategy might prove potent in the long run. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index ETF, which I hold in my 401(k), lagged the S&P; 500 by only about 1 percentage point over the past three years. The Vanguard fund, which focuses on companies that consistently raise their dividends, is slightly more diversified than the other low-volatility funds I have mentioned. Its portfolio is more spread out among mega-, large- and medium-size companies with holdings like Abbott Laboratories, Procter & Gamble Co and PepsiCo Inc. It costs only 0.10 percent annually to own and was up 16 percent for the year ended Feb. 12. Companies paying lower but growing dividends may also be bargains, Matt Freund, chief investment officer of USAA Funds in San Antonio, stated in a recent market commentary. “Companies increasing their dividend payments are making a commitment to the market,” Freund said. “They are telling investors that their business is strong enough to generate the free cash needed to pay higher dividends in the future.” Whatever path you take, do not confuse low-volatility funds with no volatility. All low-volatility stock funds will still react to market swoons. The Vanguard fund, for example, was down more than 3 percent year to date through Feb. 12, compared with a 1.3 percent decline for the S&P; 500. Concentrating too much on defensive stocks will certainly create a drag on performance if growth still dominates, but that may not be a bad thing if you want to focus on total return over the long haul.",2182014,http://www.reuters.com/article/column-wasik-volatility/column-boring-might-be-better-for-fund-investors-in-2014-idUSL2N0LI1GH20140218
406,MCD,Watch for companies to claim 'Jack Frost ate our profits',"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Sick of hearing Americans complain about the winter weather? Too bad. Because the corporate kvetching has only just begun. While meteorologists say warmer temperatures finally are on the way, savvy investors know a cold front could still be looming when it comes to the profits of publicly traded U.S. companies. Indeed, if history is any guide, CEOs will still be moaning about the recent cold snap well into spring, when they report first-quarter earnings. Why? Because the coldest winter in a quarter century provides them with a handy — and reasonably plausible — excuse for any results that fall short of expectations. For some companies, such as those in transport-dependent businesses, the explanations may be valid. For others, it may well be a case of the (chilly) dog ate their homework. After Hurricane Katrina slammed into the U.S. Gulf Coast in 2005, a host of companies with not especially big exposures to the affected region - including Avon Products Inc., Books-A-Million Inc and Tempur-Pedic International Inc, now a unit of Tempur Sealy International Inc - blamed the disaster for poorer-than-expected results. When their rivals did just fine despite the hurricane, analysts cried foul. The latest weather-related claims have begun to come in. Recent U.S. economic indicators, including unexpected drops in retail sales and manufacturing output in January, showed the deep freeze is having an impact. Last week, McDonald’s Corp partly pinned a fall in January sales at its established U.S. restaurants on the frigid cold and snow, while vitamin and nutritional supplements retailer GNC Holdings Inc warned that its first quarter results would fall short of expectations because of bad weather. Earlier this month, Ford Motor Co, CSX Corp and United Continental Holdings Inc have also warned that the severe cold weather is wreaking havoc on their operations in the first quarter. Analysts say experience shows it is inevitable some companies will use the severe temperatures and serial snow and ice storms as a cover to conceal problems, such as management missteps and other internal shortcomings. “While managers will be quick to use weather as an excuse for soft earnings ... most sectors of the economy aren’t impacted,” said Matthew Patten, the president, Cutler Investment Counsel LLC. To be sure, this winter will go down in the record books as one of the coldest in recent history. “The last one that was this cold was the winter of 1993, 1994 - and this one is edging that one out,” said Dale Mohler, a senior meteorologist with Accuweather, the private weather forecasting company. “This is something that comes around maybe once every 25, 30 years.” Temperatures across a vast area of the United States, stretching east from the Great Plains through the Midwest and into the northern Appalachians, have been running 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3.3 to 5.5 degrees Celsius) below normal for two-and-a-half months straight. The weather clearly has discouraged some consumers from heading out to shop. U.S. retail sales fell 0.4 percent in January, led by a tumble in automobile sales and categories such as clothing, furniture stores and restaurants that depend on foot traffic. But the impact of the cold snap has extended beyond the retail industry. A number of U.S. companies, including Ingersoll Rand Plc and Emerson Electric Co, have complained about transportation and logistical problems that the snow and sub-zero temperatures have triggered. “We’re all losing days of production, we’re losing days of shipments,” Emerson Chief Executive Officer David Farr told an investor conference last Thursday. U.S. airlines have been especially hard hit, with flight cancellations and delays soaring. In January alone, nearly 40,000 U.S. flights were canceled and another 136,000 delayed, according to FlightAware.com - four times the number affected by weather in any of three previous Januaries. As a result, most big airlines, including Delta Air Lines Inc, American Airlines Group Inc and United Continental have waived change fees and relaxed rebooking rules for customers who had tickets to fly through storm-hit airports. United Continental said the storms and sub-zero temperatures cost United $60 million in January alone. They “were among the worst weather events in our history,” said company spokesman Luke Punzenberger. Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics, points out that the prolonged bad weather has been good news for some industries. For example, it has boosted demand for the power that publicly traded utilities generate, as well as for the industries that supply the power plants. Campbell Soup Co, the world’s largest soup maker, reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, helped in part by the cold weather. But Miles Yourman, a portfolio analyst with Knightsbridge Asset Management LLC, warned investors not to assume the weather will have a positive effect just because a company is in one of the industries that stand to benefit. He cited Chesapeake Energy Corp, one of the stocks in the Knightsbridge portfolio, as an example. “The cold weather has obviously been very good for natural gas prices, but on the other hand it’s interfered with their production. So they haven’t enjoyed the benefit,” he said. And weather-related downturns, like the cold weather itself, may soon melt away. A company like motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc may see a drop in foot traffic to its showrooms in the current quarter, but wind up benefiting in the next few quarters, Yourman said. “After being cooped up after a long winter, that’s when you really want to go out and buy a new bike to get the wind in your face,” he said.

408,MCD,McDonald's big shot pushed DePaul past Seton Hall,"McDonald’s big shot pushed DePaul past Seton Hall ROSEMONT, Ill. — It may have been Durrell McDonald’s birthday on Tuesday but the DePaul guard ended up delivering the gift. The Blue Demons sophomore hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 2:55 to play as DePaul broke a 10-game losing streak with a 65-60 Big East victory over the Seton Hall Pirates at Allstate Arena. McDonald, now 20, connected just as the shot clock expired to give the hosts a 61-58 lead. “I looked right at the shot clock and as soon as I saw (the time left) I’ve got to shoot,” McDonald said. “I thought it was just confidence. When the game is tight you can’t think about the game too much because that’s when you start not playing your game.” Even the opposition was impressed. “He hit a tough shot, he’s a good shooter,” said Seton Hall coach Kevin Willard. “With the shot clock running down we challenged it and that must have been a 35-footer and he made it.” Guard Brandon Young led a balanced attack with 19 points as the Blue Demons (11-18, 3-13) won for the first time in six weeks and escaped going 0-for-February. McDonald and guard Billy Garrett Jr. each scored 15 points apiece while forward Sandi Marcius added 10. “It started in practice today,” McDonald said. “We all just stayed strictly focused and played our game and came out with the W.” Forward Fuquan Edwin scored 21 points despite a sprained thumb to lead the Pirates (14-14, 5-9), who lost their second straight and fifth in six games. Guard Jaren Sina added 12 points. DePaul led 38-29 at halftime, but Seton Hall opened with a 13-4 run and tied the game at 42 on Edwin’s fast-break layup with 15:10 to play. Edwin and Sina then hit back-to-back 3-pointers over a 58-second span as Seton Hall opened a 50-44 lead with 12:50 to play. DePaul rallied over the next four minutes to claim a 52-50 lead on McDonald’s 3-pointer. From there, the game offered two lead changes and three ties until McDonald’s shot clock-beating 3-pointer put DePaul up for good. DePaul trailed early, then used a 10-0 run over a span of 2:17 to open a 16-11 lead less than seven minutes into the game. The Blue Demons later had a pair of nine-point leads, the second coming at the 6:30 mark when forward Forest Robinson’s 3-pointer made it 29-20. DePaul’s lead hit double-digits with 90 seconds left as Marcius’ layup opened a 36-26 lead. Marcius, who closed the half with 10 points, added a put back with two seconds showing to make it 38-29. The Blue Demons were 15 of 21 (71.4 percent) from the field in the first half, including four of eight from beyond the arc. Edwin paced the Pirates with 12 first-half points. “I thought our effort was okay,” Willard said. “I thought we got a little confused defensively. I wasn’t a little shocked that we weren’t a little more focused on the defensive end. But they came out and made some tough shots early ... and Young got them going.” NOTES: DePaul G Brandon Young needed just two points to become the sixth in school history with 1,800 points. ... The Blue Demons’ 96-94 overtime loss to Marquette last Saturday snapped a run of 13 straight wins when they scored 80 or more points. ... A career-high 26-point effort in that game helped DePaul G Billy Garrett Jr. land Big East Rookie of the Week honors for the fifth time this season. ... Seton Hall G/F Fuquan Edwin landed on the Big East honor roll this week after averaging 16.5 points in two wins. ... The Pirates, who beat the Blue Demons 86-69 on Jan. 25 in South Orange, N.J., lead the all-time series 10-8 and have won seven of the last nine meetings. ...

409,MCD,"Pussy Riot members attacked with green paint, rubbish","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Two members of the Russian protest group Pussy Riot were attacked by a group of men who poured rubbish and bright green paint over them and shouted obscenities at them at a McDonald’s restaurant. An online video, uploaded by the group on Thursday, shows at least three men attacking Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, shouting “(Go) to America!” and shooting paint into their faces from syringes in the city of Nizhny Novgorod. “It hurts! Why are you doing this?” Tolokonnikova says, with green stains on her face and hands. “You don’t have the right to hurt me. Please don’t do that to anyone anymore.” Alyokhina said she suffered head injuries and Tolokonnikova had chemical burns. The men wore patriotic symbols - so-called St George ribbons which commemorate the victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two. Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina spent nearly two years in prison for performing a “punk prayer” in a protest against President Vladimir Putin in a Russian Orthodox church in Moscow. Celebrated in the West as activists who fight for freedom of speech, they are disliked by many people in Russia’s socially conservative provinces, where support for Putin is strong. They were freed in December, and went to Sochi on the Black Sea coast last month to film an anti-Putin video while the city was hosting the Winter Olympics. They were briefly detained by police in Sochi and beaten with a whip by Cossacks, who were reinforcing security during the Games. Alyokhina said on Twitter that she and Tolokonnikova were attacked on their way to a local penal colony where she served her prison term. They said after their release from jail that they would fight for prisoners’ rights. Tolokonnikova blamed local police for the attack. The police said they were investigating the case and declined to comment on the allegations. “They can say it was a provocation by the law enforcement authorities. The law enforcement authorities can say it was a PR-stunt by Pussy Riot. We don’t deal with rumors”, a police spokeswoman said.

410,MCD,McDonald's U.S. sales continue to struggle in February,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) on Monday reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales for February, hurt again by slow business in the United States. The world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue said worldwide sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.3 percent last month. That was below analysts’ average estimate for a fall of 0.1 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. U.S. same-restaurant sales fell 1.4 percent, worse than the 0.6 percent decline that analysts had forecast. McDonald’s Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen said in a press release that the unchanged global comparable sales so far this year “will pressure margins” in the first quarter. McDonald’s has reported nearly two years of turbulent sales at established U.S. restaurants amid sluggish economic growth, increased competition and internal missteps that have complicated its menus and slowed service. That performance is heaping pressure on Don Thompson, the chief executive of McDonald’s since July 2012, who will face new challenges this year. Beef prices are hovering near record highs and expected to keep climbing. Labor costs also are increasing: several states have raised their minimum wage this year. Thompson said in a statement that McDonald’s is “intent on improving our business performance.” McDonald’s said it is trying to draw more customers by improving customer service and menu changes. McDonald’s is doubling down on breakfast and coffee to defend its No. 1 position in the United States as Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) debuts new breakfast sandwiches and Yum Brands’ (YUM.N) Taco Bell chain gets into the game with food like waffle tacos. McDonald’s again blamed the intense cold and snow that hit large parts of the country, but analysts have been quick to point out that McDonald’s less-affluent U.S. patrons are still getting pinched by sluggish job growth and stagnant wages. In Europe, the company’s biggest market by revenue, restaurant sales last month rose 0.6 percent. Sales were down 2.6 percent in the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region. Analysts looked for Europe to be down 0.1 percent and for APMEA to drop 1.1 percent. Sales in Britain and France led the way in Europe, while poor business in Japan weighed down sales in Asia. McDonald’s shares were down 0.4 percent Monday morning. ",3102014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-sales/mcdonalds-u-s-sales-continue-to-struggle-in-february-idUSBREA290LY20140310
411,MCD,US STOCKS-Wall Street edges lower after record; Boeing drags,"* China trade data weak * McDonald’s February same-restaurant sales fall * Boeing finds cracks in wings of Dreamliners in production * Indexes off: Dow 0.41 pct, S&P; 0.24 pct, Nasdaq 0.15 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged modestly lower on Monday, and the S&P; 500 held near record highs, as investors largely shrugged off unexpectedly weak data in China. China’s exports unexpectedly tumbled 18.1 percent in February, against expectations for a 6.8 percent rise, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy, despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide. “We did shrug off the (China data), almost as if was a non-event,” said Peter Kenny, chief executive of Clearpool Group in New York. “I don’t think it’s disruptive to the way people are looking at China as an economy that has lost some of its hyperbolic move and that is almost welcome.” Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 2.6 percent to $31.35 as signs of a slowing China sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P; materials index lost 0.4 percent. Sunday marked the five-year anniversary of the S&P;’s 12-year low of 676.53, when the U.S. economy suffered its worst recession in seven decades. “That five-year anniversary has given market investors a sense of pause rather than a sense of enthusiasm because there is still this lingering fear that resides in the approach people have with the market - have we come too far, too fast? Are valuations justified?” said Kenny. In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest that some weakness in the labor market was only temporary, which suggested the Fed will stay on course in winding down its stimulus measures. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 67.43 points, or 0.41 percent, to 16,385.29, the S&P; 500 lost 4.46 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,873.58 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 6.551 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,329.672. McDonald’s Corp slipped 0.3 percent to $95.25 after the hamburger chain reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales at established restaurants for February, with competition and bad weather battering U.S. sales. Boeing Co shares lost 1.9 percent to $126.10 as the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P; 500, after the plane maker said on Friday that “hairline cracks” had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company’s newest jet. Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an “unprecedented aviation mystery,” a senior official said on Monday. Chiquita Brands and Irish rival Fyffes, Europe’s largest distributor, have struck an all-stock merger deal to create the world’s biggest banana supplier. Chiquita shares jumped 14.6 percent to $12.42.

412,MCD,UPDATE 2-McDonald's U.S. sales continue to struggle in February,"By Phil Wahba March 10 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp on Monday reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales for February, hurt again by slow business in the United States. The world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue said worldwide sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.3  percent last month. That was below analysts’ average estimate for a fall of 0.1 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. U.S. same-restaurant sales fell 1.4 percent, worse than the 0.6 percent decline that analysts had forecast. McDonald’s Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen said in a press release that the unchanged global comparable sales so far this year “will pressure margins” in the first quarter. McDonald’s has reported nearly two years of turbulent sales at established U.S. restaurants amid sluggish economic growth, increased competition and internal missteps that have complicated its menus and slowed service. That performance is heaping pressure on Don Thompson, the chief executive of McDonald’s since July 2012, who will face new challenges this year. Beef prices are hovering near record highs and expected to keep climbing. Labor costs also are increasing: several states have raised their minimum wage this year. Thompson said in a statement that McDonald’s is “intent on improving our business performance.” McDonald’s said it is trying to draw more customers by improving customer service and menu changes. McDonald’s is doubling down on breakfast and coffee to defend its No. 1 position in the United States as Starbucks Corp  debuts new breakfast sandwiches and Yum Brands’  Taco Bell chain gets into the game with food like waffle tacos. McDonald’s again blamed the intense cold and snow that hit large parts of the country, but analysts have been quick to point out that McDonald’s less-affluent U.S. patrons are still getting pinched by sluggish job growth and stagnant wages. In Europe, the company’s biggest market by revenue, restaurant sales last month rose 0.6 percent. Sales were down 2.6 percent in the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region. Analysts looked for Europe to be down 0.1 percent and for APMEA to drop 1.1 percent. Sales in Britain and France led the way in Europe, while poor business in Japan weighed down sales in Asia. McDonald’s shares were down 0.4 percent Monday morning.",3102014,http://www.reuters.com/article/mcdonalds-sales/update-2-mcdonalds-u-s-sales-continue-to-struggle-in-february-idUSL2N0M70PB20140310

414,MCD,McDonald's hit by worker lawsuits claiming it steals wages,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp workers in three U.S. states filed lawsuits this week against the fast-food chain, alleging it is stealing wages by forcing them to work off the clock, by cheating them out of overtime and by denying them rest breaks. The seven suits were announced on Thursday by the employees’ lawyers and were filed Wednesday and Thursday in New York, California and Michigan. McDonald’s spokeswoman Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem said the company is reviewing the allegations in the suits. “McDonald’s and our independent franchisees are committed to undertaking a comprehensive investigation of the allegations and will take any necessary actions as they apply to our respective organizations,” Barker Sa Shekhem said in a statement. In Michigan, two lawsuits were filed against McDonald’s and two Detroit-area franchise owners by workers claiming they were told to come to work, only to be told to wait without pay until there were enough customers in the restaurant. In three lawsuits brought in California, the workers claim they were not paid for all hours worked, were cheated out of overtime payments, and were not allowed to take meal and rest breaks they were legally entitled to. In New York, a suit filed in federal court by several McDonald’s workers said they were not reimbursed for the time and cost of cleaning their uniforms. “These are the workers whom McDonald’s is deliberately and systematically denying pay,” Joseph Sellers, co-counsel in the lawsuits filed in California and New York, said on a media call. “These suits have been filed to stop the widespread wage theft.” The lawyers are seeking class-action status in some of the suits against McDonald’s, saying employees were afraid to file the suits individually for fear of reprisals. Five of the lawsuits are aimed at restaurant franchisees as well as the company. McDonald’s owns 10 percent of its restaurants. McDonald’s has reported nearly two years of turbulent sales at established U.S. restaurants amid sluggish economic growth, increased competition and internal missteps that have complicated its menus and slowed service. U.S. sales at McDonald’s restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.2 percent last year. McDonald’s shares were down 1.2 percent at $97.48 on Thursday afternoon.

418,MCD,"New York McDonald's owner to pay $500,000 to settle worker claims","March 18 (Reuters) - The owner of seven franchised McDonald’s restaurants in Manhattan agreed to pay almost $500,000 to workers who were required to work “off the clock” and were subject to other practices that violated state labor laws, New York state’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, said on Tuesday. The settlement is the second from an ongoing New York investigation into alleged labor law violations at numerous fast-food chains and comes a week after McDonald’s workers in three U.S. states sued the world’s biggest restaurant company over alleged wage theft and other pay issues. U.S. restaurant and retail workers, many of whom earn minimum wage and live below the poverty line, have helped spark a national debate over income inequality. Their efforts are backed by U.S. organized labor, which has experienced plummeting membership in recent decades. Schneiderman said the settlement with McDonald’s Corp  New York City franchisee Richard Cisneros included damages and interest and will benefit more than 1,600 workers. “I value my employees - and it is important to me that they be paid correctly,” Cisneros said in an emailed statement. Cisneros, whose McDonald’s restaurants are each operated by a separate corporation, said his companies had corrected “mistakes” and are now fully compliant. The New York attorney general’s investigation found that from 2007 through mid 2013, Cisneros’s restaurants at times required some of their 700 cashiers to work “off-the-clock,” or without pay, before or after their shifts. Some cashiers also were required to use their own money to cover cash register shortages. Other violations included failure to give employees an extra hour of pay at minimum wage when they worked more than 10 hours in a day, as mandated by state law. The restaurant operator also failed to either launder or to pay for the cost of cleaning employees uniforms, as required under New York state law. In December, New York’s attorney general got 25 workers at a New York City Domino’s Pizza Inc franchise reinstated after they were fired for speaking against alleged labor abuses.

419,MCD,Singer Audra McDonald returns to Broadway as Billie Holiday,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Five-time Tony Award-winning singer Audra McDonald, just finishing a 30-city tour, is heading back to Broadway next week as legendary American jazz singer Billie Holiday in “Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar & Grill.” The musical is based on one of Holiday’s last performances, when she was in poor health, singing in a small, intimate Philadelphia bar before a handful of people just a month before she died in 1959. The show debuted off-Broadway nearly 30 years ago. It begins a 10-week run at the Circle in the Square theatre with previews on March 25 and opening night on April 13. With her sultry voice and distinctive style, Holiday is considered one of the greatest jazz singers ever. She was nicknamed “Lady Day” by saxophonist Lester Young. “Lady Day at Emerson’s Bar & Grill” depicts Holiday’s life through more than a dozen songs such as “God Bless the Child,” “Crazy He Calls Me,” “Strange Fruit” and “What a Little Moonlight Can Do,” and reminiscences with the audience. “With Billie Holiday, everybody has a close personal relationship with her music, her artistry,” said McDonald, 43, who is returning to Broadway for the first time since winning a best actress Tony in 2012 for “The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess.” “Everyone in a way feels like they know her because she has touched whoever listens to her,” said the three-time Emmy- nominated actress, who also appeared in NBC’s “The Sound of Music Live!” and had a recurring role in the TV medical drama “Private Practice.” Despite an impoverished birth and shattered childhood, Holiday’s extraordinary vocal talent propelled her to stardom in a racially divided America in the 1930s and 1940s. She died a poor drug addict at the age of 44. McDonald admits to being intimidated by playing Holiday. “I think I’ll be able to do this role for the run of the show and have researched about as much as I possibly can about her and still not ever fully, fully understand her. There are so many contradictions in her, so much life in her,” she said. Director Lonny Price (“Master Harold ... and the Boys” and “A Class Act”) worked with McDonald in the 2007 revival of the musical “110 in the Shade.” They have been developing the “Lady Day” musical for more than two years. “The play is a great exploration of the African-American experience in the first half of the last century. Billie Holiday had a very Dickensian kind of upbringing. She was raped at 10, worked in a whorehouse, had terrible addiction issues and was sent to jail for a year cold turkey to get off drugs,” he explained. Price was intrigued by the dichotomy of the great star, who influenced so many people and was loved by so many, and who had a terrible life yet was able to survive through her music. “She loved to sing, and that was the thing that really grounded her,” he said. “I have also been attracted to people who survive without self pity. She was that person.” To capture Holiday’s essence and that memorable performance, the audience will be taken back to 1959 - to that Philadelphia bar that playwright Lanie Robertson found so haunting when a lover who had been there described it to him. “I carried that for a long time and began listening to her music,” said Robertson, whose plays include “Back County Crimes” and “Nasty Little Secrets.” “I thought that I heard, almost sub rosa (privately) in the music, the joy and pain of her life and (had) to put that on the stage in one performance, that she is trying to get through the night.” Robertson believes that despite her drug addiction, alcoholism and abusive relationships, Holiday was never a victim. “She was triumphant in her music, in her insistence on singing the way she felt and feeling the song in order to sing it,” he said.

421,MCD,"Winter storms hit FedEx's quarterly results, outlook","(Reuters) - FedEx Corp (FDX.N) on Wednesday said severe winter conditions had hurt quarterly earnings and revenue, prompting the world’s No. 2 package delivery company to cut its fiscal-year profit forecast. The unusual weather disrupted operations, reduced shipping volumes and increased costs, decreasing operating income by about $125 million in the third quarter ended on February 28, FedEx said. But the company also said it was on track with its plan to improve earnings at the FedEx Express air delivery unit by $1.6 billion by the end of 2016. FedEx reported earnings of $378 million, or $1.23 a share, compared with $361 million, or $1.13 a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting $1.45 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 3 percent to $11.3 billion, missing forecasts of $11.43 billion. The company said it expected to earn $6.55 to $6.80 a share for the year, down from its earlier outlook of $6.73 to $7.10. Analysts had forecast $6.89. While analysts expected weather conditions to hurt FedEx, it was difficult to estimate the financial impact without interim data, said Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker. Shares of FedEx were down 0.4 percent at $137.99 in afternoon trading. “While we were disappointed with the third-quarter earnings miss, the shortfall was due to weather-related costs,” Deutsche Bank analyst Justin Yagerman wrote in a note to clients. “FedEx remains one of our favorite ways to benefit from an improving economy.” FedEx’s numbers provide the first real look at the impact the brutal winter had on the shipping industry. Temperatures across a vast area of the United States, from the Great Plains through the Midwest and into the northern Appalachians, ran 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3.3 to 5.5 degrees Celsius) below normal for 2-1/2 months straight. Companies across the board have been talking about how the weather hurt their quarterly results. McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) partly blamed a fall in January sales at its established U.S. restaurants on the frigid cold and snow, while vitamin and nutritional supplements retailer GNC Holdings Inc (GNC.N) warned that its first-quarter results would miss expectations for that reason. Ford Motor Co (F.N), railroad operator CSX Corp CSX.N and air carrier United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) have also said the weather was affecting operations in the first quarter. During the third quarter, FedEx entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to buy back an aggregate of $2.0 billion of common stock. The third-quarter results benefited from Cyber Week, a heavy online shopping period that had fallen in the second quarter last year, as well as from one additional operating day, the company said. However, problems stemming from the harsh winter overshadowed those benefits. Apart from bad weather, FedEx, like bigger rival United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N), was also hit by an unprecedented surge in online holiday shipping volumes. Typically, a rise in online sales is good news for companies like these because it means more demand for their services. But this time, UPS said it had been overwhelmed by the volume of holiday packages. The arrival of Christmas presents around the globe was delayed, and angry customers took to social websites to complain. However, on a conference call with analysts, FedEx Chief Executive Officer Frederick Smith said the company was able to handle a rise in volumes and that social media might have blown the problems out of proportion. “We live in a world where Twitter and social media makes anecdotes,” Smith said. “That was the big difference.” While an increase in e-commerce was helpful to FedEx, he said, many shippers did not have the ability to handle last-minute orders, which added to the holiday delivery congestion. Many industry experts think shoppers are more comfortable with making online purchases at the last minute because large online retailers like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) can deliver the orders in one or two days. Not all retailers have the necessary infrastructure to do that, however, so courier companies saw a huge rise in last-minute shipping volumes. In the third quarter, average daily volume at FedEx’s ground unit rose 8 percent.

426,MCD,UPDATE 5-McDonald's quits Crimea as fears of trade clash grow,"* Says leaving due to reasons beyond its control * Operates over 400 outlets across Russia * Russia’s Zhirinovsky calls for restaurant pickets   (Adds McDonald’s comment) By Natalia Zinets KIEV, April 4 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp said on Friday it had closed its restaurants in Crimea, prompting fears of a backlash as a prominent Moscow politician called for all of the U.S. fast food chain’s outlets in Russia to be shut. Crimea’s annexation by Russia, which Ukraine and the West do not acknowledge, has worried companies with assets in the Black Sea peninsula as it is unclear how the change may affect their business. McDonald’s said the decision was strictly based on business and had “nothing to do with politics.” Nevertheless, its move to temporarily close restaurants in Simferopol, Sevastopol and Yalta is likely to be seen as emblematic of the rift in Western-Russian relations, now at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War. “Like many other multi-national companies, McDonald’s is currently evaluating potential business and regulatory implications which may result from the evolving situation in Crimea,” McDonald’s said in a statement. “Due to the suspension of necessary financial and banking services, we have no option but to close our three restaurants in Crimea.” The Crimean outlets are not franchises, but owned and operated by McDonald’s itself. The closures follow Geneva-based Universal Postal Deutsche Post’s announcement that it was no longer accepting letters bound for Crimea as delivery to the region was no longer guaranteed. Economic relations between Russia and Ukraine have worsened since Russia annexed Crimea last month in response to the ouster of Russian-backed president Viktor Yanukovich after months of street protests in Kiev. Targeted sanctions imposed on a number of prominent Russians by the United States and the European Union have alarmed some foreign investors. Russia raised the price it charges Ukraine for gas on Thursday for the second time this week, almost doubling it in three days by cancelling previous discounts.  While that may hurt Russian sellers, it piles pressure on a Ukraine teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. Moscow has often used energy as a political weapon in dealing with its neighbours, and European customers are now  concerned Russia might again cut off deliveries. The Ukrainian government said it was looking at alternatives including buying gas from western neighbours, an option that would mean reversing flows in transcontinental pipelines. Moscow is applying economic pressure in other areas. Russian riot police last month took control of a factory belonging to a Ukrainian confectionery magnate in the city of Lipetsk as part of an investigation into the company’s affairs, the Ukrainian government has said. Petro Poroshenko, a billionaire oligarch known as the “Chocolate King”, is the front-runner in Ukraine’s presidential election, which has been set for May 25. Ukraine this week temporarily banned seven Russian food companies from selling some of their products on Ukrainian territory. McDonald’s said it would help relocate staff to work in mainland Ukraine, signalling it did not expect its Crimean businesses to reopen in the near future. The deputy speaker of the Russian parliament, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, known for his anti-Western rhetoric, demanded that McDonald’s entirely pull its business out of Russia. “It would be good if they closed here too ... if they disappeared for good. Pepsi-Cola would be next,” Russian media quoted Zhirinovsky as saying. Zhirinovsky, whose nationalist Liberal Democratic party  largely backs President Vladimir Putin in parliament, said the party would organise pickets at McDonald’s restaurants across the country. McDonald’s, which operates more than 400 restaurants in Russia, was the first international fast-food chain to tap the Russian market when it opened in Moscow’s Pushkin Square before the collapse of the Soviet Union. That branch had the highest sales and served the most customers of any McDonald’s outlet in 2012. A Russian backlash against McDonald’s products would have a significant impact on company profits.

427,MCD,McDonald's quits Crimea as fears of trade clash grow,"KIEV (Reuters) - McDonald’s announced on Friday it had closed its restaurants in Crimea, prompting fears of a backlash as a prominent Moscow politician called for all the U.S. fast food chain’s outlets in Russia to be shut. Crimea’s annexation by Russia, which Ukraine and the West do not acknowledge, has worried companies with assets in the Black Sea peninsula as it is unclear how the change may impact their business. While McDonald’s did not mention the political situation in its statement, its decision to leave the region is likely to be seen as emblematic of the rift in Western-Russian relations, now at their lowest ebb since the end of the Cold War. “Due to operational reasons beyond our control, McDonald’s has taken the decision to temporarily close our three restaurants in Simferopol, Sevastopol and Yalta,” a spokeswoman said. The Crimean outlets are not franchises, but owned and operated by McDonald’s itself. The closures follow Geneva-based Universal Postal Deutsche Post’s (DPWGn.DE) announcement that it was no longer accepting letters bound for Crimea as delivery to the region was no longer guaranteed. Economic relations between Russia and Ukraine have worsened since Russia annexed Crimea last month in response to the ousting of Russian-backed president Viktor Yanukovich after months of street protests in Kiev. Targeted sanctions imposed on a number of prominent Russians by the United States and the European Union have alarmed some foreign investors. Russia raised the price it charges Ukraine for gas on Thursday for the second time this week, almost doubling it in three days and piling pressure on its neighbor as it teeters on the brink of bankruptcy. Moscow has frequently used energy as a political weapon in dealing with its neighbors, and European customers are now concerned Russia might again cut off deliveries. Moscow is applying economic pressure in other areas, while Ukraine has responded. Russian riot police last month took control of a factory belonging to a Ukrainian confectionery magnate in the city of Lipetsk as part of an investigation into the company’s affairs, the Ukrainian government has said. Petro Poroshenko, a billionaire oligarch known as the “Chocolate King”, is the front-runner in Ukraine’s presidential election, which is set for May 25. Ukraine this week temporarily banned seven Russian food companies from selling some of their products on Ukrainian territory. McDonald’s (MCD.N) said it hoped to resume work as soon as possible but said it would help relocate staff to work in mainland Ukraine, signaling it did not expect its Crimean businesses to reopen in the near future. The company’s decision was welcomed by the deputy speaker of the Russian parliament, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, known for his anti-Western rhetoric, who demanded that McDonald’s pull its business out of Russia entirely. “It would be good if they closed here too ... if they disappeared for good. Pepsi-Cola would be next,” Russian media quoted Zhirinovsky as saying. PEP.N Zhirinovsky, whose nationalist Liberal Democratic party largely backs President Vladimir Putin in parliament, said the party would organize pickets at McDonald’s restaurants across the country. McDonald’s, which currently operates more than 400 restaurants in Russia, was the first international fast-food chain to tap the Russian market when it opened in Moscow’s Pushkin Square before the collapse of the Soviet Union. That branch had the highest sales and served the most customers of any McDonald’s outlet in 2012. A Russian backlash again McDonald’s products would have a significant impact on company profits. McDonald’s sees Russia as one of its top seven major markets outside the United States and Canada, according to its 2013 annual report. However Russian moves to shun McDonald’s burgers could easily backfire, according to Russian newswire RBK, which detailed Russian food suppliers to McDonald’s that would suffer as a result.

431,MCD,"McDonald's profit falls, U.S. diners not 'lovin' it'","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) is getting back to basics after a string of disappointing quarterly results in its home market of the United States, which accounts for 30 percent of overall revenue. The fast-food giant has reported roughly two years of turbulent sales at established U.S. restaurants due to sluggish economic growth, stiffer competition and internal missteps that have complicated menus and slowed service. Adding to the pressure, higher costs for beef, chicken and labor are squeezing profits because customers are cutting back on visits as McDonald’s raises prices to offset the additional expenses. Chief Executive Don Thompson said on Tuesday that McDonald’s is launching a “reset initiative” in the United States that would include tweaking staffing to improve speed during peak hours and putting more focus on affordability and core menu items, such as the Big Mac, Egg McMuffin and french fries. These core items account for 40 percent of sales. The CEO, who took the helm at the Golden Arches in July 2012, urged investors to be patient. “This is not about a silver bullet. It is important to underscore that it will take time for consumers to notice the changes and reward us with increased visits,” Thompson said on a conference call with analysts. Sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months fell a steeper than expected 1.7 percent in the first quarter. McDonald’s prices were up 3 percent during the quarter and traffic fell, suggesting push-back from diners. The lackluster results from McDonald’s landed a few days after Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), the popular burrito chain it spun off in 2006, said its first-quarter same-restaurant sales jumped 13.4 percent. Chipotle caters to a wealthier consumer than McDonald’s and it serves on-trend food, including dishes made with organic produce and antibiotic-free meats. It is planning to begin raising prices at the end of this quarter to offset higher costs. This year promises to remain challenging for McDonald’s as it grapples with record-high beef prices, labor cost increases, image-denting protests from its minimum-wage workers and aggressive competition from rivals that include Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N, Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and Yum Brands’ (YUM.N) Taco Bell as well as privately held chains such as In-N-Out Burger and Five Guys Burgers and Fries. McDonald’s said first-quarter net income fell 5 percent to $1.2 billion, or $1.21 per share, missing Wall Street’s estimate by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. First-quarter commodity costs in the United States were up roughly 3 percent, primarily due to higher protein costs. “We expect similar pressure in second quarter then easing throughout the second half of the year,” Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen said. Wall Street analysts agreed that a U.S. turnaround will be slow in coming. “We continue to view McDonald’s domestic business as hampered by a menu with far too many items on it, which is slowing average service times,” Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a research note. Elsewhere, McDonald’s fared better. Same-restaurant sales in Europe, its top market, which contributes around 40 percent of overall sales, were up 1.4 percent, slightly better than analysts’ forecast for a 1.2 percent gain.

435,MCD,UPDATE 1-McDonald's Canada freezes use of foreign worker plan,"(Adds background on foreign worker issues, government actions, quote from employment minister spokeswoman; paragraphs 3-7, 8-12) By Julie Gordon VANCOUVER, April 23 (Reuters) - The Canadian unit of McDonald’s Corp has suspended all of its applications under the country’s temporary foreign worker program as its undergoes a third-party audit on its use, the restaurant chain said on Wednesday. The move comes after the fast-food giant was criticized in media reports in recent weeks about its use of the Canadian government plan, which allows companies to bring in foreign workers when there are no local residents available. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported this month that a franchise owner in Victoria, British Columbia, was bringing in foreign workers for three locations while at the same time turning away seemingly qualified Canadians seeking jobs and cutting local staffers’ hours. That was followed by similar media reports involving other McDonald’s restaurants in Western Canada, prompting the federal government to launch a probe of the fast-food chain’s use of the program. The company has cut ties with the Victoria franchise-owner, but has defended its broader use of the program, noting that it uses the temporary foreign worker program only as a “last resort” in markets where there are severe labor shortages. “Of our more than 85,000 employees nationwide, temporary foreign workers account for approximately 4 percent of our workforce,” the company said in a statement. While McDonald’s has frozen all applications during its review, the company said, it continues to support the program and expects to continue participating in it. The company said the freeze will not affect the temporary foreign workers it employs who already have work permits. McDonald’s is not the only company to face a backlash over its use of the controversial program. The Royal Bank of Canada was heavily criticized last year following a CBC report that U.S. outsourcing firm iGate  used temporary foreign worker visas as it worked to replace a few dozen staff at the bank’s Toronto investor services division. The bank’s chief executive later apologized to employees said it would offer them jobs elsewhere in the bank. “Our government will not tolerate any abuse of the temporary foreign worker program. Our message to employers is clear and unequivocal - Canadians must always be first in line for available jobs,” said Alexandra Fortier, spokeswoman for Canada’s employment minister, Jason Kenney. Canada blacklisted three Victoria McDonald’s locations in early April after investigations related to the CBC report, suspending their ability to employ temporary foreign workers. Four non-related restaurants in eastern Canada were also blacklisted.

In 2013, 454,962 million tonnes (1 billion lbs) of the world’s coffee was grown on Rainforest Alliance certified farms, with increased demand from companies such as McDonald’s USA, McDonald’s Canada, Second Cup and Green Mountain Coffee  driving the growth. New York-based Rainforest Alliance and Fair Trade USA are two of several international commodity auditors such as Fair Trade International and Utz. Each has its own regulations to ensure that agricultural products are grown in a way that will not harm the environment while promoting socio-economic growth with premium payments that are typically passed along to consumers.

438,MCD,RPT-Canada stops restaurants from hiring temporary foreign workers,"April 25 (Reuters) - Canada will not allow restaurants to hire any more temporary foreign workers until the federal government completes a review of a program set up as a last resort for employers to fill jobs when no qualified Canadians are available. The moratorium, which only affects food-service businesses, follows a decision by the Canadian unit of McDonald’s Corp  earlier this week to suspend all of its applications under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program. The federal government took the action, announced in a statement late Thursday, after starting an investigation into alleged abuses of the program within the food-service industry. Jason Kenney, the minister for employment and social development, said officials had placed a moratorium on processing new applications from food-service businesses, and it would stop restaurants from hiring workers for unfilled jobs when applications were already approved. Kenny said the government was considering unspecified reforms of the program to make sure employers recruit and train Canadians for jobs. “Our government has been clear,” he said in the statement. “Canadians must have the first chance at available jobs.” The moratorium has no effect on a temporary foreign worker program for the agricultural industry. The government said there were “proven acute labor shortages” in that industry, and unfilled farm jobs were short-term “by definition.” The Canadian Broadcasting Corp reported this month that a McDonald’s franchise owner in Victoria, British Columbia, was bringing in foreign workers for three locations while turning away seemingly qualified Canadian job-seekers and cutting the local staff’s working hours. That was followed by similar media reports involving other McDonald’s restaurants in Western Canada. The company has cut ties with the Victoria franchise-owner but has defended its broader use of the Temporary Foreign Worker Program, which it said it used only as a last resort in markets where there are severe labor shortages.

444,MCD,Frugal U.S. consumers make it tough for food companies to raise prices,"NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Rebecca Sumrow is one of the customers food and restaurant company executives have in mind when they consider raising prices to offset higher costs as meat and milk soar to record highs. The 30-year-old from San Clemente, California, was out of work for a short time last year and saved money by moving in with her boyfriend and cutting back on clothes shopping and dining out. Though she now has a good job working for an investment firm, she’s maintaining her frugal ways. Consumers “have gotten really good over these last four years at stretching a penny,” said Pat Conroy, leader of the U.S. consumer products practice at Deloitte LLP. Referring to the recession, he said, “Our hypothesis was that this thing was going to leave a scar, not a bruise. So far, we’ve been right.” According to Deloitte’s annual survey of food shoppers released last week, 94 percent agreed they would remain cautious and keep spending at the same level even if the economy improves. That’s about the same percentage as it was in 2010 in the aftermath of the credit crisis. So Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), Hillshire Brands Co HSN.N and Kraft Foods Group Inc KRFT.O, all of which are raising prices, will be trying to retain consumers stuck with stagnant incomes and unhappy memories of the recession. Faced with little choice but to boost prices to cover the spike in costs for products like milk and meat, companies often are taking extra care to justify or soften the increases. Kraft has raised, or will soon increase, prices on about 45 percent of the products in its portfolio, including cheese, cold cuts and bacon. Hillshire raised the prices on Jimmy Dean sausage and Ball Park hot dogs as retail pork prices hit a record high of $1.99 a pound in March, from $1.40 a pound a year ago, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. McDonald’s eliminated its “dollar menu” last year to give it flexibility to raise prices to offset high costs for meat and other ingredients. Chipotle is one of the few companies expected to have the power to raise prices due to its popularity with higher income diners. The burrito chain is increasing menu prices this quarter, but only after giving customers a benefit by removing almost all food ingredients made with genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. “You’re hearing that they want to, but the question always becomes: Can it stick?” said Prudential Financial market strategist Quincy Krosby, referring to raising prices. “What the consumer has been very good about is going on strike.” That’s happening now in the dairy aisle. As U.S. milk prices go up, shoppers buy less, according to Dean Foods Co (DF.N), the largest U.S. milk processor. Fluid milk industry volumes fell 2.1 percent in the first quarter, according to Dean. “There are certain price thresholds that we can’t cross, or it starts to impact the demand,” Dean Chief Executive Gregg Tanner said on a conference call with analysts last week. “We experienced additional softness in our volumes during March and April.” The wholesale price for beverage milk was about $2.10 per gallon in May, a record, and up 38 percent from a year ago, according to dairy analyst Jerry Dryer. In March, retail milk prices were up only 6.5 percent, suggesting that retailers are eating much of the cost increase, he said. U.S. consumer prices rose 1.5 percent in March from the year earlier, led by food and housing rental costs. An index of inflation tracked by the Federal Reserve is running even lower at 1.2 percent, against the central bank’s target of a 2 percent inflation rate. Many consumers are still struggling in a tough labor market. Labor force participation remains depressed. Private-sector wages were unchanged in April and over the past 12 months have averaged monthly increases of just 0.16 percent. “There’s still a large swath of the population that just doesn’t have the spending power,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. Pricing issues already have changed the fortunes of Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O and McDonald’s, which are battling rivals that emerged from the recession willing to start price wars. McDonald’s raised prices late last year in a bid to protect profits from higher meat costs. Its customers, who tend to earn less than those who frequent Chipotle, voted with their feet and U.S. sales at established restaurants have not posted a monthly gain since October. Whole Foods, the leading natural and organic grocer nicknamed “Whole Paycheck” because of a perception among some consumers of high prices, has seen same-store sales growth cool as mainstream food sellers add more organics and undercut it on price. Its most aggressive rival could be Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), which in the United States will introduce 100 Wild Oats-branded organic packaged food products ranging from olive oil to black beans in about 2,000 stores in coming months. Walmart, which tends to cater to lower-income shoppers and sells more groceries than any other domestic retailer, said those products would be priced on par with conventional rivals and at least 25 percent below branded organic foods. “It’s really hard for Whole Foods to start a price war. It’s really easy for Walmart,” said Wolfe Research retail analyst Scott Mushkin. For her part, Sumrow says she’s spending more time in the dollar store produce aisles and less time in upscale places like Whole Foods, though she still splurges on things like unpasteurized milk for about $6 a gallon and fresh spinach, kale and chard for her daily juicing ritual. She’s not inclined to loosen up her spending anytime soon, even though she’s making more money. “We have to be very careful with our finances to be able to get anywhere,” she said, adding that neither she nor her sister plan to have children because it doesn’t make financial sense. “We have to tighten our belts and invest wisely and try to get established when everything is working against us.” ",5142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-prices-food-analysis/frugal-u-s-consumers-make-it-tough-for-food-companies-to-raise-prices-idUSBREA4D03X20140514
445,MCD,U.S. fast-food workers go on strike to protest low pay,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. fast-food workers went on strike on Thursday, aiming to convince thousands of restaurants they make huge profits from paying them a pittance and that they deserve a raise. The one-day strike is the latest in a series of U.S. protests over the past 18 months that have targeted fast-food restaurant operators, including McDonald’s Corp and Burger King Worldwide Inc. They come at a time when U.S. Democrats have been pushing to raise the federal minimum wage ahead of this year’s mid-term congressional elections, seeing income inequality as a powerful campaign issue. Fast-food workers are seeking wages of $15 an hour and the right to unionize without retaliation, union leaders said. Tammy Castellanos, 35, was among about 200 people who demonstrated Thursday in a cold rain at the Rock & Roll McDonald’s near downtown Chicago, which is known for its pop memorabilia. “I have done so much for Burger King and I don’t make enough to pay the rent,” said Castellanos, a single mother with five children ranging in age from 21 months to 18 years old. She said she makes $10 an hour after a decade working at Burger King. Wendy Gonzales, 25, said she makes $8.60 an hour after four years at a McDonald’s and lives with her parents in Chicago. “I am trying to get a raise so I can get my own apartment and be independent,” Gonzales said. “I want to go back to school.” Marco Mejia, 66, a Chicago retiree who was eating breakfast at McDonald’s, said he supported the workers. “It’s a shame,” Mejia said. “The CEOs of these companies are making millions of dollars and do absolutely nothing, and these people are working so hard and make the minimum (wage).” McDonald’s, the world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue, and Burger King have defended their treatment of employees, saying they pay fair wages. Strikes were expected to be held in 150 cities, including Boston, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia and Miami, where about 50 people gathered in the rain outside of a McDonald’s near a downtown hospital. Among the Miami demonstrators was Selmira Wilson, who said through a translator that it was nearly impossible to care for her three children with the low wages she earned from McDonald’s. “I have to work two jobs,” Wilson said. “I clean offices at night just to get by.” U.S. President Barack Obama has pushed Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour from the current $7.25, a move fought by Republicans in Congress. Twenty-one states and Washington, D.C. have minimum wages higher than the federal minimum wage, and 38 states have considered minimum wage bills during the 2014 session, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The state of Washington has the highest minimum wage at $9.32 an hour.

447,MCD,McDonald's new 'Happy' mascot dubbed McScary in social media,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - McDonald’s restaurant chain says its new “Happy” mascot will bring “fun and excitement” to its children’s meals, but social media contend the toothy, red box-shaped character will have the opposite effect. Twitter responses to McDonald’s mascot announcement on Monday complain that the animated red Happy Meal box, with its cavernous dark mouth and rows of large white teeth, is scary and will bring children nightmares instead of joy. “It’s the meal that eats you,” said one comment. Another said, “I didn’t want to sleep tonight anyways, it’s cool.” The character will be introduced nationwide on Friday. Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s said in a statement that it will encourage kids to enjoy healthy food choices, like fruit, vegetables and low-fat dairy. In response to the criticism on social media, McDonald’s spokeswoman Lisa McComb noted that since 2009, the character has been “loved and well-received by children and families in Latin America and Europe.” “Social media is a great place to have a conversation and express an opinion, but not all comments reflect the broader view,” McComb said in an email on Tuesday. The restaurant chain, which has its annual shareholders’ meeting on Thursday, has often been the focus of criticism over the fast-food industry’s penchant for offering indulgent, high-calorie food. In recent years, the U.S. food industry in general has faced government and consumer pressure to address the global obesity epidemic. In March 2012, McDonald’s started automatically including apple slices and a kid-size fry in every Happy Meal and Mighty Kids Meal.

450,MCD,McDonald's workers protest low wages as shareholders weigh executive pay,"(Reuters) - Hundreds of low-wage McDonald’s workers protested near the fast-food chain’s headquarters on Wednesday calling for a significant pay hike as shareholders prepare to weigh in on the company’s executive compensation. The McDonald’s workers are calling for roughly a doubling of pay to $15 per hour and the right to unionize. Their frequent rallies have helped fuel a national debate on pay inequality at a time when many middle- to low-income Americans have curtailed spending to help make ends meet. The latest, and possibly largest, protest against the world’s biggest fast-food company comes a day ahead of an investor vote on executive pay at McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), where Chief Executive Don Thompson took home total compensation of $9.5 million in 2013. Jessica Davis, a 25-year-old McDonald’s crew trainer with two children, said CEO Thompson is earning his millions on the backs of working mothers and fathers. Davis, who works at a Chicago McDonald’s, says she earns $8.98 per hour and works part-time despite requests for more hours. “We need to show McDonald’s that we’re serious and that we’re not backing down,” said Davis, who joined Wednesday’s protest, which was moved to an area near the planned shareholder meeting location after the company closed the headquarters building near Chicago targeted by protesters following a police consultation. McDonald’s, which is grappling with sagging U.S. sales and profit-crimping beef price spikes, does not disclose average pay for restaurant workers, most of whom work for franchisees. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the 3.5 million fast-food and counter workers in the United States earn a median hourly wage of $8.83, or almost $18,400 per year based on a 40-hour work week without vacation. A recent report from New York think tank Demos found that the CEO-to-worker compensation ratio for the fast food industry was more than 1,000-to-1 in 2013. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) shareholders, in a non-binding vote, on May 15 voted more than 3-to-1 against the advisory pay proposal from the popular burrito seller, which gave co-CEOs Steve Ells and Monty Moran total 2013 compensation of $25.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively. Thus far, public pension fund managers from New York City, Connecticut and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) have said they plan to vote against the McDonald’s advisory measure on executive pay. The measure asks shareholders to vote on the way the company formulates compensation for its executives. Officials of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and the Florida State Board of Administration said they would vote in support of the measure. U.S. President Barack Obama has pushed Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour from $7.25 currently. Washington, D.C. and 21 states have minimum wages higher than the federal level, and 38 states have considered minimum wage bills during the 2014 session, the National Conference of State Legislatures said.

455,MCD,RPT-Critics of supersized CEO pay face uphill fight at McDonald's,"(Repeats with no change to text) By Lisa Baertlein and Ross Kerber LOS ANGELES/BOSTON, May 20 (Reuters) - The next big showdown in the running battle over U.S. executive pay is shaping up to be the annual meeting of McDonald’s Corp on Thursday, but critics may have a tough time replicating their victory last week at Chipotle Mexican Grill. McDonald’s is a main target of protesters and labor groups, who criticize the world’s biggest fast-food chain for paying millions of dollars to its chief executive while many front-line restaurant workers are scraping by at or near minimum wage. “For too many CEOs, it’s heads I win, tails I win,” said New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer in an interview on Tuesday. CEOs often get well paid no matter how a company performs, Stringer said. Stringer said his office would vote the 2.6 million shares of McDonald’s held in the city’s pension funds against an advisory measure on executive pay, and that some investors worry income inequalities could threaten profit. “You can’t grow the economy the way we need to if low-wage workers don’t have the money to spend on goods and services,” he said. Stringer’s funds also voted against the pay at Chipotle, whose co-CEOs Steve Ells and Monty Moran received total 2013 compensation of $25.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively. McDonald’s Chief Executive Don Thompson made $9.5 million in 2013, down from $13.8 million in 2012. Chipotle shareholders offered a scant 23 percent support for a similar advisory pay proposal at the popular burrito seller on May 15, which has earned praise for eye-popping stock gains and scorn for supersizing compensation for its co-CEOs. But at least two big public pension fund managers that opposed Chipotle’s pay proposal said they would support pay for McDonald’s executives, including Thompson. The managers were the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and the Florida State Board of Administration. Aeisha Mastagni, a CalSTRS Investment Officer, said the pay contests are quite different and noted how McDonald’s market capitalization of $100 billion is more than six times that of Chipotle’s. “The compensation at McDonald’s, in the grand scheme of things, it’s quite reasonable,” she said. She also noted how Thompson must cope with different challenges including a turn to healthier diets and having many more stores. McDonald’s, she said, “is a very different company than the growth story that’s going on at Chipotle.” In addition, the influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services has recommended investors approve the pay at McDonald’s, in contrast to its recommendation to vote against the Chipotle pay. Pay consultants view results below 70 percent support for executive pay as a sign that boards should revamp compensation, so even a close vote could pressure on McDonald’s to make changes. McDonald’s, in a proxy filing, asked shareholders to vote in favor of the pay proposal at its annual meeting, which will be closed to the media for the first time because of poor attendance. The vote comes as the chain battles market share losses to U.S. rivals and profit-squeezing spikes in beef costs. Shares in Chipotle have vastly outperformed McDonald’s since 2010, rising 469 percent versus a 64 percent gain for the Golden Arches.

Stringer’s funds also voted against the pay at Chipotle, whose co-CEOs Steve Ells and Monty Moran received total 2013 compensation of $25.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively. McDonald’s Chief Executive Don Thompson made $9.5 million in 2013, down from $13.8 million in 2012. Chipotle shareholders offered a scant 23 percent support for a similar advisory pay proposal at the popular burrito seller on May 15, which has earned praise for eye-popping stock gains and scorn for supersizing compensation for its co-CEOs. But at least two big public pension fund managers that opposed Chipotle’s pay proposal said they would support pay for McDonald’s executives, including Thompson. The managers were the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and the Florida State Board of Administration. Aeisha Mastagni, a CalSTRS Investment Officer, said the pay contests are quite different and noted how McDonald’s market capitalization of $100 billion is more than six times that of Chipotle’s. “The compensation at McDonald’s, in the grand scheme of things, it’s quite reasonable,” she said. She also noted how Thompson must cope with different challenges including a turn to healthier diets and having many more stores. McDonald’s, she said, “is a very different company than the growth story that’s going on at Chipotle.” In addition, the influential proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services has recommended investors approve the pay at McDonald’s, in contrast to its recommendation to vote against the Chipotle pay. Pay consultants view results below 70 percent support for executive pay as a sign that boards should revamp compensation, so even a close vote could pressure on McDonald’s to make changes. McDonald’s, in a proxy filing, asked shareholders to vote in favor of the pay proposal at its annual meeting, which will be closed to the media for the first time because of poor attendance. The vote comes as the chain battles market share losses to U.S. rivals and profit-squeezing spikes in beef costs.

457,MCD,Critics of supersized CEO pay face uphill fight at McDonald's,"LOS ANGELES/BOSTON, May 20 (Reuters) - The next big showdown in the running battle over U.S. executive pay is shaping up to be the annual meeting of McDonald’s Corp on Thursday, but critics may have a tough time replicating their victory last week at Chipotle Mexican Grill. McDonald’s is a main target of protesters and labor groups, who criticize the world’s biggest fast-food chain for paying millions of dollars to its chief executive while many front-line restaurant workers are scraping by at or near minimum wage. “For too many CEOs, it’s heads I win, tails I win,” said New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer in an interview on Tuesday. CEOs often get well paid no matter how a company performs, Stringer said. Stringer said his office would vote the 2.6 million shares of McDonald’s held in the city’s pension funds against an advisory measure on executive pay, and that some investors worry income inequalities could threaten profit. “You can’t grow the economy the way we need to if low-wage workers don’t have the money to spend on goods and services,” he said.

461,MCD,Fitch Affirms McDonald's IDRs at 'A/F1' on Shareholder Return Plan; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of McDonald's  Corporation (NYSE: MCD) after the firm's three-year total cash return  announcement. Fitch has affirmed the ratings as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'; --Bank credit facilities at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. At March 31, 2014, McDonald's had $13.9 billion of  total debt.  Key Rating Drivers:  Three-Year Total Cash Shareholder Return Target  The affirmation of McDonald's ratings follows the company's announcement that it  intends to return $18 billion - $20 billion of cash to shareholders between 2014  and 2016 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. The  commitment represents a 10% - 20% increase over the $16.4 billion returned over  the 2011 - 2013 year period. The firm also expects to refranchise at least 1,500  restaurants and reallocate resources related to general and administrative  expenses toward higher return initiatives, including its digital capabilities.  McDonald's financial strategy has consistently been to reinvest in its business,  return cash to shareholders, and maintain credit statistics appropriate for an  'A' credit rating.  The firm has not articulated how much incremental debt it will incur to fund its  three-year return commitment. However, Fitch believes the vast majority will be  funded with internally generated cash flow, proceeds from refranchising, and  other sources of liquidity in order to maintain current ratings.    Fitch projects that McDonald's can generate over $21 billion of cumulative CFO  during the three-year period ended 2016. Management expects capital expenditures  to be between $2.9 billion and $3 billion in 2014 but has not provided guidance  for subsequent years. Potential proceeds from refranchising have not been  disclosed. McDonald's last major refranchising transaction was the sale of 1,571  units in Latin America during 2007, which resulted in $648 million of net  proceeds. Credit metrics are expected to remain acceptable for current ratings but a  slight increase in leverage would eliminate room to accommodate additional  weakening of same-store sales (SSS), operating income, and margins. Two years of  flat to negative global SSS and continued margin contraction concurrent with a  material increase in debt could lead to a negative rating action.  Substantial Cash Flow Generation McDonald's cash flow from operations (CFO) has grown at an 8% compound annual  growth rate since 2003 to $7.1 billion in 2013. CFO growth slowed recently due  to more modest sales and operating income growth but remains substantial. Free  cash flow (FCF - defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures  and dividends) has averaged $1.5 billion since 2003. A re-acceleration of  operating earnings and cash flow growth, driven by McDonald's efforts to  reignite SSS, would minimize any incremental debt required to meet its  three-year return target.  Strong Global Market Position McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant company based on nearly $90 billion  of system-wide sales and a widely respected brand. At Dec. 31, 2013, the system  had 35,429 worldwide units and during the year McDonald's generated $28.2  billion of total revenue and $8.8 billion of operating income. The firm's  geographic segments and their percentage of 2013 revenue and operating income  were: the U.S. (32% and 43%), Europe (40% and 38%), APMEA (Asia/Pacific, Middle  East, and Africa) (23% and 17%), and Other Countries and Corporate (5% and 2%). Significant Franchise Revenue At Dec. 31, 2013, franchisees and affiliates operated 81% of McDonald's units  while the remaining 19% were company-operated. Revenue from franchising totaled  $9.2 billion or 33% of McDonald's total revenue in 2013. Revenue from  franchising includes sales-based royalties and contractual rent payments.  McDonald's owns about 45% of the land and 70% of the buildings for its system of  restaurants. Net property and equipment had a book value of $25.7 billion at  Dec. 31, 2013. Fitch views McDonald's plan to refranchise at least 1,500 units  with an emphasis on APMEA and Europe favorably but expects the firm to continue  to operate a material percentage of its units. Proven Operating Strategy McDonald's three global priorities include optimizing its menu, modernizing the  customer experience, and broadening accessibility to its brand. Annual global  SSS have only declined twice since 1997, despite multiple economic recessions.  McDonald's long-term, average annual constant currency financial targets include  3% - 5% system sales and 6% - 7% operating income growth.  Fitch views McDonald's system sales goals as achievable given the firm's net  restaurant expansion. Management expects net restaurant additions of 949 units,  in line with the increase in 2013, to add about 2.5% to system-wide sales in  2014. Operating income growth, however, could continue to be below target levels  over the near term as costs continue to rise and efforts to regain SSS momentum  take time to resonate with consumers. For 2014, McDonald's expects commodity  costs to increase 1% - 2% in the U.S. and Europe.  First Quarter 2014 Operating Performance: McDonald's revenue increased 3% to $6.7 billion and operating income rose 1% to  $1.9 billion on a constant currency basis during the first quarter ended March  31, 2014. Global SSS grew 0.5% reflecting higher average check and a 3.1%  decline in guest counts. SSS in the U.S. were negative 1.7% while comparable  sales growth was positive 1.4%, 0.8%, and 6.1% in Europe, APMEA, and the Other  Countries and Corporate segment, respectively.  McDonald's combined operating margin declined 60 basis points (bps) versus the  2013 comparable quarter to 28.9%. The decline was due mainly to lower margins in  franchise operations. Franchise margin fell 60 bps to 81.1% due mainly to  negative SSS in the U.S. and higher rent expense in Europe, and APMEA. Global  company-operated restaurant margin declined 10 bps to 16.1%. Fitch believes an intensified focus around customer service along with continued  emphasis on value and menu variety will help McDonald's regain SSS momentum by  late 2014. The firm is focused on improving traffic trends across the U.S.,  Germany, Australia, and Japan and is investing in reimaging and other efforts to  reconnect with and remain relevant to consumers. Credit Statistics:  For the latest 12 month period ended March 31, 2014, total debt-to-operating  EBITDA and rent-adjusted leverage (total debt plus eight times gross rent  expense divided by EBITDA plus gross rents) were 1.4x and 2.4x, respectively.  Rent-adjusted interest coverage (EBITDAR divided by gross interest expense plus  gross rent) was 4.6x and funds from operations (FFO) fixed charge coverage was  3.9x. McDonald's FCF margin to sales was 5.1%. Significant Liquidity, Manageable Maturities:  McDonald's liquidity at March 31, 2014, totaled $4.2 billion and consisted of  $2.7 billion of cash and full availability under the firm's undrawn $1.5 billion  committed revolver, which expires Nov. 1, 2016. Aggregate maturities of  long-term debt as of March 31, 2014 were zero in 2014, approximately $1.2  billion in 2015 and roughly $900 million in 2016. About 60% of the firm's $13.9  billion of debt at March 31, 2014 was U.S. denominated and roughly 40% was  foreign denominated. Rating Sensitivities: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --An upgrade is not anticipated in the intermediate term given McDonald's recent  SSS trends, margin contraction, and plan to partially finance share buybacks  with incremental debt.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA and rent-adjusted leverage sustained over  approximately 1.5x and 2.5x, respectively, and materially lower FCF;  --Two years of flat to negative global SSS and continued margin contraction; --Weak or declining operating cash flow concurrent with meaningful incremental  debt.

462,MCD,McDonald's murder in China sparks outrage,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The murder of a woman at a fastfood restaurant in China has sparked a national outcry after it was revealed she was beaten to death for allegedly refusing to give her telephone number to members of a banned religious group. The 37-year-old woman was attacked by a group of people who were described as being members of the Church of Almighty God religious movement, state media reported. The group preached a global apocalypse would take place in 2012 and has been banned by Chinese authorities. The attack occurred last Wednesday at a McDonald’s restaurant in northeastern Shandong province and was captured on surveillance video, the official Xinhua News Agency said in a commentary. Video footage of the attack was shown on China Central Television on Saturday. Six alleged group members, including four from one family, have been arrested over the attack, state media reported.        “The audacity of the cult members to terrorize their victim at a McDonald’s, a chain frequented by average Chinese, further racked people’s nerves,” Xinhua said. Apart from shock and anger, many social media users condemned onlookers, who failed to stop the assault in coastal Zhaoyuan city, about 160 km north of Qingdao. “If I stay quiet today, who will help me cry for help when I suffer from misfortunes in the future?,” asked one Weibo user. “If I don’t speak up as a passerby, then one day, if injustice should come upon me, no one would speak up for me as well.” ",6012014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-murder/mcdonalds-murder-in-china-sparks-outrage-idUSKBN0EC15B20140601
463,MCD,Small plane crashes near McDonald's drive-thru in Louisiana,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - A small plane crashed into a northern Louisiana McDonald’s parking lot near the drive-thru on Tuesday, injuring the pilot and wrecking a car, an airport official said.  The Beechcraft Bonanza plane was preparing to land at the nearby Monroe Regional Airport when it clipped a tree, began to spin and then crashed into the parking lot at the fast food restaurant, said Ron Phillips, the airport’s director.  The McDonald’s is heavily trafficked, and an office building across the street houses state Department of Transportation officials, but no one else was injured in the crash, Phillips said.      “It could have been a lot worse,” he said.      The pilot was identified by authorities as Michael Ray Martin, 41, of Calhoun, Louisiana.      He was airlifted to a hospital in Shreveport, about 100 miles (160 km) to the west, the Ouachita Parish Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. No information was available on his condition.

465,MCD,"McDonald's May global comparable sales rise, but U.S. falls again","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp MCD.N on Monday reported a small rise in global sales at established restaurants for May, after a rebound in China helped offset another month of disappointing results from the fast-food chain’s home market of the United States. McDonald’s U.S. sales at restaurants open at least 13 months were down 1 percent in May, marking the seventh straight month of declines as it struggles with stiff competition from resurgent rivals such as Wendy’s Co WEN.O and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N, internal missteps that have slowed service and image-denting protests from its minimum-wage workers.

471,MCD,Obama to nominate former P&G; CEO Bob McDonald as veterans secretary,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama has chosen former Procter & Gamble Chief Executive Bob McDonald, an Army veteran, as his nominee to be the next secretary of veterans affairs, a senior Obama administration official said on Sunday. Obama’s announcement of McDonald, 61, will be made this week, possibly on Monday. If confirmed by the Senate, McDonald would be tasked with repairing the Veterans Administration after widespread evidence of delays in military veterans getting healthcare at VA facilities. The announcement is to come days after a White House review found significant and chronic failures across the board at the Veterans Administration and evidence that a “corrosive culture” prevails. A senior administration official said Obama was attracted to McDonald by his corporate background and military service. He would succeed Eric Shinseki, who resigned late in May after the depth of the VA’s problems became clear. McDonald is the former chairman, president and CEO of Procter & Gamble, having retired a year ago after 33 years with the Fortune 500 company, where he started as a brand assistant in 1980 and rose through the ranks. He served on the McKinsey Advisory Council, the Singapore International Advisory Council of the Economic Development Board, and on the boards of U.S. Steel and Xerox Corp. Officials believe his lengthy tenure at P&G; prepares him well for a huge agency with management challenges in providing services to more 8 million veterans a year. At P&G;, he oversaw more than 120,000 employees, with operations around the world, selling products in more than 180 countries. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner called McDonald “a good man, a veteran, and a strong leader with decades of experience in the private sector. With those traits, he’s the kind of person who is capable of implementing the kind of dramatic systemic change that is badly needed and long overdue at the VA.” But Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, added: “The next VA secretary can only succeed in implementing that type of change if his boss, the president, first commits to doing whatever it takes to give our veterans the world class health care system they deserve by articulating a vision for sweeping reform. Our nation’s veterans deserve nothing less.” After graduating in the top 2 percent of his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, McDonald served in the U.S. Army as a captain, primarily in the 82nd Airborne Division, and received the Meritorious Service Medal.    “Bob is an immensely gifted and caring individual.  That was evident to me when we first met as cadets at West Point, over 40 years ago,” retired Major General James “Spider” Marks said in a statement. “He came from a military family, and knows the challenges from living them.” Corporate colleagues of McDonald repeatedly cited his management abilities in grappling with large and complex organizations.     American Express Chief Executive Ken Chenault, who served on the P&G; board during McDonald’s time there, called McDonald a strong manager who knows how to make large organizations work effectively. “He’s an excellent choice to set the right course for the Veterans Administration at a difficult time,” Chenault said in a statement. The White House review, which was conducted by senior Obama aide Rob Nabors, said the agency’s 14-day scheduling standard for new patients to receive care was arbitrary, ill-defined and misunderstood. Obama accepted the findings on Friday by Nabors and acting Veterans Secretary Sloan Gibson, who said: “We can and must solve these problems as we work to earn back the trust of veterans.” ",6292014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-veterans/obama-to-nominate-former-pg-ceo-bob-mcdonald-as-veterans-secretary-idUSKBN0F40W820140629

473,MCD,"McDonald's, Taco Bell, KFC laggards in U.S. fast-food survey","(Reuters) - Fast-food titans McDonald’s, Taco Bell and KFC are conquering the globe, but they are losing to the likes of In-N-Out Burger, Chipotle Mexican Grill and Chick-fil-A in the United States,  according to Consumer Reports’ latest fast-food survey. The survey, released on Wednesday, ranked regional chain In-N-Out-Burger the industry’s best hamburger chain, based on food quality, value and service. Rubio’s Fresh Mexican Grill was the No. 1 Mexican chain, followed by Chipotle, while Chick-fil-A ranked highest among chicken chains. The results track with sales results at many of the major fast-food chains, which are struggling to find the right recipe to woo younger U.S. diners who increasingly are seeking fresher, healthier food. “More and more, food quality - not just low price - is emerging as a deciding-factor for many Americans,” said Tod Marks, senior projects editor for Consumer Reports.  Marks called results Consumer Reports’ poll of 32,405 subscribers, a “wake-up call” for the industry: “Our survey clearly shows the big guys need to respond.” The top-rated hamburger restaurants were  In-N-Out Burger, The Habit Burger Grill and Culver’s. McDonald’s Corp, the world’s largest chain but a laggard when it comes to taste, finished behind 20 others, including Jack in the Box Inc, Wendy’s Co and Burger King Worldwide Inc.  Yum Brands Inc’s Taco Bell, which spiced up U.S. sales with Doritos Locos Tacos and breakfast, finished at No. 8 among Mexican chains behind Rubio’s Fresh Mexican Grill, Chipotle Mexican Grill and Qdoba Mexican Grill.  Yum’s KFC also landed the eighth position in the chicken restaurant category behind Chick-fil-A, Boston Market and El Pollo Loco.  The nation’s top pizza chain was Papa Murphy’s Take ‘N’ Bake Pizza, ahead of bigger rivals Papa John’s International Inc and Domino’s Pizza Inc. Portillo’s Hot Dogs, Jason’s Deli and Firehouse Subs were leaders in the fragmented sandwich category. Pei Wei Asian Diner was No. 1 in the emerging Asian segment. Chick-fil-A, which has stirred fiery debate with its anti-gay marriage stance, also led in service and clean surroundings. Del Taco got first place for “more for your money”. Privately held Subway, whose pitch man Jared Fogle lost more than 200 lbs on a diet of the privately held sandwich seller’s food, was No. 1 for healthful choices, followed by Jason’s Deli and Panera Bread Co. When it comes to unhealthy “foods to fear,” Consumer Reports called out Firehouse Subs’ large Sweet Thai Chili Pork Sub that clocked in at 1,541 calories, 95 grams of fat and 3,458 milligrams of sodium.  U.S. dietary guidelines recommend individuals consume no more than 2,000 calories, 65 grams of fat and 2,300 milligrams of sodium daily.

475,MCD,"Yum's U.S. woes, other data, point to weakness at McDonald's","(Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc’s disappointing Pizza Hut and Taco Bell results, along with other data, suggested the U.S. fast-food business remained weak in the second quarter and that industry leader McDonald’s Corp continues to struggle. The U.S. fast-food segment has lagged the broader restaurant sector, due to weak job growth and stagnant pay among the lower-wage diners who frequent such restaurants. The sector also is struggling to remain relevant as more consumers move away from decadent food like cheeseburgers and french fries to fresher, healthier fare.      “People want better food. Who loses? The fast-food guys are stuck,” Investment Technology Group restaurant analyst Steve West said. McDonald’s, the world’s biggest fast-food chain by revenue, has posted seven straight months of declines in U.S. sales at established restaurants.  The chain, which reports second-quarter results on Tuesday, recently transitioned from its “Dollar Menu” to the “Dollar and More” menu, effectively raising prices. That increased average checks but hurt traffic, West said. Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski, who publishes a closely watched McDonald’s franchisee survey, on Wednesday forecast a 2.6 percent drop in the chain’s U.S. same-restaurant sales for June, the final month of the second quarter.   “Customers with jobs are not choosing McDonald’s,” said one of the 27 franchisees who participated in Kalinowski’s survey. “When customers have money they choose others.”  Kalinowski does not expect McDonald’s woes to end in July. He forecast a 1.8 percent decline in July same-restaurant sales.     Worries are growing that overall U.S. restaurant industry sales did not bounce back from a dismal first quarter, when an Arctic blast of severe weather crushed results. U.S. restaurant same-store sales rose just 0.3 percent in the second quarter, just a slight improvement from the 0.2 percent decline in the first quarter, said Wallace Doolin, chief executive at Black Box Intelligence, which tracks 19,000 restaurants. “We were a little surprised. We thought Q2 would be stronger than it was,” said Doolin, who added that the recovery in fast food was less robust than in the fast-casual segment dominated by burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. Yum on Wednesday reported a 2 percent drop in second-quarter sales at established U.S. Pizza Hut restaurants, which continue to struggle. “We now expect full-year operating profit at Pizza Hut to fall well short of our initial expectations,” Yum Chief Executive David Novak said on a conference call with analysts on Thursday.  Taco Bell’s same-restaurant sales grew a weaker-than-expected 2 percent, as heavy promotion of its national breakfast rollout distracted from lunch and dinner. Its new Cool Ranch Spicy Doritos Locos Tacos Chicken also flopped. Taco Bell’s results improved versus the prior quarter, but  “were mixed in a challenging U.S. environment,” Yum Chief Financial Officer Patrick Grismer said on the conference call.

477,MCD,"Yum, McDonald's apologize as new China food scandal hits","SHANGHAI/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc and McDonald’s Corp are facing a new food safety scare in China, denting the fast-food companies’ efforts to shore up reputations and businesses that were hurt by a 2012 safety scandal in one of their biggest markets.  McDonald’s and KFC parent Yum apologized to customers on Monday after Chinese regulators shut a local meat supplier following a TV report that showed workers picking up meat from a factory floor, as well as mixing meat beyond its expiration date with fresh meat.  The companies said they immediately stopped using the supplier, Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, a unit of Aurora, Illinois-based OSI Group, and had switched to alternatives. They added that the factory served restaurants in the Shanghai area. The report on China’s Dragon TV brought Yum and McDonald’s  back into the firing line following the sales-battering 2012 scandal that involved chicken pumped with excessive amounts of antibiotics. “We will not tolerate any violations of government laws and regulations from our suppliers,” said Yum China, which required all of its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants to seal up and stop using all meat materials supplied by the Husi factory.   The division, Yum’s No. 1 business unit, had just seen its KFC restaurants bounce back from the double whammy of the food safety scare and a bird flu outbreak. “If proven, the practices outlined in the reports are completely unacceptable to McDonald’s anywhere in the world,” a China-based spokeswoman for McDonald’s told Reuters.  Husi provided McDonald’s with chicken, beef and lettuce, a McDonald’s U.S. spokeswoman said. China is McDonald’s third-biggest market as measured in number of restaurants.  “I think this is going to be really challenging for both these firms,” said Benjamin Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.    “I don’t know that this is something an apology can fix so easily, because at this point people don’t have a whole lot of trust that they have good systems in place,” he added. Yum shares fell 4.2 percent to close at $74.13 and McDonald’s shares lost 1.5 percent to $97.55. “Although the issue is being addressed, we would not rule out the possibility of temporary sales disruptions,” Baird analyst David Tarantino said in a research note lowering his target price on the company.     The Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration shut  Husi down on Sunday after the local Chinese TV broadcast aired. In addition to the meat safety violations, the program showed workers saying that if clients knew what they were doing, the firm would lose its contracts. OSI said on its Chinese website that management was “appalled by the report.” The company said it has formed its own investigation team, is fully cooperating with government inspectors and will take all necessary actions based on results of the investigation.    “Management believes this to be an isolated event, but takes full responsibility for the situation,” OSI said.  OSI, which has close to 60 manufacturing facilities worldwide and had revenue of more than $5 billion in 2012, has been supplying McDonald’s in China since 1992 and KFC and Pizza Hut parent Yum since 2008, according to its website. McDonald’s and Yum are the top two brands by sales in China’s $174 billion fast-food market, according to Euromonitor, but face a challenge as local firms try to tempt cost-conscious diners with healthy, home-grown fare.    Both companies said they are investigating the issues highlighted in the report and said that switching suppliers will cause some temporary product shortages. News of the scare spread quickly to diners negotiating Shanghai’s lunch-hour rush on Monday.  “For now I won’t go to eat at McDonald’s or KFC, at least until this whole thing settles down,” said Xu Xinyu, 24, a financial services worker, eating at a noodle shop near a McDonald’s outlet in downtown Shanghai. Yet Chinese consumers may already have developed a comparatively thick skin when it comes to food scandals. “Isn’t everywhere like this?” asked student Li Xiaoye, 20, eating a beef burger in a Shanghai McDonald’s outlet. “I’ll keep going because wherever I eat, the issues are all the same.”       The incident highlights the difficulty in ensuring quality and safety along the supply chain in China. Wal-Mart Stores Inc came under the spotlight this year after a supplier’s donkey meat product was found to contain fox meat. It also came under fire for selling expired duck meat in 2011. OSI is one of McDonald’s key meat suppliers and has a good reputation, according to an industry insider speaking on condition of anonymity. He added the incident highlights the issue firms face enforcing strict processes with local staff. As well as Yum and McDonald’s, OSI listed Starbucks Corp, Japan’s Saizeriya Co Ltd, Papa John’s International Inc, Burger King Worldwide Inc and Doctor’s Associates Inc’s Subway brand as clients in China, according to a 2012 press release. Burger King shares fell 1.6 percent to close at $26.13. A Starbucks spokesman told Reuters that the company does not now have any direct business dealings with Husi Food. Burger King, Subway, Papa John’s and Saizeriya did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The S&P; 500 fell as much as 0.6 percent, though it recovered most of those losses and closed right above its 14-day moving average, suggesting buyers were using weakness to come back into the market. Still, the day’s losses were broad, and nine of the 10 primary S&P; 500 sector indexes fell. The S&P; energy sector index represented the only positive group, up 0.2 percent. U.S. crude oil for August delivery shot up 1.4 percent to settle at $104.59 ahead of Tuesday’s contract expiry. Violence escalated in the Gaza Strip despite growing international calls for a cease-fire. The Palestinian death toll rose above 500 while Israel’s losses also mounted. While the impact to the U.S. economy is seen as minimal, investors are concerned about the fallout from an extended period of increased violence as well as the prospect that it could spread to other parts of the Middle East. Market participants also kept watch on the uncertain situation in Ukraine, where fighting flared in the city of Donetsk. Last week a Malaysian Airlines jet was shot down over Ukraine, adding to an already tense situation between the country and Russia. The United States and the European Union announced further economic sanctions against Russian interests last week before the Malaysian Airlines jet was shot down, and sanctions could become even more stringent. “We’re certainly paying attention to the issues abroad, but right now, they don’t seem like the kind of events that will have anything beyond a short-term impact,” said John Chisholm, chief investment officer at Acadian Asset Management in Boston. “We expect these uncertainties to be reversed in two or three weeks.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 48.45 points or 0.28 percent, to end at 17,051.73. The S&P; 500 declined 4.59 points or 0.23 percent, to finish at 1,973.63. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.44 points or 0.17 percent, to close at 4,424.70. The CBOE Volatility Index climbed 6.2 percent to 12.81, a level that is well below its historical average of 20. Some analysts have suggested that the low volatility has left the market - which hasn’t had a correction, defined as a 10 percent pullback, since October 2011 - vulnerable to a shock. “Markets aren’t particularly attractive, and it seems likely that we’ll see a correction of 10 to 15 percent, though the timing on that is very difficult to say,” Chisholm said. After the market closed, Netflix Inc reported a quarterly profit that more than doubled from a year ago, sending shares up 0.7 percent to $455.08 after the bell. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc jumped 9.3 percent to $644.50 after the market closed after reporting second-quarter revenue that sharply exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Texas Instruments Inc also reported second-quarter revenue that beat expectations after the market closed, but shares were flat at $49.17 in extended trading. During the regular session, Herbalife Ltd dropped 11 percent to $54.02 after Pershing Square’s Bill Ackman, who is short the stock, told CNBC he would present evidence on Tuesday that the company is an “incredible fraud.” McDonald’s Corp shares slid 1.5 percent to $97.55 and Yum Brands Inc shares fell 4.2 percent to $74.13 as the fast-food restaurant chains face a new food safety scare in China, denting efforts to shore up reputations hurt by a 2012 safety scandal in one of their biggest markets.

The CBOE Volatility Index climbed 6.2 percent to 12.81, a level that is well below its historical average of 20. Some analysts have suggested that the low volatility has left the market - which hasn’t had a correction, defined as a 10 percent pullback, since October 2011 - vulnerable to a shock. “Markets aren’t particularly attractive, and it seems likely that we’ll see a correction of 10 to 15 percent, though the timing on that is very difficult to say,” Chisholm said.

Israeli jets, tanks and artillery pounded Gaza again as the death toll from a two-week conflict topped 500 amid growing international calls for a ceasefire. Fighters from Hamas, which controls Gaza, have repeatedly tried to infiltrate Israel over the past week through hidden tunnels. Fighting flared in the Ukrainian city of Donetsk as investigators began to inspect the bodies of victims of a Malaysia Airlines jet shot down last week. The United States and its allies have pointed the finger at pro-Russian rebels and at Moscow itself over the downing of the plane with 298 people aboard. Russia has denied involvement and blamed the Ukrainian military. The United States and the EU last week announced further economic sanctions against Russian interests before the jet was shot down, and sanctions could become even more stringent. However, the effect on the U.S. or the global economy continues to be seen as limited. The situations in Gaza and Ukraine “are both quite serious, but at this point unlikely to derail the U.S. economy,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. “Earnings have been good and there’s the Fed’s continued support. Investors are trying to balance out the support for the U.S. market with the risks the geopolitical tension brings.” U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday that Russia and President Vladimir Putin have direct responsibility to compel separatists to cooperate with an investigation into the plane crash. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 75.91 points or 0.44 percent, to 17,024.27, the S&P; 500 lost 8.75 points or 0.44 percent, to 1,969.47 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 19.54 points or 0.44 percent, to 4,412.60. The S&P; had sold of Thursday after news the Malaysian jet was shot down, falling 1 percent for the first time since April 10. On Friday, the index then rose more than 1 percent for the first time since April 16. On Thursday, the CBOE Volatility Index had jumped 32 percent before retreating 17 percent on Friday. On Monday, it rose 10 percent but at 13.3 remains well below its historical average of 20. “When you have interest rates as low as they are it really dampens stock market volatility tremendously,” Meckler said. “It takes very significant, serious international activity to change that volatility level.” EMC Corp rose 3.8 percent to $28 after Elliott Management Corp acquired a $1 billion stake. The activist investor plans to push the data storage equipment maker to spin off its majority-owned VMware Inc unit, the Wall Street Journal reported. VMWare shares fell 0.8 percent to $94.56.

484,MCD,"Yum, McDonald's in Shanghai food safety investigation","SHANGHAI, July 21 (Reuters) - U.S. fast food chains McDonald’s Corp and Yum! Brands Inc said they will stop using products supplied by a local meat processor after a Shanghai regulator halted the firm’s operations on Sunday over food safety concerns. The move is a potential concern for the two brands, which are both now conducting their own investigation into the matter, since the pair were hit hard by a food safety scandal in China late in 2012. Yum, which apologised to Chinese consumers for any inconvenience caused in the latest case, suffered a sharp dive in profits early in 2013 after the safety concerns. The Shanghai Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) halted the operations of Shanghai Husi Food Co., Ltd, a meat supplier suspected of providing meat that had passed its expiration date to China branches of McDonald’s restaurants and Yum’s KFC and Pizza Hut outlets, the Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday. The SFDA inspected Shanghai Husi on Sunday evening after a local television channel broadcast a programme claiming an undercover reporter had seen the use of expired meat and poor hygiene practices in a local factory, local media said. Yum and McDonald’s both said they have stopped using meat products purchased from Shanghai Husi, according to statements posted on their official Weibo microblog sites.

Weakness in the world’s biggest hamburger chain’s two top markets, coupled with its warning of a global fall in same-restaurant sales for July, also helped send McDonald’s shares down 1.1 percent in early trading on Tuesday. McDonald’s gets about 30 percent of its revenue from the United States, where sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell 1.5 percent in the second quarter. Traffic remained depressed amid tough competition from a range of rivals, which include Wendy’s Co, Burger King Worldwide Inc and privately held Chick-fil-A. Analysts had expected McDonald’s U.S. comparable sales to fall just 0.3 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. McDonald’s results stood in sharp contrast to Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, which on Monday reported a 17.3 percent jump in same-restaurant sales at its predominantly U.S. burrito restaurants. McDonald’s said ongoing weakness in Germany was partly to blame for the 1 percent same-restaurant sales decline in Europe, which just beats out the United States as the fast-food chain’s top revenue market. Analysts had expected a gain of 0.7 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. The Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region rose 1.1 percent. The results got a boost from China, which just recovered from food safety and bird flu scares but now is embroiled in a new controversy over a major supplier’s meat handling methods.

486,MCD,"China food scandal spreads, drags in Starbucks, Burger King and McNuggets in Japan","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The latest food scandal in China is spreading fast, dragging in U.S. coffee chain Starbucks, Burger King Worldwide Inc and others, as well as McDonald’s products as far away as Japan. McDonald’s Corp and KFC’s parent Yum Brands Inc apologized to Chinese customers on Monday after it emerged that Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, a unit of U.S.-based OSI Group LLC, had supplied expired meat to the two chains. On Tuesday, Starbucks said some of its cafes previously sold products containing chicken originally sourced from Shanghai Husi, a firm that was shut down on Sunday by local regulators after a TV report showed staff using expired meat and picking up meat from the floor to add to the mix. A Tokyo-based spokesman at McDonald’s Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd said the company had sourced about a fifth of its Chicken McNuggets from Shanghai Husi and had halted sales of the product on Monday. Alternative supplies of chicken have been found in Thailand and China, he added. The company’s shares briefly fell as much as 1.4 percent to a 15-month low before closing down 0.4 percent. China’s food watchdog said it ordered regional offices to carry out spot checks on all firms which had used Shanghai Husi products, and would inspect all of parent OSI’s sites around China to see if enough has been done to ensure food safety. It said the case could be handed over to the police. The regulator’s Shanghai branch said in a statement on Tuesday it had demanded production, quality control and sales records from OSI. It added it already ordered McDonald’s to seal over 4,500 boxes of suspected meat products and Yum’s Pizza Hut to seal over 500 boxes of beef. Fast-food chain Burger King and Dicos, China’s third-ranked fast food chain owned by Ting Hsin International, said they would remove Shanghai Husi food products from their outlets. Pizza chain Papa John’s International Inc said on its Weibo blog that it had taken down all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi and cut ties with the supplier. Food safety is one of the top issues for Chinese consumers after a scandal in 2008 where dairy products tainted with the industrial chemical melamine led to the deaths of six infants and made many thousands sick. Other food scandals have hit the meat and dairy industries in recent years, and many Chinese look to foreign brands as offering higher safety standards.  China is McDonald’s third-biggest market by number of restaurants and Yum’s top market by revenue. McDonald’s is due to report quarterly earnings later on Tuesday. The scare has stirred local consumers and become one of the most discussed topics online among the country’s influential ‘netizens’, with some users spreading long lists of firms thought to be tarnished. The incident highlights the difficulty in ensuring quality and safety along the supply chain in China. Wal-Mart Stores Inc came under the spotlight early this year after a supplier’s donkey meat product was found to contain fox meat. It also came under fire for selling expired duck meat in 2011. Starbucks said on its Chinese microblog site that it had no direct business relationship with Shanghai Husi, but that some of its chicken acquired from another supplier had originally come from Husi for its “Chicken Apple Sauce Panini” products. This had been sold in 13 different provinces and major cities. The company added that all the products had already been removed from its shelves. Burger King said in a Weibo statement posted late on Monday that it had taken off its shelves all meat products supplied by Shanghai Husi Food and had launched an investigation. Dicos said it pulled all ham products supplied by Shanghai Husi, and would stop serving its ham sandwich product for breakfast. “We will continue to carry out a probe into Shanghai Husi Food and its related firms, to understand whether or not it followed national regulations,” Dicos said in a statement. Swedish furniture firm IKEA [IKEA.UL], which has in-store food outlets, said on Weibo that Shanghai Husi had previously been a supplier, but had not provided the firm with products since September last year. Domino’s Pizza Inc and Doctor’s Associates Inc’s Subway brand, which were named in online reports as being supplied meat from Shanghai Husi, said their outlets in China did not use meat products from the firm. Yoshinoya-parent Hop Hing Group Holdings Ltd, Japanese convenience store FamilyMart Co Ltd and Chinese chain Wallace urged diners not to worry, and said they did not currently use any products from Shanghai Husi.

492,MCD,"UPDATE 2-Chipotle customers shrug off price hike, flock to burrito chain","(Adds industry context, analyst and company comment, byline) By Lisa Baertlein July 21 (Reuters) - Burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  last quarter achieved what many of its rivals could only dream of: It raised prices, yet attracted more diners during a period of sluggish economic growth. The Denver-based chain on Monday reported a nearly 26 percent jump in second-quarter profit after sales at established restaurants surged 17.3 percent. The better-than-expected results prompted Chipotle to boost its full-year same-restaurant sales forecast, and its shares rose almost 10 percent in after-hours trading to $648.80. Chipotle is known for serving antibiotic-free meats and organic produce, which appeal to trend-setting teen and young adult diners. Investors love the chain because its restaurants crank out more and more sales without increasing costs. Rival Panera Bread Co was on a similar trajectory until last year, when “operational friction” caused it to stumble on speed. Executives at Chipotle said speed of service is at record levels, due to its focus on nurturing top-performing staff and its use of technology that helps analyze and improve performance. “We are the fastest we have ever been at lunch time and at dinner time, but the averages throughout the entire day are speeding up as well,” Chipotle co-Chief Executive Monty Moran said on a conference call with analysts. And, he said, service can get faster still. Investment Technology Group restaurant analyst Steve West agreed. “I wouldn’t bet against Chipotle until they prove otherwise,” said West, who noted that bears for years have wagered that Chipotle would hit its limit on service times. Based on last quarter’s gains, Chipotle raised its forecast for 2014 same-restaurant sales growth to a mid-teen percentage range, from a single digit estimate previously. The company is an outlier in the U.S. restaurant industry, whose same-store sales rose just 0.3 percent in the second quarter, according to Black Box Intelligence, which tracks 19,000 restaurants. It is difficult for restaurants to raise prices when same-store sales growth is anemic, and McDonald’s executives likely will face pricing questions after the company reports quarterly results on Tuesday morning. Chipotle boosted prices to help offset higher costs for ingredients like beef, avocados and dairy. While more people ate at the chain, some diners did switch from pricey beef to lower-cost chicken, executives said. Chipotle also has begun buying grass-fed, antibiotic-free beef from Australia to help ease tight supplies, co-Chief Executive Steve Ells said. Chipotle’s stock, which was trading at around $400 a year ago, closed at $589.93 on Monday, valuing the company at more than $18 billion. That was twice as much Burger King Worldwide , but still significantly less than former owner McDonald’s Corp, with its market value of more than $96 billion.

493,MCD,WRAPUP 2-Yum cuts ties to owner of China meat plant after scandal,"* OSI Group: China authorities inspected all other factories; no more problems found * McDonald’s shifts OSI business to inspected plants; Yum ends OSI relationship * Five detained Shanghai Husi staff include head and quality chief -police * Food-safety violations at Husi were company-led, not individual acts -watchdog * Over 1,000 tonnes of suspect meat products sealed from OSI in China   (Adds statements from Yum, McDonald’s and OSI Group) By Brenda Goh and Paul Carsten SHANGHAI/LANGFANG, China,  July 23 (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc severed ties with OSI Group after Shanghai police detained five people from the supplier’s China meat-processing factory at the center of a food-safety scare that has ensnared several major Western brands. Shanghai police said on Wednesday the five individuals being held included the head of Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd as well as its quality manager. “Yum China has decided to immediately terminate all procurement from OSI China,” including Shanghai Husi, Yum said in a statement. OSI China and its Shanghai Husi business are part of Aurora, Illinois-based OSI Group LLC, which said in a statement that local Chinese authorities have inspected all of its other facilities in China and found no issues. Based on that statement, McDonald’s Corp said it was maintaining its relationship with OSI Group. The world’s biggest hamburger chain, which has just over 2,000 restaurants in China, said it would transfer its business in affected markets to Husi’s new plant in the eastern central province of Henan. And, until that process is completed, McDonald’s said it would continue to buy food from Husi’s factory in the northern province of Hebei. OSI Group Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sheldon Lavin apologized to its China customers in a statement on Wednesday and reiterated that he has teams on the ground to address the problems. “What happened at Husi Shanghai is completely unacceptable,” Lavin said. “We will bear the responsibility of these missteps, and will make sure that they never happen again.” KFC and Pizza Hut parent Yum, McDonald’s and coffee chain Starbucks Corp are among the global brands that pulled products from their outlets after the news broke that Shanghai Husi supplied expired meat to clients in China as well as in Japan, in the latest in a series of food scandals in the country. Earlier, the official Xinhua news agency cited the Shanghai food and drug watchdog as saying that food-safety violations at Shanghai Husi were company-led rather than the acts of individuals. In its statement, Yum said: “It is difficult to believe and completely unacceptable that the management of Shanghai Husi ... would oversee and organize illegal and dishonest operations.” Yum, which has 6,400 restaurants in China, also terminated its relationship with OSI in Australia and the United States. Yum said that OSI is not a major supplier and that ending the partnerships with OSI should not disrupt its business. A Chinese TV report on Sunday set off a storm of controversy after it showed staff at the Shanghai Husi facility using meat that had expired and had been lying on the floor. Huang Denggang, 20, worked as a night cleaner at that Husi plant, a modern warehouse compound in a Shanghai suburb, for more than a year, but does not plan to return when it reopens because of lower-than-expected pay and a medical claim. He told Reuters on Wednesday that he had seen workers pick up raw meat from the floor and put it back into processing containers. “The leader didn’t say anything when you throw it back,” he said at a local job agency where he works during the day. Huang, who showed Reuters his Husi payslip as verification of his employment there, also said he had seen some workers handling raw meat without wearing gloves. “If you wear gloves,” he said, “maybe it slows you down if you want to pick up the chicken pieces because they’re slippery.” He added, however, that he did not work in that part of the factory. Another Husi worker, who gave only the surname Zhang, said by telephone that he had worked on the production line, breaking up chicken into pieces, but had quit because of the low pay. “When (raw meat) drops, they usually don’t see it, and even if they do, it was fine to pick it up and put it back,” he said. “There was an attitude of ‘it doesn’t really matter.’” The former employees’ comments contrasted with what one worker at another of OSI’s food-processing plants in Langfang in the northern Chinese province of Hebei told Reuters. He said that rules there were very strict, all workers needed to wear special clothes, and unannounced spot checks were often held. “The inspections are done by everyone: our own company, the government and also clients like McDonald’s,” said the worker, surnamed Wei, as he took a break at a nearby supermarket. He said the Hebei factory, which according to its website processes meat, vegetables and flour products, was still open for business despite government inspections. Xinhua also cited Gu Zhenhua, deputy head of the Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration, as saying that Shanghai Husi’s controls systems and records for suspected products violated Chinese regulations. In the Dragon TV documentary on Sunday, staff at the Shanghai Husi facility said they kept two record books on food products, one of which was doctored to be shown to anyone who came to audit the facility. According to the report, which claimed to show an inspection of the facility by McDonald’s, Shanghai Husi staff learned of the visit a day in advance and made sure that only compliant products were being processed on the day. The Shanghai food watchdog also said it had sealed more than 1,000 tonnes of suspected meat products from OSI in China and another 100 tonnes of products from various customers.

Stocks had opened higher on strong job market data in the United States and overseas factory readings, while Facebook shares rallied after results beat expectations. Jobless claims fell to the lowest since mid-February 2006, pointing to continued strength in the labor market, but new home sales fell 8.1 percent in June, the most in almost a year, and May’s initial reading of a more than 18 percent gain was revised to just above 8 percent, putting a damper on sentiment as the housing market struggles. “Housing certainly seems to be the one theme that prevents this economic recovery and earnings story from being a fairly tale, it is the one reminder there are issues,” said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York. He said the bullishness behind the strong job numbers was partly offset by market concern that it could translate into a faster route to normalizing monetary policy. However, earnings season is “really quite solid, largely hitting on all cylinders in terms of top and bottom line and revenue growth.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.51 points or 0.04 percent, to 17,094.14, the S&P; 500 gained 0.66 points or 0.03 percent, to 1,987.67 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 4.10 points or 0.09 percent, to 4,469.60. At its session high, the S&P; was 0.5 percent away from hitting 2,000. Facebook was the poster child for strong earnings following a better-than-forecast 61 percent increase in revenue during the second quarter. Shares jumped 5.6 percent to $75.30, giving the social media giant a market capitalization of $193 billion, roughly the sum of Dow components McDonald’s  and UTX. Sports apparel manufacturer and retailer Under Armour  jumped 10.5 percent to $67 after quarterly revenue rose by more than a third. On the flip side D.R. Horton, the No.1 U.S. homebuilder, fell 8 percent to $22.77 after it reported a 23 percent slump in third-quarter profit. The housing data also hurt homebuilders, with a sector index  down 1.6 percent. Ford shares rose 1.4 percent to $18.03 after profit beat expectations while GM dropped 4 percent to $35.87 on a lower second-quarter profit due to numerous recalls and the expected cost of at least $400 million for its victims’ compensation fund. Drugmakers Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly  both beat Wall Street expectations, helped by cost controls. Bristol shares edged up 0.4 percent to $49.54 and Eli Lilly dipped 0.3 percent to $64.03. Markets earlier got support from an expansion in China’s factory activity and the euro zone’s private sector.

498,MCD,McDonald's CEO: 'deceived' by audit of China meat plant,"(Reuters) - (This version of the story was corrected to remove the phrase “on its behalf” in paragraph four. It is not known who ordered the audit.) McDonald’s Corp feels “a bit deceived” by the audit it received for Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, a China supplier that was shut down this week after a TV report showed workers mishandling meat, Chief Executive Don Thompson said on Tuesday. “We are no longer serving product from the primary facility there that has the challenges and the issues,” Thompson said on a conference call after McDonald’s reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. The Shanghai Food and Drug Administration on Sunday halted operations of Shanghai Husi following a Dragon TV report that showed workers picking up meat from a factory floor, as well as mixing fresh meat with meat beyond its expiration date. The scandal also has ensnared other Shanghai Husi customers, including KFC parent Yum Brands Inc and Burger King Worldwide Inc.  Many U.S. restaurant operators and retailers rely on third-party auditors to check whether their suppliers comply with food safety rules and other regulations. It is not uncommon for suppliers at the center of food safety scandals to have received high marks on their audits. McDonald’s did not immediately comment on the timing of the Shanghai Husi audit or the name of the auditing firm that visited the now-controversial plant. Shanghai Husi, a unit of Illinois-based OSI Group, has supplied those McDonald’s China restaurants since the early 1990s, a U.S. spokeswoman for the fast-food company said on Tuesday.   China is McDonald’s third-biggest market as measured by the  number of restaurants. “I know there’s a couple other facilities that they had that have been cleared now by the Chinese government,” Thompson said, without elaborating. It was not immediately clear whether McDonald’s had stopped sourcing products from those other facilities. OSI, which previously said it believed the Shanghai Husi incident to be an “isolated event,” did not have an immediate response to the comments by the McDonald’s CEO. A U.S. spokeswoman for McDonald’s on Monday said Shanghai Husi provided McDonald’s with chicken, beef and lettuce, and that the facility shown in the television report primarily supplied McDonald’s in Shanghai. A Tokyo-based spokesman at McDonald’s Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd said the company had sourced about a fifth of its Chicken McNuggets from Shanghai Husi and had halted sales of the product on Monday. Alternative chicken supplies were found in Thailand and China, he added.  McDonald’s and OSI are known in the industry for having a long relationship. OSI’s chairman and chief executive, Sheldon Lavin, is a member of the board of trustees for the Ronald McDonald’s House Charities.

501,MCD,Meat supplier in China food scandal grew with McDonald's,"(Reuters) - Eight months ago in front of a crowd of food industry executives gathered at a fancy Chicago hotel, a top McDonald’s Corp executive lauded the boss of meat supplier OSI Group for his dedication to the fast-food giant’s “McFamily”. On Wednesday, McDonald’s stood by its long-time business partner OSI in the face of a deepening food safety scandal at a unit of OSI in China where five people are detained. Fast food chain KFC’s parent Yum Brands cut ties to OSI, but the history of McDonald’s and OSI are more deeply intertwined. Illinois-based OSI’ octogenarian owner, Sheldon Lavin, has built an empire in China over the past 20 years, largely on the back of business from the Golden Arches. Privately held OSI, little known outside of the tight-knit food industry, has worked with McDonald’s for nearly 60 years. Lavin was “appalled” at a report on China’s Dragon TV that showed workers at an OSI unit, Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, processing out-of-date meat and meat that had fallen on the factory floor, he said in a statement on Wednesday. OSI declined to comment on company plans or history. A former banker, Lavin initially worked as a consultant for OSI, joining full time in the 1970s at the request of McDonald’s. He took control in the 1980s, according to industry magazines, which did not describe how Lavin became owner. He focused aggressively on expanding in China, telling employees in the early 1980s: “I don’t care if we sell the erasers off pencils; we are going to China,” according to a 2012 article in The National Provisioner magazine. OSI grew out of Otto & Sons, a meat business founded in Chicago in 1909 by German butcher Otto Kolschowsky, the magazine said in a 2004 article. In 1955, Kolschowsky’s grandsons struck a deal to be the restaurant’s first supplier of fresh hamburgers, the article said. “When I really took control in the 80s, I decided there was no reason for me to stay if I didn’t build OSI into something big,” Lavin said in a 2013 interview with Independent Processor magazine. He boasted the company became “the largest protein supplier in the world to the McDonald’s system.” In November 2013, Lavin was inducted into the Meat Industry Hall of Fame at the Drake Hotel in Chicago, and McDonald’s USA President Jeff Stratton praised his commitment to family, including the “McFamily” of McDonald’s, and community service,     according to an account of the event on OSI’s website.  Even Lavin’s community service is tied to McDonald’s: he is on the board of trustees for the Ronald McDonald’s House Charities. OSI, which had $6.1 billion in sales last year, has more than 50 facilities in 17 countries. McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant company by revenues, has outlets in more than 100 countries. It declined to comment on the value of its contracts with OSI. OSI opened its first plant in China in 1992, just two years after McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in the country. It was one of the food suppliers for the Beijing Olympics in 2008, according to the OSI website. The fast-food giant will buy food from other OSI units in China while OSI’s Shanghai Husi is closed, McDonald’s said on Wednesday. A day earlier, McDonald’s CEO Don Thompson said he felt “deceived” by an audit for Shanghai Husi Food, made by a third party company, that did not reveal the problems. Yum is finding different suppliers to replace OSI, which provided food to the restaurant chain in China, Australia and the United States. Yum said OSI was not among its major suppliers. OSI buys meat from the world’s biggest producers, including Cargill Inc, churns it into hamburger patties and chicken nuggets, and then sells the products to restaurants. OSI also sells fruit and vegetables. Lavin takes pride in the Illinois-based company’s low profile, telling The National Provisioner in 2004 that OSI was “one of the biggest companies in the world that no-one has ever heard of.” OSI until this week’s scandal has largely kept out of the public eye, with few recalls of food or transgressions, according to searches of government and regulatory websites. A subsidiary, Carolina Culinary Foods, recalled about 2.8 million pounds of fully cooked chicken breast strips sold by Oscar Mayer/Louis Rich in 2007 because they might have been contaminated with listeria. The bacteria can cause serious illness for people with weakened immune systems, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in a recall notice issued at the time, said the health risk was high. Otherwise, the company has a mostly clean record in the United States, industry executives said. Chuck Jolley, president of the Meat Industry Hall of Fame, said he was shocked when he read OSI was at the center of the scandal in China. “I had to go back and double check” it was OSI, he said. OSI has other units in China, which are still working, and Dave Theno, a former senior vice-president for product quality and safety at fast food company Jack in the Box, said the company’s priority was to get the Shanghai plant back to work serving McDonald’s. “Job No. 1 for them is to get the problem behind them and see if they can’t get it requalified to supply those guys,” he said.

Chuck Jolley, president of the Meat Industry Hall of Fame, said he was shocked when he read OSI was at the center of the scandal in China. “I had to go back and double check” it was OSI, he said. OSI has other units in China, which are still working, and Dave Theno, a former senior vice-president for product quality and safety at fast food company Jack in the Box, said the company’s priority was to get the Shanghai plant back to work serving McDonald’s. “Job No. 1 for them is to get the problem behind them and see if they can’t get it requalified to supply those guys,” he said.

504,MCD,Russia takes aim at McDonald's burgers as U.S. ties worsen,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - McDonald’s burgers and shakes may become the latest victims of worsening ties between Moscow and Washington after a Russian consumer watchdog agency accused the U.S. chain of sanitary violations. McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), which opened its first Russian restaurant in Moscow in 1990, became an iconic symbol of flourishing American capitalism during the fall of the Soviet Union. But its Golden Arches may be in the Kremlin’s crosshairs as ties between Moscow and Washington have fallen to their lowest point since the end of the Cold War with consecutive rounds of U.S. sanctions over Russia’s role in the Ukraine crisis. “We have identified violations which put the product quality and safety of the entire McDonald’s chain in doubt,” Anna Popova, the watchdog’s head and Russia’s chief sanitary inspector, was quoted by Interfax news agency as saying. The watchdog agency Rospotrebnadzor has previously been accused of acting in the political interests of the Kremlin, banning Georgian wine as Tbilisi strengthened ties with Washington and spirits from Moldova after the former Soviet republic boosted its drive to partner with the European Union. A Moscow court told Reuters a regional branch of Rospotrebnadzor had asked it to declare production and sales of some McDonald’s products illegal after the watchdog agency carried out inspections of McDonald’s restaurants last June. The regulator says the company is deceiving consumers about the energy value of its Cheeseburger Royales, Filet-o-Fish, Cheeseburgers and Chicken Burgers and about nutritional value of its milkshakes and ice creams. Its also said in a statement that Caesar wrap sandwiches and a vegetable salad were contaminated with coliform bacteria, which indicates the likelihood of food poisoning. McDonald’s, which boasts of long lines at its restaurants across Moscow, some of which sit in view of the Kremlin’s red walls, said it had not received any complaint from the regulator and had no information about the lawsuit.     “For the 25 years that McDonald’s has been working in the Russian market, its main priority has been to provide quality and safe products to our visitors,” the company said by email. It added that its calculations of energy and nutritional value were based on the methodologies approved by state Russian institution. The court will hold a preliminary hearing on Aug. 13 with the key hearing likely to be scheduled for September, the court’s spokeswoman said. McDonald’s operates about 400 restaurants in Russia and sees the country as one of its top seven major markets outside the United States and Canada, according to its 2013 annual report. The fast-food chain has often become subject to boycotts in various countries to oppose U.S. actions. In 2003, French boycotted McDonald’s to protest against the war in Iraq.

506,MCD,"UPDATE 2-In China meat scandal, McDonald's Japan switches to Thai chicken, no nuggets in Hong Kong","(Adds McDonald’s Japan shifting overseas sourcing of chicken products to Thailand from China) HONG KONG, July 25 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp has suspended sales of chicken nuggets and other items in Hong Kong after it said it imported products from Shanghai Husi Food, the U.S.-owned Chinese company at the centre of a food safety scare in China. McDonald’s said it imported certain products from Shanghai Husi between July last year and June this year, although no food items from the Shanghai supplier remained in stock. In Japan, McDonald’s Holdings Co (Japan) said on Friday it would halt all imports of chicken products from China and shift that business to Thailand, boosting purchases from existing suppliers McKey Foods Services (Thailand) Ltd, a unit of Keystone Foods, and Cargill Thailand. Last year, Thailand supplied 62 percent of McDonald’s Japan’s chicken product imports, with China supplying the remainder. McDonald’s Japan said earlier this week that it sourced about a fifth of its Chicken McNuggets from Shanghai Husi and had halted sales of the product on Monday. The food scandal broke after a TV report on Sunday showed staff at Shanghai Husi Food using long expired meat and picking up food from the floor to add back to the mix. The fast-food company said in Hong Kong it had also stopped selling its McSpicy chicken filets, chicken and green salads, fresh corn cups and iced lemon tea. McDonald’s said it had stopped using the following ingredients from another branch, Guangzhou Husi: lettuce, corn kernels, lemon slices, green salad, cucumber, onion and tomato. “We reiterate that until today, all the food sold at McDonald’s restaurants conform to the food safety standard under Hong Kong legal regulations,” McDonald’s said. The announcement came after Hong Kong said it had suspended all imports from Shanghai Husi Food, which is owned by Illinois-based OSI Group. Hong Kong’s Centre for Food Safety said in a statement late on Thursday that any food products from Husi already imported into the city would be marked, sealed and banned from sale, pending the results of investigations by Chinese authorities. China is McDonald’s third-biggest market as measured by the number of restaurants. The latest food safety scare in China has also ensnared KFC parent Yum Brands Inc, which has required all its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants to seal up and stop using all meat materials supplied by the Husi factory. There have been no reports of any consumers falling sick in the latest food scare. Food safety is one of the top issues for Chinese consumers after a scandal in 2008 where dairy products tainted with the industrial chemical melamine led to the deaths of six infants and made many thousands sick.

507,MCD,REFILE-Russian consumer watchdog seeks ban on some McDonald's products,"(Refiles with correct name) MOSCOW, July 25 (Reuters) - Russia’s consumer protection agency has filed a lawsuit in a Moscow court seeking to ban some of McDonald’s Corp’s burgers along with its milk shakes and ice cream, a court spokeswoman said on Friday. A regional branch of the consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadzor asked the court to declare production and sales of some products illegal due to “inappropriate physical-chemical parameters,” she told Reuters. The lawsuit’s list of contested products named the fast-food chain’s Royal Cheeseburger, Filet-o-Fish, Cheeseburger and Chicken Burger but not its Big Mac burger. McDonald’s said in a statement it had not received any  complaint from the agency and had no information about the lawsuit. It said its food was produced according to methods approved by Russian authorities. The lawsuit comes three months after the fast-food chain  decided to close its restaurants in Crimea, the Ukraine region whose annexation by Russia in March triggered U.S. and European sanctions. At the time, some Russian politicians called for all McDonald’s outlets in Russia to be shut.

509,MCD,UPDATE 1-U.S. group overhauls China business in meat safety scandal,"* Issues at unit “absolutely inconsistent” with OSI values * China ops to come under direct control of U.S. headquarters * OSI to set up quality control centre; launch education campaign * McDonald’s drops some meat items, draws on supplier network   (Adds comments from OSI executives, details) By Samuel Shen and Kazunori Takada SHANGHAI, July 28 (Reuters) - A leading U.S. meat supplier said on Monday that a Chinese unit at the centre of a food safety scandal had issues that were “absolutely inconsistent” with the group’s high standards. “This is my company and events like these have a personal toll ... they simply don’t represent the values I stand for or those of my company,” Sheldon Lavin, the millionaire chairman, CEO and owner of Illinois-based OSI Group LLC told a news conference in Shanghai. OSI said it was suspending operations at Shanghai Husi Food and would review all its China plants in a bid to limit further damage after losing two major customers. KFC and Pizza Hut parent Yum Brands Inc last week severed its ties with OSI, while the Japan and Hong Kong units of McDonald’s Corp said they were ending their relationship with the U.S. meat processor’s Chinese unit following allegations it mixed expired meat with fresh produce. David McDonald, OSI’s president and chief operating officer, said the group was making senior management changes in China, and will set up a quality control centre in Shanghai to better supervise its business. It will also bring in global experts to survey the China operations and improve auditing, including constant visual surveillance and extensive employee interviews. In addition, it plans to spend 10 million yuan ($1.62 million) on a food safety education programme in Shanghai. OSI, which ranks among the top few dozen U.S. private companies with annual revenue of close to $6 billion, said its China operations had a certain amount of autonomy as the group wanted a decentralised business model that allowed decisions to be made locally, although global standards were not meant to be broken. McDonald said the China operations would come under the direct control of headquarters. Shanghai Husi Food was accused earlier this month by a TV documentary of mixing expired meat with fresh produce and forging production dates. Regulators in Shanghai said Husi had forged the dates on smoked beef patties and then sold them after they expired. Police have detained five people as part of their investigation. There have been no reports of any consumers falling sick. “To date, we’ve found issues that are absolutely inconsistent with our internal requirements for the highest standards, processes and policies,” McDonald told a packed news conference at a Shanghai hotel, adding all nine OSI food processing plants in China would be reviewed. China is McDonald’s third biggest market by outlets and Yum’s largest and is a big growth opportunity for foreign fast-food chains. But a series of damaging food safety scandals in recent years risks denting those prospects as many Chinese look to foreign restaurants for better quality. McDonald’s, which has more than 2,000 outlets in mainland China, took more meat dishes off its menus on Monday as it sought to fill the supply gap after OSI withdrew all Shanghai Husi products from the market at the weekend. At least three McDonald’s outlets in Shanghai and Beijing, visited by Reuters reporters on Monday, had stopped selling all or most of their meat products. Outlets in cities such as Tianjin and Wuhan were also hit, according to microblog postings. A spokeswoman at McDonald’s in China said its beef, chicken and pork products were affected at outlets across the country, though the level of impact varied. In an emailed statement, McDonald’s said it had withdrawn all products from the Husi group in China since Friday. “As a result, we are now only offering a limited menu in our restaurants around the country.” The company said some of its China restaurants would resume offering a full menu in early August, while others may take a little longer. “I wanted to order chicken products today,” said Tan Qiang, 23, at a McDonald’s in central Shanghai. “But they only had one type of combo and nothing else. I was disappointed not being able to eat what I want.”   (Additional reporting by Paul Carsten in BEIJING; Donny Kwok, James Zhang and Nikki Sun in HONG KONG; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Ian Geoghegan)",7282014,http://www.reuters.com/article/china-food/update-1-u-s-group-overhauls-china-business-in-meat-safety-scandal-idUSL4N0Q31OC20140728
510,MCD,U.S. food group CEO to brief media as McDonald's feels pinch in China food scandal,"SHANGHAI, July 28 (Reuters) - The head of U.S. meat supplier OSI Group, the parent company of a Chinese firm at the centre of a food safety scandal, will hold a news conference in Shanghai later on Monday, as McDonald’s Corp struck more meat dishes off its menus in China. Sheldon Lavin, the millionaire chairman, CEO and owner of Illinois-based OSI, apologised last week for the scandal at Shanghai Husi Food which has prompted several fast-food brands to drop its products from outlets in China, Japan and Hong Kong and switch suppliers. OSI said over the weekend it would take all products made by Shanghai Husi Food off the market as it carries out an internal investigation and brings in a new management team. Lavin and OSI executives have scheduled their news conference for 2.30 p.m. (0630 GMT) at a Shanghai hotel, a China-based OSI official said. At least three McDonald’s outlets in Shanghai and Beijing, visited by Reuters reporters on Monday, had stopped selling all or most of their meat products.

I won’t accept their apologies.” The food scandal has dragged in other global food brands such as KFC and Pizza Hut parent Yum Brands Inc and coffee chain Starbucks Corp.

511,MCD,"McDonald's, not only franchisees, liable in worker complaints -NLRB","July 29 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp, not just its franchisees, can be held liable in complaints that the company violated employee rights, an official at the U.S. National Labor Relations Board said in a letter made public on Tuesday. NLRB general counsel Richard Griffin Jr. wrote in the letter that of the 181 complaints filed against the fast-food chain  since November 2012 in connection with employee protests, 43 had merit. McDonald’s will be named as a joint respondent in those cases if they are not settled, Griffin wrote. Christine Owens, the executive director of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers, said the McDonald’s must be held accountable for its franchisees. The NLRB decision means corporations “cannot feign ignorance or disclaim responsibility for franchisees’ illegal acts, especially when those acts flow from the business model the lead company imposes,” she said In a statement, McDonald’s senior vice president of human resources, Heather Smedstad, said the NLRB decision was wrong and the company would contest it. McDonald’s relationship with its franchisees does not establish a joint employer relationship, Smedstad said. The NLRB decision “changes the rules for thousands of small businesses, and goes against decades of established law regarding the franchise model in the United States,” Smedstad said. McDonald’s, the world’s biggest restaurant operator by revenue, has been at the center a national debate on pay inequality at a time when many middle- to low-income Americans are struggling to make ends meet. According to the NLRB letter, 68 complaints against McDonald’s had no merit, and 64 are still under investigation.

512,MCD,"In China food testing, safety inspectors are often one step behind","SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - When inspectors visited Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd earlier this summer, the production line at the plant now at the centre of an international food scandal appeared in good order, with fresh meat being handled by properly-attired workers and supervisors keeping a watchful eye over the process. However, if they had arrived unannounced a day before, they would have found piles of blue plastic bags filled with out-of-date meat stacked around the factory floor, a worker at the facility told Reuters, adding the old meat was often added back into the mix to boost production and cut costs. “The next day, that meat just disappeared - someone must have disposed of it. The manager said it was an inspection,” said the worker, who wasn’t authorised to talk to the media and so didn’t want to be named. On July 20, following an undercover local TV report that alleged workers used expired meat and doctored food production dates, regulators closed the factory, which is part of OSI Group LLC, a U.S. food supplier. Police have detained five people including Shanghai Husi’s head and quality manager. The scandal - which has hit mainly big foreign fast-food brands including McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N), which owns the KFC and Pizza Hut chains - underlines the challenges facing inspectors in China’s fast-growing and sprawling food industry. China is Yum’s biggest market and McDonald’s third largest by outlets. Behind the thousands of brightly-lit restaurants offering what Chinese consumers see as better quality food lie supply chains that rely on an army of poorly regulated and inadequately audited processing plants. Yum has around 650 suppliers in China alone. China’s government has struggled to restore confidence in its $1 trillion food processing industry since six infants died in 2008 after drinking adulterated milk. The head of China’s Food and Drug Administration told the China Daily this week that the food safety situation “remains severe” and the existing oversight system “is not effective.” China’s food testing industry is expected to top 8 billion yuan ($1.29 billion) by next year, with more than 5,000 companies offering food inspection services. Regulators overseeing the industry are thinly stretched, company executives say. Laws on food safety are incomplete and responsibility in enforcing them is unclear, making it difficult for regulators to do their jobs, Gao Guan, deputy secretary-general of the China Meat Association, told Reuters. “In developed countries people obey the traffic rules. You wait when the light is red and you walk when the light is green. But this is not the case in China. People walk when other people walk and no one cares about the light. So in this particular environment things like Husi are very hard to avoid,” Gao said. OSI, ranked by Forbes at 62nd on its list of U.S. private companies with annual revenue of close to $6 billion, said this week it suspended operations at Shanghai Husi Food and would review all its China plants, which would now come under direct control of its headquarters in Illinois. [ID:nL4N0Q31OC] It said it would “assign a vigilant rotation of global experts to continuously survey these operations and implement exhaustive audit steps,” including constant visual surveillance of production measures and document compliance. The Shanghai Husi scandal exposes weaknesses in big foreign brands’ ability to police their own supply chains and processing plants - whether in-house or through third-party auditors. “The issue with quality control audits is that the factories usually know about it and get ready,” said Max Henry, Shanghai-based executive director of the Global Supply Chain Council. Driven by extreme price pressures and an ambivalent workforce, suppliers often try to hide dubious practices from inspectors, showing them only certain parts of a factory or taking them to “fake” plants, so reports rarely give a full picture of compliance, auditors told Reuters.  “They want to give the customer the best picture of the factory, so when something’s going wrong, they have to hide it,” said Evelyne Mazaleyrat, product manager, food service for food auditor Bureau Veritas in Asia. Audits of the Shanghai Husi factory by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in 2004 and 2010 to clear the way for potential Chinese poultry exports to the United States, gave the facility a clean bill of health. However, links to USDA audit forms show a one-page “checklist” format that some food safety experts have criticized. To be sure, gaps in the auditing process are not limited to China. “It’s a bankrupt system,” said Mansour Samadpour, microbiologist and CEO of IEH Laboratories & Consulting Group in Seattle, noting audits are normally scheduled ahead of time and organised around publicly available questionnaires. “It’s become a way for people to abdicate their responsibilities for the safety of the food product they are selling.” Buyers such as Yum and McDonald’s operate on huge volumes and demand very low prices from their suppliers, which compete fiercely for business on razor-thin margins. Shanghai Husi is just the tip of the problem.  Last year, Yum shareholders filed four lawsuits against the company for failing to properly oversee its Chinese poultry suppliers and misleading investors about growth in China, according to U.S. court records. Yum says it audits each of its suppliers at least once a year. “The Western firms have put in place regimes that clearly have holes in them, with KFC perhaps having the biggest problem because they have the most suppliers,” said Richard Brubaker, an adjunct professor at the China Europe International Business School and founder of the Collective Responsibility consultancy. A sample audit report from Silliker, which lists McDonald’s as a client in some of its markets, covers basic information such as a facility’s location and workforce, and asks, too, about cleaning, sterilization schedules and storage temperatures.  Pony Testing International, which lists McDonald’s and KFC as clients, says it carries out physical and chemical tests including for nutritional make-up, additives, non-food substances, microbial indicators and pesticide residues.

Shanghai Husi is just the tip of the problem. Last year, Yum shareholders filed four lawsuits against the company for failing to properly oversee its Chinese poultry suppliers and misleading investors about growth in China, according to U.S. court records. Yum says it audits each of its suppliers at least once a year. “The Western firms have put in place regimes that clearly have holes in them, with KFC perhaps having the biggest problem because they have the most suppliers,” said Richard Brubaker, an adjunct professor at the China Europe International Business School and founder of the Collective Responsibility consultancy. A sample audit report from Silliker, which lists McDonald’s as a client in some of its markets, covers basic information such as a facility’s location and workforce, and asks, too, about cleaning, sterilization schedules and storage temperatures. Pony Testing International, which lists McDonald’s and KFC as clients, says it carries out physical and chemical tests including for nutritional make-up, additives, non-food substances, microbial indicators and pesticide residues.

514,MCD,"McDonald's, not only franchisees, liable in worker complaints: NLRB","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp, not just its franchisees, can be held liable in complaints that the company violated employee rights, an official at the U.S. National Labor Relations Board said in a letter made public on Tuesday. NLRB general counsel Richard Griffin Jr. wrote in the letter that of the 181 complaints filed against the fast-food chain  since November 2012 in connection with employee protests, 43 had merit. McDonald’s will be named as a joint respondent in those cases if they are not settled, Griffin wrote. Christine Owens, the executive director of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers, said the McDonald’s must be held accountable for its franchisees. The NLRB decision means corporations “cannot feign ignorance or disclaim responsibility for franchisees’ illegal acts, especially when those acts flow from the business model the lead company imposes,” she said In a statement, McDonald’s senior vice president of human resources, Heather Smedstad, said the NLRB decision was wrong and the company would contest it. McDonald’s relationship with its franchisees does not establish a joint employer relationship, Smedstad said. The NLRB decision “changes the rules for thousands of small businesses, and goes against decades of established law regarding the franchise model in the United States,” Smedstad said. McDonald’s, the world’s biggest restaurant operator by revenue, has been at the center a national debate on pay inequality at a time when many middle- to low-income Americans are struggling to make ends meet. According to the NLRB letter, 68 complaints against McDonald’s had no merit, and 64 are still under investigation.

Yum said on Wednesday that the scare, triggered by a TV report earlier this month showing improper meat handling by a supplier, Shanghai Husi Food, caused “significant, negative” damage to sales at KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants over the past 10 days. “If the significant sales impact is sustained, it will have a material effect on full-year earnings per share,” Yum said in a regulatory filing.  Shares in Yum, which counts China as its No. 1 market, tumbled nearly 7 percent on Thursday.  At least three brokerages cut their profit estimates for Yum for 2014 and 2015. RBC analysts said Yum’s China sales could be hurt 10-15 percent for 6-8 weeks, and cut their price target to $85 from $94.  UBS analysts said the initial consumer response was worse than feared, and the company should reinstate reporting monthly figures to reduce uncertainty.    Officials from McDonald’s in China and Hong Kong have not responded to requests for information on the impact on sales from the scandal, but McDonald’s Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd on Tuesday scrapped its full-year earnings guidance after the China scare forced it to switch to alternative chicken supplies.  A McDonald’s Japan executive said sales had dropped 15-20 percent on a daily basis due to the scare. Both McDonald’s and Yum are looking to China - where consumers see foreign brands as offering better food quality - for long-term growth given the size of its population, growing middle class and rapid economic growth.    “Both of these stocks are banking heavily on China for their future growth,” said Richard Brubaker, an adjunct professor at the China Europe International Business School and founder of the Collective Responsibility consultancy.  “For Yum, this is a problem because it has a history of problems in China. For McDonald’s, it’s the sheer size of the problem and the inability to get product.” CONSUMER CAUTION    Yum, which has nearly 6,400 restaurants in China, had just begun to see its restaurant sales there recovering from a slide last year due to an avian food outbreak and a previous food safety scare. Yum has cut its global ties with OSI Group LLC [OSIGP.UL], the U.S. parent of Shanghai Husi Food. Yum said OSI was not a major supplier and the move had “minimal disruption” to the availability of menu offerings in China.    McDonald’s, which has more than 2,000 restaurants in China, has had a long relationship with OSI and was more dependent on the supplier than Yum. Many McDonald’s China outlets have been hit by meat shortages since the company ended its relationship with OSI there.     Around two-thirds of the more than five dozen consumers Reuters reporters spoke to in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong on Thursday said they would scale back their visits to McDonald’s, at least for now.    “For people like us, McDonald’s and KFC are places to meet friends,” said Yao Nanfang, a 16-year-old student in a shopping mall in central Shanghai. “We’ll still go to McDonald’s, but we’ll order fewer meat products.”    Diners in Hong Kong also said they were likely to eat less frequently at McDonald’s, but noted that the chain’s low prices made it hard to give up.     “I come to McDonald’s less often now, but I won’t completely stop coming because it’s so much cheaper than other restaurants,” said Nan Tang, who says he eats at McDonald’s twice a week.

518,MCD,COLUMN-Clashes with Russia point to globalization's end,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Mark Leonard July 31 (Reuters) - As the European Union and the United States ramp up their sanctions on Russia, President Vladimir Putin’s plans for retaliation seem to include an attack on McDonald’s. There could not be a more powerful symbol that geopolitics is increasingly undoing the globalization of the world economy. The burger chain was celebrated in the 1990s by the journalist Thomas Friedman’s “Golden Arches theory of conflict prevention,” which argued that the spread of McDonald’s around the world would bring an end to war. But almost 25 years after a McDonald’s restaurant opened in Moscow, it seems that deep interdependence has not ended conflict between great powers - it has merely provided a new battlefield for it. As in any relationship that turns sour, many of the things that initially tie the parties together are now being used to drive them apart. For the past two decades we have heard that the world is becoming a global village because of the breadth and depth of its trading and investment links, its nascent global governance and the networks of the information age. But those forces for interdependence are degenerating into their opposite; we could call it the three faces of ‘splinterdependence’: From free trade to economic warfare: Economic interdependence was supposed to defuse geopolitical tensions over time - or at least allow the two to be compartmentalized. But today the West is using Russia’s participation in the global economy to punish it for its actions in eastern Ukraine. The EU has announced sanctions that will hit Russia in the banking, oil and defense industries. When China felt its interests were threatened, it was also willing to use economic sanctions in its territorial disputes with the Philippines and Japan. In May, Beijing found itself on the receiving end as Vietnam turned a blind eye to anti-Chinese riots targeting Chinese plants when China put an oil rig in the disputed Paracel Islands. From global governance to competitive multilateralism: Many saw global trade relations as a prelude to global government, with rising powers such as Russia and China being socialized into roles as “responsible stakeholders” in a single global system. But multilateral integration now seems to be dividing rather than uniting. Geopolitical competition gridlocks global institutions; the Ukraine crisis came about because of a clash between two incompatible projects of multilateral integration - the European-led Eastern Partnership and Russia’s Eurasian Union. There is a global trend of competing mini-lateral friendship organizations. On the one hand, the “world without the West” encompasses the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and a host of sub-regional bodies. On the other, the West is creating new groupings outside the universal institutions - such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership in Asia and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - that deliberately exclude China and Russia. Rather than seeing international law as a way of de-escalating disputes between countries, people are increasingly talking about its use as a weapon against hostile countries - “lawfare.” From one Internet to many: Even the Internet is leading to hostile fragmentation rather than a global public square. Putin might have offered Edward Snowden refuge, but it is America’s closest allies - such as Angela Merkel in Germany and President Dilma Rousseff in Brazil - who are the most concerned about the National Security Agency’s prying into their citizens private lives. Anupam Chander and Uyen P. Le of the University of California at Davis contend that “Anxieties over surveillance  are justifying governmental measures that break apart the World Wide Web  the era of a global Internet may be passing.” They claim that countries such as Australia, France, South Korea, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Vietnam have already moved to keep certain types of data on servers within their national borders. After the end of the Cold War, when the apostles of globalization argued that trade would soon eclipse warfare, the military strategist Edward Luttwak predicted that they would soon be proved wrong. Although capital would replace firepower as a weapon of choice, and market penetration would play the role that bases and garrisons had in earlier generations, the driving force of international relations would be conflict rather than trade. As he put it, we would have “the grammar of commerce but the logic of war.” Luttwak’s prediction seemed misplaced at a time when countries such as Russia, China, India and Brazil were rushing to join the global economy. The post-Cold War world these countries entered was marked by the development of an U.S.-led unipolar security order and a European-led legal order that sought to bind the world together through free trade, economic interdependence, international law and multilateral institutions. Today, we can see that the U.S.-led security order is fraying both as a result of war-weariness and the emergence of new powers internationally. As a result, great powers such as the United States are increasingly trying to weaponize the international legal order through sanctions to compensate for their unwillingness to use military force. Interdependence, formerly an economic boon, has now become a threat as well. No one is willing to lose out on the benefits of a global economy, but all great powers are thinking about how to protect themselves from its risks, military and otherwise. China is moving toward domestic consumption after the threat of the U.S. financial crisis. America is moving toward energy independence after the Iraq War. Russia is trying to build a Eurasian Union after the euro crisis. And even internationalist Germany is trying to change the EU so that its fellow member states are bound into German-style policies. In the years after the Cold War, interdependence was a force for ending conflict.  But in 2014, it is creating it. After 25 years of being bound together ever more tightly, the world seems intent on resegregating itself.

519,MCD,McDonald's CEO Thompson 'under siege' at home and abroad,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp CEO Don Thompson sure could use a break. The head of the world’s biggest restaurant chain, who for much of his two years at the helm has been battling to spark  sales growth in the United States and Europe, got battered by headline-grabbing bad news in late July. In the final days of the month, its China business was hit with a food-safety scare involving a key supplier; the chain got ensnared in the West’s sanctions standoff with Russia; burger flippers at U.S. restaurants claimed an incremental win from the National Labor Relations Board in their fight to hold McDonald’s responsible for the actions of franchisees; and, a Texas jury slapped the company with a $27 million verdict. Add to all that its results showed second-quarter profit dropped more than expected. “They’re under siege on three continents,” said Howard Penney, restaurant analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management, an investment research firm. To be sure, the company’s famous name and the ubiquity of its restaurants worldwide help to fuel the media storm, said Penney: “McDonald’s is a pawn in many instances around the world. It’s an easy target.”  Such upheavals are not uncommon for McDonald’s and other global power houses, including Coca-Cola Co and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, experts said, though perhaps not quite so many in such a short period.  In a statement a McDonald’s spokeswoman said: “In the last few weeks, we’ve seen issues in various parts of the world which directly or indirectly affect our brand and others. We have 35,000 McDonald’s restaurants in 120 countries, and skilled professional communications teams in every area of the world.” She said that dealing with a 24/7 news cycle around the world is par for the course, and the communications teams address such issues so that the company can keep its focus on serving customers. Thompson was not made available for comment. Analysts and investors said the latest, largely external events appear to pose manageable risk to McDonald’s profits, but they are a headache at a time when the company is grappling with intense competition, shifting consumer tastes and service slow-downs stemming from the menu additions of everything from salads and wraps to lattes and smoothies aimed at broadening its audience and boosting sales. Branding expert Robert Passikoff, said McDonald’s needs to find a way to stand out from the crowd. “McDonald’s has reached the point where it’s become a default brand. It’s there. That’s it,” said Passikoff, president of Brand Keys. Shares in McDonald’s are up less than 7 percent since Thompson took the helm on July 1, 2012, lagging the S&P; 500’s gain of nearly 42 percent in that period.     Investors, analysts and franchisees are clamoring for the company to stop trying to be “all things to all people”. They want it to simplify its unwieldy menu and point to the success of rivals like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and In-N-Out Burger, which have won passionate fans by selling just a few items. McDonald’s was caught up in the latest China food safety scare after a July 20 television expose showed workers allegedly mishandling meat at Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, a factory owned by OSI Group LLC, a major supplier to the chain.  When the story broke, McDonald’s China business had been rebounding from the double whammy of a food safety scare and a bird flu outbreak that crushed sales in 2013.  McDonald’s roughly 2,000 restaurants in China suffered meat shortages after it ended its relationship with OSI China.    Executives from the chain’s long-struggling Japanese unit, McDonald’s Holdings Co Ltd, who were forced to find alternate chicken McNugget supplies, said the scare sent sales down as much as 20 percent. Seattle-based portfolio manager Bill Smead, whose firm Smead Capital Management holds nearly 516,000 shares in McDonald’s, took news of the China food scandal in stride. “We assume that something is going to go amazingly haywire with companies in China,” said Smead, who added that he has ceased adding to McDonald’s holdings while the company works through its “tribulation” period.   About 15 percent of McDonald’s operating profit comes from the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit that includes China and Japan, said Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore. The bigger concern, she said, are McDonald’s troubles in Russia, where the company has about 400 restaurants.  Against the backdrop of the political tussle over U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia because of Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine, Russia’s chief sanitary inspector Anna Popova on July 25 accused the company of violations “which put the product quality and safety of the entire McDonald’s chain in doubt.” Europe contributes about 35 percent of McDonald’s operating profit. The company does not break out country-specific contributions, but Russia “up until recently had been one of the stronger markets for them in Europe,” Senatore said. Meanwhile at home, the troubles also piled on.  McDonald’s workers’ union-backed fight for better wages and working conditions scored points when the general counsel for the U.S. National Labor Relations Board said in a letter made public on July 29 that McDonald’s, not just its franchisees, can be held liable in complaints that the company violated employee rights. David Hess, associate professor of business law at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, said the NLRB attorney’s finding is just an early step in what is usually a long process. As for the $27 million jury verdict awarded to family members of two teenagers who died following a beating in a McDonald’s restaurant in Texas, legal experts said that is expected to fail on appeal. McDonald’s executives have promised to boost sales over the next 12 to 18 months by doing things like focusing on value, digital advertising and the quality of its food.  As for Thompson, Penney predicted that he will survive the current crises and gets more time to fix the longer-term problems, at least into 2015. “I don’t think he’s going anywhere. It’s too soon,” he said.       ",8032014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-woes-analysis/mcdonalds-ceo-thompson-under-siege-at-home-and-abroad-idUSKBN0G30M020140803
520,MCD,China police detain six in tainted meat scandal: Xinhua,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Police in China have detained six executives of a meat supply company at the center of the latest food safety scare to hit the country, state media reported on Sunday. Shanghai’s chief of police and deputy mayor Bai Shaokang told local radio that the executives of Shanghai Husi Food, a unit of U.S.-based OSI Group LLC, had been taken into custody,  Xinhua news agency said. The firm had supplied meat to foreign fast food chains McDonald’s and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc, among many others. The scandal, which also dragged in coffee chain Starbucks Corp.O>, was triggered by a local television report showing staff at Shanghai Husi using long-expired meat. The report also alleged the firm forged production dates. Food safety has been a huge concern for Chinese consumers after dairy products tainted with the industrial chemical melamine sickened many thousands and led to the deaths of six infants in 2008. Regulators closed the Shanghai Husi plant on July 20. Police have detained five people, including Shanghai Husi’s head and quality manager. It was not clear from the Xinhua report if Bai was referring to the same executives. “If any wrongdoing was unearthed, we would deal with it strictly according to law,” Bai was quoted as saying. Yum Brands Inc is the biggest Western restaurant operator in China with 6,400 restaurants. It warned last week that the scare caused “significant, negative” damage to sales at KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants in the period from July 20 through July 30. After the scandal broke, Yum quickly cut all ties with OSI,    which was not a significant supplier to the chain. McDonald’s Corp, which has deep ties to OSI and was more dependent on the supplier, ended its relationship with OSI China. As a result, many of its 2,000 restaurants in the country have suffered meat shortages. McDonald’s Holdings Co Ltd, the Japanese unit of the world’s biggest restaurant chain, withdrew its earnings guidance for the year after the scandal forced it to switch to alternative chicken supplies.

521,MCD,McDonald's says China food scandal hurting regional results,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp said its business has been hurt by China’s latest food scare that forced restaurants in the region to temporarily pull meat items from menus. An undercover local Chinese TV report on July 20 showed  workers at Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd using expired meat and doctoring food production dates. Regulators immediately closed the factory, which is part of OSI Group LLC, a U.S. food supplier and important McDonald’s partner. “While this matter will negatively impact results in the near term, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact on full year 2014 earnings at this time,” according to a regulatory filing from McDonald’s, which has just over 2,000 restaurants in China. McDonald’s warning on Monday came just days after rival Yum Brands Inc, which has about 6,400 restaurants in China and whose KFC is the biggest Western brand in the country, also said the scandal was driving China customers away.  McDonald’s shares dropped 0.5 percent to $93.86 at mid-afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.     Shares of McDonald’s and Yum have fallen 5.2 percent and 8.6 percent, respectively, since the scandal broke on July 20.         McDonald’s Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd on July 29 withdrew its full-year earnings forecast after the China meat scare caused sales to drop 15 to 20 percent on a daily basis.  The company, which has more than 3,100 restaurants in Japan, previously had forecast an operating profit of 11.7 billion yen ($115 million) for 2014. McDonald’s affected markets account for about 10 percent of its total revenue, the world’s largest burger chain said in its filing on Monday.    About 15 percent of operating profit at McDonald’s comes from its Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit that includes China and Japan, analysts said.     The warning from McDonald’s prompted Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski to cut his earnings per share estimates for the fast-food chain by 3 cents to $1.55 for the third quarter, and by 1 cent to $1.43 for the fourth quarter.         Yum on July 30 warned that the scandal had hurt sales badly at its KFC and Pizza Hut restaurants over the previous 10 days.          Yum got 35 percent of its operating profit from China last year and is more exposed to the market than McDonald’s.      Yum did not quantify the impact of the China scandal on its profits, but said that a sustained, significant sales impact would “have a material effect on full-year earnings per share.”     The double whammy of a food safety scare and bird flu in China battered sales at McDonald’s and Yum last year. Those sales had just stared to recover when the latest food scandal emerged.

The company said that while the scandal would hurt results in the near term, it could not currently estimate the impact on earnings for the full year.

527,MCD,Russian import ban to have limited effect on Western food firms,"* Multinational firms have local production, suppliers * Targeted nations export 10 pct of banned goods-analyst * German meat exports seen hardest hit By Maria Kiselyova and Martinne Geller MOSCOW/LONDON, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Western multinationals like Nestle, Unilever and McDonalds will feel only a limited effect from Russia’s ban on certain food imports from Europe and the United States, since they largely produce domestically. In retaliation for sanctions related to the crisis in Ukraine, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday Russia would ban fruit, vegetable, meat, fish, milk and dairy imports from the United States, the European Union, Australia, Canada and Norway for one year starting immediately. While the impact on international food producers may be muted, Russian shoppers are expected to see the effect of the measures in higher prices. Makers of packaged goods said they were still assessing the potential damage, but many companies including PepsiCo  and Danone have invested heavily in Russia, building local plants, and already source most products locally. Nestle, for example, has invested $1.6 billion in Russia since 1996 and has 11 plants in the country producing a wide range of products from ice cream to pet food. “More than 90 percent of the company’s products sold on the Russian market are produced locally, but there are specific raw materials that we import,” a Nestle spokeswoman said, adding that it would take some time to estimate the potential impact if the ban forced changes in suppliers. “The most unpleasant thing is the need to change suppliers on the go, off cycle, which would entail additional costs,” said a spokeswoman for Anglo-Dutch group Unilever, a major ice cream and ketchup producer in Russia. A market source said companies would likely pay fines for early termination of contracts with suppliers of banned foodstuffs. Danone said Russian and Belarussian milk meets 100 percent of its needs for the Russian markets but declined to comment on possible implications of the milk and dairy import ban on the broader market and prices. Meanwhile Finnish dairy cooperative Valio Ltd has halted production of goods it exports from Finland to Russia, according to Finnish media. Nobody at the company was immediately available to comment. According to research firm Euromonitor International, the country most affected by the ban would be Germany, followed by the United States, Ukraine and Canada. The amount of German meat and meat products exported to Russia in 2012 were worth about $900 million at wholesale, Euromonitor said. Of the categories banned - fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and dairy - Russian imports from the targeted countries account for less than 10 percent of production, as measured by wholesale prices, said Euromonitor food analyst Lianne van den Bos. “The restrictions were imposed on products that Russia can produce itself or is less dependent on banned countries,” van den Bos said, adding that in these categories, Russia imports a lot from Latin America and Asia. “Having said that, these sanctions put pressure on local producers as well as other trade partners as Russia has to look elsewhere for substitution, which in turn is likely to push up prices for Russian consumers if government does not step in,” she added. Russia’s domestic food industry has grown significantly in recent years, boosted by earlier bans on U.S. meat imports over safety concerns and investment by foreign companies. “We’re committed to developing local suppliers,” said a spokesman for Mondelez International. “In fact, over the last five years, we’ve doubled the share of procurement from local suppliers.” The maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies generated $1.2 billion in revenue from Russia last year. At present McDonald’s, the world’s largest hamburger chain, sources 85 percent of its ingredients from more than 160 domestic suppliers. “We are continually looking at ways to extend cooperation with the Russian manufacturers,” a spokeswoman said. “We are monitoring the situation and will adjust our plans accordingly.” Pepsico, which is Russia’s biggest buyer of potatoes and became the biggest food and beverage producer in the country when it bought juice and dairy maker Wimm-Bill-Dann in 2011, said that almost all of the products sold in Russia are made in Russia. “We are reviewing the new policy,” a spokeswoman said. Even for meat companies like Tyson Foods and Hormel Foods, Russia has declined in importance, due to the earlier bans and efforts to boost its domestic food industry. “We’re disappointed about the loss of the Russian market, but don’t expect the impact to be significant since the volume we ship there can be absorbed by other global markets,” said a Tyson spokesman. “If the ban came 10 years ago it would have been a big deal but at this point Russia is less important overall,” said Liang Feng, a Chicago-based analyst for research firm Morningstar.

528,MCD,McDonald's casts doubt on sales outlook after China food scare,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) said on Friday that its global sales forecast for 2014 was at risk after a China food scandal drove away diners and forced the chain to scramble to find new suppliers of ingredients for Chicken McNuggets and Big Macs. The warning could portend the company’s first full year of global sales declines at established restaurants since 2002, Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a client note.  McDonald’s global same-restaurant sales dropped a steeper-than-expected 2.5 percent in July, which Kalinowski said was the company’s worst monthly performance in a decade.      The trouble in China hit as the world’s biggest hamburger chain was already scrambling to bolster its U.S. business, where monthly sales at established restaurants have been down or flat since November.  But investors were braced for bad news, and McDonald’s shares were down just 0.1 percent at $93.19 in morning trading.  McDonald’s on Monday warned that sales in markets including China and Japan were experiencing a “significant negative impact” following a local Chinese TV report on July 20 that showed workers at a supplier using expired meat and doctoring food production dates.  “As a result of the China supplier issue, the company’s global comparable sales forecast for 2014 is now at risk,” McDonald’s said in a statement on Friday. Last month, executives said they expected full-year worldwide sales at restaurants open at least 13 months to be “relatively flat” due to increased competition, pricing and other cost pressures. McDonald’s said same-restaurant sales in Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA), which includes China and Japan, fell 7.3 percent in July. McDonald’s had 35,683 restaurants in 119 countries around the world on June 30. Roughly 2,000 of those were in China, and about another 3,100 were in Japan.  The company did not quantify the magnitude of the sales impact in China, where sales had just recovered from the double whammy of a separate food safety scandal and bird flu outbreak that crushed business there last year.  McDonald’s Holdings Co Ltd (2702.T), the long-struggling Japan unit, on July 29 withdrew its full-year earnings forecast after the China meat scare caused sales to drop 15 percent to 20 percent on a daily basis. U.S. same-restaurant sales fell 3.2 percent in July, more than the 2.6 percent decline expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. McDonald’s has been losing ground in its home market, hurt by tough competition from Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N, sluggish job and wage growth, and consumer’s diminishing appetite for processed food.

531,MCD,"UPDATE 1-McDonald's, Yum release supplier data after China food safety scare","(Adds supplier details, analyst comment) SHANGHAI, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Five fast food chains including McDonald’s and Yum Brands Inc have published details of their suppliers on their Chinese websites following a request from Shanghai authorities after a food safety scare. Shanghai’s Municipal Food and Drug Administration said on Saturday it had asked the two chains, along with Burger King , Dicos and Carl’s Jr, to publish the usually confidential information as part of efforts government efforts to strengthen oversight of food suppliers. The five firms were among a range of companies that used meat from Shanghai Husi Food, a unit of U.S.-based OSI Group LLC, which was alleged by a TV report to have improperly handled meat and used expired food. The Shanghai authority said the companies published the information on Aug. 9. Yum’s suppliers include subsidiaries of WH Group’s  and China Yurun Food while McDonald’s milk suppliers include Beijing Sanyuan Foods Co Ltd and Kowloon Dairy. A Shandong meat unit in which China’s state-backed COFCO Corp owns shares supplies both Yum and Burger King, the lists showed. Benjamin Cavender, Shanghai-based analyst at China Market Research Group, said food chains are generally reluctant to publish supplier lists as they don’t want competitors to know where they source their materials. “In this case it’s probably smart for the companies to do this because they want to send a clear message that they are being transparent both to the government and to their consumers,” he said. “But in reality for the situation to truly get better there’s going to have to be stricter oversight directly over the suppliers and that cannot just be coming from the brands, it also has to come as well from the government.” The food scare involving Shanghai Husi Food is testing local consumers’ loyalty to foreign fast-food brands.

534,MCD,Tim Hortons to battle Starbucks; price rises likely,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons, which has offered only one coffee blend in its 50-year history, hopes to lure new coffee drinkers and fend off rivals such as Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) with the launch throughout North America of its new dark roast blend. Tim Hortons, which announced the move on Thursday, may also increase prices to tackle rising costs and competition from U.S. rivals expanding in Canada. “Looking at the coffee market, I would suggest that, given the degree of cost increases, that we are looking at prices going up sometime in 2015,” Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO chief executive Marc Caira said on Thursday. Tim Hortons, which says it serves nearly 8 out of every 10 cups of coffee sold in Canada, outlined a plan in February to kick-start growth and improve returns by fine-tuning its menu to encourage more spending, improving service and opening new restaurant formats. Last week, the chain reported market-beating quarterly growth that showed its strategy, which includes higher priced and new menu items, is paying off. Still, traffic declined for the ninth consecutive quarter in Canada and is flat in the United States.  Caira expects the new dark brew, which will also be available for home brewing in formats such as Keurig Mountain Inc’s single serve pod, to contribute to results, but he declined to give details. The alternative brew was first sold late last fall in Columbus, Ohio and London, Ontario, and then in the province of Quebec in June. It will be offered at all 4,496 restaurants across Canada and the United States starting Friday. “There’s about 38 to 40 percent of coffee drinkers that are looking for a darker roast,” said Caira. “Those are very intriguing numbers for us ... If we weren’t pleased with the (initial) numbers, we wouldn’t be launching it.” Caira, a former top Nestle SA executive who took over at the Canadian chain a little more than a year ago, plans to tackle inflationary pressure from higher coffee bean prices and labor costs by cutting waste and improving efficiencies. “The last thing that we want to do is arbitrarily increase prices,” said Caira, but he conceded the chain will likely raise prices in 2015. He could not say what products might be affected. Caira said the company was also working with Ottawa to address labor shortages in some parts of Canada following tighter rules on hiring temporary foreign workers in the restaurant industry.  “There must be flexibility in the system to address labor issues in certain parts of the country,” Caira said. He added that in some markets there are not enough people to work in the company’s restaurants. “That is a fact proven out by number,” he said. “In those cases, there’s a need for this program.” ",8142014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tim-hortons-ceo/tim-hortons-to-battle-starbucks-price-rises-likely-idUSKBN0GE2FN20140814

537,MCD,Russia shuts four McDonald's restaurants amid Ukraine tensions,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia ordered the temporary closure of four McDonald’s restaurants in Moscow on Wednesday, a decision it said was over sanitary violations but which comes against a backdrop of worsening U.S.-Russian ties over Ukraine. The four restaurants ordered to suspend operations by the state food safety watchdog included the first ever McDonald’s in Russia, which opened in the last days of the Soviet Union, and which the company says is its most frequented in the world. On Wednesday evening, the lights were off inside the restaurant - usually crammed with diners - and a sign on the door said it was shut “for technical reasons”. McDonald’s Corp shares were down 0.3 percent at 3:11 p.m. EDT, against the backdrop of a slightly firmer U.S. stock market. The watchdog, known in Russia as Rospotrebnadzor, said in a statement inspectors had found numerous sanitary violations. A source at the watchdog said it had sealed off parts of the restaurants’ premises.  Asked if the decision was a retaliation for the United States and other countries imposing economic sanctions on Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine, the source declined to comment and referred to the statement about sanitary violations. McDonald’s head office in Illinois said in a statement: “We are closely studying the subject of the documents to define what should be done to re-open the restaurants as soon as possible.” Russia’s first McDonald’s opened on Moscow’s Pushkin Square in 1990, when it was viewed as a sign that, under reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Cold War tensions with the United States were starting to thaw. It was hugely popular with Russians; long queues formed outside and some people even had their wedding receptions there.  “We have many happy memories of this place,” said a man who gave his name as Vadim. He had come with his wife Natalya to celebrate his 77th birthday at McDonald’s, but was forced instead to buy a coffee elsewhere and drink it seated at a coffee table outside the shuttered restaurant.  Asked about the allegations of sanitary violations, he said: “It’s a lie. We’ve been here since it first opened and never got ill once.”  Another of the restaurants closed on the orders of the food safety watchdog is on Moscow’s Manezh Square, under the walls of the Kremlin where President Vladimir Putin has his offices. McDonald’s, seen as a symbol of the U.S. global expansion, has been criticized by Russian nationalists. Prominent politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky called for the chain to be shut down across Russia after the company withdrew from Crimea peninsula in April following Moscow’s annexation of the region from Ukraine. Some consumers share that view. “I am for McDonald’s being wiped from the face of the earth,” said Vladimir Zolotsev, 20, studying to be a pianist, who was near the Pushkin Square restaurant. It became clear last month that McDonald’s was under heightened scrutiny from the Russian state, when the watchdog said it had identified violations in product quality that raised questions about the safety of food across the chain. Foreign food producers who have fallen foul of the watchdog in the past have accused it of acting in the political interests of the Kremlin, an allegation it denies. The watchdog banned Georgian wine as Tbilisi strengthened ties with Washington and spirits from Moldova after the former Soviet republic boosted its drive to partner with the European Union. Janusz Piechocinski, the deputy prime minister of Poland, said last month that a decision by the watchdog to ban most Polish fruit and vegetable imports was an act of “political repression” by the Kremlin. McDonald’s operates 438 restaurants in Russia and sees the country as one of its top seven major markets outside the United States and Canada, according to its 2013 annual report. “Russia has been a very bright spot for McDonald’s,” said Mark Kalinowski, a restaurant analyst for Janney Capital Markets.  Russia accounts for roughly 10 percent of McDonald’s operating profit from Europe, which contributes about one-third of fast-food chain’s overall operating profit, Kalinowski said. Earlier this month Russia banned all meat, fish, dairy, fruit and vegetable imports from the United States, the European Union, Norway, Canada, and Australia for one year in retaliation for the sanctions imposed by these countries over Ukraine. However, some of these restrictions were eased on Wednesday to allow the import of some items that are useful to Russia’s own food and agriculture industries, such as vegetables for planting and hatchlings of salmon and trout.

The four restaurants ordered to suspend operations by the state food safety watchdog included the first ever McDonald’s in Russia, which opened in the last days of the Soviet Union, and which the company says is its most frequented in the world. On Wednesday evening, the lights were off inside the restaurant - usually crammed with diners - and a sign on the door said it was shut “for technical reasons”. McDonald’s Corp shares were down 0.3 percent at 1911 GMT (3:11 p.m. EDT), against the backdrop of a slightly firmer U.S. stock market. The watchdog, known in Russia as Rospotrebnadzor, said in a statement inspectors had found numerous sanitary violations. A source at the watchdog said it had sealed off parts of the restaurants’ premises. Asked if the decision was a retaliation for the United States and other countries imposing economic sanctions on Moscow over the crisis in Ukraine, the source declined to comment and referred to the statement about sanitary violations. McDonald’s head office in Illinois said in a statement: “We are closely studying the subject of the documents to define what should be done to re-open the restaurants as soon as possible.” Russia’s first McDonald’s opened on Moscow’s Pushkin Square in 1990, when it was viewed as a sign that, under reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Cold War tensions with the United States were starting to thaw. It was hugely popular with Russians; long queues formed outside and some people even had their wedding receptions there. “We have many happy memories of this place,” said a man who gave his name as Vadim. He had come with his wife Natalya to celebrate his 77th birthday at McDonald’s, but was forced instead to buy a coffee elsewhere and drink it seated at a coffee table outside the shuttered restaurant. Asked about the allegations of sanitary violations, he said: “It’s a lie. We’ve been here since it first opened and never got ill once.” Another of the restaurants closed on the orders of the food safety watchdog is on Moscow’s Manezh Square, under the walls of the Kremlin where President Vladimir Putin has his offices. McDonald’s, seen as a symbol of the U.S. global expansion, has been criticised by Russian nationalists. Prominent politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky called for the chain to be shut down across Russia after the company withdrew from Crimea peninsula in April following Moscow’s annexation of the region from Ukraine. Some consumers share that view. “I am for McDonald’s being wiped from the face of the earth,” said Vladimir Zolotsev, 20, studying to be a pianist, who was near the Pushkin Square restaurant. It became clear last month that McDonald’s was under heightened scrutiny from the Russian state, when the watchdog said it had identified violations in product quality that raised questions about the safety of food across the chain. Foreign food producers who have fallen foul of the watchdog in the past have accused it of acting in the political interests of the Kremlin, an allegation it denies. The watchdog banned Georgian wine as Tbilisi strengthened ties with Washington and spirits from Moldova after the former Soviet republic boosted its drive to partner with the European Union. Janusz Piechocinski, the deputy prime minister of Poland, said last month that a decision by the watchdog to ban most Polish fruit and vegetable imports was an act of “political repression” by the Kremlin. McDonald’s operates 438 restaurants in Russia and sees the country as one of its top seven major markets outside the United States and Canada, according to its 2013 annual report. “Russia has been a very bright spot for McDonald’s,” said Mark Kalinowski, a restaurant analyst for Janney Capital Markets. Russia accounts for roughly 10 percent of McDonald’s operating profit from Europe, which contributes about one-third of fast-food chain’s overall operating profit, Kalinowski said. Earlier this month Russia banned all meat, fish, dairy, fruit and vegetable imports from the United States, the European Union, Norway, Canada, and Australia for one year in retaliation for the sanctions imposed by these countries over Ukraine. However, some of these restrictions were eased on Wednesday to allow the import of some items that are useful to Russia’s own food and agriculture industries, such as vegetables for planting and hatchlings of salmon and trout.

541,MCD,"After Russia targets McDonald's, businesses wonder who's next","MOSCOW Russia (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday it was investigating dozens of McDonald’s (MCD.N) restaurants, in what many businessmen said was retaliation for Western sanctions over Ukraine they fear could spread to other symbols of Western capitalism. Russia’s food safety watchdog said it was looking at possible breaches of sanitary rules at McDonald’s, but many in the business community said it was a reflection of the deterioration in relations between Russia and the West over Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country are fighting against government forces. “Obviously, it’s driven by the political issues surrounding Ukraine,” said Alexis Rodzianko, President and CEO of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia. “The question on my mind is: Is this going to be a knock on the door, or is this going to be the beginning of a campaign?” Russia earlier this month slapped bans on Western food imports after Washington and Brussels imposed economic sanctions in response to Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region and its backing of the separatists. In a sign of growing frustration at the threat to trade, several mid-tier Russian businessmen signed off on a letter by British entrepreneur Richard Branson calling on politicians to stop the conflict. “We, as business leaders from Russia, Ukraine and the rest of the world, urge our governments to work together to ensure we do not regress into the Cold War misery of the past,” the letter said. McDonald’s, which opened its first store in Russia in the dying days of the Soviet Union in 1990, is a very visible symbol of American capitalism in Russia, where it now has 438 branches. The food safety watchdog ordered the closure of four of its restaurants in Moscow on Wednesday, including that first Russian branch, which is the busiest in the firm’s global network. The watchdog said on Thursday it was starting unscheduled checks in several Russian regions, including Sverdlovsk and Tatarstan in the Urals, the central Voronezh region and the region around the capital. “We are aware of what is going on. We have always been and are now open to any checks,” a McDonald’s Russia spokeswoman said. So far no other prominent Western brand has reported coming under extra scrutiny from the Russian authorities, though there were Russian media reports that Jack Daniels was being investigated. The whiskey producer said it would challenge any accusations about its quality. Amrest, the Warsaw-listed holder of the Russian franchises for several other iconic U.S. brands — Starbucks, KFC, Pizza Hut and Burger King — said last week it had experienced no problems and was doing well. “We are monitoring closely recent geopolitical developments, to make sure we can adapt to changing conditions and minimise business risks,” said AmRest’s chairman Henry McGovern during a teleconference with investors last week. Nevertheless, big foreign brands are viewed as vulnerable. French bank Societe Generale published on Thursday a research note saying companies generating most revenues in Russia and therefore most exposed to political risks were BP (BP.L), British American Tobacco (BATS.L), BASF (BASFn.DE), Carlsberg (CARLb.CO), Coca-Cola (KO.N), Alstom (ALSO.PA) and E.ON (EONGn.DE). Even some of McDonald’s rivals came to its defence. “This is a major blow to relations between the two countries,” Mikhail Goncharov, the owner of Russian fast-food chain Teremok, told RBC Daily, a newspaper. “Even the Soviet Union was maintaining those relations because the first McDonald’s opened during the USSR times, and PepsiCo PEP.N factories continued to function regardless of political crises,” he added. Since McDonald’s first broke into Russia, it has for many Russian consumers been overshadowed by hundreds of swanky French and Japanese restaurants in the Russian capital, but it remains a powerful symbol, and therefore a prominent target. On Thursday, outside the shuttered restaurant on Moscow’s Pushkin Square, the closure stirred patriotic sentiment among some people. “They occasionally kick us with different sanctions. Why can’t we do something in return? Moreover, McDonald’s is such a symbol of everything Western, I think it is a good symbolic step that shows that we have some teeth,” said Ivan.

542,MCD,China tries five cult members for McDonald's murder,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China tried five members of a banned religious group on Thursday for the murder of a woman who was beaten to death at a McDonald’s restaurant after she refused to give them her telephone number when they apparently tried to recruit her. China has sentenced dozens of followers of Quannengshen, or the Church of Almighty God, since the murder of the woman in May in the eastern province of Shandong. One man and four women were charged with murder and with illegal cult activities, according to the court in Shandong’s Yantai city. The court’s official microblog carried pictures of the five, dressed in orange jackets identifying them as the accused, with about a dozen policemen standing behind them. “The facts are clear and there is plenty of evidence,” Gao Cheng, the lawyer for the murdered woman’s family, was quoted as saying by the People’s Daily on its website. The accused had shown no sign of repentance and so should be severely punished, Gao said. The court said the accused were allowed to defend themselves, but gave no details.  The trial, lasting just a single day as is common in China, ended by late afternoon with the court saying a verdict would be announced at a later date. Chinese authorities have arrested nearly 1,000 members of Quannengshen, state media said this week, the latest in a series of official moves against the group. Li Ming, online editor for the state-backed China Anti-Cult Association, told the Sina news portal that China had at least 20 such cults, who had “coerced” millions of people. “Once you have been brain-washed it’s very hard to get out. Because you have utter belief,” Li said. The Quannengshen group, which originated in central Henan province, believes that Jesus was resurrected as Yang Xiangbin, wife of the sect’s founder, Zhao Weishan, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Zhao is also known as Xu Wenshan, Xinhua said, adding that the couple fled to the United States in September 2000. In 2012, China launched a crackdown on the group after it called for a “decisive battle” to slay the “Red Dragon” Communist Party, and preached that the world would end that year. The party brooks no challenge to its rule and is obsessed with social stability. It has cracked down on cults, which have multiplied in recent years. Demonstrations have been put down with force and some sect leaders executed. Former President Jiang Zemin launched a campaign in 1999 to crush the Falun Gong religious group, banning it as an “evil cult” after thousands of practitioners staged a surprise but peaceful sit-in outside the leadership compound in Beijing to demand official recognition of their movement.

543,MCD,UPDATE 2-Russia extends scrutiny of McDonald's restaurants,"* Food safety watchdog to check outlets across Russia * Cites complaints about quality and safety * Regulator has already shut four restaurants in Moscow * U.S.-Russia ties soured by Ukraine crisis   (Adds McDonald’s comment, checks underway in more regions) By Polina Devitt MOSCOW, Russia, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Russia ramped up its scrutiny of McDonald’s restaurants on Thursday, as the state food safety watchdog began unscheduled checks in several Russian regions, a day after four branches in Moscow were shuttered by the same agency. The food safety agency cited breaches of sanitary rules by restaurants in the fast food chain, but the action came after Moscow and the West imposed tit-for-tat sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine. The agency denied that its actions were politically motivated. “There are complaints about the quality and safety of the products in fast food restaurant chain McDonald’s,” said the regulatory agency, known in Russian as Rospotrebnadzor. It declined to comment on the scope of the planned checks. The regulator said on Thursday it is already conducting checks at McDonald’s outlets in the Ural mountains region of Sverdlovsk, the Volga region of Tatarstan, the central Voronezh region and the Moscow region. It also plans checks in the republic of Bashkortostan and the southern Krasnodar region. Some of the checks are unscheduled. Natalya Lukyantseva, an official of the regulator’s branch in the Sverdlovsk region, said checks had been started because of complaints from customers. “We are aware of what is going on. We have always been and are now open to any checks,” McDonald’s Russian spokeswoman said. She could not comment on the reasons for the checks. On Wednesday, the agency ordered the suspension of operations at four McDonald’s restaurants in Moscow over what it said were “numerous” sanitary law breaches. The shuttered restaurants include one on Moscow’s Pushkin Square, which McDonald’s says is the busiest in its global network of restaurants. For a generation of Russians who saw the first McDonald’s open in the dying days of the Soviet Union in 1990, the restaurants were a symbol of American capitalism. For most Muscovites now, they are just a part of the urban landscape. McDonald’s operates 438 restaurants in Russia and considers the country one of its top seven major markets outside the United States and Canada, according to its 2013 annual report. Last month, Rospotrebnadzor’s branch in the Novgorod region opened a court case against McDonald’s as a result of the June inspections of its restaurants. It said at the time that McDonald’s was deceiving consumers about the energy value of its burgers and about nutritional value of its desserts, and that its vegetable salad were contaminated with harmful bacteria.

549,MCD,McDonald's replaces U.S. chief for the second time in two years,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp is replacing its U.S. president for the second time in two years, a move that suggests increased pressure on Chief Executive Don Thompson to improve sales in the fast food chain’s home market. The company on Friday named former McDonald’s executive Mike Andres as president of McDonald’s USA, replacing Jeff Stratton, who had been in the job since December 2012. McDonald’s said Stratton, 58, is retiring.  Since last November, the world’s biggest fast-food chain by revenue has suffered flat or declining monthly sales at its established U.S. stores. Among other things, analysts blame bloated menus for slower service, and said pressure has intensified from resurgent rivals such as Wendy’s Co and Burger King Worldwide Inc. “It’s hard to argue that this type of turnover doesn’t put more scrutiny on a CEO,” Bernstein Research analyst Sara Senatore said of the U.S. management change.  “If results stay weak despite turnover in these executive roles, then ultimately it’s the responsibility of the CEO.” Thompson, who became president and CEO in July 2012, has presided over a period of disappointing results from the U.S. region due in part to internal missteps, brutal competition and cautious spending by the lower-income consumers that frequent the chain. In selecting Andres, who currently is the CEO of Nashville-based Logan’s Roadhouse, McDonald’s took the “rare” step of choosing an outside executive to lead the U.S. business, said Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Howard Penney. Stratton was McDonald’s chief restaurant officer prior to being named president of the U.S. division.  “They’re desperate,” said Penney, who is among Wall Street’s most bearish restaurant analysts. Still, Penney said Thompson likely has until the end of 2015 to show improvement in the business because some issues are seen by investors to be beyond his control, such as the U.S. economy and Russia, which shut some of McDonald’s branches in Moscow this week. The Moscow closures were widely viewed as retaliation for Western sanctions against Russia  Franchisees, investors and analysts have urged McDonald’s to simplify its menus to better compete with the likes of In-N-Out Burger and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. Thompson has promised to get back to basics at McDonald’s USA. At the same time, he is introducing new kitchen equipment that will allow diners to customize their hamburgers and sandwiches, a strategy that has fallen flat with critics. Andres, 56, will take over on Oct. 15. He rejoins McDonald’s after serving as chairman and CEO of Logan’s Roadhouse, a chain with 261 full-service restaurants in 23 states. He also will oversee McDonald’s Canada business. Andres started his career at the Golden Arches as manager of his family-owned McDonald’s in northern California. During his 30 years he was president and CEO of Boston Market, then a McDonald’s subsidiary, and president of McDonald’s central U.S. division, the company said. Shares in McDonald’s edged down 10 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $94.43 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

551,MCD,Russia keeps up pressure on McDonald's with new inspections,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian authorities extended their scrutiny of McDonald’s (MCD.N) to several regions on Friday, carrying out inspections at a number of restaurants run by the U.S. fast-food chain, amid a standoff with the West over Ukraine. The inspections are viewed by many businessmen as retaliation for Western sanctions against Russia because of its support for separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, and they fear the retribution could spread to other symbols of Western capitalism.  A spokeswoman for the country’s food safety agency, Rospotrebnadzor, said the inspections were not related to the standoff. “The checks are not politically motivated,” she said. The agency also said it had no plans to close down the company’s business in the Republic of Tatarstan, two days after the agency shut three McDonald’s branches in Moscow. Checks in Tatarstan were announced on Thursday. An agency spokeswoman in Tatarstan’s largest city, Kazan, said checks were under way at McDonald’s, which has 17 restaurants in the region - one of the highest concentrations in Russia outside Moscow and St Petersburg. “We are making checks there. There are some irregularities and we are likely to punish them, but we will not close down their restaurants,” she said. The regulators had earlier extended the checks outside of Moscow, including in Central Russia and the Urals. The agency’s branch in the Penza region said on Friday that its unscheduled checks at two McDonald’s restaurants in August showed that nine products out of the 31 inspected did not meet regulatory requirements, without specifying what they were. After laboratory studies, three batches of products weighing a total of 38 kilograms were deemed unfit for consumption, the agency said in a statement on its website. It drew up 10 statements of administrative violations, the statement said. McDonald’s declined an immediate comment. Local press also reported that it plans to begin inspections in the North-West Leningrad region on Aug. 25. A regional official declined to comment. McDonald’s operates 440 restaurants in Russia and considers the country one of its top seven markets outside the United States and Canada, according to its 2013 annual report. Almost 1 million people a day use its restaurants in Russia. In Tatarstan, some 1,500 people work for the fast-food chain.

575,MCD,Fast-food workers to launch intensified protests across U.S.,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s line cooks, Burger King cashiers and other fast-food restaurant workers across the U.S. plan to walk off the job on Thursday in an ongoing battle with their employers to gain a $15 hourly wage, organizers said on Monday. The protests, announced on Twitter by organizer Fight For 15, come as cities across the nation propose minimum wage increases while Democrats seek to raise the federal minimum wage ahead of this year’s mid-term congressional elections. Fast food workers have launched a series of protests over the last nearly two years to bring awareness to their demands, which include the right to unionize without retaliation. In one of the last major actions, restaurant workers launched rallies in 150 cities, including Boston, Chicago, New York and Miami in May.  This time, organizers are staging walkouts in more than 100 cities and plan to use nonviolent civil disobedience tactics such as sit-ins, The New York Times reported. Unlike the protest in May, thousands of home care workers are expected to join in solidarity, the Times reported.

577,MCD,"U.S. fast-food workers protest over pay, hundreds arrested","NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. fast-food workers staged protests in some 150 cities on Thursday in a fight for higher pay, and organizers said more than 450 were arrested from Manhattan’s Times Square to Los Angeles. About 400 protesters clogged Times Square during morning rush hour in the latest of ongoing actions aimed at raising their wage to $15 an hour.  They hoisted placards reading “Stick together for $15 and union rights,” and some held a sit-in at a McDonald’s restaurant, prompting 19 arrests for disorderly conduct. Sit-ins also were held in other cities, and organizers said 465 arrests were made among protesters from Chicago, Detroit, Little Rock, Arkansas, Kansas City, Houston and Nashville. In Los Angeles, protesters confronted managers inside two McDonald’s restaurants. And near Milwaukee, U.S. Representative Gwen Moore was among 27 people arrested.  McDonald’s worker Latoya Walker, who lives in a homeless shelter in Queens and makes $8 per hour, joined Thursday’s march for her five young children. “With $15, I’d be able to save up enough to rent a home for my kids,” Walker said.  Protest organizers said Thursday’s actions were the biggest to date, targeting chains including McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s and KFC. In Kansas City, protester Dana Wittman, 38, said the $9 an hour she makes at Pizza Hut is not enough for her family. “I have to choose between paying my rent and putting food on the table,” she said.  The recurring union-backed actions, which started in New York City, have steadily gathered steam since late 2012. They have helped spur a national debate about the federal minimum wage, which has been $7.25 since 2009, despite efforts by Democrats in Congress to raise it ahead of November’s mid-term congressional elections. Protesters, many of whom are adults working 40 hours or more a week, say they cannot survive on such pay. Experts say about $11 an hour is the poverty threshold for a family of four.  U.S. fast-food restaurants this year are expected to make profits of $7.2 billion on revenue of $198.9 billion, according to research firm IBISWorld. Most of their U.S. restaurants are owned by franchisees, who set their own wages and say that raising the hourly wage will hurt their businesses. Workers claimed a victory in July when the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board said McDonald’s, not just its franchisees, can be liable for alleged labor law violations. But experts say it could take months, if not years, to resolve the cases. A McDonald’s spokeswoman said the world’s biggest fast-food chain supports paying wages that are competitive in local markets and reflect a worker’s skill and experience. The drive is being led by the Service Employees International Union, which has 2 million members. The International Franchise Association said unions want “a shortcut to refill their steadily dwindling membership ranks and coffers.” ",9042014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-restaurants-protests/u-s-fast-food-workers-protest-over-pay-hundreds-arrested-idUSKBN0GZ0A620140904

580,MCD,McDonald's August same-store sales fall across regions,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) on Tuesday reported declining sales at established restaurants across all regions in August, the fifth monthly drop since CEO Don Thompson took the helm in July 2012, and warned a China supplier scandal would cut into profits. The company, which has been battling internal missteps, competition and shifting consumer tastes, said the supplier issue that crushed sales in China and Japan would reduce third-quarter profit by 15 to 20 cents per share.   Expectations were low ahead of the monthly report and shares in McDonald’s barely budged on the news, falling 0.7 percent to $91.83 in early trading. Thompson is under mounting pressure to improve results at the world’s biggest fast-food chain by revenue.  Among other things, analysts blame bloated menus for slower service and say the company is struggling to compete with resurgent rivals such as Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N as well as privately held chains such as In-N-Out Burger and Chick-fil-A.

581,MCD,UPDATE 2-McDonald's August same-store sales fall across regions,"(Adds details, analyst comment, byline) By Lisa Baertlein Sept 9 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp on Tuesday reported declining sales at established restaurants across all regions in August, the fifth monthly drop since CEO Don Thompson took the helm in July 2012, and warned a China supplier scandal would cut into profits. The company, which has been battling internal missteps, competition and shifting consumer tastes, said the supplier issue that crushed sales in China and Japan would reduce third-quarter profit by 15 to 20 cents per share. Expectations were low ahead of the monthly report and shares in McDonald’s barely budged on the news, falling 0.7 percent to $91.83 in early trading. Thompson is under mounting pressure to improve results at the world’s biggest fast-food chain by revenue. Among other things, analysts blame bloated menus for slower service and say the company is struggling to compete with resurgent rivals such as Wendy’s Co and Burger King Worldwide Inc as well as privately held chains such as In-N-Out Burger and Chick-fil-A.

582,MCD,US STOCKS-McDonald's shares lower after August sales,"NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Shares of McDonald’s Corp  are lower in premarket trading on Tuesday, with the fast food giant down 0.6 percent at $91.95 in the wake of its August sales data. The company reported a drop of 3.7 percent in its worldwide comparable sales, with U.S. sales down 2.8 percent. The stock has been struggling this year, down 4.7 percent, vastly underperforming the S&P; 500 and falling under key moving averages - a sign of weak price momentum. McDonald’s is the third-worst performing Dow component in 2014, behind only General Electric and Boeing Co. While the fast food space has in general been weak this year - Yum Brands is down 4.3 percent and Wendy’s Co  is off 8 percent - Burger King Worldwide is bucking that trend, with a year-to-date gain of 41 percent. Despite that, McDonald’s is considered inexpensive based on StarMine’s intrinsic value, which looks at anticipated growth over the next decade. That metric indicates that McDonald’s should be trading at $101.30. Futures snapshot at 8:23: * S&P; 500 e-minis are falling 1.25 points, or 0.06 percent, with 120,830 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis are gaining 0.5 points, or 0.01 percent, in volume of 22,912 contracts. * Dow e-minis are down 15 points, or 0.09 percent, with 22,427 contracts changing hands.

586,MCD,UPDATE 2-Beer sponsor Anheuser-Busch reproaches NFL over domestic abuse,"(Adds statement from McDonald’s, other corporations) By Steve Ginsburg and Anjali Athavaley Sept 16 (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch publicly chastised the National Football League on Tuesday for its handling of domestic violence cases, making the NFL’s official beer sponsor the first major advertiser to put pressure on America’s most popular sports league. In a brief but strongly worded statement, Anheuser-Busch, the maker of Budweiser and NFL official beer Bud Light, said it was “disappointed and increasingly concerned by the recent incidents that have overshadowed this NFL season. “We are not yet satisfied with the league’s handling of behaviors that so clearly go against our own company culture and moral code.” The company, owned by Belgian-Brazilian group Anheuser-Busch InBev, said it had shared its concerns and expectations with the 32-team league, a TV ratings juggernaut that brings in $9 billion in annual revenue. “We understand,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said of the Anheuser-Busch remarks. “We are taking action and there will be much more to come.” Another NFL sponsor and mainstay of American culture, McDonald’s Corp, said it also communicated its concerns to the league and expects the NFL “to take strong and necessary actions to address these issues.” Visa Inc, Campbell’s Soup Co and Procter & Gamble’s cosmetic’s unit Covergirl also issued similar statements this week. The rebuke from Corporate America could raise pressure on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, already struggling to make amends after his initial light punishment of former Baltimore Ravens star Ray Rice for  punching his then-girlfriend, now his wife, in February. The NFL and team owners are also dealing with at least three other domestic abuse cases and a wide swath of Americans are closely watching how they react to mounting public pressure to take forceful measures with players who engage in domestic violence. When a security video emerged last week of Rice knocking his wife out cold, Goodell suspended Rice indefinitely and said he had not seen that video when he handed down his original two-game ban in July. He had, however, seen a previous video showing Rice dragging an unconscious Janay Rice out of the elevator. Goodell apologized for his initial punishment and has since increased the mandatory ban to six games for domestic violence. After the second video emerged and reports that the NFL had seen it, the league ordered an independent investigation into the handling of the Rice case. Rice, 27, has until midnight ET on Tuesday to appeal his suspension. Compounding the NFL’s problems last week was the indictment of Adrian Peterson, the Minnesota Vikings running back - one of the league’s most marketable stars - who has been charged with child abuse in Texas for beating his son with a tree branch. Peterson was reactivated by the Vikings on Monday after sitting out Sunday’s game. On Tuesday, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton entered the fray by saying the Vikings should sideline Peterson until his case works its way through court. The Radisson hotel chain said it was suspending a sponsorship deal with the Vikings as it monitors the case. Two other players involved in domestic violence cases are also under the league’s microscope, Greg Hardy of the Carolina Panthers and Ray McDonald of the San Francisco 49ers. After the alarming video of Rice’s punch surfaced last week, NFL experts said that advertisers could play a pivotal role in whether Goodell survives the worst crisis of his eight-year tenure. Verizon Communications Chief Executive Lowell McAdam, while acknowledging the Rice episode had been disturbing, gave his backing to Goodell, calling him “a man of high integrity.” But as the controversy moved into the homes of millions of Americans, troubled by what they had seen on the video, Anheuser-Busch’s move suggests a changing sentiment among the game’s stalwart corporate backers. “I’m not surprised by it. I think there is such attention of what’s going on with the NFL off the field,” Brad Adgate, senior vice president, director of research at Horizon Media, an advertising services agency. The swirling domestic violence scandal has also called into question the NFL’s relationship with women, a demographic it has actively wooed. Women now account for 45 percent of the league’s audience. One sponsor geared toward women fans, Covergirl, said on its Facebook page Monday that “we have encouraged the NFL to take swift action on their path forward to address the issue of domestic violence.”   (Additional reporting by Jennifer Saba in New York and Eric Kelsey in Los Angeles; Writing by Mary Milliken; Editing by Howard Goller, Bernard Orr)",9162014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-nfl/update-2-beer-sponsor-anheuser-busch-reproaches-nfl-over-domestic-abuse-idUSL1N0RH2QN20140916
587,MCD,Republicans query U.S. labor board on McDonald's liability view,"Sept 17 (Reuters) - Two Republican lawmakers on Wednesday asked a U.S. labor agency for more information about a recent finding that fast-food chain McDonald’s Corp could be held liable for the labor practices of franchisees, a view that has alarmed many businesses. The lawmakers said the Democratic-controlled National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is trying to rewrite long-held rules governing labor relations between parent companies and franchises that are run as independent businesses. The questioning comes just as fast-food workers are staging nationwide protests to push for higher wages, in a major union-led organization drive. NLRB General Counsel Richard Griffin announced in July that the world’s largest restaurant chain could be held liable for alleged labor law violations at franchised restaurants. Until now, McDonald’s and other companies that make wide use of franchisees and contract employers have been insulated from such liability by the NLRB’s “joint employer” standard. U.S. Representatives John Kline and Phil Roe, in a letter to the agency, called the NLRB general counsel’s finding “unprecedented” and asked the board to provide more documents by the end of September about its decision-making. The two Republicans are on the U.S. House of Representatives workforce committee. “Our question is, what problem are you attempting to fix? We know that the franchise business model works well,” Roe said in a telephone interview. The NLRB said it had no comment on the letter, which was being reviewed by the Office of General Counsel. The board announced in April that it was considering changing the 30-year-old standard and asked interested parties to weigh in. The board has yet to make a decision. Griffin’s brief announcement in July related to 43 complaints lodged against McDonald’s and was just a first step in a long process for handling charges filed by workers with the NLRB. McDonald’s has said it will contest the action. Several owners of small franchise chains testified at a congressional hearing last week that any permanent shift in the board’s policy could lead to more meddling in their operations by parent companies. Catherine Ruckelshaus, an attorney at the National Employment Law Project, a low-wage workers advocacy group, said in a phone interview that changes in NLRB standards are needed to adapt to the modern workplace. “Everyone is pointing fingers at everyone else and no one is being held accountable or responsible.” In a separate hearing on Wednesday, House Republicans criticized the Obama administration’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for “harassing” employers with unsubstantiated charges. Republican Representative Tim Walberg said in a statement some “employers have fallen under EEOC’s intense scrutiny without any allegation of employment discrimination.” Walberg is pushing for legislative proposals for more EEOC oversight. Michael Foreman, director of the Civil Rights Appellate Clinic at Pennsylvania State University’s Dickinson School, said the proposals would hamper the EEOC’s ability to enforce the law. “There’s no pattern of EEOC abuse,” he said.

588,MCD,WRAPUP 2-Vikings admit 'mistake' on Peterson; sponsors pressure NFL,"(Recasts, adds comments from NFL sponsor TD Ameritrade, Vikings owner, Nancy Pelosi, background) By Eric Kelsey Sept 17 (Reuters) - Grievances against the NFL’s response to domestic abuse cases gathered pace on Wednesday as the Minnesota Vikings acknowledged making a mistake with its treatment of star player Adrian Peterson and corporate sponsors joined the chorus of discontent with America’s top sports league. Brokerage firm TD Ameritrade, which began a three-year affiliation with the NFL this month, said “it was very much considering its future” as a sponsor. Nike Inc  said it had suspended its contract with Peterson. The Vikings on Wednesday issued the latest mea culpa from the NFL. A flurry of domestic violence cases, most notably those of Peterson and Ray Rice, the Baltimore Ravens star who has been suspended indefinitely, has raised questions about the league’s integrity and the leadership of commissioner Roger Goodell. Even members of Congress are speaking out. The Vikings, which on Monday reactivated Peterson for this Sunday’s NFL game following his indictment last week in Texas in a case involving his 4-year-old son, reversed course by placing him on a special exempt list that suspends him from all team activities. “We made a mistake, and we needed to get this right,” Vikings co-owner Zygi Wilf said at a news conference, adding that he and his brother, Vikings co-owner Mark Wilf, had listened to “our fans, the community and our sponsors.” The 29-year-old Peterson, the Vikings’ best player, has been accused of reckless or negligent injury to a child, stemming from a whipping incident that allegedly left bruises and wounds on his son. The NFL called his suspension “a good decision.” The Vikings will continue to pay the running back his full $11.75 million salary for this season. Team general manager Rick Spielman declined to say whether Peterson would play again this season. If Peterson’s case goes to trial it would likely begin in 2015. Corporate America has piled onto the criticism this week. The moves from TD Ameritrade and Nike come a day after the NFL was chastised by one of its top sponsors, brewer Anheuser-Busch. “We want to see (the NFL) learn from its mistakes and work quickly to improve a culture that values inclusion, safety and respect for its employees, their families and others,” TD Ameritrade spokeswoman Kim Hillyer said in an email. Nike Inc, which has a reputation for steadfastly sticking by its top athletes, issued a statement on its decision to suspend its contract with Peterson, one of the most marketable players in the league. “Nike in no way condones child abuse or domestic violence of any kind and we have shared our concerns with the NFL,” the Oregon-based sporting goods company said in a statement. Mark Wilf said the franchise did not suspend Peterson in a bow to pressure from team sponsors. Minnesota-based hotel chain Radisson suspended a sponsorship deal with the Vikings on Monday. The team also came under pressure from Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton, who said on Tuesday that Peterson was a “public embarrassment” to the team and state and should be suspended. Several other NFL sponsors, such as McDonald’s Corp, Visa Inc and Campbell Soup Co said they have voiced their concerns to the league about its handling of domestic violence cases. But no sponsor has gone so far as to cut its multimillion-dollar ties with the NFL. Goodell and the league are struggling to make amends for his initial lenient punishment of Rice, who punched his then-fiancee, now his wife, in February, striking her unconscious. Although Goodell has announced stricter penalties for domestic violence offenders, that has done little to stem the tidal wave of public criticism following the release of surveillance video last week that showed Rice’s punch, which the league said it had never seen. On Wednesday, U.S. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said Congress could get involved because the league, which takes in $9 billion in annual revenue, has an anti-trust exemption. “I think Congress always has a role, but again if you’re talking about anti-trust privileges and the rest of that, that certainly is a big issue and it cannot be done except by the Congress,” Pelosi said at her weekly news conference in the Capitol, after being peppered with NFL questions. Goodell has since apologized for the handling of the Rice case. The Pro Bowl running back on Tuesday appealed his indefinite suspension, which came after the video’s publication. Two other players involved in domestic violence cases are Carolina Panthers’ Greg Hardy, who was benched last week, and San Francisco 49ers’ Ray McDonald, who played. Pelosi, an avid 49ers fan, said McDonald should not have taken the field.

589,MCD,California bill would help protect franchisee business investments,"LOS ANGELES - When Kathryn Slater-Carter learned her family would lose $1.5 million after McDonald’s Corp did not renew the franchise agreement on one of their restaurants in the San Francisco suburbs, she tried for a second time to change state law to protect franchisee investments. That renewed effort may bear some fruit. California lawmakers in August passed the new bill she championed and Governor Jerry Brown has until Sept. 30 to sign or veto it. At present, California law only requires franchisors that terminate or fail to renew a franchise agreement to offer to repurchase a franchisee’s inventory. Among other things, the pending legislation known as SB 610 would require a franchisor that terminates an agreement without a material breach to compensate the franchisee for the fair value of their business, or to provide them an opportunity to sell. The watered-down law passed by lawmakers would not have prevented the equity loss Slater-Carter says her family suffered when their McDonald’s restaurant in a Daly City, California, shopping mall was forced to close, but “it’s a start,” she said. The franchise agreement on her family’s one remaining Daly City restaurant expires in 2016. A spokeswoman for McDonald’s said that the mall restaurant closed because the franchise and lease agreements each expired. She added that the company did not play a part in that timing. Groups representing big companies and franchisees have clashed over the bill in what some experts say is one of California’s biggest business battles this year. The International Franchise Association (IFA), a trade group representing McDonald’s and other well-funded franchisors, led the opposition. They warn that the legislation could weaken a franchisor’s ability to enforce brand standards, damage franchisee equity by protecting weak operators and result in frivolous lawsuits.      Supporters are a coalition that includes the American Association of Franchisees & Dealers and the Service Employees International Union, which has backed fast-food worker protests at franchisee-owned restaurants. They say changes are long overdue and that other states, including Washington, have stronger laws in place. “It gives us a little bit of protection against termination and retaliation,” said Jaspreet Dhillon, chairman of the California 7-Eleven Franchisee Political Action Committee. “The bill won’t solve everything, but it allows us to sleep at night.” Franchisor 7-Eleven Inc, owned by Tokyo-based Seven & I Holdings, in the last two years has been hit with roughly a dozen lawsuits in which franchisees alleged that it drummed up reasons to take away their convenience stores.   A 7-Eleven spokeswoman said those allegations are false and that the company ends relationships with the “few franchisees who violate the law or the franchise agreement” to protect other franchisees, employees and customers.

591,MCD,"OSI cuts 340 workers from embattled Shanghai plant, shutdown looms","SHANGHAI, Sept 22 (Reuters) - U.S. food firm OSI Group LLC  has cut 340 jobs at its embattled Shanghai plant, which supplied McDonald’s Corp and Yum Brands Inc , bringing the facility close to shutdown, the firm said in a statement on its website on Monday. OSI’s Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd plant came under the spotlight in July when an undercover Chinese media report showed workers were using expired meat and doctoring production dates. The scandal, which spread as far as Hong Kong and Japan, sparked a Chinese probe into the firm and dragged down China sales at KFC-parent Yum and McDonald’s, which have both since cut or suspended ties with Aurora, Illinois-based OSI. “Over the past two months, Shanghai Husi has experienced significant financial and customer losses and the authorities’ investigations are still ongoing. It is very unlikely that production will be resumed soon,” OSI said in the statement. It added that a small of number of Shanghai Husi staff would be kept on to assist with the ongoing investigation. “As such, Shanghai Husi cannot be fully shut down at this stage,” the firm added. Yum has fully cut ties with OSI in China, while McDonald’s has suspended its ties with the firm pending the outcome of a Chinese investigation. China is Yum’s biggest market and McDonald’s third largest by outlets. The incident - just one of a series of food safety issues to hit China over the past year - has underlined the challenge of regulating supply chains in China, where food scandals can have a major impact on a firm’s sales and reputation. OSI said it had stated a redundancy programme for the Shanghai plant on Monday. A total of 340 staff would be made redundant, including 226 directly employed by Shanghai Husi and a further 114 contractors. “It was our expectation that they could resume their work as soon as possible. Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond our control, this will not be the case,” the firm added. A series of firms including retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc , French grocer Carrefour SA and ketchup maker HJ Heinz Co have all been caught in food safety scares in China.

592,MCD,China sentences two cult members to death for McDonald's murder,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Saturday sentenced two members of a banned religious cult - a father and daughter - to death for the murder in a McDonald’s restaurant of a woman who refused an apparent attempt by the group to recruit her, state media said. The 37-year-old woman, surnamed Wu, was attacked in May in the eastern province of Shandong by members of Quannengshen, the Church of Almighty God, which had preached that a global apocalypse would take place in 2012. The case sparked a national outcry after it was revealed that Wu was beaten to death for refusing to give her telephone number to members of the group.  The Yantai Intermediate People’s Court sentenced Zhang Fan and her father, Zhang Lidong, to death for intentional homicide and gave another member of the group, Lu Yingchun, life in prison, the official Xinhua news agency said. “Zhang Hang and Zhang Qiaolian, another two cult members, were sentenced to ten and seven years of jail terms respectively,” Xinhua said.  Zhang Hang is also a daughter of Zhang Lidong. Xinhua did not report ages of the five defendants, who were tried in August. According to Xinhua, Zhang Fan and Lu had called Wu an “evil spirit” and the group beat, kicked, and stomped on her head until she died on the scene. The Quannengshen group, which originated in central Henan province, believes that Jesus was resurrected as Yang Xiangbin, wife of the sect’s founder, Zhao Weishan, according to previous  Xinhua reports. Zhao is also known as Xu Wenshan, Xinhua has said, adding that the couple fled to the United States in September 2000. In 2012, China launched a crackdown on the group, which  called for a “decisive battle” to slay the “Red Dragon” Communist Party, and preached that the world would end that year. The party brooks no challenge to its rule and is obsessed with social stability. It has cracked down on cults, which have multiplied in recent years. Demonstrations have been put down with force and some sect leaders executed. In 1999, then-President Jiang Zemin launched a campaign to crush the Falun Gong religious group. It was banned as “evil cult” after thousands of practitioners staged a surprise but peaceful sit-in outside the leadership compound in Beijing to demand official recognition of their movement.

593,MCD,McDonald's CEO acknowledges image problems after tough results,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson owned up to some corporate image problems on Tuesday after it posted a nearly one-third drop in quarterly profit and warned that its global restaurant sales would fall again this month. Stock in the fast-food chain, which Thompson conceded is sometimes seen as little more than “a manufacturing plant,” was down 0.6 percent at $91 in afternoon trading after reporting a 30 percent fall in third-quarter net income to $1.07 billion and traffic declines in every major region. Thompson, who has been CEO for just over two years of his 25-year career at McDonald’s, said the company that now serves some 70 million customers a day worldwide has at various times during its history faced questions about whether it is still relevant to consumers, who are now craving more fresh, unprocessed food.   “McDonald’s is in the business of satisfying customers and that will never fall out of favor. The question is what do you do to do that?” Thompson asked Reuters in a telephone interview. McDonald’s has posted a string of disappointing results, due to uncontrollable factors and internal missteps, since Thompson took the helm in July 2012.  Wall Street analysts, many of whom underscore McDonald’s deliberate business style, predict that the company will give Thompson at least a year to move the needle. To that end, Thompson said McDonald’s is simplifying menus, tailoring food to local tastes, offering custom burger and sandwich options, rolling out mobile services such as payments and ordering, and opening a social media “dialogue” with customers. Technology has made customized ordering simpler and will give McDonald’s the opportunity to showcase its fresh produce and other ingredients, Thompson said. Last week, McDonald’s launched a U.S. online campaign called “Our food. Your questions.” and invited consumers to ask anything about its food. It opened the campaign by directly addressing food-quality rumors with questions such as: “Is ‘pink slime’ in a Chicken McNugget?” “Why doesn’t your food rot?” “Are there worms in your beef?”    Thus far, the response has been mixed.  Survey data from YouGov BrandIndex showed that the campaign, coupled with McDonald’s recent Monopoly game promotion, appeared to temporarily lift quality perception and purchase consideration in the younger, sought-after Millennial demographic that favors the likes of Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N). Nevertheless, McDonald’s key demographic of frequent fast-food eaters were largely unmoved by the campaigns, YouGov spokesman Drew Kerr said. “When you’ve been around for multiple decades like McDonald’s has, you can’t change on a dime,” said Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski. When it comes to changing perception, Thompson acknowledged that the company has work to do. “We’ve largely been viewed as a manufacturing plant. They haven’t seen the food,” said Thompson.  McDonald’s quarterly results showed sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell a steeper-than-expected 3.3 percent in the United States, where smaller and more nimble fast-food rivals as well as Chipotle, known for using pricier antibiotic-free meats and organic produce, are taking a bite out of McDonald’s market share. Chipotle on Monday reported an eye-popping 19.8 percent gain in third-quarter, same-restaurant sales.     McDonald’s Europe sales at established restaurants fell 1.4 percent, hurt by economic weakness in regional powerhouse Germany and dragged down by political upheaval in Ukraine and Russia, formerly a fast-growing market for McDonald’s.     McDonald’s Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit said same-restaurant sales tumbled 9.9 percent, after this summer’s China supplier scandal pummeled sales around the region.  Executives said same-restaurant sales in China fell 22.7 percent during the latest quarter. They added that it could take  six to nine months for the business to normalize in affected markets, including China, Japan and Hong Kong.

594,MCD,Strong dollar hurts profits of U.S. companies,"NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The strong dollar is beginning to take a toll on U.S. companies with big businesses overseas. Coca Cola Co and McDonald’s Corp on Tuesday became the latest multinationals to get sideswiped by the surging U.S. currency, which typically crimps demand for U.S. exports and reduces the value of overseas sales when they are translated back into U.S. dollars. Coke, whose quarterly profit slumped 14 percent, said it now estimates that currency will have a 6 percentage-point negative impact on full-year operating income, and expects to come in below its long-term earnings per share target for 2014. McDonald’s forecast currency to cut fourth-quarter earnings per share by 5 cents to 6 cents, after shaving 1 cent off third-quarter earnings per share. Last week, Wal-Mart Stores Inc cut its annual sales forecast, pointing to a stronger dollar and the impact of food stamp reductions as the two main factors. The effects have not been restricted to companies in the consumer space: IBM on Monday said it expected dollar appreciation to have a significant impact on its fourth quarter and 2015 results - one more negative element in a generally gloomy earnings report. And United Technologies Corp on Tuesday cited the stronger U.S. currency in cutting its full-year profit forecast for its Otis elevators division, which generates a large chunk of its business outside the country, by about $50 million. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the value of the greenback against a basket of currencies made up of United States’ major trading partners, rose 7.74 percent in the third quarter. A one percentage point move in the dollar typically translates to a two percentage point impact on earnings, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Corporations are having to adjust to a new environment after more than a decade of enjoying the benefits of a relatively weak dollar on their earnings, analysts said. That means investors can expect more changes to guidance going forward. To be sure, the pain isn’t across the board. Apple Inc , which derives 60 percent of revenue from international sales, acknowledged that currency will be a headwind but did not seem overly concerned. The company forecast a strong December quarter after a higher-than-expected 16 percent jump in iPhone sales in the most recent quarter. For Coke and McDonald’s, two brands struggling to reconnect with consumers, the robust U.S. currency is a further headache. Coke, like other soft drink makers, is grappling with nearly a decade of declines in domestic soda sales as people have become more health conscious. Meanwhile, McDonald’s has been losing share among the coveted millennial demographic to more upscale brands like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. “When other things aren’t going well, you don’t need that added to the mix,” said Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist JonesTrading in Greenwich, Conn. “I think what we’re going to see over the next quarter or so are just a resetting of expectations.” That could tempt some companies to emphasize currency headwinds and downplay deeper problems with operations, said O’Rourke. But there is a downside: “When the truth eventually comes out, investors usually punch the stock.”   (Additional reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles, Lewis Krauskopf and Daniel Bases in New York, Nandita Bose and Nathan Layne in Chicago)",10212014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-earnings/strong-dollar-hurts-profits-of-u-s-companies-idUSL2N0SG2CC20141021
595,MCD,UPDATE 3-McDonald's CEO acknowledges image problems after tough results,"(Recasts with CEO and analyst comment) By Lisa Baertlein Oct 21 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson owned up to some corporate image problems on Tuesday after it posted a nearly one-third drop in quarterly profit and warned that its global restaurant sales would fall again this month. Stock in the fast-food chain, which Thompson conceded is sometimes seen as little more than “a manufacturing plant,” was down 0.6 percent at $91 in afternoon trading after reporting a 30 percent fall in third-quarter net income to $1.07 billion and traffic declines in every major region. Thompson, who has been CEO for just over two years of his 25-year career at McDonald’s, said the company that now serves some 70 million customers a day worldwide has at various times during its history faced questions about whether it is still relevant to consumers, who are now craving more fresh, unprocessed food. “McDonald’s is in the business of satisfying customers and that will never fall out of favor. The question is what do you do to do that?” Thompson asked Reuters in a telephone interview. McDonald’s has posted a string of disappointing results, due to uncontrollable factors and internal missteps, since Thompson took the helm in July 2012. Wall Street analysts, many of whom underscore McDonald’s deliberate business style, predict that the company will give Thompson at least a year to move the needle. To that end, Thompson said McDonald’s is simplifying menus, tailoring food to local tastes, offering custom burger and sandwich options, rolling out mobile services such as payments and ordering, and opening a social media “dialogue” with customers. Technology has made customized ordering simpler and will give McDonald’s the opportunity to showcase its fresh produce and other ingredients, Thompson said.

596,MCD,"UPDATE 2-Tough U.S. rivalries, China food scandal pound McDonald's","(Adds company and analyst comment, details on results) By Lisa Baertlein Oct 21 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s - which has not given investors many reasons to sing the fast-food chain’s “I’m lovin’ it” jingle - on Tuesday said quarterly profit dropped by nearly one-third and warned that global restaurant sales will fall again in October. Stock in the company, which attracted fewer customers during the third quarter, was off 0.6 percent at $91.05 in early trading. McDonald’s net income slid 30 percent to $1.07 billion, or $1.09 per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Sales at restaurants open at least 13 months, a closely watched gauge of performance, fell a steeper-than-expected 3.3 percent in the United States, where resurgent fast-food rivals and more upscale brands like Chipotle Mexican Grill are taking a bite out of market share. Europe, which just edges out the United States as McDonald’s top revenue market, is grappling with political and economic issues as McDonald’s Asia works through the upheaval from a scandal involving a major supplier in China. Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson said in a statement that the company is taking steps to revive McDonald’s global business. For example, in the United States, where McDonald’s relatively inexpensive burgers and fries are falling out of favor, the company is directly addressing rumors about its food quality. Results, thus far, seem mixed. Last week, McDonald’s launched a social media campaign called “Our food. Your questions.” The company invited consumers to ask anything about its food and got the conversation rolling with questions such as: “Is ‘pink slime’ in a Chicken McNugget?” “Why doesn’t your food rot?” “Are there worms in your beef?” The campaign, coupled with McDonald’s recent Monopoly promotion, appeared to give the company short-term lifts in quality perception and purchase consideration from the younger,  sought-after Millennial demographic that favors the likes of Chipotle, according to survey data from YouGov BrandIndex. Nevertheless, the company’s key demographic of frequent fast-food eaters were largely unmoved by the campaigns, YouGov spokesman Drew Kerr told Reuters. The reaction from moms was more complicated, Kerr said. While the Monopoly campaign persuaded them to consider a visit to the Golden Arches, quality perception declined. Europe’s sales at established restaurants fell 1.4 percent in the third quarter, hurt by economic weakness in Germany as well as political events in Ukraine and Russia, formerly a fast-growing market for McDonald’s.

598,MCD,McDonald's launches online campaign to show its food rots,"ROME, Oct 24 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - It’s not the kind of fact most food vendors want to showcase, but faced with sluggish demand for its burgers and criticism over preservatives in its products, McDonald’s has launched a campaign to prove that its food does, indeed, rot. The company seems to be responding to some negative press, including an online video purporting to show a 14-year-old hamburger which didn’t look like it had gone bad. “There have been a lot of online videos and photos touting the fact that when left out for an extended period of time, a McDonald’s hamburger does not rot and that this is because they are laden with chemicals,” food scientist Keith Warner wrote on McDonald’s official website in response to a question. “The reality is that McDonald’s hamburgers, french fries and chicken are like all foods, and do rot if kept under certain conditions.” Restaurants don’t usually splash out marketing dollars to promote the rotting of their food. But the campaign launched this month — “Our food. Your questions” — aims to do that and more. “We are taking action to restore customer trust,” Don Thompson, McDonald’s CEO said in a news release issued on Tuesday after the company reported that profits fell by nearly one-third in the last quarter. Health advocates, however, were not convinced that the new campaign can change the fortunes of one of the world’s largest restaurant chains. “Clearly, McDonald’s is on a mission to make us believe that their food is natural and fresh, but consumers are not fooled so easily,” Vicki Hird, spokeswoman for the health advocacy group Sustain, said in an email to the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Eating heavily processed fast food products will always be less nutritious and have greater levels of preservatives, flavourings and other additives compared to cooking from fresh from a known source.”        (Reporting By Chris Arsenault; Editing by Ros Russell)",10242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/foundation-food-campaign/mcdonalds-launches-online-campaign-to-show-its-food-rots-idUSL6N0SC48J20141024
599,MCD,Burger King's North America comparable sales growth best in 2 years,"(Reuters) - Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N posted its strongest growth in quarterly same-restaurant sales in North America in two years, at a time larger rival McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) is struggling in the highly competitive market. Burger King’s same-restaurant sales in the United States and Canada rose 3.6 percent in the third quarter, driven by the reintroduction of Chicken Fries and strong sales of the BBQ Bacon Whopper burger.  The company, which is acquiring Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons Inc THI.TO, has been focusing on reinventing and expanding its offerings. Burger King introduced new versions of its Whopper hamburgers and launched the King Deals value menu this year. The company, whose rivals include Wendy’s Co (WEN.O), is also benefiting from a franchise model for almost all its restaurants as it does not pay for such costs as leases and maintenance.  Analysts on average had expected the company’s North America same-restaurant sales to rise 2.5 percent in the quarter, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Burger King’s global same-restaurant sales rose 2.4 percent.  McDonald’s U.S. same-restaurant sales fell by a steeper-than-expected 3.3 percent in the third quarter.  The company has reported nearly two years of turbulent sales at established U.S. restaurants, hurt by sluggish economic growth, increased competition and internal missteps that have complicated its menus and slowed service.  Wendy’s is expected to report its results later this week, while Tim Hortons is scheduled to report on Wednesday. Burger King said in August that it would buy Tim Hortons for $11.53 billion to create the world’s third-largest fast-food restaurant group.  Through the so-called tax inversion deal, Burger King will domicile in Canada, its largest market, and avoid double taxation on profits earned abroad. Burger King reported a loss of $23.5 million, or 7 cents per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with a profit of $68.2 million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier, mainly due to expenses related to the Tim Hortons deal.  Excluding items, Burger King earned 27 cents per share. Revenue rose 1.4 percent to $278.9 million. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 27 cents per share and revenue of $282.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Burger King shares closed at $32.30 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.  Up to Monday’s close, the stock had risen about 41 percent this year, while McDonald’s shares had fallen 3.5 percent and Wendy’s shares had declined 7.7 percent.

606,MCD,UPDATE 2-McDonald's October sales fall not as steep as expected,"(Adds details results and company turnaround strategy, analyst comment) Nov 10 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s restaurant sales fell less than expected in October, the company said on Monday, but worries linger as it searches for the right recipe to compete with popular chains selling fresh made-to-order food. Worldwide sales at restaurants open at least 13 months were down 0.5 percent as the world’s biggest fast-food chain continued to fight tough U.S. competition, the after-effects of a supplier scandal in Asia, and economic and political turmoil in Europe. Analysts expected a 2.2 percent decline, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Same-restaurant sales fell 1 percent in the United States, less than the 1.9 percent decline analysts expected. Such sales have not increased at McDonald’s since October 2013. Under Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson, who took the helm in July 2012, the U.S. operation is focusing on fresh ingredients and custom sandwich toppings as it seeks to compete more effectively with popular chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and Subway, where diners pick the ingredients that go into their meals. The Golden Arches also is giving restaurant operators more control over what they put on their menus and is expanding ordering to mobile devices and kiosks. The company’s shares were unchanged at $95.10 in early trading. The changes come as McDonald’s also struggles to get a leg up on smaller and more-nimble rivals such as Wendy’s Co, Burger King Worldwide Inc, In-N-Out Burger and Chick-fil-A. “Market share declines continue to be an issue in major markets,” Stern Agee analyst Lynne Collier said in a client note. Same-restaurant sales were off 4.2 percent in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, where analysts had estimated a 6.1 percent drop. Diners shunned McDonald’s restaurants in China and Japan after a television news expose showed workers mishandling meat at a key supplier in China. McDonald’s scrambled to find new sources for ingredients to make its Chicken McNuggets and Big Macs. Europe’s comparable sales decreased 0.7 per cent due to store closures in Russia and “the significant weakening of the euro and Russian ruble.” Europe just edges out the United States as McDonald’s top revenue market.

610,MCD,China criminal gang floods market with 100 metric tons of toxic tofu,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A criminal gang in eastern China has sold almost 100 metric tons (110.23 tons) of toxic tofu onto the local market, the latest in a string of scares that have thrown light on shady practices in the country’s food industry.  The gang added industrial bleaching agent rongalite to make dried tofu sticks brighter and chewier, the Shanghai Daily reported on Monday, citing official media in Shandong province. Rongalite is banned in food production as it can lead to cancer.  Gut-wrenching food scares erupt regularly in China and highlight the challenges firms face to control supply chains.  A supplier to KFC parent Yum Brands Inc and McDonald’s Corp came under fire in July after a report showed workers using expired meat. U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc recalled some donkey meat products in January after tests showed they contained traces of fox.  Media reports made no mention if the tofu factory had supplied any large local or global chains operating in China. The local Qilu Evening News newspaper said the gang, led by three cousins, had bags of rongalite powder stacked against the walls of the factory.  The chemical was then added into the mix to make the dried tofu sticks, also called “fuzhu”, a popular snack in China. “The factory floor was filthy and there was a choking odor in the premises. Workers were busy making fuzhu with utensils that were covered in dirt,” police official Zhang Qinchao told the local paper. Police detained four men involved in the operation and seized nearly 10 metric tons of toxic tofu, but said a further 100 tonnes had already been sold by the gang within Shandong and nearby Henan and Jiangxi provinces. No one has yet been reported ill from eating the affected products, the report said.

611,MCD,California woman charged with fraud over coffee spill injury claim,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 11 (Reuters) - A California woman has been charged with fraud for falsely saying she was badly scalded by McDonald’s coffee and using photos copied off the Internet to make it appear she suffered second-degree burns on her hand, officials said. Selena Edwards, 38, of Victorville, faces 21 felony counts of fraud for filing an injury claim in which she said she was handed a cup of coffee at a McDonald’s drive-through with an improperly secured lid that allowed the hot liquid to spill on her hand, the California Department of Insurance said in a statement on Monday. The case against Edwards comes 20 years after a well-known product liability lawsuit in which Stella Liebeck won a $2.9 million civil judgment in New Mexico over burns she suffered at age 79 from hot coffee she bought at McDonald’s. That judgment, which was reduced to $480,000, became the butt of jokes and for many people symbolized the problem of frivolous lawsuits, even though Liebeck suffered third-degree burns and her defenders say media commentators were wrong to make light of her suffering. California insurance officials say Edwards, on the other hand, has fabricated her injury claim. She submitted an injury claim with photos she took off a hospital website of a burned hand she said was her own, and submitted bogus documentation describing treatment she said she received at a hospital, according to the Department of Insurance. “By copying legitimate burn photos from the Internet, Edwards attempted to make a profit from another person’s pain and suffering, and for this she will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said in a statement. Representatives from the Department of Insurance could not be reached for comment on Tuesday, and their statement did not say at which McDonald’s the woman said she had been burned. The Los Angeles Times reported that Edwards said she was burned during a Jan. 28, 2013, visit to a McDonald’s drive-through in Fontana and that she was seeking $10,000.

613,MCD,"Jana Partners in third quarter took new Valeant stake, upped eBay stake","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jana Partners LLC, the $11 billion hedge fund run by Barry Rosenstein, took a new stake in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc and vastly increased its holdings of  online auction site eBay Inc in the third quarter, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. Jana bought 1.284 million shares of Valeant, which has been trying to buy Botox-maker Allergan Inc this year. But the hostile bid soon brought scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which began looking at the potential deal in August. Jana added more than 12 million shares of eBay, bringing its total stake to 13.063 million shares. EBay this year bowed to pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn to spin off its PayPal payments service. The action is expected to give PayPal more flexibility to make deals in the rapidly evolving payments sector as growth in eBay’s traditional e-commerce business slows. Jana declined to comment. Messages to eBay and Valeant requesting comment were not immediately returned. Rosenstein’s fund also increased its stakes in Groupon Inc by 10 percent, for a total of 51.68 million shares, and increased its stake in Walgreen Co, by 12.5 percent, for a total 12.5 million shares. In September Rosenstein won a seat on the Walgreen board. Also in the third quarter, Jana took a new stake, of 300,000 shares, in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and a new stake, of 842,268 shares, in fast-food company McDonald’s Corp. Jana became the latest among activist investors - those sensing the opportunity to help turn around struggling businesses - to focus on McDonald’s. “We welcome all investments in McDonald’s,” a McDonald’s spokeswoman said. “As always, our focus is on maximizing shareholder value through initiatives that ultimately benefit our customers.” After Don Thompson became chief executive in July 2012, business at McDonald’s, which outperformed its peers during the recession, began to slow. The 13F filings with regulators made by Jana and other funds provide a window onto the strategies of some of the world’s biggest investors. But the view is limited. Not only do the documents look back to the previous quarter, they do not disclose short positions.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also sometimes allows money managers not to disclose sensitive positions.

614,MCD,Moscow's first McDonald's reopens after 90-day closure,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The first McDonald’s restaurant in Moscow reopened on Wednesday after closing for nearly a three months over health and safety violations that came as relations between Russia and the United States fell to post-Soviet lows due to the crisis in Ukraine. McDonald’s Corp’s restaurant, which opened in 1990, closed in late August in what became a string of closures throughout Russia viewed broadly as a retaliation for Western sanctions on Moscow for its role in Ukraine.  Many have reopened since, but according to the company, there are still 200 inspections ongoing and four restaurants outside Moscow remain closed. The country’s food safety agency, Rospotrebnadzor, said the closures, which came after unexpected inspections, were not related to the Russia standoff with the West.  A spokeswoman for McDonald’s Russian operations, Svetlana Polyakova, said the company has complied with Rospotrebnadzor’s demands. “McDonald’s continues to work normally,” she said. The company has 461 restaurants throughout Russia’s vast territory. This year, 45 new restaurants have opened and 25 more are to open by year-end. The growth rate is to remain unchanged next year, Polyakova said. When the now-reopened McDonald’s restaurant first opened in central Moscow on Pushkin Square, it became an iconic symbol of flourishing American capitalism during the fall of the Soviet Union. Long queues have since been typical and some people have even had their wedding receptions there. On Wednesday, the reception was more subdued, but those who came to the reopening, said they had missed the place. “When it was closed I was a bit upset to be honest,” Sergei, a Moscow resident, said. “I had to go to work with an empty bag as I could not get anything in the morning.”  Another resident, Valentina, said she was there when the restaurant opened 24 years ago and she could not miss its reopening now.  “When I come here I always ask what is the cheapest.

616,MCD,No suspense in DePaul win this time,"EditorsNote: adds Drake quotes No suspense in DePaul win this time ROSEMONT, Ill. — DePaul skipped the thrills and instead concentrated on playing 40 consistent minutes of basketball Tuesday. Blue Demons guard Billy Garrett said there were a few problematic minutes, but it is hard to quibble as DePaul claimed an 80-62 non-conference victory over Drake in its Allstate Arena home opener. “We wanted to come out today and jump out on them,” said Garrett, who collected a team-high 15 points. “We emphasized playing hard and doing the little things throughout the 40 minutes. And I think we played pretty hard, played pretty well for about 35 minutes. ... The consistency is encouraging.” Forward Myke Henry added 13 points as the Blue Demons claimed a 2-0 opening record for the first time in three seasons. DePaul trailed once early in the game and then used effective perimeter shooting to build a 38-25 halftime advantage. The Blue Demons led by as many as 20 points in the second half and the margin never slipped under double digits as forward Jamee Crockett scored 12 points, forward Forrest Robinson had 11 and guard Durrell McDonald added 10. Drake forward Chris Caird scored 19 points, while guard Jordan Daniels added 17 points and four assists for the Bulldogs (0-2). “Jordan settled down and made the extra pass and in turn he found himself getting open looks,” Drake coach Ray Giacoletti said. “He settled down and got into a nice rhythm. It comes back 10-fold if you make a nice pass to someone else.” In last Saturday’s 72-71 season-opening victory over Illinois-Chicago, the Blue Demons saw a 16-point halftime advantage vanish and needed Garrett’s game-winning 3-pointer to secure the win. “We wanted to close out the game,” DePaul coach Oliver Purnell said. “We didn’t want to let up like we did in the first game.” The Blue Demons shot 55.1 percent (27-of-49) from the field, including 9-of-20 (45 percent) on 3-point tries. After hitting just 32.1 percent in the opening half, the Bulldogs’ shooting improved and they closed with 23-of-54 (42.6 percent). DePaul outrebounded Drake 33-26. DePaul sprinted to an early 21-8 lead behind 4-of-8 shooting from beyond the arc, including a pair of 3-pointers from McDonald. Drake replied with a 14-7 surge — including back-to-back Caird 3-pointers — that cut the DePaul lead to 27-22. The Blue Demons went on an 11-3 run through the final 4:34 for a 38-25 halftime lead. Also Tuesday at Allstate Arena, the No. 18 DePaul women (3-1) beat in-state rival Bradley 101-77 as six Blue Demons hit double figures led by Brittany Hrynko’s 19 points. Fantasia Vine had 13 the Braves (0-2). “When you get it back to what we had in the second half, you have to be able to get stops,” Giacoletti said. “Those are things you have to be able to do collectively as a group and get stops. We’re undermanned right now without two seniors, and we’re trying to hold this together and get young guys better.” NOTES: Last week’s decision over Illinois-Chicago was DePaul’s seventh straight season-opening win. The Blue Demons are 81-11 all-time in the season’s first game. ... The Blue Demons are off for eight days for exams before hosting Lehigh in a Nov. 26 non-conference game. ... Drake, predicted to finish ninth in the Missouri Valley Conference, fell 77-58 in last Saturday’s season opener against Bowling Green. Freshmen impressed in that game as G Reed Timmer paced the Bulldogs with a team-high 16 points and G C.J. Rivers pulled down six rebounds. ... Drake’s Jacob Enevold Jensen played for the Nordic champion Danish national Under-20 team in 2014. ... Drake travels to Western Michigan on Saturday.",11192014,http://www.reuters.com/article/bkc-drake-depaul-writethru/no-suspense-in-depaul-win-this-time-idUSMTZEABJ9R5DE120141119

The business, which contributed 187 million euros of the group’s 2.3 billion euros in total sales last year, provides films for labels, tapes and hygiene products. Huhtamaki, which had been reviewing options for the films business as the group focuses on food packaging, said it expects to book a small capital gain as well as a reduction in goodwill of about 45 million euros upon closing the deal. The majority of the business will be held by DBAG Fund VI and its management, while Deutsche Beteiligungs will hold 17 percent of it, the German company said. Huhtamaki announced in July that it would buy India’s Positive Packaging for 247 million euros to increase its access to Indian and Middle Eastern markets. “Following the divestment and the Positive Packaging deal, Huhtamaki has about 300-400 million euros to spend on acquisitions. Most likely it will seek growth from developing markets,” said Inderes analyst Antti Viljakainen in a note to investors, adding that the deal’s selling price was in line with his estimates.

McDonald, a third-round pick in 2013, and free safety Rodney McLeod, an undrafted free agent in 2012. Said Williams of the duo, “They’re very good players. They do a great job with all of the adjustments. Our safeties have to be in sync with the middle linebacker. Then our safeties and the middle linebacker have to be an extension of me from the sideline in the communication process of all the multiple things that we do. They’re playing really good right now. Playing at a really high level and they’re able to make some nice plays that on interceptions, pass breakups and also some contact issues, legally the way they’re supposed to do it. They’re doing very well. I’m very pleased with them. They’re young and they’re only going to get better.” McDonald is third on the team with 93 tackles, while McLeod with 72. McDonald is second on the team with 66 solo stops. Fisher has said he thinks McDonald is playing at a Pro-Bowl level, and McDonald was asked by the Oakland media where he believes he and McLeod rank. “I think that you have to put us up there with the top,” McDonald said. “I think that right now, how we’re playing and what we’ve been doing - tackling well, doing things as far as showing different coverages and whatnot, confusing different offenses and being able to come down and make plays. It all comes down to making plays, and I feel like we’ve made plays. I think that we just have to keep putting those games together.” Williams also rates McDonald as Pro-Bowl caliber. “I think he is, I really do,” Williams said. “Really this last month he’s played better each and every week. We’re challenging him a lot behind the scenes. He’s accepting every challenge. Even in (a recent) practice, I don’t know if you guys watched him, a few things that I kind of attacked him on in the meetings that he brought out to the field and he did very well. I’ve been real pleased with how he’s playing. Got to continue to stay healthy, but he’s playing at an awful high level. While there were those that stereotyped McDonald as merely a box safety, Williams said, “I liked him coming out and I really believe that his cover skills are more than adequate. He can do an awful lot of things in a lot of different systems, a lot of different design of the coverages. Until you get a chance to go and be with him and see all the different things that he can do, I think we’ve just scratched the surface on some of the things that we can do with him. He’s a part of the game plan every week.” McDonald and McLeod have asserted themselves as leaders, along with middle linebacker James Laurinaitis. “You’ll see that leadership has no age,” Williams said. “Guys who are leaders on your team set an example that somebody else wants to be like them. I think you’re starting to see him be more vocal, too because the example of his play is now allowing him to speak more and he’s starting to say more and do more things behind the scenes from a leadership role that normal people want to say, ‘Well because a guy’s talking he must be a leader.’ Talking’s not leadership. Doing is leadership and then when you do say something maybe they’ll pay attention. He’s doing a good job with that.” SERIES HISTORY: 13th regular-season meeting. Raiders lead series, 8-4. The two teams have split four games since the Rams moved to St. Louis from Los Angeles in 1995, the same year the Raiders returned from L.A. to Oakland. In those last four, the Rams won the only game played in St. Louis in 2002. ———————————————————————- NFL Team Report - St. Louis Rams - NOTES, QUOTES —Wide receiver Stedman Bailey had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown against San Diego and is getting more involved in the offense. Bailey had a good conclusion to his 2013 season, but was then suspended for the first four games of this season. The suspension was reduced to two games when the league and NFLPA agreed to an adjusted drug policy in September. However, with Brian Quick and Kenny Britt playing well, Bailey didn’t get a lot of opportunities. He did this past Sunday. He was targeted nine times, and one of the receptions came on a fake punt that resulted in a first down. “I just know that this is a game of patience,” Bailey said. “Sometimes you’ve got to be patient. And whenever your number’s called, make sure you’re there to make the play.” Said head coach Jeff Fisher, “It’s just games and situations and opportunities. We’re settling in right now to a really good group. He’s been obviously doing really good things for us on special teams. But it’s (quarterback) Shaun (Hill) throwing the ball where the ball’s supposed to go. “You can see what he can do. He had really good run after catch and was very productive.” —Rams right tackle Joe Barksdale was originally a third-round pick of the Raiders in 2011, but was waived early the following season. He became a starter near the end of the 2012 season, and has been a mainstay at that spot the last two seasons. Head coach Jeff Fisher told the Oakland media, “Joe’s been really solid, really solid for us out there. He’s really fun to coach. He loves to practice and I’m just real proud of him. He’s worked very hard and I think each week he’s got a different challenge. He understands the difficulty in the matchups and he takes those challenges on. He knows he’s not going to win every time, but he’s a smart player and we were fortunate to be in the position to claim him.” —The Rams took a chance on wide receiver Kenny Britt in the offseason, and the gamble has worked out even if it was minimized by signing him to a one-year contract. Head coach Jeff Fisher was with the Titans when Britt was drafted, and believed in him. Now, it appears the Rams will try to re-sign him after the season. Said Fisher, “He’s been there every single day. He’s not missed a practice. He plays through things in the game. He’s doing a great job blocking for us. He’s got big-play potential and it showed last week. He’s really having fun. I think he’s got a lot of football left in him.” Asked about Britt’s maturation off the field, “I’ve said this many times: It was wrong place at the wrong time. A lot of things were taken out of context. Has a big heart, loves the game, is a great teammate, he’s always been that. I think he understands things are different now and you’ve got to be aware of your surroundings and all that. He is 110 percent into football right now and that’s great.” —Defensive end Chris Long, currently on reserve/injured, designated for return, began his third week of practice and is getting close to being activated. Long began practicing on Nov. 12, so the 21-day period expires next Tuesday. After practice Wednesday, Fisher said, “He’s coming on. He did a little more today.” As for what long can mean to the defense when he returns and is able to play at a hogh level, Fisher said, “We’ve missed him. We’ve missed his production. We’ve missed the consistent year after year sack production and his ability to play the run. When he comes back it should help us improve in those areas.” When asked if Long has begin lobbying to be activated, Fisher said, “Yes, it’s already started.” BY THE NUMBERS: 50-27 - Combined record of the seven teams the Rams have lost to this season. The Vikings (4-7) are the only team with a losing record. The other six have a combined record of 46-20. QUOTES TO NOTE: “We discussed it this morning. It’s just such a difficult situation. We had an opportunity to get involved in August with the three football teams and the organization has done some other things. Hopefully, as soon as things settle down then we’ll get back involved. As we talked as a group it’s our community, it’s their neighbors. Everybody cares deeply about what’s going on and hopes things can get settled as soon as possible.” - Coach Jeff Fisher on whether the team talks about the situation in Ferguson, Mo. ———————————————————————- NFL Team Report - St. Louis Rams - STRATEGY AND PERSONNEL —G Davin Joseph (not injury related) was added to the practice report Thursday when he did not practice. —LB Alec Ogletree (illness) was added to the practice report Thursday when he was limited in practice. —LB Will Herring (foot), who did not practice Wednesday was limited on Thursday. —CB Marcus Roberson (ankle), who has been inactive the last three games, continues to be sidelined and did not practice Wednesday or Thursday. —WR Kenny Britt (back), who did not practice Wednesday, participated fully on Thursday. —CB E.J. Gaines (knee), who did not practice Wednesday, participated fully on Thursday. —LB James Laurinaitis (ankle), who did not practice Wednesday, participated fully on Thursday. —DE Robert Quinn (not injury related), who did not practice Wednesday, participated fully on Thursday. —C Scott Wells (not injury related), who did not practice Wednesday, participated fully on Thursday. —DE Eugene Sims (not injury related) did not practice Wednesday and Thursday. —TE Cory Harkey (thigh) was limited in practice Wednesday and Thursday. —TE Jared Cook (back), who was limited in practice Wednesday, participated fully on Thursday. —DT Alex Carrington (thigh), who has been inactive for the last two games, was limited in practice Wednesday and Thursday. —DB Lamarcus Joyner (groin), who has been inactive for the last two games, participated fully in practice Wednesday and Thursday. GAME PLAN: The Rams will look to run the ball against the Raiders and set up play-action for throws downfield to WRs Kenny Britt and Stedman Bailey. On defense, they hope to get pressure on QB Derek Carr by stopping the run and putting the Raiders in long-yardage situations. —Rams DRE Robert Quinn vs. Raiders LT Donald Penn. Oakland QB Derek Carr has been sacked just 12 times, and much of that is because he gets rid of the ball quickly and throws numerous short passes. His completions have averaged a mere 9.4 yards. Penn will work to keep the explosive Quinn away. —Rams RB Tre Mason vs. Raiders LBs Kahlil Mack, Sio Moore and Miles Burris. The Raiders have allowed a large number of rushing yards, thanks largely to opponents running the ball with leads. However, they have allowed just 3.8 yards per run. The Rams will try to establish the run with Mason, but it could be tough against Oakland’s active linebackers. Burris is seco0nd on the team with 106 tackles, Moore third with 97 and Mack fourth with 64.",11292014,http://www.reuters.com/article/fbn-rams-teamreport/st-louis-rams-teamreport-idUSMTZEABTSEYAKH20141129
623,MCD,McDonald's warns that weak sales will hit fourth-quarter profit,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) on Monday reported a steeper-than-expected drop in global sales at established restaurants for November, hurt by weakness in the United States and Asia, and warned that such declines would “significantly pressure” margins this quarter. November marked the sixth straight month of worldwide same-restaurant sales declines at McDonald’s, which is battling changing consumer tastes, tough U.S. competition, the after-effects of a supplier scandal in Asia and economic and political turmoil in Europe. Worldwide sales at restaurants open at least 13 months were down 2.2 percent last month, more than the 1.7 percent decline analysts expected, according to Consensus Metrix. Shares in McDonald’s fell 3.8 percent to $92.69 in afternoon trading. Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson, who took the helm in July 2012, has shaken up management and is giving more power to local operators in a bid to improve results. Despite that, U.S. sales at restaurants open at least 13 months tumbled 4.6 percent in November, the biggest monthly decline since June 2001. Analysts, on average, expected a 1.9 percent fall.   McDonald’s U.S. same-restaurant sales have not increased since October 2013, in part due to competition from smaller and more nimble direct rivals ranging from Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N to In-N-Out Burger and Chick-fil-A.  It is localizing U.S. menus and focusing on customization and fresh ingredients as it also seeks to better compete with popular chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) and Subway, where diners pick the ingredients that go into their meals. The stronger U.S. dollar also is expected to reduce fourth-quarter profit by as much as 9 cents per share, McDonald’s said on Monday. November same-restaurant sales fell 4 percent in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA), which has not yet recovered from a China meat supplier scandal that drove away diners and sent restaurants scrambling for new sources of ingredients for its Chicken McNuggets and Big Macs.  The company said the weak APMEA results could cut McDonald’s profits by as much as 10 cents a share in the current quarter that ends on Dec. 31. Europe’s same-restaurant sales were down 2 percent in November, hurt by “very weak” results from Russia as well as declines in France and Germany.  McDonald’s said on Monday that all restaurants closed for as long as three months by Russian officials had been reopened.

624,MCD,US STOCKS-S&P; 500 posts worst day since Oct; energy shares sink,"* Energy shares fall 3.9 pct on latest crude price tumble * Japan, China data disappoints * McDonald’s falls after November sales * Indexes: Dow off 0.6 pct, S&P; 0.7 pct, Nasdaq down 0.8 pct   (Updates to close) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 posted its biggest daily percentage drop since Oct. 22 on Monday as oil’s slump to a five-year low caused a selloff in energy shares. Worries about global growth added to the bearish tone. Data showed China’s exports grew at a slower-than-expected pace and imports dropped in November, while Japan’s economy shrank more than expected in the third quarter. The S&P; energy index tumbled 3.9 percent and traded at its lowest since June 2013 as Brent crude fell to a five-year low on predictions oversupply would keep building until next year. Leading the decline, shares of Exxon Mobil  fell 2.3 percent to $91.70 while shares of Chevron  dropped 3.7 percent to $106.80. The energy index is now down 12.8 percent for the year and is the only major S&P; sectors in negative territory for 2014.  The S&P; 500 is up 11.5 percent for the year so far. Most growth-oriented sectors also fell, suggesting investors were avoiding riskier areas of the market. Meanwhile several of the year’s biggest gainers also sold off, possibly due to year-end profit-taking, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. Among them, Apple was down 2.3 percent at $112.40, while GoPro shares fell 6.3 percent at $67.65. “This has been a monster market, and it’s been eking out new records. So it’s taking a breather. The question is, is the U.S. equities versus other asset classes trade done,” said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 106.31 points, or 0.59 percent, to 17,852.48, the S&P; 500 lost 15.06 points, or 0.73 percent, to 2,060.31 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 40.06 points, or 0.84 percent, to 4,740.69. The tumble follows gains Friday, which had pushed the S&P; 500 to a record high close for the 49th time this year. Volume picked up after midday, while the S&P; 500 moved more than 21 points from its high for the day to its low, its largest high-to-low swing in more than a month. On the New York Stock Exchange, 71 more stocks made 52-week lows compared with those making new highs, the largest gap skewed in favor of new lows since Oct. 16, the day after the market made its bottom in the recent pullback. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,180 to 919, for a 2.37-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 2,048 issues fell and 699 advanced for a 2.93-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. McDonald’s shares shed 3.8 percent to $92.61 after the fast-food restaurant chain reported a steeper-than-expected fall in global same-restaurant sales in November and said fourth-quarter results would be hurt by a supplier scandal in China and a stronger dollar. About 7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.6 billion average for the month to date, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

Energy was easily the worst-performing S&P; sector, down 3.6 percent, as Brent crude fell to a five-year low on predictions oversupply would keep building until next year.

633,MCD,"McDonald's to pare U.S. menus, ingredient lists","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp said on Wednesday it plans to cut the number of items on its U.S. menus and use fewer ingredients in food as it moves to speed up service, bolster sales and offer consumers personalized options to compete better with Subway and Chipotle Mexican Grill. Mike Andres, the company’s U.S. president, said starting in January menus will have eight fewer food items and five fewer Extra Value Meals.  The world’s biggest fast-food chain, which has not had a monthly gain in sales at established U.S. restaurants since October 2013, is also making the changes to reach out to consumers who are demanding simpler, more natural food choices. The company is testing its slimmed-down menus in six markets, including Bakersfield, California, and Knoxville, Tennessee, a spokeswoman said. The simplified menu boards will offer one Quarter Pounder with Cheese hamburger as compared with four on the regular menu, one Premium Chicken sandwich versus three, and one Snack Wrap versus three. Andres said McDonald’s is not finished tweaking menus. “There’s more to come,” Andres said on a conference call with investors. “We don’t need to have a big menu board to offer variety.”  The menu changes come as McDonald’s plans to roll out its new “Create Your Taste” sandwich program to 2,000 of its 14,000-plus U.S. restaurants by the end of 2015.  McDonald’s is hoping that giving customers a choice of sandwich toppings will enable it to better compete with Subway and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, popular restaurants that allow diners to build their meals ingredient-by-ingredient. McDonald’s abandoned a prior customization drive several years ago. Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson recently told Reuters that technology that allows customers to order from mobile phones and in-restaurant kiosks makes success more likely this time around. In addition, the company with the “golden arches” has been working to win back mothers and young diners, who increasingly want food that is fresh and minimally processed. In October, it launched a U.S. online campaign called “Our food. Your questions.” aimed at addressing negative perceptions about its food quality. Andres said McDonald’s ingredient labels need to be shorter and noted that simplifying ingredients is an enormous task, “but we have to get started,” offering a glimpse into how the company is rethinking its recipes.

636,MCD,Preview: Columbia at Kentucky,"When it comes to No. 1 Kentucky and its roster loaded with former McDonald’s All-Americans, the only question is which one of their stars will dominate on a nightly basis. On Sunday, it was Karl-Anthony Towns, who scored a career-high 19 points while adding nine rebounds and four blocks in a lopsided win over Eastern Kentucky. The freshman forward looks to score in double figures for the fifth straight game Wednesday when the Wildcats host Columbia. Kentucky needs to make sure it focuses on the Lions despite games looming against North Carolina, UCLA and Louisville later this month. Columbia likely will have its hands full with the Wildcats’ length, as their average height (6 feet, 10.14 inches) is taller than every NBA team except the Portland Trail Blazers. The Lions are coming off perhaps their best game of the season - a 23-point victory against Bucknell on Saturday. TV: 7 p.m. ET, ESPN2 ABOUT COLUMBIA (5-2): The Lions are not a particularly good shooting team in any respect, although Maodo Lo has knocked down a team-high 16 3-pointers en route to a team-leading 16.1 scoring average. He scored 20 points on 4-of-6 3-point shooting against Bucknell as the Lions connected on 10-of-22 3-pointers as a team. Cory Osetkowski also had a big game against the Bison, posting 12 points, 12 rebounds, six assists and three blocks. ABOUT KENTUCKY (9-0): The key to the Wildcats’ success - besides the overwhelming talent on their roster - has been a defense that has given up more than 52 points only once in nine games. They held Eastern Kentucky to 14 first-half points and 26.1 percent shooting overall while outrebounding the Colonels by 20. “It shows that we are focused after a big win against Texas,” said another one of the Wildcats’ star freshmen, Trey Lyles, who had 10 points and 10 rebounds for his first career double-double. “We can come out and keep our mindset, which is winning.” TIP-INS 1. Lo has 20 steals this season - one more than all of his teammates combined. 2. Kentucky PG Andrew Harrison, who had not committed more than two turnovers in any of the Wildcats’ first eight games, committed five miscues on Sunday. 3. Wildcats C Willie Cauley-Stein has scored in double figures in three straight games and has shot at least 50 percent from floor in eight of the nine games this year.

637,MCD,Yum Brands cuts profit forecast again on slow China recovery,"(Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) lowered its profit forecast for the year for the second time, hurt by slower-than-expected sales recovery in China following a food safety scare in July. Shares of the company, which operates Pizza Hut and KFC restaurant chains, fell 6.5 percent in extended trading. The company said it expects full-year profit growth to be in “mid-single-digit” percentage.  It had earlier cut the forecast to 6-10 percent from at least 20 percent.  A television report early July showing improper meat handling by supplier Shanghai Husi Food scared away customers in China, Yum’s biggest market by sales. U.S.-based fast-food chains McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Burger King Worldwide Inc BKW.N and coffee chain Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) also landed into controversy as they procured meat from Shanghai Husi.  Food safety is a highly emotive issue in China where there have been numerous scandals from photos of food oil being scooped from drains to tales of phoney eggs and melamine-tainted milk powder. Yum said on Tuesday it expects 2015 profit to grow by at least 10 percent, while expecting operating profit in the China division to grow by at least 15 percent. The company’s shares closed at $75.22 on Tuesday, on the New York Stock Exchange.

638,MCD,U.S. NLRB files labor violations complaints against McDonald's,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp and some of its franchisees were named jointly in complaints filed on Friday by the U.S. National Labor Relations Board’s Office of the General Counsel, accusing them of labor violations in a widely anticipated move that could have wide-reaching implications for businesses. Complaints were filed in 78 cases claiming that McDonald’s workers across the country were fired or intimidated for participating in union organizing and in a national protest movement calling for higher wages. The complaints strike new ground in treating McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, as a “joint employer,” meaning that it could be held liable along with its franchisees for any violations, the NLRB’s general counsel, Richard Griffin, said in a release. Until now, McDonald’s and other companies that make wide use of franchises and contract employers have been insulated from such liability under the NLRB’s previous definition of what constituted a joint employer. A McDonald’s spokeswoman said the company and franchisees would fight the claims. “These allegations are driven in large part by a two-year, union-financed campaign that has targeted the McDonald’s brand and impacted McDonald’s restaurants,” said Lisa McComb, a company spokeswoman. The complaints will be considered by administrative law judges beginning in March 2015; the decisions can be appealed to the five-member NLRB and ultimately to federal courts. While Friday’s move was the first step in a long process, it has the potential to rewrite long-held rules governing labor relations between parent companies and franchises that are run as independent businesses. For the last three decades, the NLRB has held that franchisers may only be considered joint employers if they are involved in setting wages and hiring workers. Mary Joyce Carlson, counsel for the Fast Food Workers Organizing Committee, the union-backed group behind the protest movement, said Griffin was right to treat McDonald’s as a joint employer because of the control it exerts over franchises, including the way food is prepared and served. Trade groups said the decision to treat McDonald’s as a joint employer would lead to uncertainty about how employment agreements are enforced and when companies can be sued for labor violations. “This is chaos,” said Michael Lotito, a lawyer with law firm Littler Mendelson who represents companies in labor disputes. The real losers could be the franchisees if companies decide to abandon the franchise model, said Robert Cresanti, vice president of the International Franchise Association, whose membership includes McDonald’s. The franchise association says 8.5 million U.S. workers are employed by franchises. Griffin, in a separate case in June, asked the NLRB to adopt a broader standard on joint employers that reflects the influence companies like McDonald’s have over working conditions, such as requiring the use of scheduling software. The board is set to decide in that case whether it will begin to apply the broader standard, which would impact industries far beyond fast food.",12192014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-employment-mcdonalds/u-s-nlrb-files-labor-violations-complaints-against-mcdonalds-idUSL1N0U31Q220141219

642,MCD,McDonald's fries back on the menu in all sizes in Japan,"TOKYO, Dec 26 (Reuters) - McDonald’s customers in Japan will be able to order french fries in all sizes again from next month, after the fast-food chain limited sales to small servings because of import delays. McDonald’s Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd said on Friday it will resume sales of medium- and large-size french fries on Jan. 5, as it has secured enough inventory thanks to emergency measures. The company, owned 49.9 percent by McDonald’s Corp, began restricting serving sizes on Dec. 17 after a labour dispute at U.S. West Coast ports led to delays in imports. As an emergency step, McDonald’s Japan said earlier this month that it was importing over 1,000 tonnes of frozen fries by air, and another 1,600 tonnes by ship from ports on the U.S. East Coast. The fry rationing capped off a tough year for McDonald’s Japan: the company in October forecast its first annual loss in 11 years as sales slid following a food safety scandal at the Chinese supplier of chicken for its McNuggets. Sales at outlets open at least a year fell 12 percent in November, down for the 10th month in a row. McDonald’s Japan said it continues to face import delays as the port labour dispute drags on. It said it will monitor the situation closely and do its best to offer a stable supply of fries. A company spokesman declined to comment on the fry shortage’s impact on earnings.

643,MCD,CORRECTED-Subway investigates China media reports of doctored expiry dates,"(Corrects Reuters Instrument Code for McDonald’s in paragraph five) SHANGHAI, Dec 29 (Reuters) - U.S. fast-food chain Subway is investigating media reports in China that workers at an outlet in Beijing doctored food labels and used produce beyond its expiry date, a Shanghai-based spokeswoman for the firm said on Monday. Chinese media reports that started circulating on Friday said workers at a Beijing outlet for Subway, which operates globally as a franchise business, changed expiry and production dates on meat, drink and vegetable produce to extend their use. “Our headquarters here is now investigating the matter,” a Subway spokeswoman said. She said the firm had not reached any conclusions. “We want to investigate what caused the labelling issue and whether or not it was the action of a single franchised outlet.” The issue highlights the difficulty firms have to control food quality and safety in supply chains and outlets in China, which can cause serious headaches with regulators and hit sales. Earlier this year, a China-based food supplier to McDonald’s Corp and Yum Brands Inc was caught up in a scandal over workers allegedly tampering with expiry dates, which pummelled China sales at the fast-food chains. The Subway spokeswoman said the firm sent teams to inspect its franchises around the country each month and that it gave staff training on food safety and handling produce. The Beijing food regulator had also launched an investigation, she added. Food safety scandals in China are all too common, including recycled “gutter oil” for cooking, donkey meat products tainted with fox and one in 2008 involving tainted dairy products that led to the deaths of at least six infants. Subway, part of Doctor’s Associate Inc, has close to 500 outlets in China, according to its official website.

644,MCD,Venezuelans not 'lovin' it' as McDonald's fries go scarce,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan fast-food lovers are mourning the disappearance of McDonald’s golden staple: the french fry. A recent shortage at the U.S. fast food chain comes as socialist Venezuela grapples with shortfalls of basic goods ranging from medicines to flour due to strict currency controls that stymie imports.  McDonald’s restaurants are coping by replacing the spuds with salad or local fare such as fried yuca or “arepa” corn pancakes - but Golden Arches fans are none too happy about the new meal. “Hamburgers don’t go with arepas and this salad I accepted doesn’t taste of anything,” moaned student Indira Silva, 27, at a fast-food outlet in affluent eastern Caracas.  “I’m not coming back until the fries do.” Two cashiers at separate restaurants said fries had been missing for two weeks and that business had dropped as a result. One said french fry imports had ground to a halt for lack of hard currency. Arcos Dorados S.A., McDonald’s Corp’s key operator in Latin America, did not reply to queries about whether Venezuela’s Byzantine three-tiered exchange rate system was to blame.  “There is currently a temporary issue with distribution, which we are trying to resolve,” said Sonia Ruseler, senior director for corporate communications at Arcos Dorados. A protracted labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports forced McDonald’s to ration fries in Japan last year.

645,MCD,Venezuelans not 'lovin' it' as McDonald's fries go scarce,"CARACAS, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Venezuelan fast-food lovers are mourning the disappearance of McDonald’s golden staple: the french fry. A recent shortage at the U.S. fast food chain comes as socialist Venezuela grapples with shortfalls of basic goods ranging from medicines to flour due to strict currency controls that stymie imports. McDonald’s restaurants are coping by replacing the spuds with salad or local fare such as fried yuca or “arepa” corn pancakes - but Golden Arches fans are none too happy about the new meal. “Hamburgers don’t go with arepas and this salad I accepted doesn’t taste of anything,” moaned student Indira Silva, 27, at a fast-food outlet in affluent eastern Caracas. “I’m not coming back until the fries do.” Two cashiers at separate restaurants said fries had been missing for two weeks and that business had dropped as a result. One said french fry imports had ground to a halt for lack of hard currency. Arcos Dorados S.A., McDonald’s Corp’s key operator in Latin America, did not reply to queries about whether Venezuela’s Byzantine three-tiered exchange rate system was to blame. “There is currently a temporary issue with distribution, which we are trying to resolve,” said Sonia Ruseler, senior director for corporate communications at Arcos Dorados. A protracted labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports forced McDonald’s to ration fries in Japan last year.

646,MCD,"McDonald's Japan apologizes after tooth, plastic found in food","TOKYO (Reuters) - McDonald’s Japan (2702.T) has apologized to customers and vowed to ensure product safety after objects including a tooth and plastic were found in its food, the latest trouble for a fast-food chain hit by sliding sales and a shortage of french fries. The chain, 49.9 percent-owned by McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), has been grappling with falling sales that began long before a food safety scandal last summer hit confidence in its products. Convenience stores in particular have drawn away customers with broader ranges of ready-made meals and low-priced coffee. McDonald’s Japan brought in Chief Executive Sarah Casanova last March to reverse the trend, but the company is still on track to record its sixth straight year of sales declines and its first annual loss in 11 years. Wednesday’s apology came after a diner found a roughly 4 cm (1 1/2 inch) strip of vinyl in a Chicken McNugget at the weekend. That prompted the chain to halt sales of nuggets made on the same day as the contaminated item at a plant in Thailand. The company is still investigating the cause. Among other incidents, a human tooth was found in a customer’s french fry in August, while a child in December cut his mouth on a piece of plastic that was in a chocolate sundae. At a packed news conference, executives sought to reassure the public of the safety of McDonald’s food. “I am confident that my family can eat McDonald’s products,” said Takehiko Aoki, senior vice president at McDonald’s Holding Co (Japan) Ltd. “I think our response has been appropriate,” he said when questioned on whether the company had been slow to announce its findings, explaining that the handling of each case is different. McDonald’s Japan only started sourcing nuggets from three Thai plants less than six months ago. The change was aimed at boosting confidence in product quality after Chinese supplier Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd was accused of selling expired meat. The Thai plant that produced the nugget found to contain vinyl is located in Saraburi, owned by Cargill, McDonald’s Japan said. Cargill Thailand was not immediately available for comment. On Monday, just days after the latest discovery, McDonald’s Japan resumed sales of all sizes of french fries for the first time in three weeks. A labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports had delayed imports, forcing the company to ration portions. McDonald's Japan shares closed down 0.9 percent on Wednesday versus a 0.3 percent rise in the Jasdaq index .JSD.

647,MCD,U.S. supplier in China food scare takes aim at Shanghai regulator,"SHANGHAI, Jan 7 (Reuters) - U.S. food supplier OSI Group LLC, which came under fire in China last year over allegations it used out-of-date meat, has criticised the handling of the case by the local food regulator, a rare act in China where firms are usually careful not to openly challenge the authorities. OSI’s Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd plant came under the spotlight in July when an undercover Chinese media report showed workers using out-of-date meat and doctoring production dates. The firm, which supplied international fast food chains including McDonald’s Corp and Yum Brands Inc, launched a sweeping recall last summer that culminated on Sunday when it said it had destroyed the products. The Shanghai Food and Drug Administration, which is still investigating Shanghai Husi over the matter, called the food destroyed on Sunday “questionable” in a routine statement, prompting the strong objections from OSI. “Without having any test results or even having done any testing on the relevant products, and with the case still under investigation, to define the products our company has voluntarily recalled as “questionable” ... is totally without factual, scientific or legal foundation,” Shanghai Husi said in a statement in Chinese on the OSI China website. The statement said Chinese rules defined “questionable” food products as those which did not meet food safety standards or could be harmful for human health. OSI’s criticism escalated a rare war of words between a foreign company and Chinese regulators, who over the past year have closely scrutinized international firms in industries ranging from automobiles to high tech. Microsoft Corp, for instance, has expressed deference to Chinese anti-monopoly regulators looking into its software sales practices — even while U.S. business lobbies have complained about their companies being unfairly targeted. OSI’s tussle with its Shanghai regulator also comes at a time when the central government in Beijing has acknowledged China’s struggles to regulate tainted products. China’s top food watchdog said on Wednesday food and drug safety in the country was “grim” and pledged stronger oversight in the wake of a string of food scandals which have hit the reputations of brands including McDonald’s, Yum and retailers Carrefour SA and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The Shanghai Husi scandal, which spread as far as Hong Kong and Japan, sparked a Chinese probe into the firm and dragged down Chinese sales at KFC-parent Yum and McDonald’s. Both have since cut or suspended ties with Aurora, Illinois-based OSI.

648,MCD,"China regulator to strengthen 'grim' food, drug safety control","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Food and drug safety in China is “grim” and will get stronger oversight, the food and drug regulator said on Wednesday, after a series of scares last year hit the reputations of global firms such as McDonald’s Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The China Food and Drug Administration has struggled to control a string of high-profile scandals over the years, from donkey meat products tainted with fox, heavy metals in baby food and allegations of expired meat sold to fast-food chains. “We must soberly recognize the current foundations of China’s food and drug safety are still weak, with new and old risks together creating a grim situation,” the regulator said in a statement on its website after a meeting in Beijing this week. Safety scares have affected the reputations and China sales of global companies from U.S. fast-food chains McDonald’s and Yum Brands Inc to retailers such as Wal-Mart and France’s Carrefour SA. China will increase “active” regulation to prevent food and drug safety scares, with more on-site inspections, random tests and unannounced visits, the regulator said. The quality of personnel, legal structures, management methods and technological aspects were all currently insufficient, it said. Regulators overseeing the country’s food industry are thinly stretched, company executives told Reuters, and inspectors often struggle to deal with China’s fragmented food supply chains. The regulator said China would look to attract more personnel, standardize training methods and promote greater cooperation between regions. The government has struggled to restore confidence in its $1 trillion food processing industry since six infants died in 2008 after drinking adulterated milk, creating a space for imported goods which are often seen as safer and of higher quality.

652,MCD,Former McDonald's workers in Virginia file civil rights lawsuit,"(Reuters) - Former McDonald’s Corp workers in Virginia filed a civil rights lawsuit Thursday against the world’s largest fast-food chain and owner of restaurants where they worked in the latest bid to hold it legally responsible for the actions of its franchisees. Nine African-American and one Hispanic worker claimed they were subjected to “rampant racial and sexual harassment” by supervisors at three restaurants run by McDonald’s franchisee Michael Simon, who operates as Soweva Co.  The workers also alleged wrongful termination in the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Virginia. Soweva began operating the restaurants at the end of 2013. Among other claims, the workers said Soweva supervisors told the mostly African-American staff it was “too dark” in the restaurants, and that it was necessary to replace employees to “get the ghetto out of the store.” Plaintiff Katrina Stanfield, speaking on a conference call with reporters, said one supervisor touched workers inappropriately and sent them naked photos of himself. When she complained about the discrimination and dismissals to McDonald’s corporate office, Stanfield said she received no response. “I still don’t understand why McDonald’s did nothing,” Stanfield said. A worker in one of Simon’s restaurants referred Reuters to McDonald’s Corp, which declined to comment on the allegations and said it would review the matter.  “McDonald’s has a long-standing history of embracing the diversity ... and discrimination is completely inconsistent with our values,” the company said in a statement. The lawsuit alleged that McDonald’s has control over nearly every aspect of its franchised restaurants’ operations, including hiring, firing, wage-setting, scheduling, training and discipline.  Paul Smith, an associate at Patterson Harkavy LLP who represents the workers, said courts look to the degree of control over franchisee operations when determining if a franchisor is a joint employer.  About a month ago, the general counsel of the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filed a complaint against McDonald’s Corp, which could hold it liable for violations by its franchisees. Restaurant workers from across the country claimed they were fired or intimidated for participating in union activities or in protests for higher wages. The outcome of those cases could affect a wide swath of industries, including hotel chains, manufacturers and construction firms.

656,MCD,McDonald's says rough ride to continue into 2015,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) warned on Friday that business will be weak in the first half of 2015 and it is cutting its annual construction budget to the lowest in more than five years as it opens fewer restaurants in struggling markets. The world’s largest fast-food chain, with more than 36,000 restaurants around the globe, just finished one of its toughest years in decades.  It struggled to recover from a food scare in China that battered Asian sales and wrestled with economic weakness and political upheaval in Europe, its top revenue market. The company also lost market share to rivals in the United States, where its image has been dented by frequent protests from workers seeking higher wages. Sales at established restaurants, a closely watched gauge of performance also known as comparable sales, fell during the fourth quarter and for all of 2014. Revenue and net income suffered the same fates. Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson, who took the helm in July 2012 and is under pressure to turn the business around, said he expected the trend to continue as McDonald’s works to make the business to be more nimble and responsive to customers.  “January comparable sales are expected to be negative and results are expected to remain pressured, particularly in the first half of the year,” Thompson said in a statement. The company, trying to find the right recipe for diners’ growing appetite for healthier and fresher food, is trimming complicated menus, giving more control back to restaurant operators and testing customized burgers and sandwiches to compete with popular restaurants like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) and Subway. Fourth-quarter net income dropped 21 percent to $1.1 billion, or $1.13 per share, while revenue fell more than 7 percent to $6.57 billion. Global sales at established restaurants were down 0.9 percent. U.S. comparable sales in December offered a glimmer of hope, rising 0.4 percent and marking the first increase since October 2013. McDonald’s set a 2015 capital spending target of around $2 billion, down from about $2.7 billion last year.   Company shares, which have underperformed rivals, the Dow .DJI and the S&P; 500 .SPX, dipped 0.4 percent to $90.62.

Thursday’s advance came after the European Central Bank detailed a bond-buying program to boost the region’s sagging economy and fight deflation. The program was larger than expected and will last through September 2016. The rally took the S&P; 500 above its 50-day moving average, a metric of near-term momentum that the benchmark index hasn’t closed above since Jan. 8. With the ECB stimulus details known, U.S. corporate earnings will likely be the primary driver of trading over the next few weeks. With 15 percent of S&P; 500 companies having reported, 73.7 percent have topped earnings expectations while 53.9 percent have beaten on revenue, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with the long-term average of 63 percent for earnings and 61 percent for revenue. General Electric Co posted a rise in fourth-quarter earnings, boosted by its power-generating turbines and jet engines divisions, though sales fell in its oil and gas unit.  Shares of the Dow component rose 0.3 percent to $24.36 before the bell. McDonald’s Corp fell 0.7 percent to $90.23 in premarket trading after the fast food giant reported a drop in fourth-quarter revenue and said it expected its January comparable sales to be negative. Starbucks Corp rose 4.8 percent to $86.70 in premarket trading a day after the coffee chain reported same-store sales growth that was better than expected in its Americas region. Crude oil prices will continue to be in focus, with additional uncertainty coming in the wake of the death of Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah. While the country’s oil policies are expected to be unchanged, the commodity has been extremely volatile of late, with its value dropping by more than half over the past six months. Oil fell 0.5 percent on Friday, reversing earlier gains, and was on track for its 15th negative week out of the past 17. While the drop in crude prices is seen pressuring the profits of energy shares this quarter, it could lift stocks in the transportation, retail and industrial sectors. For the week, the Dow is up 1.7 percent, the S&P; 500 is up 2.2 percent and the Nasdaq is up 2.5 percent. All three are coming off three straight negative weeks. Futures snapshot at 7:57 a.m.: * S&P; 500 e-minis were up 4 points, or 0.19 percent, with 138,136 contracts changing hands. * Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 5.75 points, or 0.13 percent, in volume of 21,966 contracts. * Dow e-minis were up 38 points, or 0.21 percent, with 21,567 contracts changing hands.

665,MCD,Fitch Solutions: CEO Exit Could Aid McDonald's Much Wider CDS,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 29 (Fitch) Trending much wider since last year, credit default  swap (CDS) spreads for McDonald’s Corporation could actually reverse course in  light of some surprising news today, according to Fitch Solutions in its latest  CDS Case Study Snapshot. Five-year CDS on McDonald’s have been trending wider since September 2014 and  are now 142% wider compared levels seen this time last year.  After pricing  historically in-line with ‘AAA’ levels, the cost of credit protection on  McDonald’s debt is now pricing in ‘A+’ space. ‘Growing market concerns over  McDonald’s credit prospects are likely attributed to the company’s sluggish  sales and profitability,’ said Director Diana Allmendinger.   That said, McDonald’s CDS have tightened modestly over the past week ahead of  today’s announcement that their Chief Executive Officer is stepping down and  being replaced by the Chief Branding Officer.  ‘Today’s news could potentially  be perceived by the market as a positive step towards modifying McDonald’s  strategy,’ said Allmendinger.  Fitch Solutions case studies build on data from its CDS Pricing Service and  proprietary quantitative models, including CDS Implied Ratings. These credit  risk indicators are designed to provide real-time, market-based views of  creditworthiness. As such, they can and often do reflect more short term market  views on factors such as currencies, seasonal market effects and short-term  technical influences. This is in contrast to Fitch Ratings’ Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs), which are based on forward-looking fundamental credit analysis  over an extended period of time.

666,MCD,McDonald's CEO Don Thompson leaving after tumultuous run,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), fresh off one of its worst financial years in decades, on Wednesday said Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson would leave at the end of February and be succeeded by Chief Brand Officer Steve Easterbrook. Shares in the world’s biggest fast-food chain, which have been underperforming major markets and several peers, jumped 3.2 percent in extended trading following the news. Thompson, the 51-year-old former president of McDonald’s USA who took the global helm in July 2012, had the challenge of adding to nearly nine years of sales gains at established restaurants. But the following September, McDonald’s reported a decline in same-store sales as it fought to hold on to customers with changing tastes amid external pressures ranging from political and economic turmoil in Europe to food safety scares in China.  “I don’t think it was too much of a surprise. Maybe in the timing but not the action,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said. “This has been something that people have been talking about for a while.” McDonald’s warned last week that business would be weak in the first half of 2015 and said it would cut its annual construction budget to the lowest in more than five years as it opens fewer restaurants in struggling markets. In his role as chief brand officer, Easterbrook led McDonald’s digital initiatives and efforts to boost menu innovation, according to a statement from the company. Industry watchers also said his track record includes turning around the company’s business in the United Kingdom.  According to a 2008 story in the Guardian, that business was stalling in the early 2000s, but it had a strong run under Easterbrook, who took over as CEO in 2006 and refocused on the core business of selling hamburgers.    “The UK has been a good market for them for a long time, but it wasn’t always,” Senatore said. “He played a role in the turnaround.” The question is can he turn around the company’s brand, particularly in the United States where it is losing share to rivals such as Five Guys Burgers and Fries, Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) and other smaller, regional food outlets which are seen as offering fresher and higher quality products. Easterbrook has experience leading other restaurant chains. In 2011, he left McDonald’s and ran two UK-based restaurant chains, PizzaExpress LTD, a British chain which markets itself on quality and freshness, and later, Wagamama Ltd, a pan-Asian restaurant chain modeled on Japanese ramen bars. He returned to McDonald’s in 2013. Christopher Rowane, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, which owns roughly a million shares of McDonald’s, said Easterbrook is a logical choice for the job. “I think that it’s very fitting that they’ve selected the chief brand officer,” he said. “This is really where we’re seeing a little bit of a vacancy in McDonald’s. They’re trying to really find their brand to be able to drive same store sales growth.” ",1292015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-ceo/mcdonalds-ceo-don-thompson-leaving-after-tumultuous-run-idUSKBN0L12PS20150129

669,MCD,"McDonald's franchisees to new CEO: back-to-basics, fast","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) franchisees have an urgent order for the fast-food giant’s new CEO - get back-to-basics. In interviews, franchisees and advisors to restaurant owners say they hope the new chief will shrink its huge menu to concentrate on burgers and fries.  McDonald’s on Wednesday said Chief Brand Officer Steve Easterbrook would replace Don Thompson as chief executive after he had held the post just two and a half years.  Easterbrook, 47, turned around McDonald’s operations in the UK, where he was born, by refocusing on burgers and burnishing the brand with an ad campaign that sought to debunk unflattering rumors about its food, the company said.  A cricket enthusiast who earned a reputation among former UK colleagues for being funny, fair and a lover of simplicity, Easterbrook will also be the rare McDonald’s CEO with experience running other restaurant chains.    “I will be very curious to see if this new guy continues on with what Thompson has been doing ... or if he will put some new ideas in. I’m very hopeful,” said Kathryn Slater-Carter, who operates one of McDonald’s restaurants in Daly City, California. She declined to elaborate. The world’s largest restaurant chain by sales has more than 36,000 restaurants around the globe. Revenue, net income and traffic all fell in 2014, as it struggled to appeal to younger and more upscale diners who demand fresher, healthier fare. During the last few years, McDonald’s has expanded menus to broaden appeal. While that effort initially boosted sales, franchisees now blame sprawling menus for slowing service and are calling on the chain to dump menu items ranging from espresso to McWraps. Thompson had moved to trim McDonald’s menu, but franchisees have said they want bigger changes, faster. Even so, some skeptics questioned whether Easterbrook, an insider with some two decades at the chain who takes the helm on March 1, is the right person to make the tough decisions needed to fix what ails the company.  Supporters find hope that fact that from 2011 to 2013, Easterbrook ran PizzaExpress, a British chain that markets itself on quality and freshness, and then became CEO at Wagamama, a Japanese-inspired noodle chain, before returning to McDonald’s to oversee marketing, menus and technology. Easterbrook’s global chops may come in handy as the chain fights to recover from a food scare in China that battered Asian sales and wrestles with economic weakness and political upheaval in Europe, its top revenue market. Its image in the United States is also getting a drubbing from McDonald’s burger flippers, who have held frequent protests calling for higher wages. Richard Adams, a former McDonald’s franchisee who now consults current ones, said most U.S. McDonald’s owners don’t have personal experience with Easterbrook but that they are “cautiously optimistic” about his appointment.  Those same franchisees had a rough ride under Thompson. Monthly sales at established U.S. restaurants increased in just 12 of the 30 months he has held the top job.   McDonald’s attempted to stem market share losses to smaller and more nimble rivals ranging from Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and Burger King to Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N), Chic-fil-A  and Five Guys Burgers and Fries with frequent specials and giveaways.  Shares in burger chain Shake Shack Inc (SHAK.N) more than doubled in its first day of trading on Friday, in a pointed contrast with the lackluster performance of McDonald’s, whose shares are down 1.3 percent over the past year. While discounting helped the parent company, which gets franchise royalties based on revenues, they squeezed the franchisee profits. Beyond that, a push to rebuild or remodel restaurants burdened many franchisees with debt but didn’t always deliver a pop in sales.  Adams said morale among U.S. franchisees is at the lowest point since the late 1990s, when overbuilding hurt franchisees. “Made For You”, a 90s-era burger customization program that required investments of around $55,000 per outlet, made matters worse by battering service speed and sales, Adams said.  Thompson revived bad memories of that era with a project called “Create Your Taste,” which he said would succeed where “Made for You” had failed due to improved technology.  While Thompson said the plan would allow McDonald’s to become more like Chipotle and Subway by letting customers select sandwich toppings, Adams said franchisees aren’t buying in. Their reaction to the plan, he said, has been “A chorus of No’s.”  While most franchisees are reluctant to speak to the press, they offered blunt recommendations in a survey published earlier this month by Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski.  Change is “moving too slow, let’s bite the bullet,” one survey respondent said.  They suggested dropping McCafe espresso drinks, which critics say don’t sell enough to pay for the electricity used by the machines that make them. Thompson spearheaded McDonald’s domestic McCafe expansion during his stint as head of the U.S. business.  They also want to cut the number of Happy Meal options, to get rid of the hard-to-make McWraps and other poorly performing menu items, and to eliminate redundant items such as the McDouble and Double Cheeseburger. “We just have no momentum any more,” one franchisee said.

Richard Adams, a former McDonald’s franchisee who now consults current ones, said that most U.S. McDonald’s owners don’t have personal experience with Easterbrook but that they are “cautiously optimistic” about his appointment. Those same franchisees had a rough ride under Thompson. Monthly sales at established U.S. restaurants increased in fewer than half of the 30 months he was in the top job. The company attempted to stem market share losses to smaller and more nimble rivals ranging from Wendy’s Co and Burger King to Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and Chic-fil-A with frequent specials and giveaways. While such discounts helped the parent company, which gets royalties from franchises based on revenues, they squeezed the profits of franchisees. Beyond that, a push to rebuild or remodel most restaurants burdened many franchisees with debt but didn’t always deliver a promised pop in sales. Adams said morale among U.S. franchisees is at the lowest point since the late 1990s, when overbuilding hurt franchisees. “Made For You”, a 90s-era burger customization program that required investments of around $55,000 per outlet, made matters worse by battering service speed and sales. Thompson revived bad memories of that era with a project called “Create Your Taste,” which he insisted would succeed where “Made for You” had failed due to improved technology. While Thompson said the plan would allow McDonald’s to become more like Chipotle and Subway by letting customers pick the ingredients in their meals, Adams said franchisees aren’t buying in. Their reaction to the plan, he said, has been “A chorus of No’s.” While most franchisees are reluctant to speak to the press, they offered blunt recommendations in a survey published earlier this month by Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski. Change is “moving too slow, let’s bite the bullet,” one survey respondent said. They suggested dropping McCafe espresso drinks, which critics say don’t sell enough to pay for the electricity used by the machines that make them. Thompson spearheaded McDonald’s McCafe expansion during his stint as head of the U.S. business. They also want to cut the number of Happy Meal options, to get rid of the hard-to-make McWraps and other poorly performing menu items, and to eliminate redundant items such as the McDouble and Double Cheeseburger. Thompson had made some efforts to trim back menus, but franchisees say they didn’t go far enough. “We just have no momentum any more,” one franchisee said.

673,MCD,McDonald's to slow Russia expansion due to fall in rouble,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp. (MCD.N) will open fewer new restaurants in Russia this year than last because a fall in the rouble has increased expansion costs and is hurting consumers, its Russian chief executive Khamzat Khasbulatov told Reuters. The rouble, hit by a drop in oil prices and Western sanctions over Ukraine, has fallen more than 50 percent since early 2014, fuelling inflation. Russia now faces its first recession since 2009. McDonald’s will open at least 50 new restaurants in Russia compared to 73 last year, having earmarked 6 billion rubles ($87 million) for capital expenditures, the same amount as in 2014, Khasbulatov said in an interview. “There is a major currency component in new openings. Given the current conditions of doing business in Russia ... we are pleased that the investment resources we have been allocated remained at last year’s level,” he said on Saturday. The U.S. fast-food chain, which has been operating in Russia for 25 years, was hit by a string of snap inspections by a state regulator last year, which were widely seen as retaliation for the West’s sanctions against Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis. Those inspections led to temporary closures of 12 restaurants, including the world’s busiest on the Pushkin square in Moscow. Khasbulatov said the company had taken advantage of some of the closures to modernize the restaurants. All have reopened but their sales have yet to catch up with pre-closure levels. The unexpected scrutiny had not led McDonald’s to changing its attitude towards the market, Khasbulatov said. “New restaurants must meet our profitability expectations. (Fewer openings) is only a question of having a healthy business,” he said. He added same-store sales growth could fall to zero in 2015 because of high inflation and an expected decline in spending on eating out, but new openings should help grow overall sales.

McDonald’s Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd (2702.T), which operates the fast food chain’s second-largest restaurant network in the world, has already flagged an annual loss for 2014, its first since it listed in 2001. It reports earnings on Thursday and is expected to give forecasts for this year. With same-store sales sliding in Japan, analysts said they don’t expect a quick turnaround in a country where consumers are highly attuned to food quality issues. “First they have to regain consumer trust, even if it costs a lot. After that they need to focus on developing a menu that is clear and easy to understand,” said Kyoichiro Shigemura, an analyst at Nomura Securities.  The problems are an added distraction for McDonald’s Corp, the world’s largest restaurant chain by sales, which last month replaced its CEO with Chief Brand Officer Steve Easterbrook following one of its worst financial years in decades. McDonald’s Japan in October forecast a 17 billion yen ($145 million) annual net loss after a major Chinese supplier of chicken was found to have been in breach of food safety standards. That is likely to widen after the company was forced to temporarily ration fries due to labor disputes at U.S. West Coast ports and take the costly step of shipping some by air. Same-store sales dropped by a fifth in December from a year earlier. Food safety issues arose again last month with the news that customers had found foreign objects, including a tooth, in McDonald’s Japan food - only boding ill for its outlook for this year. “It will take time for the company to recover trust,” said Seiichiro Samejima of Ichiyoshi Research Institute, who sees a return to profit in 2016.  The problems at McDonald’s Japan prompted Chief Executive Sarah Casanova last month to shift oversight of the supply chain to the chief financial officer. The company has also since announced new measures that will see third-party inspections of its kitchens. Increased competition is also a concern.

684,MCD,"McDonald's India cuts salt, calories in burgers and fries","MUMBAI (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp is cutting the amount of calories and salt on its Indian menu as it fights to hold on to customers in a rapidly growing developing market where newer, healthier fast-food options are just starting to catch on. The burger chain is known globally for the consistency of its food, down to the thickness of fries or the amount of cheese on burgers, and changes run the risk of upsetting customers who expect the same taste on every visit, everywhere. Amit Jatia, vice president of one of India’s two main McDonald’s franchisees, said that changes to reduce sodium and calories in fries, buns and sauces had been done gradually, and were subtle enough to keep taste consistent and customers happy. McDonald’s has not talked about these changes previously. “It wasn’t as if we suddenly cut the salt in our foods one day. Our menu and sourcing teams have been working to make slight alterations for months now,” Jatia told Reuters in an interview. McDonald’s in India has cut sodium in its sauces and buns by 10 percent and in fries by 20 percent, Jatia said. Calories in sauces are down by 30-40 percent over the last six months. Loyalists interviewed in Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai said they did not detect any difference in taste. “I order in from McD’s at least twice a month and think it tastes pretty much the same,” said Rahul Dutta, 29, a marketing executive based in New Delhi.  Jatia heads the south and western McDonald’s franchisees in India, running 202 stores and 30 cafes. Another group controls the north and east, with 166 restaurants. Rising levels of obesity, once just a problem of rich nations that the World Health Organisation says is increasingly affecting low and middle-income countries, has put pressure on fast food chain’s globally to offer healthier food.  In a recent corporate social responsibility report, McDonald’s said that by 2020 it aimed to offer sides of salads, fruit or vegetables as a substitute for fries in its value meals in 20 major markets. The reduction of salt in fries, buns and nuggets was part of a global push to reduce sodium levels in its food, McDonald’s said, while the reduction of oils in sauces was a local initiative in India. The changes have reduced the calorie impact of a burger by 7-8 percent, it said. The chain trimmed salt in fries at its British restaurants in 2006. Some analysts think this is the chain’s way of getting out ahead of a looming burger war in India. In its bigger markets like the United States, McDonald’s is losing customers to chains like Panera Bread or Chipotle Mexican Grill, which are seen as selling food with fresher ingredients. That was part of the reason behind an abrupt management change at McDonald’s last month, when CEO Don Thompson left after three years on the job. In India, where obesity is a growing problem and incidence of diabetes is rising rapidly, more international chains are moving in to challenge McDonald’s dominance. Burger King [BKCBK.UL], Carl’s Junior, Johnny Rockets and Wendy’s [WEN.UL] have announced plans or already set up shop, posing stiffer competition to McDonald’s and Yum Brand’s KFC, which gave been around for about a decade. Technopak predicts the industry will be worth 490 billion rupees ($7.92 billion) by 2020, up from 154.4 billion rupees ($2.50 billion) last year. Like rival Yum Brands, McDonald’s has made changes to its traditional menu to suit cultural norms in the majority Hindu  country, steering clear of beef and pork while offering vegetarian sandwiches and egg-free mayonnaise. India accounts for a small portion of McDonald’s global sales of $27.4 billion, but is among its fastest growing markets. Jatia said the aim was to open as many as 250 stores in the next three to five years. Analyst Sushmul Maheswari of business and consultancy firm RNCOS said the India unit has been growing at 11 percent over the past three years, and part of its success was down to consistency. “McDonald’s burger and fries are popular because they have that peculiar taste that is available only with them,” he said. “They cannot tinker with that, even if they are healthy tweaks.” ($1 = 61.8460 Indian rupees) (This version of the story corrects number of cafes to 30 in paragraph 8) ",2102015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-india/mcdonalds-india-cuts-salt-calories-in-burgers-and-fries-idUSKBN0LE00E20150210

McDonald’s has not talked about these changes previously. “It wasn’t as if we suddenly cut the salt in our foods one day. Our menu and sourcing teams have been working to make slight alterations for months now,” Jatia told Reuters in an interview. McDonald’s in India has cut sodium in its sauces and buns by 10 percent and in fries by 20 percent, Jatia said. Calories in sauces are down by 30-40 percent over the last six months. Loyalists interviewed in Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai said they did not detect any difference in taste. “I order in from McD’s at least twice a month and think it tastes pretty much the same,” said Rahul Dutta, 29, a marketing executive based in New Delhi. Jatia heads the south and western McDonald’s franchisees in India, running 202 stores and 30 cafes. Another group controls the north and east, with 166 restaurants. Rising levels of obesity, once just a problem of rich nations that the World Health Organisation says is increasingly affecting low and middle-income countries, has put pressure on fast food chain’s globally to offer healthier food. In a recent corporate social responsibility report, McDonald’s said that by 2020 it aimed to offer sides of salads, fruit or vegetables as a substitute for fries in its value meals in 20 major markets. The reduction of salt in fries, buns and nuggets was part of a global push to reduce sodium levels in its food, McDonald’s said, while the reduction of oils in sauces was a local initiative in India. The changes have reduced the calorie impact of a burger by 7-8 percent, it said. The chain trimmed salt in fries at its British restaurants in 2006. Some analysts think this is the chain’s way of getting out ahead of a looming burger war in India. In its bigger markets like the United States, McDonald’s is losing customers to chains like Panera Bread or Chipotle Mexican Grill, which are seen as selling food with fresher ingredients. That was part of the reason behind an abrupt management change at McDonald’s last month, when CEO Don Thompson left after three years on the job. In India, where obesity is a growing problem and incidence of diabetes is rising rapidly, more international chains are moving in to challenge McDonald’s dominance. Burger King, Carl’s Junior, Johnny Rockets and Wendy’s have announced plans or already set up shop, posing stiffer competition to McDonald’s and Yum Brand’s  KFC, which gave been around for about a decade. Technopak predicts the industry will be worth 490 billion rupees ($7.92 billion) by 2020, up from 154.4 billion rupees ($2.50 billion) last year. Like rival Yum Brands, McDonald’s has made changes to its traditional menu to suit cultural norms in the majority Hindu  country, steering clear of beef and pork while offering vegetarian sandwiches and egg-free mayonnaise. India accounts for a small portion of McDonald’s global sales of $27.4 billion, but is among its fastest growing markets. Jatia said the aim was to open as many as 250 stores in the next three to five years. Analyst Sushmul Maheswari of business and consultancy firm RNCOS said the India unit has been growing at 11 percent over the past three years, and part of its success was down to consistency. “McDonald’s burger and fries are popular because they have that peculiar taste that is available only with them,” he said. “They cannot tinker with that, even if they are healthy tweaks.” ($1 = 61.8460 Indian rupees)   (Editing by Emily Kaiser and Alex Richardson)",2102015,http://www.reuters.com/article/mcdonalds-india/corrected-mcdonalds-india-cuts-salt-calories-in-burgers-and-fries-idUSL4N0VG61L20150210
686,MCD,Hedge fund Glenview's Robbins lists McDonald's as a favorite pick,"NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Larry Robbins on Thursday called fast food restaurant McDonald’s Corp  a “uniquely interesting opportunity” thanks to a new chief executive and a board that he expects will become more focused over the coming months. Robbins, who runs the $11 billion Glenview Capital Management hedge fund and was ranked as 2013’s best performing hedge fund manager, listed McDonald’s as one of his portfolio’s lesser-known favorite picks - placing it alongside his more-widely-discussed favorites Thermo Fisher, Monsanto  and Flextronics. Robbins attends many conferences and talks often about his top picks. At the Harbor Investment Conference he joked that he’s talked about everything. McDonald’s operating characteristics are “subpar,” he said, but he thinks Steve Easterbrook, who will take over the CEO role on March 1, is aware of this and will work on it. He also said that nominations for directors to McDonald’s board can be made, which suggests that new members might join.  “At a minimum, the board will be more focused,” Robbins said. Robbins also said that the fund had trimmed its investments in hospital-sector companies going into the end of 2014. He did not elaborate on why. At the end of the third quarter, Tenet Healthcare Corp  was one of his biggest investments. Generally, Robbins, whose Capital Opportunity Fund gained an average 57 percent a year over the last three years, said he likes to pick business sectors where companies allocate capital well rather than trying to pick individual winners and losers. Robbins was being interviewed about his favorite picks by William Ackman, the best hedge fund manager of 2014. Ackman and Mark Axelowitz, a managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management, run the conference.

687,MCD,"McDonald's needs to shake up board, union fund adviser says","(Reuters) - Union pension fund adviser CtW Investment Group on Friday demanded in a letter to key McDonald’s Corp directors that the struggling fast-food chain follow up its recent chief executive officer replacement with a turnover of its board. The demand from CtW comes two weeks after McDonald’s announced that Chief Brand Officer Steve Easterbrook would replace Don Thompson in the top job on March 1 and as unions have been seeking to organize fast-food workers and raise wages. The union pension funds that CtW advises hold a small percentage of McDonald’s outstanding shares that are worth $268 million. CtW Executive Director Dieter Waizenegger, in a letter addressed to board Chairman Andrew McKenna and Governance Committee Chairman Miles White, said the replacement of Thompson fell short of what is required to fix the world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue. “Returning McDonald’s Corp to a path of long-term, profitable growth requires that Mr. Steven Easterbrook’s appointment as CEO is followed by a robust refreshment of the board’s membership and leadership,” Waizenegger wrote in the letter, which was obtained by Reuters. McDonald’s did not immediately respond to requests for comment. McDonald’s, which recently reported one of its worst years in decades, has suffered eight straight months of worldwide same-restaurant sales declines. It is editing bloated menus, experimenting with technology and revamping its advertising to appeal to diners, who increasingly are demanding fresher, healthier food. McDonald’s board, which consists of many long-term and Chicago-area directors, has failed to evolve with the global company’s changing circumstances, Waizenegger said.     “We believe it is critical for McDonald’s to have strong, independent board leadership. Fresh eyes are essential,” said Waizenegger. He took particular aim at McKenna, an octogenarian who has been McDonald’s non-executive chairman since April 2004 and a director since 1991. While Waizenegger conceded that the recent addition of Google Inc executive Margo Georgiadis to the McDonald’s board was a positive, he called on the company to announce plans that include a board succession strategy “that will, by the time of the annual shareholder meeting, have prompted both board arrivals and departures.”     CtW, which advises funds holding nearly 3 million McDonald’s shares, unsuccessfully lobbied investors at last year’s annual meeting to vote against the pay package for CEO Thompson.  Some unions have helped organize fast-food workers in a nationwide campaign that seeks to roughly double their hourly wage to $15. Protesters involved with that campaign have targeted McDonald’s and other large companies.

690,MCD,"UPDATE 4-New menu items help drive Burger King, Tim Hortons sales jump","(Updates with details on sales growth, McDonald’s context, market reaction) By Solarina Ho TORONTO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Restaurant Brands International Inc, the parent of Burger King and Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons, reported robust quarterly sales growth on Tuesday, crediting new menu items for driving traffic. Shares of the Oakville, Ontario-based company, which have soared more than 40 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange since being listed in December, jumped another 10.1 percent on Tuesday to C$53.14. The stock rose even though the company, which opened nearly 900 new restaurants in 2014, posted a hefty quarterly loss on one-time merger-related costs. U.S. chain Burger King bought Tim Hortons for C$12.64 billion ($10.21 billion) in August, creating the world’s third-largest fast-food restaurant group. The two chains are managed as separate brands under the parent company. Investors are keen to see if Tim’s dominance in the Canadian coffee market can help chip away at McDonald’s Corp’s  leadership in the U.S. quick-serve breakfast market. Restaurant Brands executives credited new menu items like Burger King’s A1 ultimate bacon cheeseburger and Tim Horton’s dark roast blend coffee for helping drive sales gains in the quarter. The results contrasted with those of McDonald’s, which has been fighting to win back customers and reported one of its worst years in decades with eight straight months of global same-restaurant sales declines. Comparable store sales grew 4.1 percent at Tim Hortons and 3 percent at Burger King in the quarter, Restaurant Brands said. On a constant currency basis, system-wide sales grew 7.4 percent at Tim Hortons and 7.7 percent at Burger King. Last month, the company cut some 350 corporate jobs at Tim Hortons as part of the post-merger reorganization. “We executed our organizational restructuring up front, which really focused on back office, corporate areas where we said we’d see overlap in the business,” Chief Executive Daniel Schwartz told Reuters. “We have no plans to have any more job cuts.” Executives said they would focus on deleveraging and reinvesting in the business. Tim Hortons’ U.S and international growth would be a top priority, but something that would take time, they added. Restaurant Brands, which has more than 19,000 restaurants in 100 countries, posted a net loss attributable to shareholders of $514.2 million, or $2.52 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, in its first quarterly results after the merger. The company reported total revenue of $416.3 million in the quarter.

698,MCD,Coffee's hot as IPO could value India's Cafe Coffee Day at $1 bln,"MUMBAI, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The firm behind Cafe Coffee Day, India’s biggest homegrown coffee chain, is set for a market debut that could value it at almost $1 billion, even as the country’s burgeoning cafe culture draws global giants Starbucks  and McDonald’s. Cafe Coffee Day, a cafe pioneer in India, aims to list a 20 percent stake, raising roughly $200 million, within the next quarter, sources with direct knowledge of the plans said. It has hired investment banks Kotak Mahindra Capital and Citigroup among other advisors and plans to file for the listing by the end of April, the sources said. Cafe Coffee Day, Citi and Kotak did not respond to requests for comment. India’s biggest cafe operator opened its first shop in 1996 and has grown to more than 1,500 outlets as more young, urban consumers opt for cappuccino over tea and seek out spaces to socialise in overcrowded, traffic-congested cities. The IPO comes as India’s sluggish economy is showing signs of life, fuelling hopes of a consumer spending recovery that has boosted shares in food chain operators such as Jubilant Foodworks Ltd, which owns the Domino’s Pizza franchise in India. Jubilant shares are up 20 percent this year and trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 62.5 times, nearly 4 times the average across the NSE shares index. India’s cafe market is worth 18.2 billion rupees and is growing at 20 percent annually, according to estimates by consultancy Technopak. “This company would see heavy interest from investors given it’s a play on the high potential Indian consumer sector, and due to a revival in the Indian IPO market,” said Nirakar Pradhan, chief investment officer at Future Generali India Life Insurance. Still, the chain faces competition from global rivals that have already edged out some peers. Italy’s Lavazza in August announced plans to pull out of the cafe business in India by selling its Barista chain. Tata Starbucks Ltd, a joint venture between the Seattle-based chain and India’s Tata Global Beverages Ltd , has opened 68 shops across India in the past two years. “Starbucks has been looking at India for 10 years now, but only got in two years ago. They have to make up for lost time,” said Harminder Sahni of retail consulting firm Wazir Advisors. Meanwhile, Hardcastle Restaurants, one of two McDonald’s franchises in India, plans to have 50-75 McCafes by the end of the year, up from its current 30.

699,MCD,UPDATE 2-McDonald's USA to phase out human antibiotics from chicken supply,"(Adds detail on why chicken producers use antibiotics) By Lisa Baertlein and P.J. Huffstutter LOS ANGELES/CHICAGO March 4 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s  U.S. restaurants will gradually stop buying chicken raised with antibiotics vital to fighting human infections, the most aggressive step by a major food company to change chicken producers’ practices in the fight against dangerous ‘superbugs.’ The world’s biggest restaurant chain announced on Wednesday that within two years, McDonald’s USA will only buy chickens raised without antibiotics that are important to human medicine. The concern is that the overuse of antibiotics for poultry may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans. McDonald’s policy will begin at the hatchery, where chicks are sometimes injected with antibiotics while still in the shell. “We’re listening to our customers,” Marion Gross, senior vice president of McDonald’s North American supply chain, told Reuters. She said the company is working with its domestic chicken suppliers, including Tyson Foods Inc, to make the transition. Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal. However, as the rate of human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria increases, consumer advocates and public health experts have become more critical of the practice of routinely feeding antibiotics to chickens, cattle and pigs. Scientists and public health experts say whenever an antibiotic is administered, it kills weaker bacteria and can enable the strongest to survive and multiply. Frequent use of low-dose antibiotics, a practice used by some meat producers, can intensify that effect. The risk, they say, is that so-called superbugs might develop cross-resistance to critical, medically important antibiotics. Superbugs are linked to an estimated 23,000 human deaths and 2 million illnesses every year in the United States, and up to $20 billion in direct healthcare costs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Poultry producers began using antibiotics in the 1940s, not long after scientists discovered that penicillin, streptomycin and chlortetracycline helped control outbreaks of disease in chickens. The drugs offered an added benefit: They kept the birds’ digestive tracts healthy, and chickens were able to gain more weight without eating more food. Gross said McDonald’s expects its suppliers will treat any animals that become ill, using antibiotics when prescribed. McDonald’s, however, will not buy those treated chickens, she said. The poultry industry’s lobby takes issue with the concerns of government and academic scientists, saying there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people. This may be a “tipping point for antibiotic use in the poultry industry,” said Jonathan Kaplan, the Natural Resources Defense Council’s food and agriculture program director. “McDonald’s has so much purchasing power and brand recognition, I think we’re seeing a new industry standard here,” Kaplan said. “For public health, this is really a game changer,” said Gail Hansen, a senior officer for Pew Charitable Trusts’ antibiotic resistance project. There are exceptions to McDonald’s new policy. The company will buy chicken from farmers who “responsibly use” ionophores, an animal antibiotic not used in human medical treatment, Gross said. The phase-out applies only to McDonald’s roughly 14,000 U.S. restaurants. It currently does not affect the company’s approximately 22,000 international restaurants. The action by McDonald’s, which has been fighting to win back diners and bolster sagging U.S. sales, is in step with consumer demand for food made with ‘clean’ and more ‘natural’ ingredients. But it falls short of similar policies at smaller  chains such as Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panera Bread Co, which ban the use of ionophores. Tyson, the largest U.S. meat processor, told Reuters in a statement it supported McDonald’s decision and that its chicken operations have reduced the use of antibiotics that are effective in humans by more than 84 percent since 2011. The company expects to continue reductions. A Reuters investigation last year revealed that some of the nation’s largest poultry producers routinely fed chickens an array of antibiotics, not just when sickness strikes, but as a standard practice over most of the birds’ lives. The Reuters report also found that low doses of antibiotics were part of the standard diet for some of Tyson’s flocks, including two internal company documents showing the use of bacitracin. Though that drug is not classified as medically important by the federal Food and Drug Administration, bacitracin is commonly used to prevent human skin infections. Tyson said it disagreed with the findings of the Reuters investigation but has since taken further steps to reduce or halt antibiotic use, including in its chicken hatcheries.

700,MCD,Fitch Affirms McDonald's IDRs at 'A/F1'; Outlook Revised to Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings  (IDRs) of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) at 'A/F1'. The Rating Outlook has  been revised to Negative from Stable.  At Dec. 31, 2014, McDonald's had approximately $15 billion of total debt. A full  list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. Negative Outlook: The Outlook revision is due to persistently weak global same-store sales (SSS),  declining store-level profitability, and increased leverage. Global SSS were  negative 1% in 2014, after being flat at 0.2% in 2013, with guest counts  declining 1.9% in 2013 and 3.6% in 2014. Consolidated company-operated  restaurant margin contracted 160 basis points to 15.9% in 2014, continuing a  multi-year decline that began in 2010. Lastly, total debt/EBITDA and total  adjusted debt/EBITDAR were 1.5x and 2.6x, respectively, at Dec. 31, 2014 up from  1.4x and 2.4x in 2013. Fitch's current rating incorporated that total debt/EBITDA and total adjusted  debt/EBITDA (rent-adjusted leverage) would approximate 1.5x and 2.5x,  respectively, while considering McDonald's leading global market position, brand  strength, system health, and significant financial flexibility. However, recent  SSS trends, market share losses, and the decline in operating income results in  little room for further downside. The modest increase in leverage during 2014 was due to an 8% decline in constant  currency operating income and $1.5 billion of incremental debt to help fund the  company's $18 - $20 billion three-year cash shareholder return target. Fitch's  base case projection is that total debt/EBITDA and rent-adjusted leverage will  increase to 1.6x and 2.7x, respectively, in 2015 and 2016 due to flat SSS,  limited operating income growth and modestly higher debt to partially finance  share repurchases. Fitch believes McDonald's sales will gradually benefit from increasing real  disposable income in the U.S, particularly for low-to-middle income consumers,  and brand-level initiatives around the world but views continued market share  losses as likely in 2015. Restaurant margins will also remain pressured given  weak sales and rising U.S. labor costs. Pricing remains limited due to  relatively low inflation, heightened competition, and still weak economic  conditions in most of Europe (which represented 40% of revenue and 41% of  operating income in 2014). McDonald's expects modest 1.5% - 2% commodity  inflation in the U.S. and Europe for 2015.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  Same-Store Sales and Market Share Trends As mentioned previously, McDonald's ratings incorporate its position as the  world's largest restaurant chain, with about $88 billion in system sales, 36,000  plus units, and over $27 billion of revenue. However, global SSS have been weak  for two consecutive years. Market share losses have occurred in the U.S. but,  according to the company, trends vary across Europe. McDonald's attributes economic conditions, heightened competition, and  unanticipated business interruptions caused by a supplier issue affecting the  Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa (APMEA) segment, and temporary store  closures in Russia for its challenges. Fitch also views modest slippage in  restaurant service, less effective promotions, and negative perceptions  regarding the brand's food among certain consumer demographics that prefer less  processed food with fresh ingredients as drivers. McDonald's intensified its  focus on value in 2013 and 2014 in order to drive traffic but annual guest  counts became increasingly negative across most major geographies.  Effectiveness of Brand Initiatives  McDonald's new CEO, officially as of March 1, is expected to accelerate efforts  to improve the brand image globally. In December 2014, the company detailed a  strategy to regain SSS growth in its core U.S. market. Plans entail simplifying  the menu to improve service and address local customer preferences, and creating  the Experience of the Future which includes, among other initiatives, a new  Create Your Taste (CYT) customizable burger platform. McDonald's also remains  focused on improving SSS in other priority markets including Germany, Japan, and  Australia.  Fitch views a cohesive and aggressive system-wide effort to improve service,  emphasize food quality, and provide locally-relevant menu variety as necessary  catalysts for SSS growth. McDonald's plan to launch CYT in the up to 2,000 U.S.  restaurants by the end of 2015 will likely have a limited near-term positive  impact on the company's image in the burger category as it only represents 14%  of total domestic locations. McDonald's brand recovery efforts in Japan will  also take time to resonate with consumers because of a high level of  competition, particularly in the convenience channel, and food quality incidents  beyond the July 2014 APMEA supplier challenge. Substantial but Decelerating Cash Flow Growth McDonald's generates substantial cash flow from operations at $6.7 billion in  2014. CFO declined 5% in 2014 due to lower sales and operating income, after  growing at an 8% CAGR from the launch of the firm's Plan to Win strategy in 2003  to $7.1 billion in 2013. Free cash flow (FCF - defined as CFO less capex less  dividends) remained meaningful at $931 million due to lower capex but was below  the company's annual average of $1.5 billion from 2010 to 2013.  Fitch expects CFO trends to stabilize in 2015 and then grow at a low  single-digit rate in 2016. FCF in 2015 will be enhanced by reductions in capex  as McDonald's slows unit growth in its most challenged countries and focuses on  regaining sales momentum but debt reduction is not anticipated.  McDonald's expects to spend about $2 billion in capex during 2015, down from  $2.6 billion in 2014 and the lowest level in five years. Capex will be allocated  roughly 50/50 between new units and reinvesting in existing locations, as  modernizing the customer experience remains a key global priority. Net  restaurant additions will be between 600 and 700, representing about 1.8%  expansion in 2015. Increasingly Aggressive Financial Strategy  Fitch views McDonald's financial strategy as increasingly aggressive given  negative SSS trends and the loss of market share. McDonald's has publicly  reiterated plans to return $18 billion - $20 billion in aggregate dividends and  share repurchases from 2014 through 2016, a 10% - 20% increase versus payouts  during the three-years ended 2013, despite weaker than expected operating  results. Fitch views McDonald's reduction of new unit capex as prudent given  weak sales and declining margins. As mentioned previously, FCF will be enhanced,  but debt reduction is not anticipated.  Cohesive Operating Framework, Franchising Fitch believes the continued alignment of corporate, franchisees and suppliers  to meet customer needs as critical to McDonald's success. The company's  significant scale is a benefit, providing bargaining power with procurement,  unmatched advertising capability, and convenient locations for consumers.  However, the ability to quickly adjust to consumer trends is likely difficult  due to its massive infrastructure.  McDonald's 81%/19% global mix of franchised to company stores at Dec. 31, 2014  supports cash flow, augments corporate margins, and assists with the rollout of  new system initiatives. High-margin royalties and contractual rent payments from  franchising represented 34% of revenue in 2014. McDonald's is on track to  refranchise 1,500 units from 2014 to 2016, mainly across Europe and APMEA, but  its ownership mix is not expected to change materially leaving company-owned  stores directly exposed to rising costs. McDonald's owns roughly 45% of the land and about 70% of the buildings within  its system. Fitch believes the company's strong asset base solidifies its  relationship with franchisees, increases the stability of its cash flow, reduces  contingent liabilities, and distinguishes McDonald's from its peers. Financial Flexibility, Liquidity, and Maturities:  McDonald's financial flexibility is supported by its substantial operating cash  flow, good FCF generation, ready market access, and high level of liquidity. At  Dec. 31, 2014, McDonald's had $4.6 billion of liquidity consisting of $2.1  billion of cash, of which $1.2 billion was held offshore, and availability under  an undrawn $2.5 billion committed revolver expiring December 2019. The company  had $200 million of commercial paper (CP) outstanding under its $2.5 billion CP  program at year end.  About 60% of McDonald's $15 billion of debt at Dec. 31, 2014 was U.S.  denominated and 40% was foreign denominated. Upcoming debt maturities  approximated $1.1 billion in 2015, $823 million in 2016, and $1 billion in 2017  based on year-end foreign exchange rates. Fitch views maturities as manageable  given McDonald's strong market access and annual FCF. McDonald's plans to  refinance its 2015 maturities. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --SSS are flat in 2015 and growth resumes to the low single-digit level by 2016; --Company-operated restaurant margins stabilize by 2016; --Operating cash flow stabilizes in 2015 and grows at a low single-digit rate  thereafter; --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA and total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR  (defined as total debt plus 8x gross rents-to-operating EBITDA plus gross rents)  approximates 1.6x and 2.7x, respectively, in 2015 and 2016; --FCF approximates $1 billion or more annually. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --If Fitch ascertains that global SSS will be negative in 2015 and market share  trends do not stabilize; --Management demonstrates an unwillingness to pull back on share repurchases if  sales trends continue to deteriorate;  --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA and total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR  sustained above 1.5x and 2.5x, respectively. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --An upgrade is not likely in the near term, given recent weak SSS trends,  on-going margin contraction, and increased leverage; --The Rating Outlook could  be revised to Stable if SSS are better than Fitch anticipates, market share  trends stabilize, or leverage is maintained below current levels. Fitch has affirmed its ratings on McDonald's as follows:  --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --Bank credit facilities at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'.

701,MCD,McDonald's antibiotic-free move could prompt U.S. chicken squeeze,"(Reuters) - A plan by McDonald’s Corp to phase out chicken raised with certain kinds of antibiotics at its 14,000 U.S. restaurants will put additional pressure on an already-stressed supply chain. Antibiotic-free chicken currently accounts for a tiny portion of total U.S. supplies, and an increasing desire on the part of consumers for more “natural” products has meant that demand sometimes exceeds supply.  Available product has been so tight that when six of the largest U.S. school districts tried to make the switch to antibiotic-free poultry last year, chicken sellers such as Tyson Foods Inc and Pilgrim’s Pride Corp said they could not change their production systems quickly enough to meet the demand. The decision by the world’s biggest restaurant chain to jump into the fray seems likely to complicate things further, tightening supply and thereby raising prices, said Athlos Research principal Jonathan Feeney.  “This is very likely to cause a disruption in McDonald’s food supply and will likely raise operating costs for McDonald’s franchisees,” added Richard Adams, a former McDonald’s franchisee who now runs the consulting firm Franchise Equity Group.   One key impediment up to now in increasing supplies has been convincing livestock farmers and meat packers to switch to new farming practices that they fear could threaten their profit margins. Routine use of antibiotics can mean larger animals and less disease. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc has some of the restaurant industry’s highest standards for antibiotic-free meats, but it has occasionally had trouble finding supplies.  From time to time its popular burrito restaurants have had to hang signs alerting diners that it was unable to get antibiotic-free chicken, beef or pork. McDonald’s said Wednesday it will eliminate from its menus chicken raised with antibiotics that are “critically important” to human medicine, but unlike Chipotle, it will continue to purchase chicken raised with ionophores, an animal antibiotic commonly added to feed.  Public health advocates cheered McDonald’s chicken plans on Wednesday, but they also pushed the chain to go further.   Jonathan Kaplan, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s food and agriculture program noted that McDonald’s new antibiotic policy has a “disappointing loophole” in that it covers only chicken and only U.S. restaurants.  He also would like to see the chain expand its policy to all meats. “Hopefully, chicken is just the start, the Big Mac and McRib may be next,” he said.  Switching to antibiotic-free pork and beef would present even tougher challenges, however. Making adjustment to supplies is easier in animals that mature more rapidly. It takes only about six weeks to get a chicken ready for slaughter, while it takes four to six months to ready a hog for market and 18 months or more for beef cattle.  The company would almost certainly have difficult acquiring enough antibiotic-free beef, which is already in short supply, for its burgers. Chipotle and CKE Restaurants each traveled to Australia to find theirs. CKE Restaurants’ Carl’s Jr chain in December debuted a “natural” burger, from grass-fed cattle raised without antibiotics, steroids or added hormones, in its 1,150 U.S. restaurants. Brad Haley, CKE’s chief marketing officer, said the company would love to start selling similar burgers at its Hardee’s chain, but the company finds itself asking “Where’s the beef?” “I don’t think there’s enough for sizeable chains to move over in the immediate future,” Haley said. “There simply isn’t enough all-natural beef.” Still, McDonald’s told Reuters it will continue to “look at all aspects of food sourcing and our menu”.

703,MCD,Chicken growers set to pay price for no-antibiotic McNugget,"CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s decision last week to phase out human antibiotics from its U.S. chicken supply will add to costs of production in a tight-margin business that are likely to be borne mostly by poultry companies. McDonald’s, whose top chicken suppliers include giant Tyson Foods Inc, has given its producers two years to eradicate all antibiotics used on humans from barns and hatcheries. It’s going to be expensive and may take longer than planned: switching to antibiotic-free chickens could increase on-farm costs by up to 3 percent. Perdue Farms, a supplier with about a third the volume of Tyson, told Reuters it’s taken more than a decade and millions of dollars to make such a change. McDonald’s will use its purchasing muscle as the world’s largest restaurant chain to avoid passing extra costs on to customers, increasingly lower income as more affluent diners prefer competitors like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, said analysts including Morningstar’s R.J. Hottovy. Marion Gross, McDonald’s senior vice president of North America supply chain management, declined to say how much the company’s costs for chicken could rise. Rather, she told Reuters, the project is “an investment” to meet customer demand. While veterinary use of antibiotics is legal, controversy has grown over routine feeding of antibiotics that are important to humans to otherwise healthy chicken, cattle and pigs in a bid to stave off disease and help the animals grow more quickly. The risk is that overuse could spur the creation of so-called superbugs that develop cross-resistance to antibiotics used to treat humans. Reuters found last year that major U.S. poultry firms were administering antibiotics to their flocks on the farm far more pervasively than regulators realized. The poultry industry maintains there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people. However, more restaurants and retailers are heeding the concerns of consumers, straining meat supplies. Sandwich chain Chick-fil-A in 2014 gave its producers five years to meet its commitment to go antibiotic-free for chicken. Perdue is a major supplier to Chick-fil-A. Costco Wholesale Corp., the nation’s third-largest retailer that annually sells 80 million rotisserie chickens, told Reuters Thursday it has a “large” appetite for chicken free of these medically-important antibiotics. The company is aware of the supply difficulties and won’t commit to a timeline, said Craig Wilson, vice president of food safety for Costco. Some of the extra costs of cutting out antibiotics could be borne by franchisees, which could cut labor hours, waste and utility costs to offset higher meat prices. But most analysts expect McDonald’s to push the costs back onto its suppliers, who may not have the market power to resist. The top four U.S. chicken processors control about 53 percent of the domestic market, according to the National Chicken Council. McDonald’s “carries a lot of clout with suppliers,” and some of them are dependent on the chain for survival, Hottovy said. Tyson and Keystone Foods, part of Brazil-based Marfrig Global Foods SA, both told Reuters they have significantly reduced medically-important antibiotic use in their flocks and are positioned to meet McDonald’s and other customers’ needs. However, neither company would answer specific questions about how such drugs are used on-farm and in hatcheries. Perdue, the fourth-largest domestic chicken producer, began removing antibiotics used for growth promotion in 2002 amid consumer questions about what was being put into the animal feed, said Bruce Stewart-Brown, senior vice-president of food safety, quality and live operations. Now more than 95 percent of the chickens it produces are raised without antibiotics approved for human use, and more than half are raised with no antibiotics of any kind, according to the company. The transition led to unexpectedly high bird mortality rates, a need for more chicken houses and spending at least $4 million more a year on vaccines than rivals who haven’t made the switch, among other things.

704,MCD,INSIGHT-Chicken growers set to pay price for no-antibiotic McNugget,"CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES, March 8 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s  decision last week to phase out human antibiotics from its U.S. chicken supply will add to costs of production in a tight-margin business that are likely to be borne mostly by poultry companies. McDonald’s, whose top chicken suppliers include giant Tyson Foods Inc, has given its producers two years to eradicate all antibiotics used on humans from barns and hatcheries. It’s going to be expensive and may take longer than planned: switching to antibiotic-free chickens could increase on-farm costs by up to 3 percent. Perdue Farms, a supplier with about a third the volume of Tyson, told Reuters it’s taken more than a decade and millions of dollars to make such a change. McDonald’s will use its purchasing muscle as the world’s largest restaurant chain to avoid passing extra costs on to customers, increasingly lower income as more affluent diners prefer competitors like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, said analysts including Morningstar’s R.J. Hottovy. Marion Gross, McDonald’s senior vice president of North America supply chain management, declined to say how much the company’s costs for chicken could rise. Rather, she told Reuters, the project is “an investment” to meet customer demand. While veterinary use of antibiotics is legal, controversy has grown over routine feeding of antibiotics that are important to humans to otherwise healthy chicken, cattle and pigs in a bid to stave off disease and help the animals grow more quickly. The risk is that overuse could spur the creation of so-called superbugs that develop cross-resistance to antibiotics used to treat humans. Reuters found last year that major U.S. poultry firms were administering antibiotics to their flocks on the farm far more pervasively than regulators realized. The poultry industry maintains there is little evidence that bacteria which do become resistant also infect people. However, more restaurants and retailers are heeding the concerns of consumers, straining meat supplies. Sandwich chain Chick-fil-A in 2014 gave its producers five years to meet its commitment to go antibiotic-free for chicken. Perdue is a major supplier to Chick-fil-A. Costco Wholesale Corp., the nation’s third-largest retailer that annually sells 80 million rotisserie chickens, told Reuters Thursday it has a “large” appetite for chicken free of these medically-important antibiotics. The company is aware of the supply difficulties and won’t commit to a timeline, said Craig Wilson, vice president of food safety for Costco. Some of the extra costs of cutting out antibiotics could be borne by franchisees, which could cut labor hours, waste and utility costs to offset higher meat prices. But most analysts expect McDonald’s to push the costs back onto its suppliers, who may not have the market power to resist. The top four U.S. chicken processors control about 53 percent of the domestic market, according to the National Chicken Council. McDonald’s “carries a lot of clout with suppliers,” and some of them are dependent on the chain for survival, Hottovy said. Tyson and Keystone Foods, part of Brazil-based Marfrig Global Foods SA, both told Reuters they have significantly reduced medically-important antibiotic use in their flocks and are positioned to meet McDonald’s and other customers’ needs. However, neither company would answer specific questions about how such drugs are used on-farm and in hatcheries. Perdue, the fourth-largest domestic chicken producer, began removing antibiotics used for growth promotion in 2002 amid consumer questions about what was being put into the animal feed, said Bruce Stewart-Brown, senior vice-president of food safety, quality and live operations. Now more than 95 percent of the chickens it produces are raised without antibiotics approved for human use, and more than half are raised with no antibiotics of any kind, according to the company. The transition led to unexpectedly high bird mortality rates, a need for more chicken houses and spending at least $4 million more a year on vaccines than rivals who haven’t made the switch, among other things. Birds raised without antibiotics also generally take three to nine days longer to reach their market weight, Stewart-Brown told Reuters — or as much as 20 percent longer than conventionally raised birds.

Wall Street has fallen for two straight weeks, a downtrend that came on speculation that interest rates could rise sooner than anticipated. Friday’s weakness was driven by a much stronger-than-expected jobs report, which was seen as possibly pressuring the Federal Reserve to act soon on monetary policy. The central bank had said it would raise rates when the economy was strong enough to support such a move. While a more robust economy is better for stocks in the long run, investors have been concerned that a rate rise too soon - which would raise borrowing costs for companies and individuals - could dampen growth as the economy’s recovery has been slow. The S&P; 500 remains about 2 percent below its record closing high. The Dow is also near record levels, while the Nasdaq is 2.4 percent below its record close, hit in March 2000. In deal news, Alcoa Inc said it would buy RTI International Metals Inc for $1.5 billion.  Simon Property Group offered to buy Macerich Co for $22.4 billion. Alcoa lost 4.9 percent to $13.77 while RTI jumped 40.5 percent to $38.33. Macerich rose 5.9 percent to $91.86 while Simon Property was up 0.5 percent at $181.51. “You’ll see these kinds of deals continue to be announced since money is so cheap right now that you can borrow all you need to make them happen,” said Tom Mangan, who helps oversee $6.4 billion as a senior vice president at James Investment Research Inc in Xenia, Ohio. “This will be very good for small-cap stocks, and it also suggests that the market isn’t overly expensive overall.” Whiting Petroleum Corp rose 9.6 percent to $37.35. Late Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company was seeking a possible buyer, though a person familiar with the board’s thinking told Reuters he was not aware of any such plan. McDonald’s Corp same-store sales fell more than expected in February, though the stock rose 0.9 percent to $98. General Motors said it plans a new, $5 billion share buyback in an agreement with dissident investors, and put forward more details on capital allocation that promises investors the potential for further cash returns. Shares rose 3.3 percent to $37.74. At 9:58 a.m. (1358 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average  rose 72.22 points, or 0.4 percent, to 17,929, the S&P; 500  gained 3.91 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,075.17 and the Nasdaq Composite added 6.31 points, or 0.13 percent, to 4,933.68. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,688 to 1,070, for a 1.58-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,352 issues rose and 972 fell, for a 1.39-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. The S&P; 500 was posting 5 new 52-week highs and 7 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 26 new highs and 23 new lows.

February same-restaurant sales were down 4.4 percent in McDonald’s Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) business, which includes China. That was an improvement from the 12.6 percent drop in January, as declines related to the food scandals in China and Japan eased. Analysts on average had estimated a 0.3 percent fall in the company’s worldwide same-restaurant sales in February, according to analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. That included expected declines of 0.7 percent in the United States and 3.1 percent in APMEA.

712,MCD,KFC faces pressure after McDonald's says no antibiotics in chicken,"LOS ANGELES/CHICAGO (Reuters) - KFC, the world’s largest chain of fried chicken restaurants, may face pressure from consumer and environmental groups to change how its poultry are raised after McDonald’s Corp said it would switch to chicken raised without human antibiotics. McDonald’s will phase out chicken raised with antibiotics that are important to human health over two years to allay concern that use of the drugs in meat production has exacerbated the rise of deadly “superbugs” that resist treatment, Reuters reported last week. Within days, retailer Costco Wholesale Corp told Reuters it aims to eliminate the sale of chicken and meat raised with human antibiotics. KFC is owned by Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum Brands Inc, which has no publicly stated policy on antibiotic use in the production of meat it buys. Chick-fil-A, another chicken restaurant chain that competes with KFC, says about 20 percent of the chicken it serves is raised without any antibiotics, and that its entire supply chain will be converted by 2019.  Both McDonald’s and Yum are stepping up efforts to win back younger and wealthier diners lured away by chains such as such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and Panera Bread Co, which boast antibiotic-free meats and other high-quality ingredients. Yum’s KFC restaurants in China two years ago suffered a massive sales hit following local media reports that a few poultry farmers supplying KFC fed excessive levels of antibiotics to their chickens. “The train has left the station,” Bob Goldin, a food services company consultant at Technomic in Chicago, said of McDonald’s influence on U.S. chicken production standards.  Yum, which also owns the Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains, declined to discuss its standards for antibiotic use in meat production. “The chicken served in our U.S. restaurants is USDA high quality, and free of antibiotics,” the company said in an emailed response to Reuters queries.  The antibiotic-free statement refers to a lack of residue in the meat served at its restaurants and not the practice of delivering antibiotics to chickens before they are slaughtered, said Steven Roach, food safety program director at Food Animal Concerns Trust in Chicago. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has three classifications for poultry, A, B, and C, and doesn’t have a “high quality” designation for chicken. Poultry rated A is what’s typically found at retail, while poultry rated B or C is usually used in further-processed products where the meat is cut up, chopped, or ground, according to a USDA website. McDonald’s told Reuters it worked with a wide range of stakeholders, including environmental group Friends of the Earth, to develop its U.S. chicken guidelines. Yum and its brands have ignored requests for information regarding its antibiotic policy, said Kari Hamerschlag, senior program manager for Friends of the Earth’s food and technology program. “They have so far not answered any of our emails or phone calls,” said Hamerschlag, who is working with other advocacy groups to persuade food companies to change their supplier standards to exclude animals raised with the routine use of antibiotics. By contrast, McDonald’s was “very responsive” to the groups’ requests, she said. Other groups working with Friends of the Earth to cut antibiotics from chickens and other meats include the Natural Resources Defense Council, Consumers Union and the Center for Food Safety. Friends of the Earth said its interest in antibiotics has to do with animal agriculture’s connection to the environment and human health. KFC supplier Tyson Foods Inc did not comment. Other U.S. chicken producers that have supplied Yum either declined to comment or could not be reached. It’s not known who KFC’s biggest supplier is or how many chickens KFC buys a year. In 2012, Chinese media reports about excessive antibiotic use by a few KFC chicken farmers hammered sales there. The country has more than 4,800 KFC restaurants and accounted for nearly half of Yum’s 2014 operating profit. In response, Yum dropped some 1,000 small poultry farmers from its supply chain and launched a public relations campaign to reassure diners about the quality and safety of its food.      Yum operates separate supply chains in China and United States. While antibiotics have made for big headlines in China, the issue also has surfaced at home. A Reuters investigation last year found that KFC supplier Koch Foods Inc from November 2011 to July 2014 had given some of its flocks antibiotics critical to fighting human infections, even though its website stated otherwise. The Chicago-based chicken producer changed the language on its website after questions from Reuters about its use of virginiamycin, an antibiotic included in a class considered “highly important” to fighting infections in humans. At the time, Koch said it has no plans to discontinue the use of virginiamycin, which it says may be used to prevent a common intestinal infection in chicken. Koch did not respond to interview requests for this story. KFC US said at the time that its “supply partners must adhere to our strict standards and specifications, which in some cases are more stringent than the FDA’s regulations.” It declined to comment this week.

715,MCD,McDonald's workers claim hazardous conditions in 19 U.S. cities,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp restaurant workers from 19 U.S. cities complained to regulators on Monday that their working conditions are hazardous and have led to severe burns from hot grills and fryer oil. Workers taking part in the Service Employees International Union-backed “Fight for $15” an hour campaign opened a new front in their two-year drive to increase pay and improve conditions in the fast-food industry by filing 28 state and federal complaints over health and safety. McDonald’s workers, who already have claimed that they have been subjected to wage theft, racial discrimination and retaliation for attempting to unionize, hope to hold McDonald’s Corp responsible for the actions of its franchisees. Some experts say a win could force the company to negotiate with workers and the union. The latest complaints, targeting 19 franchised restaurants and nine operated by McDonald’s Corp in cities such as New York, New Orleans and Philadelphia, were filed over the last two weeks with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and state authorities.

Workers taking part in the Service Employees International Union-backed “Fight for $15” an hour campaign opened a new front in their two-year drive to increase pay and improve conditions in the fast-food industry by filing 28 state and federal complaints over health and safety.

719,MCD,Brazilian unions file 2nd lawsuit against McDonald's operator,"SAO PAULO, March 18 (Reuters) - Brazilian unions on Wednesday filed another lawsuit against the largest operator of McDonald’s restaurants in Latin America, alleging that the firm violates the country’s labor laws. The suit against Arcos Dourados Comércio de Alimentos Ltda, the Brazilian division of Buenos Aires-based Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc, came just days after McDonald’s Corp  workers from 19 U.S. cities filed state and federal complaints over working conditions. It also followed a similar filing made by Brazilian unions in late February. Wednesday’s lawsuit aims to “guarantee health and safety in the workplace,” according to a joint statement from the unions, which are backed by CUT and UTG, two of Brazil’s largest labor federations. The unions demand that Arcos Dourados establish specific job functions for each employee and hire more workers under that model while paying compensation for any moral and punitive damages caused to current and former employees. The lawsuit also demands that Arcos Dourados deliver a working plan to Brazil’s labor ministry within 90 days or face a daily fine of 100,000 reais ($30,864). Fines for violations of Brazilian labor law can vary between 1 percent and 30 percent of a company’s annual sales. Arcos Dorados’ Brazilian division had 833 restaurants and total revenue of $460.9 million for the third quarter that ended Sept. 30. A separate lawsuit filed by Brazilian unions on Feb. 24 accused Arcos Dourados of unwholesome and unsanitary working conditions, time-clock fraud and failing to pay mandatory unemployment and retirement insurance. It also said Arcos Dourados paid below legal or contractual minimum wages, forced double-shift work without breaks, made workers take in-restaurant lunch breaks with employer-supplied food and failed to make mandatory severance payments. That suit aims to ban the opening of any new McDonald’s restaurants in Brazil until the problems are fixed. An Arcos Dorados spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that the company had not yet been officially informed of the lawsuit. “Still, the company continues to reaffirm, with conviction, that it complies with all labor laws, respects the rights of all its workers, and maintains labor practices that have been recognized by the market,” the statement said.

725,MCD,McDonald's starts table service in Germany,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) is introducing table service in Germany as it reinvents itself as a “modern, progressive burger company” under new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook. The world’s biggest fast-food chain has been testing myriad new ideas, including kiosk ordering, custom burgers and even a completely new restaurant brand in a bid to revive slumping sales and better compete with more nimble chains ranging from Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) to Burger King (QSR.TO). “This is where McDonald’s is headed,” Easterbrook said at a McDonald’s in the Frankfurt Airport that serves more than 1 million customers a year. Diners at that restaurant can now choose to be served at their table after placing an order at the front counter, via a digital kiosk or with a waiter carrying a tablet computer. McDonald’s has tested table service in other markets, a spokeswoman told Reuters. Easterbrook, 47, made the announcement at the reopening of the restaurant, which is Germany’s biggest with more than 500 seats. Germany has been a challenging market for McDonald’s, which has struggled to find the right recipe for selling to the nation’s health- and cost-conscious diners. McDonald’s executives have identified its priority turnaround markets as Germany, Japan, Australia and the United States, where it plans to expand a custom hamburger program called “Create Your Taste” and next month will start testing all-day breakfast in San Diego. Easterbrook, a Briton who took the helm on March 1, is the second non-American to take the job. His challenge is to halt a slide in sales around the world. Weakness in France and Germany, which has almost 1,500 restaurants, contributed to a 1.1 percent decline in comparable sales in Europe in the fourth quarter. Britain, France, Russia and Germany together accounted for 67 percent of European revenue in 2013.                McDonald’s said earlier this month it would remake itself after competition from Chipotle, Chick-fil-A and other chains bit into U.S. restaurant sales. Easterbrook has already said McDonald’s USA will switch to chicken raised with fewer antibiotics, putting it more in step with Chipotle and Chick-fil-A. Easterbrook did not take media questions at the event.   In meetings with financial analysts last week, the new CEO called himself an “internal activist” and said he would look at everything that could create shareholder value, including cost cutting and a real estate investment trust but said he had not yet committed to a strategy, analysts said.

730,MCD,McDonald's raising average worker wage to about $10 an hour,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) plans to raise the average pay of about 90,000 U.S. workers to around $10 an hour, but the increase will not benefit workers at the vast majority of the restaurants, because they are operated by franchisees, who make their own wage decisions.  Workers groups said the move by McDonald’s, which is also adding benefits such as paid vacations, fell short of their goals. They planned a nationwide protest for Thursday. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other retailers have introduced entry-level wage hikes in response to frequent worker protests calling for higher pay and better conditions.  McDonald’s, which announced the increases on Wednesday, has been fighting weak traffic and slumping sales in the United States. The pay increase, for workers at roughly 1,500 company-owned U.S. restaurants, will take effect on July 1. Starting wages at the restaurants will move to $1 above the locally mandated minimum wage. The increase will take the average hourly rate for those workers to $9.90 on July 1, up from $9.01 currently, McDonald’s said.  By the end of 2016, McDonald’s said, the average hourly wage rate for McDonald’s employees at those restaurants will exceed  $10. Almost 90 percent of McDonald’s more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants are operated by franchisees, who set pay and benefits for their own workers. But the expectation is they will  face pressure to follow suit to stay competitive as employers. McDonald’s also said that full- and part-time crew employees at company-operated restaurants, with at least one year of service, will begin to accrue personal paid time-off. Workers said the company does not currently offer paid time-off. Beyond that, some employees at both company- and franchise-run stores will be eligible for education assistance. “We know that a motivated workforce leads to better customer service, so we believe this initial step not only benefits our employees, it will improve the McDonald’s restaurant experience,” Steve Easterbrook, who became McDonald’s chief executive on March 1, said in a statement.      The wage move quickly drew criticism. “This is too little to make a real difference, and covers only a fraction of workers,” Kwanza Brooks, a McDonald’s worker from Charlotte, North Carolina, who earns $7.25 per hour, said in a statement.  Brooks is part of the union-supported “Fight for $15” movement, which is calling on employers to more than double wages above the federal minimum wage of $7.25. The group plans a nationwide protest at McDonald’s restaurants on Thursday. Shares of McDonald’s, whose annual profit and revenue fell last year, were essentially flat at $96.29 in extended trading. The wage increase at McDonald’s company-run restaurants could force franchisees to follow. In turn, that could cause  those franchisees to raise food prices to cover higher labor costs.  That could benefit McDonald’s because it collects royalties from franchisees based on sales. But, it also could squeeze franchisee profits and threaten the company’s Dollar Menu, which is popular with the chain’s core base of lower-income diners. Bigger sales from price increases means more revenue to McDonald’s Corp, which could solve some of the company’s problems and make Easterbrook look like he is fixing things, said Richard Adams, a former McDonald’s franchisee who now consults for current ones. “They’ll try to paint this as altruistic,” said Adams. “It’s not as nice as it sounds.” ",4012015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-minimumwage/mcdonalds-raising-average-worker-wage-to-about-10-an-hour-idUSKBN0MS5A220150401

Bigger sales from price increases means more revenue to McDonald’s Corp, which could solve some of the company’s problems and make Easterbrook look like he is fixing things, said Richard Adams, a former McDonald’s franchisee who now consults for current ones. “They’ll try to paint this as altruistic,” said Adams. “It’s not as nice as it sounds.”   (Reporting by Lisa Baertlein, additional reporting by Edwin Chan in San Francisco; Editing by Chris Reese, Jonathan Oatis and Steve Orlofsky)",4012015,http://www.reuters.com/article/mcdonalds-minimumwage/update-4-mcdonalds-raising-average-worker-wage-to-about-10-an-hour-idUSL2N0WY29120150401

735,MCD,McDonald's wage plan renews debate on independence of franchisees,"NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s announcement that it will raise the average pay at its company-operated U.S. restaurants threatens to complicate an ongoing labor dispute that turns on whether McDonald’s can be held responsible for the labor violations of its franchisees.  The decision to hike wages to around $10 an hour will affect only 90,000 of the roughly 750,000 McDonald’s restaurant workers in the United States, because almost 90 percent of McDonald’s restaurants are run by franchisees. The International Franchise Association said on Thursday the move to raise wages was a “reminder” that McDonald’s and its roughly 12,500 franchised restaurants are not “joint employers.” The question of whether they are is at the center of closely watched cases before the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in which McDonald’s has been accused by the agency’s attorneys of intimidating workers who participated in union organizing and in a national protest movement calling for higher wages. Steve Caldeira, president of the International Franchise Association, a trade group that represents franchisors including McDonald’s and KFC parent Yum Brands Inc, said the wage plan demonstrates independent decision-making by franchisees separate from McDonald’s. “If the franchisees want to also raise the wages of their employees, they have every right as independent business owners to make decisions that allow them to hire and retain the best employees in the local markets where they operate,” Caldeira said in a statement on Thursday. But some worker advocates downplayed the significance of the wage decision to the NLRB proceedings. The wage decision is not enough to show that franchisees are independent, said Catherine Ruckelshaus, general counsel of the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit in New York that advocates for workers and has criticized McDonald’s. She said the questions before the NLRB are different than simply wage levels. “McDonald’s is pretty unique in terms of its control over its franchisees. It micromanages, controlling things like when workers clock out and clock in, thanks to their technology,” Ruckelshaus said. The technology includes a computer system that tracks the number of burgers sold and calculates whether a franchisee should take a worker off the clock to keep labor costs in check.  Karen King, the chief people officer at McDonald’s, said it would not be appropriate for the company to make a recommendation on wages to franchisees. “Some may follow. Some may not. We can’t dictate what they do in the wage arena,” King told Reuters in an interview. King said the NLRB cases did not figure into the McDonald’s wage move. A NLRB administrative law judge is presiding over the NLRB cases, and a consolidated trial is scheduled to begin in May. The NLRB attorneys have argued that Illinois-based McDonald’s and the franchisees should be held jointly responsible because corporate policies and franchise agreements have a major impact on working conditions. McDonald’s has denied the allegations. Any decision by the judge, Lauren Esposito, is expected to be appealed to the five-member board and, ultimately, to federal courts. The outcome of the proceedings could have wide-ranging implications for franchise businesses and other types of employers. The decision to raise wages probably does put some pressure on franchisees to do the same, said Sara Senatore, restaurant analyst for Bernstein Research, a Wall Street research firm. She said that fast-food chains such as McDonald’s compete for workers with each other and with retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, which this month raised worker wages. “Market forces in this case are going to be pretty powerful. Franchisees are small-business people. Ultimately, they’re going to do what’s dictated by the competitive environment,” Senatore said.

739,MCD,McDonald's raising average worker wage to about $10 an hour,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) plans to raise the average pay of about 90,000 U.S. workers to around $10 an hour, but the increase will not benefit workers at the vast majority of the restaurants, because they are operated by franchisees, who make their own wage decisions.  Workers groups said the move by McDonald’s, which is also adding benefits such as paid vacations, fell short of their goals. They planned a nationwide protest for Thursday. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other retailers have introduced entry-level wage hikes in response to frequent worker protests calling for higher pay and better conditions.  McDonald’s, which announced the increases on Wednesday, has been fighting weak traffic and slumping sales in the United States. The pay increase, for workers at roughly 1,500 company-owned U.S. restaurants, will take effect on July 1. Starting wages at the restaurants will move to $1 above the locally mandated minimum wage. The increase will take the average hourly rate for those workers to $9.90 on July 1, up from $9.01 currently, McDonald’s said.  By the end of 2016, McDonald’s said, the average hourly wage rate for McDonald’s employees at those restaurants will exceed  $10. Almost 90 percent of McDonald’s more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants are operated by franchisees, who set pay and benefits for their own workers. But the expectation is they will  face pressure to follow suit to stay competitive as employers. McDonald’s also said that full- and part-time crew employees at company-operated restaurants, with at least one year of service, will begin to accrue personal paid time-off. Workers said the company does not currently offer paid time-off. Beyond that, some employees at both company- and franchise-run stores will be eligible for education assistance. “We know that a motivated workforce leads to better customer service, so we believe this initial step not only benefits our employees, it will improve the McDonald’s restaurant experience,” Steve Easterbrook, who became McDonald’s chief executive on March 1, said in a statement.      The wage move quickly drew criticism. “This is too little to make a real difference, and covers only a fraction of workers,” Kwanza Brooks, a McDonald’s worker from Charlotte, North Carolina, who earns $7.25 per hour, said in a statement.  Brooks is part of the union-supported “Fight for $15” movement, which is calling on employers to more than double wages above the federal minimum wage of $7.25. The group plans a nationwide protest at McDonald’s restaurants on Thursday. Shares of McDonald’s, whose annual profit and revenue fell last year, were essentially flat at $96.29 in extended trading. The wage increase at McDonald’s company-run restaurants could force franchisees to follow. In turn, that could cause  those franchisees to raise food prices to cover higher labor costs.  That could benefit McDonald’s because it collects royalties from franchisees based on sales. But, it also could squeeze franchisee profits and threaten the company’s Dollar Menu, which is popular with the chain’s core base of lower-income diners. Bigger sales from price increases means more revenue to McDonald’s Corp, which could solve some of the company’s problems and make Easterbrook look like he is fixing things, said Richard Adams, a former McDonald’s franchisee who now consults for current ones. “They’ll try to paint this as altruistic,” said Adams. “It’s not as nice as it sounds.” ",4022015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-minimumwage/mcdonalds-raising-average-worker-wage-to-about-10-an-hour-idUSKBN0MS5A220150402

742,MCD,"Mom sneaks kids to Mickey D’s amid fast-food backlash, won’t tell Dad","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Carolin Wood, an artist and graduate student from Brooklyn’s trendy Greenpoint neighborhood, has a secret that she keeps from her husband and some foodie friends. Once a month, she takes her two young children to McDonald’s for inexpensive breakfasts or ice cream. “We call it our ‘sneaky meal’ because my husband thinks it’s absolutely disgusting,” said Wood, 35. “He doesn’t want to know anything about it.” Even though Wood has fond memories of her own childhood visits to McDonald’s, that doesn’t mean she thinks the food is healthy. At home, she buys organic milk and meat as often as a tight family budget allows. The fact that young mothers like Wood are teaching their children not to tell their dads that they’ve been to McDonald’s may underscore how hard it may be for the world’s largest restaurant chain to remake its image and revive U.S. sales. To lure back consumers, McDonald’s Corp’s new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook recently pledged to eliminate chickens fed human antibiotics at its U.S. restaurants. That won’t make a difference for Wood, who said she’s never eaten a Chicken McNugget and has no plans to try one, even after the antibiotic change. McDonald’s didn’t comment for this story. The company doesn’t break out what percentage of its customers are young adults and/or mothers.  “There is still a negative health connotation,” said Morningstar restaurant analyst R.J. Hottovy. “It can be fixed, but it isn’t an easy fix.” Hottovy said he expects McDonald’s to eventually turn around its business, but not within the next couple years. McDonald’s shares fell 30 cents to $96.55 on Thursday. The shares are down 1.8 percent from a year ago, compared with a 11.7 percent gain by the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the same period. Sixty percent of American adults would like more restaurants to serve antibiotic-free meat, according to a recent Reuters/Ipsos survey of 1,364 participants. Among parents with children under the age of 18, 40 percent said they would be more likely to take the kids to McDonald’s if it had antibiotic-free chicken on the menu. The Reuters/Ipsos online poll was conducted between March 27 and 30, roughly two weeks after McDonald’s announced its plan for antibiotics in chicken. According to another poll by Morgan Stanley of 3,000 U.S. adults, the cohort known as Millennials, generally defined as being 18 to 34 years old, care more about all-natural and organic ingredients than older generations.  Millennials also are more likely than other groups to eat out on a weekly basis. And while they still eat more traditional fast food than other generations, they express more dissatisfaction with the category, according to the Morgan Stanley poll. That helps explain why chains like Chick-fil-A and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, which have committed to sourcing 100 percent antibiotic-free meats, have been taking a bite out of McDonald’s sales. More than one-third of parents who answered the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they take their children to McDonald’s at most a few times a year. A series of critical documentaries over roughly the last decade, including “Super Size Me” in 2004, amplified consumer concerns about the health effect of eating fast food.  McDonald’s has repeatedly tried to change that image. Among other things, it introduced salads to its menu and tweaked its Happy Meals for children by adding apple slices and cutting the french-fry portion by more than half. Last year, McDonald’s sought direct feedback from its U.S. diners with an online campaign called “Our food. Your questions.” Frequent queries included “Is ‘pink slime’ in a Chicken McNugget?” and “Why doesn’t your food rot?”  Food industry experts have said the move toward mostly antibiotic-free chicken will accelerate similar efforts by other fast-food chains and major supermarkets. It may also help curb the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs that contribute to thousands of U.S. deaths every year. Samantha Trujillo, 33, a stay-at-home mother of four from Yuma, Arizona, said McDonald’s vow to wean chickens off most antibiotics makes her feel a little bit better about the chain and its food. “I probably would eat the chicken a little more often,” said Trujillo, who takes her kids out every month or two to get Happy Meals and visit the air-conditioned play area for a respite from Arizona’s sweltering heat. Asked whether McDonald’s antibiotic move could move the needle for the company that saw 2014 revenue, profit and traffic fall, Mark Kalinowski, restaurant analyst for Janney Capital Markets, said: “My best guess is that it’ll help only a little bit at most.” People who care about antibiotic-free meats want them to be completely antibiotic free, Kalinowski said. “If you’re going to do it, do it. Don’t be half pregnant.” Amanda Libby, 46, a mom from Danvers, Massachusetts, agreed.  She used to take her two sons for Happy Meals fairly regularly during baseball season, something she now regrets after seeing films like 2011’s “Forks Over Knives,” which says that many common diseases can be prevented by avoiding processed foods. She now only occasionally allows her boys to eat McDonald’s hamburgers, and would like the chain to use 100 percent antibiotic-free meats before making more frequent trips. “Mostly (antibiotic-free) won’t cut it for me,” said Libby.

Millennials also are more likely than other groups to eat out on a weekly basis. And while they still eat more traditional fast food than other generations, they express more dissatisfaction with the category, according to the Morgan Stanley poll. That helps explain why chains like Chick-fil-A and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, which have committed to sourcing 100 percent antibiotic-free meats, have been taking a bite out of McDonald’s sales. More than one-third of parents who answered the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they take their children to McDonald’s at most a few times a year. A series of critical documentaries over roughly the last decade, including “Super Size Me” in 2004, amplified consumer concerns about the health effect of eating fast food.  McDonald’s has repeatedly tried to change that image. Among other things, it introduced salads to its menu and tweaked its Happy Meals for children by adding apple slices and cutting the french-fry portion by more than half. Last year, McDonald’s sought direct feedback from its U.S. diners with an online campaign called “Our food. Your questions.” Frequent queries included “Is ‘pink slime’ in a Chicken McNugget?” and “Why doesn’t your food rot?”  Food industry experts have said the move toward mostly antibiotic-free chicken will accelerate similar efforts by other fast-food chains and major supermarkets. It may also help curb the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs that contribute to thousands of U.S. deaths every year. Samantha Trujillo, 33, a stay-at-home mother of four from Yuma, Arizona, said McDonald’s vow to wean chickens off most antibiotics makes her feel a little bit better about the chain and its food. “I probably would eat the chicken a little more often,” said Trujillo, who takes her kids out every month or two to get Happy Meals and visit the air-conditioned play area for a respite from Arizona’s sweltering heat. Asked whether McDonald’s antibiotic move could move the needle for the company that saw 2014 revenue, profit and traffic fall, Mark Kalinowski, restaurant analyst for Janney Capital Markets, said: “My best guess is that it’ll help only a little bit at most.” People who care about antibiotic-free meats want them to be completely antibiotic free, Kalinowski said. “If you’re going to do it, do it. Don’t be half pregnant.” Amanda Libby, 46, a mom from Danvers, Massachusetts, agreed.  She used to take her two sons for Happy Meals fairly regularly during baseball season, something she now regrets after seeing films like 2011’s “Forks Over Knives,” which says that many common diseases can be prevented by avoiding processed foods. She now only occasionally allows her boys to eat McDonald’s hamburgers, and would like the chain to use 100 percent antibiotic-free meats before making more frequent trips. “Mostly (antibiotic-free) won’t cut it for me,” said Libby.

744,MCD,UPDATE 1-Yum's upmarket China diner seeks recipe for revival,"(Adds link to TV feature) By Adam Jourdan SHANGHAI, April 11 (Reuters) - Dimmed lights and colonial-style balconies give little indication that trendy Shanghai eatery Atto Primo is part of global fast-food giant Yum Brands Inc, owner of the KFC and Pizza Hut brands. Overlooking Shanghai’s iconic riverside Bund and rubbing shoulders with the city’s most expensive venues, the restaurant is what Yum calls a “lab” where it studies Chinese diners as it looks to bounce back from a lengthy slump in its top market. “A high-end test kitchen will let Yum test the waters with new menus and concepts and get feedback from more sophisticated diners - helpful if you want to go a bit upmarket,” said Ben Cavender, principal at China Market Research Group. Yum’s same-store sales at its nearly 7,000 restaurants in China, the firm’s biggest market for revenue and profit, fell 16 percent in the last quarter of 2014, dragged down by back-to-back food scares, rising local competition and a sense its main KFC brand may have fallen out of touch with China’s consumers. The restaurant is “an innovation lab to help us learn more about the evolving tastes of Chinese consumers”, Yum spokesman Jonathan Blum said in emailed comments to Reuters. He added it would help test recipes to be used at Yum’s China outlets. For Yum, a China turnaround is vital. New CEO Greg Creed said last month that reviving sales in the country was “priority number one, two, and three”. “This new development shows someone has advised them that they’ve got to try something different,” said Michael Griffiths, Shanghai-based analyst with market research firm TNS. With its fancy crystal, high prices and murals influenced by 16th century Italian painters, Atto Primo’s ties to Yum are almost invisible: its only link to Yum is a brief mention in a U.S. regulatory filing. The high-end diner isn’t the only new strategy for Yum in China, where it is planning to build 700 new fast-food stores overall this year. CEO Creed said the firm aimed to rival Starbucks Corp with more coffee offerings in China. However, analysts say Yum is suffering “brand fatigue” in the country. Its image has been hurt by the food scares, which raised doubts over its supply chain, and competition is rising. Tang Yenan, a 29-year-old architect in Shanghai, said he used to eat often at KFC about 15 years ago when it seemed “fancy and new” and was seen as a safe and clean alternative to local options. “Now I don’t have KFC so often, because I have so many other choices,” he said. McDonald’s Corp has also been stung in China by food scares, but moves to upgrade stores and roll out its McCafe concept have helped offset the damage, analysts said. Nonetheless, both brands have lost some ground as more nimble local rivals have tempted cost-conscious diners with healthier-sounding, homegrown fare. Online chatter about the two brands - both good and bad - has stalled on China’s influential Sina Weibo. Such a trend would normally cause some concern among marketers that brands are struggling to stay totally relevant to younger audiences. Yum has seen its share of China’s nearly 800 billion yuan ($129 billion) fast-food market fall over the last few years, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Meanwhile, McDonald’s has edged up slightly, despite major investment.

745,MCD,McDonald's relations with franchisees hit new low: survey,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s (MCD.N) relations with its U.S. franchisees have hit a fresh low as the fast-food giant’s new chief executive fights to turn around its domestic business amid fierce competition, according to a survey released Wednesday. Relations “are the worst I have ever seen!” said one of the 32 franchisees participating in the monthly survey, published by Janney Capital Markets restaurant analyst Mark Kalinowski. “The suits in Oak Brook still don’t get it,” another franchisee said, referring to the company’s top executives. The respondents represent about 1 percent of McDonald’s U.S. franchisees and operate about 215 of the company’s more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants.  McDonald’s spokeswoman Lisa McComb, who noted the poll size, said the company values franchisee feedback and has a “solid working relationship with them.”    Franchisees’ survey responses were based on a scale, with 1 being “poor” and 5 being “excellent”. The average rating of the franchisee/corporate relationship  came in at 1.48, a historical low and down from the historical average of 2.1. Franchisees’ six-month business outlook rating fell to 1.81, meaningfully below the 2.8 survey’s historical average, Kalinowski said. McDonald’s franchisees recently gathered in Las Vegas for closed-door meetings with the parent company. That event, dubbed the “Turnaround Summit”, marked the official debut of Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook. “I came away from the summit completely confused,” said another franchisee. “McDonald’s management does not know what we want to be.”     Respondents also said McDonald’s Corp’s plan to raise wages in the roughly 1,500 restaurants it operates puts pressure on franchisees, who say they cannot afford do follow suit. “It will just strain an already-tenuous relationship,” another franchisee said.     Fast-food workers from McDonald’s and other chains on Wednesday are participating in the latest in a series of national protests calling for higher pay and better working conditions. Franchisees also questioned McDonald’s plan to sell custom burgers at a time when the chain’s large menu is slowing service. The custom sandwich program, called “Create Your Taste,” forces franchisees to spend more than $100,000 per restaurant and even then does not offer it through drive-thru windows. “The Turnaround Summit was a farce. The ideas presented - such as Create Your Taste - DO NOT fit our business model,” said the franchisee who complained about “the suits” in Oak Brook. McDonald’s biggest problems are its “unwieldy menu ... and trying to be all things to all people,” that franchisee added.

747,MCD,"RPT-INSIGHT-Union spends big on low-wage campaign, endgame unclear","(Repeating story for additional subscribers without changes to text) By Nathan Layne and Lisa Baertlein April 15 (Reuters) - Tens of millions of dollars and counting. That’s how much the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has spent so far on a three-year campaign to improve the plight of low-wage retail and fast-food workers, an analysis of public filings shows. The money, which has gone to labor groups, lawyers and others involved in the effort, has provided financial firepower for a movement that has made surprising progress in its push for lifting wages, successfully making the issue part of the public conversation. In recent months, cities have passed or introduced laws to require higher minimum wages within their boundaries. Wal-Mart Stores and McDonald’s Corp, among a number of big employers, have raised minimum pay. And on Wednesday, organizers say, tens of thousands of people will fan out across 200 U.S. cities in the biggest rally since the campaign got its start in late 2012. But the union’s critics are focused on another number: zero. That’s the tally of fast-food workers who have joined SEIU’s membership rolls since the campaign began. And with McDonald’s and other deep-pocketed fast-food chains determined to fight back any attempts at unionization, organizing the industry is an objective that even labor advocates warn might not be achievable. The lack of organizing success to date has led some to ask whether the union should continue spending large sums to better the lives of workers who are unlikely to become members. One SEIU organizer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said members would get “restless” if progress on boosting membership wasn’t evident after a few years. U.S. fast-food workers have been notoriously difficult to organize due to high turnover and a fragmented industry structure. Most outlets are independently operated by franchisees and have generally been considered legally separate from the parent chain. That means organizing efforts would have to be waged restaurant by restaurant. “The SEIU is on a failed mission,” said Rick Berman, a powerful lobbyist for the tobacco, alcohol and food and beverage industries, who is using his groups such as the Center for Union Facts (CUF) to oppose SEIU and low-wage workers. “Most of these fast-food strikes are the equivalent of a Potemkin village.” Mary Kay Henry, president of the SEIU, which has nearly 2 million members, disagrees, saying  the McDonald’s and Wal-Mart pay hikes have helped shift the balance of power toward workers. She said pundits and business groups had underestimated the movement’s impact on wages and was doing so again on its prospects for unionizing low-wage workers. “We are quite confident there will be a breakthrough in having the union recognized as part of this growing movement,” she told Reuters. “We think a settlement in fast-food would be catalytic for other kinds of workers in the service sector, like Wal-Mart, like home care workers, like childcare workers, like workers at airports all across this nation.” The SEIU wouldn’t say exactly how much it has spent in its efforts on behalf of low-wage workers. But the Employment Policies Institute (EPI), a research arm of Berman’s CUF, estimates the union has spent some $50 million on an array of local worker committees, lawyers and consultants that have worked on a broad campaign to help low-wage workers, including efforts to influence legislation at the state and city level. Of that total, Reuters was able to independently verify in SEIU’s annual filings $24 million allocated to 8 worker organizations whose stated purpose, as cited in labor department filings or online job advertisements, was to work for better conditions in the fast-food and retail industries. That compares to the approximately $28 million the union put toward getting Barack Obama elected president in 2008. SEIU’s annual report showed a pattern of increased spending last year. For instance, outlays to the Fast Food Workers Committee, one of the worker organizations, more than doubled to $3.8 million, while public relations firm Berlin Rosen took in $1.3 million, up from around $850,000 in 2013. Henry said the SEIU in the United States is following examples set in Australia and Denmark, where unionized fast-food workers have hammered out labor agreements. The union here faces well-funded opposition on myriad fronts, however, something that was not as big a factor in the other countries. The National Restaurant Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which are among the roughly two dozen business groups to have opposed raising the minimum wage, together spent $342.4 million to lobby U.S. lawmakers from 2012 to 2014, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics’ OpenSecrets.org. Groups such as Berman’s CUF fight the fast-food industry’s public relations battles. And, the International Franchise Association, which represents large franchisors and franchisees, is flexing its political muscle as well. Still, Sarita Gupta, executive director at Jobs With Justice, a worker advocacy group involved in the “Fight for 15” campaign, said worker groups will continue to target state and city efforts to improve pay and working conditions for workers whether or not they are in unions. She cited as an example a bill introduced in Connecticut, co-sponsored by the local SEIU chapter, that would fine large employers who fail to pay at least $15 per hour. For SEIU the question of whether it can turn fast-food workers into dues-paying members is nevertheless important. Critics say failure to make gains quickly could raise doubts among the more highly skilled workers whose dues are financing the campaign. SEIU’s Henry brushed aside such critiques, saying union members were solidly behind the movement and seeing tangible benefits. She pointed to the Los Angeles Unified School District and Johns Hopkins Hospital among employers who had agreed to a $15 an hour wage floor in recent negotiations with SEIU members. “Frankly I’m not worried about it,” she said.

750,MCD,"McDonald's Japan sees wider losses this year, plans restructuring","TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese unit of McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) forecast deeper losses this year and said it would renovate 2,000 stores while closing underperforming outlets, as it struggles to bring back customers after a series of food safety scandals. The company’s woes have also been exacerbated by a shortage of french fries in 2014 due to a U.S. ports dispute, while competition from rivals has only intensified with convenience stores in particular offering broader ranges of ready-made meals and low-priced coffee. McDonald’s Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd (2702.T) said it expects an operating loss of 25 billion yen ($210 million) for the year to end December, more than three times the loss it made last year.     Revenue is expected to slide 10 percent to 200 billion yen, its seventh straight year of decline. It said it was aiming for a return to profit in 2016, helped by a plan to close 131 outlets this year that do not show long-term growth prospects. The company, which has about 3,100 stores currently, will renovate about 2,000 over the next four years. In addition, it aims to shed about 100 headquarter jobs through early retirement and will also seek about 12 billion yen in cost cuts by reducing materials, distribution and overhead costs. McDonald’s Japan was hit last year after a major Chinese supplier of chicken was found to have been in breach of food safety standards. It ran into further problems in January when some customers found foreign objects, including a tooth, in their food. Same-store sales slid a record 38.6 percent in January compared with the same month last year, and dropped about 29 percent in February and March. Row Imamura, a company executive, said he expects same store sales to turn positive in the fourth quarter of this year. McDonald’s Japan reported its 2014 results in February but did not give its customary earnings guidance at the time. Shares of McDonald’s Japan are down about 11 percent from last year’s peak set in June. The stock closed down 1 percent before Thursday’s announcement.

The company’s woes have also been exacerbated by a shortage of french fries in 2014 due to a U.S. ports dispute, while competition from rivals has only intensified with convenience stores in particular offering broader ranges of ready-made meals and low-priced coffee. McDonald’s Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd said it expects an operating loss of 25 billion yen ($210 million) for the year to end December, more than three times the loss it made last year. Revenue is expected to slide 10 percent to 200 billion yen, its seventh straight year of decline. It said it was aiming for a return to profit in 2016, helped by a plan to close 131 outlets this year that do not show long-term growth prospects. The company, which has about 3,100 stores currently, will renovate about 2,000 over the next four years. In addition, it aims to shed about 100 headquarter jobs through early retirement and will also seek about 12 billion yen in cost cuts by reducing materials, distribution and overhead costs. McDonald’s Japan was hit last year after a major Chinese supplier of chicken was found to have been in breach of food safety standards. It ran into further problems in January when some customers found foreign objects, including a tooth, in their food. Same-store sales slid a record 38.6 percent in January compared with the same month last year, and dropped about 29 percent in February and March. Row Imamura, a company executive, said he expects same store sales to turn positive in the fourth quarter of this year. McDonald’s Japan reported its 2014 results in February but did not give its customary earnings guidance at the time. Shares of McDonald’s Japan are down about 11 percent from last year’s peak set in June. The stock closed down 1 percent before Thursday’s announcement.

752,MCD,McDonald's Japan sees wider losses this year after food scandals,"TOKYO, April 16 (Reuters) - The Japanese unit of McDonald’s Corp said on Thursday it expects its losses to widen this year as it struggles to bring back customers after a series of food safety scandals. The company also announced turnaround measures including  plans to renovate stores, close underperforming outlets and cut costs. McDonald’s Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd forecast an operating loss of 25 billion yen ($210 million) in 2015, following a loss of 6.71 billion yen last year. The average estimate of two analysts was a loss of 7.95 billion yen, according to a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll.

753,MCD,"UPDATE 1-What to Watch in the Week Ahead and on Monday, April 20","(Adds events for Verizon, AT&T;, Canadian National Railway and Rogers Communications) Week Ahead A slew of Dow 30 companies report results in the week: Chemicals conglomerate DuPont, industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp, property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies Inc and wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday; McDonald’s Corp, AT&T; Inc, Boeing Co and Coca-Cola Co on Wednesday; and diversified manufacturer 3M Co, Procter & Gamble and Microsoft Corp on Thursday. While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc’s first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will keep an eye out for details on Verizon’s upcoming mobile video service and capital expenditure range and will look for updates on AT&T;’s proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirectTV, which is under regulatory review. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s new CEO, is charged with reviving the company’s falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M’s first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy. Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google’s future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again. Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street’s expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world’s largest social network’s business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets. Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company’s next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram. Investors will be looking out for the company’s outlook for the remainder of 2015. On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices. On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines. Analysts and investors will be looking out for any details on the tax-free sale of its Alibaba shares. General Motors Co reports first-quarter results before the market opens on Thursday. Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before. On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts’ average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer’s flagship smartphone. Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from Qualcomm. The chipmaker had also warned that “challenges” with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China. Qualcomm recently came under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners to spin off its chip business from its patent-licensing business. Credit Suisse reports earnings for the first three months of 2015 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Friday the Swiss bank will ask shareholders to sign off in a symbolic vote on executive pay for 2014, when Credit Suisse became the largest bank in decades to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes. Investors will focus on existing home sales on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 3.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. Also, data for new home sales is expected to be released on Thursday. On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department releases data for durable goods. Starbucks Corp reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. Starbucks is one of the restaurant industry’s top performers, but investors and analysts worry that its streak of red-hot growth is coming to an end. The company has a variety of plans in place to boost sales (adding booze, smoothies, more lunch and dinner options, improving and expanding tea selections and testing delivery) and investors will be looking for proof that those are working. On Tuesday, Yum Brands Inc will report its first-quarter results. Yum’s China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from the latest food scandal in its biggest market. Analysts say the company is suffering from “brand fatigue” in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is slated to announce results for the first quarter on Tuesday. Chipotle is still having problems finding pork suppliers to replace the one it suspended for running afoul of its animal welfare rules. The company says customers have simply switched to other meats and that it isn’t losing sales - but investors will be on alert for any signs of a slowdown. Drugmaker Biogen Inc is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Friday, driven by strong sales of its top-selling oral MS drug, Tecfidera, which has seen burgeoning sales since its launch in 2013. Biogen, which leads the United States multiple sclerosis market with five drugs for the condition, recently reported promising data for its Alzheimer’s drug. Investors will also be looking for commentary on Tecfider’s growth expectations, and potential for competition, as well as the longer-acting MS injectable Plegridy. AbbVie Inc, whose planned $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics Inc is meant to lessen the company’s dependence on its blockbuster Humira arthritis drug, is expected to report sharply higher earnings and sales for the first quarter on Thursday, fueled by Humira’s continuing growth and sales of the company’s recently approved Viekira Pak treatment for hepatitis C. Investors will be keen for details on sales prospects for Viekira Pak, given steep price discounts AbbVie has given to compete with Gilead Science Inc’s potent treatments for the liver disease. Eli Lilly and Co is expected to report higher first-quarter earnings on Thursday as the Indianapolis drugmaker begins to recover from patent expirations that slashed demand for its biggest products. The company is well positioned to deliver a promised return to profit growth this year, helped by new treatments for cancer and diabetes and growing sales of its animal health brands. Abbott Laboratories will report its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Recovering sales of Abbott Laboratories’ infant formulas, following costly recalls in Asia, and improving performance of the company’s branded generic medicines, are expected to drive quarterly earnings growth despite the negative impact of the stronger dollar. Ebay Inc is expected to report results for the first quarter largely in line with Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. The company has seen strong growth in payments business as well as its non-auction e-commerce business. Analysts expect that the company will continue to benefit from the rise in demand for mobile devices, as consumers increasingly use their smart phones and tablets to shop online. Investors will look for details on the company’s plans for the spinoff of PayPal scheduled for the second half of 2015. On Thursday, Dow Chemical Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit due to a stronger dollar and a slowdown in its agricultural business. The company last month said it would offload a bulk of its low-margin bleach and vinyl-related business to Olin in a $5 billion. Investors will be looking for further comments on the company’s cost-saving plans. Johnson Controls Inc, the auto parts supplier and maker of climate control systems for buildings, is expected to report higher second-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by higher sales in its seating and interiors business as auto sales and production rose in the first quarter. The company’s buildings efficiency business, which provides air conditioning equipment and building management services, is also expected to report higher revenue as U.S. office vacancy rate declined to its lowest level since the third quarter to 2009. Investors will be looking for comments on Johnson Controls’ business focus and outlook following the sale of its workplace solutions business to CBRE Group. Pentagon’s No. 1 arms supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, reports first-quarter results on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin has been focusing on increasing sales to commercial customers in United States as well as international governments to make up for pressures from tight U.S. defense spending. Lockheed gets 17 percent of its revenue from international markets and 1 percent from U.S. commercial customers. Investors will be looking to see if Lockheed still expects U.S. military spending to meaningfully pick up this year. Weapons maker Raytheon Co has increased exposure to international markets, which account for about 27 percent of its total sales, as U.S. defense spending remains tight. The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system forecast disappointing 2015 revenue in January as domestic orders remained weak. When the company will report its first-quarter results on Thursday, investors will be looking for an update on a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that Raytheon expected to win in the first quarter. On Tuesday, Omnicom Group Inc, the No. 1 U.S. advertising company, is expected to report first-quarter results largely in-line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Omnicom had warned that a strong dollar would hit revenue this year. Omnicom, whose clients include Apple, McDonald’s and Adidas, gets a little less than half of its revenue from outside the United States. On Friday, Interpublic Group of Companies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ average estimate according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company’s previous quarter was helped by higher ad spending by businesses in the United States. On Tuesday, chipmaker Broadcom Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect the company’s connectivity business to sequentially decline as it comes off a strong Apple-driven fourth quarter. Analysts will be looking for the company to provide outlook for the quarter ending June. On Wednesday, data storage company EMC Corp is expected to report first-quarter profit and revenue below analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had in January forecast a lower-than-expected profit for 2015 and said it would cut jobs. The company, which earns nearly half of its revenue from international markets, is expected to be hurt by a strong dollar. Analysts say enterprise storage demand has been mixed in quarter which may hurt EMC. Virtualization software maker VMware Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ estimate on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, hurt by a stronger dollar. More than 48 percent of VMware’s revenue comes from outside the United States. Analysts at Wells Fargo estimate a negative impact of 3-4 percent from foreign currency on license revenue growth. Programmable chip maker Xilinx Inc will report fourth-quarter results after markets close on Wednesday. The company, which dominates the programmable chip market along with Altera Corp, is expected to report profit and revenue that are largely in line with analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will look for updates on sales to the broadcast, consumer and automotive end market and sales to communications and data center customers. PulteGroup Inc’s first-quarter results are expected to be released on Thursday. Coming on the heels of larger peer D.R. Horton’s second-quarter results on Wednesday, PulteGroup’s results are expected to provide further evidence of a strong spring selling season this year, suggesting that a slowdown in housing starts in the first three months did not point to underlying weakness in the U.S. housing market. Steelmaker Nucor Corp will report first-quarter results on Thursday. Nucor has been struggling with lower selling prices due to high levels of imports. Declining oil prices have also led to excess inventory in Nucor’s pipe and tube business. Analysts will be looking for comments on inventory, steel demand and overcapacity in its steel mills business. On Thursday, Patterson-UTI Energy Inc, the second-largest land driller in North America, is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit as weak oil prices weigh on drilling activity. Patterson, which halved its rig construction program for this year, had warned that 2015 would be “challenging,” having received indications that customers could terminate a number of longer-term contracts early. Investors will be looking for updates on further cost saving measures and commentary on contracts and dayrates for its 16 new high-tech Apex rigs, which analysts believe could help the driller boost cash margins this year. Contract driller Nabors Industries Ltd, which is merging with C&J; Energy, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as drilling activity continues to be hurt by the fall in oil prices. The company has already warned of weak activity and pricing pressure in its international operations. Investors will be looking for updates on any job cuts and the company’s plans to idle rigs in an oversupplied market. On Tuesday, coal miner Arch Coal Inc is expected to report a ninth straight quarterly loss and on Thursday, coal miner Peabody Energy Corp is expected to report a wider first-quarter loss due to continued weakness in coal prices. Kimberly-Clark Corp, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, is expected to report better-than-expected first-quarter sales, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, helped by growing demand in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and South Africa. However, higher input costs and a stronger dollar could have hurt profit. The company said in February it would transfer pension obligations to two insurers to reduce risk and will take a charge in the second quarter. It had also warned of an 8-9 percent drop in 2015 sales hurt by the dollar and weak demand for core products such as Huggies diapers. Investors will be looking for any updates on forecast on Tuesday. Hershey Co, the maker of Hershey’s Kisses and Reese’s peanut butter cups, has been struggling with high cocoa and dairy costs and intense competition from rivals such as Mondelez and Mars. To tackle growing competition, the company has been pouring money in advertisements and promotions, but this is expected to hurt its full-year earnings per share by 2 percentage points. It has also tried to diversify and add a new stream of revenue by acquiring jerky maker Krave Pure Foods Inc in January, marking its first foray into meat snacks. When the company will report its first-quarter profit on Thursday, investors will be looking out for comments on whether the company will make more acquisitions in the meat and bakery snacks category, which are becoming more popular than candy, and the effect of the strong dollar on its outlook. Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc will report its first-quarter results on Thursday. Investors will be looking at how much Boston’s record snowfall hurt results at Dunkin Brands, whose Dunkin’ Donuts shops are concentrated in the U.S. northeast. Experts say the impact could be meaningful. Under Armour Inc, a sports apparel and footwear maker, is expected to report profit and sales for the first quarter in line with analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect Under Armour to continue its 19-quarter streak of reporting more than 20 percent growth in revenue, helped by expanded offerings in sport and outdoor clothing, strong demand for its Speedform Apollo running shoes, new launches in basketball footwear and sponsorship deals. The company is also expected to benefit from investments in its fast-growing digital platform and from the acquisitions of fitness tracking apps Endomondo and MyFitnessPal. When the company will report on Tuesday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and color on the performance of new launches in footwear. Hanesbrands Inc, the innerwear and apparel maker is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts are projecting first-quarter sales growth of more than 15 percent as the company benefits from higher sales of sport and gym clothing at department stores, and the acquisition of DBApparel and Maidenform Brands. When the company reports on Thursday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and more color on the company’s recent acquisition of college logo clothing maker Knights Apparel. Ingersoll-Rand Plc, the maker of Trane air conditioners and Thermo King refrigeration units, is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by growth in global industrial and construction markets. Investors will be looking for the impact of a strong dollar on the company’s industrial business, which has a higher proportion of revenue coming from outside the United States. Investors will also be looking for an update on how much the weakness in oil prices has hurt the company’s newly acquired centrifugal compression business. Xerox Corp, which has been shifting its focus to IT services from making printers and copiers, is expected to report first-quarter revenue that is slightly below analysts’ estimate on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Xerox had cut its profit forecast for 2015 for the second time after reporting its sixth-consecutive drop in revenue last quarter. In December, the company agreed to sell its IT outsourcing arm to Atos. Teck Resources Ltd, Canada’s largest diversified miner, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as prices for both copper and steel-making coal remain depressed amid a fall in demand. The company in March denied media reports that it was in talks to merge with Chilean copper producer Antofagasta. Teck CEO also refuted speculations of a possible merger with HudBay Minerals or an acquisition of Zaldivar, a copper mine owned by Barrick Gold. Teck said in February it might reduce its dividend in July if the industry-wide production cuts fail to boost coal prices. Investors will be interested in any comments of a possible merger or acquisition and demand for steel-making coal. Car seat maker Lear Corp is expected to report higher first-quarter profit on Friday helped by strong demand in North America and a rise in vehicle production. Some analysts expect Lear to benefit from cheaper commodity prices and report higher margins. Investors will look for Lear’s comments on Mercato Capital seeking a split of the auto parts suppliers businesses. Investment bank and asset manager Lazard Ltd reports first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Lazard is expected to benefit from a jump in corporate dealmaking, which should have boosted its M&A; advisory business. Globally, deals worth $811.8 billion were announced in the first quarter, up 21 percent, compared to a year earlier. Among them, Lazard advised on the merger of Heinz-Kraft and the sale of Serbia’s state-operated Telekom Srbija. However, analysts expect lower-than-anticipated deal completions to weigh on the company’s quarterly revenue. Lazard has been focusing more on asset management to be less reliant on financial advisory fees. AutoNation Inc, the largest U.S. car dealer chain, reports first-quarter results on Wednesday. Investors will be watching margins on new car sales, any potential expansion moves and for any concerns about U.S. consumer spending going forward. On Thursday, Qlik Technologies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on higher demand for its data analytics software. The company had forecast full-year adjusted profit below analysts’ average estimate and its revenue forecast was also largely below Wall Street estimates. Touchscreen chipmaker Synaptics Inc is expected to report third-quarter profit below analysts’ estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on weak demand from smartphone makers. Analysts have said that certain Samsung designs that have come out recently are not using Synaptics touch IC products. Online music streaming service provider Pandora Media Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts’ average estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company is expected to benefit from stronger listening hours and its gradual move into automobiles, where more than half of all radio listening occurs in the U.S. Investors will look for updates on user and local ad growth. On Wednesday, specialty mattress maker Select Comfort Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, halting a run of four straight quarters where sales beat expectations. Investors will be looking out for the company’s Sleep Number mattress sales as well as for any changes in full-year outlook. The company provided 2015 profit forecast below estimates in February. On Friday, Apigee Corp, which develops software to manage web applications, is expected to raise up to $92 million in its IPO, valuing the company at about $523.8 million at the higher end of its IPO price range. The company’s software platform allows businesses to design and deploy application programming interfaces (API) to link its core IT systems with data used by customers, others. The company primarily offers application interface management and predictive analysis services. On Tuesday, Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver will present the annual federal budget for the fiscal year that began on April 1, the last budget before the general election scheduled for October. He has promised a balanced budget and has pledged to introduce balanced budget legislation as well. The Conservative government has already introduced a package of tax cuts and family benefits, and infrastructure spending, that has soaked up much of the anticipated surplus. A decline in oil prices has cut much of the remaining room for maneuver. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has ruled out major stimulus spending, arguing that despite cheap oil the economy was still growing. On Thursday Mexico’s national statistics office will release economic activity data for February, after the gauge expanded in January on a pickup in services and agriculture while industry sank. Also on Thursday, Mexico will release annual inflation data for the first half of April, after the indicator picked up to 3.14 in March, reaching just above the central bank’s 3 percent target. Retail sales data released on Friday will reveal how the gauge fared in February, after it rose at its fastest pace in over a year in January. Monday, April 20 International Business Machines Corp is expected to report lower revenue for the 12th straight quarter, as it exits unprofitable businesses and attempts to move into cloud-focused areas, away from its traditional hardware and consulting services foundation. Net profit for the first quarter is expected to rise slightly. Morgan Stanley is expected to report a rise in first-quarter earnings. The company’s institutional securities business now depends more on equities trading business, rather than fixed income trading. Rival Goldman Sachs’s strong performance in stock trading in the first quarter puts the spotlight on Morgan Stanley. The bank has also been focusing more on its wealth management business. It is trying to squeeze more revenue out of its major businesses by getting wealth clients to use investment banking and trading services. Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, who helped execute a sweeping cost-cutting strategy across several business lines at the bank, will step down to join Google as its finance chief next month. Halliburton Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit, hurt by soft drilling activity. Oil producers have significantly scaled back spending amid weak oil prices. However, cost cuts and continued strength in the Middle East and Asia are expected to help the oilfield services provider minimize the effects of the oil downturn. The company has said it would cut more than 6,000 jobs and investors will seek details about any further cost cuts, especially after Schlumberger cut 11,000 more jobs. Halliburton is looking to complete its $35 billion-acquisition of smaller rival Baker Hughes, which is expected to report its own first-quarter results on Tuesday. Investors will want to know about more potential asset sales after Halliburton said earlier it would sell three businesses to pave the way for regulatory clearance for the deal. Investors will also look to see if the deal will help it better cope with pricing pressure from oil producers. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, the world’s second-largest cruise operator by revenue, is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales below analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had forecast revenue below expectations, citing a strong dollar and weak pricing in the Caribbean. Investors will be looking out for any changes in full-year forecast and comments on the Caribbean market, as well as updates on expansion in Europe and Asia. Toymaker Hasbro Inc will report first-quarter results before the bell. The sequels of “Jurassic Park” and “The Avengers” in first half of 2015 and the new “Star Wars” movie in December are expected to boost Hasbro’s sales this year and keep it growing at a faster pace than larger rival Mattel Inc’s. Canadian National Railway reports its financial results for the first quarter. On average, analysts are expecting earnings to rise to 85 Canadian cents a share from 66 Canadian cents a year earlier, as revenue increases to C$3.04 billion. The company may discuss its safety record and the costs associated with its recent string of derailments as cleanup continues near the town of Gogama, in northern Ontario.  Rogers Communications Inc, Canada’s largest wireless phone provider and a major cable and media company, reports results for the first quarter. The company has lost ground in wireless and other subscriber metrics in recent quarters but has been able on average to charge its customers more, a trend investors will be eager to appraise.

754,MCD,"McDonald's recipe for success may need focus on consumers, workers","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - As McDonald’s Corp prepares yet another plan to revive its business, company watchers have the following advice: reconnect with lower income consumers who remain faithful to the brand, improve wages and ease the financial burden on operators. Steve Easterbrook, the company’s new chief executive, on May 4 will announce his plan to reinvent McDonald’s as a “modern, progressive burger company” that is more responsive to global diners’ increasing demand for fresh, less processed and more customized food.  The company signaled its plan for a fresh start after reporting another quarter of disappointing financial results. It declined to provide further details ahead of the announcement. Easterbrook has helped forge previous restructuring plans at the world’s largest hamburger chain. They include simplifying complicated menus, flattening management structure, closing hundreds of underperforming restaurants and removing important human antibiotics from its chicken production.      Faith Popcorn, founder and CEO of marketing consulting firm BrainReserve, would like to see McDonald’s embrace the lower-income consumers that account for a big share of its diners and employees.  “They should be the champions of the 99 percent,” said Popcorn, who has worked with McDonald’s in the past and advised some of the best known U.S. consumer brands, including Coca-Cola Co and Campbell Soup Co. She advised the company to take concrete steps, such as serving healthier fast food and encouraging franchisees to follow McDonald’s corporate leadership to raise wages for restaurant crew members. U.S. franchisees in a recent survey said their relations with McDonald’s Corp had hit a new low. They called on the company to implement changes to help their bottom lines.  The franchisees, who operate nearly 90 percent of McDonald’s U.S. restaurants, worry the company is trying too hard to be all things to all people. They called on management to significantly downsize the menu and rethink a plan for custom burgers that they worry will be labor-intensive and expensive. One franchisee also called for cost relief.      “Nothing would ignite owner/operators more than lower rent and service fees,” said the franchisee, whose identity was not revealed. McDonald’s rivals such as Wendy’s Co and Burger King have boosted their financials by selling virtually all their restaurants to franchisees.   McDonald’s could make a similar move by increasing the percentage of its global franchised restaurants to 90 percent from 80 percent, said RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer. “We believe that the management gets it,” Palmer said, adding that the question is how long it will take to turn the ship.

755,MCD,Stocks end stronger as investors look beyond mixed earnings,"(Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended stronger on Wednesday as Visa’s potential expansion into China and talk of a turnaround at McDonald’s helped investors look beyond a mixed bag of quarterly earnings. All of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors rose, with the tech index gaining 1.09 percent, propelled by Visa and MasterCard.  Visa ended 4.07 percent higher at $68.01 after hitting a record high of $69.98, while MasterCard closed up 3.91 percent after China said it would open up its market to foreign firms for clearing domestic bank card transactions. McDonald’s surged 3.13 percent after it said it was working on a plan to reverse its shrinking sales.  A week ago, more than 80 percent of the S&P; 500 companies to have posted their March-quarter earnings had beaten estimates. But with 121 reports now in, that number has slipped to 71.9 percent - just above the 70 percent earnings beat rate seen over the past four quarters. Many have blamed misses on revenue on a strong dollar for making their products more expensive overseas.     “We’re sorting through earnings.

757,MCD,"McDonald's recipe for success may need focus on consumers, workers","LOS ANGELES, April 22 (Reuters) - As McDonald’s Corp  prepares yet another plan to revive its business, company watchers have the following advice: reconnect with lower income consumers who remain faithful to the brand, improve wages and ease the financial burden on operators. Steve Easterbrook, the company’s new chief executive, on May 4 will announce his plan to reinvent McDonald’s as a “modern, progressive burger company” that is more responsive to global diners’ increasing demand for fresh, less processed and more customized food. The company signaled its plan for a fresh start after reporting another quarter of disappointing financial results . It declined to provide further details ahead of the announcement. Easterbrook has helped forge previous restructuring plans at the world’s largest hamburger chain. They include simplifying complicated menus, flattening management structure, closing hundreds of underperforming restaurants and removing important human antibiotics from its chicken production. Faith Popcorn, founder and CEO of marketing consulting firm BrainReserve, would like to see McDonald’s embrace the lower-income consumers that account for a big share of its diners and employees. “They should be the champions of the 99 percent,” said Popcorn, who has worked with McDonald’s in the past and advised some of the best known U.S. consumer brands, including Coca-Cola Co and Campbell Soup Co. She advised the company to take concrete steps, such as serving healthier fast food and encouraging franchisees to follow McDonald’s corporate leadership to raise wages for restaurant crew members. U.S. franchisees in a recent survey said their relations with McDonald’s Corp had hit a new low. They called on the company to implement changes to help their bottom lines. The franchisees, who operate nearly 90 percent of McDonald’s U.S. restaurants, worry the company is trying too hard to be all things to all people. They called on management to significantly downsize the menu and rethink a plan for custom burgers that they worry will be labor-intensive and expensive. One franchisee also called for cost relief. “Nothing would ignite owner/operators more than lower rent and service fees,” said the franchisee, whose identity was not revealed. McDonald’s rivals such as Wendy’s Co and Burger King  have boosted their financials by selling virtually all their restaurants to franchisees. McDonald’s could make a similar move by increasing the percentage of its global franchised restaurants to 90 percent from 80 percent, said RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer. “We believe that the management gets it,” Palmer said, adding that the question is how long it will take to turn the ship.

McDonald’s global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months fell a worse-than-expected 2.3 percent in the first quarter, and the company warned of another drop in April.  Net income tumbled 32.6 percent to $811.5 million, and revenue was down 11 percent at $5.96 billion. Easterbrook plans to unveil his plan for turning McDonald’s into a “modern, progressive burger company” on May 4. “Folks hoping for a near-term rise in the stock may be hanging their hat on hopes that McDonald’s can spark some pizzazz in investors that day,” Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Mark Kalinowski wrote in a note.

He has already has said McDonald’s USA would switch to chicken raised with fewer antibiotics, putting it more in step with rivals. Other plans include the debut of a new “premium” sirloin burger as well as tests of custom sandwich toppings, all-day-breakfast and salad bars.  McDonald’s is battling on myriad fronts.

766,MCD,Tyson Foods plans to cut human antibiotics in U.S. chicken flocks by 2017,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc, the largest U.S. poultry producer, plans to eliminate the use of human antibiotics in its chicken flocks by September 2017 - one of the most aggressive timelines yet set by an American poultry company. The Arkansas-based chicken and meat giant also said it is working on ways to curtail such on-farm drug practices at its other protein businesses, which include pork and beef. The move marks the latest push by the livestock and food industries to reduce the use of antibiotics crucial to human health in meat production.  Authorities are concerned that the routine feeding of antibiotics to animals could spur the creation of antibiotic resistant superbugs in humans, creating a health hazard. Tyson’s move, announced on Tuesday morning, aims to help the company meet a deadline recently outlined by McDonald’s Corp. to have its U.S. restaurants gradually stop buying chicken raised with human antibiotics over the next two years.  But the company, a key chicken supplier to McDonald’s, said in a statement to Reuters that its plans are part of an ongoing effort and “go beyond one customer.” Tyson said it is also forming working groups with independent farmers, company suppliers, veterinarians and others to talk about how to develop ideas to cut the use of antibiotics vital to fighting human infections in its U.S. beef, pork and turkey supply chains. The working groups will begin meeting this summer. While veterinary use of antibiotics is legal, controversy has grown over the routine feeding of antibiotics that are important to humans to otherwise healthy chicken, cattle and pigs in a bid to stave off disease and help the animals grow more quickly. Tyson said it has already stopped using all antibiotics in its 35 broiler hatcheries and has cut human antibiotics used to treat its broiler chickens by more than 80 percent since 2011. The company said it requires a veterinary prescription when antibiotics are used on its broiler farms. “Given the progress we’ve already made reducing antibiotics in our broilers, we believe it’s realistic to shoot for zero by the end of our 2016 fiscal year,” Donnie Smith, president and chief executive of Tyson Foods, said in a statement. Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Pilgrim’s Pride Corp., the nation’s second-largest U.S. poultry processor, would cut all antibiotics from a quarter of its chicken production by 2019. Rival poultry processor Perdue Farms Inc. told Reuters more than 95 percent of the chickens it produces are raised without antibiotics approved for human use, and more than half are raised with no antibiotics of any kind.  Sandwich chain Chick-fil-A in 2014 gave its producers five years to meet its commitment to go antibiotic-free for chicken. Perdue is a major supplier to Chick-fil-A. Tyson has been working with livestock drug companies and others to test a variety of alternatives to antibiotics to protect birds, ranging from probiotics to essential oils derived from plant extracts, the company told Reuters. However, alternatives to human antibiotics are also needed for treating ill birds, the company said. It is providing funds to help accelerate research into disease prevention and antibiotic alternatives to be used on farms. Tyson declined to say how much the company will spend to buch such funding of livestock pharmaceuticals and alternatives.  Some poultry industry experts say the options for non-human drugs to treat certain diseases in broiler chickens can be limited, and say animal pharmaceutical firms have been slow to invest for the development of new chicken-only antibiotics. Tyson said it plans to meet its 2017 antibiotic-withdrawal timeline, but there could be some exceptions. “We won’t jeopardize animal well-being just to get there,” Smith said. “We’ll use the best available treatments to keep our chickens healthy, under veterinary supervision.” ",4282015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tyson-foods-antibiotics/tyson-foods-plans-to-cut-human-antibiotics-in-u-s-chicken-flocks-by-2017-idUSKBN0NJ0NL20150428
767,MCD,McDonald's tests custom burger program with drive-thru option,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), working to revive U.S. sales amid fierce competition, is testing “TasteCrafted,” a more modest version of its custom sandwich program that will cost franchisees less to install and can be offered through drive-thru windows. Word of the test, which appears to be a simplified version of McDonald’s “Create Your Taste” customization project, lands just before new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook is scheduled to unveil his corporate turnaround plan on May 4. McDonald’s U.S. restaurant sales have declined for six straight quarters, hobbled by tough competition from more nimble chains such as Wendy’s Co (WEN.O), Chick-fil-A and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N). But McDonald’s own missteps in its top profit market also have led to large and complicated menus that have slowed down service. McDonald’s is trying TasteCrafted in a limited number of restaurants near Atlanta, Portland, Oregon, and Southern California, spokeswoman Lisa McComb said. She declined to give a count of restaurants in the test. As many as 30 McDonald’s restaurants in Central California towns such as Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo are offering TasteCrafted, which allows diners to choose burgers, sandwiches, McWraps and salads in a variety of “chef inspired flavors,” Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a client note. As many as seven more restaurants in Oregon are running the test, said Kalinowski, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “The franchisee investment is small.... From what I know, this could be rolled out nationally in a few months, whereas Create Your Taste would take (two to three) years,” one industry source said in Kalinowski’s note.  The TasteCrafted program offers sandwiches made with beef or chicken, three choices of buns and four different topping flavors: bacon clubhouse, pico guacamole, hot jalapeno and ranch deluxe.

Franchisees have been pushing back against Create Your Taste, a custom sandwich program introduced by McDonald’s  previous CEO. Create Your Taste is being tested in a small number of restaurants in California, Illinois, Wisconsin, Georgia, Missouri and Pennsylvania, McComb said. U.S. franchisees have complained that Create Your Taste will exacerbate already slow service. They also say that the installation price of more than $100,000 per restaurant is not justified, in part because the custom sandwiches are not offered through the drive-thrus that account for more than 60 percent of U.S. restaurant sales.

771,MCD,UPDATE 1-McDonald's fries supplier fined in China for water pollution,"(Adds Simplot statement) SHANGHAI, April 30 (Reuters) - Beijing authorities have fined U.S.-based J.R. Simplot’s China processing unit, which supplies frozen french fries to McDonald’s Corp, 3.92 million yuan ($632,370) for water pollution, state media and Simplot said. A local regulator in Fengtai district of Beijing found that Beijing Simplot Food Processing Co Ltd had been discharging contaminated wastewater that exceeded acceptable levels, the company said in a statement on its China website. “As soon as we discovered the wastewater leaks, we immediately complied with the environmental bureau and took measures to stop the emissions,” it said, adding it was still investigating the matter to stop it happening again. The company did not specify the fine amount. China strengthened its environmental regulations at the start of this year as public anger builds over worsening levels of pollutants that regularly afflict the country’s cities and waterways. The unit, which was set up in China in 1992, is a joint venture in which McDonald’s holds a 5 percent stake, the U.S. fast food giant confirmed in an emailed statement to Reuters. Simplot, headquartered in Idaho, is a global potato supplier for McDonald’s and one of the U.S. chain’s key suppliers. “Simplot has assured us that they have implemented a corrective action plan, and we will continue to hold them accountable for implementation and enhanced procedures for compliance,” McDonald’s said, adding it took the infraction “very seriously.” China will ban water-polluting paper mills, oil refineries, pesticide producers and other industrial plants by the end of 2016, as it moves to tackle severe pollution of the water supply which has left one-third of China’s major river basins and 60 percent of its underground water contaminated. Chinese sales at McDonald’s and Yum Brands Inc’s KFC slumped last year after one of their suppliers, Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd, was forced to suspend operations after an undercover Chinese media report alleged to show workers using out-of-date meat and doctoring production dates.

772,MCD,"OSI cuts 340 workers from embattled Shanghai plant, shutdown looms","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. food firm OSI Group LLC [OSIGP.UL] has cut 340 jobs at its embattled Shanghai plant, which supplied McDonald’s Corp and Yum Brands Inc, bringing the facility close to shutdown, the firm said in a statement on its website on Monday.  OSI’s Shanghai Husi Food Co Ltd plant came under the spotlight in July when an undercover Chinese media report showed workers were using expired meat and doctoring production dates. The scandal, which spread as far as Hong Kong and Japan, sparked a Chinese probe into the firm and dragged down China sales at KFC-parent Yum and McDonald’s, which have both since cut or suspended ties with Aurora, Illinois-based OSI. “Over the past two months, Shanghai Husi has experienced significant financial and customer losses and the authorities’ investigations are still ongoing. It is very unlikely that production will be resumed soon,” OSI said in the statement. It added that a small of number of Shanghai Husi staff would be kept on to assist with the ongoing investigation. “As such, Shanghai Husi cannot be fully shut down at this stage,” the firm added. Yum has fully cut ties with OSI in China, while McDonald’s has suspended its ties with the firm pending the outcome of a Chinese investigation. China is Yum’s biggest market and McDonald’s third largest by outlets. The incident - just one of a series of food safety issues to hit China over the past year - has underlined the challenge of regulating supply chains in China, where food scandals can have a major impact on a firm’s sales and reputation. OSI said it had stated a redundancy program for the Shanghai plant on Monday. A total of 340 staff would be made redundant, including 226 directly employed by Shanghai Husi and a further 114 contractors. “It was our expectation that they could resume their work as soon as possible. Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond our control, this will not be the case,” the firm added.

775,MCD,McDonald's shares poised for big move; bullish bets rise,"NEW YORK, May 1 (Reuters) - Options traders appear poised for a big move in McDonald’s Corp’s shares as the world’s biggest restaurant chain is set to unveil a much-awaited turnaround plan on Monday, and bullish bets have picked up in recent days. McDonald’s shares have struggled in the last year as the company faces consumers’ changing tastes and growing preference for healthier fare over processed fast food. Smaller, nimbler competitors such as Wendy’s Co and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc have been more responsive to those changing tastes. After dismal first-quarter results in April, McDonald’s new chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, said he would soon share details on plans to reinvigorate the company. Bullish options have been bid up in anticipation of the plan. “In stark contrast to the typical post-earnings selloff in implied volatility, McDonald’s options have seen a consistently high bid since the announcement of the turnaround plan,” said Anshul Agarwal, equity derivative strategist at Bay Crest Partners. Implied volatility, a gauge of the risk of large moves in a stock, typically rides up ahead of earnings reports and then collapses once the event is over. For McDonald’s the 30-day implied volatility is at 26.57 percent, or about the highest it has been over the last two years, according to Livevol data. On Friday, the cost of a May weekly straddle in McDonald’s options, a strategy in which a trader buys an at-the-money put option and a similar call option, implies a move of about 4.5 percent in either direction by May 8. This would make for one of the biggest five-day moves for the shares over the last two years. Since April 22, open interest in calls, which are usually used for betting on the shares rising, has increased by a third to more than half a million contracts, compared with a 13 percent rise in puts. For every put contract there are two calls open, the highest this ratio has been favoring calls over the last 52 weeks. Bets on the shares rising above $100 by mid-May and June, have been especially busy, suggesting that investors have high expectations from the company on Monday, Agarwal said. McDonald’s shares, which have risen about 3 percent over the last six, were up 1 percent at $97.75 on Friday on the New York Stock exchange.

778,MCD,"McDonald's reset to change structure, cut costs, boost franchises","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s (MCD.N) new chief executive officer said on Monday he would reorganize business units, sell restaurants to franchisees and cut costs in a bid to turn the fast-food chain into a “modern, progressive burger company.” The anticipated video announcement by CEO Steve Easterbrook left investors hungry for specific details on how the world’s biggest restaurant chain would try to improve consumer perceptions of food quality and slow service.  “I will not shy away from the urgent need to reset this business,” said Easterbrook, who took the helm on March 1, following one of McDonald’s most dismal years on record.     Shares were down nearly 2 percent in premarket trading, and closed 1.7 percent lower at $96.13 on the New York Stock Exchange as investors digested the news. “Judging by the immediate investor reaction, there appears to be more of a ‘prove it’ sentiment among investors, rather than an full embrace of Mr. Easterbrook’s plan,” Miller Tabak & Co analyst Stephen Anderson said in a client note. Easterbrook said McDonald’s will sell 3,500 restaurants to franchisees by 2018, taking global franchisee ownership to 90 percent from 81 percent. McDonald’s prior plan called for selling 1,500 restaurants by 2016. He vowed to remove “cumbersome” management and scour the business for inefficiencies to find about $300 million in net annual savings, most of which will be realized by the end of 2017. Easterbrook also said McDonald’s would return $8 billion to $9 billion to shareholders in 2015. McDonald’s currently organizes its business around major geographic markets: the United States, Europe, and Asia/Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (APMEA). Easterbrook said the new segments, which become effective July 1, will be organized around business similarities.     The U.S. market, which accounts for more than 40 percent of McDonald’s operating income, will continue to be led by Mike Andres. The new “international lead” market will include Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, which make up a total of 40 percent of McDonald’s operating income. It will be led by Doug Goare, current president of McDonald’s Europe. Dave Hoffman, now president of McDonald’s APMEA unit, will lead a new “high-growth” market that includes China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Those countries account for about 10 percent of operating income.  The “foundational” market includes the remaining countries where McDonald’s operates. It will be run by Ian Borden, currently APMEA’s chief financial officer.

779,MCD,McDonald's CEO turnaround plan's missing link: customers,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s new chief executive’s turnaround plan for the fast-food chain included specific financial fixes, but left investors and analysts craving a clear strategy to win back diners and boost sales. Steve Easterbrook, CEO of the Golden Arches since just March 1, said on Monday McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) would restructure into four operating divisions, squeeze out about $300 million in annual cost savings and sell 3,500 restaurants to franchisees. Investors, who had been hoping for concrete plans for addressing competition, service speeds and food quality - both real and perceived, sent McDonald’s shares down 1.7 percent to $96.13.   “It was a presentation designed to get the heat off from Wall Street. It had nothing to do with customers,” said Larry Light, CEO of brand consultancy Arcature. Light was McDonald’s global chief marketing officer from 2002 to 2005, when the company last underwent a major turnaround. Light and other experts said Easterbrook’s initial steps announced on Monday should help, but noted that those one-off efforts are not a fix for slumping sales.  “No consumer has ever made a decision to buy a brand based on the structure and organization of a company,” said Light.    “What is the focus of the brand? What is the need that McDonald’s will satisfy better than the competition?”  Easterbrook, who most recently was McDonald’s global chief brand officer, won kudos for turning around the company’s UK business in a prior role and has vowed to transform McDonald’s into a “modern, progressive burger company.”  Easterbrook told reporters that means a “better McDonald’s” that is more convenient, more enjoyable to visit and offers diners the chance to customize their food. “Modern is meeting needs of consumers today. Progressive is anticipating the needs of our customers tomorrow,” said Easterbrook.  Earlier on Monday, Easterbrook announced a partnership to deliver McDonald’s food to homes and offices in Manhattan. He previously has announced plans to trim and localize menus, to remove important human antibiotics from chickens raised for McDonald’s U.S. restaurants, to raise pay for crew in company-run restaurants and tests of custom sandwiches and all-day breakfast. Easterbrook did not elaborate on those efforts on Monday. “There really wasn’t much there,” Franchise Equity Group founder Richard Adams, a former franchisee who advises current McDonald’s operators, said of Monday’s event. “I wanted to hear more about new products.” Jerry Langley, an executive in residence at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business who had worked in international finance at McDonald’s for 17 years, until 1999, is confident that Easterbrook can turn the ship. “Investors probably wanted something magical, something big, something they hadn’t thought of,” said Langley, who still has a “sizeable position” in McDonald’s stock. “McDonald’s doesn’t work that way, they tend to get back to their knitting and what they do best.” Howard Penney, restaurant analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management, wanted Easterbrook to be bolder. “It doesn’t feel like he’s taking charge. It doesn’t feel like he’s making difficult decisions,” Penney said. As a result, analysts said, the wait-and-see continues. “2015 is clearly a ‘throw-away’ year, and we are not sure how much it will help 2016 yet,” Jefferies restaurant analyst Andy Barish wrote in a client note.

781,MCD,"US STOCKS-Wall Street ends on upbeat earnings from Berkshire, Cognizant","* McDonald’s ends down after revealing turnaround plan * Berkshire gives biggest boost to S&P; * Fracking stocks fall after Einhorn comments * Indexes end higher: Dow 0.26 pct, S&P; 0.29 pct, Nasdaq 0.23 pct   (Updates to close) By Noel Randewich May 4 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended higher on Monday as corporate earnings came in better than feared, although shares of McDonald’s declined after the fast-food chain’s turnaround plan left investors wanting more. Berkshire Hathaway Inc  rose 1.62 percent, giving the biggest boost to the S&P; 500 after the insurance and investment conglomerate’s results beat forecasts. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 46.34 points, or 0.26 percent, to end at 18,070.4, and the S&P; 500  gained 6.2 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,114.49, just shy of its record-high close of 2,117.69 on April 24. The Nasdaq Composite added 11.54 points, or 0.23 percent, to 5,016.93. “This is being driven by a lack of substantial negative news,” said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. “Things in Europe seem pretty calm, we haven’t heard anything out of China, and against that backdrop, some of the earnings reports are looking better.” Cognizant surged 6.15 percent after the IT services provider reported a better-than-expected rise in revenue and raised its full-year forecast. Seven of the 10 S&P; sectors were positive, with the financials index gaining 0.98 percent and the utilities index 0.73 percent higher, with investors attracted by relatively high dividends. With three-quarters of corporate earnings reports in, Wall Street is now trying to divine when the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates. An April payroll report due on Friday could give a hint. While new orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar, a further sign that a rebound in economic growth would not be as strong as last year. Monday’s rally in utilities suggested some investors believe the Fed will not raise rates soon and may be looking for yield, Jankovskis said. The S&P; utilities index has a dividend yield of 3.7 percent, compared to the S&P; 500’s 2.4 percent dividend yield.

Berkshire  rose 1.8 percent, giving the biggest boost to the S&P; 500 after the insurance and investment conglomerate’s results beat forecasts. At 2:20 p.m. the Dow Jones industrial average rose 67.43 points, or 0.37 percent, to 18,091.49, the S&P; 500  gained 8.72 points, or 0.41 percent, to 2,117.01 and the Nasdaq Composite added 18.45 points, or 0.37 percent, to 5,023.84. Eight of the 10 S&P; sectors were positive, with the financials index gaining 0.82 percent and the utilities index 1.1 percent higher. “We just seem to be hanging in an upper range, taking in a rash of earnings and trying to digest if the fundamentals are there to build a platform for us to leg-up from,” said Frank Davis, director of sales and trading at LEK Securities in New York, adding that he is skeptical of current stock prices. With quarterly earnings reports winding down, Wall Street is trying to divine when the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates. An April payroll report due on Friday could give a hint. While new orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar, a further sign that a rebound in economic growth would not be as strong as last year. McDonald’s Corp fell 1.01 percent after its plan to turn the fast-food chain into a “modern, progressive burger company” failed to impress shareholders. Shares of Pioneer Natural Resources Co fell 3.1 percent and the S&P; 500 energy index was 1 percent lower after David Einhorn, the influential head of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, said at a conference that oil fracking companies can “contaminate portfolio returns.” Cognizant hit an all-time high of $65.55 after the IT services provider reported a better-than-expected rise in revenue and raised its full-year forecast.

Eight of the 10 S&P; sectors were higher, with the health index gaining 0.8 percent. The Nasdaq biotech index  was up 0.8 percent. New orders for U.S.-made goods rose a higher-than-expected 2.1 percent in March. Over the past two weeks, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index  has moved an average of 17.79 points daily, wider than the 12.43 point range in early March. The swings have amplified on mixed economic signals. The payroll report for April is scheduled for Friday and about 213,000 jobs are expected to have been added in the month, after an add of 126,000 in March. “The main event this week is the April unemployment numbers and that’s going to be the main driver for the markets,” said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management in New York. Aama, however, reckons that the strong gains in the market in the past few weeks may be erased as a strong jobs number could put a June rate hike back into play. At 11:27 a.m. EDT (1527 GMT ) the Dow Jones industrial average was up 78.54 points, or 0.44 percent, at 18,102.6 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 23.99 points, or 0.48 percent, at 5,029.38.

McDonald’s shares fell 0.5 percent to $97.29 after the company laid out initial plans for lure back customers and boost sales. Cisco inched up 0.3 percent to $29.23 after the company said Chief Executive John Chambers would step down to become executive chairman and 17-year company veteran Chuck Robbins will become CEO, effective July 26. AMC Networks gained as much as 5.8 percent to hit a record high of $80.70 after its profit topped analysts’ expectations as strong demand for its original programming boosted ad sales in its domestic business.

New orders for U.S.-made goods are expected to have risen 2 percent in March compared with a 0.2 percent increase in the prior month. The data is expected at 10:00 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT). The U.S. factory numbers comes after data showed Germany’s manufacturing sector continued to expand in April, while factory activity in China for the month recorded its biggest drop in a year, hardening the case for fresh stimulus from Beijing. Wall Street closed sharply higher on Friday as investors snapped up beaten-down shares and an encouraging batch of data for April pointed to a pickup in the economy. “Now that earnings are winding down, all the focus shifts to the Fed,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. “The markets are stubborn with nothing knocking them down, which frightens me more because you don’t know when the correction will start.” At 9:46 a.m. EDT (1346 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 90.68 points, or 0.5 percent, at 18,114.74, the S&P; 500 was up 10.15 points, or 0.48 percent, at 2,118.44 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 26.94 points, or 0.54 percent, at 5,032.33.

787,MCD,McDonald's Southern California restaurants testing kale,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), which is testing a variety of new food products as part of its turnaround effort, on Wednesday said nine southern California restaurants are trying out breakfast bowls made with what is becoming a state dietary staple: kale.  One of the breakfast bowls is made with turkey sausage, egg white, kale and spinach and the other includes chorizo and egg. Both are priced around $4, McDonald’s spokeswoman Lisa McComb said. Kale, touted as a nutrient-rich “superfood,” over the last five years has been growing in popularity in the United States, both in grocery produce aisles and on restaurant menus.      McDonald’s rivals Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) and other quick-service chains such as Yum Brands Inc’s (YUM.N) Taco Bell over the past few years have helped popularize bowls, which are typically made with meat or another protein, rice or another starch and vegetables.  Separately, Janney Capital Markets analyst Mark Kalinowski  said in a client note on Wednesday that McDonald’s restaurants in Canada will soon begin offering three salads made with kale as an ingredient. McDonald’s declined to comment directly on Kalinowski’s Canada kale news, saying that the company is constantly testing new products.  “We’ll share news on our menu when the time is right,” McComb said. Adding kale to menus would be a significant departure from the norm at the world’s biggest fast-food chain.  Earlier this year McDonald’s aired a burger ad that advised: “All vegetarians, foodies and gastronauts kindly avert your eyes. You can’t get juiciness like this from soy or quinoa.” The ad then flashed to the lettuce on the burger and the announcer said: “Nor will that ever be kale.”  McDonald’s is reworking and trimming its large and complicated menu, which has slowed service and failed to keep pace with growing demand for fresher, less processed food. The company irked critics of its advertising and food with Wednesday’s announcement that it is bringing back its Hamburglar character, which has not been seen on television since 2002. The return of the Hamburglar, now a young suburban father, coincides with McDonald’s limited-time sirloin one-third pound hamburger.   New McDonald’s Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook on Monday unveiled the first steps in the company’s strategy to revive sales, lure back diners and transform the iconic fast-food chain into a “modern, progressive burger company.” That announcement got a cool reception from investors, who are hungry for detailed plans for fixing menus and service speeds.

790,MCD,Wage increases in focus ahead of retail earnings,"(Reuters) - Labor expenses will be a key focus during retailers’ earnings conference calls in the coming weeks, with many companies under pressure to boost workers’ wages at a time when low U.S. unemployment levels have given workers more leverage. Wal-Mart (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N), T.J. Maxx (TJX.N), Gap (GPS.N), and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) have already announced wage increases, and the trend appears to be trickling further into the retail and restaurant sectors. “The competition for that job is tougher for the employer. The employee has choices now,” said Thomas Sudyka, managing director at investment management firm Lawson Kroeker based in Omaha, Nebraska. So far in this reporting season, companies such as Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (BBBY.O) and Buffalo Wild Wings Inc BWLD.O have discussed wage pressure, while Pier 1 Imports Inc (PIR.N) plans incentive pay for the first time in three years.  Fast-food workers have been vocal in fighting for better wages. They rallied in U.S. cities on April 15 to demand higher pay, using the deadline for filing tax returns to publicize their argument that they cannot survive on the hourly wages paid by many U.S. corporations. The U.S. government said Friday U.S. job growth rebounded last month and the unemployment rate dropped to a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent, while average hourly earnings rose three cents in April, a year-on-year gain of 2.2 percent.  Big retailers reporting in the week starting May 13 include Macys Inc (M.N), Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N).  The following week, Home Depot (HD.N), Wal-Mart, Staples Inc SPLS.O, Target and Gap are due to report. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) both report on May 27. Macys, Kohl’s and Home Depot say they set their wages on a market-by-market basis as the competitive situation varies around the country. Kohl’s said it also watches other factors driving employee decisions, such as the work environment and future opportunities for advancement.   Staples in March discussed a 2014 cash build-up for incentive compensation that would be paid out in 2015 but it did not give details. Bed Bath & Beyond said during a conference call early in April it had planned for an additional expense of 6 cents a share this year due to increased compensation. Analysts expect Bed Bath & Beyond to earn about $1.91 per share this year on a fully reported basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  “We are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits beyond what we have always historically planned for, to continue to assure that we preserve our ability to attract, and retain, the best associates,” Sue Lattmann, the company’s chief financial officer told investors. Many companies will try to cut other costs, or raise prices where they can to absorb the extra expense of higher wages, said Lawson Kroeker’s Sudyka. During its quarterly conference call on April 28, Buffalo Wild Wings told investors it faced pressure to raise the salaries of minimum wage workers as well as higher-paid workers. There were also additional labor costs from the creation of new roles aimed at boosting sales.   Chief Operating Officer James Schmidt told investors that “if labor has to be a little higher, but it’s driving higher same-store sales, we would look and try to look at other lines of the (profit and loss statement) where we can recapture that.” Some analysts said investors will likely take wage increases in their stride, as better pay should translate to improved sales, with consumers having more money to spend. “Even if companies can’t pass on the costs, it’s a one-time hit and we can grow from there,” Sudyka said.

791,MCD,Fitch Downgrades McDonald's IDRs to 'BBB+/F2'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 08 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the Issuer Default Ratings  (IDRs) of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) to 'BBB+/F2' from 'A/F1'. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. At March 31, 2015, McDonald's had $14.3 billion of  total debt. A full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. KEY RATINGS DRIVERS Materially Higher Leverage Anticipated The downgrade reflects Fitch's view that McDonald's has become more aggressive  with its financial strategy and also concerns about continued sales declines,  market share losses, and brand strength going-forward. McDonald's plans to  return $8 billion to $9 billion of cash to shareholders via dividends and share  repurchases in 2015 and to achieve the high end of its three-year $18 billion to  $20 billion cash return target by the end of 2016.  Given softness in its business, as evidenced by weak first quarter results,  McDonald's will have to incur substantial debt to satisfy its cash return goal.  Fitch projects that total debt/EBITDA and total adjusted debt/operating EBITDAR  will increase to the low 2.0x and 3.0x range by the end of 2015, up from 1.5x  and 2.6x for the LTM period ended March 31, 2015.  Fitch has taken into consideration the potential for meaningful cash proceeds  and margin accretion from refranchising 3,500 company-operated units by 2018 and  the $300 million of annual net G&A; savings expected by 2017. However, the pace  at which benefits from refranchising will be realized is uncertain, and it is  Fitch's view that management may be willing to maintain higher amounts of  leverage going forward.  Persistently Weak Same-Store Sales Trends During the quarter ended March 31, 2015, McDonald's global SSS were negative  2.3% with declines across all major geographic segments. Global guest counts  fell 4.7%, an acceleration versus the 3.1% decline in the comparable period last  year. McDonald's global SSS have been weak for more than two consecutive years.  Fitch views a cohesive and aggressive system-wide effort to improve service,  emphasize food quality and provide locally-relevant menu variety as necessary  catalysts for SSS growth. However, due to McDonald's significant size, the need  to solidify the support of franchisees and reputational challenges both  domestically and following supply chain issues in Asia, Fitch believes changes  will take time and be challenging to implement and to resonate with consumers.  Efforts in the U.S. include simplifying its menu to improve service and provide  flexibility to address local customer preferences while also introducing new  higher quality food items nationally. In order to appeal to health conscious  consumers, McDonald's announced plans to serve only antibiotic-free chicken in  the U.S. within two years. The company also recently rolled out a new sirloin  burger and is testing a new customizable burger platform in the U.S. called  Taste Crafted. Fitch believes improving the brand's perception in the burger  category could prove challenging given increasing levels of competition from a  growing number of smaller faster growing chains.  Significant Restructuring Under Way  On May 4, 2015, McDonald's new CEO outlined initial steps of his plan to  turnaround performance. The company's first priority is to address operational  issues, but management also plans to continue to evaluate opportunities to  enhance shareholder value. Fitch believes the May 4 announcement provided few  additional specifics on how McDonald's will improve consumers' perception of its  food but instead focused on organizational changes, becoming 90% franchised  globally, and boosting shareholder returns.  McDonald's will realign its business into four market segments to better share  ideas and speed decision making across geographies. Segments include the U.S.,  International Lead Markets (Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K),  High-Growth Markets (China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain,  Switzerland and the Netherlands), and Foundational Markets (the remaining  markets within McDonald's system). In addition, as mentioned previously, the  company also intends to accelerate cash returned to shareholders in 2015,  refranchise 3,500 company units by 2018, and reduce annualize G&A; by $300  million by 2017. Substantial but Declining Cash Flow  McDonald's generates substantial cash flow from operations. However, CFO  declined 11% during the first quarter of 2015, after declining 5% in 2014 to  $6.4 billion due to lower sales and operating income. McDonald's is slowing new  unit growth to focus on regaining sales momentum. 2015 Capex guidance is  approximately $2 billion, down from $2.6 billion in 2014 and a high of $3  billion in 2012. Free cash flow (FCF - defined as CFO less capex less dividends)  remains meaningful, totaling $931 million in 2014 and $490 million in the first  quarter of 2015, but Fitch expects FCF to be deployed towards share buybacks.  Liquidity and Maturities  McDonald's liquidity is supported by its large cash balance, FCF, and an undrawn  revolving credit facility that expires December 2019. At March 31, 2015,  liquidity totaled $4.1 billion and consisted of $1.6 billion of cash and $2.5  billion revolver availability. At the year ended Dec. 31, 2014, debt maturities  approximated $1.1 billion in 2015, $823 million in 2016, and $1 billion in 2017  based on year-end currency rates. Fitch currently expects debt maturities to be  refinanced given McDonald's shareholder friendly activities. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Low single-digit SSS declines continue in the near term; --Margins contract in 2015 but expand meaningfully thereafter due to  refranchising and cost reductions; --Operating cash flow growth does not resume until 2016; --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA and total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR  (defined as total debt plus 8x gross rents-to-operating EBITDA plus gross rents)  approximate the low 2.0x and low 3.0x range in 2015 and declines only modestly  thereafter, assuming no material debt paydown.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --SSS declines accelerate and remain negative beyond 2015; --Margin contraction continues post 2015 due to continued weak operating results  and a slower than expected pace of refranchising; --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA and total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR  sustained above the mid-2.0x and mid-3.0x range, respectively. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --A sustained period of SSS growth; --Margins stabilize or expand significantly due to operating earnings growth or  refranchising; --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA and total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR is  sustained below at or below 2.0x and 3.0x, respectively due to operating income  growth or debt reduction.  Fitch has downgraded McDonald's ratings as follows:  --Long-term IDR to 'BBB+' from 'A'; --Bank credit facilities at to 'BBB+' from 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt to 'BBB+' from 'A'; --Short-term IDR to 'F2' from 'F1'; --Commercial paper to 'F2' from 'F1'.

792,MCD,McDonald's April global restaurant sales dip less than expected,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) reported a smaller-than-expected fall in worldwide sales at its established restaurants in April, thanks to a stronger performance in Europe, sending shares of the company higher in morning trading. Same-store sales at McDonald’s restaurants globally fell 0.6 percent in April, its 11th straight monthly decline. Still, that was less than the 1.8 percent drop expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Same-restaurant sales grew 1 percent in Europe, as gains in the United Kingdom and Germany offset declines in the key markets of France and Russia amid economic volatility in the region.     Shares of the world’s biggest restaurant chain were up 2 percent at $98.72 in morning trading, mirroring a rally in U.S. stocks following data that showed U.S. job growth rebounded last month in a sign the economy was picking up momentum. Sales at the company’s U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months fell 2.3 percent, their third straight monthly decline. The United States is McDonald’s top region for profit and the company said customer visits were down in April. Same-restaurant sales dropped 3.8 percent in McDonald’s Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) business, which includes China, as the company tried to regain its footing following food scandals in China and Japan. Analysts, on average, had estimated a 0.2 percent uptick in Europe, a 2.3 percent drop in the United States and a 5.8 percent decline in APMEA. McDonald’s Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook on Monday announced a plan to reorganize business units, sell restaurants to franchisees and cut costs to turn the fast-food giant into a “modern, progressive burger company.” ",5082015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-sales/mcdonalds-april-global-restaurant-sales-dip-less-than-expected-idUSKBN0NT1AT20150508

795,MCD,Wage increases in focus ahead of retail earnings,"(Reuters) - Labor expenses will be a key focus during retailers’ earnings conference calls in the coming weeks, with many companies under pressure to boost workers’ wages at a time when low U.S. unemployment levels have given workers more leverage. Wal-Mart (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N), T.J. Maxx (TJX.N), Gap (GPS.N), and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) have already announced wage increases, and the trend appears to be trickling further into the retail and restaurant sectors. “The competition for that job is tougher for the employer. The employee has choices now,” said Thomas Sudyka, managing director at investment management firm Lawson Kroeker based in Omaha, Nebraska. So far in this reporting season, companies such as Bed Bath & Beyond Inc (BBBY.O) and Buffalo Wild Wings Inc BWLD.O have discussed wage pressure, while Pier 1 Imports Inc (PIR.N) plans incentive pay for the first time in three years.  Fast-food workers have been vocal in fighting for better wages. They rallied in U.S. cities on April 15 to demand higher pay, using the deadline for filing tax returns to publicize their argument that they cannot survive on the hourly wages paid by many U.S. corporations. The U.S. government said Friday U.S. job growth rebounded last month and the unemployment rate dropped to a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent, while average hourly earnings rose three cents in April, a year-on-year gain of 2.2 percent.  Big retailers reporting in the week starting May 13 include Macys Inc (M.N), Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N).  The following week, Home Depot (HD.N), Wal-Mart, Staples Inc SPLS.O, Target and Gap are due to report. Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) both report on May 27. Macys, Kohl’s and Home Depot say they set their wages on a market-by-market basis as the competitive situation varies around the country. Kohl’s said it also watches other factors driving employee decisions, such as the work environment and future opportunities for advancement.   Staples in March discussed a 2014 cash build-up for incentive compensation that would be paid out in 2015 but it did not give details. Bed Bath & Beyond said during a conference call early in April it had planned for an additional expense of 6 cents a share this year due to increased compensation. Analysts expect Bed Bath & Beyond to earn about $1.91 per share this year on a fully reported basis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  “We are modeling an increase in our investments in compensation and benefits beyond what we have always historically planned for, to continue to assure that we preserve our ability to attract, and retain, the best associates,” Sue Lattmann, the company’s chief financial officer told investors. Many companies will try to cut other costs, or raise prices where they can to absorb the extra expense of higher wages, said Lawson Kroeker’s Sudyka. During its quarterly conference call on April 28, Buffalo Wild Wings told investors it faced pressure to raise the salaries of minimum wage workers as well as higher-paid workers. There were also additional labor costs from the creation of new roles aimed at boosting sales.   Chief Operating Officer James Schmidt told investors that “if labor has to be a little higher, but it’s driving higher same-store sales, we would look and try to look at other lines of the (profit and loss statement) where we can recapture that.” Some analysts said investors will likely take wage increases in their stride, as better pay should translate to improved sales, with consumers having more money to spend. “Even if companies can’t pass on the costs, it’s a one-time hit and we can grow from there,” Sudyka said.

798,MCD,"HIGHLIGHTS-Hedge funds cut eBay, Leonard Green hot on Shake Shack","(Adds Greenlight Capital, Appaloosa Management) By Sam Forgione NEW YORK, May 15 (Reuters) - Top U.S. hedge fund management firms, including Dan Loeb’s Third Point LLC and Farallon Capital Management, trimmed some of their equity exposure in eBay Inc , but kept high positions in the e-commerce company’s shares during the first quarter, according to regulatory filings. Third Point cut its eBay stake by 1 million shares to 9 million, while Farallon reduced its equity position 27 percent to 1.8 million shares. Activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC, however, raised its stake by about 49 percent to 20 million shares during the first quarter. MD Sass Investors Services Inc liquidated its position in eBay, selling 626,520 shares. Leonard Green & Partners LP, one of the nation’s top private equity firms with over $15 billion, revealed on Friday that it held 9.2 million class A shares in Shake Shack Inc as of March 31. Shake Shack shares, which sold at $21 in an initial public offering in January, jumped nearly 10 percent on the news to more than $72 a share, before closing up 5.94 percent at $69.39. Leonard Green also took a new 990,000 share stake in Bed Bath and Beyond Inc. Bed Bath and Beyond shares ended the day up 5.31 percent to $73.35. Top U.S. hedge fund management firms, including Leon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors and Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management, continued to reduce or slash stakes altogether in Apple Inc during the first quarter as shares of the iPhone maker rallied. The actions were revealed in quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, known as 13F filings, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. They are of great interest to investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying. The disclosures are backward-looking and come out 45 days after the end of each quarter. Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions. As a result, the public filings do not always present a complete picture of a management firm’s stock holdings. The following are some of the hot stocks and sectors in which hedge fund managers either took new positions or exited existing stakes in the first quarter. Third Point took a new 3.3 million share stake. David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital took a new stake of 1.7 million shares in one of the world’s top department stores. David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management LP took a new stake of 1.08 million shares. Appaloosa upped its stake by 617,365 shares to 15.3 million shares, while Greenlight Capital took a new stake of 9.5 million shares. MICRON TECHNOLOGY Inc Appaloosa took a new stake of 3.6 million shares and Greenlight raised its stake by 2.3 million shares to 33.5 million. Activist fund ValueAct Capital bought an additional 12 million shares of Halliburton, raising the firm’s stake to 33 million shares. Alyeska Investment Group liquidated its stakes in Halliburton in the first quarter, while Omega Advisors Inc exited its exposure in the previous quarter. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates LP said it opened a new position in Agrium, buying 97,162 shares, while ValueAct trimmed its position by selling 231,893 shares to own 7.9 million. Tiger Veda Management LLC took a new position in solar company SunEdison, buying 274,505 shares. Barry Rosenstein’s Jana Partners raised its stake in the car-rental company by 20 percent to 41.8 million shares. The shares rose as much as 7 percent on Friday after the disclosure in Jana’s filings, as well as Hertz posting its review of first-quarter results at the close on Thursday. The shares closed at $20.60, up 5.3 percent. Omega Advisors took a new position in BofA shares of 650,000 shares. Omega Advisors raised its share stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co by 17.1 percent to 1.1 million shares during the first quarter.

802,MCD,UPDATE 1-SEIU seeks FTC probe of McDonald's and other franchisors,"(Adds confirmation of filing, McDonald’s, SEIU comment) By Lisa Baertlein LOS ANGELES, May 18 (Reuters) - The Service Employees International Union, backer of a three-year campaign to improve the plight of low-wage fast-food and retail workers, on Monday petitioned the Federal Trade Commission to investigate alleged abusive practices by major franchisors, including McDonald’s Corp and 7-Eleven Inc. SEIU’s petition outlined six U.S. franchisor practices it called endemic and “particularly harmful” in the latest salvo in a broad campaign to pressure McDonald’s Corp to improve working conditions and raise wages for restaurant employees, who also are seeking to unionize. The union, which has roughly 2 million members, said those practices include incomplete or misleading financial performance representations, unreasonable capital expenditure demands, retaliation against members of independent franchisee organizations, unfair termination, unfair non-renewal, and interference with transfers or sales. “An FTC investigation could help curb harmful and predatory franchisor practices, giving franchisees space to create good jobs and grow the economy,” said Scott Courtney, assistant to the SEIU’s president. A spokesman for the FTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. McDonald’s spokeswoman Lisa McComb called SEIU’s latest action “ironic,” since the protests it backs have disrupted the restaurant operations of the same franchisees the union now seeks to form an alliance with. “McDonald’s has a strong working relationship with our 3,100 independent franchisees,” McComb said. Still, there appears to discontent in the ranks of McDonald’s franchisees. A small but influential survey published in April suggested that relations between McDonald’s U.S. franchisees and the fast-food giant had hit a new low. Franchisees complained in the anonymous poll that requirements for renovations and other upgrades, such as McDonald’s new “Create Your Taste” custom burger program, burden them with substantial debt. McDonald’s in March got a new chief executive to lead a turnaround of the company’s business, which has weakened due to fierce competition, changing consumer appetites and internal missteps. Franchisor 7-Eleven, owned by Tokyo-based Seven & I Holdings Co, has been hit with lawsuits from franchisees who alleged it invented reasons to take away their convenience stores. A 7-Eleven spokeswoman previously told Reuters those allegations were false. SEIU, which separately is seeking to hold McDonald’s liable for alleged labor violations by franchisees, is backing a proposed law in California that would make it more difficult for franchisors to terminate agreements with franchisees. Last year, California’s governor vetoed a bill that would have helped franchisees recoup some of their business investments when a franchisor wrongly terminates their relationship.

In its petition, reviewed by Reuters and expected to be filed with the FTC on Monday morning, SEIU outlined six U.S. franchisor practices it said appeared endemic and “particularly harmful.” The union, which has roughly 2 million members, said those practices include incomplete or misleading financial performance representations, unreasonable capital expenditure demands, retaliation against members of independent franchisee organizations, unfair termination, unfair nonrenewal, and interference with transfers or sales. Among other things, McDonald’s franchisees have complained that the company’s requirements for renovations and kitchen upgrades have burdened them with substantial debt. Most recently, U.S. franchisees have complained about McDonald’s new “Create Your Taste” customization project. Among other things, they say that it carries a price tag that is too high for a program that does not work in drive-thrus, which account for more than 60 percent of U.S. restaurant sales. McDonald’s, which is also testing a more modest customization program that is available through drive-thru windows, in the past has said it has a “solid working relationship” with its franchisees. Separately, franchisor 7-Eleven, owned by Tokyo-based Seven & I Holdings Co, has been hit with lawsuits in which franchisees alleged that it drummed up reasons to take away their convenience stores. A 7-Eleven spokeswoman previously told Reuters that those allegations were false and that the company ends relationships with the “few franchisees who violate the law or the franchise agreement” to protect other franchisees, employees and customers. SEIU currently is backing a proposed law in California that would make it more difficult for franchisors to terminate agreements with franchisees. Last year, California Governor Jerry Brown vetoed a bill that would have helped franchisees recoup some of their business investments when a franchisor wrongly terminates their relationship.

805,MCD,Los Angeles gives preliminary approval to $15 minimum wage,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Los Angeles City Council voted on Tuesday to increase the minimum wage in the nation’s second-largest city to $15 an hour by 2020 from the current $9, in a victory for labor and community groups that have pushed for similar pay hikes in several U.S. municipalities. The council’s 14-1 vote on the measure, which must come back before the panel for final approval, would require businesses with more than 25 employees to meet the $15 pay level by 2020, while smaller businesses would have an extra year to comply. Officials said the plan, which comes on the heels of similar minimum wage hikes in other major cities including Seattle and San Francisco, would increase pay of an estimated 800,000 workers in the city. “We are embarking upon, I think, the most progressive minimum wage policy anywhere in the country,” City Councilman Curren Price Jr., one of the main backers of the proposal, said before the vote. With the federal minimum wage stagnant at $7.25 an hour since 2009, labor and religious groups have increasingly pressed local governments in liberal-leaning areas to enact their own minimum wage hikes even as their hopes dim for an increase from the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress.  The proposal given preliminary approval in Los Angeles, where housing costs are among the highest in the nation, represents a far-reaching victory for supporters of higher pay for low-wage workers.   The 67-percent pay increase would be implemented gradually, starting at $10.50 an hour for larger employers in 2016, and gradually going up each year until it reaches $15 in 2020.  Companies with 25 or fewer workers would follow a slightly slower stepped-up increase in minimum wage pay. Opponents of minimum wage hikes, such as Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce senior vice president of public policy Ruben Gonzalez, say they place an undue burden on businesses, and would force employers to lay off workers or move. “There is simply not enough room, enough margin in these businesses to absorb a 50-plus percent increase in labor costs over a short period of time,” he told the city council. Mayor Eric Garcetti, who last year proposed a pay increase that would have brought the minimum wage to $13.25 by 2017, said in a statement that he planned to sign the council’s measure. Other cities have also moved to increase their minimum wages in phases. Seattle is phasing in a pay hike that would bring the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next two to six years, depending on the size of the business. Voters in San Francisco have approved raising their minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2018. The San Francisco Bay Area city of Emeryville has given preliminary approval to gradually increase its minimum wage to $16 an hour by 2019, in what would be the nation’s highest such minimum pay. The city council is scheduled to vote on Tuesday evening on whether to give that final approval. Chicago city leaders last year approved raising its minimum wage to $13 by 2019, and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has called for raising the minimum wage in his city to about $15 by 2019.

806,MCD,Investors have no stomach for long-dated Big Mac,"LONDON, May 19 (IFR) - McDonald’s bit off more than it could chew in the euro corporate bond market on Monday, forcing it to pull the 20-year tranche of a jumbo bond sale after investors failed to show up. But the US fast food outlet was still able to raise EUR2bn, which alongside a US$2bn deal priced later that day, tees up its accelerated share buyback and dividend payment programme of US$8bn-US$9bn this year. While McDonald’s is a frequent issuer in euros, it has previously stuck to issuing no more than EUR500m a time. On Monday, however, it chose to go for a supersize deal, announcing four new tranches, all of benchmark size. This means the firm wanted to raise at least EUR2bn from the bond sale, which was split into a seven-, 12- and 20-year fixed rate tranches alongside a 4.25-year floating rate note. Many in the market said the 20-year was a bold call given the recent chaos in the Bunds market and by late-morning signs emerged that that note was struggling. While overall books had climbed to EUR3.25bn, size expectations on the 20-year had been downsized to EUR300m from EUR500m. By early afternoon leads threw in the towel, pulling the 20-year tranche entirely. Several investors said that they were not surprised. “Long-dated highly-rated paper is still suffering from the flood of issuance we had at the end of February and first half of March,” one said. “Also many of the reverse Yankees are trading wider than where they were issued earlier this year.” A banker on the deal said they had expected the steepness of the proposed curve to help investors get over their reticence for longer-dated paper, with the 20-year mooted at 110bp over mid-swaps compared to 80bp on the 12-year. “The market has been volatile but the long-end isn’t completely dead, which I think shows this was somewhat credit specific,” he said. “They were downgraded on the back of the share buyback and turnaround plan, and I think this meant there were fewer 20-year buyers than we anticipated despite a steep curve for a Single-A credit.” Moody’s, S&P; and Fitch have all downgraded McDonald’s credit rating this month, to A3/A-/BBB+ from A2/A/A. A banker away from the deal said that Monday was not the day to test demand at the long end, however. “On top of all the recent rates volatility, target buyers had been out for a few days and the overall deal size was ambitious for a company that typically issues only EUR500m tranches,” he said. “On the plus side, at least they pulled the tranche instead of shafting the few investors who turned up.” Despite pulling the 20-year tranche, McDonald’s was still able to reach the implied EUR2bn minimum target size through the other three-tranches. The deal was eventually split between a EUR600m 4.25-year FRN at 30bp over three-month Euribor, a EUR800m seven-year fixed at 55bp over mid-swaps and a EUR600m 12-year fixed at 80bp over mid-swaps. This compared to initial price thoughts of 35bp area, 55bp to 60bp, and 80bp area respectively. The banker on the deal said that McDonald’s has to raise US$4bn-US$5bn in the near term to fund the share buyback and refinancing needs, which it has achieved with the new euro and dollar jumbo bonds. McDonald’s also raised US$2bn of five, 10 and 30-year notes. “We got the size we wanted without the 20-year and we were able to juggle around allocations without stretching the book too much, as secondary levels show,” he said. The final book on the remaining three-tranches ended up at EUR3bn. The banker said that the FRN and seven-year tranches were bid 1bp tighter with the 12-year trading flat to reoffer. Active bookrunners on the deal were BofA Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.

807,MCD,"McDonald's, other fast-food workers, protest ahead of annual meeting","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Thousands of McDonald’s workers seeking a minimum wage of $15 per hour swarmed the fast-food giant’s headquarters for the first of two days of protests to coincide with the fast-food chain’s annual meeting on Thursday. Protests by low-wage fast-food and retail workers have helped fuel a national debate about pay levels. Companies such as McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) are raising starting pay and cities like Seattle and Chicago are boosting their minimum wages over time. Tyree Johnson, 47, of Chicago joined thousands of others for noisy but peaceful protests outside McDonald’s headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook on Wednesday. “They keep telling me they value me but they don’t give me more money,” said Johnson, who has worked in McDonald’s restaurants since 1992 and says he lives in a men’s hotel because he can’t afford an apartment on his wage of $8.55 per hour. “We respect their right to peacefully protest,” McDonald’s spokeswoman Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem said. She said the world’s largest restaurant chain regularly looks at the wage issue.    Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s new chief executive, last month announced that starting pay at company-operated restaurants would be set at $1 above the locally mandated minimum wage, beginning on July 1. By the end of 2016, McDonald’s expects the average hourly pay rate to be above $10 per hour.  Those increases only apply to some 90,000 workers at the roughly 1,500 U.S. restaurants McDonald’s operates. They do not affect around 660,000 other restaurant workers employed by U.S. McDonald’s franchisees. Some workers were quick to criticize the announcement, saying it was too little to make a real difference and affected too few workers.  The decision also angered some McDonald’s restaurant operators, who said it would put additional cost pressure on franchisees struggling to maintain profits at a time when sales have been weakened by intense competition and internal missteps that have slowed service.

809,MCD,Sanderson sees no alternatives to antibiotic use in chicken production,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sanderson Farms Inc, the third largest U.S. poultry producer, plans to continue using antibiotics on its birds partly because there are no alternatives on the horizon for treating a deadly but common gut disease, Chief Executive Officer Joe Sanderson said on Wednesday. Other major poultry producers, including market leader Tyson Foods Inc, have announced plans to eradicate antibiotics, which are also crucial in human healthcare, from their flocks but have not ruled out their use on sick birds.  The debate over the agriculture industry’s long-standing practice of using such drugs in livestock production to stave off disease and to promote more rapid growth has heated up in recent years as concerns grow among public health experts and federal regulators that their routine feeding to livestock could create a health hazard by spurring the creation of antibiotic-resistant superbugs in humans. Two of the biggest makers of animal drugs have told Sanderson Farms that developing products to treat the gut disease necrotic enteritis is not profitable enough to justify the effort, the CEO said. Enteritis is treated with antibiotics including virginiamycin and bacitracin. “They just don’t have anything in the pipeline,” Sanderson added. He declined to identify the companies. Sanderson is concerned the birds would suffer and die from the condition without antibiotics. It costs the companies too much money to develop alternative drugs, he said, adding “the market is so small it’s not worth it.” This week, Sanderson Farms sent a letter to its customers, including retailers and export markets, outlining its reasons for using antibiotics in poultry production, Joe Sanderson said. Tyson plans to eliminate the use of human antibiotics in its chicken flocks by September 2017, one of the most aggressive timetables yet set by an American poultry company. Tyson’s move will help the company meet a deadline outlined by McDonald’s Corp for its U.S. restaurants to gradually stop buying chicken raised with human antibiotics over the next two years. Tyson has said it plans to push for accelerated research into disease prevention and antibiotic alternatives on farms. The company “will not let sick animals suffer,” CEO Donnie Smith said last month. Sanderson told investors at a separate conference earlier this month that “there’s no evidence whatsoever that using these antibiotics really does cause antibiotic resistance bacteria,” according to a transcript of the event.

810,MCD,Pension fund leaders challenge McDonald's and others on buybacks,"BOSTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Four U.S. public pension fund officials on Wednesday warned that McDonald’s Corp and other companies may be jeopardizing their own futures by returning excessive amounts of cash to investors via share buybacks. The statement by the fund officials marks the first time in which some of the nation’s biggest institutional investors have joined up to urge companies to rethink their focus on immediate returns and aim for long-term growth. The four officials - New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, Chicago Treasurer Kurt Summers and California Controller Betty Yee - are fiduciaries to pension funds with $860 billion in assets. Yee is on the boards of both the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System. The statement singled out McDonald’s and comes a day ahead of the fast-food chain’s annual shareholders meeting. It said McDonald’s is continuing an “aggressive” share buyback program even as it begins an overhaul of its operations. The drive by the four officials runs counter to calls for more payouts from high-profile activist investors, including some that recently disclosed stakes in McDonald’s, which could set up a clash over how the country’s largest restaurant chain allocates capital.  The pension leaders, in the statement, said that companies’ productivity and wage growth had once matched and helped drive prosperity. “Today, however, 95 percent of corporate earnings are being distributed to shareowners, prompting us to question whether companies are adequately reinvesting for sustainable returns over the long-term,” they said. “If the pendulum swings too far in favor of returning capital to shareowners, the future viability of the companies in which we invest may be placed at risk.” The statement referred to “serious performance challenges” at McDonald’s. McDonald’s Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, who took over the top spot on March 1, earlier this month announced a turnaround strategy that included returning up to $9 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Representatives for McDonald’s were not immediately available to comment on the statement from the pension fund officials. Recent filings showed new shareholders in McDonald’s include activist investors Jana Partners LLC and Corvex Management LP, which have pushed for share buybacks elsewhere. Neither would comment about the restaurant chain. McDonald’s annual meeting on Thursday, at its headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, is to include a shareholder vote on a measure known as “proxy access” that would make it easier for small groups of shareholders to run director candidates. McDonald’s board opposes proxy access and said it could open the door to what it called “special-interest” candidates.  In their statement the four pension fund officials said proxy access would help “hold boards accountable when they place short-term interests ahead of long-term value creation.” Share buybacks have come under increasing scrutiny as academics and politicians criticize them as potentially short-sighted and argue that more profits should be used to shore up companies’ long-term growth and improve wages for employees.  Last year Laurence Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, warned companies against overdoing dividends and buybacks at the expense of future growth. In April, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat of Wisconsin, asked securities regulators to review buyback rules. From 2003 to 2012 S&P; 500 companies used 54 percent of their earnings to buy back stock, or $2.4 trillion, with dividends absorbing another 37 percent of earnings, according to a paper by University of Massachusetts Lowell Professor William Lazonick published in the Harvard Business Review late last year. “That left very little for investments in productive capabilities or higher incomes for employees,” Lazonick wrote. On the other side of the debate, a generation of activist investors have had success pressing companies to step up buybacks and to increase dividends, both meant to boost returns amid a soft economic recovery. Under pressure from billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, for example, Apple boosted its repurchase program in April to $140 billion from $90 billion last year. Icahn this week said he is again pressing to increase that amount.

813,MCD,Los Angeles gives preliminary approval to $15 minimum wage,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Los Angeles City Council voted on Tuesday to increase the minimum wage in the nation’s second-largest city to $15 an hour by 2020 from the current $9, in a victory for labor and community groups that have pushed for similar pay hikes in several U.S. municipalities. The council’s 14-1 vote on the measure, which must come back before the panel for final approval, would require businesses with more than 25 employees to meet the $15 pay level by 2020, while smaller businesses would have an extra year to comply. Officials said the plan, which comes on the heels of similar minimum wage hikes in other major cities including Seattle and San Francisco, would increase pay of an estimated 800,000 workers in the city. “We are embarking upon, I think, the most progressive minimum wage policy anywhere in the country,” City Councilman Curren Price Jr., one of the main backers of the proposal, said before the vote. With the federal minimum wage stagnant at $7.25 an hour since 2009, labor and religious groups have increasingly pressed local governments in liberal-leaning areas to enact their own minimum wage hikes even as their hopes dim for an increase from the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress.

815,MCD,McDonald's CEO gets grilled at first annual meeting,"LOS ANGELES/BOSTON (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) shareholders defied executives at its annual meeting on Thursday, approving a proposal to make it easier to nominate directors to the board of the fast-food chain and taking its new CEO to task over wages, advertising and its food.  McDonald’s Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, who took the helm on March 1, is fighting on numerous fronts as he works to turn around the company, which saw profit and revenue fall in 2014 after service times slowed and nimbler rivals picked off  customers with menus that appeal to growing appetites for fresher, less-processed food.  Despite opposition from McDonald’s, 61 percent of voting shareholders said yes to a proposal that would make it easier for long-term investors to list director candidates on company proxy materials.   The UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust brought the proxy access proposal before investors because “McDonald’s board needs to be more accountable for these performance lapses,” the Trust’s Corporate Governance Director Cambria Allen said at the meeting, which was closed to media but accessible via webcast. Thousands of protesters swarmed McDonald’s headquarters for two days of rallies that are part of a multi-year, union-supported campaign for better wages and working conditions at the world’s biggest restaurant chain. The day before the meeting, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and three other officials who are fiduciaries to large public pension funds challenged McDonald’s and other companies, saying they might be jeopardizing their own futures by returning excessive amounts of cash to investors via the buybacks.  Earlier this month, Easterbrook said McDonald’s turnaround plan would include returning up to $9 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Stringer called proxy access at McDonald’s “the perfect antidote for a board whose turnaround plan prioritizes share buybacks over long-term value creation.” During Thursday’s meeting, activists asked the company to make its actions match its public message. Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Jesse Sharkey called on McDonald’s to “stop pretending to support values for the public good while simultaneously undermining those policies with its political contributions.” The union introduced a shareholder proposal requesting an annual “congruency analysis” of company values and political contributions. It did not pass. While Easterbrook recently announced plans to raise pay for some 90,000 workers in company-run restaurants, Sharkey said the company “simultaneously undermines efforts to raise the minimum wage across the country with large support through the National Restaurant Association (NRA),” a deep-pocketed industry group that lobbies against such increases as well as food policy changes. “McDonald’s is exposing its share owners and business to significant reputational risks by continuing to say one thing and do another,” Sharkey said. Easterbrook told meeting attendees he was proud of the move the company made regarding crew wages in the restaurants it operates. He said the pay of some 660,000 other McDonald’s restaurant workers was up to the franchisees who employ them. He did not address the NRA contributions. Others shareholders, including three nuns, appealed to Easterbrook to take concrete steps toward serving healthier food, moving to sustainable palm oil and cutting important human antibiotics from the production of all of the meats it serves. Casey Hinds of Seattle criticized McDonald’s prior CEO Don Thompson for saying at last year’s annual meeting that McDonald’s was not marketing to schools - despite company fundraising programs such as “McTeacher’s Night.” She warned that continuing the disconnect was hurting the company’s reputation with key customers.          “It’s the kind of disrespect that results in a loss of brand trust and why moms and Millennials are leaving the corporation behind,” said Hinds, a former Air Force pilot who is part of Corporate Accountability International’s Moms Not Lovin’ It network.   “In every market where we do business, we are a responsible advertiser,” said Easterbrook, who added that McDonald’s and its franchisees are committed to giving back to the communities where they do business.

816,MCD,UPDATE 3-McDonald's CEO gets grilled at first annual meeting,"(Adds investor comment, details from meeting) By Lisa Baertlein and Ross Kerber LOS ANGELES/BOSTON, May 21 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp  shareholders defied executives at its annual meeting on Thursday, approving a proposal to make it easier to nominate directors to the board of the fast-food chain and taking its new CEO to task over wages, advertising and its food. McDonald’s Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, who took the helm on March 1, is fighting on numerous fronts as he works to turn around the company, which saw profit and revenue fall in 2014 after service times slowed and nimbler rivals picked off  customers with menus that appeal to growing appetites for fresher, less-processed food. Despite opposition from McDonald’s, 61 percent of voting shareholders said yes to a proposal that would make it easier for long-term investors to list director candidates on company proxy materials. The UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust brought the proxy access proposal before investors because “McDonald’s board needs to be more accountable for these performance lapses,” the Trust’s Corporate Governance Director Cambria Allen said at the meeting, which was closed to media but accessible via webcast. Thousands of protesters swarmed McDonald’s headquarters for two days of rallies that are part of a multi-year, union-supported campaign for better wages and working conditions at the world’s biggest restaurant chain. The day before the meeting, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and three other officials who are fiduciaries to large public pension funds challenged McDonald’s and other companies, saying they might be jeopardizing their own futures by returning excessive amounts of cash to investors via the buybacks. Earlier this month, Easterbrook said McDonald’s turnaround plan would include returning up to $9 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Stringer called proxy access at McDonald’s “the perfect antidote for a board whose turnaround plan prioritizes share buybacks over long-term value creation.” During Thursday’s meeting, activists asked the company to make its actions match its public message. Chicago Teachers Union Vice President Jesse Sharkey called on McDonald’s to “stop pretending to support values for the public good while simultaneously undermining those policies with its political contributions.” The union introduced a shareholder proposal requesting an annual “congruency analysis” of company values and political contributions. It did not pass. While Easterbrook recently announced plans to raise pay for some 90,000 workers in company-run restaurants, Sharkey said the company “simultaneously undermines efforts to raise the minimum wage across the country with large support through the National Restaurant Association (NRA),” a deep-pocketed industry group that lobbies against such increases as well as food policy changes. “McDonald’s is exposing its share owners and business to significant reputational risks by continuing to say one thing and do another,” Sharkey said. Easterbrook told meeting attendees he was proud of the move the company made regarding crew wages in the restaurants it operates. He said the pay of some 660,000 other McDonald’s restaurant workers was up to the franchisees who employ them. He did not address the NRA contributions. Others shareholders, including three nuns, appealed to Easterbrook to take concrete steps toward serving healthier food, moving to sustainable palm oil and cutting important human antibiotics from the production of all of the meats it serves. Casey Hinds of Seattle criticized McDonald’s prior CEO Don Thompson for saying at last year’s annual meeting that McDonald’s was not marketing to schools - despite company fundraising programs such as “McTeacher’s Night.” She warned that continuing the disconnect was hurting the company’s reputation with key customers. “It’s the kind of disrespect that results in a loss of brand trust and why moms and Millennials are leaving the corporation behind,” said Hinds, a former Air Force pilot who is part of Corporate Accountability International’s Moms Not Lovin’ It network. “In every market where we do business, we are a responsible advertiser,” said Easterbrook, who added that McDonald’s and its franchisees are committed to giving back to the communities where they do business. Easterbrook, who has vowed to transform the iconic chain into a “modern, progressive burger company,” also dismissed calls to retire company mascot Ronald McDonald. “Ronald is here to stay,” he said.

817,MCD,"In China, firms flash green credentials as regulators loom","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc is planting trees, Mars may move to ‘zero carbon’ and Foxconn Technology Co Ltd is spending millions of dollars to give its factories a ‘green’ makeover, as companies operating in China face tighter rules on pollution. Beijing introduced tougher regulations this year to combat pollution, keen to overhaul China’s unwanted image of smog-choked cities, fouled waterways and heavy-metal tainted soil. This won’t come cheap; the country’s central bank estimates China will need to spend 2 trillion yuan ($322 billion) a year over the next five years on reducing pollution, and government coffers will only cover about a tenth of that - leaving local and international firms to pick up the rest of the tab. “For companies and factories which need to seriously cut levels of pollutants, it’s going to be extremely costly – we’re talking millions of dollars,” said Philip Cheng, Shanghai-based partner at law firm Hogan Lovells. Harsher penalties were also introduced this year, and local governments - with tougher targets of their own - have been putting more pressure on businesses making anything from chocolate to clothing, China-based executives said. A Beijing regulator last month fined a leading supplier of fries to McDonald’s Corp for water pollution, while the cost of meeting pollution targets for China’s mostly state-owned steel firms has jumped 50 percent on average since last year. “China’s environmental law is becoming one of the strongest in the world,” said Manuel Baigorri, senior director of sustainability at Levi Strauss & Co [LEVST.UL], which is working on a project to use less water and power at its China mills. Apple, which makes the majority of its iPhones in China, said this month it would help plant and protect up to 1 million acres of new forest land in China, and has launched a solar project in southwestern Sichuan province. U.S. chocolate maker Mars said it was in talks with local governments about sustainability, and planned to replicate something similar to a $345 million U.S. wind power project to help makes its operations “carbon neutral”. “There’s a lot of interest and attention in greening the grid and getting more renewables going in China, so it feels like a good time to be working in that direction,” said Mars’ global sustainability director Kevin Rabinovitch. Wal-Mart Stores Inc said it is using energy efficient equipment in its stores, while McDonald’s is “accelerating” work on sustainability in China in line with “government expectations”, a China spokeswoman said. Executives in China noted the new regulations were already driving up costs, especially in high polluting sectors such as energy, natural resources, chemicals, metals and apparel. “We’re definitely seeing the costs related to environmental compliance going up,” said a Shanghai-based executive at a large international chemicals firm. Others added that costs were rising, but were worth paying to stay on the right side of regulators and local governments, often the gatekeepers to business in the world’s second-largest economy. “This can be a competitive advantage for multinational companies, leading the market where the government has quite firmly said it would like it to go,” said David Frey, China-based partner at KPMG. A major question, though, is whether China has the resources to enforce the new rules, especially with local governments torn between growth and environmental protection. Company executives focused on sustainability said directives were coming down from central government, but local authorities often didn’t have the muscle, or the will, to enforce them. “We’re seeing Beijing issue policies pushing factories to reduce water and energy use, but local regulators often don’t have the systems in place to properly implement them,” said a Shanghai-based executive at a global consumer goods firm. The new rules have, though, created business opportunities for firms helping industries reduce waste, and auditor firms are bulking up their Chinese environmental compliance teams to meet demand. Major manufacturing firms such as Apple supplier Foxconn invested around $33.5 million on green projects last year, and said it is looking to improve energy efficiency further in 2015. “Government policies are highly influencing companies to switch to renewables,” said Rosie Pidcock, a Beijing-based business development manager at renewable energy project developer UGE, noting her firm has seen an increase in new business since the tougher rules were announced last year.

822,MCD,RPT-McDonald's shareholders to weigh director-nomination rules,"(Repeats story for wider distribution, no change to text) By Lisa Baertlein and Ross Kerber LOS ANGELES/BOSTON, May 21 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp  shareholders will vote Thursday on a proposal that would make it easier to nominate directors to the board of the fast-food chain, which is in turnaround mode after losing customers and sales to competition and after internal missteps. Investor support for such new director nomination rules, referred to as “proxy access,” is growing. The California Public Employees’ Retirement System (Calpers) and the New York City Pension Funds have urged shareholders to vote for proxy access at McDonald’s, and influential proxy advisory firms Institutional Investor Services and Glass Lewis & Co have recommended that their clients support it. Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc, major investors that hold significant stakes in McDonald’s, have publicly backed proxy access. McDonald’s opposes the proposal, which was filed by the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust. “We believe that making McDonald’s leadership at the board level more accountable to shareholders ensures that the board is the strongest it can be to usher in a new chapter of prosperity for the benefit of the company, its employees, and shareholders,” said Meredith Miller, chief corporate governance officer, UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and three other officials who are fiduciaries to public pension funds with a total of $860 billion in assets are challenging McDonald’s and other companies on stock buybacks. Stringer called proxy access at McDonald’s “the perfect antidote for a board whose turnaround plan prioritizes share buybacks over long-term value creation.” The proxy access thresholds proposed at McDonald’s would allow groups of shareholders holding at least three percent of company stock for at least three years to be able to list director candidates on company proxy materials. That would give longer-term shareholders with limited resources more power to hold directors accountable, Miller said. McDonald’s encouraged shareholders to reject the proposal, which it said is “unnecessary and potentially harmful to the company at this time.” McDonald’s said it has robust corporate governance practices that provide shareholders with the ability to effectively voice their views with the board and vote on critical matters. The vote on the proposal comes shortly after activist hedge fund investors such as Jana Partners LLC and Corvex Management LP disclosed new stakes in McDonald’s. Among other things, experts said activists are unlikely to benefit from the proposal because they tend to be short-term investors.

824,MCD,UPDATE 1-Pension fund leaders challenge McDonald's and others on buybacks,"(Adds McDonald’s comment) By Ross Kerber and Lisa Baertlein BOSTON/LOS ANGELES, May 20 (Reuters) - Four U.S. public pension fund officials on Wednesday warned that McDonald’s Corp  and other companies may be jeopardizing their own futures by returning excessive amounts of cash to investors via share buybacks. The statement by the fund officials marks the first time in which some of the nation’s biggest institutional investors have joined up to urge companies to rethink their focus on immediate returns and aim for long-term growth. The four officials - New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, Chicago Treasurer Kurt Summers and California Controller Betty Yee - are fiduciaries to pension funds with $860 billion in assets. Yee is on the boards of both the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System. The statement singled out McDonald’s and comes a day ahead of the fast-food chain’s annual shareholders meeting. It said McDonald’s is continuing an “aggressive” share buyback program even as it begins an overhaul of its operations. The drive by the four officials runs counter to calls for more payouts from high-profile activist investors, including some that recently disclosed stakes in McDonald’s, which could set up a clash over how the country’s largest restaurant chain allocates capital. The pension leaders, in the statement, said that companies’ productivity and wage growth had once matched and helped drive prosperity. “Today, however, 95 percent of corporate earnings are being distributed to shareowners, prompting us to question whether companies are adequately reinvesting for sustainable returns over the long-term,” they said. “If the pendulum swings too far in favor of returning capital to shareowners, the future viability of the companies in which we invest may be placed at risk.” The statement referred to “serious performance challenges” at McDonald’s. McDonald’s Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, who took over the top spot on March 1, earlier this month announced a turnaround strategy that included returning up to $9 billion to investors through dividends and share repurchases. “McDonald’s is in turnaround mode and that is a business decision our leadership made in balance with other factors,” company spokeswoman Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem said on Wednesday. Recent filings showed new shareholders in McDonald’s include activist investors Jana Partners LLC and Corvex Management LP, which have pushed for share buybacks elsewhere.  Neither would comment about the restaurant chain. McDonald’s annual meeting on Thursday, at its headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, is to include a shareholder vote on a measure known as “proxy access” that would make it easier for small groups of shareholders to run director candidates. McDonald’s board opposes proxy access and said it could open the door to what it called “special-interest” candidates. In their statement, the four pension fund officials said proxy access would help “hold boards accountable when they place short-term interests ahead of long-term value creation.” Share buybacks have come under increasing scrutiny as academics and politicians criticize them as potentially short-sighted and argue that more profits should be used to shore up companies’ long-term growth and improve wages for employees. Last year Laurence Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, warned companies against overdoing dividends and buybacks at the expense of future growth. In April, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat of Wisconsin, asked securities regulators to review buyback rules. From 2003 to 2012 S&P; 500 companies used 54 percent of their earnings to buy back stock, or $2.4 trillion, with dividends absorbing another 37 percent of earnings, according to a paper by University of Massachusetts Lowell Professor William Lazonick published in the Harvard Business Review late last year. “That left very little for investments in productive capabilities or higher incomes for employees,” Lazonick wrote. On the other side of the debate, a generation of activist investors has had success pressing companies to step up buybacks and to increase dividends, both meant to boost returns amid a soft economic recovery. Under pressure from billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, for example, Apple boosted its repurchase program in April to $140 billion from $90 billion last year. Icahn this week said he is again pressing to increase that amount.

Swiss police arrested seven FIFA officials who are now awaiting extradition to the United States.

From July, McDonald’s will report only quarterly comparable sales, which newly-appointed chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, said would be a better measure of sales at the world’s biggest restaurant chain. “Disclosing comparable sales as part of our quarterly reporting is consistent with nearly all retailers and will provide a greater understanding of McDonald’s sales results in the context of the company’s overall financial performance,” Easterbrook said at the Sanford Bernstein analysts’ conference on Wednesday. Easterbrook, who took over as CEO in March, also said the move would help McDonald’s focus on longer-term actions as part of a plan to turn the fast-food chain into a “modern, progressive burger company”. Same-store sales at McDonald’s restaurants globally have fallen for 11 straight months through April, prompting the company to announce a turnaround plan, which includes cutting costs, reorganizing business units and selling restaurants to franchisees. A large number of U.S. retailers have stopped reporting monthly same-store sales in recent years, including the world’s largest retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp  and Starbucks Corp. McDonald’s last monthly same-store sales report will be for June and will be issued along with its second-quarter results, expected some time in July. The company’s shares were up 0.4 percent at $98.90 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

830,MCD,UPDATE 4-Visa threatens to ditch FIFA as sponsor dismay mounts,"* Visa says disappointment with FIFA is “profound” * Consumers attack brands on Twitter * Nike says cooperating with authorities * Adidas, Coca-Cola Hyundai, McDonald’s, Anheuser-Busch concerned * World Cup seen as too lucrative to ditch   (Adds comment, background) By Anjali Athavaley and Emma Thomasson NEW YORK/BERLIN, May 28 (Reuters) - Visa Inc has told FIFA it could end its sponsorship if soccer’s governing body does not act fast to restore the reputation of the game after senior officials were arrested on  corruption charges. The statement from Visa was the strongest so far as sponsors lined up to express concern about the scandal engulfing the world’s most popular sport and their customers took to social media to threaten a boycott of brands associated with FIFA. Sponsors are trying to balance the growing sensitivity of consumers to corruption, human rights abuses and environmental issues against their relationship with the organisation that holds the keys to a billion soccer fans worldwide. “Our disappointment and concern with FIFA in light of today’s developments is profound. As a sponsor, we expect FIFA to take swift and immediate steps to address these issues within its organization,” Visa said. “This starts with rebuilding a culture with strong ethical practices,” it said. “Should FIFA fail to do so, we have informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship.” U.S. prosecutors issued an indictment on Wednesday accusing nine officials from soccer’s world governing body and five sports media and promotions executives of bribes involving more than $150 million over 24 years. Airline Emirates and Japanese electronics maker Sony Corp announced in November they would not renew deals with FIFA, although rivals Qatar Airways and Samsung  are reportedly in talks to replace them. Emirates and Sony were among FIFA’s six main partners who together paid a total of $177 million in 2014 for the right to advertise in World Cup stadiums and use the FIFA trademark. A source familiar with the Sony decision said suspected corruption was one factor behind Sony’s withdrawal although the main reason was the high cost of the sponsorship deal. Sponsors have long faced risks to their brands from sports scandals ranging from doping to match fixing to misbehaviour of top players on and off the pitch. Sponsors including Nike Inc dropped American cyclist Lance Armstrong in 2012 after he was banned for doping, but Germany’s Adidas decided last year to stick with Uruguay’s Luis Suarez after FIFA banned him for nine matches for biting an Italy defender. “Brands have to take a longer-term view. Any sport is littered with controversy on and off the field,” said Paul Smith, founder of sports marketing research group Repucom. “What fans care about most of all is the game itself rather than the business of the game... Being a sponsor of FIFA implies you are a sponsor of the game, not of the organisation.” FIFA’s longest standing partners are Adidas and Coca-Cola Co . Adidas has been the provider of the World Cup match ball since 1970 and has a partnership lasting until 2030, while the current deal for Coca-Cola, which has had a formal association since 1974 and has advertised in every World Cup stadium since 1950, lasts until 2022. That perhaps explains why they stopped short of threatening to cut ties like Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, which only became a FIFA partner in 2007 and recently extended the relationship until 2022. “This lengthy controversy has tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations,” Coca Cola said. Adidas, which is the world’s biggest manufacturer of soccer balls, boots and shirts, side stepped outright criticism, calling instead for FIFA “to continue to establish and follow transparent compliance standards”. Its shares fell 1.5 percent on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nike, which is not a FIFA partner but is challenging Adidas’ dominance in soccer by sponsoring many of the world’s top players and teams, said it was cooperating with authorities after it was indirectly identified in the U.S. indictment in relation to a 1996 deal with the Brazil team. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch declined to comment on whether there was any liability for companies that had won marketing rights and if they were being investigated. But she said “the investigation is continuing and covers all aspects.” She declined to comment when asked if one of the companies was Nike. Nike later said in a statement it was “concerned by the very serious allegations, adding: “Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery.” FIFA’s main sponsors were already getting uneasy even before the latest revelations. Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola all made statements last week pushing FIFA to take seriously the issue of rights for migrant workers in Qatar, responding to reports of abuses at the 2022 World Cup construction sites. That came after campaigners designed spoof ads for major FIFA sponsors subverting their brand images, including a Coca-Cola can dripping with oil and the iconic three stripes of Adidas tweaked to look like a line of gravestones. The pressure only mounted after Wednesday’s news, with social media full of appeals for brands to cut ties with FIFA. “Adidas, Visa, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Budweiser, Hyundai: stop supporting corrupt FIFA or I stop buying your brands,” wrote Stefan-Joerg Goebel on Twitter. The Institute of Directors (IoD), a leading UK authority on corporate governance, said risks were mounting for sponsors. “They have a responsibility to their shareholders to make certain that the company’s cash is not going towards sporting events mired in bribery and corruption allegations,” said Roger Barker, IoD director of corporate governance. South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor, the sole Asian FIFA partner for the 2018 World Cup due to be held in Russia, said it was “extremely concerned” about the legal proceedings, while Bud-owner Anheuser-Busch InBev and McDonald’s Corp said they were in contact with FIFA. Australian sportswear company SKINS, which announced in a tongue-in-cheek campaign in January that it was the first “official” FIFA non-sponsor, urged the brands to clean up FIFA. “The only people FIFA will listen to are the sponsors. The real money is with the broadcasters but their brands aren’t exposed in the same way as the sponsors,” said SKINS chairman Jaimie Fuller. But brand experts were sceptical of a mass exodus of FIFA sponsors. “Football is one of the few global properties that enables you to connect with people around the world,” said Interbrand Chief Executive Jez Frampton. Rob Prazmark, president of 21 Sports & Entertainment Marketing Group, a global sports and event sales agency agreed: “These sponsors put a lot of money into associating with the World Cup,” he said. “They’ll give them a little bit of time to get their house in order.”   (Additional reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir, Nate Raymond, Steve Slater, Ando Ritsuko and Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by David Stamp and Giles Elgood)",5282015,http://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-fifa-sponsors/update-4-visa-threatens-to-ditch-fifa-as-sponsor-dismay-mounts-idUSL1N0YJ06M20150528
831,MCD,Foster Farms backs away from using human antibiotics in poultry,"June 1 (Reuters) - Foster Farms, one of the top U.S. chicken producers, plans to largely eliminate antibiotics used to treat humans from its poultry production, it said on Monday. The move brings California-based Foster Farms in line with other top chicken producers, including market leader Tyson Foods Inc, that are backing away from using the drugs over concerns about antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Privately held Foster Farms is working to end the use of all antibiotics used in human medicine, except in instances where the health of a poultry flock is at risk, and has stopped using antibiotics considered to be critical to human health, according to a statement. Independent auditors will ensure compliance with the company’s plans, it said. It will continue to use animal-only antibiotics when needed for “conventional” flocks, or those not designated to be antibiotic-free, it said. There have not been any human health concerns raised over animal-only antibiotics. The debate over the agriculture industry’s longstanding practice of using human antibiotics in livestock production has heated up in recent years. Public health experts and federal regulators have grown increasingly concerned that their use could create a health hazard by spurring the creation of antibiotic-resistant superbugs in humans. Tyson has said it plans to eliminate the use of human antibiotics in its chicken flocks by September 2017. Its move will help the company meet a deadline outlined by McDonald’s Corp for its U.S. restaurants to gradually stop buying chicken raised with human antibiotics over the next two years. In 2013, Foster Farms was the 10th largest U.S. poultry producer. It produced 21 million pounds of ready to cook chicken a week, according to industry data.

The world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue is fighting to lure back customers lost to slower service, more nimble rivals and increasing consumer demand for fresh, less-processed food.  Shares of the world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue inched up 0.2 percent to $95.39 in midday trading.  Global sales at McDonald’s restaurants open at least 13 months fell 0.3 percent in May, marking a full year of monthly sales declines. Analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had expected a decline of 0.9 percent. European sales were up a better-then-expected 2.3 percent. The biggest boost came from the United Kingdom, which served up strong results from its “Great Taste of America” campaign, Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a client note.  Germany and France each were up slightly after promoting “everyday value” and premium food. Analysts had expected sales in Europe to rise just 0.6 percent. U.S. same-restaurant sales disappointed, dropping 2.2 percent in May. Traffic to its domestic restaurants fell again as rivals, ranging from sandwich chain Chick-fil-A to burrito seller Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N), continued to pick off customers. Analysts had expected a decline of 1.7 percent. McDonald’s USA is running a variety of tests aimed at luring back customers. Those tests include extended breakfast hours, custom burgers and new food such as breakfast bowls made with kale and spinach. Frustrated franchisees are clamoring for the company to trim and simplify its massive menu, which they blame for service slow-downs that turn off diners.  May sales were off 3.2 percent in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA) region, less than analysts’ estimate for a 3.8 percent drop.

Stronger-than-expected jobs data for May and a pickup in wages were the latest signs of improved momentum in the economy, prompting expectations of a rate hike sooner rather than later. While the Fed is broadly expected to raise interest rates this year, the timing of the move has kept the market on tenterhooks. Wall Street’s top banks said they expect the Fed to begin raising rates in September, followed by another increase before the end of the year, according to a Reuters poll. “I think we’ll see a lot more back and forth for a while,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. “There are concerns that the Fed will be more aggressive regarding the timing of the hike and a steeper hike following the first one.” More sales of German government bonds weighed on European stock markets, while the dollar retreated after a report - later denied - that President Barack Obama had expressed concern over its strength after a year-long rally. Higher bond yields make stocks less attractive. U.S. benchmark Treasury debt yields on Friday posted their best weekly performance in two years after strong jobs data, while German bunds hit 8-year highs.

842,MCD,UPDATE 1-McDonald's plans to sell Taiwan stores to franchise operator,"* Firm planning to sell all 413 Taiwan stores to franchisee * Previously said to increase franchisee ownership globally * McDonald’s wants single entity to oversee Taiwan stores   (Adds spokeswoman comment, context) By Adam Jourdan SHANGHAI, June 25 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp said it is aiming to sell all of its 413 Taiwan-based stores to a franchise operator, as the U.S. fast-food chain looks to cut costs globally and turn around its flagging China business. The move could help comfort investors who were skeptical and wanted specific details after McDonald’s new CEO Steve Easterbrook announced a revamp plan in May that included reorganizing business units and selling outlets to franchisees. “McDonald’s has decided to search for suitable candidates to become its developmental licensee in Taiwan,” the company said in a statement sent to Reuters on Thursday. It added the model would enable “faster local decision-making, quicker learning, and restaurant growth”. A China-based spokeswoman for the company said the burger chain was looking for a single entity to oversee all of the Taiwan stores. She declined to comment further on the move. The U.S. chain relies heavily on franchises in more mature markets such as the United States, but traditionally has focused on self-operated stores in China. It has said previously it is trying to increase the proportion of franchised stores there. McDonald’s, which has close to 20,000 part-time and full-time staff in Taiwan, is also looking to bounce back from a food-safety scare that hit business in China and the wider region last year. China’s fast-food market was worth 798 billion yuan  ($128.53 billion) last year, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Yum Brands Inc’s KFC chain had around 5.1 percent of the market, ahead of McDonald’s share of 2.6 percent. CEO Easterbrook has said McDonald’s will sell 3,500 restaurants to franchisees by 2018, taking global franchisee ownership to 90 percent from 81 percent now.

In videos posted online, some customers said they heard a curse when, by tapping one of the tiny plastic caveman characters against a hard surface, they activated its voice.

Coca-Cola Co and McDonald’s Corp both made it clear that they are deeply unhappy with the way FIFA is governed and want major change.  Their intervention comes only days ahead of a crucial FIFA executive committee meeting on Monday at which both possible reforms and a timetable to elect a new president to replace Sepp Blatter, who has run FIFA for 17 years, will be discussed. FIFA has been the subject of a series of allegations in the media - and in books - for many years. The scandal came to a head in May when U.S. prosecutors indicted nine soccer officials, most of whom had FIFA positions, and five marketing and broadcasting company executives with a range of bribery-related offences, including fraud, money-laundering and racketeering. Coca-Cola urged Zurich-based FIFA to support the creation of an independent body to reform the way it is run. “We have written to FIFA and asked them to support an independent third-party commission for reforms,” a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola said on Friday. And McDonald’s said it has told FIFA that there needs to be “meaningful changes to restore trust and credibility with fans and sponsors alike,” stressing that FIFA’s internal controls and compliance culture “are inconsistent with expectations McDonald’s has for its business partners throughout the world.”     The U.S. national labor union federation, AFL-CIO, wrote to the CEOs of Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and fellow FIFA sponsor, Visa Inc, this week to ask them to support the calls for an independent commission. McDonald’s, while not specifying particular support for an independent commission, said in a statement that “recent allegations and indictments have severely tarnished FIFA in a way that strikes at the very heart of our sponsorship.” The fast-food giant added: “The world expects concrete actions and so does McDonald’s.” Added a McDonald’s spokesman: “There is a wide range of deep reform that has to happen within FIFA. An independent commission is among the examples of how to address the urgent need for reform.” Visa did not immediately provide a comment. Responding to the comments from Coca-Cola and McDonald’s, a spokeswoman for FIFA said: “FIFA values the input of its commercial affiliates as the organization continues to cooperate with the ongoing investigations by U.S. and Swiss authorities.” A number of anti-corruption groups, including Transparency International, also issued calls this week for FIFA’s reform process to be handled by an independent body. “It is time for other sponsors to speak out, step up and back the ball for an independent reform commission,” said Transparency International spokesman Neil Martinson in commenting on the Coca-Cola statement.

To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at . Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT) Visa Inc, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, is expected to report a third-quarter profit, helped by higher U.S. consumer spending boosted by lower gasoline prices and a strong labor market. U.S. consumer spending recorded its largest increase in nearly six years in May on strong demand for automobiles and other big-ticket items. EU antitrust regulators are probing Visa International’s inter-regional card fees, after accusing MasterCard of levying excessive fees, earlier in July. E-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report second-quarter revenue marginally above estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, helped by growth in Amazon Web Services and sales in North America. The company broke out financial details of the cloud computing unit, a $5 billion business, for the first time last quarter. The company is expected to continue to report a loss, as it invests in products and services that ranged from Hollywood-style television productions to drone delivery and streaming video-calls. Second-quarter sales of McDonald’s Corp are expected to beat Wall Street estimates as the fast food chain’s turnaround efforts gain traction. Steve Easterbrook, who took the helm in March, has been working to reorganize some business units, sell restaurants to franchisees and cut costs to turn the fast-food giant into a “modern, progressive burger company”. Investors will look out for any updates to its turnaround plans and any forecast. Dow company 3M Co is expected to post second-quarter earnings of nearly $2 per share on $7.83 billion in revenue, amid a shaky global economy that is causing concern for multinational companies. The company, whose shares have fallen some 5 percent this year, last month struck its biggest-ever acquisition to boost its presence in worker protection gear. Mining and construction machinery maker Caterpillar Inc is scheduled to release second-quarter earnings. Hurt by downturns in the previously profitable mining sector, the company has made labor cuts in both U.S. and international factories. Last quarter, CEO Doug Oberhelman said the remaining 2015 quarters’ sales and profit will be lower than the first quarter. Analysts look for mostly flat results as a potentially better construction industries outlook will likely be overshadowed by soft revenue in the company’s resources industries. The U.S. Labor Department issues weekly unemployment data. The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits is expected to have slightly declined by 1000 to 280,000. (0830/1230)  In another report, the Conference Board is likely to show a 0.2 percent rise in its Leading Economic Index for June, after increasing 0.7 percent in May.  (1000/1400) AT&T; Inc, the No.2 U.S. carrier, will report second-quarter earnings as its proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirecTV is expected to be approved by regulators. Investors will keep an eye out for any impact of heated telecom industry competition on margins and subscriber metrics in addition to details on conditions imposed by the FCC on the DirecTV merger. Eli Lilly and Co, helped by cost cuts and new treatments for cancer and diabetes, is expected to report second-quarter earnings growth despite the stronger dollar and generic competition for its Cymbalta depression drug. The drugmaker, which has vowed to return to profit growth in 2015 following three years of patent expirations on its biggest products, is expected to outline research progress for many of its experimental medicines. Also, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co is expected to report lower second-quarter earnings and sales, hurt by the end of a longstanding agreement under which it had sold blockbuster schizophrenia drug Abilify in partnership with Japanese drugmaker Otsuka Holdings Co. Investors will be far more intent on how Bristol’s respected array of cancer immunotherapies are faring in clinical trials and whether its recently approved Opdivo is on track to meet sales expectations of $750 million this year, growing to $3.75 billion by 2017. Biotechnology company Celgene Corp pre-reported second-quarter results and provided updated 2015 and longer-range forecasts. However investors will be looking for fresh management comment on its recent spate of deals, including taking a $1 billion stake in Juno Therapeutics and a $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos Inc. Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc reports second-quarter results. The acquisitive company has been linked to reports that have it buying Zoetis and CEO Mike Pearson’s comments about M&A; plans are usually the headline from Valeant conference calls. China will be a hot topic for General Motors Co executives when they report second-quarter results. Analysts are looking for profits of about $1.08 a share, up from 58 cents a share a year ago. Car sales in China have slowed sharply posing a challenge to the Detroit automaker which has counted on sustaining 9-10 percent profit margins in China to offset weak performance in other markets outside the  U.S. Barclay’s this week cut its rating on GM to “equal weight” from “overweight” and predicted GM management would have to lower its mid-term targets for China. GM also has trimmed production in Europe. So far, Chief Executive Mary Barra has shown no sign that she intends to lower her profit targets, and she has booming U.S. demand for GM’s pickup trucks and large sport utility vehicles to buoy overall results. Comcast Corp, the largest U.S. cable TV provider, will report second-quarter earnings as the pay-TV market continues to grapple with stagnation. Wall Street will be keeping a close watch on Comcast’s video and broadband subscriber metrics.  Investors will also look out for details on whether the company’s upcoming video streaming service “Stream” targeting its younger customers can make up for losses in the pay-TV growth and hold its own in the increasingly competitive online streaming service market. No. 1 U.S. railroad Union Pacific Corp will report second-quarter results. Analysts will be watching to see how Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific managed its costs and its networks amid sharp drops in coal volumes during the quarter and whether it was able to continue raising prices. Starbucks Corp is expected to report strong third-quarter results as healthy sales trends and low costs for key ingredients such as milk offset the pressure from rising labor costs. Dow Chemical Co, which has been benefiting from low raw material costs for making plastics, is estimated to report a rise in second-quarter profit. The company has been ramping up its plastics operations, while shedding low margin businesses to increase its focus on performance plastics, electronics and agricultural science products. The company, which is growing investments mainly in the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Middle East, cut 3 percent of its global workforce in May as part of a broader plan to reduce costs by $1 billion over three years. Investors will look for details on additional cost-cutting measures. Second-quarter unit revenue is expected to decline for United Continental Holdings Inc and Southwest Airlines Co as the companies grow their capacity, and as United faces weak demand abroad from the strong U.S. dollar. Investors will listen for guidance the airlines give on whether they will lower their capacity growth plans in line with demand. U.S. regulators will be listening for the guidance too, as the Justice Department is investigating whether the carriers along with Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group Inc have worked together illegally to keep fares high by signaling supply cuts. Under Armour Inc, the No.2 U.S. footwear company, is expected to report second-quarter sales above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, helped by higher demand for Speed Form and Curry One shoes. Under Armour, which typically beats expectations, had a rough first quarter hurt by high expenses following a couple of acquisitions. The company had raised its full-year forecast, which was still shy of street expectations. Last week, Under Armour brought in Dallas Mavericks’ CEO Terdema Ussery as a president in a bid to grow its NBA-related offerings that are popular among young Americans. Investors will be keen on any changes to full-year forecast and any sign ups. Boston Scientific Corp is expected to report a fall in second-quarter profit, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, as the company continues to face litigation charges. These charges prompted the medical device maker to cut its full-year forecast last quarter. The company is in the middle of court battles for claims alleging injuries caused by its transvaginal mesh device. In May, a Delaware Jury ordered the company to pay $100 million to a woman who said she was injured by the device. Rogers Communications Inc, Canada’s largest wireless operator and a major cable and media company, posts second-quarter results. Investors are expecting a slip in profit from a year ago on higher revenue, and will be closely watching subscriber numbers for any signs that losses are slowing or even reversing. Copper miner and energy producer Freeport-McMoran Inc’s second-quarter results will be squeezed by declines in copper, gold and oil prices, with analysts expecting a drop in both profit and revenue compared with last year. The market may focus more on developments in the company’s oil and gas business, after Freeport-McMoran increased capital spending and filed for an IPO of a portion of the unit. There is also keen interest in talks that Freeport is holding with the Indonesian government to establish contract certainty before making big investments in its Grasberg copper and gold mining complex. Freeport’s hefty $20.3 billion debt load is also an issue. Also, Teck Resources Ltd’s second-quarter results will again be hurt by weaker metallurgical coal prices, outweighing small improvements in copper and zinc prices. The market will be looking for signs of a further dividend cut after Teck slashed its dividend by 67 percent in April. Land rig provider Patterson-UTI Energy Inc is expected to swing to a second-quarter loss as oil and gas producers cut back on drilling amid a steep fall in crude prices. Patterson-UTI had an average of 122 rigs active in the second quarter, down from 201 rigs a year earlier. Still, the company has fared better than its rivals, helped by demand for new, faster rigs that help oil drillers cut costs and operate more efficiently. Investors will want to know if demand for these high-spec rigs will remain robust. They will also look for details on the company’s cost control measures. Separately, Precision Drilling Corp, Canada’s largest oil and gas rig contractor, is expected to report a bigger loss for the second-quarter as customers cut back spending amid a steep drop in crude prices. The company has cut jobs and reduced operating expenses to prop up margins. Investors will want to know more about the company’s spending plans and demand for its rigs. Dunkin Brands Group Inc, the owner of the Dunkin Donuts and Baskin-Robbins chains is likely to report second-quarter sales slightly above analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The company had raised its full-year revenue and adjusted profit forecast in April after a strong first quarter and its deal to sell Dunkin K-cups at groceries and other retail outlets and online through J M Smucker and Keurig Green Mountain. Investors will look for updates on sales of its K-cups through Keurig and Smucker, progress on Dunkin’s loyalty program and its plan to launch online ordering next year. PulteGroup Inc, the third largest U.S. homebuilder, is expected to report a higher revenue and profit for the second-quarter, as it sold more homes at higher prices. Investors will be looking out for an update on full year financial forecast. Investment bank and asset manager Lazard Ltd is expected to report a second-quarter profit helped by a jump in advisory fees amid a strong M&A; market. Large deals drove M&A; volumes globally in the second quarter of 2015, up by 34.6 percent year-on-year to $1.33 trillion as of June 26. Analysts’ expect Lazard to benefit from recovery in European M&A; market and strong gains at its asset management business. Lazard has been focusing on asset management to reduce reliance on financial advisory fees. Online music streaming company Pandora Media Inc is expected to report second-quarter earnings slightly below analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The company, which streams music by predicting listener’s preferences, has been facing stiff competition from Spotify and Apple Inc’s Beats. Investor focus will be Pandora’s strategy to monetize mobile ad revenue that can reduce its losses due to high content acquisition costs. Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever Plc will report second-quarter results. The company has done four deals this year in high end skincare, taking small steps toward its goal of repositioning its portfolio away from food toward personal care. Swiss crop chemicals company Syngenta AG reports results for the first half. It will try to show it can offer shareholders earnings prospects that compare favorably against Monsanto’s takeover proposal. Investors have voiced frustration about Syngenta’s refusal to negotiate with the suitor and about what they regard as unwillingness to talk it through with the shareholders. Unfavorable weather and currency trends will make it hard for Syngenta to map out a long-term gain in margins. Canada’s retail sales are forecast to have edged up by 0.5 percent in May, a potentially encouraging sign for an economy that got off to a weak start to the second quarter. (0830/1230) Brazil’s statistics agency IBGE releases unemployment data for June. The country’s non-seasonally adjusted jobless rate is expected to have risen 6.90 percent after rising 6.70 percent in May. Mexico’s consumer price data from the first half of July will show whether a lasting weakness in the peso has helped lift inflation from above record lows as the central bank has been hinting it could. Inflation in the first half of July is likely to have increased 0.16 percent from 0.13 percent in the first half of June.

853,MCD,"McDonald's CEO says momentum is building, sees sales turnaround","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s (MCD.N) new chief executive expects global sales at established restaurants to grow in the current quarter, reversing more than a year of declines, and said his turnaround plan is showing early signs of taking hold. The world’s biggest fast-food chain, which popularized burgers and french fries, is battling nimble rivals who are doing a better job of meeting consumers’ growing appetite for fresher, less processed food.  Since taking the helm in March, McDonald’s CEO Steve Easterbrook repeatedly has vowed to turn McDonald’s into “a modern, progressive burger company.” Easterbrook, who debuted his turnaround plan in May, on Thursday said: “While our second quarter results were disappointing, we are seeing early signs of momentum.”     But McDonald’s still has a long way to go. Net income tumbled 13 percent to $1.20 billion, or $1.26 a share, in the second quarter. Total revenue fell 10 percent to $6.50 billion.

857,MCD,"FIFA to meet sponsors after reproaches from Coke, Visa, McDonald's","ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - FIFA will meet its leading commercial partners next month after three of them increased pressure for major reforms to soccer’s governing body following a series of corruption scandals. FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said that Coca-Cola, Visa and McDonald’s had written asking for information about what was being done to clean up governance of the sport. He admitted that scandal had made it difficult to attract new sponsors. “Clearly, there were a number of sponsors, mainly three, its Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Visa, who have expressed and sent a letter to FIFA, asking for information,” he told a new conference in the Russian city of St Petersburg. “Two or three days ago we received a letter from all of them offering to meet together, so there will there will be a meeting next month.” Criticism of FIFA’s governance came to a head in May when U.S. prosecutors indicted nine soccer officials, most of whom had FIFA positions, and five marketing and broadcasting company executives over a range of alleged offences. These included fraud, money-laundering and racketeering. Valcke added that FIFA has been keeping its partners informed of developments. “We sent (information) to all our commercial partners, not just those three,” he said. “We sent them an update, a summary, of all that has happened within FIFA since 2012 since the first reform process started, (of) what has been changed within FIFA’s administration and around FIFA.”  “Definitely, the current situation doesn’t help to finalize any new agreements, it’s a fact, and I’m sure that until the next election, until February 26, there (will be) no major (sponsorship) announcements.” FIFA President Sepp Blatter is stepping down and a replacement will be chosen in February. Valcke also signaled that he would be leaving his job then. Valcke said that despite the current difficulties there was still enough time before the 2018 World Cup, to be held in Russia, to sign up new partners. The current sponsors have been goal in demanding changes.  Earlier this month, Coca-Cola urged Zurich-based FIFA to support the creation of an independent body to reform the way it is run.

859,MCD,"Food scares strip McDonald's, KFC of treat status in China","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - On birthdays and for special treats, Lu Yuanli would take her son to their local KFC for his favorite meal, fried chicken wings, but the Chinese mother hasn’t been back since a safety scare battered KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) and rival McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) last year. Lu is one of a growing number of Chinese parents turning their backs on the U.S. firms, further undermining their efforts to revive growth in a market seen as key to offset slowing global sales but where their food has lost is novelty factor and competition from local alternatives is fierce. “McDonald’s and KFC used to be kind of special places to go; now there are lots of Western-style brands in the market and McDonald’s and KFC are just part of the crowd,” said Yu, who now takes her 7-year-old son to local chain Beijing Origus for a seafood-to-pizza buffet. China is the biggest market for Yum, and home to the third largest number of restaurants for McDonald’s. Sales for both, which had steadily risen over the past decade, took a hit after Chinese regulators launched a probe into a local meat supplier last July for allegedly adding expired meat to its products. The safety scare was the second to hit the U.S. firms in China in as many years, and analysts said it became the tipping point for many families to stop eating at their restaurants. This lack of patronage becomes particularly painful as slower economic growth becomes the norm in China, and as consultants Euromonitor forecast growth in the already crowded fast food market to slow to around 4 percent by 2019, less than a third of the pace a decade earlier.  “The people who moved away were families and kids, these guys aren’t coming back,” said Ben Cavender, principal at China Market Research (CMR) Group. He said single professionals were flocking back to KFC and McDonald’s at a faster pace than families, but cautioned that these consumers won’t be enough to boost sales growth to pre-food scare levels. CMR survey data suggests Chinese consumers trust in, and desire for, KFC and McDonald’s has been falling since hitting a peak in 2010, with the decline accelerating since the 2012 food safety scare. Euromonitor data shows a similar trend: Yum’s share of the market for fast food chains slipped to around 30 percent last year from nearly 40 percent in 2010 while McDonald’s remained flat, as competition intensified from the likes of Ting Hsin International’s Dicos, Ajisen China Holdings Ltd (0538.HK), Huai Lai Shi Catering and Kungfu Catering.  Both U.S. firms have admitted China has become a tougher market since the food scare. In July, Yum executives said the recovery of China sales was taking longer than expected, citing the slowing economy and fierce competition. Yum declined to comment further for this story, while McDonald’s China spokeswoman Jessica Lee said the firm was increasing its market share, without giving specifics. In a bid to revive their sales momentum in China, Yum and McDonald’s are focusing on faster-growing segments of the fast food market such as pizza as well as customers in China’s rapidly developing smaller cities. Yum is also expanding its premium coffee business and earlier this year set up a high-end restaurant, Atto Primo, in Shanghai to gauge customers’ tastes. Trying to reassure consumers after the food scare, KFC opened more than 1,000 of its kitchens to Chinese diners while McDonald’s has published a list of its suppliers online. Not all diners, however, are convinced.  Shanghai executive Wang Zhiyong used to bring his son every week to eat burgers and play with other kids at his local McDonald’s, but concerns about the safety and healthiness of the food have kept him away for the past few years. “Food safety is now a much bigger issue, so I take a lot more care about what we eat,” he added.

Previously, McDonald’s had been critical of FIFA and urged change without specifically calling for an independent reform process.     “An independent commission would bring an appropriate level of credibility, transparency, and neutrality to the role, and ultimately provide sponsors and fans across the globe with the confidence that the reform effort is both meaningful and a step in the right direction,” wrote Sa Shekhem.

866,MCD,McDonald's No. 1 choice for 'Breakfastarians': poll,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp, which is expected to offer all-day breakfasts starting this fall to turn around slumping U.S. sales, is the top choice for “Breakfastarians,” who crave breakfast food at any hour, according to a new survey obtained by Reuters on Monday. Forty-one percent of consumers who eat breakfast twice a day consider McDonald’s for their next meal, according to the survey from YouGov BrandIndex, a brand perception research service. Sandwich chain Subway was diners’ second choice for anytime breakfast with 34 percent, followed by DineEquity Inc’s IHOP at 32 percent, Burger King with 27 percent and Starbucks Corp at 26 percent.  Denny’s Corp and Dunkin’ Donuts were tied with 25 percent each and Wendy’s Co got 23 percent, while KFC and Chick-fil-A rounded out the top 10 with 22 percent apiece. McDonald’s long has dominated the breakfast category, which already accounts for roughly 25 percent of McDonald’s sales and about 40 percent of profit in the United States.     Breakfast is the only U.S. restaurant meal time seeing an uptick in customer visits. Breakfast traffic was up 4 percent for the year ended May 2015, largely because of gains at fast-food chains, while lunch and dinner visits were flat, according to research firm NPD Group.   The category is increasingly competitive as growth-hungry chains dive in or double down with new breakfast menu items. McDonald’s added espresso drinks to its morning lineup of McMuffins and inexpensive drip coffee. Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts struck back with new and upgraded breakfast sandwiches and pastries. And, Taco Bell last year jumped in with waffle tacos and other twists on the morning meal. While McDonald’s holds the lead in the survey, its results suggest that the industry’s breakfast brawls are far from over. Chick-fil-A, IHOP and Taco Bell made the greatest purchase consideration gains in the last six months.

867,MCD,McDonald's No. 1 choice for 'Breakfastarians' -poll,"Aug 17 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp, which is expected to offer all-day breakfasts starting this fall to turn around slumping U.S. sales, is the top choice for “Breakfastarians,” who crave breakfast food at any hour, according to a new survey obtained by Reuters on Monday. Forty-one percent of consumers who eat breakfast twice a day consider McDonald’s for their next meal, according to the survey from YouGov BrandIndex, a brand perception research service. Sandwich chain Subway was diners’ second choice for anytime breakfast with 34 percent, followed by DineEquity Inc’s IHOP  at 32 percent, Burger King with 27 percent and Starbucks Corp at 26 percent. Denny’s Corp and Dunkin’ Donuts were tied with 25 percent each and Wendy’s Co got 23 percent, while KFC and Chick-fil-A rounded out the top 10 with 22 percent apiece. McDonald’s long has dominated the breakfast category, which already accounts for roughly 25 percent of McDonald’s sales and about 40 percent of profit in the United States. Breakfast is the only U.S. restaurant meal time seeing an uptick in customer visits. Breakfast traffic was up 4 percent for the year ended May 2015, largely because of gains at fast-food chains, while lunch and dinner visits were flat, according to research firm NPD Group. The category is increasingly competitive as growth-hungry chains dive in or double down with new breakfast menu items. McDonald’s added espresso drinks to its morning lineup of McMuffins and inexpensive drip coffee. Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts struck back with new and upgraded breakfast sandwiches and pastries. And, Taco Bell last year jumped in with waffle tacos and other twists on the morning meal. While McDonald’s holds the lead in the survey, its results suggest that the industry’s breakfast brawls are far from over. Chick-fil-A, IHOP and Taco Bell made the greatest purchase consideration gains in the last six months.

868,MCD,"REFILE-McDonald's grilled over labor, tax practices at Brazil hearing","(Corrects dateline from Aug 17. No changes to text) By Anthony Boadle BRASILIA, Aug 20 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp, the world’s biggest fast-food chain, was accused of mistreating its employees and dodging taxes on Thursday during a Senate hearing in Brazil, where politicians, union leaders and workers from five continents voiced allegations. McDonald’s has come under increasing scrutiny worldwide for allegations of labor abuses, health and safety violations, plus tax evasion in Europe, and Brazilian Senator Pablo Paim called a hearing to allow both sides to make their cases. McDonald’s deferred comment to its regional operator. Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc, the world’s largest McDonald’s franchisee and its main operator in Latin America, where it employs 95,000 people and had sales of $3.7 billion last year, was invited to attend the hearing but chose not to, a company spokesman said. “We are absolutely convinced that the company has complied with labor laws ever since it opened its first restaurant in Brazil 36 years ago,” Arcos Dorados said in a statement. It said the company was proud to be the top first-job employer for young Brazilians. Union representatives told the hearing that McDonald’s franchisees in Brazil have denied workers’ pay for extra time worked, not allowed them to join unions and employed teenagers in their kitchens without protective gear, causing some to suffer burns from frying grease and grills. “Instead of feeding society with good jobs and paying its fair share of taxes, McDonald’s feeds on communities, forcing people into dead-end jobs and avoiding taxes,” Scott Courtney of the U.S.-based Service Employees International Union said. The 1.9 million-member SEIU, which has backed the “Fight for $15” (hourly wage) campaign in the American fast food industry since a New York walkout in 2012, said the hearing was a chance to draw wider attention to McDonald’s labor policies. “McDonald’s is a global player, and people all over the world should know it is an unfair player that should face global pressure to pay its taxes and decent wages,” said Jutta Steinruck, a member of the European Parliament. She said McDonald’s is being investigated in Europe for allegedly evading payment of 1 billion euros in taxes. One of Brazil’s largest labor federations, the UGT, filed a complaint last Friday, asking prosecutors to investigate allegations of tax evasion, unfair competition and violation of franchise laws by Arcos Dorados. The company said it had not been informed of the complaint and said it was confident that it was “rigorously” following Brazilian laws. Previous legal complaints in Brazil have not affected the company and regulatory labor authorities have not taken action either. Witnesses at the hearing called on Brazil’s Congress to open an investigation into the labor practices of the fast food industry in Brazil, but that will require the signature of 80 lawmakers and concrete evidence of abuses, said Congressman Antonio Carlos Mendes Thame, who attended the hearing. The call for an inquiry was backed by 19-year-old Lucas da Cruz Marques, who worked for 18 months at a McDonald’s at a Sao Paulo metro station until he was fired last month after joining a union to press for better working conditions. “I thought it was a good career opportunity to go and work for a multinational company,” he said. Instead, he said he found a company that changed workers’ shifts around to cut their pay.

869,MCD,McDonald's signs second franchising deal in Russia,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp. (MCD.N) said on Friday it had signed its second deal with a Russian franchisee which will help it to expand in remote Siberian regions. Under the deal, Russian company GiD Llc will open up to 20 fast-food restaurants in the Novosibirsk, Tomsk, Kemerovo, and Altai regions in coming years. McDonald’s, which has operated in Russia for 25 years, already has more than 500 restaurants in 120 Russian cities servicing more than 1 million customers per day. Unlike in the United States, it has focused on developing its own restaurants in Russia and its first and until now only Russian franchising deal was signed in 2012.     “We are confident that the use of the franchising scheme will be a next step in the successful development of our business and will contribute to a further strengthening of the McDonald’s brand in Russia,” McDonald’s Russian Chief Executive Khamzat Khasbulatov said in a statement. Khasbulatov told Reuters in January McDonald’s would open fewer new restaurants in Russia this year than last because a fall in the rouble has increased expansion costs and was hurting consumers. Last year, the U.S. fast-food chain was hit by a string of snap inspections by a Russian state regulator, which were widely seen as retaliation for the West’s sanctions against Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

The videotape, which was unveiled by Mercy For Animals at a news conference in Los Angeles, depicts gruesome animal cruelty toward the birds at what the group said was T&S; Farm in Dukedom, Tennessee, which was under contract to Tyson Foods (TSN.N).

876,MCD,"Big labor sees organizing boon for autos, warehouses, more from U.S. ruling","(Reuters) - U.S. union leaders said on Friday that a landmark U.S. labor board ruling on companies’ obligations toward contract and franchise workers would help them organize manufacturers and e-commerce companies as well as fast food chains. On Thursday the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled the owner of a California recycling plant was a “joint employer” with the contractor that hired workers at the plant, essentially forcing both to bargain with the union together or risk violating U.S. labor law. Business groups, arguing that the ruling could lead to higher costs and hurt the economy, are pushing the Republican-led Congress to overturn it, in part it because the company named in the decision - Browning-Ferris - cannot challenge it in a federal court without overcoming a number of procedural hurdles. Unions see the decision as a breakthrough not just in efforts to help employees organizes at franchisees of McDonald’s Corp and other chains but also as a tool to counter the proliferation of subcontracting in other industries in which workers are one or two steps removed from the companies indirectly controlling them. Manufacturers including auto workers, food processors, steelmakers and aerospace companies are potential targets for union campaigns, said Elizabeth Bunn, director of the AFL-CIO’s organizing department, noting that plant workers are often not directly employed by the parent firm. “You literally can walk into almost any non-union manufacturing plant in the United States and you’ll see workers working on a line and not be able to distinguish who is temp from an agency and who is a direct employee of the company,” she said. Big labor has focused much of its resources over the past few years on pushing for higher wages in the fast-food industry, and the Browning-Ferris ruling could have implications for an ongoing NLRB case seeking to hold McDonald accountable as a “joint employer” for alleged violations at franchisees. ‘GAME-CHANGER’ But union organizers see Thursday’s ruling as paving the way for gains across a range of industries given the widespread use of subcontracting by the manufacturing and service sectors to lower costs. “It’s certainly a game changer,” said Teague Paterson, a partner at Beeson Tayer & Bodine, a law firm representing the union in the NLRB case. “Unions and workers have been frustrated by these triangulated relations that the board condoned in the past. It certainly opens the door to more organizing.” Rand Wilson, a veteran organizer and a communications and policy director at a Massachusetts chapter of the Services Employees International Union, said he saw potential in warehousing, cleaning services and health care. Another segment widely cited by organizers and labor experts is the warehouses of companies like Amazon.com Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Google Inc, which are often filled with workers from staffing agencies or contract firms. The Teamsters union recently won an election to represent warehouse and shipping workers at Google Express, the technology giant’s shopping delivery service. The workers are employed through staffing firm Adecco. Rome Aloise, president of the Teamsters in Northern California, said the Browning-Ferris ruling means Google will now have to be part of the discussions about working conditions with the union and the contractor. “This is a classic case. We won and are going into negotiations and now Google will have to come to the table.” It was a local branch of the Teamsters that originally brought the complaint about a union election at the Browning-Ferris recycling plant to the labor relations board, and the union has been active in organizing truck drivers and warehouse workers at delivery companies and tech firms. Amazon, Google and Adecco were not immediately available for comment. Wal-Mart spokesman Brian Nick said the company was still reviewing the decision but has concerns. Challenging the ruling in court will not be easy, opponents say, because a court could only take up the case if closely-held Browning-Ferris refuses to negotiate with the workers’ union. “This will not be resolved quickly,” said Browning-Ferris’s attorney Stuart Newman. He declined to specifically comment on the company’s next legal steps. Trade groups have little to no legal recourse, since they were not the subject of the NLRB’s ruling. “The litigation strategy is somewhere between challenging and nonexistent, and of course the NLRB knows that,” said Michael Layman, a vice-president at the International Franchise Association on Friday. Instead, the IFA and other groups said they would focus their efforts on Congress, which could write its own definition of employer responsibility for contract workers into law or pass a resolution blocking use of the new NLRB standard. The Republican chairmen of congressional committees with oversight of labor issues, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rep. John Kline of Minnesota, both pledged to introduce legislation that would roll back the decision. But any bill targeting Browning-Ferris would join other Republican measures aimed at reversing NLRB decisions that have yet to become law, and would likely face a veto as long as a Democrat is in the Oval Office, said Walter Olson, a senior fellow who tracks labor law at the libertarian Cato Institute. “The politics are such that, even though Republicans have strong majorities in both houses of Congress, the NLRB is considered enough of a party-line issue that a bill would get a presidential veto,” Olson said.

Sparkman said T&S; Farm had not received an award since 2008 and that it was recognized for a regional honor. McDonald’s has said it would phase out its use of chickens raised with certain kinds of antibiotics at its 14,000 U.S. restaurants as part of a major restructuring plan to reverse a long sales slump.

880,MCD,McDonald's U.S. to add all-day breakfast on October 6,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s U.S. franchisees have voted to begin offering all-day breakfast on Oct. 6, a widely expected move that the company and investors hope will help reverse slumping sales and traffic at the world’s biggest fast-food chain. Many U.S. consumers like to eat breakfast foods at all hours of the day. McDonald’s is the top choice for those so-called “Breakfastarians,” according to a recent survey from YouGov BrandIndex, a brand perception research service. McDonald’s all-day breakfast menu will include hotcakes, yogurt parfaits, oatmeal, hash browns, sausage burritos and either McMuffin sandwiches or biscuit sandwiches, according to the company, which did not say how much the new program is expected to boost results.   Richard Adams, a former McDonald’s franchisee turned consultant, said McDonald’s has told franchisees that all-day breakfast will lure 200 customers a week per restaurant. McDonald’s is expected to back its breakfast expansion with a significant advertising campaign, and Adams predicted that the company will get an initial sales boost from expanded breakfast service. All-day sales of McDonald’s iconic McMuffin sandwiches at the chain’s more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants could increase sales by as much as 2.5 percent a year, according to an internal company presentation obtained by Bloomberg News.  “Will this be a long term fix for McDonald’s USA? We won’t know until well into 2016,” Adams said. Some franchisees worry that extended breakfast service could complicate operations and slow service at a time when company executives have vowed to simplify and streamline the chain’s menu.  To that end, McDonald’s said that regional operators can decide whether to cut certain menu items based on local customer preferences.

886,MCD,McDonald's investor wants it to cut antibiotics in all meats,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A McDonald’s Corp shareholder group is renewing its call for the fast-food chain to stop buying any meat from animals raised with antibiotics vital to fighting human infections. The move from the Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, comes amid growing concern from public health experts that the overuse of such drugs is contributing to rising numbers of life-threatening human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria dubbed “superbugs.” The sisters withdrew a similar shareholder resolution shortly after McDonald’s USA announced in March that within two years it would phase out chicken produced with antibiotics important to human health.  While McDonald’s is taking a step forward, it is still far from the congregation’s goal, Sister Susan Mika said. She  represented the nuns at the McDonald’s annual meeting on May 21, where she announced that the resolution had been dropped, although it still cited concern over McDonald’s pork and beef supplies. “This double standard makes no sense to us; what’s good for the goose, ought to be good for the gander, or in this case, the whole farmyard,” Mika said on Thursday.  So, the sisters are back and pressing the world’s biggest restaurant chain to expand its antibiotic policy to include beef and pork, and to take it global. McDonald’s did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An estimated 70 percent of antibiotics important to human health are sold for use in meat and dairy production. Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal. However, as the number of human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria increases, consumer advocates and public health experts have become more critical of the practice of routinely feeding antibiotics to chickens, cattle and pigs. “We can reach a lot of people’s lives every day if changes are made” at McDonald’s and other fast-food chains, said Mika, who added that other shareholder groups of nuns and priests have vowed to back the new resolution. The sisters are a member of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR).

From Oct. 1 to Nov. 18 McDonald’s will offer “McB” burgers, made with organic beef sourced from organic farms in Germany and Austria.  The move from the world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue comes as it is revamping food-sourcing practices as part of new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook’s effort to transform McDonald’s into a “modern, progressive burger company.” Germans, known for their love of sausages, are eating less meat and more vegetarian food as concerns grow about health, animal welfare and the environmental cost of livestock farming. In Germany, beef certified as “organic” must come from cattle that eat organically grown feed and graze on pasture where synthetic chemical fertilizers and pesticides are not used.    “We have made a great effort to secure sufficient quantities of meat which satisfies the organic requirements and our own quality claims,” said Holger Beeck, chief executive of  McDonald’s Germany. McDonald’s has tweaked menus and worked to improve service in Germany, one of its top European markets. The company’s quarterly sales at established restaurants in Germany recently grew for the first time since the middle of 2012.  A McDonald’s U.S. spokeswoman declined to say whether the company would roll out the burger to other markets.

The widely expected move by Browning-Ferris Industries raises the prospect of a court challenge to the National Labor Relations Board’s decision in August. Browning-Ferris sent a letter this week to Teamsters Local 350 saying it had no employment relationship with workers at its California recycling plant despite the NLRB ruling that the company was a “joint employer” because it had indirect control over working conditions. A lawyer for the union, Susan Garea, on Friday said she would file a complaint later in the day with the NLRB. The five-member board will likely rule in the case by next year. That decision could then be appealed in federal courts. Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have already said they plan to be involved in any court challenge to the decision. Republicans in Congress have introduced legislation that would roll back the ruling but are not expected to muster the votes to override an expected veto by Democratic President Barack Obama. Since the board has already found that Browning-Ferris is a joint employer, the case will likely move up to the courts quickly, said the company’s lawyer, Stuart Newman. “It’s a very, very bad decision unsupported by precedent, so the sooner an appeals court throws it out, the better,” Newman said. In its 3-2 ruling, the NLRB found that a standard that said companies only qualify as joint employers of workers hired by another business if they had “direct and immediate” control over employment matters was outdated and did not reflect the realities of the 21st-century workforce. The board said companies can be held liable for labor violations committed by franchisees and contractors even when they have only indirect control.

897,MCD,McDonald's can have joint employer liability based on worker perceptions - judge,"(Reuters) - A federal judge allowed McDonald’s workers in Northern California to bring a putative class action on Friday claiming the fast food giant is liable for state wage law violations because the workers believed the company - and not the local franchisee - was its employer. The workers thought McDonald’s was their employer “because they wear McDonald’s uniforms, serve McDonald’s food in McDonald’s packaging, receive paystubs and orientation materials marked with McDonald’s name and logo, and, with the exception of [one plaintiff], applied for a job through McDonald’s website,” U.S. District Judge James Donato in San Francisco said in his ruling.

898,MCD,"FIFA sponsors Coca-Cola, McDonald's call on Blatter to resign","NEW YORK/ZURICH (Reuters) - Major soccer sponsors on Friday issued coordinated calls for the immediate resignation of FIFA president Sepp Blatter in the most significant move by companies supporting the sport since a bribery and corruption scandal erupted at world football’s governing body last May. Coca-Cola Co, McDonald’s, Visa, and Budweiser owner Anheuser-Busch InBev, companies that have long linked their brand names to soccer, on Friday demanded Blatter step down immediately in a strong push for change at the organization. Blatter earlier announced he would resign in February next year. The sponsor statements, all using similar language, came just a week after Swiss authorities said they were opening a criminal investigation into Blatter, the 79-year-old Swiss national who has lead FIFA for the past 17 years. AB InBev said it has been “actively engaged” in the FIFA reform process as part of a group of sponsors. “Every day that passes, the image and reputation of FIFA continues to tarnish,” Coca Cola said. “FIFA needs comprehensive and urgent reform, and that can only be accomplished through a truly independent approach.” Visa and McDonald’s joined the call for Blatter to step aside. “The events of recent weeks have continued to diminish the reputation of FIFA and public confidence in its leadership,” McDonald’s said in an emailed statement. Blatter responded by saying he would not resign, setting the stage for a battle over who should take the helm in the next few months before February when elections are set for a new FIFA president. In a statement from his U.S. lawyer Richard Cullen, Blatter said he believed leaving office would not be in FIFA’s best interest or advance the needed reforms of the organization. Scandals surrounding global soccer exploded in May, when 14 soccer officials and sports marketing executives were indicted on U.S. charges of racketeering, money laundering and wire fraud in relation to bribery schemes that dated back decades. Last Friday, the Swiss Office of the Attorney General said it opened a criminal investigation into Blatter on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation of funds. It was the first time that authorities investigating corruption in the world’s most popular sport had pointed the finger directly at Blatter. He has denied wrongdoing and his U.S. attorney said he was cooperating with the Swiss probe. FIFA’s awarding of the 2018 and 2022 competitions to Russia and Qatar is one of the strands under scrutiny from U.S. and Swiss authorities investigating corruption in the organization, a worry for tournament sponsors including McDonald’s, Coca-Cola and Visa. “One of the things consumers are looking for in brands today is for them to be responsible,” said Trevor Wade from the brand consultancy firm Landor. She said the moves by the sponsors was a way to take a public stand about something they think matters to customers. It is an unprecedented decision by companies that have largely stood back as developments in the case unfolded in recent months, said Jaimie Fuller a co-founder of campaign group #NewFifaNow. “The drastic nature of this call stresses the extreme problems faced by FIFA,” Fuller said, “and should show everybody how the sports governing body is teetering on the abyss.”    (Additional reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar and Nandita Bose)",10022015,http://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-fifa-coca-cola/fifa-sponsors-coca-cola-mcdonalds-call-on-blatter-to-resign-idUSL1N1222B120151002

908,MCD,"At luxury price, McDonald's needs double-decker good news","NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - When McDonald’s Corp  reports its third quarter earnings on Thursday, it will have to make good on its promise of global same-store sales growth and aim for a smaller decline in revenue if it is to hold investors who have already bid up shares to record levels this year. Early last quarter, new chief executive Steve Easterbrook said the company would post a positive number for global same-store sales in the third quarter, reversing more than a year of declines. Since then, the company’s shares have climbed 5.9 percent while the broad S&P; 500 index fell 3.9 percent. Optimistic buyers have priced the shares for growth that has yet to materialize, and against broad concerns that increased burger competition and healthy dining preferences will continue to suppress the chain’s sales. Analysts are predicting a fairly steep 8.2 percent decline in total third quarter sales. The Thursday report is likely to produce greater than normal trading volatility in the shares, based on recent options activity. Despite the projected revenue decline, the consensus forecast for the third quarter is for a 17 percent jump in earnings per share, to $1.27. Like other companies in the S&P; 500, McDonald’s has managed to improve its earnings per share by buying back its own shares and cutting costs. Some of the stock’s momentum may already have slipped away, as investors discounted earnings and took greater note of McDonald’s underlying sales weakness. The number of U.S. funds holding McDonald’s has fallen about 15 percent this year according to Lipper data. Analysts have put a median target price of $104 on the stock, pointing to a top in the share price that closed at a record of $104.82 on Friday. One investor who got off the boat is Christopher Rowane, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. He said his fund held a “significant positioning” in McDonald’s and largely reduced it midway through this year. “Millenials can drive some of that traffic the most, and they are looking for fresh, natural, organic” food, he said. “That’s fairly distant from the McDonald’s menu.” Weak sales against an 11 percent rise in McDonald’s shares this year have made the company unusually expensive. At just over 20, its forward price earnings ratio is at its highest since early 2001, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. The company has made several changes - from adding an all day breakfast menu to pledging to phase out chickens fed on certain antibiotics. Some, including Credit Suisse, are expecting those efforts to help. This week the bank added McDonald’s to its Global Focus List, and reiterated an outperform rating with a $112 price target. The bank said late last month U.S. same restaurant sales were starting to recover partly due to menu changes. McDonald’s shares also may have benefited from speculation that the company is near a decision to spin off its real estate holdings into an investment trust, or REIT. “It would unlock some value but I think they would rather grow the business by improving traffic,” said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager with Hodges Funds in Dallas who holds the stock in separate managed accounts for its sizeable 3.3 percent dividend, but sold it out of its funds last year due to declining earnings. Adding to concerns, a technical look at the stock’s chart is throwing a big red flag. The long-term trend shows the stock has topped near its current level of $102.40 three times in the past four years, indicating a strong technical resistance.

909,MCD,McDonald's stock hits record high as turnaround takes hold,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) shares hit an all-time high on Thursday after Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said a rebound in quarterly restaurant sales showed that his turnaround plan is starting to work. Global sales at established restaurants were up a much better-than-expected 4 percent in the third quarter, ending six straight quarters of flat or falling results. And, Easterbrook said, the trend would continue in the current quarter. Shares of the world’s biggest restaurant chain by sales jumped more than 8 percent to a record $110.88 in early trading  as a renewed focus on value and service helped business around the world. “The progress we have made in a short amount of time gives me confidence we’re making the right moves to turn around our business and reposition McDonald’s as a modern, progressive burger company,” Easterbrook said on a conference call with analysts and investors. The United States, McDonald’s No. 1 market for profit, reported a surprise 0.9 percent increase in sales at restaurants open at least 13 months. McDonald’s said a new Premium Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Deluxe sandwich and its decision to swap butter for margarine on its Egg McMuffins helped the division break a two-year streak of quarterly sales declines.  China’s same-restaurant sales, which had plummeted after a food safety scandal in July 2014, were up a whopping 26.8 percent for the quarter, helped by a focus on value and breakfast.  Australia, the United Kingdom and Canada also contributed to the quarterly rise in sales at restaurants open at least 13 months, after McDonald’s tweaked menus, improved service and refined its offering of inexpensive food. Easterbrook, now eight months into his tenure as CEO, has announced plans to speed up service, simplify menus and boost food quality. In the United States, he rolled out all-day breakfast, began switching to chicken from birds raised without important antibiotics and raised wages for workers in restaurants run by the corporation. On Thursday, Easterbrook said winning back customers remains a top priority in the United States, where competition is fierce and speed is key.  All-day breakfast, launched Oct. 6, is part of that effort.  While that move appears to have boosted traffic, some domestic franchisees complain that all-day breakfast and the company’s plans to customize sandwiches is complicating operations and slowing service. Easterbrook said restaurant operators have embraced all-day breakfast, and that an early read suggests it is “an incremental profitable business” wooing new and existing customers. On the other hand, McDonald’s said its decision to raise wages and improve benefits for 90,000 workers in U.S. company-operated restaurants took a bite out of operating income.   Third-quarter net income was up 23 percent to $1.31 billion, or $1.40 per share. Revenue fell 5 percent to $6.62 billion.  Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said the strong U.S. dollar would ding fourth-quarter earnings per share by 8 to 10 cents. McDonald’s gets about one-third of revenue and more than half of its operating income from outside the United States. At midday, McDonald’s shares were up 7.5 percent to $110.20.

910,MCD,S&P; 500 ends at highest in two months; Alphabet up after hours,"(Reuters) - The S&P; 500 closed at its highest in two months on Thursday as stronger-than-expected earnings from several top companies, including McDonald’s, relieved investors’ concerns about the profit outlook. Buying accelerated after the close, with broad gains in tech and other companies that reported results, including Alphabet (GOOGL.O), up 9.6 percent at $746.78, and Microsoft (MSFT.O), up 7.2 percent at $51.50. Amazon (AMZN.O) rose 10.6 percent to $623.75 after it posted results. Nasdaq 100 futures NQc1 jumped after the close as well, and were up about 17 percent from the 2015 intraday low hit on Aug. 24. During the regular session, McDonald’s (MCD.N) shares jumped 8.1 percent to $110.87, giving the Dow its biggest boost, after its quarterly results beat estimates as demand recovered in China. EBay (EBAY.O) rose 13.9 percent to $27.58 after it reported better-than-expected results late on Wednesday.  Dow Chemical DOW.N rose 5.1 percent to $49.92 after its results, while the S&P; materials index .SPLRCM jumped 2.8 percent and led the S&P; sector gains along with the industrials .SPLRCI, also up 2.8 percent. In another sign of diminished concerns, the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX - the market’s favored barometer of volatility - closed at a 2-month low. “Corporate earnings certainly helped because the season started off sort of sluggish and you had some nice surprises today,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp. in Chicago. Investors have been concerned about weak third-quarter earnings after some disappointing early results. S&P; 500 earnings still are estimated to have fallen 3.3 percent in the quarter compared with a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 320.55 points, or 1.87 percent, to 17,489.16, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 33.57 points, or 1.66 percent, to 2,052.51 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 79.93 points, or 1.65 percent, to 4,920.05. Adding to the day’s optimism, ECB President Mario Draghi said the bank could extend its stimulus program beyond 2016 to boost euro zone growth and boost inflation closer to 2 percent. Data on Thursday showed new claims for U.S. unemployment benefits rose by 3,000 to 259,000 last week, below the 265,000 expected, while existing home sales increased more than expected to an annual rate of 5.55 million units in September. The Federal Reserve, which kept U.S. interest rates unchanged near zero in September, has said it will wait for signs of global economic resilience before pulling the trigger on its first rate hike in nearly a decade. Nine of the 10 major S&P; sectors were higher. Only healthcare .SPXHC appeared immune to the upbeat mood, declining about 0.5 percent. Community Health Systems (CYH.N) sank 35.1 percent to $26.30 after it gave a disappointing revenue outlook. It dragged down shares of other hospital operators.

Shares of Dow component McDonald’s soared 7.5 percent to $110.18 after its quarterly earnings and revenue beat estimates as demand recovered in China. The stock gave the biggest boost to the S&P; 500 and the Dow. Dow Chemicals rose 5.6 percent to $50.11 while Southwest Airlines rose 5.9 percent to $43.47 after the companies reported strong results. At 9:52 a.m. ET (1352 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 153.93 points, or 0.9 percent, at 17,322.54, the S&P; 500 was up 19.63 points, or 0.97 percent, at 2,038.57 and the Nasdaq composite index was up 55.21 points, or 1.14 percent, at 4,895.33. Nine of the 10 major S&P; sectors were up, with the materials sector’s 1.8 percent rise leading the advancers. Dow Chemicals provided the biggest boost to the materials sector. Technology majors Microsoft, Alphabet, AT&T; and Amazon are due to report after the close. “I think expectations are pretty low for everybody and that’s probably why you’re seeing some beats here,” said Tom Cassidy, chief investment officer at Girard Partners. Cassidy said the biggest factor for investors scrutinizing the reports would be revenue, which has been hurt by a slowing global economy and a stronger dollar. The dollar index inched up after the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged. The index has risen roughly 5 percent this year. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the bank could extend its stimulus program beyond 2016 as part of its efforts to boost euro-zone growth and bring inflation closer to its target of close to 2 percent. EBay rose 10 percent to $26.62 and Texas Instruments was up 9.5 percent at $56.85 after they reported better-than-expected third-quarter results late on Wednesday. Caterpillar fell 0.9 percent to $69.25 and 3M  fell 1 percent to $151.33 after the companies missed revenue estimates. Data showed U.S. unemployment benefits claims increased 3,000 to 259,000 last week, below the 265,000 expected. Existing home sales are expected to have grown 1.4 percent to an annual rate of 5.38 million units in September. The data is due at 10:00 a.m. The Federal Reserve, which kept interest rates unchanged at near-zero levels at a September meeting, has said it will wait for signs of global economic resilience before pulling the trigger. Valeant Pharmaceuticals continued its slide for a second day, falling 13.6 percent to $102.67. Community Health Systems sank 29 percent to $28.82 after it posted disappointing outlook. Other hospital operators Lifepoint, HCA Holdings and Tenet Healthcare  were also down 6 to 15 percent. American Express fell 5.9 percent to $72.03 after its quarterly profit missed estimates. Kinder Morgan slid 4.9 percent to $29.90 after the pipeline company said its dividend payout would slow next year. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,291 to 541.

Shares of Dow component McDonald’s jumped 7.5 percent to $110.20 premarket after its quarterly earnings and revenue beat estimates as demand recovered in China. Dow Chemicals rose 4.8 percent to $49.75 premarket, while Southwest Airlines rose 2.9 percent to $42.25 after both reported strong results. Technology majors Microsoft, Alphabet, AT&T; and Amazon are due to report after the close. “I think expectations are pretty low for everybody and that’s probably why you’re seeing some beats here,” said Tom Cassidy, chief investment officer at Girard Partners. Cassidy said the biggest factor for investors scrutinizing the reports would be revenue, which has been hurt by a slowing global economy and a stronger dollar. EBay rose 6.9 percent to $25.88 and Texas Instruments was up 7.6 percent at $55.85 after they reported better-than-expected third-quarter results late on Wednesday. At 8:35 a.m. ET (1235 GMT), S&P; 500 e-minis were up 7.5 points, or 0.37 percent, with 150,250 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 23.5 points, or 0.53 percent, on volume of 22,482 contracts. Dow e-minis were up 82 points, or 0.48 percent, with 22,695 contracts changing hands. Caterpillar fell 2.5 percent to $67.90 and 3M  fell 0.5 percent to $149.03 after the companies missed revenue estimates. The dollar index inched up after the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged. The index has risen roughly 5 percent this year. Data showed U.S. unemployment benefits claims increased 3,000 to 259,000 last week, below the 265,000 expected. Existing home sales are expected to have grown 1.4 percent to an annual rate of 5.38 million units in September. The data is due at 10:00 a.m. The Federal Reserve, which kept interest rates unchanged at near-zero levels at a September meeting, has said it will wait for signs of global economic resilience before pulling the trigger. U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday after a sharp slide in Valeant Pharmaceuticals weighed on healthcare stocks. Valeant’s shares were down 9.9 percent at $107.00 premarket. Community Health Systems sank 20.5 percent to $32.25 after it posted disappointing outlook. Other hospital operators Lifepoint, HCA Holdings and Tenet Healthcare  were also down 5 to 10 percent. American Express fell 3.9 percent to $73.49 after its quarterly profit missed estimates. Kinder Morgan slid 6.9 percent to $29.25 after the pipeline company said its dividend payout would slow next year.

914,MCD,McDonald's global same-restaurant sales rise,"Oct 22 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp reported its first rise in quarterly global same-restaurant sales in more than a year as demand recovered in China, where it had struggled after a food safety scandal, and menu changes boosted sales in the United States. The world’s biggest restaurant chain by sales said on Thursday that its global same-restaurant sales rose 4 percent in the third quarter. McDonald’s net income rose to $1.31 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30 from $1.07 billion, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 5.3 percent to $6.62 billion.

916,MCD,S&P; 500 ends at highest in two months; Alphabet up after hours,"(Reuters) - The S&P; 500 closed at its highest in two months on Thursday as stronger-than-expected earnings from several top companies, including McDonald’s, relieved investors’ concerns about the profit outlook. Buying accelerated after the close, with broad gains in tech and other companies that reported results, including Alphabet (GOOGL.O), up 9.6 percent at $746.78, and Microsoft (MSFT.O), up 7.2 percent at $51.50. Amazon (AMZN.O) rose 10.6 percent to $623.75 after it posted results. Nasdaq 100 futures NQc1 jumped after the close as well, and were up about 17 percent from the 2015 intraday low hit on Aug. 24. During the regular session, McDonald’s (MCD.N) shares jumped 8.1 percent to $110.87, giving the Dow its biggest boost, after its quarterly results beat estimates as demand recovered in China. EBay (EBAY.O) rose 13.9 percent to $27.58 after it reported better-than-expected results late on Wednesday.  Dow Chemical DOW.N rose 5.1 percent to $49.92 after its results, while the S&P; materials index .SPLRCM jumped 2.8 percent and led the S&P; sector gains along with the industrials .SPLRCI, also up 2.8 percent. In another sign of diminished concerns, the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX - the market’s favored barometer of volatility - closed at a 2-month low. “Corporate earnings certainly helped because the season started off sort of sluggish and you had some nice surprises today,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management Corp. in Chicago. Investors have been concerned about weak third-quarter earnings after some disappointing early results. S&P; 500 earnings still are estimated to have fallen 3.3 percent in the quarter compared with a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 320.55 points, or 1.87 percent, to 17,489.16, the S&P; 500 .SPX gained 33.57 points, or 1.66 percent, to 2,052.51 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 79.93 points, or 1.65 percent, to 4,920.05. Adding to the day’s optimism, ECB President Mario Draghi said the bank could extend its stimulus program beyond 2016 to boost euro zone growth and boost inflation closer to 2 percent. Data on Thursday showed new claims for U.S. unemployment benefits rose by 3,000 to 259,000 last week, below the 265,000 expected, while existing home sales increased more than expected to an annual rate of 5.55 million units in September. The Federal Reserve, which kept U.S. interest rates unchanged near zero in September, has said it will wait for signs of global economic resilience before pulling the trigger on its first rate hike in nearly a decade. Nine of the 10 major S&P; sectors were higher. Only healthcare .SPXHC appeared immune to the upbeat mood, declining about 0.5 percent. Community Health Systems (CYH.N) sank 35.1 percent to $26.30 after it gave a disappointing revenue outlook. It dragged down shares of other hospital operators.  Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,312 to 791, for a 2.92-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,777 issues rose and 1,001 fell for a 1.78-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. The S&P; 500 posted 41 new 52-week highs and 9 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 91 new lows. About 8.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 7.2 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

That move came just hours before fast-food leader McDonald’s Corp announced that its board amended company bylaws to provide shareholders with new rights of proxy access for director nominations. In a securities filing, JPMorgan said its board told management to prepare an amendment to grant groups of up to 20 shareholders the right to nominate their own candidates, a change known as “proxy access” that has become a popular reform at many companies this year. JPMorgan said the amendment would include a requirement that shareholders would need to have owned at least 3 percent of the company for three years, a common threshold and an approach the board requested. In addition, JPMorgan said its board has adopted a policy under which it would disclose whether it has recouped any incentive compensation from senior executives.

918,MCD,McDonald's asks judge to toss out U.S. labor board's 'massive' subpoena,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp has asked a U.S. judge to reject a subpoena from the National Labor Relations Board in its case claiming the company is a “joint employer” of franchise workers, saying the requests are unfair and costly. In a filing in U.S. court in Manhattan on Monday, McDonald’s said it had spent more than $1 million over the last few months producing over 160,000 pages of documents in response to the subpoena, even though the company says it will owe no more than about $50,000 if it is found liable for alleged labor violations at 29 franchises in five states. While McDonald’s is not facing a large payout to workers, the case is critically important to the fast food company and other franchisors, since a finding of joint employment would force them to bargain with unions and could impact the very basis of the franchise model. The NLRB’s general counsel, which is comparable to a prosecutor’s office, is seeking emails and other documents from more than 50 McDonald’s executives and employees who work directly with franchise owners. “The General Counsel’s subpoena to McDonald’s is, we believe, one of the most burdensome in the history of the agency,” the company’s lawyers wrote. The filing came ahead of a Thursday court hearing before U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon. A trial in the underlying case is scheduled to begin before an NLRB judge in New York in January. The dispute, which will likely end up before the five-member board and then federal appeals courts, could drag on for years, McDonald’s said on Monday. The general counsel’s subpoena also seeks information on McDonald’s involvement in countering union-backed nationwide protests seeking a $15 minimum wage for fast food workers, which it says could indicate a joint employment relationship. An NLRB spokeswoman said on Tuesday McDonald’s had caused “an unnecessary delay” in the case by challenging the subpoena. NLRB lawyers in court papers filed in September said the subpoena stemmed from evidence the general counsel had already uncovered suggesting McDonald’s exerts a significant amount of control over the working conditions of franchise employees. The board in an August decision in Browning-Ferris Industries Inc tossed out a 30-year-old standard defining joint employment as “direct and immediate control” over contract employees. The NLRB said that even the potential to control factors such as wages and discipline could be enough. The case is NLRB v.

922,MCD,Judge says McDonald's must give employee emails to U.S. labor board,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday gave McDonald’s Corp 30 days to hand over thousands of employee emails to a federal labor agency that says the company should be held liable for labor violations by franchisees. At a hearing Friday morning, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan accused the company of “playing games” in order to avoid complying with a subpoena from the National Labor Relations Board seeking documents from workers who deal directly with franchisees, which the company says would be irrelevant and costly. “You’re not even close to proving that the burden on McDonald’s would outweigh the relevance” of the documents, McMahon told the company’s lawyers.  The NLRB says McDonald’s is a “joint employer” of franchise workers because of the control it exerts over them through guidelines imposed on franchisees.  The case, which is scheduled to go to trial before an administrative judge in January, is expected to have a major impact on U.S. franchisors, potentially forcing them to bargain with unions and pay damages to workers for labor law violations by franchisees. McMahon on Friday also expressed impatience with the board, telling its lawyers they shouldn’t have waited until the eve of trial to seek enforcement of the broad subpoena, which includes nearly 200 separate requests. The judge rejected the board’s demand for records from several McDonald’s executives and information on the company’s response to a union-backed nationwide protest movement calling for a $15 minimum wage.  NLRB attorney Rachel See said an effort by the company to stifle the campaign could be proof of joint employment, but McMahon called that “a stretch.”  One of the company’s lawyers, Willis Goldsmith, said McDonald’s could not produce all of the remaining documents in 30 days, since the NLRB also wants employees’ personal emails, text messages and phone records. McMahon told the board it only needed work emails.

925,MCD,Panera moving to cage-free eggs by 2020,"(Reuters) - Bakery-cafe chain Panera Bread Co will stop using eggs laid by caged hens by 2020, following similar moves from McDonald’s Corp and other large U.S. restaurant chains. The commitment from Panera, a chain with more than 1,900 restaurants, comes as major U.S. restaurant companies are switching to meat and eggs from animals that are raised more humanely and fed fewer antibiotics.    Thursday’s egg announcement applies to the company’s U.S. Panera Bread and St. Louis Bread restaurants. It covers Panera’s  annual supply of roughly 120 million shell eggs, hard boiled and liquid egg whites in addition to those used in sweets, soufflés and dressings. The company said that 21 percent of the shell eggs, hard boiled and liquid egg whites it now uses already are cage-free.  Beyond that, Panera said the hens that lay the shell and hard boiled eggs it serves never receive antibiotics and are fed an all-vegetarian diet. This year, the company’s entire pork supply – about 7 million pounds – will be gestation-crate free, raised without antibiotics and fed a vegetarian-only diet. Panera also will complete its switch to 100 percent chicken and roasted turkey from birds raised without antibiotics in 2015. Meat producers are beginning to cut antibiotic use on the farm amid growing concern that the overuse of such drugs is contributing to rising numbers of life-threatening human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria known as “superbugs.” Panera has not yet set a target for completing its move to 100 percent grass-fed, free-range beef.

926,MCD,Panera moving to cage-free eggs by 2020,"Nov 5 (Reuters) - Bakery-cafe chain Panera Bread Co  will stop using eggs laid by caged hens by 2020, following similar moves from McDonald’s Corp and other large U.S. restaurant chains. The commitment from Panera, a chain with more than 1,900 restaurants, comes as major U.S. restaurant companies are switching to meat and eggs from animals that are raised more humanely and fed fewer antibiotics. Thursday’s egg announcement applies to the company’s U.S. Panera Bread and St. Louis Bread restaurants. It covers Panera’s  annual supply of roughly 120 million shell eggs, hard boiled and liquid egg whites in addition to those used in sweets, soufflés and dressings. The company said that 21 percent of the shell eggs, hard boiled and liquid egg whites it now uses already are cage-free. Beyond that, Panera said the hens that lay the shell and hard boiled eggs it serves never receive antibiotics and are fed an all-vegetarian diet. This year, the company’s entire pork supply - about 7 million pounds - will be gestation-crate free, raised without antibiotics and fed a vegetarian-only diet. Panera also will complete its switch to 100 percent chicken and roasted turkey from birds raised without antibiotics in 2015. Meat producers are beginning to cut antibiotic use on the farm amid growing concern that the overuse of such drugs is contributing to rising numbers of life-threatening human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria known as “superbugs.” Panera has not yet set a target for completing its move to 100 percent grass-fed, free-range beef. On Thursday, it said 89 percent of its roughly 4 million pound annual beef supply will meet that criteria this year.

The announcement came as executives at the world’s biggest fast-food company by sales laid out plans for luring back diners, cutting more costs, shifting restaurant ownership to franchisees and returning more cash to investors.

The agency lowered its rating to BBB+ from A- following the announcement and said it expects debt-to-Ebitda to increase to low to mid-3x in 2016-17, up from mid-2x currently. S&P; noted the “significant and rapid shift in financial policy” by McDonald’s, which also announced plans to increase its fourth-quarter dividend by 5%. “We think results will benefit from cost reductions, but we believe McDonald’s will continue to keep a high priority on allocating capital to shareholders, even as they execute on new strategies to improve operations in key markets,” it said. The reaction across the McDonald’s bond curve was mixed. The 3.375% May 2025s widened 9bp to a spread of 139bp, while other notes including the longer dated 4.6% May 2045s tightened between 5bp and 7bp, according to MarketAxess data.

930,MCD,"McDonald's investors hungry for news on breakfast, REIT, dividend","Nov 10 (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp is expected to announce early results from its domestic all-day breakfast push, give a verdict on whether it will spin off its U.S. real estate and announce a dividend increase at its investor meeting on Tuesday. Shares in the world’s biggest restaurant chain have been trading at record highs since Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said on Oct. 22 that a rebound in quarterly sales at established restaurants showed his turnaround plan was beginning to take hold. McDonald’s launched all-day breakfast on Oct. 6 in the United States, its top profit market. The move, hailed by so-called “breakfastarians,” has irked some restaurant operators. They complained in a survey that all-day breakfast has complicated kitchen operations, slowed service and prompted diners to choose less-expensive breakfast items over higher-priced lunch and dinner options. Still, the median estimate from 29 U.S. franchisees polled by Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski predicted that all-day breakfast would boost this quarter’s domestic same-restaurant sales by 1.5 percent. Analysts anticipated that the recent sales improvement should ease pressure on McDonald’s to put its U.S. properties into a real estate investment trust (REIT). That move has been promoted by activist investor Larry Robbins, CEO of Glenview Capital Management, who believes it could unlock more than $20 billion in value. Real estate historically has been an important part of McDonald’s business. The company collects rents from franchisees and those payments have increased 26 percent from 2009 to 2014. Last year, when company sales and profits dropped, rents accounted for more than 22 percent of McDonald’s total revenue. The “rent and royalty income we receive from franchisees provides a stable revenue stream that has relatively low costs and enables us to return significant cash to shareholders,” McDonald’s said in its 2014 annual report. Some experts say McDonald’s stellar credit rating could result in real estate returns that are too low to be attractive. And, the Internal Revenue Service recently signaled that REITs and other corporate spinoffs may violate rules aimed at preventing companies from avoiding taxes. “It’s difficult to see McDonald’s wanting to meaningfully change this successful long-term approach. That said, never say never!” said Kalinowski, who expects the chain to raise its quarterly dividend to 89 cents per share from 85 cents. Shares in the chain, whose New York City investor meeting was targeted by workers protesting for higher wages, were roughly flat at $113.14 in morning trading.

931,MCD,Fitch Affirms McDonald's IDR at 'BBB+'; Outlook Revised to Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) at 'BBB+/F2'.  The Rating  Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable. At Sept. 30, 2015, McDonald's  had approximately $18 billion of total debt. A full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Aggressive Financial Strategy The Negative Outlook reflects McDonald's aggressive financial strategy during a  period of challenged operating performance as the sustainability of recent  same-store sales (SSS) performance remains uncertain.  McDonald's cash flow priorities have consistently been to invest in its business  and return all remaining cash flow to shareholders. However, management is  demonstrating a growing willingness to utilize its balance sheet to increase  shareholder returns. Fitch views this as a change in financial strategy and  projects that total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will approximate the mid-3x range in  2016, up from 3.1x at Sept. 30, 2015 and 2.6x at Dec. 31, 2014.  Absent sustained improvement in SSS and meaningful progress with refranchising  and cost savings, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR could be sustained at or exceed  the mid-3.0x range beyond 2016, resulting in a downgrade in ratings.   Maintaining the current level of share buybacks beyond 2016 could also  contribute to a negative rating action.    McDonald's intends to return about $30 billion of cash to shareholders via  dividends and share repurchases during the three-year period ending 2016, with  $7 billion returned through the third quarter of 2015. The plan is $10 billion  higher than the company's previously articulated target with the vast majority  financed with additional debt. McDonald's already issued $4.2 billion earlier  this year to help accelerate share buybacks in 2015. Fitch assumes McDonald's  could issue an incremental $8 billion of debt within the next 12 months to meet  its new target.  Fitch currently assumes that McDonald's comps will stay in the low-single-digit  territory in 2016 and 2017 and EBITDA remains fairly stable to 2015 projected  levels of $9.1 billion.  Fitch's longer-term forecast incorporates a cumulative  $2 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of company units, gradual realization  of $500 million of G&A; expense savings, and that refranchising has only a modest  negative impact on operating income.  Sustainability of Recent SSS Performance Is Uncertain During the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2015, global SSS increased 4.0% with all  segments contributing. Comparable sales increased 0.9% in the U.S., 4.6% across  International Lead markets, 8.9% in High Growth markets, and 6.1% in  Foundational markets.  However, McDonald's is in the early stages of its turnaround plan.  The brand  continues to lose market share, particularly in the U.S. where McDonald's  reported a 3.2% comp gap to the quick-service sandwich category during the  September quarter. Global comparable guest counts are down 3.1% and 3.7% for the  nine- months ended September 2015 and September 2014, respectively.  Fitch views a cohesive and aggressive system-wide effort to improve service,  emphasize food quality and provide locally-relevant menu variety as necessary  catalysts for sustained SSS growth.  New Refranchising Target McDonald's intends to increase the percentage of its global system that is  franchised to 93% by the end of 2018 from 81% currently by selling 4,000 units  to operators. Longer term McDonald's strives to become 95% franchised.  Refranchising will mainly occur in McDonald's High Growth and Foundational  market segments which are currently 44% and 90% franchised, respectively. High  Growth markets include China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain,  Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Foundational markets include various countries  outside of the U.S. and International Lead markets (Australia, Canada, France,  Germany, and the U.K.).   Fitch views McDonald's decision to reduce the number of company-operated  restaurants as consistent with industry trends. Franchising increases the  stability and quality of cash flows, given that it produces a steady stream of  royalty and rental income and has low capital requirements. Fitch anticipates  that capital expenditures will decline meaningfully from approximately $2  billion expected for both 2015 and 2016, if the company successfully meets its  goal.  Increased Cost Reductions   McDonald's also raised its annualized year-end 2017 G&A; cost reduction target to  $500 million from $300 million. The goal represents nearly 20% of McDonald's  $2.6 billion expense base at the beginning of 2015. Savings will be realized  through refranchising, lower corporate overhead, and greater efficiencies across  global business services.  McDonald's expects to realize $150 million of savings by the end of 2016.  Fitch  anticipates savings to accelerate with the pace of refranchising and, along with  incremental royalty and rental-based income, to help offset operating income  declines associated with the sale of company-operated restaurants.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Positive low-single-digit SSS growth of about 2% in 2016 and beyond; --Operating income grows 5%-7% in 2016 and declines slightly thereafter due to  refranchising; --Total debt increases to, and is sustained at, about $26 billion;       --Free cash flow (FCF) approximates $1.5 billion in 2016; --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR (defined as total debt plus 8x gross  rents-to-operating EBITDA plus gross rents) in the mid-3.0x range in 2016.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --Weak SSS performance in 2016 and continued market share losses; --The lack of meaningful progress with refranchising and realization of cost  savings;  --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR sustained in the mid-3.0x range due  to weaker than expected operating results and share buybacks staying elevated in  2017.   Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a Stable  Outlook include:  --Several quarters of sustained positive low-single-digit SSS growth and  stabilization of market share; --Meaningful progress with refranchising and realization of cost savings; --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR sustained in the low-3.0x range. LIQUIDITY McDonald's liquidity is supported by its large cash balance, FCF (cash from  operations less capex and dividends), and an undrawn revolving credit facility  that expires December 2019. At Sept. 30, 2015, McDonald's had $5 billion of  liquidity consisting of $2.5 billion of cash and $2.5 billion revolver  availability.  FCF typically exceeds $1 billion annually and was $1.5 billion  for the nine months ended September 30.  Upcoming debt maturities include approximately $800 million in 2016 and about $1  billion in 2017. Fitch expects near-term debt maturities to be refinanced given  McDonald's shareholder-friendly activities. Fitch affirmed the ratings for McDonald's as follows:  --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+'; --Bank credit facilities at 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'.  The Rating Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable. Contact:  Primary Analyst Carla Norfleet Taylor, CFA  Senior Director +1-312-368-3195 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

938,MCD,"McDonald's hit with $355,000 in civil penalties in discrimination case","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp will pay $355,000 in civil penalties, undergo 20 months of monitoring and train its employees as part of a settlement of an immigration-related discrimination claim, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday. “The settlement agreement also requires McDonald’s to compensate lawful permanent resident employees of McDonald’s-owned restaurants who lost work or lost their jobs due to these documentary practices,” the Justice Department said in a statement. The agreement addresses actions by only McDonald’s, not its franchises, the department said. An investigation, based on information received on a department worker hotline, found McDonald’s required lawful permanent residents to show a new permanent resident card, commonly called a “Green Card,” when their original document expired, the statement said. This is not required by law, the statement said, and the investigation found McDonald’s, the world’s biggest restaurant chain, did not have a similar policy of asking its U.S. citizen employees to show new documents. McDonald’s said in a statement: “We deny any wrongdoing in this matter, but in order to avoid further expense, and ... to cooperate with the Office of Special Counsel, we reached a settlement.” The company values “diversity of thought, background and culture,” it said. Some of the permanent residents who were unable to provide a new card when asked by McDonald’s were not allowed to work or lost their jobs, the Justice Department said. Lawful permanent residents who worked for a corporate-owned McDonald’s  between Sept. 23, 2012, and March 1, 2015, may be eligible for compensation, the statement said.

942,MCD,EU set to investigate McDonald's tax deal with Luxembourg: sources,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are likely to launch a formal investigation into McDonald’s tax deal with Luxembourg, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday, widening the bloc’s crackdown on corporate tax avoidance. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager could announce the investigation as early as Thursday, the sources said, following on the heels of other recent cases, including deals between Luxembourg and carmaker Fiat and online retailer Amazon.com.  Labor unions and the charity War on Want, have accused McDonald’s of avoiding around 1 billion euros ($1 billion) in tax between 2009 and 2013 by routing revenue through a Luxembourg unit and have called for EU regulators to take action against the U.S. fast-food chain. McDonald’s, in a statement, said it had not been told of any EU investigation and that it complies with all tax laws and rules in Europe.  “From 2010-2014, the McDonald’s companies paid more than $2.1 billion just in corporate taxes in the European Union, with an average tax rate of almost 27 percent,” the company said. “Additionally, we pay social, real estate and other taxes. Our independent franchisees, who own and operate approximately 75 percent of our restaurants in Europe, also pay corporate tax and many other taxes.” The EU competition enforcer has been considering evidence regarding McDonald’s for some time, said a third source familiar with the issue. Corporate tax avoidance has become a hot political issue in Europe as deals that helped some multinationals slash their tax bills to as little as 1 percent or below have stirred public anger.  In October, Vestager ordered the Dutch government to claw back up to 30 million euros in back taxes from U.S. coffee chain Starbucks and told Luxembourg to do the same for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.  Cases against Apple’s Irish tax deal and Amazon’s arrangement in Luxembourg are also pending.  European Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso and Luxembourg’s finance ministry both declined to comment on the McDonald’s case.  The case will put the spotlight back on European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker as Luxembourg developed its favorable tax system during the near quarter-century that he served as finance minister or prime minister or held both jobs.

944,MCD,McDonald's under EU investigation over Luxembourg tax deals,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU regulators are to investigate tax deals between McDonald’s (MCD.N) and Luxembourg which enabled the U.S. chain to escape paying taxes on European franchise royalties from 2009, a move which could lead to hefty back taxes for the company. Confirming what sources with knowledge of the matter previously told Reuters, the bloc’s antitrust regulators said on Thursday they would launch the probe into arrangements which could be defined as illegal state aid. The investigation comes two months after the European Commission ordered Luxembourg to recover up to 30 million euros ($32 million) from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI), and the Dutch to do the same for Starbucks (SBUX.O), because of tax deals seen as unlawful aid. The EU competition enforcer said McDonald’s had not paid any corporate taxes in Luxembourg or the United States on royalties paid by franchisees in Europe and Russia since 2009, as a result of two tax rulings by the Luxembourg authorities. “We decided to open an investigation into two Luxembourg tax rulings to McDonald’s because we have the concern that those two rulings have resulted in ... double non-taxation, and that may be state aid,” Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager told Reuters.   “This is not a question of the Luxembourg tax regime or their rules, this is a question of how rules are actually applied,” Vestager said. Luxembourg’s finance ministry said the country had granted no special tax treatment or selective advantage to McDonald’s and would cooperate fully with the investigation. McDonald’s said it complied with all tax rules in Europe and that its companies had paid more than 2.1 billion euros in corporate taxes in the EU from 2010 to 2014, with an average tax rate of almost 27 percent. It also paid social, real estate and other taxes, while its independent franchises, operators of about 75 percent of its outlets, paid corporate and other taxes. “We are confident that the inquiry will be resolved favorably,” it said. In the United States, senior Treasury official Robert Stack told a Senate committee on Tuesday that the EU seemed to be singling out U.S. companies. “U.S. taxpayers would wind up footing the bill for these state aid settlements when the affected U.S. taxpayers either repatriate amounts voluntarily or Congress requires a deemed repatriation as part of tax reform,” Stack said. The Commission said McDonald’s Europe Franchising was exempted from paying taxes on this income in Luxembourg on the grounds that profits were subject to tax in the United States. But this was not the case when the ruling was granted in 2009.  In a second ruling, Luxembourg had agreed McDonald’s did not have to prove this income was subject to U.S. tax, the Commission said, adding Luxembourg had exempted the profits from tax despite knowing they were not subject to tax in the United States. The case presents yet another headache for Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, as Luxembourg developed its favorable tax system during the near quarter-century that he served as the Grand Duchy’s finance minister or prime minister. Junker has said he was not involved in any tax deals with individual companies but has also said he would take political responsibility for what happened in Luxembourg during his mandate. He has also said Vestager has the freedom to pursue any investigations she wished.

McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), the world’s biggest restaurant chain, and Yum Brands Inc’s (YUM.N) Taco Bell said this year that they will switch to eggs from cage-free birds.

Dunkin’s announcement on Monday came in a joint statement with the HSUS. Dunkin’ Brands said in May cage-free eggs will account for 10 percent of all eggs used in Dunkin’ Donuts breakfast sandwiches in the United States by the end of 2016.

948,MCD,McDonald's exploring sale of stake in Japanese arm: Nikkei,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) is reaching out to investors about selling a part of the fast-food company’s stake in its Japanese arm for about 100 billion yen ($826.2 million), the Nikkei business daily reported, without citing sources. A McDonald's executive recently traveled to Japan to talk with five or so potential buyers, including trading houses and investment funds, about selling 15-33 percent of McDonald's Holdings Co (Japan) Ltd's (2702.T) outstanding shares, the newspaper said. (s.nikkei.com/1PjDrBi) McDonald’s, which owns nearly half of the Japanese unit, has asked potential buyers to respond by mid-January, and the top candidate will likely be granted the right of first refusal, Nikkei said. McDonald’s was not immediately available to comment.     McDonald’s Japanese unit slid deep into losses in the first six months of the year, as customers stayed away after a string of safety scandals and the fast-food chain booked store closure and other restructuring costs, and forecast a full-year loss of 38 billion yen. Sales have been hit since a major Chinese supplier of chicken was found using expired meat last year. The business ran into problems again in January when some customers found foreign objects, including a tooth, in its food. McDonald’s Japanese unit was valued at $3.23 billion as of Monday’s close.

950,MCD,Italian groups seek EU antitrust probe into McDonald's,"BRUSSELS - Three Italian consumer organizations have urged EU antitrust regulators to investigate McDonald’s (MCD.N) franchise system in Europe, a month after the opening of an EU inquiry into the U.S. fast food company’s tax deals with Luxembourg. Codacons, Movimento Difesa del Cittadino and Cittadinanzattiva filed their complaint with the European Commission on Monday, urging the EU competition enforcer to step in and look at a system, which they alleged was anti-competitive. “The system construed by McDonald’s raises strong concerns under antitrust laws,” the group said in its 46-page complaint seen by Reuters.  Franchising is a key business model for the world’s largest fast food chain. The company made $9.27 billion in revenues from its franchised restaurants worldwide last year, accounting for about a third of overall turnover. Franchisees operate about 75 percent of McDonald’s outlets in Europe.  At issue are 20-year contracts which are twice as long as most other franchises, a requirement that licensees lease premises from McDonald’s at above-market rates and conditions hindering them from switching to competitors, the group says. “McDonald’s exercises an excessive and disproportionate control on its franchisees by implementing conditions that exceed without justification what is required for the protection of its system, its know-how and reputation,” the group said.  It said the restrictions hinder competition and lead to  consumers paying higher prices in franchised restaurants. It cited a survey which showed 97 percent of menu items cost more in franchises than in company-operated outlets in Bologna, while in Rome the figure was 68 percent and in Paris 71 percent. McDonald’s dismissed the criticism. “We are proud of our franchisees and are committed to working closely together so that they have the support they need to operate their restaurants and their businesses,” spokeswoman Joanna de Koning said in an email. “This approach, with the principle of sharing risk and reward, has been successful for many years and has helped create the best business opportunities for our franchisees and the best overall experience for our customers.” Commission spokeswoman Lucia Caudet said: “The Commission can confirm it has received the complaint, which it will now look into.”     The Italian consumer groups are backed by the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and European trade unions, whose complaint about suspected tax avoidance by McDonald’s prompted the European Commission to open an investigation into its tax arrangements with Luxembourg in December. The Commission is investigating the tax arrangements of multinational companies across the EU. “McDonald’s abuse of its dominant market position hurts everyone: franchisees, consumers, and workers. We strongly urge the European Commission to investigate the charges and to use all of its powers to hold McDonald’s accountable,” SEIU organizing director Scott Courtney said.  It is far from certain that the Commission will open a second investigation into the company. Complaints are usually followed by questionnaires sent to companies, after which the regulator determines whether there is cause for further action.

Russia’s economy, hit by weak oil prices and sanctions over Moscow’s role in the Ukraine crisis, contracted by 3.7 percent in 2015. Economic indicators suggest the slump is far from over and consumers, facing high inflation, may cut spending further. “The eating-out industry has been stagnating since the beginning of 2015 but we have seen significant growth of our market share as we continued expansion,” said Khamzat Khasbulatov, chief executive of McDonald’s Russia. The U.S. fast-food chain also picked up customers from other casual dining rivals as it deferred price increases when a slump in the rouble and Moscow’s ban on many Western foodstuff inflated the cost of supplies, he said. In 2016, it plans to open more than 60 restaurants, compared with 59 in 2015. The cost of investments in new openings and refurbishment of older restaurants will rise to about 9 billion rubles ($113 million) from 8 billion in 2015. Khasbulatov also said the company had fully recovered from an unprecedented series of regulatory checks in 2014 when it had to temporarily shut many of its restaurants. The closures were viewed broadly as a retaliation by Moscow for Western sanctions. The company had planned to spend 6 billion rubles in 2015 but exceeded that figure as it opened more restaurants than planned, although its profitability declined.  It did not give specific profit figures. “You cannot immediately offset a hike in (supplier) prices with an increase in menu prices, it’s a long process. Of course it hits profitability... but our profitability remains within acceptable limits,” Khasbulatov told Reuters at the company’s annual news conference. At a group level, McDonald’s reported better-than-expected quarterly same-restaurant sales as the launch of all-day breakfasts proved a hit with diners in the United States and demand continued to recover in China. McDonald’s, which has 543 restaurants in Russia, has over the past 26 years increased the share of local suppliers to 85 percent. Khasbulatov said it aimed eventually to source all supplies locally, helping smooth out the impact of currency swings and import restrictions.  “The development of local supply has played a big role in supporting our profitability. But it’s important to localize not only food processing but also production,” he said, adding he hoped to replace potato imports with local supplies after 2017.

The U.S. burger chain currently has 11 such outlets on the mainland, including in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Beijing, Regina Hui, senior director of communications for McDonald’s China said in an email received late on Thursday, in which she also disclosed the plans for the 150 restaurants. McDonald’s beat analyst forecasts for quarterly same-restaurant sales this week, adding momentum to a global recovery for the chain as demand picked up in China. Its same-store sales in China rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, the second straight quarter of growth after four quarters of falling sales. McDonald’s and Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N), the parent of KFC and Pizza Hut, are slowly turning things around in China, although same-restaurant sales for both firms remain below pre-scandal levels, according to a Reuters analysis of available data. The so-called ‘Create Your Taste’ outlets allow customers to build customized burgers from a wide selection of ingredients. Hui said the chain had seen “very positive feedback” from local diners, who analysts say are increasingly tough to win over due to greater health awareness and a boom in the range of available dining options. “They like the taste of burgers, the digital experience and the table service,” said Hui.  McDonald’s Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook launched a turnaround plan last year that involved making the menu simpler, improving service times and raising worker wages.

961,MCD,Dunkin' Donuts U.S. store sales fall as competition heats up,"(Reuters) - Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) reported a surprise drop in quarterly sales at established U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants as the launch of all-day breakfast by McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and value-meal offers by rivals lured customers away. Dunkin’ also said its plans to boost sales would take time to show results and it would continue to be impacted in 2016 by the “value price war” sparked by McDonald’s all-day breakfast. “It has obviously become very competitive so you have to believe there was some impact on us,” Dunkin’ Chief Executive Nigel Travis said on a conference call. Dunkin’ Donuts will introduce more premium espresso-based drinks such as Macchiatos to boost sales, Travis said. The chain also plans to bring new food items and beverages faster to market, and offer more value items on its menu.  Sales at stores open for at least 18 months fell 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 26, compared with a year earlier, a performance termed “disappointing” by Travis. Analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix were expecting sales to increase by 0.8 percent. The company’s Dunkin’ Donuts outlets in the United States account for about three quarters of its total revenue. Dunkin’ Brands reported a net loss attributable to the company of $8.9 million, or 10 cents per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $52.5 million, or 50 cents per share, in the same quarter of 2014.     The company said it took a $54.3 million impairment charge related to its Japanese joint venture. Excluding items, the company earned 52 cents per share, above analysts’ average estimate of 50 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 5.5 percent to $203.8 million, in line with the average analyst estimate of $203.3 million. The company forecast 2016 Dunkin’ Donuts U.S. comparable store sales to grow by up to 2 percent and Baskin-Robbins’ to rise by 1-3 percent. The company’s shares were down 1 percent at $40.46 in early trading on Thursday on the Nasdaq.

962,MCD,"Beefed up: McDonald's edging out KFC, Pizza Hut in China revival battle","* Yum’s China sales drop for first time in 2015 * China same-store sales improving for both brands * But analysis suggests McDonald’s recovery more robust * China diners particularly sensitive on chicken products * Headache for Yum with China unit spin-off due this year By Adam Jourdan SHANGHAI, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc, the home of KFC and Pizza Hut, is falling behind rival McDonald’s Corp  as the pair battle to revive flagging sales in China - a headache for Yum as it looks to spin off operations in its biggest market. A Reuters analysis of same-store sales data suggests McDonald’s is recovering faster in China than larger rival Yum as both seek to bounce back from a slew of food safety scandals dating back to 2012. McDonald’s said last week fourth-quarter same-store sales in China rose 4 percent, a second straight quarter of growth. On Wednesday, Yum said its same-store sales, reflecting underlying growth, also returned to growth in the second half - but more slowly, leaving annual China sales falling for the first time. Researchers and consumers said there’s no simple answer to explain why McDonald’s is faring better than Yum. A weaker economy and strengthening local rivals are among a complex cocktail of issues both firms must deal with in future strategy, including Yum’s China spinoff, due later this year. Yum is still the largest fast food chain in China, but McDonald’s has one in-built advantage: the country’s diners remain particularly sensitive about chicken products, which were at the heart of the scandal in 2012. “Hearing all the rumours about chickens, I now very rarely go to KFC or eat McDonald’s chicken wings.” said Yang Luo, 26, a sales manager in Shanghai. “Hamburgers are okay, though.” Yum’s 0.4 percent sales drop in 2015 in China, after two years of flatline growth, underlines how managers have struggled to repair its reputation. Chinese diners once flocked to its outlets - as well as to McDonald’s - helping drive revenue growth of nearly 30 percent each year between 2006 and 2012. “After the food scares erupted, me and my family didn’t go for a long time to these fast food chains,” said Zhao Ruoqing, 24, a student in the western Chinese city of Chengdu. “I’m not sure I totally trust either chain yet, but I now go to McDonald’s when I’m in a rush because I prefer the atmosphere,” said Zhao, adding he liked that the chain had maintained a more authentic American feel. The Reuters analysis of same-store sales data suggests McDonald’s is now outpacing Yum in efforts to restore sales to the level they were at before food safety crises. Same-store sales data reflects organic growth rather than that driven by new stores. The analysis, using same-store sales growth data to roughly track growth since a starting point in 2011, suggests Yum’s sales are below 80 percent of the level they were then. McDonald’s sales, meanwhile, are back to above 95 percent of that level. McDonald’s officials in China didn’t respond to requests for comment, while Yum China officials weren’t immediately available for comment. “The scandals have stuck to KFC much more than McDonald’s in consumers’ minds,” said James Roy, Shanghai-based associate principal at China Market Research Group. The problem for Yum as it looks to revive its growth momentum is there is no single factor behind its China malaise, a senior Yum executive told Reuters. That makes life complicated as Yum readies to split off its China business with a view to a separate listing, either in Hong Kong or the United States. “Everyone is looking for a silver bullet,” the executive said, asking not to be named as he wasn’t authorised to speak to the media. “All factors contribute - it’s a complex market.” ",2042016,http://www.reuters.com/article/yum-brands-china/beefed-up-mcdonalds-edging-out-kfc-pizza-hut-in-china-revival-battle-idUSL3N15G3L6

965,MCD,McDonald's announces belated foray into Kazakhstan market next month,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - McDonald’s (MCD.N) will open its first restaurant in Kazakhstan in March and another 15 soon afterward in a belated foray into Central Asia’s largest economy, a company executive and its Kazakh licensee said on Thursday. After more than a decade of deliberations, the U.S. fast-food giant will launch an outlet in the Kazakh capital Astana on March 8 after investing $3.5 million in the franchise project, according to Khamzat Khasbulatov, president of McDonald’s Russia unit, which will support the expansion into Kazakhstan.    The Kazakh development licensee for McDonald’s will be Kairat Boranbayev, a local businessman and relative of veteran Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has been at the helm of the former Soviet republic since 1989. “Kairat had been asking me this question - why are we not coming to Kazakhstan for such a long time?” Khasbulatov told a news conference in Moscow. “All logistics are now located closely to Kazakhstan and there will be synergy with Belarus.” Russia’s first McDonald’s restaurant opened in Moscow in 1990, a year before the break-up of the Soviet Union, and it now has a total of 545 outlets. There are 11 McDonald’s in adjacent ex-Soviet republic of Belarus. Boranbayev was previously involved in Kazakhstan’s gas business and his daughter is married to Nazarbayev’s grandson. Khasbulatov did not respond to a question whether Boranbayev’s personal connections to the Kazakh leader would help develop the McDonald’s branch of restaurants in Kazakhstan. Once it appears in Kazakhstan, McDonald’s is likely to face a strong challenge from other international fast-food giants like KFC (YUM.N) and Burger King, which have well-established restaurant chains in the steppe nation of 17 million people.

The company said it would open 250 restaurants per year in China, where it currently operates more than 2,200 outlets, as it focuses on high-growth markets to boost sales. McDonald’s said it would add another 250 outlets in Hong Kong and South Korea over the same period and was seeking franchise partners in the all three markets, where it now has more than 2,800 restaurants. “Asia still offers by far the largest long-term growth opportunity in global foodservice,” Euromonitor International  analyst Elizabeth Friend told Reuters. China, Hong Kong and South Korea, along with other high-growth markets such as Russia, accounted for nearly a quarter of McDonald’s total sales in 2015. McDonald’s, which converted about 470 company-owned restaurants to franchises last year, plans to franchise 95 percent of its outlets worldwide in the long-term. More than 80 percent of its 36,000-plus restaurants are currently operated by franchisees. Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s said it was looking for partners who would “enable localized decisions on growth initiatives” in China, Hong Kong and South Korea. McDonald’s and rival Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N), the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, have been facing increasing competition from cheaper local rivals, particularly in China, where they are trying to recover from food safety scares. China, which is home to the third largest number of McDonald’s restaurants, is Yum’s biggest market. Sales took a hit after Chinese regulators launched a probe into a local meat supplier in 2014 for allegedly mixing meat beyond its expiration date with fresh meat. McDonald’s will have to focus on winning back public support and tailoring its food to local flavors, while preserving some of its Western appeal, Friend said. “It’s a difficult balance.” A Reuters analysis of same-store sales data suggests McDonald’s is recovering faster than Yum in China.

The U.S. fast food giant is adopting a new business model in Asia, which is now the most intense battleground for global restaurant chains, by planning to bring in partners to own the restaurants within a franchise operation. Several other global restaurant operators have switched to the so-called franchise model and McDonald’s has also set a long-term aim of being 95 percent franchised, the company said in a statement on March 31. Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald’s has hired Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to run the sale of the restaurants in China, Hong Kong and South Korea, the people said. A formal sales process is expected to kick-off in about three to four weeks, one of the people said. Ahead of that, McDonald’s and its advisor are drawing up a list of likely partners who will be approached to participate in the auction, the person added. The franchise partners would likely end up owning a majority stake in the restaurants in each market, or even as much as 100 percent, and be responsible for future capital spending. The precise structure of the deal is still to be decided, the sources said. In return, McDonald’s will get a one-time franchise payment and ongoing royalty fees, which usually range between 3-5 percent of annual turnover. Asia-focused Baring Private Equity Asia is the other buyouts firm likely to be invited to the auction process, banking sources familiar with the process said. McDonald’s declined to add to the March 31 statement. China Resources, MBK, Bain, TPG and Baring all declined to comment. Morgan Stanley didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. McDonald’s does not break out country-by-country revenue details. It is China’s No. 2 fast food chain behind YUM Brands Inc (YUM.N), which operates the KFC and Pizza Hut chains. McDonald’s is leaning towards finding separate partners in all the three markets and would likely offer a majority stake to make the deal appealing to buyers, the people added. The private equity firms are attracted to the rapid growth opportunity available in the so-called quick-service restaurants’ (QSR) business in Asia. “In recent years, even though formal dining may have been impacted by the austerity measures, QSR as a format is growing pretty rapidly,” said Kiki Yang, a Greater China partner at consulting firm Bain & Co. “QSR has the format that a lot of investors like because of the growth of the segment, standardized procedures and it’s easy to expand.” China Resources (Holdings), which is the parent of brewing company China Resources Beer Holdings (0291.HK), and operates Pacific Coffee chains in Hong Kong, China, Singapore and Macau, has previously expressed interest in expanding its retail footprint. “This will attract a lot of sponsor interest,” said one senior Hong Kong-based M&A; banker familiar with the McDonald’s process. “For one, it’s an established business and second such assets rarely come to market in Asia.” Buyout firms from KKR & Co (KKR.N) to Carlyle Group (CG.O) and others have raised billions of dollars in new funds in Asia to benefit from the region’s growth potential. But the lack of opportunities to gain control of businesses and stiff asking prices have left the Asia private equity industry sitting on about $140 billion of “dry powder” or unemployed capital, according to data provider Preqin. Apart from the proceeds from a sale, a deal would lower McDonald’s capital spending needs, which totaled $2.6 billion last year. McDonald also plans to open 1,500 more restaurants in China and Hong Kong over the next five years, to tap the region’s rapid growth.  However, McDonald’s and Yum, have been facing increasing competition from cheaper local rivals, particularly in China, where they are both trying to recover from food safety scares. Yum is also in the process of spinning off its 6,900 China restaurants, and is in talks with buyouts firms, including KKR and Hopu Investments to sell up to a 20 percent stake after battling sliding sales over the past few quarters.  Bruised by food safety scandals and changing tastes, McDonald’s is also selling a big stake in its Japanese arm.  Buyout firms, including Bain Capital, Permira [PERM.UL] and MBK, were among those who submitted bids for the McDonald’s Japan stake earlier this year, though it was unclear if a deal is close. All three buyout firms declined comment. McDonald’s has struggled in Japan over the past two years, closing more than 150 restaurants last year, remodeling almost 3,000 and posting a $310 million net loss in 2015. McDonald’s owns 49.99 percent of its Japanese arm McDonald’s Holdings (2702.T), according to the company’s website, and intends to cut that to about 20 percent.

978,MCD,"REFILE-China's CIC, KKR consortium in talks to buy control of Yum China unit -sources","(Adds missing word in first paragraph) HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, April 20 (Reuters) - A group of investors comprising sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp (CIC), KKR & Co and Baring Private Equity Asia is in talks to buy a controlling stake in Yum Brands Inc’s  China unit, people familiar with the matter said. Yum Brands, owner of the Pizza Hut and KFC fast food chains plans to spin off its 6,900 China restaurants by the end of 2016. The China unit accounts for about half of its parent’s total sales and is valued at about $10 billion, based on its core earnings, bankers and analysts estimate. The U.S.-based company had initially planned to sell a stake of about 20 percent in the China operation to anchor investors ahead of a planned listing of the business in New York Exchange and possibly in Hong Kong. But the deal structure is being reworked as acquiring a minority stake is less appealing for buyout firms, making it difficult for them to secure debt funding to finance the deal. It wasn’t immediately clear how much the investor group plans to pay for Yum’s China business. Bloomberg first reported the news and said the deal could vale Yum China at between $7 billion-$8 billion.. According to people familiar with the transactions, speaking on condition of anonymity because the talks were confidential, it was unclear whether Yum would agree to sell a majority stake, as disposing of more than 20 percent of the China business would attract a higher tax bill. Yum, still the largest fast food chain in China, has been losing ground to McDonald’s Corp as both strive to revive flagging sales in the teeth of growing competition from local rivals and a slowing economy. McDonald’s itself is changing its business model in Asia by planning to bring in partners to own a majority of its restaurants within a franchise operation. Chinese diners once flocked to Yum outlets - and to McDonald’s - helping drive revenue growth of nearly 30 percent a year between 2006 and 2012. But Yum’s China sales dipped 0.4 percent in 2015, after two flat years, underlining how managers have struggled to repair its reputation since the food safety scares. CIC, KKR and Baring declined to comment. Yum said in a statement that it is making good progress since it announced the planned separation of Yum and Yum China and will provide updates on the transaction at appropriate times. It didn’t comment on any potential deal with the group of investors. Yum shares dropped 0.6 percent on Tuesday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3 percent.

979,MCD,"All-day breakfast, promotions drive McDonald's profit beat","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s (MCD.N) quarterly earnings jumped more than expected in the latest quarter, as all-day breakfasts and new meal deals lured more diners to its U.S. restaurants which contribute about 40 percent of overall profit. Shares in the world’s largest fast-food chain are up nearly 28 percent from a year ago, when then-new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook launched a turnaround plan that has included simplifying sprawling menus and improving speed and service to counter intense competition from the likes of Burger King (QSR.TO), Dunkin’ Donuts (DNKN.O) and Shake Shack Inc (SHAK.N).  Sales at McDonald’s U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months grew 5.4 percent in the first quarter, outpacing the 4.6 percent gain expected by analysts, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.  All-day breakfast, launched in October, has been a hit with U.S. customers looking for thrifty options.  The company also got a lift from a $5 McPick promotional offer, which allowed diners to choose two items from a menu that included the Big Mac and Quarter Pounder with Cheese. “Customers in the U.S. are noticing a difference,” Easterbrook said on a conference call with analysts and investors. He added that McDonald’s plans to stick with its current turnaround plan for at least two more quarters before transition to a longer-term strategy.  While the first-quarter results topped Wall Street estimates, Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan cautioned that McDonald’s continues to expect variability in quarterly results, due to regional economic challenges and other factors.  McDonald’s global sales at established restaurants rose 6.2 percent, the biggest leap in three quarters. That was due, in part, to strength markets such as China, Japan and Russia.  The net income attributable to McDonald’s rose to $1.1 billion, or $1.23 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.16 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Net revenue fell 1 percent to $5.90 billion, but topped the average estimate of $5.82 billion. The revenue decline was the smallest in seven quarters. Excluding the impact of a strong dollar, revenue rose 3 percent.  McDonald’s, which also has been closing poorly performing units, selling company-run restaurants to independent operators and cutting overhead, said total operating costs fell nearly 10 percent.

985,MCD,Fitch Rates McDonald's EUR2.5B Debt Issuance 'BBB+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to  McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) multi-tranche debt issuance. The Rating  Outlook is Negative. The EUR2.5 billion issuance includes four-year, seven-year,  and twelve-year fixed-rate senior unsecured notes. At Dec. 31, 2015, McDonald's  had $24 billion of total debt. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release. The notes, which rank pari passu with existing debt, are being issued under  McDonald's U.S. global medium-term notes program dated Nov. 13, 2014. Terms do  not include financial covenants. Proceeds will be used for general corporate  purposes, inclusive of share repurchases. McDonald's ratings balance the company's aggressive financial strategy with its  substantial cash flow, significant scale, and the strength of its brand. Key  rating drivers include on-going comp trends, the company's financial strategy,  and continued progress with refranchising and cost reduction efforts. Fitch  projects total debt/EBITDA and total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will be sustained in  the high-2.0x and mid-3.0x range, respectively, over the intermediate term. KEY RATING DRIVERS Sustainability of Recent Positive Comparable Sales Trend McDonald's global comparable sales (comps) have increased at a mid-single-digit  rate for three consecutive quarters, rising 6% in the quarter ended Mar. 31,  2016, after being negative for two consecutive years. All segments are  contributing to the recent improvement. Comps increased 5.4% in the U.S., 5.2%  across International Lead markets, 3.6% in High Growth markets, and 11% in  Foundational markets in the latest quarter. Consolidated guest counts rose 1.8%. Fitch believes McDonald's is making meaningful progress with its turnaround plan  and that recent comp strength can be attributed in part to the launch of All-Day  Breakfast in the U.S., a renewed focus on restaurant operations, and a continued  focus on value around the world. Fitch expects at least 3% growth in 2016 due to  continued consumer excitement around All-Day Breakfast, the company's current  Monopoly promotion in the U.S., and the pending launch of a national value  platform. Whether at least 2% comp growth can be sustained over time will become  more evident as the company laps easy prior year comparisons.  Aggressive Financial Strategy, Increased Leverage In November 2015, McDonald's announced plans to increase cash returned to  shareholders via dividends and share repurchases to about $30 billion during the  three-year period ending 2016, up from $20 billion previously. The company has  issued approximately $12.6 of incremental debt over the past year to help fund  the cash-return goal. Fitch assumes debt will be sustained at around the current  level over the near term and projects total debt/EBITDA and total adjusted  debt/EBITDAR will be approximately 2.8x and 3.6x, respectively, for 2016.  Shift Toward a Higher Mix of Franchised Units McDonald's intends to increase the percentage of its global system that is  franchised to 93% by the end of 2018 from 81% currently by selling 4,000 units  to operators. Longer term McDonald's strives to become 95% franchised.  Refranchising will mainly occur in McDonald's High Growth and Foundational  market segments which are currently 46% and 91% franchised, respectively. High  Growth markets include China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain,  Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Foundational markets include various countries  outside of the U.S. and International Lead markets (Australia, Canada, France,  Germany, and the U.K.). McDonald's has refranchised about 700 units over the  past five quarters. Fitch views McDonald's shift towards a higher mix of franchised units as  consistent with industry trends. Franchising increases the stability and quality  of cash flows, given that it produces a steady stream of royalty and rental  income and has low capital requirements. This assumes franchisees remain  financially healthy, continue to invest in their operations, and drive positive  growth. Fitch anticipates that capital expenditures will decline meaningfully  from approximately $2 billion expected for 2016, if the company successfully  meets its goal.  Significant Cost Reductions McDonald's is targeting $500 million of annualized G&A; cost reductions with the  vast majority being realized by the end of 2017. The goal represents nearly 20%  of McDonald's $2.6 billion expense base at the beginning of 2015. Savings will  be realized through refranchising, lower corporate overhead, and greater  efficiencies across global business services. The company expects to realize  $150 million of savings by the end of 2016. Fitch anticipates savings to  accelerate with the pace of refranchising and, along with incremental royalty  and rental-based income, to help offset operating income declines associated  with the sale of company-operated restaurants.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Positive low-single-digit SSS growth of about 3% in 2016 and 2% beyond; --Operating income grows at a high-single-digit rate in 2016 but increases at a  slower rate thereafter due to refranchising; --Total debt is sustained in the $26 billion range in 2016;  --Free cash flow (FCF) is approximately $1 billion - $1.5 billion annually; --Total debt/EBITDA and total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR (defined as  total debt plus 8x gross rents-to-operating EBITDA plus gross rents) are  sustained in the high 2.0x and mid-3.0x range, respectively, over the  intermediate term.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --Fitch's view that McDonald's can sustain positive low-single-digit SSS and  that market share has stabilized; --Continued meaningful progress with refranchising and realization of cost  savings; --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR sustained in the low-3.0x range.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --The inability to sustain positive comps which would indicate market share  losses; --The lack of meaningful progress with refranchising and realization of cost  savings due to higher than expected investments in the business being an offset;  --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR sustained in the mid-3.0x range due  to weaker than expected operating results and share buybacks.  LIQUIDITY AND MATURITIES McDonald's liquidity is supported by its large cash balance, free cash flow  (FCF; cash from operations less capex and dividends), and an undrawn revolving  credit facility that expires December 2019. At Dec. 31, 2015, McDonald's had  $10.2 billion of liquidity consisting of $7.7 billion of cash, the majority of  which is expected to be deployed to share buybacks, and $2.5 billion revolver  availability. FCF typically exceeds $1 billion annually and was $1.5 billion for  2015. Aggregate maturities of long-term debt over the next three years at Dec.  31, 2015 are approximately $1.1 billion in 2017 and $1.8 billion in 2018. No  maturities exist for 2016. Fitch anticipates debt will be refinanced given  McDonald's shareholder-friendly financial strategy.  McDonald's current ratings are as follows:  --Long-term IDR 'BBB+'; --Bank credit facilities 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'BBB+'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2'.  The Rating Outlook is Negative.

986,MCD,McDonald's testing new Chicken McNuggets in two U.S. markets,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) said it is testing new recipes for its staple Chicken McNuggets snack in some U.S. markets to cater to growing consumer demand for healthier food.

McDonald’s did not detail the specific ingredients in the new nuggets, but said it was a recipe “parents can feel good about.”      The nuggets being tested in Portland do not contain any artificial preservatives, the company said in an emailed statement.   McDonald’s also did not say whether it would roll out the new recipes nationally.

990,MCD,McDonald's probes copycat burger joint in separatist east Ukraine,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The McDonald’s (MCD.N) fast food chain said its lawyers were investigating after entrepreneurs in separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine started selling McDonald’s-style hamburgers out of a restaurant that the company shut down two years ago. The company said it pulled out of the Ukrainian city of Luhansk in May 2014 for security reasons after pro-Russian insurgents mounted an armed uprising there against Kiev’s rule, and unilaterally declared the region’s independence. But since then, the company said, the restaurant premises in Luhansk was unlawfully taken over. Photographs sent to Reuters by a witness on Friday showed the restaurant was now open and selling fries and burgers that look similar to those served in McDonald’s restaurants worldwide.  All McDonald’s branding and logos had, however, been removed from the restaurant.  On the outside of the building, the McDonald’s sign had been doctored to leave only the letters “Mc”, and the blue-red-and-light blue flag of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic was attached to the roof. “Our lawyers are working on this issue,” said a spokeswoman for McDonald’s in Ukraine. The region around Luhansk and the neighboring city of Donetsk are under Kiev’s rule in the eyes of international law but are de facto under the control of separatist administrations which are not internationally recognized. The United States and European Union imposed sanctions on many of the separatist leaders, and their backers in Russia, alleging they colluded to unlawfully seize the territory. The separatists and Moscow said they had to act to protect their regions from persecution by Kiev. The region’s unrecognized status makes enforcing property rights enshrined in international law difficult. Photographs posted on social media this week showed the Luhansk restaurant selling food wrapped in McDonald’s branded packaging, but Reuters could not immediately verify their authenticity.  On Friday, the packaging being used carried no McDonald’s branding, and customers were instead being offered plain white plastic bags in which to take their orders home. The spokeswoman for McDonald’s Ukrainian operation said no one had asked the company if they could re-open the branch in Luhansk.  “The illegal use of trademarks, names and images of products that belong to McDonald’s is an example of the violation of the company’s intellectual property rights,” she added. “In such cases, the corporation reserves the right to resolve questions of the illegal use of the company’s names or images using the means set out by law.” It was not clear who was operating the business in the McDonald’s restaurant in Luhansk. People answering the phone at two numbers listed for the restaurant said they had no connection to the business. An official in the legal department of the separatists’ trade ministry in Luhansk said he knew nothing about the issue and that officials had taken no action.

The company was co-founded with Spotify in 2013 in Sweden, where it provides tailor-made music playlists for customers such as Nike and Starbucks.  It targets small businesses and large chains with the pitch that music can keep customers in-store longer and boost sales. The deal with McDonald’s allows Soundtrack Your Brand to sign up its franchisees worldwide and provide them with playlists on pre-approved terms. In Sweden, over 60 percent of McDonald’s restaurants are using the service.

The program presented by John Cisna, author of the book “My McDonald’s Diet: How I lost 37 pounds in 90 days and became a viral media sensation,” was sharply criticized by teachers, parents and public health advocates who accused McDonald’s of trying to hook youngsters on unhealthy food. Cisna’s program included a documentary and discussion guide edited by McDonald’s, which hired him in 2015 and provides him with a stipend for time and travel related to his speaking engagements. His presentations came shortly after the new CEO of the 60-year-old chain had begun working to transform McDonald’s into a “modern, progressive burger company.”  “As our brand ambassador, John is focused on internal and local community events, and he is not appearing at schools,” McDonald’s said in a statement.

994,MCD,Workers plan major round of protests for McDonald's annual meeting,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Spurred by recent successes, U.S. low-wage workers next week plan to make McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and its annual shareholder meeting the target of major protests calling for $15 per hour and the right to unionize. The union-backed “Fight for $15” campaign on Thursday said the actions will start with a Chicago fast-food worker strike on May 25. That same day, it will kick off two days of protests at McDonald’s headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, where the fast-food company will host its annual meeting on May 26. Organizers said the Oak Brook protest will be bigger and more aggressive than ever before.  The campaign since 2012 has had a key role in convincing some lawmakers and major employers to boost long-stagnant minimum wages and explore other ways to improve working conditions for scores of Americans whose jobs range from flipping hamburgers to caring for the elderly. Ke’Jioun Johnson, 20, works at a McDonald’s restaurant in uptown Chicago and plans to join the protests for the second year in a row.  Johnson’s pay went from $8.25 to $10 per hour in July after Chicago began phasing in a hike that will take the city’s minimum wage to $13 by 2019.  While he is inspired by pay victories in his hometown and states like California and New York, Johnson said much more needs to be done to protect workers.  For example, he and other restaurant and retail workers want to stop employers’ cost-saving practice of cutting short scheduled shifts when business is slow.  “We’re not just about $15 per hour. We’re going to keep fighting until we get union rights,” said Johnson. “It’s what we need to survive - a living wage and the hours to live off of.”  McDonald’s Corp in July raised the average pay and began offering paid vacations and other benefits for the roughly 90,000 workers in the U.S. restaurants it operates. Most McDonald’s workers, however, are employed by franchisees.  They company’s stock is trading near all-time highs, spurred by a profit-boosting turnaround plan that includes all-day breakfast. McDonald’s did not immediately comment for this story. Business owners who oppose pay hikes say the additional expense puts jobs at risk.  Workers like Johnson argue that well-compensated workers do a better job. That could make a big difference at a fast-food chain, where every second of speed matters.   “If we’re feeling good and energized, everything flows smooth,” Johnson said.

996,MCD,"UPDATE 1-Temasek, CIC-KKR advance to 2nd round of Yum China stake sale -sources","NEW YORK/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings and a consortium that includes China Investment Corp (CIC) and KKR & Co (KKR.N) have advanced to a second round of bidding for a minority stake in Yum Brands Inc’s  (YUM.N) China unit, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Another private equity-backed consortium has also moved to the second round, the people said, although its identity could not be immediately confirmed.    Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum Brands, owner of the Pizza Hut and KFC fast food chains, aims to spin off its 7,205 China restaurants by the end of 2016, amid pressure from activist investor Corvex Management, whose founder, Keith Meister, is on Yum’s board. The second round of bids for the stake up for sale - around 20 percent of the business - are due by the end of this month, the people said, declining to be identified because the information was confidential. Yum’s entire China unit is valued between $8 billion and $11 billion, based on its core earnings of about $1 billion, the people said. “I will tell you as a large shareholder, the Yum board selling this business for $7 or $8 billion is not the right thing, and I don’t think anyone would disagree about that,” Corvex’s Meister told CNBC in a recent interview. Corvex owns 5.2 percent of Yum, according to Thomson Reuters data. Yum, still the largest fast food chain in China, has been losing ground to McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) as they both strive to revive flagging sales in the teeth of growing competition from local rivals and a slowing economy. In the latest quarter, Yum’s China sales grew faster than Wall Street estimates, raising expectations that a key profit driver for Yum is showing signs of stability after battling many quarters of disappointing sales. Yum shares haven risen 9.7 percent in New York so far this year, while the S&P; 500 Index .SPX has been flat in the same period. Some bidders would be keen to buy control of the China business, the people said, but they noted that Yum is sticking to the minority stake sale plan because it is more tax-efficient. It was not clear if these bidders would pursue a transaction if Yum does not adjust plans and offer a controlling stake for sale, the people said. A Yum spokeswoman declined to comment on prospective bidders. She said, “We continue to make good progress since we announced the transaction separating Yum and Yum China into powerful, independent, focused companies by the end of 2016.”  KKR and Temasek declined to comment. China sovereign wealth fund CIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While Temasek, which manages about $190 billion in assets, has about 28 percent of its portfolio in the financial sector, it has been placing more bets in consumer companies of late. In 2014, it bought almost a quarter of health and beauty retailer A.S. Watson, backed by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, for about $5.7 billion in its single biggest investment.  Last year it was also part of a private equity consortium led by MBK Partners that bought British supermarket retailer Tesco PLC’s (TSCO.L) South Korea business.

997,MCD,McDonald's closes headquarters due to expected worker protests,"CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp said on Wednesday it temporarily closed its suburban Chicago headquarters for a third year in a row as fast-food workers plan to protest at the company’s annual shareholders meeting with calls for wages of at least $15 an hour and union rights. The company will host the annual shareholders meeting at its Oak Brook, Illinois, headquarters on Thursday, with security personnel in attendance as usual, spokeswoman Lisa McComb said. Protest organizers said the annual meeting actions, scheduled to run from Wednesday evening through Thursday morning, will be the biggest and most aggressive of their kind thus far. McDonald’s encouraged employees to work from home on Wednesday, McComb said in an email. The “Fight for $15” campaign, which is backed by the  Service Employees International Union, since 2012 has had a hand in convincing some lawmakers and big employers to boost minimum wages and improve working conditions. The union represents workers ranging from fast-food restaurants to home health aides. McDonald’s last July raised average hourly pay and began offering paid vacations and other benefits for the roughly 90,000 workers at its company-operated U.S. restaurants. “At McDonald’s, we take seriously our role in helping strengthen communities,” providing many with their very first job,” McComb said. As one of the world’s largest and most recognizable companies, McDonald’s is the target of frequent protests. It says it cannot tell its franchisees how to pay their employees. Almost 90 percent of McDonald’s 14,000 U.S. restaurants are operated by franchisees. McDonald’s recently revived its business with a turnaround plan that included selling breakfast all day in the United States. While executives and shareholders have reaped rewards via salary hikes and gains in the stock price, front-line workers say they have not shared in the wealth. “Corporations ought to invest in workers so they don’t need food stamps, subsidized housing and other benefits,” SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said.

1000,MCD,"McDonald's CEO says $15 hourly wage, robots won't kill jobs","OAK BROOK, Ill./LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. restaurant operators would probably not replace workers with robots if they had to pay the $15 hourly wage demanded by protesters, McDonald’s Corp Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook told shareholders at the company’s annual meeting on Thursday. Outside the meeting at McDonald’s headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, about 1,000 fast-food workers and their supporters called for higher wages and benefits. The picketers are part of a national “Fight for $15” movement that, along with an improving job market, has spurred wage hikes at major employers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc and McDonald’s, though not to the level demanded by protesters. Current and former fast-food executives have said a $15 hourly wage would force restaurants to replace workers with kiosks, robotic french fry baggers, automatic pancake flippers and other technology. “I don’t see it being a risk to job elimination,” Easterbrook said when asked about the wage/robot theory. “Ultimately we’re in the service business. We will always have an important human element.”  Easterbrook has cited improved customer service as a key reason for McDonald’s recent turnaround. Higher pay and technological advances are more likely to result in workers being shifted to dining rooms and more service-oriented roles, he said.   McDonald’s last summer increased average worker pay to almost $10 per hour. But those raises were limited to just a fraction of all U.S. McDonald’s restaurant workers because franchisees operate almost 90 percent of the chain’s 14,000 domestic locations. Protesters, who also seek the right to unionize, called on Easterbrook to share profit gains with all McDonald’s workers, not just executives and shareholders. They have protested at the company’s annual meeting for years. This week, their actions prompted McDonald’s to temporarily close its headquarters for the third year in a row.  “This comes down to holding McDonald’s accountable for keeping workers in poverty,” said Naquasia LeGrand, 24, who traveled 15 hours on a chartered bus from North Carolina, where she makes $8.15 an hour as a McDonald’s swing manager.  Angel Mitchell, a McDonald’s worker from Chicago, spent a rain-soaked night camping out at the company’s headquarters. “We can’t feed our own families without turning to food stamps,” Mitchell said. McDonald’s says it cannot tell its franchisees how to pay their employees. The issue is the subject of a closely watched case before the National Labor Relations Board.  The “Fight for $15” campaign is backed by the Service Employees International Union and also includes people who work in home care, child care, airports and higher education. Also at the meeting, investors voted down a slate of shareholder resolutions, including those involving disclosure of political contributions and antibiotic use in meat production.

1003,MCD,McDonald's French HQ searched in tax probe: sources,"PARIS (Reuters) - French investigators searched McDonald’s (MCD.N) French headquarters on May 18, targeting the U.S. fast food chain in a tax probe, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday. A preliminary inquiry had been opened early this year after former investigating magistrate and politician Eva Joly filed a lawsuit in December on behalf of an employee committee, a judicial source said. “A search was indeed carried out at McDonald’s headquarters in France on May 18,” the other source said, confirming a report first carried by Les Echos business daily. The judicial source said that “many documents” had been seized during the raid. French business magazine L’Expansion reported last month that authorities had sent McDonald’s France a 300 million euro  ($336 million) bill for unpaid taxes on profits believed to have been funneled through Luxembourg and Switzerland. It said tax officials had accused the giant U.S. burger chain of using a Luxembourg-based entity, McD Europe Franchising, to shift profits to lower-tax jurisdictions by billing the French division excessively for use of the company brand and other services. The judicial source confirmed the investigation was looking into this. McDonald’s declined to comment on the search, referring back to past comments that it is proud to be one of the biggest tax payers in France.

1004,MCD,Workers protest at McDonald's shareholder meeting for second day,"OAK BROOK, Ill., May 26 (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters rallied outside McDonald’s Corp headquarters as shareholders on Thursday approved executive compensation and voted down a slate of shareholder resolutions, including those involving political contributions and antibiotic use in meat production. The picketers are part of a national “Fight for $15” movement that, along with an improving job market, has spurred pay raises at major employers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc  and McDonald’s, though not to the level demanded by protesting workers and supporters. McDonald’s, the world’s biggest fast-food chain, last summer  increased average worker pay to almost $10 per hour. But those raises were limited to just a fraction of all McDonald’s restaurant workers in the United States because franchisees operate almost 90 percent of the chain’s 14,000 domestic locations. Protesters called on Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook, the architect of a turnaround plan that is gaining traction with help from a sales boost from all-day breakfast, to share the higher profits with all McDonald’s workers rather than just executives and shareholders. Workers seeking pay of at least $15 per hour and the right to unionize, and their supporters, have protested at the company’s annual meeting for years. Their actions this week prompted McDonald’s to temporarily close its Oak Brook, Illinois, headquarters for the third year in a row. “This comes down to holding McDonald’s accountable for keeping workers in poverty,” said Naquasia LeGrand, 24, who traveled 15 hours on a chartered bus from North Carolina, where she makes $8.15 an hour as a McDonald’s swing manager. Angel Mitchell, a McDonald’s worker from Chicago, spent a rain-soaked night camping out at the company’s headquarters. “We cook and serve those all-day breakfasts that are making McDonald’s millions and millions, but we can’t feed our own families without turning to food stamps,” Mitchell said. McDonald’s says it cannot tell its franchisees how to pay their employees. The issue is the subject of a closely watched case before the National Labor Relations Board. “At McDonald’s, we take seriously our role in helping strengthen communities,” providing many with their very first job, spokeswoman Lisa McComb said by email on Wednesday as protests kicked off. The “Fight for $15” campaign is backed by the Service Employees International Union and also includes people who work in home care, child care, airports and higher education.

1006,MCD,Hundreds protest in downpour at shut McDonald's headquarters,"OAK BROOK, Ill. (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters marched through pouring rain to call for higher wages and union rights at McDonald’s Corp on Wednesday, leading the hamburger chain to shut down its headquarters a day before its annual meeting. The suburban Chicago campus was shut for the third year in a row because of protests centered on the shareholder gathering, which will be on Thursday. The marchers are part of a larger U.S. movement for higher pay that, along with an improved economy, has spurred pay rises at companies ranging from Wal-Mart Stores to McDonald’s own company-owned restaurants. McDonald’s restaurant employees and supporters seeking a $15-an-hour minimum wage and better benefits marched about two blocks in the downpour to the headquarters. “If we don’t get it, shut it down,” they chanted. A Reuters witness estimated that there were up to a thousand protesters, though an accurate count was difficult because of the weather. After the march, many scattered while others set up dozens of small tents on the street in front of the McDonald’s building. Police watched from company property and there was no sign of violence.  McDonald’s encouraged employees to work from home on Wednesday and Thursday, spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in an email. The “Fight for $15” campaign, which is backed by the  Service Employees International Union, since 2012 has had a hand in convincing some lawmakers and big employers to boost minimum wages and improve working conditions. The union represents workers ranging from fast-food restaurants to home health aides.  Last July, McDonald’s raised average hourly pay and began offering paid vacations and other benefits for the roughly 90,000 workers at its company-operated U.S. restaurants.  “At McDonald’s, we take seriously our role in helping strengthen communities,” providing many with their very first job,” McComb said. As one of the world’s largest and most recognizable companies, McDonald’s is the target of frequent protests. It says it cannot tell its franchisees how to pay their employees. Almost 90 percent of McDonald’s 14,000 U.S. restaurants are operated by franchisees. McDonald’s worker Adriana Alvarez, 24, of Chicago, said employees had been given three raises in one year at her franchisee-owned restaurant, a change for the good. She makes $10.50 an hour and came out to protest for the third year in a row, fueled by her desire to give her 4-year-old son, Manny, a better future.  “The fact that you have to choose paying your light bill or eating is ridiculous,” she said standing on a flat bed truck and soaked from the rain.  McDonald’s recently revived its business with a turnaround plan that included selling breakfast all day in the United States.  While executives and shareholders have reaped rewards via salary hikes and gains in the stock price, front-line workers say they have not shared in the wealth. “Corporations ought to invest in workers so they don’t need food stamps, subsidized housing and other benefits,” SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said.

1016,MCD,U.S. union takes aim at potential McDonald's deals in Asia,"LOS ANGELES, June 20 (Reuters) - The union backing a high-profile campaign to raise pay and improve working conditions for low-wage U.S. workers on Monday warned potential buyers of roughly 3,000 McDonald’s Corp restaurants in Asia that such deals could saddle them with operational risks, including significant costs and liabilities. While it is not uncommon for U.S. unions to weigh in on corporate mergers or other agreements that could affect the workers they represent, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) is acting on behalf of fast-food workers who are not unionized. McDonald’s, the world’s biggest restaurant chain by revenue, is seeking local partners to expand its Asia business. It aims to sell restaurants in China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan, as well as a portion of its stake in McDonald’s Japan. “We believe McDonald’s past practices pose risks for its future licensees, those firms’ investors, McDonald’s franchisees in Asia, and the workers employed at McDonald’s stores,” SEIU Executive Vice President Scott Courtney said in a letter sent via email and regular mail to firms including KKR China, Baring Private Equity Asia and New Hope Group. McDonald’s and the firms targeted by SEIU did not immediately provide comment. The SEIU has spent tens of millions of dollars on a multiyear campaign, including frequent public marches and protests, to improve the plight of low-wage retail and fast-food workers. Last year the union pressed the Federal Trade Commission to investigate alleged abusive practices by major franchisors, including McDonald’s Corp and 7-Eleven Inc . Among other things, SEIU warned the royalties paid to McDonald’s by some international licensees have been set to rise over time. The royalties are based on a percentage of sales and insulate McDonald’s from the uncertainty of changing labor, food and other operating costs that are borne by franchisees. The union noted that Arcos Dorados Holdings Inc, McDonald’s largest global franchisee, has had a rocky run since its initial public offering in 2011. Arcos Dorados has struggled with currency woes and economic turbulence in the Latin American region where it operates. Its shares trade below $5, far below their IPO price of $17. McDonald’s business in China was hurt after a 2014 meat supplier scandal that also battered sales in other countries in the region.

1022,MCD,U.S. lawsuit: A McDonald's worker was fired for being HIV-positive,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said on Tuesday it has filed a lawsuit accusing the operators of a McDonald’s restaurant in Bentonville, Arkansas, of firing a worker because he was HIV-positive. In its complaint against Mathews Management Co and Peach Orchard Inc, the EEOC said the worker was fired in February 2015 after admitting to the restaurant’s general manager to having had “an interest” in a co-worker, and telling that co-worker about his HIV-positive status.

The ruling by the Luxembourg-based General Court came after Singapore firm Future Enterprises challenged the European Union Intellectual Property Office’s rejection of its application to register ‘MACCOFFEE’ as an EU trade mark for foodstuffs and beverages. The U.S. fastfood chain said the Singapore company’s claim should be blocked as the patent office had previously granted it exclusivity to the McDONALD’s name and 12 other trademarks which included the elements ‘Mc’ or ‘Mac’ as prefixes. The General Court backed the patent office’s decision. “The repute of McDonald’s trade marks makes it possible to prevent the registration, for foods or beverages, of trade marks combining the prefix ‘Mac’ or ‘Mc’ with the name of a foodstuff or beverage,” judges said. “Indeed, it is highly probable that MACCOFFEE rides on the coat tails of McDonald’s in order to benefit from its power of attraction, its reputation and its prestige, and exploits, without paying any financial compensation, the marketing effort made by McDonald’s in order to create and maintain its image,” they said. The verdict can be appealed at the EU Court of Justice, Europe’s highest. The case is T-518/13 Future Enterprises v EUIPO.

1029,MCD,"McDonald's, U.S. restaurants losing food fight with grocers","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) said the U.S. restaurant industry will raise prices far more than supermarkets this year, sending a chill through a sector that is searching for ways to protect itself from higher worker wages.  The forecast and weak quarterly sales at domestic McDonald’s restaurants sent shares in the world’s biggest restaurant company down 4.5 percent to $121.71 and pulled down most of the restaurant sector. The Dow Jones U.S. Restaurants & Bars Index .DJUSRU was off 2.2 percent. The world’s biggest fast-food chain gets roughly one-third of its revenue and 40 percent of profits from the United States. The food service industry is harder hit by state and local minimum wage increases because it employs more minimum wage workers than any other occupation. Some planned minimum wage hikes will more than double the prevailing wage to $15 per hour over time.     The second-quarter report from McDonald’s landed after chains such as Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O), Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) also reported disappointing results for the latest quarter in large part due to weak customer traffic.  Restaurant food inflation is outpacing the increases at supermarkets and the gap is widening, McDonald’s Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said on a conference call with analysts. Food-at-home inflation is expected to be flat to up about 1 percent for this year, while food-away-from-home inflation is expected to be up 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent, he said. Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said restaurant companies, which are grappling with profit-squeezing minimum wage increases, use more labor than grocery stores and have the extra burden of trying to convince franchisees to hold back on price increases aimed at offsetting higher labor costs.      “Food prices are coming down, but labor is not. That’s doubly bad for restaurants,” Senatore said. “It’s hard to convince everybody to operate in lock step.” When franchisees raise prices, she said, “it just makes their prices look even higher relative to grocery stores.” Restaurant executives also pinned part of the blame for the second-quarter softness on the fractious U.S. presidential election and uncertainty spawned by terrorist attacks around the world.  “I think generally there’s just a broader level of uncertainty in consumers minds at the moment,” Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said on the company’s earnings call.  While such events loom as a risk to U.S. consumer spending, that threat was not enough to dissuade the National Retail Federation from boosting its retail sales growth forecast for the remainder of the year from 3.1 percent to 3.4 percent. The forecast excludes spending at restaurants. “There are many factors that could prove to be hurdles but our overall outlook is optimistic,” NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a statement on Tuesday.      McDonald’s sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months were up 1.8 percent in the quarter, far less than the 3.2 percent rise that analysts expected, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. McDonald’s executives said they expected labor cost pressures to continue, but declined to elaborate. They did, however, note that the company generally needs same-restaurant sales to increase 2 percent to 3 percent to maintain profits. McDonald’s total revenue declined 3.5 percent to $6.27 billion, in line with the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income in the quarter fell 9.1 percent to $1.09 billion, or $1.25 per share, in the quarter. The company recorded pretax charges of about $230 million, or 20 cents per share, in the latest quarter related to its program to sell company-owned stores to franchisees and relocation of its headquarters to Chicago.

1033,MCD,US STOCKS-Weak earnings weigh on Wall Street; Fed awaited,"* FOMC begins two-day meeting on Tuesday * Apple set to report results after market close * McDonald’s, Verizon fall on weak results * Indexes down: Dow 0.42 pct, S&P; 0.24 pct, Nasdaq 0.1 pct   (Adds details, comments, updates prices) By Yashaswini Swamynathan July 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday after weak results from a number of companies, including McDonald’s and Gilead, dented investor sentiment. Investors are awaiting Apple’s earnings later in the day and the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting on interest rates that ends on Wednesday. The central bank is not expected to pull the trigger on interest rates in the near term as inflation remains below its 2 percent target and global growth continues to sputter. Traders have priced in an 18.7 percent chance of a rate increase in September and a 42.8 percent chance in December, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. “Investors have had the opportunity to drink from a fire hydrant of information,” said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at the Private Client Reserve at U.S. Bank. “But the appetite is likely to increase when markets close today and after the Fed’s comments on interest rates tomorrow.” Strong economic data and a string of strong quarterly results so far have spurred Wall Street’s record-setting rally in the past two weeks. Of the 129 S&P; 500 companies that reported earnings until Monday, about 68 percent topped analysts’ estimates. In a typical quarter, 63 percent of companies beat expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. At 11:24 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 77.63 points, or 0.42 percent, at 18,415.43. The S&P; 500 was down 5.28 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,163.2. The Nasdaq Composite index was down 4.85 points, or 0.1 percent, at 5,092.78. Seven of the 10 major S&P; sectors were lower, led by a 1.25 percent drop in the telecom services index. Verzion  shares fell 2 percent after the company reported a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly revenue. McDonald’s dropped 4.4 percent to $121.76, after the restaurant chain’s comparable sales missed analysts’ expectations. The stock weighed the most on the Dow. Gilead fell 8 percent after the drugmaker cut its full-year sales forecast, attracting a host of price target cuts. The stock was the top loser on the S&P; and the Nasdaq. One bright spot was Texas Instruments, which rose 6 percent after its current-quarter forecast beat analysts’ estimates. The stock provided the biggest boost to the S&P.; Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,552 to 1,278. On the Nasdaq, 1,417 issues rose and 1,251 fell.

1040,MCD,"UPDATE 2-McDonald's to remove corn syrup from buns, curbs antibiotics in chicken","OAK BROOK, Ill. (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) will replace corn syrup in hamburger buns with sugar this month and has removed antibiotics that are important to human medicine from its chicken months ahead of schedule, it said on Monday, moves that are part of its drive to target increasingly health-conscious consumers.     The fast food company also said it eliminated artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets and several breakfast items, including scrambled eggs. McDonald’s is reacting to a shift in consumer tastes toward healthier, more natural foods and competing with other restaurants that are overhauling their menus to feature items free of processed ingredients. McDonald’s USA President Mike Andres told reporters at the company’s headquarters that the changes announced on Monday will affect about half its menu and more adjustments would follow.  Some consumers have turned away from products containing high-fructose corn syrup, which is derived from corn starch, because of concerns it may be linked to obesity.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it is unaware of any differences in the safety of foods containing equal amounts of corn syrup and sugar, or sucrose.  McDonald’s is “following the customers” in switching to sucrose in buns used on Big Macs, Quarter Pounders, hamburgers and other sandwiches, said Marion Gross, senior vice president of McDonald’s North America supply chain. “We know that they don’t feel good about high-fructose corn syrup so we’re giving them what they’re looking for instead,” she said. McDonald’s stopped adding an artificial preservative to the cooking oil used to make Chicken McNuggets and removed artificial preservatives from pork sausage patties, eggs served on McGriddles breakfast sandwiches and scrambled eggs on breakfast platters. It also removed chicken skin, safflower oil and citric acid from the meat of its McNuggets, swapping them for pea starch, rice starch and powdered lemon juice.   Extra costs related to the changes will not be passed on to consumers, partly because a decline in commodity prices has reduced some food expenses, Andres said. Last week, McDonald’s said the U.S. restaurant industry will raise prices far more than supermarkets this year, sending a chill through a sector that is searching for ways to protect itself from higher worker wages. McDonald’s had previously planned to stop buying chicken raised with antibiotics important to human medicine from its suppliers, Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) and Keystone Foods, by March 2017.  It completed the change earlier due to quicker than expected work by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which helped to verify that birds were not given the drugs, Gross said. Some health experts have raised concerns that the overuse of antibiotics for poultry may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans.  McDonald’s shares rose 0.3 percent to $118.01.

1042,MCD,Exclusive : Wendy's to ban chickens with human antibiotics by 2017,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Wendy’s Co, the fifth-largest U.S. fast-food chain by revenue, will quit using chickens raised with antibiotics important to human health by 2017, the company told Reuters on Thursday. Fast-food industry leader McDonald’s Corp on Monday said it had completed its shift to using only using chickens raised without antibiotics important to human medicine, months ahead of its estimated March 2017 target.  Concern has been growing among public health experts, consumers and shareholders that the overuse of such drugs is contributing to rising numbers of life-threatening human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria dubbed “superbugs.” An estimated 70 percent of antibiotics important to human health are sold for use in meat and dairy production. Veterinary use of antibiotics is legal. However, as the number of human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria increases, consumer advocates and public health experts have become more critical of the practice of routinely feeding antibiotics to chickens, cattle and pigs. Wendy’s and its chicken suppliers have been working to eliminate all antibiotics important to human medicine from chicken production, the company told Reuters on Thursday. As of June 2016, half of Wendy’s chicken supply was raised without medically important antibiotics. Wendy’s said it would be at 100 percent by next year.  Wendy’s, which purchases more than 250 million pounds of chicken annually, also said it would commit to specific goals for the reduction of antibiotics important to humans in pork and beef production in 2017.  With regard to beef, Wendy’s said it is engaged with academics and industry experts on work that includes trials for probiotics, vaccines, feed supplements and nutrition composition.  The company posted the new policies to its website on July 28 but did not otherwise publicize the change, before speaking with Reuters.

A week after the world’s biggest fast-food company took that step with poultry at its U.S. restaurants, U.K.-based ShareAction launched an online campaign enabling people to email McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) CEO Steve Easterbrook. The group, which promotes socially responsible investing, wants Easterbrook to prohibit the use of antibiotics important to human medicine in McDonald’s global chicken, beef, pork and dairy supply chains, for purposes other than disease treatment or non-routine control of veterinarian-diagnosed illness.  “We hope this action will encourage McDonald’s to supersize their ambition,” ShareAction Chief Executive Catherine Howarth said.  Scientists have warned that regular use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of antibiotic-resistant “superbug” infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health. McDonald’s referred Reuters to an earlier statement that said it was premature to set a timeline for curbing antibiotic use in meats other than chicken, due to varying agricultural practices and regulations around the world.  “We continue to regularly review this issue,” that statement said. Rival Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) told Reuters last week that by next year, it would stop using chickens raised with antibiotics important to human health. It also said it would set specific goals for pork and beef production in 2017. Meanwhile, Yum Brands Inc’s (YUM.N) KFC fried-chicken chain is under fire for a policy that critics say effectively allows for routine use of antibiotics by its chicken suppliers.  More than 70 percent of all antibiotics used in the United States and half of those used in the United Kingdom are given to livestock, ShareAction said.       In April, an investor coalition with about $1 trillion under management, led by ShareAction and the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative, pressed McDonald’s and nine other large food companies to set timelines for stopping the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics important to human health in their supply chains.

1046,MCD,"U.S. slams EU, but Apple tax demand first issued in Washington","* Washington warns $14.5 billion Irish bill may hurt relations * U.S. probe first alerted EU to tax schemes by Apple and others * Senator who chaired hearings blames IRS, says EU ‘fills vacuum’ By Foo Yun Chee and Alastair Macdonald BRUSSELS, Aug 30 - The United States is furious at the European Union for handing Apple Inc a $14.5 billion tax demand on Tuesday but EU officials say it was Washington which put them on to the scheme in the first place. It was a U.S. Senate report in May 2013 revealing the tech giant’s deal with the Irish government to rule a big slice of its global earnings untaxable that prompted the European Commission to launch its own inquiries the following month. The U.S. Treasury said the Commission’s order that Apple pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland - which the company and Dublin are appealing - endangers EU-U.S. economic relations just as efforts to reach a transatlantic free trade pact unravel . A senior Democratic senator said Brussels had made “a cheap money grab” for U.S. revenues. But his party colleague who chaired hearings into Apple’s taxes three years ago, Carl Levin, said the Europeans were only trying to take what U.S. authorities had failed to claim by not closing loopholes that allowed firms to hoard profits overseas. “The IRS has failed to stake a claim for U.S. taxes on those revenues,” he said in a statement, referring to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. “So Europe attempts to fill the vacuum. Shame on Apple for dodging U.S. taxes. Shame on the IRS for failing to challenge Apple’s tax avoidance.” For Marcel Fratzscher, president of leading German economic think-tank DIW Berlin and author of a new book on growing inequality, the mudslinging between politicians reflects how global corporations have exploited competition for investment to blunt states’ efforts to co-operate against tax avoidance. “Companies are playing one government against another,” he told Reuters. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, a straight-talking Dane who dismisses talk of leading an anti-American crusade, says the hearings at the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations chaired by Levin were what gave her Spanish  predecessor grounds to demand disclosure by Apple and Ireland. “The Commission listened and decided to look deeper into the matter,” Vestager said in June, crediting media reporting and hearings in the British parliament for also providing evidence to help break secrecy around nearly 1,000 cases across Europe. The Commission said in its judgment on Apple that the United States and other countries were welcome to try and claim some of the unpaid taxes for themselves - highlighting just the complaints of Levin and other senators three years ago when they skewered Apple CEO Tim Cook for failing to bring cash home. As well as Apple, Starbucks Corp was ordered to pay more Dutch taxes and Amazon.com Inc and McDonald’s Corp  are still being investigated; a series of EU accusations that Google, part of Alphabet Inc, has abused its market power have also fuelled complaints from U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration that Europe is out to punish American success. Competition lawyer Pierre Sabbadini said political pressures drove different responses by different authorities. Leaks and public hearings on tax deals had created pressure among voters for the EU to act in 2013, he said, while the size of the companies targeted gave them clout with political leaders, too. “When investigation-target companies have grown to the size of Apple, they can reach out for political support,” he said. The Obama administration has taken its own action to curb tax avoidance schemes lately. In April, amid public controversy over drug company Pfizer Inc’s proposed merger with Allergan Plc of Ireland, it announced plans to curb so-called “tax inversions”, by which U.S. firms have undertaken cross-border mergers in order to switch to a domicile abroad and so avoid U.S. taxes. Pfizer abandoned the merger.

1052,MCD,EU hits Apple with $14.5 billion Irish tax demand,"BRUSSELS/DUBLIN (Reuters) - The European Commission ordered Apple Inc to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) on Tuesday as it ruled the firm had received illegal state aid. Apple and Dublin said the U.S. company’s tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law and they would appeal the ruling, which is part of a drive against what the EU says are sweetheart tax deals that usually smaller states in the bloc offer multinational companies to lure jobs and investment. The U.S. feels its firms are being targeted by the EU and a U.S. Treasury spokesperson warned the move threatens to undermine U.S. investment in Europe and “the important spirit of economic partnership between the U.S. and the EU.”     Starbucks Corp has been ordered to pay up to 30 million euros ($33 million) to the Dutch state, while Amazon.com Inc and McDonald’s Corp are also under investigation by the Commission, the EU’s executive arm.  Apple’s stock fell less than 1 percent. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager questioned how anyone might think an arrangement that allowed Apple to pay a tax rate of 0.005 percent, as Apple’s main Irish unit did in 2014, was fair. “Tax rulings granted by Ireland have artificially reduced Apple’s tax burden for over two decades, in breach of the EU state aid rules. Apple now has to repay the benefits,” Vestager told a news conference.   Analysts said the size of the claim underlined the Commission’s aggressive stance, but since each case involves different circumstances and tax rules, lawyers said it was hard to see if further big claims were any more or less likely. Apple, which had more than $200 billion in cash and readily marketable securities at the end of June, is likely to see the case drag out for years in EU and possibly Irish courts.  Apple warned investors in a July regulatory filing that the Commission’s investigation could lead to “material” liability for further tax payments, but that it could not estimate the impact. On Tuesday the company said it expects to place “some amount of cash” in an escrow account. Tax experts say the European Commission faces a tough battle to convince courts to back up its stand. While the EU has found that certain tax regulations are anti-competitive, it has never before ruled whether countries have applied tax regulations fairly in the way it has with Apple, Starbucks and others.  As a result, some lawyers and accountants said they doubted Apple would end up paying back any tax. “I am not persuaded by the reasoning the EU has applied,” said Tim Wach, global managing director at international tax advisers Taxand. “ARTIFICIAL” ARRANGEMENT    The EU’s ruling challenges the way that Ireland agreed to tax the profits of Irish-registered Apple subsidiaries, through which most of its non-U.S. profits flowed. Apple Inc licenses the rights to technology designed in the United States to Irish subsidiaries. These then hire contract manufacturers to make devices which they sell to Apple retail subsidiaries around Europe and Asia.  Since the manufacturing cost is a small portion of device sales prices and retail subsidiaries are allocated a small operating margin, Apple Ireland is very profitable. In 2011, it earned $22 billion after paying $2 billion to its U.S. parent in relation to the rights to Apple intellectual property. However, the Irish tax authority agreed only 50 million euros of this was taxable in Ireland, the European Commission said. Under the terms of Apple’s tax deal, first agreed in 1991 and renewed in 2007, Apple could allocate most of the profits earned by its Irish operating units to a “head office” that did not have any employees or own any premises. “This ‘head office’ had no operating capacity to handle and manage the distribution business, or any other substantive business for that matter,” the Commission said. The Commission said this agreement had no basis in tax law and was not available to others, and so represented state aid. Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said he profoundly disagreed with the decision and in order to preserve Ireland’s attractiveness for investment he would appeal. “There is no economic basis for this decision. It’s bizarre and it’s an exercise in politics by the Competition Commission,” Noonan said. “They don’t have responsibility for taxes and they are opening a back door through state aid to influence tax policy in European countries when the European treaties say tax policy is a matter for sovereign governments,” he added. Ireland’s low corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of the country’s economic policy for decades, drawing investors from multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 of the country’s workers. For many technology firms like Google and Facebook, a key attraction is that Ireland allows companies to adopt tax structures which see them pay much less than the 12.5 percent headline rate. The companies say they follow all tax rules. Apple said it was confident of winning an appeal. “The European Commission has launched an effort to rewrite Apple’s history in Europe, ignore Ireland’s tax laws and upend the international tax system in the process,” CEO Tim Cook said in a letter to customers posted on Apple’s website. “A company’s profits should be taxed in the country where the value is created,” he added. U.S. OPPOSITION    The U.S. Treasury Department published a white paper last week in which it said it was looking at possible responses to what it sees as unfair targeting of its firms, which could include extra taxes on the U.S. arms of European companies. The paper noted that the EU executive’s tax rulings could cost the U.S. exchequer money.  Under U.S. tax law, Apple’s Irish profits are taxable if brought back to the United States – something the company would have to do if it wanted to use the money to pay dividends. But any tax paid in Europe is reduced from the tax due in the United States. The Treasury has said the Commission’s approach was at odds with EU tax law and international treaties. The Commission, which has also ruled European companies including carmaker Fiat and Swedish engineer Atlas Copco AB must pay tax claims worth over $350 million, said its application of competition law to tax rulings followed EU law and treated all companies equally. Nonetheless, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg have already appealed EU rulings against their tax deals with multinationals.  Apple employs 5,500 people in areas such as logistics and distribution in the Irish city of Cork, which has about a quarter of Apple’s Europe-based staff.  The Commission has previously said Apple’s tax treatment had been “motivated by employment considerations.”  Apple has said it paid Ireland’s 12.5 percent rate on all the income that it generates in the country.

1054,MCD,"Carlyle, TPG form separate teams to bid for McDonald's North Asia stores: sources","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Private equity firms Carlyle Group (CG.O) and TPG Capital have teamed up with two separate Chinese state companies to bid for McDonald’s (MCD.N) outlets in China and Hong Kong in a deal worth between $2 billion and $3 billion, four people familiar with the matter said. The sources said the global buyout firms are pairing up with strategic bidders that more closely fit the profile McDonald’s has said it is looking for; long-term partners, rather than private equity firms, which typically cash out after a few years. Carlyle is working with Chinese state conglomerate CITIC Group, and TPG has joined hands with Beijing Capital Agribusiness Group, to place binding bids ahead of the mid-September deadline, the people added. Beijing Capital Agribusiness is McDonald’s current China partner. Carlyle and TPG would have a large minority stake in their respective consortium, one of the people said. Reuters previously reported that the Illinois-based fast-food giant, which has been hit by a series of food-supply scandals in China, had hired Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to run the sale of about 2,800 restaurants in China, Hong Kong and South Korea. The two private equity-backed groups are only bidding for China and Hong Kong outlets and will be pitted against China Cinda Asset Management Co (1359.HK), Beijing Tourism Group and private Chinese technology and real estate firm Sanpower Group, one of the people added.

1055,MCD,"UPDATE 2-Carlyle, TPG form separate teams to bid for McDonald's N.Asia stores -sources","HONG KONG (Reuters) - Private equity firms Carlyle Group (CG.O) and TPG Capital have teamed up with two separate Chinese state companies to bid for McDonald’s (MCD.N) outlets in China and Hong Kong in a deal worth between $2 billion and $3 billion, four people familiar with the matter said. The sources said the global buyout firms are pairing up with strategic bidders that more closely fit the profile McDonald’s has said it is looking for; long-term partners, rather than private equity firms, which typically cash out after a few years. Carlyle is working with Chinese state conglomerate CITIC Group, and TPG has joined hands with Beijing Capital Agribusiness Group, to place binding bids ahead of the mid-September deadline, the people added. Beijing Capital Agribusiness is McDonald’s current China partner. Carlyle and TPG would have a large minority stake in their respective consortium, one of the people said. Reuters previously reported that the Illinois-based fast-food giant, which has been hit by a series of food-supply scandals in China, had hired Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to run the sale of about 2,800 restaurants in China, Hong Kong and South Korea. The two private equity-backed groups are only bidding for China and Hong Kong outlets and will be pitted against China Cinda Asset Management Co (1359.HK), Beijing Tourism Group and private Chinese technology and real estate firm Sanpower Group, one of the people added.

The Competition Commission, an anti-trust authority, said it approved the transaction for the Emirates-based company, MSA Holdings, to acquire the fast-food restaurants because it would not present undue competition to local companies. “Given that the acquiring group is not here at all in South Africa we found that, if approved, it is unlikely to substantially lessen or present competition,” said the commission’s spokesman Itumeleng Lesofe, without elaborating. In May 2014, Ramaphosa announced his complete disinvestment from Shanduka to avoid conflicts of interest with his government duties after President Jacob Zuma named him deputy president.

1066,MCD,"McDonald's, franchisees hit with sexual harassment complaints","(Reuters) - A union-backed group said it had filed complaints on behalf of 15 U.S. McDonald’s workers who say they were sexually harassed on the job, in the latest challenge to how the fast-food company and its franchisees treat employees. Fight for $15, which has organized strikes and protests calling for employers to raise wages, said on Wednesday that it filed the administrative complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against McDonald’s USA LLC and individual franchisees in eight states over the last month.   Cycei Monae, a McDonald’s worker in Flint, Michigan, said a manager showed her a picture of his genitals and said he wanted to “do things” to her, according to a complaint provided by Fight for $15. Corporate officials ignored her complaints, Monae said on a phone call with reporters on Wednesday. In another complaint, a worker in Folsom, California, said a supervisor offered her $1,000 for oral sex.  Thirteen of the complaints were by women, and two were by men, said Fight for $15, which the Service Employees International Union formed in 2012. “As the country’s second-largest employer, McDonald’s has a responsibility to set standards in both the fast-food industry and the economy overall,” Kendall Fells, organizing director for Fight for $15, said in a statement.  McDonald’s spokeswoman Terri Hickey said the company takes harassment complaints seriously and was reviewing the allegations. “At McDonald’s, we and our independent owner-operators share a deep commitment to the respectful treatment of everyone,” she said in a statement. The EEOC, a federal agency that enforces discrimination laws, does not comment on complaints it receives, it said. It can file lawsuits on workers’ behalf or grant them permission to bring their own cases.  While most of the complaints were filed on behalf of employees at franchised restaurants that McDonald’s Corp does not own, all of them say the company is responsible for the harassment because it controls working conditions there.  McDonald’s is also facing a class-action lawsuit in federal court in San Francisco by 800 workers at several franchised restaurants who say they are owed overtime pay and were forced to skip breaks.   The company has denied that it is a “joint employer,” a designation that could render it liable for labor law violations by franchisees and require it to bargain with workers at those restaurants if they unionize.  In a case before the National Labor Relations Board, Fight for $15 claims the company is a joint employer of franchise workers who say they faced retaliation for joining in nationwide strikes organized by the group. McDonald’s has said it neither retaliated against workers at its own restaurants nor instructed franchisees to do so.",10052016,http://www.reuters.com/article/mcdonalds-complaint/mcdonalds-franchisees-hit-with-sexual-harassment-complaints-idUSL2N1CB179

Reza Food Services Co. Ltd, which owns and operates McDonald’s restaurants in the western and southern region of Saudi Arabia, has tapped Malaysian bank CIMB (CIMB.KL) to finance the transaction, said two of the sources, who declined to be identified as the deal has not been publicly announced. The move is in line with McDonald’s plans to bring in partners as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model in Asia. One person familiar with the Southeast Asian deal said McDonald’s was keen to tie up with regional family-owned groups and local tycoons as it sought out long-term partners rather than buyout firms, which usually cash out of a business after a few years. Basic terms of the agreement had been finalised and the deal was expected to be completed by the year-end, the person said. CIMB declined to comment, while there was no immediate response from McDonald’s. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Reza for a comment. Sources said CIMB would provide the bulk of the term loan to back the deal, and the financing would be denominated in both Malaysian ringgit and Singapore dollars. In July, McDonald’s had said it was seeking franchise partners for its restaurants in Singapore and Malaysia and was negotiating with parties, but did not provide any details or a timeline. McDonald’s has about 120 restaurants in Singapore and about 260 in Malaysia.

Target (TGT.N) decided last week to winnow down its assortment of clown masks and costumes available for sale in U.S. stores and online “given the current environment,” company spokesman Joshua Thomas said on Monday. Although Target received some isolated consumer comments about scary clown accessories, the decision to pull some masks from inventories stemmed from “a conversation internally about how we can respond to the situation at hand,” Thomas told Reuters. The clown-mask culling, limited to one in-store product item and about 10 different selections online, affected a “very tiny” portion of Target’s overall Halloween merchandise, Thomas added. Target declined to specify exactly which products were pulled but said those kept in stock reflected a more traditional, less threatening image of happy, cheerful clowns. Similarly, McDonald’s (MCD.N) and its franchise owners have cut back in the number of public appearances being made by performers dressed up as the chain’s trademark hamburger-happy clown Ronald McDonald during the past two weeks, according to the company. The fast-food chain, in a statement, cited “the current climate around clown sightings in communities” for its decision. Reports of menacing individuals dressed as clowns or wearing clown masks began surfacing in late August around Greenville, South Carolina, and have since spread to several other states, perplexing police and unnerving parents across the country. Clowns have been reported spotted lurking near wooded areas or on dark roads, and even driving in cars, some brandishing knives or waving wads of money at children.

1071,MCD,McDonald's U.S. sales revive amid stiff competition,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s (MCD.N) turnaround remained on track in the latest quarter despite intense competition in the United States, helped by all-day breakfast, “McPick” value promotions and chicken McNuggets with simpler ingredients, the company said on Friday.  Sales at established U.S. restaurants rose 1.3 percent, amid industry softness that executives partly blamed on lower grocery prices that encouraged some diners to cook at home.  The result from the United States, which accounts for about 40 percent of overall profit at McDonald’s, just exceeded analysts’ lowered expectations, and was not as robust as the 2 percent U.S. same-store sales gain reported by rival Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) on Thursday.  McDonald’s international restaurants easily beat expectations on same-store sales growth in Britain, Australia, Canada and Germany.  As a result, global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 3.5 percent for the third quarter, handily beating the 1.5 percent average gain expected by analysts. McDonald’s Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook has vowed to transform the 60-year-old chain into a “modern, progressive burger company.” He has introduced the all-day breakfast, banned the use of medically important antibiotics in U.S. chicken, and has been working to speed up service and make it friendlier. Shares of McDonald’s closed up 3 percent to $113.93, despite analyst warnings that fourth-quarter U.S. same-store sales could drop 2 percent due to the high bar set by the debut of the all-day breakfast in October 2015. RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer pressed executives on the conference call about what they will do next, given the “common perception” that all-day breakfast and McPick “are running out of gas as sales drivers” in the United States.    Easterbrook said international restaurants’ “experience of the future” efforts, including digital kiosks and mobile apps, could bolster domestic operations.     The world’s largest fast-food chain’s net income increased 2.6 percent to $1.28 billion, or $1.50 per share, helped by lower food costs, cost cuts such as workforce reductions and better-than-expected global restaurant sales. McDonald’s had 9.3 percent fewer shares outstanding versus the year earlier, which lifted earnings per share results. Excluding items, the company earned $1.62 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.48, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue fell almost 3 percent to $6.42 billion. That was down for a ninth straight quarter, largely due to the sale of restaurants to franchisees. Nevertheless, the result still exceeded the average analyst estimate of $6.28 billion.

1077,MCD,CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Slowing sales at Burger King push parent's shares down,"(Reuters) - Restaurant Brands International Inc, owner of Burger King and Tim Hortons, reported a second straight quarter of decline in comparable sales at Burger King in the United States and Canada. The company’s U.S.-listed shares, which had risen about 26 percent this year up to Friday’s close, fell as much as 3 percent despite a better-than-expected third-quarter profit. Total comparable sales at Burger King rose 1.7 percent in the quarter ended Sept. 30, far less than the 6.2 percent rise a year earlier. Comparable sales in the United States and Canada fell 0.5 percent. McDonald’s Corp raised expectations across the fast-food industry last week after posting a better-than-expected 1.3 percent rise in U.S. restaurants. “In light of McDonald’s more robust numbers, it is disappointing that Burger King did not push into positive territory,” Neil Saunders, CEO of retail research firm Conlumino, wrote in a note. U.S. burger chains, including McDonald’s, Burger King and Wendy’s Co, are battling intense competition from upstart chains and meal-kit sellers. The sector is also under pressure from a drop in grocery prices, a trend that is encouraging more people to eat at home. Burger King introduced new menu items such as Whopperrito, a burger-burrito mash-up, and Cheetos Chicken Fries, but the launches failed to attract more customers. “Burger King has more work to do to increase its appeal – including focusing on core lines and the overall restaurant experience,” Saunders wrote. Total comparable sales at Tim Hortons, which operates mainly in Canada, rose 2 percent in the third quarter, compared with a growth of 5.3 percent last year, when new lunchtime offers boosted growth. Restaurant Brands’ net profit attributable to shareholders rose to $86.3 million, or 36 cents per share, from $49.6 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier. Total costs and expenses fell 3 percent to $655.2 million. Excluding items, the company earned 43 cents per share, beating the analysts’ average estimate of 40 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said the quarter’s performance was “sufficient.” “QSR remains one of the few restaurants where investors can easily draw a multi-year path to margin improvement and earnings upside.” Oakville, Ontario-based Restaurant Brands’ revenue rose 5.5 percent to $1.08 billion, beating analysts’ estimate of $1.06 billion. The company raised its quarterly dividend to 17 cents per share from 16 cents. U.S.-listed shares of Restaurant Brands were down 2.1 percent at $46.01 in early trading.

1080,MCD,McDonald's to pay $3.75 mln in 1st settlement with franchise workers,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp has agreed to pay $3.75 million to settle a lawsuit claiming it was liable for labor law violations by a California franchisee, marking what lawyers said was the first time the company has settled legal claims by a group of U.S. workers at one of its franchises. In a filing in U.S. district court in San Francisco on Friday, lawyers representing about 800 employees at five restaurants owned by a single franchisee said Illinois-based McDonald’s would pay the workers $1.75 million in back pay and damages and $2 million in legal fees. The settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge, comes as McDonald’s faces claims before two U.S. agencies that it is a “joint employer” of workers at franchise restaurants, a designation that could make the company liable for legal violations by franchisees and require that it bargain with workers who unionize. McDonald’s spokeswoman Terri Hickey said on Monday the company is not a joint employer of franchise workers. “We entered into this mutually acceptable resolution to avoid the costs and disruption associated with continued litigation,” she said. The 2014 lawsuit claimed McDonald’s and the franchisee, Smith Family LP, violated California law by failing to pay overtime, keep accurate pay records and reimburse workers for time spent cleaning uniforms. The franchisee previously settled the claims for $700,000. Last year, a judge ruled that McDonald’s was not the plaintiffs’ joint employer under federal and state laws. But he said the company could still be held liable if the workers believed McDonald’s was their employer. In Friday’s court filing, lawyers for the workers said the settlement was the first for McDonald’s in a class action case brought by franchise employees. The deal would also require McDonald’s to train Smith Family, the franchisee, on the use of corporate software designed to ensure compliance with California’s uniquely strict employment laws, according to the court filing. McDonald’s, meanwhile, is in the midst of a trial at the National Labor Relations Board that could determine whether the company is a joint employer under the federal law governing union organizing. And earlier this month, a union-backed group said it had filed sexual harassment complaints against McDonald’s with a federal agency on behalf of 15 workers, most of whom were employed at franchise restaurants.

1083,MCD,Fitch Downgrades McDonald's IDR to 'BBB'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the Long-Term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE: MCD) to 'BBB' from 'BBB+'.  The Short-Term IDR has been affirmed at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  McDonald's has approximately $26 billion of total debt.  The downgrade reflects Fitch's expectation that total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will  be sustained in the mid-to-high 3.0x range through 2018, with EBITDA stabilizing  around the current level. LTM EBITDA at Sept. 30, 2016 was $9.4 billion. Given  McDonald's aggressive financial strategy, debt reduction is not anticipated.  Furthermore, while U.S. comps have improved since the fall of 2015, due in part  to better store-level execution and the launch of All-Day Breakfast, Fitch does  not view recent performance as sustainable. According to Bloomberg data provided  by Euromonitor International, McDonald's has gradually lost share to improving  quick-service competitors and fast-casual operators in the U.S. limited service  restaurant industry since 2012. Fitch believes McDonald's will continue to lose  share over the medium term, although quarterly volatility in share trends is  anticipated, due to heightened competition and changing consumer preferences.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Leverage Expected to Remain Elevated  McDonald's debt balance increased to $26 billion at Sept. 30, 2016 from roughly  $15 billion at the end of 2014 due to the company's three-year $30 billion  shareholder cash return plan which is expected to be completed by the end of  2016. For the LTM period ended Sept. 30, 2016, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR was  approximately 3.6x. Fitch projects leverage in the mid-to-high 3.0x range with  EBITDA stabilizing around $9.4 billion through 2018. Free cash flow (FCF;  defined as cash flow from operations less capex less dividends) is projected to  approximate $1 billion annually through 2018 and is expected to be deployed  towards share repurchases.  U.S. Trends Soften, Share Losses Expected to Continue The U.S. represented 39% of McDonald's 36,525 restaurants, 34% of its $25.4  billion of revenue and 51% of its $7.1 billion of operating income in 2015.  Fitch is concerned about McDonald's share trends in the U.S. given softening  performance and the recent narrowing of the company's comp gap versus the  broader U.S. quick-service restaurant sandwich category. For the quarter ended  Sept. 30, 2016, U.S. comps rose 1.3% as 3.5% pricing offset negative guest  counts. Per McDonald's, its comp gap to the category narrowed to 0.6% last  quarter from 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Fitch anticipates the positive  September quarter comp gap was due to pricing, which according to McDonald's  exceeded the industry by about 1%. Fitch attributes McDonald's softening U.S. comps to higher pricing that led to  declines in guest counts, a recent slowdown in the broader industry, heightened  competition, and growing consumer preference for freshly prepared food at a good  value. McDonald's typically increases prices in line with food-away-from  inflation but the company's price increases have exceeded the industry over the  past three quarters. Given that value continues to drive traffic and the need  for operators to remain competitively priced, Fitch anticipates that McDonald's  will price more in line with the market in 2017. The USDA is forecasting  food-away-from-home inflation of 2% - 3% in 2017, versus 2.5% - 3.5% this year. McDonald's is responding to changing consumer preferences by emphasizing food  quality. The company is also emphasizing value with its McPick2 platform and  investing in the McDonald's Experience of the Future to enhance the customer  experience. However, Fitch believes McDonald's will continue to gradually lose  share over the medium term in the U.S. due to increased choices for consumers,  stemming from the growth of specialty burger shops like Shake Shack and Five  Guys, and some weakening in McDonald's brand perception within the hamburger  category and among younger and health-conscious consumers in recent years.  International Comp Trends Providing Offset Comp trends in McDonald's international markets have exceeded those in the U.S.  During the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2016, comps in the company's foundational,  international lead, and high-growth markets rose 10.1%, 3.3%, and 1.5%,  respectively. Strong performance in the U.K, Australia, and Canada, a recovery  in Japan and China following supplier food safety issues in 2014, and  locally-relevant value offerings contributed to this growth. Fitch projects  McDonald's global comps will decelerate to around 2% in 2017 and 2018, after  rising a projected 3.5% in 2016. International markets are expected to continue  to outperform the U.S. where Fitch expects less pricing and potentially weaker  guest count trends. Refranchising and Potential Asset Sale  McDonald's is on track with its goal of increasing its mix of franchised units  from 81% in 2014 to 93% by the end of 2018 and 95% longer-term. Since the start  of 2015, the company has refranchised nearly 1,000 of the 4,000 company-operated  units targeted. Moreover, McDonald's recently disclosed that it is actively  pursuing a transaction in China and is making progress in its search for  strategic partners in Malaysia and Singapore. McDonald's operated roughly 2,200  units in China and nearly 400 in Malaysia and Singapore combined in 2015.  McDonald's shift towards a higher mix of franchised units is consistent with  industry trends. In 2015, 35% or $8.9 billion of McDonald's $25.4 billion of  revenue was from franchising. The margin from franchising was 81.5% versus a  margin of 15.2% from operating restaurants. Fitch projects more than 50% of  McDonald's revenue will be from franchising by 2018, which will increase  stability of cash flow due to a steady stream of royalty and rental income.  McDonald's is also exploring the sale of a portion of its 50% ownership in  McDonald's Holdings Co. Ltd (McDonald's Japan) which operated 2,956 units at the  end of 2015 under an affiliate structure. Based on the entity's approximately  400 billion Japanese Yen ($3.8 billion) market capitalization, McDonald's stake  is worth nearly $2 billion. Fitch anticipates cash proceeds from this  transaction and refranchising could total over $4 billion and will be returned  to shareholders. G&A; Cost Reductions to Continue Through 2017 McDonald's is targeting $500 million of annualized G&A; cost reductions with the  vast majority being realized by the end of 2017. The goal represents nearly 20%  of McDonald's $2.6 billion expense base at the beginning of 2015. Savings will  be realized through refranchising, lower corporate overhead, and greater  efficiencies across global business services. The company expects to realize  $150 million of savings, excluding increased incentive compensation, by the end  of 2016. Fitch expects these savings along with increased franchise royalty and  rental-based income to offset operating income declines associated with  refranchising.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for McDonald's include:  --Revenue approximates $24.7 billion in 2016 and declines to below $20 billion  by 2018 due to refranchising; --Global SSS growth approximates 3.5% in 2016 and 2% in 2017 and 2018 due to 2%  - 3% pricing and flat to slightly negative guest counts; --Operating income grows 7% to $8 billion in 2016, is relatively flat through  2018 due to G&A; cost reductions and expense management; --Total debt is sustained around $26 billion through 2018;  --FCF approximates $1 billion annually in 2017 and 2018; --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR is in the mid-to-high 3x range  through 2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR sustained in the low-3x range;  --Global comps consistently above 2% along with the maintenance of market share  in the U.S. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR near 4x due to material declines in  operating income or increased debt;  --A year or more of negative global comps and greater than expected loss of  market share in the U.S.  LIQUIDITY McDonald's liquidity is supported by its FCF, cash balance, and a $2.5 billion  revolving credit facility that expires December 2019. As of Sept. 30, 2016,  liquidity totalled $4.8 billion and consisted of $2.3 billion of cash and $2.5  billion revolver availability. Debt maturities are estimated at $1.6 billion in  2017, $1.8 billion in 2018, and $1.5 billion in 2019. Fitch expects maturities  to be refinanced, as debt paydown is not anticipated.

1084,MCD,"McDonald's USA in tech push plans self-serve kiosks, mobile ordering","NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES(Reuters) - McDonald’s, aiming to become more modern and nimble, is updating U.S. restaurants with self-service kiosk ordering, mobile payments, “smart” menu boards, custom sandwiches and table service, executives said on Thursday. The 61-year-old fast-food company has been overhauling its food with simpler ingredients and selling breakfast items 24-hours a day, but it is playing catch up in the technology realm to early adopters such as Domino’s Pizza, Starbucks Corp and Panera Bread. About 500 of McDonald’s more than 14,000 U.S. restaurants have made the changes with Florida, New York and Southern California the first regions to adopt the new format. Restaurants in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago and Seattle will start making the switch next year, according to the company, which declined to give a timeline for how long the changes will take to go nationwide. McDonald’s will pilot mobile ordering in the United States in the first half of 2017 and do a national rollout in the second half, Chris Kempczinski, a former Kraft Foods executive who will take over as McDonald’s USA president on Jan. 1, told journalists at a press event in New York. Mobile ordering and payment will be added to the McDonald’s app, which has been downloaded by 16 million people, he said. Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said the company was in the early stage of using technology. “There is nothing more powerful than one-on-one customer experience” such as smartphone apps, he said to Reuters. Still, some of McDonald’s U.S. franchisees have chafed at the prospect of making significant investments at a time when labor costs are rising and restaurant sales growth is tepid.  Analysts note that just 50 percent of U.S. McDonald’s restaurants have been recently renovated, and the company wants new food and tech elements in addition to the restaurant makeovers. The cost of installing kiosks is between $50,000 and $60,000 and the company is willing to help with money or financing, McDonald’s executives said. Eastbrook has said that equipment is not expected to reduce the number of workers in restaurants, since traditional order takers would be redeployed to help customers learn to operate kiosks and to deliver food to tables.  Demonstrating returns is key to convincing franchisees to make the switch, executives said. In a video, one UK executive said sales grew 8 percent in downtown London as a result of the initiative.  “People may not always like to change, but people like to make money,” Kempczinski told Reuters. McDonald’s USA draws on results from modernization projects in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada as it pushes the effort. “We’ve worked a lot of the kinks out,” Easterbrook told Reuters.  Kempczinski said McDonald’s may also pick up the pace of its response to consumer demands for simpler, more natural food.  McDonald’s USA already has switched to chicken raised without antibiotics important to human health, replaced margarine with butter in its Egg McMuffins, and swapped sugar for high-fructose corn syrup in its hamburger buns. Most recently, it said it would fully transition to cage-free eggs in the United States and Canada over the next decade.

1085,MCD,McDonald's investor renews push for antibiotic reduction in all meat,"(Reuters) - A McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) shareholder is redoubling efforts to convince the fast-food chain to stop all of its global restaurants from serving the meat of animals raised with antibiotics that are vital for fighting human infections. More than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned that the routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant “superbug” infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health. The Congregation of Benedictine Sisters of Boerne, Texas, asked directors at McDonald’s to prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics in its global poultry supply chain. McDonald’s already has adopted that policy for the chicken served in its U.S. restaurants.  The group also asking the fast-food chain to set global targets and timelines for switching to pork and beef raised without the non-therapeutic use of medically important antibiotics. Just over 20 percent of McDonald’s shareholders voted in favor of a similar proposal at this year’s annual meeting. The sisters pulled a prior resolution after McDonald’s announced its plans to change its policies on chicken in the United States. The sisters aim to have shareholders vote on the new proposal at McDonald’s 2017 annual meeting.     McDonald’s told Reuters it continues “to engage with key experts, including some who serve as advisors to the World Health Organization (WHO), to advance progress across the industry.”  The company said its current policy “provides guidance to our suppliers in parts of the world where the industry does not yet have systems in place that would allow them to verify compliance throughout the supply chain.” Sister Susan Mika said the resolution is part of an ongoing process. “I said we will be back,” Mika said in a phone interview. “We want them to set  goals and to be moving in a certain direction. We expect them to be a leader in taking on these questions of our time.”      The sisters are part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), which along with ShareAction, Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative and As You Sow, also are targeting companies such as Sanderson Farms (SAFM.O) and Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) with similar campaigns aimed at preserving the efficacy of antibiotics.

In a brief filed Friday, McDonald’s, represented by Jones Day, tried to convince a federal judge for a second time to stop a lawsuit from proceeding under a theory of ostensible agency, a California common law doctrine that says a company can be held liable for labor law violations if workers reasonably believed it was their employer. The laws that the plaintiffs sued under, however, McDonald’s argued, limit liability to those that have control over working conditions.

1090,MCD,McDonald's drops supplier in Malaysia over worker exploitation claims,"KUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fast food giant McDonald’s said it has dropped a labor supply agency in Malaysia after claims emerged that it was underpaying its migrant workers and housing them in appalling conditions. An investigation by British newspaper the Guardian said the agency supplying workers to McDonald’s was withholding their salaries, which were as low as 75 U.S. cents an hour, underpaying promised wages, and confiscating their passports. The report was based on interviews with 15 Nepali workers who had worked at different McDonald’s restaurants in the capital Kuala Lumpur. McDonald’s said it has ended its contract with the agency,  Human Connection HR, and pledged staff welfare is a “top priority”, with companies globally under mounting pressure to ensure their supply chains are free of slavery and exploitation. “Earlier this year, we became aware of certain circumstances relating to services provided by Human Connection HR which were not in compliance with our standards,” spokesman Ron Christianson said in a statement. “As a result, we have terminated our contract with them.” There was no suggestion of any wrongdoing by McDonald’s. Human Connection HR said it will hold a meeting and issue a response soon.  Christianson would not confirm details of the exploitation, saying the workers were employees of the labor agency. “Because the workers are not employees of McDonald’s, our efforts to address the issues were unsuccessful, as were proposals for McDonald’s to assume responsibility for paying workers directly,” he said. Human Connection HR had been supplying workers to McDonald’s in Malaysia for “a number of years”, Christianson added. He said the company’s suppliers were bound to uphold a code of conduct which includes safeguarding worker’s rights. McDonald’s hires over 12,000 people in Malaysia, and less than 5 percent are foreign workers. Malaysia, which is Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy,  relies heavily on foreign workers especially in construction, plantation and domestic work, but human rights campaigners have long voiced concerns that they face widespread abuses. Aegile Fernandez, director at Kuala Lumpur-based migrant rights group Tenaganita, said labor exploitation happens “almost everyday” among multinational firms in the country. She urged McDonald’s to take responsibility and ensure its supply chain is free of exploitation and slavery. “They can’t run away because they are the main company,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “No matter if you’re in the United States or Europe, you have to ensure your suppliers are following all the regulations and upholding the rights of the workers.” ",12012016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-rights-labour/mcdonalds-drops-supplier-in-malaysia-over-worker-exploitation-claims-idUSKBN13Q53M

The deal is likely to be signed before Christmas, the source said. Reuters had reported in October that U.S. buyout firms Carlyle and Bain Capital LLC had been the front runners among the bidders for the fast-food giant’s China assets. McDonald’s in March said it was reorganizing operations in Asia, bringing in partners as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model.  The company hired Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to run the sale of about 2,400 restaurants in China and Hong Kong. Financial Times reported earlier on Wednesday that Bain Capital had dropped out of the race, and that a group led by Citic Group and Carlyle were the front runners to the deal.

1094,MCD,"Exclusive: McDonald's to keep up to 25 percent stake in China, HK stores - source","HONG KONG (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) is looking to raise $1 billion to $2 billion with the sale of its China and Hong Kong stores after the U.S. fast-food chain decided to keep “a significant minority stake in the business,” a person with direct knowledge of the plans said on Tuesday. The company has picked a consortium led by private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) and Chinese conglomerate CITIC Group Corp [CITIC.UL] to buy the stores and its decision to retain a stake of up to 25 percent lowered the price tag for the business from up to $3 billion expected previously, said the person, who declined to be identified because details of the deal are not public. McDonald’s wants exposure to future growth in the world’s second-largest economy which is why it decided to maintain the stake, the person said. The company will also keep for now its stores in South Korea, which it previously also wanted to sell, the person added. A McDonald’s spokeswoman in Shanghai declined to comment. Carlyle declined to comment and CITIC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. McDonald’s in March said it was reorganizing operations in the region, looking for strategic partners in China, Hong Kong and South Korea as it switches to a less capital-intensive franchise model. McDonald’s owns most of its more than 2,800 restaurants in the three markets. It is offering a 20-year franchise to buyers with a 10-year extension option. The Chinese and Hong Kong stores attracted bids from a variety of parties, including TPG Capital Management LP [TPG.UL] - which teamed up with mini-market operator Wumart Stores Inc - and real estate firm Sanpower Group Co Ltd [SPGCL.UL], which owns British department store House of Fraser Ltd [HFPLC.UL], Reuters previously reported. The sale comes at time when fast-food operators including McDonald’s and Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N) are recovering from a series of food-supply scandals in China that have undermined their performance. Yum, best known for the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands, agreed to sell a $460 million stake in its China unit to investment firm Primavera Capital and an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) ahead of a planned spin-off of the business.

1095,MCD,China is still firmly on the menu for McDonald's,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China will still be on the menu for McDonald’s. The $100 billion U.S. burger giant is poised to sell its outlets in mainland China and Hong Kong for up to $2 billion. Seeing this as a simple retreat from the Middle Kingdom is tempting, but wrong. As elsewhere, franchising is a better business than owning and operating stores. There are other benefits to having a Chinese partner too. The Oak Brook, Illinois company has picked private equity firm Carlyle and local outfit CITIC Group as buyers, according to Reuters. While the mooted price tag is lower than earlier talk of a $3 billion price, that’s because McDonald’s is keeping a 25 percent interest. Higher than average royalty fees by the American parent may also cut the upfront proceeds too. The stake retention looks like classic “shmuck insurance” – keeping a slice to avoid seller’s remorse if things go better than expected. It could also help McDonald’s keep a closer quality control eye over an important part of its global empire.  China has been tricky for U.S. players, who have faced slowing growth, food scares, emerging local competitors and anti-American protests. For Yum Brands, whose network of KFC and Pizza Huts in China is three times larger than McDonald’s there, the answer was to spin Yum China off to shareholders.  But Chinese earnings will still matter to both parent companies, and both local arms will keep expanding at breakneck pace. McDonald’s has about 2,400 Chinese outlets, and will add 250 a year. The coffee world is equally enamoured of the Chinese consumer: Starbucks is opening a store every day on the mainland. For McDonald’s, the sale moves it closer to Chief Executive Stephen Easterbrook’s goal of having the vast majority of its restaurants operated by franchisees. That’s a more attractive business model, but franchising has only in recent years become straightforward in China.  Having a local ally in CITIC, China’s oldest financial conglomerate, could also help McDonald’s better understand local tastes and handle future difficulties. Yum China also brought in local partners. It is easier to bash a wholly American company than it is to bash one backed by the local establishment.",12082016,http://www.reuters.com/article/uk-mcdonalds-m-a-breakingviews/china-is-still-firmly-on-the-menu-for-mcdonalds-idUSKBN13X0TV
1096,MCD,McDonald's to move international tax base to UK amid EU scrutiny," (Story corrects paragraph 10 to replace U.S. drugmaker Allegion with U.S. lock maker Allegion) (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) said on Thursday it would move its international tax base to the United Kingdom from Luxembourg after coming under increased scrutiny from European Union regulators over its tax arrangements in the small country. McDonald’s said it would create a new international holding company domiciled in the UK that would receive the majority of  royalties from licensing deals outside the United States. “We are aligning our corporate structure with the way we do business, which is no longer in geographies, but in segments that group together countries with common market and growth characteristics,” McDonald’s said in a statement. The move will also help to cut costs, McDonald’s said. The reorganization comes amid an investigation by the EU into what it says are sweetheart tax deals that smaller states in the bloc offer to multinational companies to lure jobs and investment. In August, the EU ordered Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of up to 13 billion euros ($13.8 billion), ruling that the iPhone maker had received illegal state aid. McDonald’s potentially faced an order from the bloc to pay back taxes of $500 million to Luxembourg, the Financial Times reported in September.  The company said in July it would create over 5,000 jobs in Britain by the end of 2017, in a sign of its commitment to the country after the vote on June 23 to leave the EU. A number of international companies have shifted their corporate registration or primary tax residence to the UK since Britain relaxed its rules on the taxation of companies’ foreign subsidiaries in 2012. These include U.S. lock maker Allegion (ALLE.N), U.S. insurer Aon (AON.N) and Italian tractor maker CNH Industrial (CNHI.MI). Under UK rules, profits earned by overseas arms or a UK-registered company are effectively exempt from UK tax even if the income is untaxed. Tax campaigners say this allows companies shift profits out of the UK before being taxed and then allows companies bring the money back tax free. The moves studied by Reuters create few if any jobs and have helped the companies slash their tax bills. reut.rs/2gozu2E McDonald’s shares were up 0.6 percent at $120.63 at midday.

1106,MCD,McDonald's U.S. restaurant sales fall after five quarters of gains,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp’s (MCD.N) sales at established U.S. restaurants fell for the first time in six quarters as the novelty of all-day breakfast failed to overcome competition from supermarkets and other food sellers.   Shares of McDonald’s were down 0.5 percent at $121.60 after the world’s biggest fast-food chain released its fourth-quarter report on Monday.  McDonald’s and other U.S. restaurant operators are battling competition from convenience stores, supermarkets and meal kit delivery services such as Blue Apron.  The challenge from grocers has been particularly daunting. Supermarkets have been passing lower food costs on to shoppers, while restaurants are raising menu prices to offset the impact of minimum wage increases. McDonald’s is “mindful of the disparity” in pricing, Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said on a conference call. He and other executives laid out plans to boost traffic by speeding up service, offering limited-time burger specials, testing home delivery, remodeling restaurants and investing in technology like automated ordering and payment through self-service kiosks and mobile devices.  Traffic has fallen more than 10 percent over the last four years at restaurants in the United States, McDonald’s most profitable market, according to a client note from RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer.  The decline coincided with McDonald’s marketing shift away from its  popular but profit-squeezing Dollar Menu. Sales at U.S. McDonald’s restaurants open at least 13 months fell 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter, squeaking by analysts’ estimates of a 1.4 percent drop, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. International results also beat analysts’ expectations, due to strength at restaurants in the UK, China, Japan and certain markets in Latin America. U.S. restaurants introduced all-day breakfast in October 2015 as part of Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook’s plan to reverse lagging sales.  Sales did benefit, which made year-earlier comparisons in the latest quarter difficult, McDonald’s said in a statement. “These changes were supposed to drive a steady and sustainable uplift in (consumer) spending rather than a one-off spike in sales, but it is increasingly clear that this strategy is not delivering,” Neil Saunders, head of retail analyst firm Consuming, said in an email. McDonald’s fourth-quarter revenue fell nearly 5 percent to $6.03 billion, mainly due to the sale of restaurants to franchisees as part of Easterbrook’s turnaround plan.

The operator of the world’s largest fast-food chain posted overall quarterly revenue that beat analysts’ expectations. The company’s stock initially rose in premarket trading on Monday, before reversing course to trade down 0.38 percent at $121.95. Sales at established McDonald’s restaurants in the United States declined 1.3 percent in the three months ended Dec. 31, hurt in part by the high bar set by the debut of the all-day breakfast in October 2015. Analysts on average were expecting a drop of 1.4 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. McDonald’s comparable international restaurant sales beat expectations due to a strong performance in the UK, China, Japan and certain markets in Latin America. Sales at international restaurants open at least 13 months rose 2.7 percent, edging past analysts’ average estimate of an increase of 2.6 percent. McDonald’s total revenue fell for the tenth straight quarter, mainly due to the sale of restaurants to franchisees as part of the company’s turnaround plan started in mid-2015. That plan by Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook also included the introduction of the all-day breakfast, banning the use of medically important antibiotics in U.S. chicken, and efforts towards faster and friendlier service. Total revenue fell nearly 5 percent to $6.03 billion in the latest quarter, beating analysts’ average estimate of $5.99 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Illinois-based company’s net income fell about 1 percent to $1.19 billion, or $1.44 per share, a year earlier.

McDonalds currently has three franchisees in Russia, two of which have been opening its outlets in the Urals and Siberia. Franchisees operate 92 restaurants out of its total of 609. “The (franchising) program will develop, we are looking for new partners,” Khasbulatov said. He added the company aimed to bring the share of local suppliers to almost 100 percent by the end of 2018 from the current 85 percent and was encouraging suppliers to develop production in Russia - a move likely to shield it from currency swings and any import restrictions.

1118,MCD,McDonald's CEO sounds positive note on Trump's Labor nominee,"BOSTON (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said on Thursday that President Donald Trump’s pick to head the U.S. Labor Department has a good understanding of entry-level jobs and how big changes in labor costs can affect small businesses. Easterbrook’s remarks are a measure of support for his fellow fast-food executive, Andrew Puzder, whose nomination as Labor Secretary has met delays and opposition, particularly from the union-backed “Fight for $15” movement to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. “I’ve not met him,” said Easterbrook, who runs the world’s largest fast-food restaurant chain. “What I would say is that it’s positive that he has a good, grassroots understanding of entry-level jobs. That is something that’s important to all of us.” Easterbrook made his remarks after giving a speech at the Boston College Chief Executives Club luncheon. McDonald’s has increased average worker pay to almost $10 per hour. But those raises are limited to just a fraction of all U.S. McDonald’s restaurant workers because franchisees operate almost 90 percent of the chain’s 14,000 domestic locations.  Puzder, who is the chief executive of CKE Restaurants, has been a vocal opponent of minimum wage increases and what he has called “overregulation” during the Obama administration. “He will have a first-hand experience of seeing the impact on a small business of the dramatic changes in any input costs,” Easterbrook said. “That experience will be important for him to make the right decision not just for business but for people as well.”  Earlier this week, the U.S. Senate panel tasked with vetting Puzder postponed its tentative plans to hold his confirmation hearing yet again, a move that some political strategists say could signal trouble. Last month, workers at franchised locations of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, which are part of CKE’s restaurant portfolio, filed a range of complaints, alleging wage theft and harassment, among other things. Additionally, some of CKE’s racy advertisements featuring women in bikinis have caused Democrats to raise questions about how Puzder would address sexual harassment in the workplace.

1120,MCD,Chinese firm files complaints with Chinese government over McDonald's China sale,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Chinese consultancy that has previously helped to win antitrust battles against Coca-Cola and Apple has taken aim at McDonald’s Corp, arguing in a complaint to regulators that the American fast food giant’s China sale may hurt workers and consumers. McDonald’s said last month it had agreed to sell the bulk of its China and Hong Kong business to state-backed conglomerate CITIC Ltd and U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group LP for up to $2.1 billion, in a deal that will see the consortium act as the master franchisee for a 20-year period. The complaint, which follows allegations from a U.S. labour union that the transaction will likely lead to poorer pay and conditions for McDonald’s 120,000 workers in China, could delay regulatory approval for the deal. Beijing-based Hejun Vanguard Group, a Chinese management consultancy that has a track-record of representing domestic companies against foreign firms, filed two separate complaints against McDonald’s with the Ministry of Commerce’s (MOFCOM) antimonopoly bureau and its franchise office, Hejun Vanguard told Reuters. While Hejun has stopped short of asking MOFCOM to block the deal, it has called on the regulator to closely scrutinize the transaction and take measures to prevent McDonald’s “abusing” what it claims is the company’s dominant position in the fast-food burger market in China.  It has also called for MOFCOM to investigate alleged violations of China’s franchise law by McDonald’s, which it claims has failed to properly register all of its outlets in  mainland China.  MOFCOM had yet to respond to a request for comment at the time of publication. CITIC, CITIC Capital and Carlyle declined to comment. McDonald’s said it had filed its franchise business with MOFCOM in accordance with franchise regulations, and disputes Hejun’s analysis of its market share in China. It added that its franchise model globally is based on mutually beneficial partnerships. Hejun said it was not acting for any specific companies in the case and generally seeks to protect domestic brands from overly aggressive foreign companies. The Service Employees International Union, a U.S. labour organization, last year warned potential buyers of roughly 3,000 McDonald’s restaurants in Asia that such deals could saddle them with operational risks, including significant costs and liabilities..  In January, it raised concerns over McDonald’s China deal, saying previous such transactions in markets - including Brazil and Puerto Rico - had put enormous pressure on franchisees, making it harder for them to provide adequate pay and conditions for their workers. CITIC and CITIC Capital, an affiliate company that manages private equity funds, will hold 52 percent of the China business following the deal. Carlyle will control 28 percent, while McDonald’s will retain a 20 percent stake.  McDonald’s currently owns and operates most of its outlets on the mainland but the deal will see the fast-foot giant move to a franchise model that should allow it to continue to profit from sales while cutting costs. “The deal will put enormous downward pressure on McDonald’s master franchisees, existing franchisees that operate individual stores, and the workers and customers of those stores,” said Li Su, CEO of Hejun Vanguard Group in a statement. “Regulators should investigate the transaction and impose restrictions to prevent McDonald’s from abusing its dominant market position.”  Hejun’s submission, excerpts of which were reviewed by Reuters, says its analysis shows McDonald’s has 53 percent of the fast-food burger market in China and that the company has abused its dominant position to extract higher than average royalties. McDonald’s will charge royalties of 6 percent of sales in China under the deal, compared with 3 percent globally, says Hejun, citing The Wall Street Journal.  “As McDonald’s extracts excessively high royalties and its partners see a deteriorating bottom line, corner-cutting can result in lower quality products and even health concerns,” the complaint claims. McDonald’s does not disclose its royalties and regards itself as a player in the “informal eating out” market, a company spokeswoman said, confirming that McDonald’s had filed the transaction for approval by MOFCOM. The company also pointed to awards recognising it as a top employer in China. “Franchising is a key factor underlying McDonald’s success across the world based on mutually beneficial partnership. Our local franchisees have also received a wide range of awards in recognition of their local people brand,” she added. Hejun has had success with such complaints in the past, opposing Coca-Cola’s acquisition of Huiyuan Juice, the first deal ever blocked by MOFCOM, and was part of the team that fought a claim to make Apple pay $60 million in 2012 to use the iPad trademark in China.  MOFCOM has the discretion to take into account third-party complaints against companies and Hejun expects any review to take at least two months, said Shaun Wu, a China disputes lawyer at law firm Kobre & Kim which is acting for Hejun.

1121,MCD,UPDATE 2-Chinese firm files complaints with Chinese government over McDonald's China sale,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Chinese consultancy that has previously helped to win antitrust battles against Coca-Cola and Apple has taken aim at McDonald’s Corp, arguing in a complaint to regulators that the American fast food giant’s China sale may hurt workers and consumers. McDonald’s said last month it had agreed to sell the bulk of its China and Hong Kong business to state-backed conglomerate CITIC Ltd and U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group LP for up to $2.1 billion, in a deal that will see the consortium act as the master franchisee for a 20-year period. The complaint, which follows allegations from a U.S. labour union that the transaction will likely lead to poorer pay and conditions for McDonald’s 120,000 workers in China, could delay regulatory approval for the deal. Beijing-based Hejun Vanguard Group, a Chinese management consultancy that has a track-record of representing domestic companies against foreign firms, filed two separate complaints against McDonald’s with the Ministry of Commerce’s (MOFCOM) antimonopoly bureau and its franchise office, Hejun Vanguard told Reuters. While Hejun has stopped short of asking MOFCOM to block the deal, it has called on the regulator to closely scrutinize the transaction and take measures to prevent McDonald’s “abusing” what it claims is the company’s dominant position in the fast-food burger market in China.  It has also called for MOFCOM to investigate alleged violations of China’s franchise law by McDonald’s, which it claims has failed to properly register all of its outlets in  mainland China.  MOFCOM had yet to respond to a request for comment at the time of publication. CITIC, CITIC Capital and Carlyle declined to comment. McDonald’s said it had filed its franchise business with MOFCOM in accordance with franchise regulations, and disputes Hejun’s analysis of its market share in China. It added that its franchise model globally is based on mutually beneficial partnerships. Hejun said it was not acting for any specific companies in the case and generally seeks to protect domestic brands from overly aggressive foreign companies. The Service Employees International Union, a U.S. labour organization, last year warned potential buyers of roughly 3,000 McDonald’s restaurants in Asia that such deals could saddle them with operational risks, including significant costs and liabilities..  In January, it raised concerns over McDonald’s China deal, saying previous such transactions in markets - including Brazil and Puerto Rico - had put enormous pressure on franchisees, making it harder for them to provide adequate pay and conditions for their workers.

The fast-food giant said last month it had agreed to sell the bulk of its China and Hong Kong business to state-backed conglomerate CITIC Ltd and U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group LP in a deal that will see the consortium act as the master franchisee for a 20-year period. The HKCTU’s statement on Monday comes just days after a Chinese consultancy, Hejun Vanguard Group, filed a formal complaint with China’s Ministry of Commerce also claiming the decision to move to a master-franchisee model may hurt its 120,000 workers in China, as well as consumers. The union group said the deal would put further pressure on pay at the U.S. company’s Hong Kong outlets, where many workers earn just above the current minimum wage of HK$32.5 ($4.20) per hour. The group represents 90 affiliate organizations and 170,000 members.  “In other countries where McDonald’s has sold a large stake of its business, the resulting model has placed enormous pressure on franchisees, which has made it harder for franchise operators to provide adequate pay and conditions for their workers,” HKCTU official Wong Yu Loy said in the statement. “If the buyers in Hong Kong get squeezed by McDonald’s as they have in other countries, workers here may get even less as a result,” Wong said.  McDonald’s said its franchise model globally is based on mutually beneficial partnerships and the company “treasures” employees as its most important asset. “McDonald’s strictly abides by Hong Kong labor legislation and the statutory requirements,” said a spokeswoman for the fast-food company. “The level of remuneration of our employees is based on their positions, working experience, expertise, performance, as well as market conditions.

The company’s U.S. restaurants have suffered four straight years of traffic declines, resulting in 500 million lost transactions since 2012. As part of the push for greater convenience in the United States, which contributes more operating income than any other global market, McDonald’s will also offer curbside pickup of orders to reduce wait time at drive-thrus. McDonald’s will start to roll out “mobile order and pay” in the fourth quarter and have it available at all of its roughly 14,000 U.S. restaurants by year-end, Chris Kempczinski, president of McDonald’s USA, said at the company’s investor meeting in Chicago on Wednesday. Customers who use the app will have the option to pick up orders at drive-thru windows or in designated curbside delivery parking spots, where a restaurant worker will hand off orders. Customers could also choose to pick up orders at restaurant counters. Service times at McDonald’s have recently slowed, and the new initiatives are expected to cut wait times, shorten drive-thru lines and prevent customers from skipping visits due to long delays, said Jim Sappington, McDonald’s executive vice president of operations, digital and technology.  McDonald’s has lagged other fast-food restaurants such as Domino’s Pizza Inc (DPZ.N), Panera Bread Co PNRA.O and Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) in its use of digital technology. The goal is “progress over perfection,” said Sappington, who added that McDonald’s will also debut “mobile order and pay” in about 6,000 international locations by year-end as it works to add a loyalty program and customization.  Mobile ordering should reduce errors and significantly cut the time it takes to handle large, complex orders. The new initiatives could shift some 20 percent of drive-thru orders to curbside delivery and another 20 percent to drive-thru pickup only, executives said. “Decongesting” the drive-thru in such a way could result in 20 more cars per hour and incremental sales, said Chief  Executive Steve Easterbrook. McDonald’s also plans to expand delivery in the United States, which it is testing with UberEATS in Florida, and begin trying it in other countries. McDonald’s said it would use a part of the savings from  refranchising restaurants outside the United States to get to 2,500 “Experience of the Future” restaurant revamps by the end  of 2017. Those restaurants include self-service kiosks, table service and reconfigured kitchens designed to slash the distance a restaurant’s workers walk on a given day by as much as seven miles.

Digital ordering has been challenging for many restaurant chains and their customers. Domino’s Pizza Inc, now the industry leader, took years to perfect it. Starbucks’ technology took far less time, but in January the chain said mobile orders poured in faster than they could be processed, creating backlogs that drove away time-crunched walk-in customers. McDonald’s sees mobile as a way to win back customers after four straight years of traffic declines, but the project is not without risks. “We can’t impact the speed or the quality of our food,” Jim Sappington, McDonald’s executive vice president of operations, digital and technology, told Reuters in an interview at a temporary warehouse space in Chicago’s West Loop where the company has built a new high tech restaurant. It features a redesigned kitchen to speed order flow and show off its technology initiatives. If its famous french fries are served cold or if mobile customers have to wait for orders, “you get a question of ‘Why did I use the app?’,” Sappington said. “Our focus is to make the overall experience clearly better.” McDonald’s said that automating more orders should cut transaction times, reduce errors and free up workers to do things like deliver food to tables or cars in spots designated for mobile orders. “It’s better to be right than to be first to market,”      McDonald’s Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said recently. To that end, Sappington plans multiple pilot tests to work out any kinks and streamline the integration with the company’s existing technology systems before rolling out the finished app in nearly all 14,000 U.S. restaurants and some 6,000 others in Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Australia and China, by the end of this year. LOW-TECH SOLUTIONS Kitchens are the heart of McDonald’s business and crucial to the success of mobile ordering. “The potential is that they can screw up the flow of the whole restaurant,” said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at Oakbrook Investments LLC, which holds 65,000 McDonald’s shares. McDonald’s appears to be taking steps to protect itself from kitchen hiccups, she added. McDonald’s is bringing restaurant operators to its Chicago warehouse space to show off a “hub and spoke” kitchen layout developed in French restaurants after the installation of self-service ordering kiosks. Among other things, that kitchen system clusters food preparation to increase efficiency, shaving miles off the daily distances covered by a restaurant’s crew. Franchisees who operate most U.S. McDonald’s restaurants will be tasked with sorting out the human elements of mobile ordering - namely how to best adjust kitchen layouts, work flows and staffing, said Richard Adams, a former McDonald’s franchisee who now advises McDonald’s restaurant operators. Unlike many others, McDonald’s app will track a customer’s location to ensure that orders are sent to the right restaurant and timed so that food is not left to wilt under heat lamps. When the customer arrives at the restaurant, the app asks for confirmation and payment before sending orders to the kitchen. “If they don’t start your order until you pull in the lot, are you really gaining that much time?” investor Sampson asked. The final version of the app will also ask customers to choose table service, counter or drive-through pickup, or curbside delivery. Easterbrook said that if 20 percent of drive-through customers use curbside and another 20 percent use the lanes for pickup only, restaurants could serve another 20 cars per hour, lifting business at U.S. drive-throughs that account for some 70 percent of U.S. sales.

When the customer arrives at the restaurant, the app asks for confirmation and payment before sending orders to the kitchen.    “If they don’t start your order until you pull in the lot, are you really gaining that much time?” investor Sampson asked.    The final version of the app will also ask customers to choose table service, counter or drive-through pickup, or curbside delivery.       Easterbrook said if 20 percent of drive-through customers use curbside and another 20 percent use the lanes for pickup only, restaurants could serve another 20 cars per hour, lifting business at U.S. drive-throughs that account for some 70 percent of sales in the country.

1133,MCD,"UPDATE 1-McDonald's, late to mobile ordering, seeks to avoid pitfalls","CHICAGO (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp has begun testing its long-awaited U.S. mobile ordering app, with the goal of avoiding the kinds of service hiccups that have haunted digital debuts by companies such as Starbucks Corp. Digital ordering has been challenging for many restaurant chains and their customers. Domino’s Pizza Inc, now the industry leader, took years to perfect it. Starbucks’ technology took far less time, but in January the chain said mobile orders poured in faster than they could be processed, creating backlogs that drove away time-crunched walk-in customers. McDonald’s sees mobile as a way to win back customers after four straight years of traffic declines, but the project is not without risks.            “We can’t impact the speed or the quality of our food,” Jim Sappington, McDonald’s executive vice president of operations, digital and technology, told Reuters in an interview at a temporary warehouse space in Chicago’s West Loop where the company has built a new high tech restaurant. It features a redesigned kitchen to speed order flow and show off its technology initiatives. If its famous french fries are served cold or if mobile customers have to wait for orders, “you get a question of ‘Why did I use the app?’,” Sappington said. “Our focus is to make the overall experience clearly better.” McDonald’s said that automating more orders should cut transaction times, reduce errors and free up workers to do things like deliver food to tables or cars in spots designated for mobile orders.     “It’s better to be right than to be first to market,” McDonald’s Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said recently. The fast-food chain said it began testing its mobile ordering and payment app at 29 restaurants in Monterey and Salinas, California, on Wednesday.  The pilot test will expand to an additional 51 restaurants in Spokane, Washington, on March 20, it added.  Sappington plans multiple pilot tests to collect customer feedback, work out any kinks and streamline the integration with the company’s existing technology systems before rolling out the finished app in nearly all 14,000 U.S. restaurants and some 6,000 others in Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Australia and China, by the end of this year.  LOW-TECH SOLUTIONS     Kitchens are the heart of McDonald’s business and crucial to the success of mobile ordering. “The potential is that they can screw up the flow of the whole restaurant,” said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at Oakbrook Investments LLC, which holds 65,000 McDonald’s shares. McDonald’s appears to be taking steps to protect itself from kitchen hiccups, she added.     McDonald’s is bringing restaurant operators to its Chicago warehouse space to show off a “hub and spoke” kitchen layout developed in French restaurants after the installation of self-service ordering kiosks.  Among other things, that kitchen system clusters food preparation to increase efficiency, shaving miles off the daily distances covered by a restaurant’s crew.      Franchisees who operate most U.S. McDonald’s restaurants will be tasked with sorting out the human elements of mobile ordering - namely how to best adjust kitchen layouts, work flows and staffing, said Richard Adams, a former McDonald’s franchisee who now advises McDonald’s restaurant operators.

1137,MCD,McDonald's shareholders to weigh giving franchisees board seat,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) investors will vote soon on whether to give the franchisees who operate most of the fast-food chain’s restaurants the opportunity to elect a board member, the proponent of a shareholder proposal said on Friday. The proposal, which faces long odds of success, is believed to be the first of its kind and has attracted great interest in the franchise community, which includes not only restaurants but also hotels and convenience stores among other businesses. Roughly 85 percent of the company’s restaurants are operated by franchisees, who pay rent and royalties to McDonald’s. McDonald’s long-term goal is to raise that to 95 percent. “We think franchisees should be in the room when the company’s most important decisions about operating and strategy are being made,” said Maureen O’Brien, director of corporate governance at Segal Marco Advisors, which provides advice to pension plans and oversees a trust owning more than 5,000 McDonald’s shares. O’Brien said the proposal was being made on behalf of investors, not franchisees.   McDonald’s, which petitioned regulators to omit the proposal from the ballot at its upcoming shareholder meeting, did not immediately comment.  But the company, which has been in turnaround mode for two years, recently said that franchisee cash flow growth is at or near all-time highs in many markets around the world. Franchisees recently have tangled with McDonald’s over everything from restaurant renovations to the popular but margin-squeezing Dollar Menu.  O’Brien said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected McDonald’s request, meaning the proposal will appear on the McDonald’s proxy due in the coming weeks. Under the proposal, McDonald’s would create a new class of stock that does not have monetary value but would allow  franchisees to elect one director, O’Brien said. The proposal is a long shot, but it could mark a big change in the board dynamic at McDonald’s and other heavily franchised U.S. restaurant chains if adopted, restaurant analysts and consultants said. “If you put a franchisee on the board, it could potentially have a major impact on the direction of the company. It’s a really significant role,” said Bob Goldin, partner and co-founder of food industry strategy firm Pentallect Inc. “If this happens, it won’t just be McDonald’s,” Goldin added, noting that McDonald’s is a bellwether for business.

1141,MCD,McDonald's Quarter Pounders to be made with fresh beef,"(Reuters) - Fast food chain McDonald’s Corp said on Thursday it would make its popular “Quarter Pounder” hamburgers with fresh beef, prepared when ordered, by mid-2018 in most of its U.S. restaurants. Investors and analysts said the move, which would compete with rival Wendy’s Co’s promise of “fresh never frozen beef”, could bolster sales but would require restaurant operators to make changes to cooking routines that could slow service.  It was not immediately clear what impact the use of fresh beef would have on margins at McDonald’s USA, which does not disclose what percentage of sales come from the Quarter Pounder. McDonald’s U.S. restaurants have suffered four straight years of traffic declines, resulting in 500 million lost transactions since 2012.  The multiyear turnaround plan launched by Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has included menu changes that address consumers’ demands for fresher, simpler food.  To that end, its U.S. restaurants have swapped butter for margarine in Egg McMuffins and stopped buying chicken meat from birds raised with antibiotics important to human health. “They’re trying to get people to give them another shot,” said Trip Miller, managing partner at Gullane Capital Partners, which holds 20,000 McDonald’s shares.  The question is whether the change will slow down service at restaurants, which are used to cooking frozen beef patties then holding them for use as needed, Miller said. Diners “say they want fresh and healthier, but they want it faster than ever,” he said.  Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy said the move to fresh beef could lift sales, although likely not to the degree associated with all-day breakfast after its debut in late 2015. “I don’t think it will move the needle like all-day breakfast did,” said Hottovy, who noted that the switch also will require restaurants to train workers how to safely handle fresh meat. Wendy’s teased its bigger rival with a Twitter message reading: “@McDonald’s So you’ll still use frozen beef in MOST of your burgers in ALL of your restaurants? Asking for a friend.” McDonald’s said it tested the new Quarter Pounders in about 400 restaurants in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and in Tulsa, Oklahoma. John Nalivka, president of meat consultancy Sterling Marketing, said there is not yet enough information on the quantity and cost of the fresh beef McDonald’s would be buying to know how that could affect the beef market or the company’s margins.

Wall Street gained as concerns about France’s election waned and investors cheered earnings from Dow components such as McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), up 5.6 percent, and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), up 7.9 percent. The Nasdaq Composite index closed above the 6,000 mark for the first time. “It’s earnings coming from the Dow companies, the largest of the large, in particular Caterpillar, really driving on the theme that U.S. corporate profitability is on track to really provide some significant year-over-year earnings growth,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. “That in and of itself is a fantastic story.”  Markets also built on the boost from the prior session in the wake of the first round of the French election, with recent opinion polls showing centrist Emmanuel Macron, who won with a comfortable lead over far-right, anti-EU candidate Marine Le Pen, winning a May 7 run-off vote. Safe-haven assets such as gold and the Japanese yen retreated, while the yield gap between French and German short-term government bonds, a closely watched measure of political risk in the euro zone, hit its lowest in almost three months.

Operating costs dropped nearly 12 percent.  Revenue fell 3.9 percent to $5.68 billion — the eleventh straight quarter of declines — mainly due to the sale of restaurants to franchisees as part of Easterbrook’s turnaround plan.

1154,MCD,GLOBAL MARKETS-Earnings boost equities with U.S. tax announcement eyed,"* Wall Street climbs, Nasdaq tops 6,000 mark * Oil edges up in choppy trade * Markets await Trump tax announcement on Wednesday (Adds close of European markets) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters) - Global stock markets rallied for a second consecutive day on Tuesday on solid U.S. earnings, aided by speculation about U.S. tax reform and reduced chances of a U.S. government shutdown this weekend. Wall Street gained as concerns about France’s election waned and investors cheered earnings from companies such as McDonald’s Corp, up 5.4 percent, and Caterpillar Inc, up 7.6 percent. The Nasdaq Composite index breached the 6,000 mark for the first time. “They are leading the train today,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York. “Part of it is just that momentum, you are caught in it but you can’t get in front of a moving train, so the momentum is such that you have to let it run.” Markets also maintained the boost from the French election results, with recent opinion polls have centrist Emmanuel Macron, who won with a comfortable lead over far-right, anti-EU candidate Marine Le Pen in a May 7 run-off vote. Safe-haven assets such as gold and the Japanese yen retreated, while the yield gap between French and German short-term government bonds, a closely watched measure of political risk in the euro zone, hit its lowest in almost three months.. Investor focus shifted to corporate earnings and U.S. President Donald Trump’s promise to announce “a big tax reform and tax reduction” on Wednesday. The threat of a U.S. government shutdown this weekend appeared to recede on Tuesday after Trump backed away from a demand that Congress include funding for his planned border wall with Mexico in a spending bill. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 254.13 points, or 1.22 percent, to 21,018.02, the S&P; 500 gained 15.88 points, or 0.67 percent, to 2,390.03 and the Nasdaq Composite added 45.95 points, or 0.77 percent, to 6,029.77. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.21 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.65 percent after touching a high of 456.42. French shares closed up 0.2 percent, after a 4.1 percent surge on Monday, their biggest daily gain since August 2012. The euro added to Monday’s gains against the dollar, up 0.63 percent to $1.0935. The Canadian dollar fell 0.6 percent to C$1.3583 per U.S. dollar after the United States announced new duties averaging 20 percent on Canadian softwood lumber imports. The Japanese yen weakened 1.26 percent versus the greenback at 111.14 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.2826, up 0.26 percent on the day. Gold, also seen as a safe-haven asset, fell. Spot gold dropped 0.9 percent to $1,263.26 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.98 percent to $1,265.00 an ounce. Oil prices edged up in choppy trade on Tuesday as U.S. crude inventory data that was forecast to show a drawdown faced doubts about OPEC’s ability to reduce a global glut. U.S. crude rose 0.39 percent to $49.42 per barrel and Brent was last at $51.93, up 0.64 percent on the day.

1155,MCD,"UPDATE 4-McDonald's profit beats as turnaround gains steam, shares at record high","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit and U.S. same-restaurant sales on lower costs, all-day breakfast, $1 drinks and promotions on its popular Big Macs, signaling the company’s plan to keep customers coming back to its restaurants has gained traction. McDonald’s shares on Tuesday popped to an all-time high, jumping 5.3 percent to $141.31, after profit topped Wall Street’s estimate by 14 cents per share.

1161,MCD,Union calls for investigations of McDonald's rent policies,"LOS ANGELES, May 2 (Reuters) - The Service Employees International Union, backer of a five-year campaign to improve pay and job conditions for fast-food workers, on Tuesday asked Illinois and California officials to investigate how McDonald’s Corp calculates restaurant rents, which generate about one-fourth of its revenue. The union behind the “Fight for $15” campaign alleges that McDonald’s does not accurately or specifically disclose the formula used to set rents and that it charges far more than landlords of other fast-food chains. That makes it difficult for the company’s 2,500 U.S. franchisees to raise wages for restaurant crews, it says. “McDonald’s sky-high rents leave franchisees financially squeezed, making it difficult to impossible for many of them to pay workers anything more than minimum wage,” said Scott Courtney, executive vice president of the SEIU, in a press release announcing the request to the Illinois Attorney General’s office and the California Department of Business Oversight. “We are confident in the legality and appropriateness of our financial relations with our franchisees and our disclosures of those relationships,” McDonald’s said in a statement. “Our business model helps our franchisees secure prime real estate locations and reflects a significant level of company investment in the restaurant premises.” Officials in Illinois and California did not immediately respond to requests for comment. McDonald’s, unlike many other restaurant chains, either owns or holds long-term leases on its restaurant sites. It then leases or sublets properties to franchisees. Last year, the fast-food company collected over $6.1 billion in rent from its more than 31,000 franchised restaurants, according to regulatory filings. “This issue is always bubbling,” said John Gordon, founder of Pacific Management Consulting Group. SEIU’s move comes a week after McDonald’s Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook told investors that franchisees were overwhelmingly positive about the company’s now two-year old turnaround plan, which depends in part on convincing restaurant operators that growth is strong enough to justify pricey property renovations. Easterbrook in March told analysts that franchisees continue to generate cash flow growth at or near all-time highs in many of its markets around the world.

1162,MCD,Halfords boss swaps bikes for bras with M&S; move,"LONDON (Reuters) - Marks & Spencer has hired Jill McDonald to run its clothing division, betting that the boss of bike shop Halfords can bring her focus on improving stores and customer service to fix the struggling business. Despite never having sold clothes, McDonald will take on one of the biggest jobs in British fashion, freeing up M&S; CEO Steve Rowe to concentrate on running the overall company after he oversaw an improvement in its clothing performance. The selection of McDonald fits with Rowe’s strategy of getting the basics right by simplifying product ranges, improving quality and running fewer promotions, rather than chasing new fashion trends. “I am pleased with the progress we have made in clothing and home over the last year and the time is now right for this appointment,” Rowe said.   Marks was once the go-to destination on the British high street for clothes, selling everything from school uniforms to underwear to first interview suits. But the retailer has been squeezed in recent years by the arrival of fast, cheap fashion at one end of the market and more affordable luxury at the other. Under Rowe’s new leadership the clothes division reported an increase in quarterly sales for the first time in nearly two years at the end of 2016, helping the 133-year-old company soundly beat forecasts for Christmas trading. Set to join in the autumn, McDonald has spent the last two years running the bicycles-to-car-parts retailer Halfords and before that she was head of the fast-food chain McDonald’s in Britain and worked for British Airways. Analysts say McDonald focused on improving customer service within the 460 Halfords stores, persuading shoppers to buy on the high street rather than online. But the company’s shares fell 17 percent while she was there, hurt by the impact of a weaker pound driving up import costs. “This is an interesting appointment from an M&S; perspective since McDonald ... cannot be seen as a clothing expert. What she does bring is considerable experience in marketing and customer relationship management, which have become even greater areas of focus under Steve Rowe’s tenure,” said Canaccord Genuity analysts. In her new role, McDonald will have overall responsibility for all aspects of the M&S; business outside food, which covers clothing, homeware and beauty products.  This will include setting the strategy for design and sourcing through to supply chains and logistics. She will report directly to Rowe. Rowe, who has been in the top job for just over a year, will relinquish his direct oversight of the clothing business, as will the firm’s finance director Helen Weir. Analysts at Investec said Halfords was in much better shape than when McDonald joined in May 2015.  “The company is 18 months into her ‘Moving up a Gear’ strategy,” they said. “Systems and processes have continued to be modernized. Halfords is more customer-centric.” Halfords Group shares were down 2.8 percent at 1000 GMT while M&S; was down 1.1 percent, both underperforming the FTSE 100 Index which was down 0.3 pct.

1163,MCD,"UPDATE 2-Value meals drive Wendy's profit, sales beat; shares soar","(Reuters) - Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) reported quarterly same-restaurant sales and profit that topped estimates, driven by the popularity of its value meals and lower costs, sending its shares to their highest in nearly a decade in morning trading on Wednesday. The U.S. burger chain has been promoting its value meals such as “4 for $4” to attract diners, as grocery prices have fallen in recent months, encouraging more people to cook at home. Wendy’s in January added the Double Stack cheeseburger, which includes a burger, chicken nuggets, a small serving of fries and a drink, to its “4 for $4” value meals. The company brought back its popular North Pacific Cod sandwich and also promoted its Ranch Chicken Club sandwich more in the first quarter, which helped push up same-restaurant sales to 1.6 percent, beating the 1.1 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix. Consumers continue to spend less and save more despite higher discretionary income, leading Wendy’s and rivals to increase promotions on their value offerings, Wendy’s Chief Financial Officer Gunther Plosch said on a conference call. The company said it did not see any material impact from McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) testing “Quarter Pounder” hamburgers made with fresh beef in Dallas. McDonald’s announced the test in March, a move that was expected to give competition to Wendy’s promise of “fresh never frozen beef”, but would require restaurant operators to make changes to cooking routines that could slow service.   Wendy’s said it would continue to offer more value-oriented products such as its 50 cent Frosty. General and administrative expenses fell 19 percent to $52.4 million in the first quarter ended April 2, due to lower professional fees, lesser incentive compensation payout and as the company sold more restaurants to franchisees. Net income fell to $22.3 million from $25.4 million in the quarter. On a per share basis, the company’s profit remained unchanged at 9 cents per share, due to fewer outstanding shares from a year earlier. Revenue fell 24.5 percent to $285.8 million from a year earlier, mainly because the company sold more restaurants to franchisees. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 8 cents per share on revenue of $282.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wendy’s shares rose as much as 6.8 percent to $16.12 in morning trading on Wednesday. Up to Tuesday’s close, the stock has risen about 12 percent since the start of the year.

1167,MCD,'Fight for 15' targets McDonald's shareholder meeting,"OAK BROOK, Ill. (Reuters) - Hundreds of fast-food workers demanding wage increases marched on Wednesday outside of the McDonald’s Corp  headquarters in a Chicago suburb during the company’s annual shareholder meeting. The demonstrators were part of a larger, nationwide protest organized by the labor group “Fight for 15,” which has regularly targeted McDonald’s calling for higher pay and union rights for workers. Dozens of protesters also rallied outside of United Airlines shareholder meeting in downtown Chicago. “I saw my mother, who worked 30 years for Hardees, struggle on food stamps to raise her family and now I’m doing the same thing,” said Terrance Wise, a 42-year-old from Kansas City who was protesting outside the McDonald’s meeting. Wise said he has worked at McDonald’s for three years and still only earns $7.65 an hour for the full-time job. He said he also relies on food stamps to support his three daughters. “Instead of paying their CEO $15 million, they should give him $10 million and pay their workers what’s right,” he said. The Fight for 15 group’s main demand is for a minimum wage of $15 an hour. Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook earned $15.3 million in total compensation last year, according to company data. Shareholders inside the McDonald’s meeting did not ask about the protests during a question and answer session with company officials. Easterbrook focused on the fast-food giant’s plans for delivering food with UberEats and the roll out of new products. The company said on Wednesday it invests in its workers by helping them to earn degrees and acquire on-the-job skills. In 2015, the company raised the average hourly pay to around $10 for workers in the restaurants it owns. However, most U.S. McDonald’s workers are employed by franchisees who set their own wages. Workers’ hopes for an increase in the $7.25-per-hour federal minimum wage were dashed last year when Republicans retained control of Congress in the U.S. election. Opponents of raising the minimum wage say higher costs would force restaurants to cut hiring, and some businesses would not survive. Still, voters in Arizona, Colorado, Maine and Washington have approved state minimum wage increases, encouraging advocates to continue pressing their case at local levels. Workers on Wednesday also gathered outside of McDonald’s near downtown Los Angeles. Scores of protesters were arrested during a nationwide protest weeks after Republican Donald Trump won the White House in the November election. At various times on the campaign trail, Trump suggested U.S. workers were overpaid, but also that the minimum wage should be raised. “I can’t take care of my kids. We need to be paid a living wage,” said Betty Douglas, a 59-year-old mother of three and McDonald’s employee said on Wednesday in Oak Brook.

Medical researchers say overuse of the drugs may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans by contributing to the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant bacteria often referred to as “superbugs.” Restaurant chains such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, Panera Bread Co, McDonald’s Corp and Subway already have joined the fight against superbugs by working with their meat suppliers to curb the use of important human antibiotics.  In-N-Out last year told Reuters it was “committed to beef that is not raised with antibiotics important to human medicine and we’ve asked our suppliers to accelerate their progress toward establishing antibiotic alternatives.”  The company did not set a timeline for that effort. Company representatives were not immediately available to comment on Thursday. “In-N-Out can make a significant impact by eliminating all routine uses of medically important antibiotics by its beef suppliers in a timely manner,” the groups, including CALPIRG, Friends of the Earth and the Center for Food Safety, said in their letter to the California-based company. They want In-N-Out to begin selling a domestically produced grass-fed or organic beef burger. “It’s the fastest way that they can make good on their commitment,” said Kari Hamerschlag, senior program manager at  Friends of the Earth. On Jan. 1, California will implement a new law that limits the use of medically important antibiotics in livestock operations. The law prohibits the regular use of antibiotics important to human medicine for disease prevention purposes and is intended to increase local supplies of beef raised without such drugs.  On Wednesday, a shareholder proposal calling on McDonald’s to curb antibiotic use in its pork and beef supplies, as it does with chicken, was approved by 30 percent of voters.  Scientists say human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose a grave threat to global health and are estimated to kill at least 23,000 Americans each year. A recent Reuters investigation found that many infection-related deaths are  uncounted.

1173,MCD,Maryland joins California in battling antibiotic overuse on farms,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Maryland has become the second U.S. state to pass a law banning the routine use of antibiotics in healthy livestock and poultry, a move aimed at battling the rise of dangerous antibiotic-resistant bacteria known as “superbugs.” Maryland’s Keep Antibiotics Effective Act, which aims to end a practice that public health experts say can fuel the spread of superbugs, takes effect on Oct. 1 after Governor Larry Hogan declined to sign or veto it last week. Farmers in Maryland have until Jan. 1, 2018, to comply with the law. Roughly 70 percent of antibiotics important for human medicine are sold in the United States for use in meat and dairy production. Medical researchers say overuse of such drugs diminishes their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans by contributing to antibiotic resistance. The World Health Organization has warned that human infections from antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose a grave threat to global health. Such infections are estimated to kill at least 23,000 Americans annually, although a recent Reuters investigation found that many infection-related deaths are uncounted. California in 2015 adopted tough rules for antibiotic use on farms. Its law, which takes effect on Jan. 1, also restricts the regular use of antibiotics for disease prevention and bans antibiotic use to fatten up animals. The laws in Maryland and California go further than the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s guidelines, which seek to prohibit the use of antibiotics for growth promotion in farm animals but do not address the routine use of antibiotics for disease prevention.  The new state rules reserve antibiotic use solely for the treatment of sick animals or to control a verified disease outbreak, not for routine disease prevention, said Matthew Wellington, antibiotics program director for U.S. PIRG, which supported the Maryland legislation. Opponents included the Maryland Farm Bureau. The laws come as restaurant chains such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, Panera Bread Co, McDonald’s Corp and Subway are working with their meat suppliers to curb the use of important human antibiotics. Maryland-based Perdue Farms, a major U.S. poultry supplier and the state’s largest, is already compliant.

1175,MCD,UPDATE 4-Olympics-McDonald's ends Olympics sponsorship deal early,"NEW YORK/BERLIN (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) ended its 41-year-old sponsorship of the Olympic Games three years early, the International Olympic Committee said on Friday, reflecting the U.S. fast-food giant’s focus on its core business as well as rising Olympics sponsorship costs and declining TV ratings.  McDonald’s deal would have run through the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, and bowing out will likely to save it hundreds of million of dollars if it had continued into the next four-year Olympics cycle and beyond.  McDonald’s has been trying to hold down costs as it invests in improving food quality, restaurant service and online ordering to woo back U.S. diners. Intense competition has gnawed away at sales. “We are reconsidering all aspects of our business and have made this decision in cooperation with the IOC to focus on different priorities,” said McDonald’s Global Chief Marketing Officer Silvia Lagnado. The company, first involved with the games in 1968 and a sponsor since 1976, was the Olympics’ food retail sponsor. Despite pulling out with immediate effect, McDonald’s will continue at next year’s Pyeongchang winter Olympics as a domestic sponsor. The company’s move may also reflect a rising view among consumer brands that exclusive Olympics sponsorship deals do not offer the marketing impact they once did. Some companies find it is much cheaper to work directly with athletes or specific countries than the IOC.  Moreover, in a trend that began after the Beijing games in 2008, shrinking television audiences for the games could be diminishing the value of sponsors’ ads. With the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016, many viewers turned to social media alternatives like Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Facebook Inc (FB.O).  In the United States, Comcast Corp’s (CMCSA.O) NBCUniversal said it had attracted 8.6 percent fewer eyeballs for Rio than it did for London in 2012. The fast food chain has been part of the IOC’s top sponsors program that contributes more than $1 billion in each four-year cycle for the games. While terms of Olympic sponsorship are not disclosed, a source who negotiated previous IOC sponsorship deals said that top global sponsors like McDonald’s spend about $25 million a  year or about $100 million for a four-year period that includes a summer and winter games.     Reuters previously reported that the IOC had wanted to roughly double fees to $200 million per four year period starting in 2021. While it is unusual for an Olympic sponsor to leave early, sponsors change regularly within the IOC’s top program. The most recent addition was China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N), which signed a deal in January for a partnership through 2028.  The next three Olympics take place in Asia, and this could turn off U.S. sponsors trying to reach a U.S. audience. The U.S. Olympic Committee also has lost recent sponsors such as AT&T; (T.N) and Citigroup (C.N) ahead of the 2018 winter games in South Korea.  The IOC said it was not planning a direct replacement for McDonald’s, but it is expected to announce a new global deal with Intel Corp (INTC.O) next week, according a source familiar with the matter. Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  “Companies with a deep focus on technology are barging in while others migrate out,” said Peter Land, who works with Olympics and Paralympics sponsors for communications firm Finsbury.  The IOC has faced criticism from public health campaigners for allowing sponsors such as Coca-Cola (KO.N) and McDonald’s to use the games to market their products, which are perceived to be unhealthy. John Lewicki, who oversees global Olympic sponsorship deals for McDonald’s, said last year the company would reevaluate its Olympic relationship after changes to a rule that ended a marketing blackout for companies that sponsor athletes rather than the event itself. Shares of McDonald’s rose $1.06, or about 0.7 percent on Friday.

1179,MCD,Will McDonald's customers wait for the new Quarter Pounder?,"LOS ANGELES/DALLAS (Reuters) - Tracy Moore grew impatient as she waited for a Quarter Pounder recently in the parking lot of a McDonald’s restaurant in central Dallas.  The burger, made with fresh beef and billed as hotter and juicer than the original made from a frozen patty, is part of the company’s effort to serve tastier food.  But after about four minutes, it was Moore who was steamed. Like other customers who’d ordered the new Quarter Pounder at the restaurant’s drive-through, she was asked to pull into a parking space and wait. “If it’s going to be that long every time, I won’t order it. I’d go” elsewhere, said Moore, who hits the drive-through every morning for a Coke and dines frequently at the chain. The tradeoff between time and taste looms large for McDonald’s Corp as it works to win back business lost to rivals. The introduction of cooked-to-order, quarter-pound burgers made with fresh beef is part of the chain’s attempt to improve food quality. Announced in March, the new sandwiches are already in selected test markets and are expected to be served in all U.S. stores by mid-2018. But the success of the initiative may well hinge on satisfying important customers like Moore: speed-minded drive-through patrons who account for 70 percent of the firm’s U.S. revenue. An on-demand Quarter Pounder takes about a minute longer to land in a customer’s hands than does the original sandwich, according to restaurant managers and analysts, even though fresh beef fries up faster than frozen patties. That’s because grilling begins only after a patron orders. Traditional Quarter Pounders were often cooked up in batches ahead of time. Every second counts in the fast-food business. McDonald’s drive-through speeds already lag those of some major competitors, according to one widely watched survey. McDonald’s does not share such data, but company representatives told  Reuters earlier this year that service times have slowed. Still, company executives are bullish on prospects for the popular Quarter Pounder, which accounts for about one-fourth of McDonald’s U.S. burger sales. At an investor conference last month, Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said the changeover has created fewer complications than expected and that restaurant operators are on board.  Some industry veterans, however, are skeptical. Richard Adams, a former Southern California McDonald’s franchisee-turned-consultant, says convenience is paramount for the chain’s patrons, who may go elsewhere if speed deteriorates.  “Any time the cooking process begins after the customer orders, the service time will be slower,” Adams said.  The fresh-beef initiative comes as pressure builds on McDonald’s kitchens.  Adams says restaurant crews already are juggling trickier menu items thanks to the recent national launch of McDonald’s new “Signature Crafted” sandwich line, which allows customers to pick their own meat, buns and toppings. “Signature Crafted” quarter-pound burgers also will use fresh beef as it becomes available nationwide. McDonald’s cooks could be further strained by the chain’s embrace of self-service kiosks and mobile ordering. The technology shaves ordering times, but can create new bottlenecks by swamping kitchens at peak hours, as companies such as Starbucks Corp have learned. The revamped Quarter Pounder is the latest move by Easterbrook to modernize the 60-year-old chain and reverse four straight years of traffic declines.  It’s also a direct shot at Wendy’s Co, Whataburger and In-N-Out. Those fresh-burger chains are among the fast-food rivals that McDonald’s says have siphoned 500 million U.S. transactions from its stores since 2012.  Easterbrook’s introduction of all-day breakfast in October 2015 was a big hit and has helped lift sales. The company’s stock price is up more than 25 percent so far this year.  Analysts expect the fresh-beef push, along with moves to ditch artificial ingredients in popular items such as chicken nuggets, to bolster sales by addressing consumer demand for simpler, “cleaner” and fresher ingredients. The Quarter Pounder makeover has won early support from analysts and McDonald’s franchisees in the heart of cattle country, where the product has been tested for almost two years in about 400 stores in Oklahoma and Texas. Three Dallas-area McDonald’s managers who spoke with Reuters estimated the switch has improved their Quarter Pounder sales from 20 percent to 50 percent, albeit aided by advertising and coupons.    “We’ve been stealing customers from a Whataburger down the street,” said Edgar Meza, a manager at a McDonald’s restaurant in an upscale neighborhood in north Dallas. Officials at Texas-based Whataburger, a regional chain, declined to comment. Some burger lovers are taking notice too. “They’re a little juicier,” said Bob Riley, who was polishing off a Quarter Pounder at an outlet near Dallas’ Deep Ellum neighborhood, his third McDonald’s meal of the week.  “I think Wendy’s woke them up,” he said. Joe Jasper, a former McDonald’s executive who owns 20 restaurants in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, has been deeply involved in the effort. He described the new Quarter Pounder as “the best burger in our industry, but more importantly, (one delivered) at the speed of McDonald’s.”  Trouble is, the “speed of McDonald’s” isn’t as fast as that of many of its competitors. The average service time at a McDonald’s drive-through last year was 208.2 seconds, according to a study published by QSR magazine, an industry publication, using data from SeeLevel HX, an Atlanta-based business intelligence firm. That’s well behind industry leader Wendy’s at 169.1 seconds, according to the survey. Burger King, Dunkin’ Donuts and KFC all beat McDonald’s too. McDonald’s narrowed the gap with Wendy’s by one-third from 2012 to 2016 by adding more drive-through lanes at some stores and by scrapping products such as “snack wraps,” tortilla-wrapped sandwiches that proved time-consuming to prepare. Still, its average drive-through service time last year was almost 20 seconds slower than it was in 2012, according to SeeLevel HX data.  [For a look at drive-through speeds, see tmsnrt.rs/2sLWMqW]      Claudia Barcenas, assistant manager at a McDonald’s off Dallas’ Central Expressway, says her counter and drive-through staff inform patrons that fresh-beef Quarter Pounders can be delayed, particularly if the sandwiches are ordered well-done.  “We have to explain that it takes a bit longer. Perhaps a minute,” Barcenas said. Whether that’s worth it for McDonald’s customers remains to be seen as the experiment goes nationwide. Juan Rodriguez waited on his lunch break for a fresh-beef Quarter Pounder at the drive-through of another Dallas McDonald’s outlet about nine miles from Barcenas’ store. At the three-minute mark, the 20-year-old was getting restless. “If it’s better, I don’t mind waiting,” Rodriguez said. “But if it tastes the same, then no.” ",6202017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-strategy-analysis/will-mcdonalds-customers-wait-for-the-new-quarter-pounder-idUSKBN19B0CG

The new deal, which goes until 2024, comes a week after longtime Olympics sponsor McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) bowed out of its sponsorship deal three years early, citing a change in the company’s priorities as it tries to hold down costs. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but IOC sources have previously told Reuters that major sponsors pay about $100 million per four-year cycle, which includes one summer and one winter games. The IOC has been looking to increase the cost of those deals, sources previously said. Intel joins about a dozen global Olympics sponsors such as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Samsung (005930.KS) and most recently, Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba (BABA.N) which signed on six months ago. The IOC has been trying to make the Olympics more technologically savvy and appeal to younger people through its internet-based TV network, the Olympic Channel. IOC President Thomas Bach and Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich said Intel’s sponsorship will open up new experiences for athletes, fans and spectators in emerging areas such as virtual reality. “We’ll allow people online to feel like they are there,” Krzanich said, speaking at a press conference in New York. Intel said it would provide 5G wireless technology, virtual reality, artificial intelligence platforms, and drones that could be used in aerial filming or light shows.  Intel’s business has undergone big changes in recent years. In March, it agreed to buy autonomous vehicle technology firm Mobileye MBLY.N for $15 billion in a bid to expand its reach beyond its core microprocessor business, which has faced declines along with the personal computer market. Intel may be seeking to expand its reach in Asia, which is preparing to host three consecutive Olympic Games. Pyeongchang in South Korea is staging the 2018 winter games, Tokyo the 2020 Summer Olympics and Beijing the 2022 Winter Olympics. The IOC is deciding between Paris and Los Angeles for the 2024 summer games. The IOC is looking to sign pricier deals while brands are trying to figure out whether exclusive Olympics sponsorship rights offer the marketing impact they once did. Some companies find it is much cheaper to work directly with athletes or specific countries than the IOC. Timo Lumme, managing director of IOC Television and Marketing Services, said in an interview that the IOC, with 13 top sponsors, has more partners than ever before, showing that brands see “tangible returns” from investing in the games. As for the tensions in the Korean Peninsula, Lumme said that the IOC is monitoring the situation daily to see if it could effect the 2018 games.  “We feel very sure and comfortable and that the Korean government will provide a safe environment for the world’s athletes to meet next February,” Lumme said.

Intel’s partnership with the IOC will focus on bringing its technology including virtual reality, artificial intelligence and drones to help enhance the Olympic Games, the IOC said in a statement. McDonald’s exited its 41-year Olympics sponsorship amid a push by the U.S. fast-food giant to focus on its core business as well as rising sponsorship costs and declining TV ratings.

1184,MCD,Not so fast: U.S. restaurant workers seek ban on surprise scheduling,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The text message came as Flavia Cabral walked to a McDonald’s restaurant in Manhattan for her 6 p.m. shift on a May evening. It was from her manager. Business was slow and she was not needed. Cabral said she was not too surprised. Her work hours fluctuate almost weekly, though losing an entire shift at the last minute happens only once every few months. This time the canceled shift took a $63 bite out of her average $350 gross weekly earnings from two part-time jobs. “Every week you’re guessing how much money you’re going to get and how many days you’re going to work,” said Cabral, 53, who has been employed at McDonald’s for four years. But a measure of relief is coming for Cabral and 65,000 other New York City fast-food workers whose schedules and incomes often change with little or no notice. New York recently became the largest U.S. city to require fast-food restaurants to schedule workers at least two weeks in advance, or pay them extra for changes. The law, which the restaurant industry vigorously opposed, also requires employers to allow 11-hour breaks between shifts, offer part-time staff additional work before hiring new employees, and pay retail workers to be “on call.” It takes effect late this year. McDonald’s Corp did not respond to a request for comment. Nationwide, the issue of scheduling is becoming a new battleground in the fight to boost living standards for low-paid workers, waged largely by the “Fight for $15” movement. The five-year-old, union-backed initiative has already helped convince many jurisdictions, including New York state, to raise minimum wages. In Oregon, a bill that would set regular scheduling for workers at large food service, hospitality and retail companies is awaiting the governor’s signature. Similar bills are pending in five other states. Not only do fluctuating schedules wreak havoc with tight household budgets, they make it difficult to make appointments, arrange child care and plan family time, workers point out. The restaurant industry vigorously opposed the New York City law. Combined with higher minimum wages, scheduling requirements will eventually cripple some fast-food outlets, which mostly operate on thin profit margins of 1.5 to 3 percent, it says. With a business model based on offering workers entry-level opportunities, not living wages, fast-food restaurants need flexible scheduling to survive, said industry advocate Louis Meyer, who runs fast-food operations at New Jersey-based Briad Group. “There’s no way you can stay in business,” said Meyer, whose company employs 1,000 workers at about two dozen franchised Wendy’s and TGI Friday’s in New York. “It’s like having a disease. It’s going to get you sooner or later.” Workers at McDonald’s, whose restaurants are mostly franchised, said weekly schedules are usually posted a day or two before they take effect. Still, they say they are often told at the last minute not to come to work or to punch out early. “You could only have been on the clock for two hours and they’ll tell you to go home,” said Ashley Bruce, 22, who has worked for four years at a McDonald’s on Chicago’s South Side. The Chicago City Council is considering a scheduling bill that would cover 450,000 hourly workers. Variable scheduling began cropping up in the 1970s as companies sought to maximize profits to better attract investors, according to University of Chicago Associate Professor Susan Lambert, who studies scheduling practices. “They’re really looking at those labor budgets,” she said. “So, that puts enormous pressure on managers to really keep close track of how many hours you’re using and how sales are going.” Some use sophisticated “workforce optimization systems” to analyze sales, weather and other factors to determine how few workers they need to remain profitable at a given moment, Lambert said. Although fluctuating schedules affect mostly lower paid workers, it is a management strategy that is starting to affect higher paid jobs as well, as companies seek to transfer the risk of unsteady revenue to their employees. The New York City scheduling law was passed with strong support from unions, including Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, even though almost all fast-food workers are not unionized. But Local 32BJ President Hector Figueroa said winning scheduling rights for fast-food workers also helps his union’s 90,000 building service workers. “Our members enjoy these rights under the contract,” he said. “But if other workers don’t enjoy them, it’s just a matter of time for an employer in a building or in a cleaning company to say, ‘Wait a minute, why do you guys need advance notice of scheduling?’”",7172017,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-fastfood-schedules/not-so-fast-u-s-restaurant-workers-seek-ban-on-surprise-scheduling-idUSL1N1K80U5

1188,MCD,"Custom burgers, $1 drinks boost McDonald's sales; shares jump","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) on Tuesday posted its biggest jump in global sales at established restaurants in five years, helped by stronger traffic worldwide and U.S. initiatives including drink specials and custom sandwiches. The world’s biggest fast-food chain by revenue has been working to reverse traffic declines at U.S. restaurants, its top profit generator, with new products and services like fresh beef Quarter Pounders, signature crafted sandwiches, mobile ordering and delivery. The moves are part of a broader turnaround plan under Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, now in its second year.  McDonald’s shares hit an all-time high and were a top gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday, and were last up 4 percent at $157.83.    The company appears to be winning back business lost to fast-food competitors like Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and Restaurant Brands International Inc’s Burger King (QSR.TO), which McDonald’s said in March had siphoned 500 million U.S. transactions away from the chain since 2012. The two rivals report earnings in August. “Our gain will result in pain being felt elsewhere,” Easterbrook said on a conference call to discuss the results.    McDonald’s has also focused on value for U.S. customers by selling soft drinks of all sizes for $1 and McCafe beverages, which include frappes, smoothies and espresso drinks, for $2. The new products and drink specials helped increase traffic and spending, with the sandwich launch persuading some lapsed customers to return and also bringing in new diners, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.    Global same-restaurant sales climbed 6.6 percent in the second quarter, helped by the strongest traffic in more than five years, beating the 4 percent growth estimated by analysts, the company said. Sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months rose 3.9 percent in the second quarter, topping the 3.2 percent increase expected by analysts, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.  Strong sales in China lifted comparable sales gains in McDonald’s high-growth segment to 7 percent, almost double the 3.6 percent increase expected by analysts. That contrasted with sluggish results from Yum China Holdings Inc (YUMC.N), the China operator of KFC and Pizza Hut that was spun off from Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N).   Net income rose to $1.40 billion, or $1.70 per share, from $1.09 billion, or $1.25 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, McDonald’s earned a profit of $1.73 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.62, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 3.4 percent to $6.05 billion, but topped analysts’ average estimate of $5.96 billion.

Shares of McDonald’s rose 3.8 percent, hitting an all-time high, after the fast-food giant posted the biggest rise in sales at established restaurants globally in five years. Caterpillar was up 5.1 percent, touching a more than five-year high, after the company raised its full-year outlook for the second time this year. “It looks like earnings are coming in better than expected and that’s giving the market a jump this morning,” said Ken Moraif, senior adviser at Money Matters, a wealth management and investment firm. However, Alphabet fell 3.1 percent, after the tech giant warned that expenses would remain high as more searches shift to mobile devices. The S&P; tech index has been the best performing sector this year, but there have been concerns about stretched valuations, putting earnings from big tech companies in the spotlight. Amazon and Facebook, part of the high-flying “FAANG” stocks, report results later this week, while Apple is due to report next week. “My concern is that it seems like these companies can do no wrong and when you have so much concentrated on such a small group, eventually these stock prices are going to become unrealistic,” Moraif said. “If the rest of the market isn’t there to support them, it could impact the sector in a big way.” Earnings are expected to have climbed 9.1 percent in the second quarter, compared with an 8 percent rise estimated at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 12:38 p.m. ET (1638 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 126.18 points, or 0.59 percent, at 21,639.35. The S&P; 500 was up 9.83 points, or 0.39 percent, at 2,479.74. It had hit a record high of 2,481.24. The Nasdaq Composite was up 4.40 points, or 0.07 percent, at 6,415.21. Seven of the 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, with the energy index’s 1.87 percent rise leading the gainers. The Fed kicks off a two-day meeting later in the day and while no rate hike is expected due to subdued inflation, the central bank’s statement on Wednesday will be parsed for clues on the pace of future rate hikes. DuPont was up 1.3 percent after beating estimates for profit and results. Eli Lilly was down 4.1 percent, while 3M fell 5.2 percent after reporting results.

U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts shops will offer a variety of local and national promotions, but will not aggressively discount the product that underpins the business, Nigel Travis, chief executive of Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O), said on Thursday. “You will not see us doing $1 coffee,” Travis said. “We think there are other ways of communicating value.” Dunkin’ Donuts promotions will include specials on breakfast food and offers for users of its loyalty card, he said.  McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) earlier this week said it was taking back sales lost to other fast-food chains with help from $1 and $2 specials on soft drinks, coffee, smoothies and espresso drinks. The comments from Travis came shortly after Dunkin’ Brands reported second-quarter profits that topped Wall Street’s view, even as traffic to its mainstay U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts cafes fell for the fifth quarter in a row.  That business accounts for more than 70 percent of the company’s total revenue. Second-quarter sales at U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts outlets open for more than a year, rose 0.8 percent, but missed analysts’ expectations for a gain of 1.3 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. Travis said results from the latest quarter were dampened by unseasonably cold weather in the Northeast, where it has a heavy concentration of stores.

1202,MCD,UPDATE 1-McDonald's bumps up estimate for stores in China by 2022,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp said it would almost double the number of stores in mainland China by 2022, slightly more than was expected, as part of its strategic partnership with state-backed conglomerate CITIC Ltd and Carlyle Group. Earlier in the year, the U.S fast food chain agreed to sell most of its China and Hong Kong business to CITIC and Carlyle for up to $2.1 billion. The new partnership had planned to add 1,500 restaurants in the two areas over the next five years.  But McDonald’s, which is betting the partnership will help it expand in the world’s No. 2 economy without using much of its own capital, said it expects to increase the number of stores in mainland China to 4,500 by the end of 2022, from 2,500 now. The company said it was targeting a double-digit annual sales growth in mainland China over the period, and was aiming to add 500 stores annually by 2022 versus 250 stores this year. “China will soon become our largest market outside of the United States. We are excited to join forces with CITIC and Carlyle for better localized decision-making to meet changing customer demands in this dynamic market,” Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s chief executive, said on Tuesday. Under the deal, which got regulatory approval last week, CITIC has 52 percent and Carlyle 28 percent of McDonald’s China and Hong Kong business.  The fast-food chain said it would aim to open more restaurants in lower-tier Chinese cities, boost delivery capacity and introduce a “digitalised and personalized” dining experience to more Chinese customers.

1205,MCD,McDonald’s boldly supersizes its China strategy,"HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - McDonald’s is going large in China. It will have to ensure that breakneck growth does not bring indigestion. On Tuesday, the $126 billion burger giant said it planned to open 2,000 mainland stores by 2022. That will nearly double its footprint from 2,500 outlets now. That target is up one-third from a previous goal of 1,500 restaurants in five years, a goal that also originally included Hong Kong. This underlines how the $2.1 billion sale of McDonald’s China business, which was agreed in January and closed last week, was not really a retreat. It now holds one-fifth of the business, which has the rights to run McDonald’s operations in China for 20 years, with the rest owned by Chinese conglomerate CITIC, CITIC’s private equity arm, and U.S. buyout firm Carlyle. Expanding makes sense. Bigger rival Yum China, which operates Pizza Hut and KFC, already has more than 7,000 restaurants and in the long term reckons it can get to 20,000. That shows how much growth potential remains for Western fast food, particularly in China’s less glamorous third- and fourth-tier cities. Still, the new pace could be challenging. McDonald’s has had since 1990 to open 2,500 restaurants. It will need to find lots of good locations fast, and hire huge numbers of staff. Maintaining food safety and quality control while scaling so quickly will be difficult, and will push suppliers to the limits, says Shaun Rein, founder of China Market Research Group. McDonald’s is, of course, highly attuned to this risk and says quality will not be compromised in any manner. It learnt the hard way how important this is: sales suffered after a Chinese television report in 2014 showed workers at a supplier using expired meat. And its new partners could help: Carlyle has experience expanding restaurant groups in China, and helped investee company Yashili, a baby-milk producer, improve its standards after the dairy sector was rocked by a lethal scandal. This is a supersized bet on China – but at least McDonald’s has partners to share in the risk.",8092017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonalds-china-breakingviews/mcdonalds-boldly-supersizes-its-china-strategy-idUSKBN1AP0AI

1207,MCD,McDonald's to cut global antibiotic use in chickens,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) on Wednesday said that it would begin curbing the use of the high value human antibiotics in its global chicken supply in 2018, as the fast-food giant joins a broad effort to battle dangerous superbugs. McDonald’s, in a policy statement, said it is working on antibiotic plans for other meats, dairy cows and laying hens. McDonald’s is requiring suppliers of chicken meat to begin phasing out the use of antibiotics defined by the World Health Organization as “highest priority critically important antimicrobials” (HPCIA) to human medicine. Public health and consumer groups applauded the move, which is not as strict as the company’s policy for the United States, where already for a year suppliers have provided the chain with chickens raised without antibiotics deemed important to human health. In January 2018, HPCIAs will be gone from McDonald’s chickens in Brazil, Canada, Japan, South Korea, the United States and Europe. Only in Europe the company will make an exception for Colistin, a last resort antibiotic. By the end of 2019, suppliers in Australia and Russia will stop using HPCIAs and European suppliers plan to remove Colistin.  Suppliers in all other markets will comply by January 2027. “Our goal is to have this policy implemented before this date,” McDonald’s said in its posted antibiotic policy update. McDonald’s told a group of consumer and environmental organizations on Aug. 17 that 74 percent of its global chicken sales will conform to this policy as of January 2018, Consumers Union, the policy division of Consumer Reports, said in a statement. Consumers Union also said the company told the group that it hopes to have a timeline soon for reducing medically important antibiotics from its beef supply.  McDonald’s declined comment on sales figures and its plans for beef. More than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for livestock use. Scientists have warned routine use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous antibiotic-resistant superbug infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health. “If fully implemented, (the plans) could be a total game changer that could transform the marketplace given the company’s massive buying power,” Jean Halloran, Consumers Union’s director of food policy initiatives, said in a statement.

1215,MCD,Investors renew push to get Sanderson Farms to cut antibiotic use,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Sanderson Farms Inc shareholders have filed another proposal aimed at convincing the third-largest U.S. poultry producer to stop giving medically important antibiotics to healthy chickens for disease prevention. Sanderson is the only large U.S. chicken producer that has not committed to curbing the use of those life-saving drugs. The new proposal from the non-profits As You Sow and Oxfam America will get a vote from investors at the company’s annual meeting in early 2018 if it is not successfully challenged by the company with regulators. More than 70 percent of medically important antibiotics in the United States are sold for use in farm animals. Scientists have warned that routine use of antibiotics in healthy chickens and other food animals contributes to the rise of dangerous antibiotic-resistant superbug infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health. A similar proposal at Sanderson Farms’ annual meeting in February this year failed with only around 30 percent backing of shareholder votes cast.  “We expect to see a majority vote this year,” said Austin Wilson, environmental health manager at As You Sow.      Sanderson Farms was not immediately available for comment. In the past Sanderson Farms has said that the preventative use of antibiotics in food animals has not been shown to harm human health. It also said that there was not sufficient demand from shareholders or consumers to change its antibiotics policy.  The company, which is a low-cost chicken producer, currently is running an advertisement that takes aim at food industry “marketing gimmicks” and touts its own use of “the facts” and “common sense”. Meanwhile, major chicken buyers including fast-food giant McDonald’s Corp are in various stages of switching to chicken raised without antibiotics important to human health.

1219,MCD,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Dollar stalls, stocks edge up with U.S. tax plan in focus","* McDonald’s shares boost Dow; Europe equities rise * Emerging stocks in worst losing streak since May 2016 * U.S. Q2 economic growth revised higher * Oil prices slip, pulling back from recent gains (Updates with U.S. afternoon trading) By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar slipped on Thursday after a recent rally and world stock markets inched higher as investors digested U.S. economic data and prospects for a U.S. tax reform plan proposed by President Donald Trump. Trump on Wednesday proposed the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in three decades, calling for tax cuts for most Americans, but prompting criticism that the plan favors business and the rich and could add trillions of dollars to the deficit. “In the U.S., for stocks at least, it is kind of a hangover from yesterday’s tax news, people still trying to digest that,” said William Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “From a bond perspective, it is still this idea that the Fed seems very insistent on looking past any sort of short-term data that we might get between now and December and raising rates,” Delwiche said. Bets that the Federal Reserve will raise rates once more by year-end have firmed this week, following comments from Chair Janet Yellen on Tuesday that the U.S. central bank needs to continue gradual rate hikes despite broad uncertainty about the path of inflation. Data on Thursday showed the U.S. economy grew a bit faster than previously estimated in the second quarter, but the momentum probably slowed in the third quarter, with activity curbed temporarily following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. On Wall Street, equity indexes were little changed after notching solid gains a day earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 44.93 points, or 0.2 percent, to 22,385.64, the S&P; 500 gained 2.72 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,509.76 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.35 points, or 0.05 percent, to 6,449.91. The Dow got a boost from McDonald’s shares, which rose 2.5 percent after an analyst upgrade. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.07 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.16 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.55 percent, their sixth straight session of declines. The dollar edged lower against a basket of currencies, on pace to snap a three-day winning streak, as investors looked to take profit on the greenback’s rally this week ahead of the end of the quarter. The dollar index fell 0.26 percent, with the euro up 0.37 percent to $1.1787. “We had a big move yesterday. For us to take some of that back makes sense,” said Brad Bechtel, managing director FX at Jefferies in New York. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.3157 percent, from 2.309 percent late on Wednesday. Oil prices slipped, backing off from earlier gains spurred by tension around northern Iraq following the Kurdistan region’s vote in favor of independence. U.S. crude fell 1.42 percent to $51.40 per barrel and Brent was last at $56.89, down 1.18 percent on the day. Spot gold added 0.4 percent to $1,286.40 an ounce.

1220,MCD,McDonald faces tough task to look good in M&S; fashion,"LONDON (Reuters) - Jill McDonald picks up something of a poisoned chalice when she starts as boss of clothing at Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) on Monday, with little room to maneuver as she tackles one of the biggest jobs in British retailing on her first foray into fashion. McDonald’s retail credentials are strong, but they were earned as CEO of bicycles to car parts company Halfords (HFD.L) and she will have to work within a blueprint set out by her new boss as she looks to deliver the sustained sales and profit growth that has eluded M&S; for a decade in competition with a burgeoning fast-fashion market. She will have to operate within the confines of the detailed strategy already set out by Chief Executive Steve Rowe, an M&S; lifer. She must also work under the chairmanship of Archie Norman, who joined M&S; this month and is known for turning around some of Britain’s biggest companies. To compound matters, Rowe and predecessor Marc Bolland have already used sourcing directors Mark and Neal Lindsey to boost profit margins by changing the way M&S; buys and makes clothes, taking away any easy gains for a new boss. “If you’re not given free rein to implement the strategy that you want, you’ve got one hand tied behind your back,” said a former M&S; director speaking on condition of anonymity. In its 1990s heyday M&S; was the go-to British high street destination for clothes, selling everything from party dresses to suits and underwear. In 1997 it became the first UK retailer to post profit of 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion). But while the 133-year-old group remains the Britain’s largest clothing retailer in sales terms, it has been squeezed by the likes of Inditex’s (ITX.MC) Zara, H&M; (HMb.ST) and Primark, owned by Associated British Foods (ABF.L). Profit was 614 million pounds in 2016-17. Rowe’s strategy is focused on reduced prices for entry-level ranges, cutting back on clearance sales and promotions while improving service. He also has a five-year program to close some stores and restructure others to reflect faster-growing online sales. Some analysts have questioned whether Rowe’s plans are sufficiently radical, but he told shareholders in July that he was convinced it is the right strategy. That makes it hard for McDonald. “Is she just coming in to execute that plan?,” the former director said. “Let’s say she wants to do something really quite radical that’s going to have a major impact on the bottom line. Rowe might say, ‘you can’t do that to me, I’m 18 months in ... I’ve given guidance to the City’.” McDonald will have overall profit and loss accountability for all aspects of M&S; non-food business, from design and sourcing through to the supply chain and logistics. She will work alongside Jo Jenkins, clothing and beauty director, and Queralt Ferrer, director of design.  Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at M&S; investor Royal London Asset Management, said McDonald could be under pressure to cut margins or increase prices after the Brexit-related slump in sterling, which is also weighing on consumer spending. “The challenge of boosting growth in M&S;’s clothing business will be no mean feat,” he said. Rowe maintains that the naysayers miss the point. He has highlighted McDonald’s “fantastic customer insight” and a bank of operational, retail and leadership experience developed at Halfords and fast-food giant McDonald’s (MCD.N). “Whether you’re buying bikes and bike pieces or dresses and dress pieces, there’s the same type of negotiation needed, the same level of detail needed in terms of sourcing and profit margins and relationships with suppliers,” said one person with knowledge of the appointment process. M&S; insiders also point to McDonald’s all-encompassing job title of managing director, a subtle difference from previous incumbents’ title of director of clothing and home. The suggestion is that the change means her role could include wider issues, such as the online service proposition that has lagged behind those of rivals. McDonald will, however, have to deal with a complex set of director relationships. Reporting to McDonald will be Jenkins, who has more than 25 years of fashion experience. She was passed over by Rowe for the top clothing job but may have to teach McDonald the clothing ropes.  Meanwhile, Chief Financial Officer Helen Weir will lose responsibilities for clothing, home and beauty supply chain and logistics, which she has handled since last year. There is also a danger that McDonald could be caught between Rowe and new chairman Norman, whose previous turnaround exploits include supermarket chain Asda and broadcaster ITV and who won’t shy away from tough decisions. “Archie’s pretty hands-on, asking questions and probing strategy. That can be quite a distraction,” said the former M&S; director. McDonald has given away little so far. “Whatever business I’ve worked in, the number one lesson — and I’ll take it forward to M&S; — is you have to stay as close as possible to your customers,” she told reporters. “It’s amazing how easy it is to slip off that path.” ",9282017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-m-s-moves/mcdonald-faces-tough-task-to-look-good-in-ms-fashion-idUSKCN1C31RJ
1221,MCD,McDonald's South Korea office raided in burger probe: reports,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean investigators raided the Seoul office of McDonald’s Corp on Wednesday following a series of complaints that  children fell ill after eating hamburger patties alleged to have been undercooked, Yonhap News Agency and other media said.

1224,MCD,"McDonald's sales strong as cheap drinks, new burgers lure back diners","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) reported strong restaurant sales on Tuesday, as $1 sodas and build-your-own burgers helped it draw in more customers and beat back rivals in an intense battle for market share.               The world’s largest restaurant chain by revenue has been working to boost flagging traffic at its U.S. restaurants, where it gets most of its profit, after customers defected to fast-food rivals and pricier fast-casual options like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N).  In the past year, McDonald’s has introduced cook-to-order, fresh beef Quarter Pounders and new items with a variety of buns and sauces like the Signature Sriracha sandwich, along with mobile ordering and delivery. “We served more customers, more often,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook said on a conference call to discuss third-quarter earnings. “The U.S. business regained its stride.”  Some analysts on the call expressed concern that new efforts, including table service and made-to-order burgers, would mean longer wait times that would annoy diners, but executives said customer satisfaction was higher and any service issues would be quickly ironed out.  Global sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 6 percent for the quarter, posting the third straight quarterly traffic increase and beating the 4.5 percent gain expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.  Those sales rose a better-than-expected 4.1 percent in the United States, where traffic improved for the second quarter in a row after more than four straight years of declines. China, the UK and Canada also turned in strong performances.  “Given that the fast food and casual dining segments as a whole struggled over the third quarter, this is an encouraging set of results which suggests McDonald’s is gaining both market and customer share,” GlobalData Retail’s Managing Director Neil Saunders said. McDonald’s shares were up 1 percent at $165 in midday trading, flirting with their record high on Friday.  Aggressive U.S. promotions included $1 any-size soft drinks, $2 McCafe smoothies and espresso drinks and McPick 2 offers of two items for $5. The changes, part of a turnaround plan under CEO Easterbrook, came as McDonald’s catches up with Chipotle, Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) and other chains that raised the bar for  what consumers can expect from quick-serve restaurants.  McDonald’s shares have climbed 65 percent since Easterbrook was named CEO in March 2015, well ahead of Wendy’s 37 percent gain and nearly triple the S&P; 500’s rise over the same period. Chipotle shares meanwhile have plunged 52 percent following a string of food safety lapses in 2015. McDonald’s shares may have more scope for gains, as the company’s price-to-earnings ratio is still far below many peers, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Many fast-casual chains have fallen short of expectations following a wave of initial public offerings in recent years. Shares in Zoe’s Kitchen Inc (ZOES.N) and Noodles & Co (NDLS.O) are trading below their IPO prices, while Shake Shack Inc (SHAK.N) is far below its record high of nearly $93 in May 2015.  Lower priced fast-food chains seem to be benefiting from last year’s sharp slowdown in customer traffic to fast-casual chains, Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a recent report. “I think it’s safe to say that the reports of fast food’s death were greatly exaggerated,” said Senatore, who added that fast-food chains have posted the best fundamental results and stock returns of the broader industry since late 2015.  During the call, analysts called out concerning trends in service times and U.S. labor costs.  Executives said service speeds initially slow slightly, roughly 5 seconds, at its modernized “experience of the future” restaurants that offer kiosk and mobile ordering, curbside pickup, table service, custom sandwiches and cook-to-order burgers.  “We expect to claw that back” as crews get more experienced, McDonald’s USA President Chris Kempczinski said. Every second counts in the fast-food business. Service times at McDonald’s drive-throughs, which account for 70 percent of U.S. revenue, already lag those of some major rivals. Excluding items, McDonald’s earned a profit of $1.76 per share, missing the average analyst estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. During the quarter, McDonald’s had higher taxes and expenses, but also had gains from selling its China and Hong Kong businesses. Total revenue fell 10 percent to $5.75 billion, due to restaurant sales to franchisees and strategic partners.

The firm will change its registered business name to “Golden Arches (China) Co Ltd”, a spokeswoman confirmed to Reuters on Thursday, adding though that its brand name in China - a transliteration of McDonald’s - would be unchanged. The shift comes after the chain agreed earlier in the year to sell most of its China and Hong Kong business to CITIC Ltd (0267.HK) and Carlyle Group (CG.O). The business plans to nearly double the number of its outlets in mainland China to 4,500 by 2022. “It will still be clearly ‘McDonald’s’ when diners come to our stores,” the chain said on its official China microblog. “Our restaurant name will remain the same, the change is only at business license level,” spokeswoman Regina Hui added in emailed comments to Reuters. She declined to comment further on the reason for the change. McDonald’s in China and Hong Kong is 52 percent owned by CITIC, while Carlyle has a 28 percent stake. McDonald’s itself retains a 20 percent interest in the business. The structure is aimed at improving sales at existing stores and expanding outlets. Fast-food firms including McDonald’s and rival Yum China’s (YUMC.N) KFC are bouncing back from a series of food-supply scandals in China that had dented performance.

1233,MCD,"Investor demand boosts Canada maple bond outlook, case for index inclusion","TORONTO (Reuters) - A jump in maple bond issuance this year is improving chances the instruments will be added to a key benchmark debt index, with more foreign companies expected to tap the Canadian dollar debt market as investor interest in diversifying holdings drives demand, some fund managers said. A slew of global companies, including Apple Inc, McDonald’s Corp and Walt Disney Co, have set the maple bond market on fire, with year-to-date issuance of C$15 billion ($11.6 billion), triple that of last year. The flurry of maple bonds - Canadian dollar-denominated debt issued by foreign companies - is helping money managers branch out from Canadian bank debt, which accounts for about 40 percent of the Canadian corporate bond index. “They’re strong, well-rated ... companies that give us good diversification from our domestic market,” said fund manager Bill Girard at 1832 Asset Management LP, which bought into Apple, McDonald’s and PepsiCo Inc maple bonds. Domestic investor demand for maple bonds also comes as Canadian banks shift some of their debt issuance to the United States and Europe.  Retaining the breadth of borrowers seen this year would boost maple market development, and sustained issuance could potentially get the bonds added to the FTSE TMX Universe Bond Index, the benchmark against which many bond funds in Canada are tracked. “That’s a topic that we would like to revisit if that becomes something that investors are seeking,” said Marina Mets, director of FTSE TMX. Mets said there is not currently a “mandate” for inclusion. Much of the issuance by foreign companies - most of which this year have been U.S. multinationals - has been in industries that are not available in the Canadian debt market, and blue-chip companies have been able to borrow substantial amounts of money at attractive rates.  Apple, like many issuers this year, benefited from favorable pricing in the swaps market, which facilitates exchanging the proceeds into U.S. dollars. At C$2.5 billion ($1.9 billion), Apple set a record for maple deals and the bonds have since performed well, adding to their appeal. Its spread over Canada’s equivalent government bond has narrowed to 75 basis points from 81.4 basis points at issue. “There is a supply-demand dynamic that didn’t exist before that enabled Apple, enabled Disney to price significant size transactions at a premium to where they could otherwise raise funding in their home market,” said Scott Lampard, head of global markets at HSBC Bank Canada, which has been a lead manager on a number of maple deals this year.

1234,MCD,CORRECTED-UPDATE 5-Starbucks cuts profit outlook as competitors close in," (This story corrects third paragraph to show that U.S. same-store sales up not down.) By Lisa Baertlein and Uday Sampath Kumar (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) trimmed its profit forecast and posted disappointing quarterly sales on Thursday, squeezed by competitors ranging from boutique coffee sellers like Intelligentsia and lower-price rivals including McDonald’s.   Investors used to Starbucks beating expectations and raising profit outlooks sent shares down 3.4 percent in extended trading. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma battered same-store sales at more than 1,100 cafes in the United States, which still accounts for the lion’s share of operating income. Sales at U.S. cafes were up 2 percent for the quarter that ended Oct. 1. Excluding the hurricane impacts, they would have been up 3 percent - still just short of analysts’ estimate.  During a conference call, executives also pegged the same-store sales weakness to slower service as workers juggled mobile ordering, complex menus and other issues as well as soft restaurant foot traffic. The Seattle-based coffee chain cut its long-term earnings target to growth of 12 percent or greater per share from its prior call for growth of 15 percent to 20 percent.  Fourth-quarter revenue missed Wall Street’s target after sales at established global cafes gained 2 percent, less than analysts’ average target of 3.2 percent, according to Consensus Metrix.  Starbucks, which is cutting costs, streamlining menus and selling or shuttering some businesses, also announced a deal to sell its Tazo tea brand to Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) for $384 million. Analysts have warned that the Seattle-based company is being “middled” by rising competition on the value and quality fronts and that it must bolster sales of higher-priced specialty drinks and breakfast sandwiches.  CEO Kevin Johnson told Reuters in an interview that there was no evidence Starbucks was being hit by competition. “We are not going to be squeezed in the middle,” he said. But on a conference call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw said, “With competitive pressures on the rise, we remain laser-focused on driving profitable share growth as we head into calendar 2018.” U.S. convenience stores and fast-food chains are improving quality and pricing aggressively.  McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) recently expanded its McCafe menu with new macchiatos and lattes and is selling small McCafe espresso drinks for $2. Elsewhere, Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) is offering special deals on breakfast sandwiches in its bid to win breakfast. At the same time, upscale craft coffee rivals like Nestle SA’s (NESN.S) Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia are opening more shops. In the last 12 months, Starbucks shares are up about 4 percent, while the S&P; 500 index is up more 20 percent. Its  stock has been trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.8, slightly above McDonald’s but about half that of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), according to Thomson Reuters data. Total net revenue decreased 0.2 percent to $5.70 billion, compared with analysts’ revenue target of $5.80 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company fell 1.6 percent to $788.5 million. Excluding items, it earned 55 cents per share, in line with Wall Street targets. Starbucks has been adding working hours at some U.S. stores to ease backups caused by a flood of mobile orders. Meanwhile, cities and states are boosting the minimum wage and a tightening labor market is forcing some chains to increase pay and benefits to recruit and retain workers. The company said results should get a bump from its pending $1.3 billion purchase of the remaining 50 percent of its East China business from joint venture partners. That deal will give Starbucks ownership in 1,300 cafes in the area that includes Shanghai. Same-store sales from China were up 8 percent in the latest quarter, but the broader China and Asia Pacific region posted a rise of 2 percent, versus expectations of 3.2 percent.

1235,MCD,McDonald's new 'dollar' menu to intensify price war in 2018,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp said on Monday it would introduce new menus with $1, $2 and $3 items in early January as restaurants battle to win U.S. customers who have come to expect deals on fast food. McDonald’s is in a price war with rivals ranging from Yum Brands Inc’s Taco Bell to Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc.  McDonald’s dropped its popular “Dollar Menu” in 2013 after franchisees groused that selling items like a double cheeseburger for $1 cut into profits. The replacement “Dollar Menu & More” had higher prices, but failed to draw more customers despite heavy marketing. The new dollar menus, set to debut on Jan. 4, include any size soft drinks and cheeseburgers for $1, small McCafe drinks and bacon McDoubles for $2 and Happy Meals and triple cheeseburgers for $3, McDonald’s said.  They will supplement McDonald’s current value offers such as McPick 2 where customers can pick two items from a list for $5 - including Big Macs, fish filets and 10-piece chicken nuggets.    All of the value menus are designed to protect franchisee margins, the company said.  “You always have to have value as part of the equation,” Chris Kempczinski, president of McDonald’s USA, said in an interview. McDonald’s executives in October said almost all of its U.S. operators support its ongoing turnaround plan that includes the new value menus. McDonald’s recent U.S. recovery has been driven largely by its value offers, said Bob Goldin, partner and co-founder of food industry strategy firm Pentallect Inc. “They are really killing it with dollar beverages and the McPick 2,” said Goldin, who added that value remains a key driver of traffic to fast-food restaurants — even as the economy improves and diners have more disposable income.  Elsewhere, Taco Bell regularly rotates the roughly 20 items on its $1 value menu. Subway, which made a huge splash a few years ago with its “$5 foot-long” special, is now offering a variety of six-inch sandwiches for $2.99 each.  Dunkin’ Donuts also is brewing up more value offers after franchisees warmed to the idea of using deals in their fight to win breakfast. The strategy is not without risks, said Goldin, who noted that rising food and labor costs could squeeze franchisees who bear the brunt of such cost increases. “They are really stuck in a value trap,” Goldin said. “There is going to be tremendous pressure to raise prices.” ",12042017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mcdonald-s-value/mcdonalds-new-dollar-menu-to-intensify-price-war-in-2018-idUSKBN1DY2PP

1240,MCD,Fitch Affirms McDonald's at 'BBB'/'F2'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of McDonald's Corporation (McDonald's) at 'BBB/F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. At Sept. 30, 2017, McDonald's had $28.6 billion of debt. A full list of ratings is provided at the end of this release. McDonald's ratings balance its shareholder-friendly financial strategy with its substantial cash flow, significant scale, improved comparable sales (comps), and Fitch's view that the company will maintain total adjusted debt/EBITDAR in the mid-to-high 3.0x range while generating FCF of about $1 billion or more annually. McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain based on over $90 billion of systemwide sales generating positive comps during 16 of the past 20 years. During 2017-2019, McDonald's plans to use FCF, proceeds from refranchising and debt to return $22 billion-$24 billion of cash to shareholders. McDonald's returned $30 billion to shareholders during the three years ended 2016. KEY RATING DRIVERS Broad-based Comp Improvement:  McDonald's global comps are up 5.6% for the nine-month period ended Sept. 30, 2017, after rising 3.8% in 2016, and 1.6% in 2015 with all segments contributing. Comps in the U.S., McDonald's largest market, are up 3.3% for the latest nine-months, after rising 1.7% in 2016, and 0.5% in 2015. Growth is due to higher average check and improved guest counts. Average check is benefiting from price increases and positive mix as McDonald's strategically manages U.S. pricing relative to the ""food away from home"" consumer price index and sells more premium-priced products like Signature Crafted sandwiches and Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Tenders. Global guest counts are up 2.1% for the nine-months, after being relatively flat to down for four consecutive years. Fitch projects global comps will be approximately 5% in 2017 and 3% thereafter with the U.S. performing at the high end of Fitch's 2%-3% 2018 comp forecast for the U.S. restaurant industry. Of McDonald's four business segments, each contributed to 2016 revenue and operating income as follows: the U.S. (34%, 49%), International Lead Markets (29%, 37%), High Growth Markets (25%, 14%), and Foundational Markets & Corporate (12%, 1%). Sales trends are being supported by a more effective streamlined menu strategy, which includes premium items such as Signature Crafted sandwiches and value offerings like McPick 2, and the company's Velocity Growth Plan. The plan involves the system's Experience of the Future (EOF) restaurant modernization initiative and enhanced convenience provided by increased digital capabilities and delivery, which Fitch believes will improve McDonald's brand image by helping the chain remain relevant with consumers. Fitch expects McDonald's plan to offer mobile order-and-pay with curbside pickup in all U.S. restaurants by the end of 2017 and the roll-out of fresh beef quarter- pound burgers and a national $1, $2, $3 value platform in the U.S. during the first half of 2018 (1H18) to support near-term growth. Stabilizing U.S. Market Share: The U.S. is McDonald's largest market, representing 34% of its $24.6 billion of corporate revenue, 49% of its $7.7 billion of reported operating income, and 38% of its 36,899 systemwide units in 2016.  McDonald's guest counts in the U.S. declined 2%-4% annually from 2013-2015 but trends began to recover in 2016 and reversed in 2017 with two consecutive quarters of positive guest-count growth. Moreover, for the past three quarters, McDonald's has reported a favorable comp sales gap of approximately 2%-4% relative to quick-service sandwich competitors. Fitch believes McDonald's scale in the U.S. and consumers' desire for convenience could help limit further wholesale share losses.. However, Fitch attributes the recent improvement in the company's share trends to initiatives McDonald's has taken since the fall of 2015. These initiatives include the launch of all-day breakfast, menu strategies that focus on core equities such as the limited time offering of a Grand Mac and Mac Jr. sandwich, remodelling associated with the company's EOF initiative, and a renewed focus on value. Shareholder-Friendly Financial Strategy: McDonald's plans to return $22 billion-$24 billion of cash to shareholders from 2017-2019, after returning $30 billion from 2014-2016. Fitch projects McDonald's will generate nearly $15 billion of FCF before dividends, receive over $3 billion of proceeds from refranchising, and incur up to $6 billion of incremental debt from 2017-2019 to fund its cash return target, assuming annual EBITDA of approximately $10 billion-$10.5 billion. Total debt is projected to increase to around $32 billion by the end of 2019, after rising to $28.6 at Sept. 30, 2017 from $15 billion at the end of 2014. Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR is projected to approximate 3.7x-3.8x through 2019. Strategic Franchising Initiative: Following the sale of an 80% majority stake in its China and Hong Kong markets on July 31, 2017, McDonald's completed its goal of refranchising 4,000 company-owned restaurants a full year ahead of plan. At Sept. 30, 2017, 91% of McDonald's 36,976 stores were franchised, versus the company's historical franchise/company-owned mix of 80%/20%. McDonald's intends to continue optimizing its ownership mix with the goal of moving to 95% franchised longer term. Fitch expects high-margin franchise royalty and contractual rent payments to represent more than 50% of McDonald's revenue by 2018, up from 34% at the end of 2014.  Moreover, assuming franchise margin and company-operated margin stay near 3Q17 levels of 83% and 19%, respectively, franchising could comprise more than 80% of McDonald's restaurant margin dollars (before selling, general and administrative expenses) and cash flow by 2019. EBIT Growth Despite Refranchising:  The net operating income impact of refranchising is typically negative because companies swap a higher base of operating income from managing restaurants for a lower but more stable base of sales-based royalties and contractual rent payments. However, given strong comps and meaningful cost reductions, McDonald's consolidated operating income excluding the impact of currency rose 10% during the nine months, after increasing 11% in 2016. The company is on track with its original goal of reducing general and administrative (G&A;) expenses by $500 million by the end of 2018 and expects to generate an additional 5%-10% or $100 million-$300 million reduction by 2019. DERIVATION SUMMARY McDonald's 'BBB'/'F2' ratings balance its shareholder-friendly financial strategy with its substantial cash flow, significant scale and Fitch's view that total adjusted debt/EBITDAR will stay in the mid-to-high 3.0x range and FCF at about $1 billion or more annually. The company's rating is lower than that of Starbucks Corp. (A-/F2), the global leader in coffee, which is expected to maintain total adjusted debt/EBITDAR in the mid-2.0x range over the intermediate term. Starbucks is smaller than McDonald's in terms of systemwide sales and store count but also generates more than $1 billion of FCF annually. Starbucks mix of company-operated-to-licensed stores is roughly 50/50 with license partners being prominent retailers,, unlike traditional restaurant competitors such as McDonald's which plans to move toward 95% franchised over the longer term. Quick-service competitor YUM! Brands, Inc., for which Fitch provides a credit opinion, is larger than McDonald's in terms of units with over 44,000 locations across three brands including KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell which are 95% franchised. Restaurant Brands International, Inc., for which Fitch also has a credit opinion, is smaller than McDonald's with nearly 24,000 units that are 100% franchised across the Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen brands. Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR for YUM and Restaurant Brands has generally been in the 5x-6x range. Fitch anticipates that each of these chains can grow global comps in the 2%-3% range over time. McDonald's rating is in line with Darden Restaurants, Inc. (BBB/Stable), which has meaningfully lower lease-adjusted leverage in the mid-2.0x range due to McDonald's significantly larger scale, greater cash flow generation, and lack of exposure to the casual dining segment, which is more economically sensitive and in a secular decline. McDonald's ratings are also higher than Brinker International, Inc. (BB+/Negative) which has total adjusted debt/EBITDAR around 4.0x and operates in casual dining. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: -Revenue declines to about $20 billion by the end 2018 from roughly $27 billion at the end of 2014 due to refranchising and begins to grow at about 3%-4% thereafter; -Global comps of 5% in 2017 and 3% thereafter due to higher average check and flat to slightly positive guest counts (U.S. comps are expected to grow at least in line with the industry at 2%-3%); -Operating margin increases to the mid-40% range by 2019 from 32% in 2016 excluding non-cash stock option expense and before equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates; -EBITDA approximates $10.1 billion in 2017 and $10.2 billion in 2018, increasing to about $10.6 billion in 2019 due to systemwide sales growth in the 3%-5% range and G&A; cost reductions; -Total debt increases to about $32 billion by 2019 from $26.4 billion at the end of 2016; -Annual FCF approximates $1 billion in 2017 and rises above $2 billion by 2019 as EBITDA grows and capex declines from $1.7 billion in 2017 to $1.2 billion by 2020; -Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR approximates 3.7x-3.8x through 2019. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action -Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR sustained in the low-3x range; -Global comps consistently above the 2%-3% range along with the maintenance of market share in the U.S. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action -Total adjusted debt-to-operating EBITDAR near 4x due to material declines in operating income or higher than expected debt; -Negative global comps and loss of market share in the U.S. LIQUIDITY Ample Liquidity, Laddered Maturities:  At Sept. 30, 2017, liquidity totalled $5.2 billion and consisted of $2.7 billion of cash and full availability on its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility that expires December 2019. McDonald's did not have any CP outstanding at Sept. 30, 2017. Significant upcoming maturities over the next three years are approximately $1.8 billion in 2018, $2 billion in 2019, excluding the $2.5 billion line of credit that expires in 2019, and $2.5 billion in 2020. Fitch expects maturities to be refinanced, as debt paydown is not anticipated. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed McDonald's ratings as follows: McDonald's Corporation - Long-Term IDR at 'BBB'; - Bank credit facilities at 'BBB'; - Senior unsecured debt at 'BBB'; - Short-Term IDR at 'F2'; - Commercial paper at 'F2'.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

1241,MCD,U.S. labor board overturns Obama-era 'joint employment' ruling,"(Reuters) - A U.S. labor board on Thursday overturned an Obama-era ruling that had made it easier for unions and workers to hold companies accountable for practices of contractors and franchisees, a decision welcomed by business groups that could affect a major case against McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N). The 3-2 decision by the National Labor Relations Board reversed the standard it had set in a 2015 case involving Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. It reinstated a previous test that says companies are “joint employers” only when they exercise direct control over workers. President Donald Trump appointed two Republicans to the five-member NLRB earlier this year, giving his party a 3-2 majority for the first time in a decade. Trump’s appointees, who joined the board in August and September, are widely expected to revisit a series of recent NLRB decisions that business groups say unfairly favored unions. Thursday’s decision marked the third time this week the board overruled an Obama era decision.  Use of franchising or contract labor allows many companies to avoid the costs and responsibilities of directly employing workers. But a company found to be a joint employer can be required to bargain with unions and may be held liable for labor law violations by contractors, staffing agencies or franchisees. Prior to the 2015 ruling in Browning-Ferris, companies were found to be joint employers of workers hired by another business if they had “direct and immediate” control over working conditions.  In the Browning-Ferris decision, the NLRB said joint employment could also exist when companies have only “indirect or unexercised control” over workers.  On Thursday, the board said the Democratic majority in Browning-Ferris overstepped its authority by altering the legal definitions of employment. The two Democrats on the board dissented, saying the Browning-Ferris decision was legally sound and the majority failed to provide any “real-world examples or even remotely plausible hypotheticals” that show how the standard harmed businesses. In a separate case, the NLRB has filed complaints against McDonald’s claiming it was the joint employer of franchise workers across the country. A trial began over 2-1/2 years ago, but Thursday’s decision could derail the bulk of the case. The McDonald’s case had been seen as an important test of how Browning-Ferris, which did not mention franchisors, would apply to those companies. “At the very least, this significantly narrows the issues and it should be very comforting to McDonald’s and the franchise community,” said Michael Lotito, a partner at labor law firm Littler Mendelson who represents employers.  A lawyer representing McDonald’s in the case did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but two restaurant trade groups hailed the ruling. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation and other trade groups also applauded the decision, which came in a case involving two construction companies based in Iowa and Illinois. The board said the companies were joint employers of several workers who were unlawfully fired for going on strike. The International Franchise Association and National Restaurant Association, which represent McDonald’s and other fast-food restaurant operators, have been especially vocal critics of the Browning-Ferris standard, arguing it could doom the franchising industry. The restaurant association said in a statement that Thursday’s decision “restores years of established law and brings back clarity for restaurants and small businesses across the country.” ",12152017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-labor-jointemployers/u-s-labor-board-overturns-obama-era-joint-employment-ruling-idUSKBN1E838B

1243,MCD,"McDonald's sets recycling goals for packaging, restaurants","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp said on Tuesday it is responding to customers’ No. 1 request by setting goals for switching to environmentally friendly packaging materials and offering  recycling in all of its restaurants. “We have a responsibility to use our scale for good to make changes that will have a meaningful impact across the globe,” said Francesca DeBiase, McDonald’s chief supply chain and sustainability officer. The world’s biggest restaurant chain will aim to get 100 percent of its packaging from renewable, recycled or certified sources by 2025, with a preference for Forest Stewardship Council certification, which ensures that products come from responsibly managed forests.    Currently, half of McDonald’s customer packaging comes from renewable, recycled or certified sources, and 64 percent of fiber-based packaging comes from certified or recycled sources.  The company will also make recycling available in all of its restaurants by 2025, up from around 10 percent today. Last week, McDonald’s said it would eliminate foam packaging from its global supply chain by the end of this year. Recycling infrastructure, regulations and consumer behaviors vary city to city and country to country around the world, said DeBiase. She said that McDonald’s will work with industry experts, local governments and environmental groups to improve packaging designs, create new recycling programs, set progress benchmarks and educate its employees and customers.    “These goals have the potential to be transformational because no other restaurant has the scope and global supply chain of McDonald’s,” said Tom Murray, vice president of corporate partnerships at the Environmental Defense Fund, which is one of McDonald’s partners on the waste reduction and recycling initiative. Such efforts are good for the environment and for the bottom line, said Murray. “When McDonald’s began their waste reduction efforts nearly 30 years ago, the business and environmental benefits were immediate: the company saved an estimated $6 million a year.”  McDonald’s also has used its large size and global reach to fight the rise of dangerous, antibiotic-resistant bacteria known as “superbugs”. Scientists and public health experts warn that using medically important antibiotics to prevent disease and speed up growth in healthy animals fuels the development of those potentially deadly bacteria. In 2015, McDonald’s was the first global fast-food chain to commit to eliminating the use of those drugs from its U.S. chicken supply chain, a move that prompted most of its rivals and most major chicken suppliers to follow suit.

1245,MCD,UPDATE 1-McDonald's 'joint employment' trial delayed amid settlement talks,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp and a U.S. labor board are in talks to settle a case claiming the fast food company is liable for purported labor law violations by its franchisees, leading a judge on Friday to pause a trial that began in 2015. Administrative Law Judge Lauren Esposito in Manhattan said that even though the trial is expected to wrap up as soon as next week, McDonald’s, its franchisees, and the National Labor Relations Board’s general counsel should have a chance to pursue a settlement. The office of General Counsel Peter Robb, appointed by President Donald Trump and took office in November, requested the stay on Wednesday. The general counsel said a board decision released last month in a separate case that narrowed the definition of “joint employment” may have wiped out some of the claims against McDonald’s.  The McDonald’s case had been seen as a test of when franchisors may be considered joint employers and required to bargain with unions or be held accountable for franchisees’ labor practices. Business groups have said that treating franchisors as employers could upend the franchise model.  McDonald’s spokeswoman Terri Hickey on Friday said “McDonald’s USA is simply not a joint employer with its franchisees, and we are hopeful that this development will lead to a long overdue and successful resolution of the pending cases. The NLRB declined to comment.  Robert Brody, a lawyer for McDonald’s franchisees in New York, said the decision made sense after the recent NLRB ruling revising the definition of joint employment. The Service Employees International Union had urged Esposito not to pause the trial. SEIU said settlement talks could proceed after the trial ended. Adriana Alvarez, a McDonald’s employee in Chicago and an organizer with SEIU affiliate Fight for $15, said in a statement that McDonald’s had illegally harassed and fired workers who pushed for higher wages. She said pausing the trial amounted to “a get-out-of-jail-free card” for the company. The union and some McDonald’s workers filed a series of complaints with the NLRB beginning in 2012. In 2014, the general counsel issued a complaint that said McDonald’s controlled working conditions at franchises, including through corporate policies and scheduling software. McDonald’s also helped franchise owners respond to nationwide protests calling for fast food companies to pay higher wages, the general counsel said.

1248,MCD,"Advocacy group calls on McDonald's to remove antibiotics from beef, pork","(Reuters) - A consumer and public health group is pressing McDonald’s Corp to set a timeline for phasing out the routine use of medically important antibiotics in the beef and pork it serves, amid warnings that the practice fuels dangerous drug-resistant superbug infections in people. The petition drive by U.S. PIRG Education Fund is the latest in a broad campaign from the World Health Organization (WHO), investors, advocacy groups, and even nuns, to pressure farmers to curb or eliminate the use of those life-saving drugs on food animals. In the United States, an estimated 70 percent of antibiotics that are important to fighting human infections and ensuring the safety of invasive procedures such as surgeries are sold for use on farms.      Scientists warn that the use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous antibiotic-resistant superbug infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health.   As the world’s biggest hamburger chain and a significant buyer of pork for its bacon and McRib sandwiches, McDonald’s has an outsize influence on farm practices.  “The Big Mac can make a big dent in stopping the misuse of antibiotics in our food system,” said Matthew Wellington, antibiotics program director for U.S. PIRG.  McDonald’s in 2016 was the first major fast-food chain to shift its U.S. chicken supply to birds raised without medically important antibiotics, its effort spurred most of its rivals and major chicken suppliers to follow.  McDonald’s in August said would begin curbing the use of high-value human antibiotics in its global chicken supply in 2018 and begin working on antibiotic plans for other meats, dairy cows and laying hens. The company was not immediately available after normal business hours for comment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently said sales and distribution of medically important antibiotics for food production fell 14 percent from 2015 to 2016, the first decline in year-to-year sales since the agency began collecting the data in 2009.  FDA said chicken accounted for 6 percent of medically important antibiotic sales, while swine and cattle came in at 37 percent and 43 percent, respectively.

In the United States, an estimated 70 percent of antibiotics that are important to fighting human infections and ensuring the safety of invasive procedures such as surgeries are sold for use on farms.      Scientists warn that the use of antibiotics to promote growth and prevent illness in healthy farms animals contributes to the rise of dangerous antibiotic-resistant superbug infections, which kill at least 23,000 Americans each year and pose a significant threat to global health.   As the world’s biggest hamburger chain and a significant buyer of pork for its bacon and McRib sandwiches, McDonald’s has an outsize influence on farm practices.  “The Big Mac can make a big dent in stopping the misuse of antibiotics in our food system,” said Matthew Wellington, antibiotics program director for U.S. PIRG.  McDonald’s in 2016 was the first major fast-food chain to shift its U.S. chicken supply to birds raised without medically important antibiotics, its effort spurred most of its rivals and major chicken suppliers to follow.  McDonald’s in August said would begin curbing the use of high-value human antibiotics in its global chicken supply in 2018 and begin working on antibiotic plans for other meats, dairy cows and laying hens. The company was not immediately available after normal business hours for comment. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently said sales and distribution of medically important antibiotics for food production fell 14 percent from 2015 to 2016, the first decline in year-to-year sales since the agency began collecting the data in 2009.  FDA said chicken accounted for 6 percent of medically important antibiotic sales, while swine and cattle came in at 37 percent and 43 percent, respectively.

1250,MCD,"McDonald's robust U.S. sales fail to impress, shares fall","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) on Tuesday reported robust U.S. fourth-quarter restaurant sales, boosted by new buttermilk chicken tenders and low-price food, but that was not enough to match Wall Street’s increasing appetite for growth. Investor expectations are high three years into a turnaround led by Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook. Under his guidance, the company is recapturing share from rivals and winning back customers who had defected to direct competitors and fast-casual chains like Panera Bread and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N). Shares in the world’s biggest restaurant chain fell as much as 2.6 percent to $173.14 on Tuesday. The stock has jumped 80 percent since Easterbrook was named CEO on March 1, 2015, outperforming a 36 percent rise in the S&P; 500.   McDonald’s is now doubled down on discounting, piling more pricing pressure on rivals with a $1, $2, $3 value menu launched earlier this month.  It is  preparing for tough battles as U.S. restaurants fight for a bigger share of a pie that is not growing. “Value is where the street fighting really hits,” Easterbrook said on a conference call with analysts. McDonald’s also plans to invest $2.4 billion this year to help open 1,000 new restaurants and renovate and modernize existing units to accommodate self-service kiosks, mobile ordering and delivery. Executives said the company, which will see its effective tax rate drop due to the new U.S. tax law, is putting business investments before large share repurchases, comments that also  contributed to Tuesday’s share declines.   “The first priority is clearly to invest in the business for growth and then we’ll consider dividends and share buyback,” Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan said.  Sales at U.S. restaurants open at least 13 months jumped an enviable 4.5 percent, the fourth straight quarterly rise, but  only matched analysts’ estimates. Sales in the region were boosted by higher demand for its McPick 2 $5 combo offer and cheap drinks. The United States is McDonald’s biggest market by restaurants, revenue and operating income. Global same-store sales rose 5.5 percent, as it served more customers in regions including Canada, the United Kingdom and China. That exceeded the 5 percent gain analysts expected, “though a bit more modestly than in previous quarters,” Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said in a client note.  Net income fell 41.5 percent to $698.7 million or 87 cents per share, mainly due to a $700 million one-time net charge related to the new U.S. tax law. Excluding items, the company earned $1.71 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.59, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. After crunching the numbers to account for the tax charge and a lower-than-expected effective rate in the fourth quarter, Cowen & Co analyst Andrew Charles said in a client note that he viewed the underlying earnings per share as in-line with expectations.  Revenue fell 11.4 percent to $5.3 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31 as McDonald’s stepped up sales of restaurants to franchisees and strategic partners.

1255,MCD,"UPDATE 1-Wall Street says Starbucks has too many stores, prices too high","(Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) has too many stores and its prices are too high, Wall Street analysts are starting to agree, as they seek to explain the company’s cooling U.S. growth.  The Seattle-based chain now has more U.S. locations than McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) but it has been struggling for more than a year to lure the traffic needed to deliver the robust growth investors expect. Executives last week warned that 2018 same-store sales growth would be at the low end of its forecast. Starbucks  reported a 2 percent U.S. quarterly same-store sales gain that fell short of expectations on flat holiday traffic. Two years ago, those sales jumped 9 percent. Starbucks has offered a laundry list of reasons for the deceleration in its domestic business, including weak retail traffic, changes to its rewards program, bottlenecks from a crush of mobile orders, and holiday merchandise and drink specials that failed to “resonate” with customers. Executives concede that Starbucks’ U.S. afternoon business has dragged down results in its most important market.  Still, they say that Starbucks - which had 14,163 U.S. locations at year-end, 25 percent more than five years ago and 127 more than McDonald’s - is not cannibalizing its own sales or  losing share in a market crowded with coffee sellers ranging from independent cafes to fast-food chains and convenience stores. Analysts disagree. After a recent analysis of restaurant industry trends, retail traffic and other factors, Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore solidified her view that “excess unit growth, at a time when Starbucks is reaching a more mature stage of growth, is the root cause” of the company’s domestic woes. “Rather than a litany of excuses, we believe this is best explained by overcapacity in the industry,” said John Zolidis, president of Quo Vadis Capital, a Paris-based boutique research firm. “Starbucks is contributing to the problem by opening new units.” Credit Suisse analyst Jason West said the brew of stepped-up competition combined with Starbucks’ recent opening of roughly 700 U.S. stores a year, weighs on its “ability to re-accelerate growth.” Starbucks said on Friday its new cafes perform well and bring more business to all nearby coffee shops, not just its own. Proliferation of stores is not Starbucks’ only problem, according to analysts. Zolidis also sees another troubling sign: “We believe the company has raised prices too much.”  Starbucks on average is increasing prices 1 to 2 percent on an annual basis, while offering discounts through its rewards program, spokesman Reggie Borges said.    Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson, who tracks coffee prices in 10 markets in the U.S. Northeast, including New York, Boston and Washington, said that McDonald’s - now selling $1 coffee and $2 small espresso drinks - has kept prices mostly flat for the last two years. Anderson said that Dunkin’ Donuts, owned by Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O),  has raised prices by roughly 1 percent per year, while Starbucks has increased prices by about 3.5 percent each year. The analyst added that the rivals may be peeling off some of Starbucks’ less-affluent customers.

1256,MCD,Case to Watch: Business groups oppose ostensible agency in McDonald’s wage case,"National business groups have told a federal appeals court that the fact that workers at McDonald’s Corp California franchises believed the fast food giant was their employer should not make the company liable for wage-and-hour violations at those franchises. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the International Franchise Association filed amicus briefs late last month in a case that will give the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals its first chance to rule on whether companies can be held liable for violations of California’s labor code as a result of workers’ perceptions about who they work for under the “ostensible agency” doctrine.

1257,MCD,UPDATE 2-Strong Burger King sales boost Restaurant Brands' profit,"(Reuters) - Restaurant Brands International Inc’s quarterly profit topped analysts’ estimates, helped by strong sales of Burger King’s cheaper-priced menu items and popular Whoppers, sending the company’s shares up more than 8 percent on Monday. Ontario-based Restaurant Brands said comparable sales at Burger King rose 4.6 percent in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts on average had expected growth of 2.5 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. Restaurant Brands, which also owns coffee chain Tim Hortons, and other food-chain owners such as McDonald’s Corp, Yum Brands Inc and Dunkin’ Donuts Group Inc have been trying to attract diners with cheaper-priced meals and more breakfast and coffee items in a highly competitive market. Restaurant Brands has also introduced mobile applications and online ordering to attract more millennials to Tim Hortons and Burger King. “The digital channel has been and will continue to be a key focus of ours as we grow the Tim’s brand,” Chief Executive Daniel Schwartz said on a call with analysts. Comparable sales growth at Tim Hortons was 0.1 percent, well short of analysts average estimate of 1.2 percent growth, according to Consensus Metrix. Tim Hortons has been dealing with the fallout of bad publicity from its reaction to minimum wage increases in the country. Many Tim Hortons franchises cut back on employee perks and benefits when Ontario raised minimum wages by 21 percent to C$14. “It’s our primary objective, together with our franchise partners around the world, to drive sales growth in order to offset any cost inflation that we may face from year-to-year,” Schwartz said in response to an analyst’s question. He did not give any other details. Restaurant Brands, which also owns the Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen restaurant chain, said total revenue climbed 11 percent to $1.23 billion in the quarter. Restaurant Brands said net profit attributable to shareholders more than tripled to $395 million, or $1.59 per share. Excluding one-time items, it earned 66 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 57 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s shares hit a high of C$76.96, before easing to trade up 6.3 percent at C$75.56 in late morning trading.

1258,MCD,McDonald's plays 'hide the cheeseburger' in new Happy Meal health push,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp is removing cheeseburgers from U.S. Happy Meal menus and shrinking the french fry serving in one “Mighty Meal” as part of a new global plan to cut calories and make its food for children more healthy. The changes announced Thursday come as the world’s biggest fast-food chain for the first time established global limits for calories, sodium, saturated fat and added sugar in Happy Meals, which consultants and franchisees say account for roughly 15 percent of sales in the United States. By 2022, McDonald’s aims to have at least half of the Happy Meals listed on its drive-thru, restaurant and digital menus around the world contain 600 calories or less, 10 percent of calories from saturated fat, 650 mg of sodium, and 10 percent of calories from added sugar.  The chain’s U.S. restaurants will continue to offer Happy Meal cheeseburgers on request, which nudges diners to change behavior. When it did the same thing with Happy Meal sodas in 2013, some customers switched to water, milk or juice. McDonald’s said it will reduce calories and sodium from its six-piece chicken McNugget Mighty meal for older children by halving the french fry portion size.    The company also is adding bottled water to Happy Meal menu boards and offering chocolate milk on request as it is reformulated to reduce added sugars.  Currently, 28 percent of Happy Meal combinations offered on menu boards in 20 of McDonald’s major markets meet the new criteria. In June 2018, McDonald’s USA will hit the new calorie, sugar and fat goals and be 78 percent compliant on sodium.  As part of its continued partnership with the non-profit Alliance for Healthier Generation, McDonald’s also is working on plans to incorporate more healthy Happy Meal options for entrees as well as fruit and vegetable sides. Among other things, restaurants in Italy offer a Happy Meal grilled chicken sandwich; pineapple spears are on the menu in Spain; and cooked corn is a vegetable option in China, Japan and Taiwan.

Starbucks for the first time in 2017 had more U.S. outlets than McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N). The world’s biggest coffee chain reached that milestone as competition from high- and low-end rivals mounted, and its own cooling traffic trends sparked worries that it was opening too many stores.

1263,MCD,"McDonald's flips to fresh beef in 3,500 U.S. restaurants","OAK BROOK, Ill. (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp said on Tuesday that it had begun serving fresh beef Quarter Pounders and other premium burgers at about 3,500 restaurants in the United States, and most of its other U.S. locations will follow suit by May. The fresh beef expansion comes as McDonald’s is improving food quality and increasing menu variety to counter competition from older rivals such as Wendy’s Co as well as more premium chains like Chick-fil-A, In-N-Out and Shake Shack Inc.  One year ago, McDonald’s announced plans to sell some of its burgers made with fresh - rather than frozen - beef in the majority of its roughly 14,000 U.S. restaurants by mid-2018 to produce juicier burgers. McDonald’s U.S President Chris Kempczinski called the switch to fresh beef Quarter Pounders the most significant change to restaurant operations since the company began offering all-day breakfast in 2015.     The project has required changes by kitchen crews and suppliers. “Our suppliers have invested about $60 million updating their supply chain to be able to make this conversion from frozen to fresh,” Kempczinski told reporters. Franchisees were initially concerned about what cooking made-to-order burgers would do to service time, he later told Reuters. “If it slows down the drive-through, that’s the critical part of our business. And so we just had to spend a lot of time really making sure that as we were cooking only when someone ordered, we’d figured out a way to do it that wasn’t going to slow down service time,” he said. Fresh beef Quarter Pounders and premium “signature crafted” burgers are now available in restaurants in Miami, Orlando and Nashville. Over the next month, the rollout will add Los Angeles, Houston and San Francisco. McDonald’s also announced on Tuesday a new premium burger, called Garlic White Cheddar and said it would release more “signature crafted” sandwiches later in the year. Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has made many changes since taking the helm three years ago, including eliminating artificial preservatives from the company’s popular McNuggets, slimming down its Happy Meal menus for children and reversing traffic declines with help from all-day breakfast. The new processes and technology have created anxiety for some franchisees who are grappling with a tight labor market.  “There’s no question that we’re being asked to do more, faster than we previously were. But if we don’t stay ahead, particularly on technology, I believe that would be a mistake,” said Joe Jasper, who owns 20 McDonald’s franchises in Texas.

1264,MCD,"McDonald's flips to fresh beef in 3,500 U.S. restaurants","OAK BROOK, Ill. (Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp said on Tuesday that it had begun serving fresh beef Quarter Pounders and other premium burgers at about 3,500 restaurants in the United States, and most of its other U.S. locations will follow suit by May. The fresh beef expansion comes as McDonald’s is improving food quality and increasing menu variety to counter competition from older rivals such as Wendy’s Co as well as more premium chains like Chick-fil-A, In-N-Out and Shake Shack Inc.  One year ago, McDonald’s announced plans to sell some of its burgers made with fresh - rather than frozen - beef in the majority of its roughly 14,000 U.S. restaurants by mid-2018 to produce juicier burgers.

1267,MCD,McDonald's agrees settlement in franchisees' U.S. labor case,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) said on Monday it had agreed to settle a  U.S. labor board case on whether the company is accountable for its franchisees’ alleged labor law violations. The settlement, which must be approved by a National Labor Relations Board judge, would allow McDonald’s to avoid a ruling that it is a “joint employer” of workers at McDonald’s franchises and can be held liable when franchisees violate federal labor law. McDonald’s, which did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement, said in a statement that it was pleased to resolve the claims.  “While the settlement is not yet final, we believe this is a major first step in ending this wasteful multi-year litigation,” the company said.   The exact terms of the settlement were not immediately clear.  Business groups had said that a ruling against McDonald’s could upend the franchising model by making franchisors more vulnerable to lawsuits and requiring them to bargain with unions representing franchise workers. Illinois-based McDonald’s and the office of NLRB General Counsel Peter Robb presented the settlement to an administrative judge at a hearing in New York.  Union-backed worker advocacy group Fight for $15 filed dozens of legal claims on behalf of McDonald’s workers beginning in 2012. The group said workers across the United States were fired for taking part in protests calling for higher wages.  The judge had agreed in January to pause the trial against McDonald’s that began in 2015 so that Robb, an appointee of President Donald Trump, could pursue settlement talks with the company. Fight for $15 lawyer Micah Wissinger said the group would object to the proposed settlement.  “In a real settlement, McDonald’s would take responsibility for illegally firing and harassing workers fighting to get off food stamps and out of poverty,” he said. The case was seen as an important test of how a 2015 NLRB decision that had rankled business groups by making it easier to prove that a company is a joint employer would apply to franchisees.  In December, a new Republican majority on the board overturned the 2015 decision and said only companies with direct control over workers may be considered joint employers. Last month, the board said its December ruling was invalid because NLRB member William Emanuel, a Trump appointee, had a conflict of interest.

1272,MCD,McDonald's sets greenhouse gas reduction targets,"(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp on Tuesday announced an approved, science based target to cut greenhouse gas emissions and battle climate change, saying it is the first restaurant company to do so. Under a plan several years in the making, the fast-food company - along with its franchisees and suppliers - aims to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by roughly one third, preventing 150 million tonnes of them from being released into the atmosphere by 2030.  “To meet this goal, we will source our food responsibly, promote renewable energy and use it efficiently, and reduce waste and increase recycling,” McDonald’s Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said.  The commitment comes as President Donald Trump works to weaken Obama-era efforts to combat climate change. Trump decided last year to pull the United States out of the Paris climate pact.  Meat processor Tyson Foods Inc, one of McDonald’s suppliers, is among the hundreds of companies that already have committed to fight climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions. McDonald’s said it would put the greatest emphasis on the largest contributors to its carbon footprint: beef production, restaurant energy usage and sourcing, packaging and waste. Those segments combined account for approximately 64 percent of McDonald’s global emissions, the company said. Among other things, it will support sustainable agricultural practices and packaging. It also plans to install energy-efficient lighting and kitchen equipment, and to encourage recycling in its restaurants. Between 2015 and 2030, McDonald’s and its partners intend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to its restaurants and offices by 36 percent. The company also aims to reduce emissions intensity per tonne of food and packaging by 31 percent during that time frame.  McDonald’s program was approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, a collaboration between the World Resources Institute, the World Wildlife Fund, CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and the United Nations Global Compact, which help companies address climate change.  “We are about halfway there already on (total) packaging and waste,” Francesca DeBiase, McDonald’s chief supply chain and sustainability officer.  The planned reductions are the equivalent of taking 32 million passenger cars off the road for an entire year or planting 3.8 billion trees and growing them for 10 years. CEO Easterbrook, who also has committed to reducing antibiotic use in chicken and cutting artificial ingredients, said the costs would not be disruptive. “We’re not expecting any substantial shift in business financials either at the corporate or restaurant level,” Easterbrook said.

1274,MCD,"Monsanto backs new company focused on gene editing, not GMOs","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Monsanto Co will fund a new U.S. company that aims to develop crops using technology known as gene editing, rather than the genetic modification that helped it become the world’s biggest seed seller. Monsanto’s vice president of global biotechnology, Tom Adams, will leave the seed giant to become chief executive of the new firm, called Pairwise Plants, the companies told Reuters. He steps into the new role on April 1. The collaboration accelerates a race among agricultural scientists and companies worldwide to develop new seeds for crops using gene editing, a process they say can produce non-GMO farm products that do not contain foreign DNA from a different species. Unlike traditional GMOs, in which a gene is added from another organism, gene-editing works like the find-and-replace function on a word processor. It finds a gene and then makes changes by amending or deleting it. Using “molecular scissors” to cut DNA means scientists can edit genomes more precisely and rapidly than ever before, and altered agricultural products could get to market more quickly and cheaply. Monsanto, famous for engineering soybeans to resist the weed killer Roundup, will pay Pairwise $100 million over the next five years to finance research on gene editing tools, Adams said in an interview.  Pairwise will also research how to use the tools to alter commodity crops, including corn, soy, wheat, cotton and canola, exclusively for Monsanto, according to the companies. The deal allows Monsanto, which is being acquired by Bayer AG, to commercialize products from the partnership. “The collaboration really will help accelerate the development of the technology,” said Robb Fraley, Monsanto’s chief technology officer. Separately, Monsanto’s venture capital arm, along with investment firm Deerfield Management, each committed $12.5 million to form Pairwise as part of a Series A financing round, according to Pairwise.  Among Pairwise’s founders is David Liu, a Harvard University professor who pioneered a new form of gene editing that the company said allows scientists to make more precise changes to plant genomes.    Pairwise aims to hire up to 100 people in its first two years, said Haven Baker, who will be chief business officer. Baker formerly worked for McDonald’s Corp potato supplier J.R. Simplot Company on the development of a biotech potato. Beyond commodity crops, Pairwise intends to use gene editing for research on other plants, possibly including fruit. “We want to make food crops more convenient, affordable and sustainable,” Baker said.

1277,MCD,McDonald's says it's the final straw as cuts down on plastic,"LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - McDonald’s on Wednesday became the latest big company in Britain  to say it was the last straw for plastic - with plans to start  using drinking straws made from paper. The move comes after estimates that 8.5 billion straws are used in Britain every year – or more than 23 million a day – which is contributing to the death of marine animals, according to the Marine Conservation Society. The fast-food giant joins a list of nightclubs and restaurant venues - including Pizza Express, pub chain Wetherspoons, and supermarket Waitrose -  which have pledged to dump plastic straws for bio-degradable alternatives. “The reduction and use of plastics is an hugely important issue – for our business, for the sector and for society,” Paul Pomroy, chief executive of McDonald’s UK, said in a statement. He said McDonald’s only currently used recyclable straws but would pilot paper straws in some restaurants from May and keep them behind the counter, giving customers the choice of whether or not to have a straw. The widening ban on plastic straws comes as United Nations figures show eight million tonnes of plastic - bottles, packaging and other waste - enter the ocean each year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain. Scientists have urged tougher restrictions on plastic waste. In December, almost 200 nations agreed to limit plastic pollution of the oceans, warning it could outweigh fish by 2030. The Marine Conservation Society said about 70 percent of litter on beaches was made of plastic with items such as straws, cups and stirrers making up over 20 percent of the litter. “We really want to see all plastic straws being removed from all the fast food chains ... customers clearly do not choose to recycle convenience packaging,” Emma Cunningham, a campaign officer at the Marine Conservation Society, said in a statement. As well as changes to packaging, the British government unveiled plans this week to introduce a deposit return scheme  later this year by which people get a 10 pence refund for plastic and glass bottles and aluminum cans.

McDonald’s, which in January reported its highest sales growth in six years, currently serves 150 million customers a year in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland from its around 430 restaurants in the region. Starting in May, the fast food chain will begin home delivery in Sweden and Finland, followed by Denmark and Norway in the second half of the year. Elsewhere in Europe, the company already offers home delivery in Britain, Germany and the Netherlands among other countries.  “I think it’s about being where consumers want to meet us,” McDonald’s Nordic Group CEO Christer Aberg said in an interview. The expansion will create 5,000 jobs in the region, the company said. Last year, McDonald’s sales the Nordic region grew 5 percent to 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion).

1285,MCD,Volatile ruble encourages McDonald's to cook up Russian fries,"LIPETSK, Russia (Reuters) - French fries at McDonald’s restaurants from Moscow to Murmansk will be Russian from now on, as the American fast-food chain turns to homegrown potatoes to deal with rouble volatility caused by fluctuating oil prices and Western sanctions. McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N), which opened in Russia in 1990 as the Soviet Union collapsed, has been gradually turning to local ingredients in its Russian outlets for everything from Big Macs to chicken burgers since it opened its doors there. But till now it had relied on frozen French fries from the Netherlands and Poland as Russian spuds weren’t quite right. “There was no potato which would suit us in terms of quality - color, taste, size – these are all the details that are important for us,” Khamzat Khasbulatov, chairman of McDonald’s Russia, told Reuters.     The firm had worked on a project to use local potatoes in 2011 but the plan fell through when European financing was frozen in a row over Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. The rouble has gyrated since then with oil price swings and due to Western sanctions. “The ruble’s volatility was one of the major components of our interest in localization,” Khasbulatov said.  Now a new plant near Lipetsk, a city 450 km (280 miles) south of Moscow, using potatoes grown on local farms will supply frozen fries to the chain of 651 outlets across Russia under a long-term contract, raising the share of the chain’s locally sourced products to 98 percent. “This gives us the possibility to continue our development in a more stable way,” the chairman said. “It minimizes the risks connected to customs and administrative decisions, and guarantees stable, predictable prices in rubles.” The plant, worth 8.7 billion rubles, was built jointly by Russian agricultural group Belaya Dacha and the Netherlands-based Lamb Weston Meijer, both long-time partners of McDonald’s. The factory has capacity to process 200,000 tonnes of potatoes a year, washing, cutting and freezing the vegetables. The rouble has recovered some ground as the price of oil, a major revenue earner for Russia, has risen from a low in 2016.      Russia’s response to Western sanctions included a 2014 ban on a range of Western food imports. “Sanctions as well as counter sanctions not only affect our company but the whole industry and the economy,” said Khasbulatov, whose firm has 50,000 Russian employees and more than 160 domestic suppliers. “But in any case we continue our development, continue to build new restaurants and modernize existing ones,” he said, adding that firm opened 41 restaurants in Russia in 2017.

1287,MCD,"McDonald's serves up quarterly beat on higher global sales, U.S. spending","(Reuters) - McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) blew past analysts’ forecasts for profit and revenue on Monday, helped by higher sales in overseas markets and as U.S. customers spent more at its outlets. Shares of the world's biggest fast food chain by revenue rose more than 5 percent as global same-restaurant sales topped Wall Street forecasts, driven by the strength in mature markets especially the United Kingdom and Germany. The stock was also the top gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI. The results underscore the success of Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook’s multi-year turnaround plan launched in 2015 to refresh McDonald’s menus, add more technology to stores and make outlets more welcoming for customers. New changes also included adding more high-margin “gourmet” burgers, which use fresher and more expensive ingredients and  cost $6 or $7, and new $1 to $3 value options.  Same-restaurant sales in its most profitable market, the United States, rose 2.9 percent and topped analysts’ expectations on higher average check tallies that was propelled by consumers opting for $1-$3 value menu items, while also adding more expensive burgers. “The value price menu does bring people in, but people tend to spend more ... people still want a number of key McDonald’s items like the Quarter Pounder and the Big Mac,” Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said. McDonald’s and other fast food chains have been concentrating on drawing customers with cheap options as they battle for a bigger share of a pie that is not growing.  But a weak initial consumer response to the company’s $1-$3 menu prompted McDonald’s to offer a 2 for $4 “mix & match” deal on breakfast sandwiches to thwart intense competition in the all-day breakfast category, Easterbrook said on a post-earnings analyst call. Customer visits in the U.S. declined, but rose notably in Japan, France, Australia and Canada leading to an overall traffic rise of 0.8 percent.     Global sales at stores open at least 13 months rose 5.5 percent, easily topping an average estimate of 3.94 percent.  “(This) shows the power of the brand ... globally the numbers were outstanding,” Peter Saleh, an analyst with brokerage BTIG, said. “The results were very impressive, actually more impressive than we initially had anticipated.” Excluding items, McDonald’s earned $1.79 per share, beating the estimate of $1.67.

1289,MCD,U.S. fast-food price war flares as consumer spending softens,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Cheap fast-food “dollar” deals surged in the United States during the first quarter, marking a major shift in strategy as a cool-down in consumer spending sent restaurant chains scrambling for customers. So-called “value” offers have been part of the U.S. fast-food landscape since 2002, when McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) debuted its popular Dollar Menu and gave the industry a reliable recipe for driving traffic. McDonald’s and other major chains deemphasized such deals in recent years, choosing instead to invest in food quality improvements to bolster competitiveness with more upscale brands like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) and Chick-fil-A. Dollar deals roared back in the first three months of this year, when economists estimate consumer spending growth braked to below a 1.5 percent rate. That would be the slowest pace in nearly five years and follows the prior quarter’s robust 4 percent growth rate.      Value menu traffic was up 10 percent for the first three months of 2018, while value menu sales chalked up a 13 percent gain, NPD Group analyst Bonnie Riggs told Reuters. The results lifted value menu traffic 1 percent for the fiscal year ended March 2018, reversing three consecutive years of declines, according to NPD.     “It’s clear that major restaurant chain operators are pulling out all of the stops to get consumers to visit this year,” said Riggs, author of a new report titled “Value Wars 2.0: The Value Menu Strikes Back.” Restaurants across the spectrum have been battling for a bigger slice of a pie that is not growing. Total U.S. restaurant traffic was flat in calendar 2017. Yum Brand Inc’s (YUM.N) Taco Bell, known for its low-priced food and “Dollar Cravings” value menu, appears to have an edge in the latest price war. It sold a record 53 million orders of its new $1 Nacho Fries in five weeks during the first quarter, contributing to outsized value menu sales gains, NPD said.   Taco Bell declined comment, citing the quiet period ahead of Yum Brands’ financial report on Wednesday. McDonald’s, seeking to win back customers lost after it abandoned its popular but profit-squeezing Dollar Menu in 2013, in January jumped back in with the launch of a $1, $2, $3 value menu. That menu includes $1 any size soft drinks and cheeseburgers, $2 small espresso drinks and Bacon McDouble hamburgers, and $3 Happy Meals and classic chicken sandwiches.  Consumer response was initially muted, prompting some McDonald’s restaurants to offer a 2 for $4 “mix & match” deal on breakfast sandwiches such as the sausage McMuffin with egg.  McDonald’s, scheduled to report quarterly results on Monday, declined to comment.  Meanwhile, some McDonald’s restaurant operators worry about getting lost in a blizzard of competing deals.  “In 2002 we were one of the few chains discounting ...  Today we are just part of the discounting noise,” one McDonald’s restaurant operator was quoted as saying in the latest McDonald’s Franchisee Survey from Kalinowski Equity Research. The fast-food value wars are contributing to an increasingly challenging operating environment, Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) CEO Nigel Travis told investors last week.  Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees, who were slow to warm to value deals, this month are responding with offers for $2 egg and cheese Wake-up Wraps, $3 egg and cheese English muffin breakfast sandwiches and $5 egg, cheese and bacon breakfast croissants. Some investors worry that the dollar deals - including the $1 any size drinks and $2 small McCafe drinks from McDonald’s - are siphoning business from Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O), which last week posted its second consecutive quarter with no U.S.  traffic growth.  Starbucks, for its part, is adding specials to woo “occasional” customers who visit one to five times per month.

1290,MCD,UPDATE 3-Yum says UK KFC supply snafu will be drag on Q2 results,"(Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc’s (YUM.N) sales at established restaurants rose at just half the pace expected by Wall Street, after a chicken supply shortage hammered sales at KFC in the UK and Pizza Hut struggled in China.  Shares in the company that also owns the Taco Bell brand fell 5 percent early on Wednesday, after its chief financial officer said lingering concerns at KFC UK would contribute to the current quarter likely being “the worst” of the year. Sales at Yum restaurants open at least a year rose 1 percent in the three months ended March 31, compared with the 2 percent expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The results contrasted with stronger-than-expected global quarterly sales from McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Domino’s Pizza Inc (DPZ.N), indicating that Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum may have lost market share during the quarter. Same-restaurant sales at KFC rose 2 percent in the first quarter of 2018, missing analysts’ target with the slowest growth rate in four quarters.  On a conference call with analysts, Yum executives said KFC would have recorded a 3 percent growth in same-restaurant sales had it not been for a serious supply snafu in the United Kingdom, where it has 871 restaurants.  Yum was forced to shut hundreds of British KFC outlets in February after a supplier change led to shortages of everything from chicken to gravy. The restaurants have mostly resumed operations and executives expect to restart advertising this month.  Pizza Hut also missed expectations for same-restaurant sales, which were up 1 percent worldwide, after strength in the United States offset a decline in China.  Overall revenue at Yum fell 3 percent to $1.37 billion but topped estimates of $1.09 billion, thanks to stronger sales at Taco Bell, where $1 Nacho Fries debuted as its best-selling new product in history. Net income jumped to $433 million from $280 million last year, reflecting gains from the sale of company-owned restaurants to franchisees. Excluding one-time items, Yum earned 90 cents per share, ahead of expectations of 68 cents.

1291,MCD,Wendy's North America same-store sales miss estimates,"(Reuters) - Wendy’s Co (WEN.O) reported lower-than-expected first-quarter sales at its established outlets in North America, as the burger chain struggled to attract enough diners in a fiercely competitive restaurant industry. The company’s shares were down more than 5 percent in after-market trading. Wendy’s same-restaurant sales in North America, its biggest market, rose 1.6 percent in the reported quarter, but missed estimates for the third straight one. Analysts on average had expected same-store sales to rise 1.8 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.

In contrast, bigger rival McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) reported same-store sales that topped estimates, driven by higher average check tallies that was propelled by consumers opting for $1-$3 value menu items, while also adding more expensive burgers. Wendy’s and other fast-food chains such as McDonald’s have been battling each other with dollar menus, discounts and limited-time menu items as consumer spending cools, while also launching freshly prepared meals to attract diners. Still Wendy’s stock has outperformed its peers so far this year. While the S&P; 500 Restaurants sub index .SPLRCREST is down nearly 1 percent, Wendy’s rose 5.7 percent.

1293,MCD,Pizza Hut expanding beer delivery test in Arizona and California,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc’s (YUM.N) Pizza Hut chain is expanding a beer delivery test to nearly 100 restaurants in Arizona and California this month as industry leaders vie for market share in the face of sluggish growth. Operators are seeking creative ways to boost sales as restaurant traffic growth has been weak to flat for several years due to competition ranging from grocery stores that sell prepared food to a proliferation of meal kit companies.     Pizza Hut started its beer delivery project in downtown Phoenix in December as part of a larger push to set the chain apart from rivals like Domino’s Pizza Inc (DPZ.N).  Domino’s does not deliver alcohol, but it recently added 150,000 new delivery “hotspots” at U.S. parks, beaches and other destinations that do not have traditional addresses in a bid find new business. The enlarged Pizza Hut test will include Arizona cities such as Tucson, Prescott and Winslow. California cities include Los Angeles, Bakersfield, Sacramento and Santa Barbara.       More than 1,700 of Pizza Hut’s roughly 6,300 U.S. units  have liquor licenses, giving the chain a potential lead over some rivals. “Many Pizza Hut restaurants are already licensed to serve and distribute beer, without third party services, additional fees, or extended wait times,” Pizza Hut Chief Marketing Officer Zipporah Allen told Reuters. Pizza Hut’s beer delivery drivers will be at least 21 years old and trained in local alcohol laws, the company said. They have the authority to cancel a beer delivery order if customers cannot verify they are old enough to legally consume alcohol.  Pizza Hut’s announcement landed hours after privately held Panera Bread Co said it had completed the national roll-out of its own food delivery service to 897 cities. While pizza chains and Panera do their own delivery, many other restaurants farm the work out to companies that take a slice of revenue. Strategy firm Pentallect Inc has forecast that U.S. third-party food delivery industry sales will grow from $13 billion in 2017 to $24.5 billion by 2022. Pizza Hut parent Yum, which also owns the Taco Bell and KFC brands, earlier this year spent $200 million to buy a 3 percent stake in food delivery company GrubHub Inc (GRUB.N).   McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) partners with UberEats for fast-food delivery in the United States. DoorDash, which delivers craft beer six-packs for BJ’s Restaurants Inc (BJRI.O) in some California markets, has been offering alcohol delivery in select cities since 2016.
