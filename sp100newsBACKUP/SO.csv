1,SO,"EPA rule aims to cut smog, soot from coal plants","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. environmental regulators finalized a rule on Thursday to slash air pollution from coal-fired power plants in 27 states east of the Rocky Mountains that result in unhealthy levels of smog and soot.  The Environmental Protection Agency measure, known as the Cross State Air Pollution Rule, will add costs for some power generators, but should cut health care bills for Americans.  Companies that could see higher costs include large coal burners Southern Co, Duke Energy and American Electric Power.  “No community should have to bear the burden of another community’s polluters, or be powerless to prevent air pollution that leads to asthma, heart attacks and other harmful illnesses,” said EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson.  The EPA rule will reduce power plant sulfur dioxide emissions by 73 percent by 2014, from 2005 levels, when combined with state environmental laws. It will cut nitrogen oxide emissions by 54 percent by 2014. Those cuts are slightly deeper than ones proposed by the EPA last year.  Power plants have to start cutting their sulfur dioxide emissions in January 2012 and their nitrogen oxide emissions that May.  In addition, the state of Texas will now be required to cut sulfur dioxide emissions in an annual program, a measure that was not included in last year’s proposal.  The agency said the rule would prevent up to 34,000 premature deaths, and save $280 billion per year in health costs. The pollution is linked to heart attacks and lung problems including asthma.  Those benefits outweigh the $800 million projected to be spent by power plants and others annually on the rule in 2014 and the roughly $1.6 billion per year in capital investments already underway from previous rules, the EPA said.  The rule will also level the playing field for power plant operators that are already controlling these emissions by requiring more plants to take similar actions, it said.  Not everyone was happy about the regulation.  “The late decision to apply the rule to Texas and the modeling for the rule have resulted in wholly unreasonable mandates and unrealistic timelines for Texas,” Luminant, a unit of private company Energy Future Holdings, and the biggest power producer in Texas, said in a release.  Shares of Southern Co were down 0.4 percent on Thursday, while Duke Energy and American Electric Power both rose less than 0.5 percent.  The rule resulted from a federal appeals court order instructing the EPA to strengthen a similar regulation issued in 2005 by the  Bush administration.  It is opposed by many Republicans in Congress, who say it will kill jobs and could make transmission of electricity unreliable because it would force companies to shut some of their coal plants.  But the argument that the rule will hurt transmission is a “red herring” because plants integral to power delivery would not be allowed to shut down, said Susan Tierney, a managing principal at the Analysis Group, an organization of economic and financial consultants.  She said only the oldest, least efficient and smaller coal plants would be shut as a result of rules to be issued this year by the EPA on power plants.  Environmentalists praised the EPA. The Clean Air Task Force said the rule was a “solid victory for clean air and public health.”  The EPA will take public comment for 45 days on a supplemental rule that would require six states — Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Oklahoma and Wisconsin — to reduce nitrogen oxide pollution in the summer months. That rule is expected to be finalized late this year.  ",7072011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-smog/epa-rule-aims-to-cut-smog-soot-from-coal-plants-idUSTRE7664GD20110707

3,SO,"Analysis:After Japan, slow change seen for U.S. nuclear industry","WASHINGTON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. nuclear industry this week gets its first peek at a roadmap for new regulations that ultimately could cost it billions in the wake of Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi disaster.  But the bottom-line impact of Fukushima on the U.S. fleet of 104 reactors could take most of the next decade to calculate.  Most expect Tuesday’s report from a task force of senior staff members at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to be just the first step in years of deliberation and rule-making to ensure U.S. plants can better withstand catastrophes like the March earthquake and tsunami that wrecked the Fukushima plant.  The head of the U.S. NRC has said he wants the agency to move as fast as it can to ensure the world’s largest nuclear power producer can withstand catastrophes.  The last time the commission carried out such regulatory soul-searching — after the September 11, 2001 attacks — it took a decade to get the entire plan in place.  After Fukushima, the world’s worst nuclear accident in 25 years, the NRC is expected to step up requirements for U.S. plants to be able keep running even if they lose power for days or weeks.  “I do think that the industry is expecting to make some changes that will cost a great deal of money,” said Craven Crowell, a former chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, a government-owned utility, who has worked in the nuclear industry for more than 30 years.  The changes could be expensive for plant owners, such as Exelon, Entergy and PG&E, and could affect the first new plants planned in 30 years — Southern Co’s Vogtle plant in Georgia and SCANA Corp’s facility in South Carolina.  It will take time for NRC staff and the five-member commission to agree on the detailed changes needed, and send those changes through the tortuous rule-making process.  “In general, we’re probably looking at a two- to three-year timeframe, at least,” said Daniel Stenger, a partner in the Washington, D.C. office of law firm Hogan Lovells that focuses on nuclear energy.  The sometimes-fractious commission will need to find consensus to move forward. Commissioners are slated to give their first public statements on the task force recommendations at a public hearing on July 19.  NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko, seen as the most activist member of the commission, has urged an expedited timeline.  “It, I think, will not be acceptable if 10 years from now we’re still working through the recommendations of this task force,” Jaczko said at a May hearing.  The NRC last overhauled its rules after the September 11, 2001 attacks, when plants were seen as potential targets. It took until 2009 for the agency to finalize a comprehensive set of rules, and one regulation concerning emergency preparedness has yet to be finalized.  Almost 10 years later, a dozen of the 64 nuclear power stations in the country are still working to comply with the rules, according to NRC records.  “There is no question that the nuclear industry dragged its feet after 9/11 in implementing the security upgrades needed to adequately protect their plants against terrorist attacks,” said Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group that advocates for nuclear safety.  NRC officials said that while the beefed-up security measures took years to finalize, interim safety measures were already in place at nuclear facilities around the country.  “We took a full array of comprehensive, substantial steps that were in place by October 2004 in direct response to NRC requirements within the deadline that was established at the time,” said Steve Kerekes, a spokesman for the industry’s trade group, the Nuclear Energy Institute.  The 1986 Chernobyl disaster led to little U.S. industry change due to major design differences between U.S. plants and the Russian reactor that lacked safety features, accident alert procedures and close regulation.  After the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979, President Jimmy Carter appointed a 12-member commission within two weeks to study and recommend changes for plants.  That work took about 18 months, but some of the changes were later found to be unnecessary and counterproductive.  The industry created a peer-review group, the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, to raise safety standards. INPO has been suggested as a model for a global nuclear enforcement agency after Fukushima.  It took about a decade before the industry and regulator fully understood what happened at Three Mile Island, recalled Margaret Harding, a former vice president at GE-Hitachi responsible for engineering quality.  It will take years before all the details of the Fukushima disaster are fully understood, and some of the most technical changes may need to wait until the jury is in, Harding said.  “It’s kind of like recalling cars without knowing what’s wrong,” said Harding, now an industry consultant.  But the NRC does not need to wait for all the details on the disaster to know that it needs to examine how well-equipped plants are to withstand a long-term power blackout, she said.  “Our expectation is that it’s going to take years to fully digest and discern lessons from Japan,” the NEI’s Kerekes said. “That doesn’t mean we are waiting; we’ve already taken numerous steps and we will continue to do that.”  The release of the task force report is expected to kick off a second, more detailed six-month review in which the public and the industry can share their views with the NRC.  The NRC has so far ignored public calls to hold off on renewing operating licenses for aging plants and making decisions on new reactor designs until the Fukushima reviews are complete.  “We want a procedure set up so that new licenses and renewed licenses are not approved unless there’s an opportunity for public participation,” said Diane Curran, a public interest lawyer in Washington who has represented groups fighting power plants for 30 years.  The NRC needs to take its time to examine fully whether its rules and inspections need to be ratcheted up to deal with disasters that go beyond the “design basis” that plants are currently required to live up to, Curran said.  “It does seem to be one of the lessons of the Fukushima accident that the whole regulatory program needs to shift,” she said.

6,SO,UPDATE 3-US report urges overhaul of nuclear rules," * Total of 34 recommendations made in 82-page report  * Looked at how to improve US safety after Fukushima  * Recommends tougher approach to emergency plans  * No imminent risk seen from current system-report  * “It’s a laundry list”-analyst  (Adds comments and details throughout)  By Roberta Rampton and Eileen O’Grady  WASHINGTON/HOUSTON, July 12 (Reuters) - A key task force formed after the Fukushima disaster recommended the U.S. nuclear regulator take a new, tougher approach to safety, which could force plants to plan for catastrophes far beyond what they were originally designed to withstand.  In the most far-reaching review of U.S. nuclear safety since the Sept. 11 attacks a decade ago, the report suggests a philosophical shift is needed to unify a patchwork of formal rules and industry guidelines, ensuring all are overseen by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Among the 34 recommendations, the task force urged tougher standards for back-up power supplies, back-up water supplies for pools holding plant waste, and improvements in reactors that share the same design as Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi plant.  The report is the U.S. government’s most definitive response yet to the earthquakes and floods that caused a partial meltdown at Fukushima. America’s response could set a template for other nations that look to the world’s biggest nuclear power generator to set the standard for safety.  If adopted, the report could lead to cost increases for operators of the nation’s fleet of 104 reactors, such as Exelon (EXC.N), Entergy (ETR.N), and PG&E (PCG.N). The industry is already grappling with the competitive threat from cheap and abundant supplies of natural gas.  It’s hard to say how much the ideas could cost the industry, said Christine Tezak, an energy policy analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co, noting much will depend on details of decisions still to be made by the NRC.  “It’s a laundry list. Whether this adds up to a cooling tower and puts you out of business, it’s too early to tell,” Tezak said.  The five-member Nuclear Regulatory Commission will need to decide whether the regulatory shift is warranted. The task force did not find any immediate safety issues.  “The current regulatory approach and more importantly the resultant plant capabilities allowed the task force to conclude that a sequence of events like that in Fukushima is unlikely to occur in the United States,” according to the report obtained by Reuters Tuesday evening.  The report, which the NRC will officially release on Wednesday, is likely to disappoint nuclear critics who had called for the U.S. regulator to pause on renewing licenses for aging plants, and making decisions on new reactors. The task force did not go that far.  “Continued operation and continued licensing activities do not pose an imminent risk to public health and safety,” the report said.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   FACTBOX-What’s in the task force report?

It could take years before officials fully understand what happened there, prompting a senior lawmaker to label the task force ideas as premature.  “Why has the NRC suddenly recommended sweeping regulatory changes in this report apparently without an adequate technical or regulatory basis to justify these modifications?” said James Inhofe, senior Republican on the Senate’s Environment and Public Works committee, which has oversight of the NRC.  The Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobby group, also said more information was needed from Japan.  “A 90-day review does not permit a complete picture of a still-emerging situation,” the group said in a statement.  But Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat and long-time industry critic, said the NRC should move ahead quickly.  Markey said he was disappointed the report did not enlarge emergency evacuation zones around nuclear power plants, nor recommend that spent fuel be moved into dry casks from pools, where most of the radioactive waste is currently stored.  The task force praised new reactors that include passive features, saying the new designs would be in line with many of its recommendations. It urged the NRC to complete its review “without delay” of Toshiba Corp’s (6502.T) Westinghouse AP1000 reactor and GE-Hitachi’s (6501.T) Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor.  The AP1000 is the reactor design of choice for the nation’s first new nuclear plants in 30 years — Southern Co (SO.N) in Georgia and SCANA Corp (SCG.N) in South Carolina.  The NRC will next embark on a six-month broader review, and is expected to invite industry and the public to participate.  Commissioners are slated to give their first public statements on the task force recommendations at a public hearing on July 19, while Chairman Gregory Jaczko — who is pushing for an expedited response — will speak publicly at a National Press Club event a day earlier.

It could also affect utilities planning the nation’s first new nuclear plants in 30 years — Southern Co in Georgia and SCANA Corp in South Carolina — although new nuclear plants are already grappling with the competitive threat from cheap and abundant supplies of natural gas.  But the five-member Nuclear Regulatory Commission would first need to decide whether the shift is warranted. The task force, in its series of 34 recommendations, did not find any immediate safety issues.  “The current regulatory approach and more importantly the resultant plant capabilities allowed the task force to conclude that a sequence of events like that in Fukushima is unlikely to occur in the United States,” said a copy of the report obtained by Reuters.  The report is likely to disappoint nuclear critics who had called for the U.S. regulator to pause on renewing licenses for aging plants, and making decisions on new reactors — but the task force did not go that far, the source said.  “Continued operation and continued licensing activities do not pose an imminent risk to public health and safety,” the report said.  FUKUSHIMA SPARKED REGULATORY SOUL-SEARCH  The March 11 earthquake and tsunami overwhelmed the large Fukushima nuclear plant, and officials in Japan continue to grapple with cleaning up radioactive waste from the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 25 years.  The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered its task force to examine the disaster for “lessons learned.” The NRC will now embark on a six-month broader review, and is expected to invite industry and the public to participate.  Many of the report’s recommendations dealt with shoring up back-up systems to kick in when plants lose all sources of power, as happened after the March 11 quake and tsunami in Japan overwhelmed the Fukushima plant.  The report recommended 11 orders — instructions for plants that the commission could implement quickly, if it agreed to do so.  One suggested order would see NRC inspectors renew checks to ensure plants live up to seismic standards, the report said.  It also included seven rule-makings, which tend to take at least two years to complete, and often much longer.  Part of the shift would bring voluntary industry guidelines about mitigating severe accidents under the regulator’s purview, which would require extensive rule-making.  Commissioners are slated to give their first public statements on the task force recommendations at a public hearing on July 19, while Chairman Gregory Jaczko — who is pushing for an expedited response — will speak publicly at a National Press Club event a day earlier.

8,SO,UPDATE 3-AEP halts carbon capture plan on US climate inaction," * AEP cites weak economy, lack of U.S. carbon plan  * DOE picked AEP for up to $334 million in CCS funding  (Changes dateline, previous NEW YORK, adds comment from analyst, Energy Dept)  By Timothy Gardner and Ayesha Rascoe  WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - American Electric Power Co Inc (AEP.N) on Thursday shelved plans to capture heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions from a coal-burning power plant in West Virginia, citing the U.S. government’s failure to put a price on the emissions.  The move by Ohio-based AEP is a blow to U.S. efforts to rein in carbon dioxide emissions from coal plants using carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS, which experts see as the most viable way of limiting emissions from existing plants.   AEP’s exit illustrates the quandary of big investor-owned utilities, which are reluctant to proceed with massive pollution-reduction investments without clear rules of the road to ensure that they will be able to recoup their costs.  Experts had expected the costly technology would be supported by putting a price on carbon emissions: Coal plants could get credit for each tonne of the gas they permanently trapped underground. But the Senate last year failed to pass a bill that would have slapped first-ever limits on utility carbon emissions.  AEP, one of the biggest U.S. CO2 emitters, cited the congressional inaction and weak economy in its decision to table the $668 million project to build an industrial-scale carbon capture facility at its 31-year-old Mountaineer coal plant in West Virginia.  “We are placing the project on hold until economic and policy conditions create a viable path forward,” Michael Morris, AEP chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.  AEP’s system was designed to capture at least 90 percent of the carbon dioxide from 235 megawatts of the 1,300-MW plant.  The CO2, about 1.5 million tonnes per year, would be compressed and then injected into rock formations for storage about 1.5 miles (2.4 km) below the surface.  The Ohio-based utility embarked on the CCS project at Mountaineer with a pledge from the U.S. Department of Energy in 2009 to cover half the cost. AEP proceeded on the assumption that the U.S. Congress would soon enact first-ever limits on CO2 emissions, AEP spokesman Pat Hemlepp said.  AEP’s shelving of the pioneer project may make it hard for the administration of President Barack Obama to achieve its goal of incentivizing five to 10 new CCS projects by 2016.  The administration may have to find other ways of cutting U.S. emissions about 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 as the president has promised. Coal-burning power plants account for about a third of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions — the single biggest source.  NOT ANYWHERE CLOSE  CCS for coal is only economic where carbon prices are $70 a tonne and natural gas prices are $15 per million British thermal units, said Michael Blaha, a power analyst in Houston with Wood Mackenzie, an energy research and consulting firm.  Current natural gas prices NGc1 near $4 per per million British thermal units — driven in part by a bounty of unconventional domestic supply extracted from shale formations — has turned the economics of building new power plants on their head.  Building new nuclear plants and some types of wind power is cheaper than building a new CCS plant, Blaha said.   The hope was that federal incentives would drive CCS prices down, but AEP’s move makes future trends uncertain.  “It is unlikely that large-scale implementation of CCS will take place in the absence of some sort of regulatory structure that requires it and allows companies that put projects in place to recover the costs,” said Franklin Orr, director of Precourt Institute for Energy at Stanford University.  AEP and partner French multinational Alstom (ALSO.PA) embarked on the CCS project at Mountaineer with the pledge from the DOE in 2009 to cover half the cost.  Other federally subsidized CCS projects are proceeding, including Southern Co’s (SO.N) 582-megawatt gasified coal plant in Mississippi, which will capture 65 percent of CO2 emissions.  DOE STILL COMMITTED  Even with the difficult economics, the Energy Department is “committed to working with industry partners to develop innovative and cost-competitive technologies that can be deployed on commercial scale,” it said in a release.  Under the terms of department’s agreement with AEP, the company received money when it reached certain milestones. Prior to AEP’s announcement, the department had provided the utility with just $11.5 million of the $334 million.  AEP stock eased 21 cents or about 0.6 percent at Thursday afternoon, while the S&P Utilities index .GSPU remained unchanged.

9,SO,US weighs nuclear subsidies amid budget crunch," * Administration wants $452 mln over 5 years for reactors  * Money, safety concerns with small reactor plan-lawmaker  * Industry says improves safety, produces less waste  By Emily Stephenson  WASHINGTON, July 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. government’s budget crunch combined with safety concerns in the wake of Japan’s nuclear crisis raise important questions about whether the timing is right to subsidize new reactor designs, a top Senate lawmaker said on Thursday.  Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, whose subcommittee oversees Energy Department spending, said she is concerned about the merits of helping nuclear reactor companies pay for costly development work into small modular reactors.  “I’m watching everything get cut back. We’re in one fierce argument over the debt limit. There isn’t going to be money,” Feinstein said at a hearing on the reactors, which are touted as a potential cheaper option for building power plants.  “The one thing that so far is going ahead is the nuclear stuff ... To me, it’s just not the best thing since sliced bread,” Feinstein said.  The reactors, planned by companies including Babcock & Wilcox BWC.N and Toshiba-owned Westinghouse Electric (6502.T), are still on the drawing board, but hold the potential to be built in factories, which would make them cheaper to assemble.  “It’s betting the farm for a lot of utilities” to currently invest in traditional large-scale plants, said Christofer Mowry, president of Babcock & Wilcox’s nuclear energy group.  “If you can cut that investment down by a factor of 10, all of a sudden a lot of drivers for things like loan guarantees go away,” Mowry said.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   FACTBOX-Proposed new US reactors          [ID:nN1E76C16I]   Q+A-Yucca Mountain waste controversy      [ID:nN01166459]   TAKE A LOOK-Japan’s nuclear crisis            [ID:nNUCJP]   TAKE A LOOK-US maps out nuclear reforms     [ID:nNUKEUSA]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>  CHU IS A FAN  The small modular reactors also have “passive” features that enable them to keep cool even during a power blackout, like the one caused by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that overwhelmed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant.  U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu is a fan of the concept, and has said he worries the United States could lose ground in the nuclear energy race without more investment.  The Energy Department has proposed a five-year, $452 million program to share costs for reactors during the extensive design phase, which can take years to get approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  Nuclear supporters hope the design — as well as next-generation reactors such as Westinghouse’s AP1000, under review by the NRC — could help revitalize U.S. nuclear development, which ground to a halt after the accident at Three Mile Island.  Traditional nuclear plants cost at least $8 billion to build, a tall order for utilities facing cheap and abundant supplies of natural gas and uncertainties about the costs of new safety regulations proposed after Fukushima.  The United States is also grappling with what to do with radioactive waste that is stored in pools alongside plants.  JUMP-START NEEDED  Companies need incentives to develop new technologies that have not yet proven profitable, said Peter Lyons, the Energy Department’s assistant secretary for nuclear energy.  Lamar Alexander, the top Republican on the appropriations subcommittee, said he liked the idea of “jump-starting” development as long as subsidies were phased out once the new systems are viable.  A similar cost-sharing program helped Westinghouse get its AP1000 reactor off the ground — a new large-scale passive reactor design favored by Southern Co (SO.N) and SCANA Corp (SCG.N), which are planning to build the first new U.S. nuclear plants in more than 30 years.  The government spent $300 million on that program, while Westinghouse matched its investments and has since also spent “several hundred million” to get the reactor through the regulatory process, said Jim Ferland, president for the company’s Americas region.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is in the final stages of approving the AP1000 reactor.

10,SO,AEP halts carbon capture plan due climate inaction,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Electric Power Co Inc on Thursday shelved plans to capture heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions from a coal-burning power plant in West Virginia, citing a lack of action by the U.S. Congress.  The move by Ohio-based AEP is a blow to U.S. efforts to rein in carbon dioxide emissions from coal plants using carbon capture and storage, or CCS, which experts see as the most viable way of limiting emissions from existing plants.  The company, one of the biggest U.S. CO2 emitters, cited congressional inaction on climate rules and a weak economy in its decision to table the $668 million project to build an industrial-scale carbon capture facility at its 31-year-old Mountaineer coal plant in West Virginia.  “We are placing the project on hold until economic and policy conditions create a viable path forward,” Michael Morris, AEP chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.  AEP’s move illustrates the quandary of big investor-owned utilities, which are reluctant to proceed with massive pollution-reduction investments without clear rules of the road to ensure that they will be able to recoup their costs.  Power plants contribute about 40 percent of the carbon dioxide in the United States with coal-burning plants contributing most of that.  “It is unlikely that large-scale implementation of CCS will take place in the absence of some sort of regulatory structure that requires it and allows companies that put projects in place to recover the costs,” said Franklin Orr, director of Precourt Institute for Energy at Stanford University.  AEP and partner French multinational Alstom embarked on the CCS project at Mountaineer with a pledge from the U.S. Department of Energy in 2009 to cover half the cost. AEP proceeded on the assumption that the U.S. Congress would soon enact first-ever limits on CO2 emissions, AEP spokesman Pat Hemlepp said.  Action on climate change, which was among President Barack Obama’s top priorities, stalled in Congress after Republicans took control of the House of Representatives.  AEP has a large stake in the future shape and timing of U.S. CO2 policy — about 65 percent of its 39,000 megawatts of generation comes from coal plants.  Atlanta-based Southern, another top U.S. coal-burning utility, is building a 582-megawatt gasified coal plant in Kemper County, Mississippi, which will capture 65 percent of CO2 emissions.  The DOE picked AEP to receive funding of up to $334 million to help pay for the installation of a commercial-scale carbon capture and storage system at Mountaineer in West Virginia.  The system was designed to capture at least 90 percent of the carbon dioxide from 235 megawatts of the 1,300-MW plant.  The CO2, about 1.5 million tonnes per year, would be treated and compressed, then injected into rock formations for permanent storage about 1.5 miles below the surface.  Plans were for the project — with funds coming from the government’s Clean Coal Power Initiative — to be completed in four phases, with commercial operation starting in 2015.  “The commercialization of this technology is vital if owners of coal-fueled generation are to comply with potential future climate regulations without prematurely retiring efficient, cost-effective generating capacity,” Morris said.  AEP stock eased 21 cents or about 0.6 percent at Thursday afternoon, while the S&P Utilities index remained unchanged.

12,SO,UPDATE 3-U.S. nuclear chief urges rapid overhaul of rules," * Jaczko wants NRC to provide direction within 90 days  * Says NRC, industry should implement change within 5 yrs  * Will first need to convince fellow NRC commissioners  * Asked if he has support: ""Well, we'll see.""  * Republicans warn Jaczko not to rush to conclusions  (Adds quotes, background, comments from industry, analyst, Republicans)  By Roberta Rampton and Ayesha Rascoe  WASHINGTON, July 18 (Reuters) - The top U.S. nuclear chief wants to push ahead with sweeping regulatory changes for nuclear safety, cutting through the exhaustive technical reviews that typically make for more lengthy deliberations at his agency.  Gregory Jaczko, chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said on Monday he wants the NRC to provide clear direction on changes warranted by Japan's Fukushima Daiichi within 90 days, and for the regulator and the industry to have changes implemented within five years.  That would be about half the time that the NRC and industry took to boost security after the Sept. 11 attacks, which was the last time the agency dealt with major changes to its rules.  ""The Commission may need to do things differently than it normally does. That should not be unexpected, since these are not normal times for the NRC or for our licensees,"" Jaczko said in a speech to the National Press Club.  After the Fukushima plant was overwhelmed by an earthquake and tsunami in March, causing the world's worst nuclear disaster in 25 years, the U.S. NRC moved quickly to evaluate whether its fleet of 104 reactors needed to make changes.  The report is being closely watched by nuclear operators like Exelon (EXC.N), Entergy (ETR.N), and PG&E (PCG.N).  A task force of senior staff members said last week there were no imminent safety risks at U.S. plants, but urged an overhaul of rules which could force plants to plan for catastrophes beyond what they were designed to withstand.  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   FACTBOX-What's in the task force report?

""I believe that is more than enough time for the Commission to outline a clear path forward,"" he said.  But first, Jaczko will need to convince a majority of the other appointed commissioners to agree to the timetable.  The commissioners have not yet spoken publicly about their opinions of the task force report, but are slated to discuss the issues at a public hearing on Tuesday.  ""We're not convinced the full commission will agree"" with the most significant shifts recommended, said Christine Tezak, an energy policy analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co, in a note to clients on Monday.  Asked whether he has the support he needs, Jaczko told the Press Club: ""Well, we'll see.""  Jaczko also warned that unless the regulator takes quick action in 90 days, it will not ""be appropriate"" to evaluate applications for new reactors proposed by Southern (SO.N) and SCANA (SCG.N) -- decisions that had been scheduled to be made in 2011.  ""We have to understand what they will mean for new reactor licenses. If we want to keep that moving forward at reasonable pace we have to first come to some decision and resolution with these recommendations,"" he said.  INDUSTRY WARNS MORE INPUT NEEDED  The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's lobby group, urged the regulator to get more information from Japan and to seek input from the industry before moving ahead.  ""The task force report lacks the rigorous analysis of issues that traditionally accompanies regulatory requirements proposed by the NRC,"" said Marvin Fertel, president of the group, in a July 15 letter to Jaczko.  If the NRC adopts all the recommendations, that could lead to more than $1 billion in new costs for the nuclear plants, estimated Nathan Ives, senior manager with Ernst & Young's Power & Utilities advisory practice.  But those costs would be unlikely to force any plants to shut down, said Ives, who formerly worked with the Institute of Nuclear Power Operation, the industry's self-regulatory body.  Republicans also warned the NRC to step carefully.  The House Energy and Commerce Committee said it is worried ""regular NRC procedures for full and deliberate review may be circumvented, depriving the commission of the full information necessary to properly do its work.""

13,SO,U.S. nuclear regulators question recommended reforms,"ROCKVILLE, Maryland (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. nuclear safety regulator wants a quick and sweeping overhaul of the rules governing the nuclear power industry but his fellow commissioners said on Tuesday they want to first hear from the industry and the public.  The first public comments from the four top officials at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission could mean Chairman Gregory Jaczko will face an uphill battle for his ambitious plan to rewrite the rule book within five years.  Jaczko wants the NRC to provide clear direction to industry on changes within 90 days on the rules that are being remade in response to Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power disaster. The regulator and industry would then implement the changes within five years.  A U.S. task force examining Fukushima — the worst nuclear accident in 25 years — recommended long-term changes for the NRC’s regulations, but did not find any immediate safety threats in the nation’s fleet of 104 reactors.  The changes would require a shift in NRC’s safety regime that would force plants to plan for catastrophes far beyond what they were originally designed to withstand.  “The task force recognizes that what we’ve recommended here is a lot to chew on,” said Charlie Miller, its chairman.  Jaczko sought to downplay the shift. “I don’t see this as that much of a change in our overall regulatory structure,” he said, pointing out that hardened vents are already used in plants similar to Fukushima and the commission already has rules regarding prolonged power outages — two issues touched on by the task force.  To make changes, Jaczko must secure votes from the majority of the four commissioners appointed to the NRC.  The commissioners did not directly address Jaczko’s timeline at a public meeting on Tuesday, but three of them stressed they wanted to hear from stakeholders such as the industry and the public.  Calling the report “an important, but early step,” Kristine Svinicki, a Republican commissioner, said the NRC needs to proceed with a “systematic and methodical review.”  The recommendations “must be open to challenge by our many stakeholders and tested by the scrutiny of a wider body of experts ... prior to final commission action,” Svinicki said.  William Magwood, a Democratic commissioner, called the report’s ideas “intriguing and challenging” but said he wants to hear from people outside the agency.  “We may not agree with everything they suggest, but it would be arrogant of us not to listen to them very closely and very carefully,” Magwood said.  William Ostendorff, a Republican commissioner, echoed calls for consultation. “I personally do not believe that our existing regulatory framework is broken,” he said.  NEW PLANTS COULD MOVE FORWARD-JACZKO  Jaczko on Monday warned a failure to decide on a path forward could hold up applications for new reactors proposed by Southern and SCANA — decisions that had been scheduled to be made in 2011.  But in a briefing with reporters on Tuesday, Jaczko clarified his comments. The commission could move forward on the applications, but that move would be hard to defend to the public without first acting on the task force, he said.  “If those issues are unresolved I think it would be very difficult for the commission to explain why we’re moving forward with new reactor licensing,” Jaczko said.  Jaczko also said he feels the NRC should rethink its original plan to embark on a six-month in-depth review, noting the commission could wait “a couple of months” until Japan’s situation becomes more clear.  Jaczko, a former Capitol Hill aide to two Democrats who have criticized the nuclear industry, often finds himself in the minority on NRC votes, said Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, for whom Jaczko once worked.  Markey said Jaczko’s fellow commissioners should be more supportive of safety reforms.  “I call on these commissioners to start doing their jobs, and act immediately to implement all measures recommended by the Fukushima task force instead of calling for endless additional study in the hopes of delaying their adoption indefinitely,” Markey said in a statement.  Other nuclear critics also urged the NRC on Tuesday to implement the changes as soon as possible, although they said some of the recommendations may not go far enough.

The first public comments from the four top officials at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission suggest that Chairman Gregory Jaczko faces an uphill battle for his ambitious plan to rewrite the rule book within five years.  Jaczko wants the NRC to provide clear direction to industry on changes within 90 days on the rules that are being remade in response to Japan's Fukushima nuclear power disaster. The regulator and industry would then implement the changes within five years.[ID:nN1E76H148]  A U.S. task force examining Fukushima -- the worst nuclear accident in 25 years -- recommended sweeping long-term changes for the NRC's regulations, but did not find any immediate safety threats to U.S. plants.  The changes would require a shift in NRC's safety regime that would force plants to plan for catastrophes far beyond what they were originally designed to withstand.  Some of the safety enhancements recommended by task force include tougher standards for back-up power supplies, back-up water supplies for pools holding plant waste, and improvements in reactors that share the same design as Japan's Fukushima Daiichi plant.  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   FACTBOX-What's in the task force report?

William Magwood, a Democratic commissioner, called the report's ideas ""intriguing and challenging"" but said he wants to hear from people outside the agency.

William Ostendorff, a Republican commissioner, echoed calls for consultation.  ""I personally do not believe that our existing regulatory framework is broken,"" Ostendorff said.  CRITICS URGE QUICK ACTION  The NRC's Chairman Jaczko has said he wants the commission to consider the recommendations in a series of public meetings.  On Monday, he warned that a failure to decide on a path forward could hold up applications for new reactors proposed by Southern (SO.N) and SCANA (SCG.N) -- decisions that had been scheduled to be made in 2011.  Critics of nuclear energy urged the NRC to implement the changes as soon as possible, although they said some of the recommendations may not go far enough.  ""We request that you set a deadline for the adoption of each recommendation, and take appropriate steps to ensure that robust public participation is an intrinsic element of this process,"" the group said in a letter signed by 15 groups, including Physicians for Social Responsibility, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and Greenpeace.

21,SO,UPDATE 2-Duke to buy interest in new South Carolina reactors," * Santee Cooper to sell 5 to 10 pct of capacity  * Scana, Santee Cooper await NRC license for new units  (Adds details)  NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - Duke Energy (DUK.N) on Wednesday told South Carolina regulators its Carolinas unit agreed to buy a potential minority interest in the new Summer nuclear power reactors under construction in South Carolina.  Duke signed a letter of intent with South Carolina-owned power generator Santee Cooper for 5 to 10 percent of the capacity of the two new 1,100-megawatt units, which would be among the first new reactors built in the United States in over 30 years, the company said in a release.  South Carolina power company Scana (SCG.N) and Santee Cooper have already started preparing the site for the two new Westinghouse AP1000 reactors at the companies’ 966-MW Summer nuclear plant while they wait for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue a construction and operating license.  Santee Cooper owns 45 percent of the new reactors and Scana owns the other 55 percent. The project will cost an estimated $10 billion to build.  Neither Duke nor Santee Cooper discussed financial terms of the agreement in their press releases.  In addition to exploring the Summer project, Duke said it continues work on development of its proposed Lee nuclear station in Cherokee County, South Carolina, and anticipates receiving its combined construction and operating license from the NRC in 2013.  Last month, Duke CEO Jim Rogers told Reuters the company was in talks with Santee Cooper about potentially buying a stake in the new Summer reactors. [ID:nN1573952]  SPREADING THE RISK  Rogers said he was a great believer in a few power companies partnering to build new nuclear plants to spread the risk and the cost of these multibillion dollar projects.  “Every nuclear plant should have two or three owners,” Rogers said.  Santee Cooper said in its release the letter of intent with Duke follows a March 2011 announcement Santee Cooper signed a letter of intent with Orlando Utilities Commission of Florida for a similar proportionate share of the capacity and output from Santee Cooper’s interest in the two new Summer reactors.  Santee Cooper said it decided to sell part of its interest in the new reactors because its customers no longer needed all the generation the units would produce after the recession slowed the company’s growth projections, among other things.  The NRC will likely approve of the Westinghouse AP1000 design later this year before issuing the construction and operating license for the Summer reactors by the end of the year or early in 2012, Santee Cooper has said.  Westinghouse Electric is majority owned by Japanese multinational conglomerate Toshiba (6502.T) and U.S. construction and engineering firm Shaw Group SHAW.N.  The NRC is also expected to approve of construction and operating licenses for Southern Co’s (SO.N) $14 billion project to add two new AP1000 reactors at the Vogtle nuclear site in Georgia later this year or early next year.  Together, the new reactors at Summer and Vogtle will be the first new nuclear plants built in the United States since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979.  The new Summer units are expected to enter service in 2016 and 2019. The new Vogtle units are expected to enter service in 2016 and 2017.

22,SO,Power companies see mixed economic picture,"NEW YORK/BANGALORE (Reuters) - Three top U.S. power companies posted higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday, but drew a mixed picture of the nation’s economic outlook and demand for electricity.  Exelon Corp (EXC.N), which operates the largest U.S. fleet of nuclear power plants, raised its full-year profit forecast based on results in the first half, when it relied on strong residential and small-business demand to offset weak electricity usage from industrial customers.  NextEra Energy (NEE.N), the largest U.S. renewable energy producer, said its earnings benefited from greater demand at its Florida Power & Light utility and stronger output from its wind farms, but warned of uncertainty ahead.  “The economic recovery in Florida appears to continue to take hold, but the progress is slow and uneven,” Chief Financial Officer Armando Pimentel Jr. told a conference call.  Still, Southern Co (SO.N), which is trying to build the first U.S. nuclear power reactor in decades, said demand had increased in its markets.  “The industrial sector continues to lead the economic recovery in the Southeast,” Chief Executive Thomas Fanning said in a release. “Our region is well-positioned for future expansion, and we are already seeing new business development in several parts of our service territory.”  The Atlanta-based company forecast third-quarter earnings of $1.02 a share and backed its full-year profit outlook of $2.48- $2.56 a share. Analysts were predicting a third-quarter profit of $1.07 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  “This industrial recovery is very broad-based, with all major segments except for the housing-related segments of stone, clay, and glass and textiles experiencing year-over-year growth,” Chief Financial Officer Art Beattie said on a conference call with analysts.  Southern’s second-quarter profit increased 18 percent to $603.3 million, while revenue rose 7 percent to $4.52 billion.  Exelon’s quarterly profit rose 39 percent to $620 million. The company, which is seeking regulatory approvals to buy Constellation Energy Group CEG.N, raised its full-year forecast to between $4.05 and $4.25 per share from a prior range of $3.90 to $4.20.  Exelon forecast no growth in 2011 overall power demand from customers of its PECO utility in Pennsylvania and Commonwealth Edison customers in Illinois, largely because of moribund demand from its largest users.  NextEra’s profit jumped 39 percent to $580 million, even though extended refueling outages at its Seabrook and Point Beach nuclear power plants cut into its earnings. Its shares fell 1.09 percent.  Shares of Exelon were up 1 percent while those of Southern recouped losses to turn positive.

27,SO,"New U.S. nuclear design, Vogtle units move forward","HOUSTON (Reuters) - Federal nuclear regulators have completed two safety reports that will allow the first new advanced nuclear power plant projects in the United States in three decades to move a step closer to reality, the agency said on Tuesday.  Westinghouse Electric said the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission will issue its final safety evaluation report for the amended AP1000 nuclear reactor design later this week after all technical issues were resolved.  The NRC action clears the way for the five-member commission to act on the final design certification needed before two U.S. utilities — Southern Co and SCANA Corp — can move forward with full-blown construction activity.  “We’re in the home stretch to receive final approval of the amended AP1000 design,” said Aris Candris, chief executive officer of Westinghouse Electric, which is majority owned by Toshiba Corp and Shaw Group.  “We’re happy that the NRC technical staff has approved the amended design and confident that the NRC commissioners will do the same so construction of AP1000 units can begin here in the U.S.,” Candris said in a statement.  Southern’s nuclear arm Tuesday also received the final safety evaluation report for its $14 billion proposed Vogtle 3 and 4 reactors in Georgia, the company said.  Three months ago, a delay in the AP1000 certification schedule seemed likely after NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko took the unusual step to issue a press release regarding unresolved technical issues between Westinghouse and the NRC staff.  Heightened concern about nuclear safety raised by Japan’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami that destroyed reactors at the Fukushima plant also boosted nuclear opponents’ criticism of the AP1000 design and the NRC process.  The NRC, however, has ignored calls to delay decisions on new reactor designs until its Fukushima safety review process is completed.  For Southern Co, the NRC’s final safety report sets the stage for a hearing on its construction and operating license (COL) in the next few months before the commission votes to issue a license late this year or early next year.  “This is a significant step forward in the licensing process for the Vogtle project,” said Thomas Fanning, Southern’s chief executive, in a statement.  Last month, Fanning told analysts that if the COL was not finalized by year-end, Southern would seek an alternative regulatory path, known as “limited work” authority, to maintain its ambitious construction timeline to bring the first new Vogtle reactor online in 2016.  Other companies that want to build Westinghouse AP1000 reactors are Duke Energy Corp, NextEra Energy Inc, Progress Energy Inc and the Tennessee Valley Authority.  While Japan’s nuclear accident is expected to raise regulatory and operating costs for existing and new U.S. reactors, the biggest obstacle for a U.S. nuclear revival is the low cost of natural gas and the high cost of building new reactors, analysts at Standard & Poor’s said in a report.

28,SO,Groups step up call for NRC delay after Fukushima,"HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - About two dozen environmental groups launched a volley of legal challenges at nuclear regulators on Thursday in an attempt to stall action to extend the operation of aging reactors and to delay construction of more advanced nuclear designs.  Using findings of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s own Fukushima task force as ammunition, the groups, representing anti-nuclear parties from coast to coast, made filings with the NRC claiming that existing federal law requires the agency to address safety concerns in the Fukushima review before moving forward.  “The NRC may not issue or renew a single reactor license until it has either strengthened regulations to protect the public from severe accident risks or until it has made a careful and detailed study of the environmental implications of not doing so,” the groups said in a statement, citing provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Atomic Energy Act.  NRC spokesman Scott Burnell said the agency will review the filings. “There is a well established process within the NRC for individuals or groups to raise legal challenges to NRC licensing activities,” Burnell said.  The latest filings echo arguments already raised by some of the regional environmental groups in the wake of the meltdown and release of radioactivity following the earthquake and tsunami that shattered Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in March.  The NRC commission has yet to respond to that petition asking the agency to suspend all new reactor and license renewal activity, Burnell said, and there is no timetable for commission action.  “So this is not the first time that people have suggested the events at Fukushima should in their view cause the agency to stop doing everything,” Burnell said.  To bolster their effort, the group’s latest strategy is to rely on findings released last month by the NRC’s Fukushima task force, said Jim Warren of NC Warn, a North Carolina group challenging new reactors proposed by Duke Energy and Progress Energy.  “The NRC’s own ‘A-Team’ of experts warns that severe accidents must be considered in the U.S.,” Warren said. “Federal law does not allow the NRC commissioners to ignore those warnings in order to accommodate the nuclear industry.”  Burnell countered that the task force report “states in no uncertain terms that current reactors are safe and appropriate to continue operating.”  The report recommended an overhaul of the way regulators require the nation’s 104 reactors to prepare for disasters like earthquakes and floods, but NRC commissioners have disagreed on how quickly the agency should move ahead on the recommendations.  On Wednesday, NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko chided current commissioners for their “reoccupation with process at the expense of nuclear safety policy.”  “What we’ve learned in the wake of Japan’s nuclear disaster — and what the NRC’s experts concluded — is that current regulations are fundamentally inadequate,” said Phillip Musegaas, Hudson Program Director of Riverkeeper Inc, which filed a challenge related to Entergy Corp’s Indian Point nuclear reactor in New York.  So far, the Fukushima disaster has not altered the NRC’s timeline to relicense older nuclear plants or to evaluate new reactor designs.  Since the March 11 earthquake, the NRC has relicensed nine older reactors, extending the operation of each by 20 years, and this week moved forward to certify the Westinghouse AP1000 nuclear design which developers plan to use to build the nation’s first new reactors in 30 years.  Any Fukushima-related changes deemed necessary to improve safety will be applied to all nuclear reactors, new or old, the NRC has said repeatedly.  Thursday’s filings seek to force the NRC to address safety concerns raised by Fukushima before deciding on all active requests for reactor relicensing, such as Indian Point and First Energy’s Davis-Besse reactor in Ohio, as well as the NRC’s AP1000 design certification process and applications for new reactor licenses, such as Southern Co’s Vogtle nuclear expansion in Georgia and SCANA Corp’s Summer plant expansion in South Carolina.  Other nuclear plants that were the target of the 19 filings are operated by Constellation Energy Group, Dominion Resources, DTE Energy, PG&E Corp, NRG Energy, Energy Future Holdings, Duke Energy, PPL Corp, Progress Energy, NextEra Energy and the Tennessee Valley Authority.

31,SO,House passes bill to block EPA clean air rules,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives passed a bill on Friday to block regulations that force industry to reduce unhealthy air emissions, such as mercury from coal-fired power plants, but the White House has promised to veto the measure and keep new clean air rules in place.  The vote was 249 to 169, largely along party lines.  Lawmakers in the Republican-controlled House have targeted Environmental Protection Agency air rules, saying they would kill jobs and burden businesses with billions of dollars in additional costs at the worst possible time.  “The Obama Administration is moving too fast and showing little regard for the economic consequences of their energy and environmental policies,” said Representative John Sullivan, who sponsored the bill.  The Transparency in Regulatory Analysis of Impacts on the Nation, or TRAIN, Act was also supported by less than 20 Democrats, most of them from coal and other energy-producing states.  The bill would also likely delay the EPA rule introduced in July that would cut smog and soot from coal-fired plants. That rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule, would add costs to power generators such as Southern Co, and American Electric Power, and would force coal-fired power plants in 27 states east of the Rocky Mountains to slash the amount of pollution they give off. The rule is slated to take effect in January.  The TRAIN Act, which must be passed in the Democratic-controlled Senate and signed by Obama to become law, would set up an interagency panel led by the Commerce Department to assess the impact of EPA rules on the economy.  Democrats in the Senate have promised to quash the bill. Even if they do, parts of the measure could reappear later in the year as part of a broad spending bill that Democrats would find hard to vote against.  With an eye to next year’s elections, Republicans will likely tout the House’s passage of the bill as evidence they tried to save American energy jobs.  Deliberations in the EPA review panel the bill sets up would delay several agency rules including regulations on mercury emissions slated to be laid out in November. The heavy metal accumulates in fish that can lead to neurological problems in people who consume them.  Environmentalists criticized TRAIN’s passage in the House, saying it would change the process for setting national air standards and lead to premature deaths from heart and lung illnesses.  “Sacrificing tens of thousands of American lives will not create more jobs,” said Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club. “Burdening the American people with billions of dollars in health bills will not lead to economic growth.”  ",9232011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-house-pollution/house-passes-bill-to-block-epa-clean-air-rules-idUSTRE78M5KD20110923

33,SO,GE calls for shut-down tests on reactors worldwide," * GE says problem could occur under limited conditions   * NRC says problem not an “immediate” safety issue   * Boiling-water design similar to GE reactors at Fukushima   By Jim Brumm   WILMINGTON, NC Sept 30 (Reuters) - GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy has warned operators of boiling water reactors (BWR) worldwide — including 35 in the U.S. — that the plants could fail to shut automatically during an earthquake, potentially risking the safety of the power plant.   In an event notification posted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission this week, GE Hitachi told nuclear operators to conduct tests to determine what conditions would prevent the reactors from shutting safely during an earth quake.   GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy is a venture between General Electric Co (GE.N) and Hitachi Limited (6501.T).   GE Hitachi spokesman Michael Tetuan said most nuclear plants could fix the problem by replacing fuel channels, if needed. A typical boiling water reactor has between 400 and 800 such channels.   The affected plants are of the same GE design as Japan’s Fukushima reactors which were crippled by an earthquake and tsunami in March.   GE said the probability of a reactor not shutting properly is very low. Because of the limited circumstances under which a unit might not shut automatically, NRC spokesman Scott Burnell said the issue “is not an immediate safety issue.”   He said GE’s notice is information the agency wants nuclear vendors to raise so that companies can respond.   Affected by the potential glitch are type 2-5 BWRs designed by General Electric and built between the late 1960s and the early 1990s.   In the U.S., 12 of those nuclear units are owned by Exelon Corp (EXC.N); five by Entergy Corp (ETR.N); and three by the Tennessee Valley Authority.   Other affected plants are owned by Constellation Energy Group CEG.N, Progress Energy PGN.N, Southern Co (SO.N), NextEra Energy (NEE.N), DTE Energy (DTE.N), Public Service Enterprise Group (PEG.N), PPL Inc (PPL.N), Xcel Energy XEL.N, Energy Northwest and the Nebraska Public Power District.   GE Hitachi identified the problem in July 2010 and reported to the NRC last September, months before an earthquake-spawned tsunami crippled GE reactors in Japan.   U.S. reactors included are Nine Mile Point Units 1 and 2; Fermi 2; Columbia; FitzPatrick; Pilgrim; Vermont Yankee; Grand Gulf; River Bend; Clinton; Oyster Creek; Dresden 2 and 3; LaSalle 1 and 2; Limerick 1 and 2; Peach Bottom 2 and 3; Quad Cities 1 and 2; Perry; Duane Arnold; Cooper; Monticello; Brunswick 1 and 2; Hope Creek; Hatch 1 and 2; and Browns Ferry 1, 2 and 3.   “We’ve proactively identified a very unique set of conditions in which a plant rarely operates where this is a concern,” Tetuan said. “With the guidance provided to our customers, they will be able to monitor potentially affected fuel channels and avoid a safety concern.”   Tetuan said the company also notified operators of BWRs located elsewhere.   The World Nuclear Association (WNA) website lists 53 BWRs outside the U.S., including 29 operating in Taiwan, Sweden, the Netherlands, Mexico, Japan, Italy, Germany and Finland.   The seven operating Japanese BWRs include Fukushima Daiichi 5 and 6 which were shut when the March earthquake hit.   GE Hitachi told the NRC the problem does not affect BWR/6 or ABWR - advanced boiling water reactor plants.

35,SO,UPDATE 2-Bombardier wins $296 mln British trains deal,"* Bombardier to supply 130 Electrostar carriages to Southern * Production to start in late 2012 * New carriages to enter service in December 2013 By Rhys Jones LONDON, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Bombardier, Britain’s last remaining train builder, has been awarded a 189-million-pound ($296 million) contract to supply 130 carriages to UK rail operator Southern. The deal should help ease the pain caused by Britain’s decision earlier this year to award a key rail contract to Germany’s Siemens AG, leading incumbent Bombardier to cut hundreds of jobs at its plant in Derby, central England. Canadian-owned Bombardier, whose British unit makes trains for use on the country’s railways, will build 130 of its new Electrostar rail carriages for Southern, which runs services in south London, Surrey, Sussex and Kent, Britain’s Department for Transport (DfT) said on Wednesday. “This deal for more than 100 new carriages is great news for rail passengers and brilliant news for Bombardier and Derby,” transport secretary Justine Greening said in a statement. “It lands Bombardier with a crucial train order and I look forward to Bombardier workers in Derby being among the winners of this important deal.” The DfT is providing 80 million pounds towards the new deal, which will see new carriages enter service in December 2013. “This is a significant project which emphasises the performance of Bombardier’s products in the UK,” said Paul Roberts, President of Bombardier Transportation, Services UK. “The new trains will be manufactured in the UK with initial production commencing in the latter half of 2012.” The DfT in June awarded a consortium led by Siemens a 1.4-billion-pound contract to build and maintain 1,200 carriages for the Thameslink cross-London railway. Earlier this month a committee of lawmakers said the process by which Britain reached that decision would be subject to an official review. Bombardier shares in Toronto, which have lost a fifth of their value in 2011, closed at 3.86 Canadian dollars on Dec. 23, their most recent day of trading, valuing the group at around 6.8 billion Canadian dollars.

36,SO,NRC approves first new nuclear plant in a generation,"ROCKVILLE, Maryland (Reuters) - Regulators on Thursday approved plans to build the first new nuclear power plant in the U.S. in more than 30 years, despite objections of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman, who cited safety concerns stemming from Japan’s 2011 Fukushima disaster. The NRC voted 4-1 to allow Atlanta-based Southern Co to build and operate two new nuclear power reactors at its existing Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia. The units will cost Southern and partners about $14 billion and enter service as soon as 2016 and 2017. The approval was cold comfort for nuclear industry officials who have touted a “renaissance” that has failed to materialize, undercut by high costs and the cheapest natural gas prices in about a decade. No nuclear power plants have been licensed in the United States since the partial meltdown of the reactor core of the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania in 1979. After the accident, the NRC adopted more stringent safety standards, which caused construction costs for nuclear plants to skyrocket and stopped dozens of planned plants in their tracks. Further clouding future prospects, NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko cast an extraordinary dissenting vote, citing the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in March 2011 that spurred the NRC to review whether existing and new U.S. reactors could withstand natural disasters like earthquakes and floods. “I cannot support issuing this license as if Fukushima never happened.” said Jaczko, who has close ties to congressional Democrats. “I believe it requires some type of binding commitment that the Fukushima enhancements that are currently projected and currently planned to be made would be made before the operation of the facility.” Supporters of nuclear power saw Jaczko’s dissent as another sign of dysfunction at the top of the NRC, where in-fighting among members has been the subject of Congressional hearings where one Democratic commissioner called Jaczko abusive. “The chairman just voted against the first new nuclear reactors in 30 years,” said Ed Batts, a partner at law firm DLA Piper. “That’s just not the way that confidence is inspired in the average American and thus does not seem like the best way for nuclear regulation.” The new plant will use AP1000 reactors built by Westinghouse Electric, a standardized design approved by the NRC in December that will be the foundation for several other proposed nuclear plants. Westinghouse is majority owned by Japanese multinational Toshiba Corp. Thomas Fanning, Southern Co.’s chief executive Officer, called the license a “monumental accomplishment” and said the new Vogtle plants would provide cheap, reliable power to Southeast residents for years to come. “This has been a thorough, thoughtful and complete process,” Fanning said. “Recall that four other commissioners saw the same facts and voted” to issue the license. However, Rep. Edward Markey of Massachusetts, a Democratic critic of the nuclear industry, said the agency “abdicated its duty to protect public health and safety, just to make construction faster and cheaper for the nuclear industry.” Fanning declined to say why Southern would not agree to include language in the new license to complete potential Fukushima modifications before the Vogtle reactors come online as Jaczko suggested. “There will be issues (from the Fukushima review) that apply to the U.S. nuclear fleet, but they apply much more closely to the current fleet, not this newest generation of nuclear technology,” Fanning said. The Obama administration has offered Southern and its partners $8.3 billion in federal loan guarantees as an incentive. Fanning said he expects the U.S. Energy Department to finalize the loan in the second quarter of 2012. Southern’s Vogtle project is the first in a queue of permits filed by U.S. utilities, like Scana Corp. These were once expected to usher in a “renaissance” of nuclear power, which now accounts for about 20 percent of U.S. electric generation. Interest in building new nuclear plants had risen about a decade ago when natural gas prices were soaring and experts thought the U.S. Congress would begin to place limits on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Between the fall of 2007 and the summer of 2009, 13 companies applied for construction and operating licenses to build 25 new reactors, including units of Southern, Scana Corp, Exelon, Duke Energy, NRG Energy, Progress Energy, Dominion Resources, NextEra Energy and Energy Future Holdings. But the case for widespread U.S. nuclear plant construction has eroded due to abundant natural gas supplies, slow electricity demand growth in a weak U.S. economy, lack of financing and uncertainty following the Fukushima disaster. Nuclear industry officials now say they expect just five new reactors to enter service by 2020 — Southern’s two Vogtle reactors, two at Summer in South Carolina and one at Watts Bar in Tennessee, to be built by the federally owned Tennessee Valley Authority. Earlier this week, TVA said the Watts Bar unit was behind schedule and that costs would “significantly exceed” a previous building cost estimate of $2.5 billion. New nuclear plants are “more questionable because there are economic factors right now which favor gas-fueled power plants and the fact that the economy is only growing slowly means that nationally the need for new generation is lower than people were expecting in 2007,” said Michael Golay, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A 1,000-megawatt natural gas plant takes a few years to permit and build and costs up to $1 billion for the most efficient, combined-cycle model. A similar-sized nuclear reactor however could take five to 10 years to develop and build and cost more than $5 billion. Industry experts say building interest is centered in Southeast states like Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia, Alabama and Florida, where traditional utility regulation offers companies the best chance to make a profit on the sizable investment needed to develop new reactors. Southern Co. stock closed at $44.68 per share, nearly unchanged from the previous day.

42,SO,Analysis: U.S. nuclear industry's fate rests with Southern Co,"NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - The future of U.S. nuclear power rests squarely on the shoulders of Atlanta-based Southern Co, which will lead the industry’s effort to prove the concept of new reactor construction after a 30-year hiatus. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on February 9 voted 4-1 to issue Southern a permit to build and operate two units at its existing Vogtle plant in eastern Georgia. These were the first U.S. permits issued since 1978, a year before the partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania cast a pall over the industry and halted plans for dozens of plants. Government officials and Wall Street financiers will watch Southern closely for evidence that utilities can maneuver through a complex construction schedule and avoid cost overruns like those that plagued the last wave of U.S. reactor building in the 1970s and 1980s. One early challenge — a lawsuit by anti-nuclear power groups — is expected on Thursday. “The Vogtle project has a huge burden on its back to show we can do this on time,” said Edward Kee, vice president of NERA Economic Consulting, a unit of Marsh & McLennan. “That’s the next hurdle for them.” The two new advanced AP1000 reactors, manufactured by Toshiba Corp unit Westinghouse Electric, will cost Southern and its partners $14 billion and enter service as soon as 2016 and 2017. Twelve public interest groups on Thursday are expected to file suit challenging the Vogtle permit on grounds that the NRC has not heeded lessons from Japan’s Fukushima accident last year, the worst since the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986. Any delay caused by legal challenges could result in cost overruns totaling millions or even billions of dollars. Southern and partners have already spent more than $4 billion on major components at the Vogtle site and await final approval of an $8.3 billion federal loan guarantee. “The license may be granted, but these reactors are far from a done deal,” said Damon Moglen at Friends of the Earth, one of the environmental groups joining the legal challenge. “As in the past, expect delays and cost overruns.” Southern will try to avoid a replay of the delays and ballooning costs that beset the two existing reactors at Vogtle when they were built. Original estimates put those costs at $660 million when proposed in the early 1970s. But they ended up costing more than $8 billion by the time they entered service in the late 1980s. Much of the increase was due to required safety upgrades after the Three Mile Island accident. Southern Chief Executive Thomas Fanning said he was confident the company could overcome any lawsuit challenging the license since the issues the environmental groups will likely raise have already been heard and decided by the NRC. William Jacobs, the independent construction manager reporting to the Georgia Public Service Commission, has testified that completing the Vogtle units in 2016 and 2017 will be a challenge for Southern and its partners. In a twice-yearly report, Jacobs said the April 2016 timeline for commercial operation of Vogtle 3 has already slipped by five months and could slip further as installation of the first rebar for the Vogtle 3 nuclear island had to be delayed until the NRC approved the license. “Given the (construction) consortium’s continued inability to meet scheduled milestones to date leads me to question the consortium’s ability to complete a significant portion of the schedule faster than originally planned,” Jacobs said in testimony filed in early December. A longer construction period could increase Vogtle’s financing costs and potential change orders already identified “could significantly impact the direct construction cost of the project,” Jacobs said. “Until the magnitude of these costs associated with these potential change orders and the responsibility for these costs is known, the forecast cost for the project is unknown,” Jacobs said. Southern’s Fanning said, “The project is on track, and our targets related to cost and schedule are achievable.” Georgia’s utility regulators have approved Vogtle construction costs as recently as February 10, the day after the NRC voted to issue the license. The industry touted a nuclear “renaissance” in the early 2000s amid high oil and natural gas prices and as the U.S. Congress appeared likely to begin limiting carbon emissions, placing a premium on carbon-free nuclear generation. But with no carbon regulations are in sight and power companies attracted to natural gas, whose price is near 10-year lows due to record production of shale gas, few utilities are willing to make billion-dollar bets on nuclear power. Even the Nuclear Energy Institute, the nuclear trade group, expects only a handful of new reactors to enter service by 2020, including the two at Vogtle and another two AP1000s at power company Scana Corp’s Summer plant in South Carolina, which is expected to get an NRC license later this year. Other power companies like Duke Energy, Progress Energy and NextEra Energy are seeking federal licenses to build new reactors but don’t expect to complete anything until the next decade. Nuclear capacity in the United States will grow by an estimated 10 gigawatts by 2035, according to federal energy data, but its share of total generation will likely fall. A gigawatt can power about a million homes. The Vogtle project is “an important test of the nuclear industry’s ability to bring a new reactor online in a timely, cost-effective, and safe manner,” said Joe Romm of the Center for American Progress, a think tank. “How they meet this challenge will impact how other utilities, regulators, policymakers and consumers feel about more nuclear investments.” ",2162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-utilities-southern-nuclear/analysis-u-s-nuclear-industrys-fate-rests-with-southern-co-idUSTRE81F2AX20120216

44,SO,UPDATE 1-US groups file suit to block Southern Vogtle reactors,"* New Vogtle reactors to cost about $14 billion * NRC issued Vogtle reactor license last week * NRC chairman voted against new reactor license By Scott DiSavino Feb 16 (Reuters) - Public interest groups filed suit against Southern Co in federal court on Thursday to block the license that U.S. regulators issued last week for the country’s first new nuclear reactors in more than 30 years at the Vogtle power plant in Georgia. Nine groups sued in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, alleging that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) violated federal law by issuing the Vogtle license without considering public safety and environmental implications of last year’s Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan. The suit asks federal judges to order the NRC to prepare a new environmental impact statement on the proposed reactors. The NRC said it already has conducted a lengthy study that addressed the issues raised in the lawsuit. Last week, the NRC voted 4-1 to issue Southern a permit to build and operate two units at Vogtle - the first permits issued in the United States since 1978, a year before the partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania that cast a pall over the nuclear industry and halted plans for dozens of plants. But NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko gave opponents some ammunition by casting an extraordinary dissenting vote, citing the Fukushima nuclear disaster that spurred the NRC to review whether existing and new U.S. reactors could withstand natural disasters like earthquakes and floods. “I cannot support issuing this license as if Fukushima never happened,” said Jaczko, who has close ties to congressional Democrats. “I believe it requires some type of binding commitment that the Fukushima enhancements that are currently projected and currently planned to be made would be made before the operation of the facility.” Southern spokesman Steve Higginbottom told Reuters: “We are confident that the (NRC) fully complied with federal regulatory requirements in approving and issuing the license and see no cause to delay construction.” “Further, the NRC ... already rejected these groups’ contentions relating to the NRC’s analysis of Fukushima and we do not believe there is valid justification to stay the (license),” Higginbottom said. “We look forward to working with the (NRC) to incorporate lessons learned from Fukushima into the construction and operation of Vogtle 3 and 4 (the new reactors).” Higginbottom also noted the NRC’s Fukushima 90-day Task Force found the AP1000 already met most of its recommendations. Southern and partners expect to spend about $14 billion to build the two 1,100-megawatt Westinghouse AP1000 reactors with the units entering service in 2016 and 2017. The lawsuit was filed by groups including Friends of the Earth, Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League and North Carolina Waste Awareness and Reduction Network (NC WARN). The public interest groups also said Georgia ratepayers and U.S. taxpayers would be on the hook if Westinghouse and the construction team could not build the reactors on time and on budget. Westinghouse Electric is majority-owned by Japanese multinational Toshiba Corp. “U.S. taxpayers need to brace themselves for some bad news if they are put on the hook for any ill-considered ‘investment’ in the Vogtle reactors. Taxpayers and Southern Co’s customers are sitting ducks for serial cost overruns and soaring power bills,” Jim Warren, executive director of NC WARN said in a statement. In defense of the project, Westinghouse spokesman Scott Shaw said the NRC has already rejected these groups’ contention relating to its analysis of Fukushima and there is no valid reason to delay or stay the license for the new reactors. Shaw also noted Georgia regulators just last week voted 5-0 to approve of Southern Co’s Georgia Power unit’s spending on the new Vogtle reactors and financing cost of the project were $60 million under budget.",2162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-southern-vogtle-lawsuit/update-1-us-groups-file-suit-to-block-southern-vogtle-reactors-idUSL2E8DGBYL20120216

47,SO,Southern unit to proceed with costly coal project,"HOUSTON, March 16 (Reuters) - Southern Co’s  Mississippi utility will continue building a $2.8 billion coal-gasification power plant in Kemper County despite a state supreme court ruling that overturned the plant’s legal certification, the utility said on Friday. On Thursday, the Mississippi Supreme Court, in a 9-0 vote, rejected the Mississippi Public Service Commission’s May 2010 approval of the Kemper project, saying the commission failed to show that the plant would benefit the utility’s customers as required by state law. The court sent the case back to the PSC. Southern Co’s smallest utility, Mississippi Power, began building the 582-megawatt integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) power plant in late 2010. Mississippi Power said it hoped the commission would address the ruling quickly. “We are confident there is substantial evidence in the record to support the commission’s approval of the certificate,” said Mississippi Power spokesman Jeff Shepard in a statement. “We intend to continue construction of this facility to provide our customers with a sound energy future and unlock the facility’s substantial customer benefits,” Shepard said.",3162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-mississippi-kemper/southern-unit-to-proceed-with-costly-coal-project-idUSL2E8EGEOV20120316
48,SO,UPDATE 1-Miss. Supreme Court reverses Southern Co coal project approval,"By Eileen O’Grady HOUSTON, March 15 (Reuters) - The Mississippi Supreme Court on Thursday reversed an approval for a Southern Co  $2.8 billion coal gasification project in Mississippi. In a 9-0 vote, the state supreme court said the Mississippi Public Service Commission’s May 2010 approval failed to satisfy state law that the plant would benefit the utility’s customers, and sent the case back to the PSC. Southern’s smallest utility, Mississippi Power, is already building the 582-megawatt integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) power plant, which has been awarded more than $680 million in federal grants and tax incentives, including $270 million from the U.S. Department of Energy’s clean coal power initiative. The ruling “has dealt a severe blow to the project in the sense that they (Mississippi Power) are back to square one,” said Louie Miller, state director at the Sierra Club, which challenged the PSC certificate to build the plant. Mississippi Power officials said late Thursday that they were reviewing the court ruling and declined further comment. The PSC will now have to take another look at the Kemper Country plant, said attorney Robert Wiygul, who represented the Sierra Club. “It’s going to be very difficult for an unbiased observer to say that this plant is a good idea given the current state of the energy market, the natural gas market and the economy,” Wiygul said. In 2010, the three-member PSC initially ruled that Mississippi Power failed to prove that the costly plant would benefit the utility’s small customer base of less than 200,000. Mississippi Power indicated that the $2.4 billion price cap imposed on the project by the commission would make it impossible to finance or construct the plant. About a month later, however, the commission voted 2-1 to allow Mississippi Power to build the plant under revised conditions that included raising the price cap by nearly $500 million to $2.88 billion. The Sierra Club called the second vote “an unprecedented flip-flop.” Brandon Presley, the lone Mississippi commissioner who voted against the Kemper project both times, called Thursday’s Supreme Court ruling “a major victory for each and every customer of Mississippi Power Co and deals a serious blow to the company’s corporate socialism.” “This plant is untried technology,” Presley said in a statement. “The shareholders have no risks while the customers have all the risks along with a 45 percent rate hike to boot.” IGCC technology heats coal to convert it into a synthesis gas that is processed to remove sulfur, mercury and other pollutants before being sent to a traditional combined cycle power plant to produce electricity. The plant was designed to use a gasification technology developed by Southern Co to burn Mississippi lignite and had support from state economic development groups and then-Governor Haley Barbour. A number of IGCC projects have been canceled due to technical problems, high capital costs and a lack of federal regulation to limit carbon dioxide emissions.",3162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/southernco-coal/update-1-miss-supreme-court-reverses-southern-co-coal-project-approval-idUSL2E8EFCBJ20120316
49,SO,State OKs Georgia Power plan to shut coal plants,"* Commission voted 4-1 to retire plants * Georgia Power approved to buy replacement power March 20 (Reuters) - Georgia utility regulators on Tuesday approved a request from Southern Co’s Georgia Power unit to retire about 600 megawatts of oil and coal-fired generation in the state and to buy replacement power from other Southern-owned power plants beginning in 2015. The Georgia Public Service Commission voted 4-1 to allow Georgia Power to shut two coal units, totaling 569 megawatts (MW), at the Branch in Putnam County by the end of 2013 and a small oil-fired unit at Plant Mitchell this year due to more stringent air pollution regulations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the PSC said in a statement. Georgia Power and other utilities are working to reduce their reliance on coal-fired generation. U.S. companies have announced plans to shut or retire more than 30,000 MW of coal units rather than invest in costly pollution control equipment. Weak power demand and low natural gas prices also hurt the economics of older coal plants that may not meet new EPA standards. Southern Co, which operates utilities in four states, said coal’s share of its energy mix fell to 49 percent last year, from about 67 percent five years ago. Natural gas use jumped to 28 percent from 13 percent. Regulators also approved Georgia Power’s plan to replace the lost oil and coal generation with 15-year power purchase contracts totaling 998 MW from three natural gas-fired power plants operated by Southern Power Co, an unregulated Southern Co unit, in 2015. The PSC rejected a fourth power contract sought by Georgia Power for another 564 MW from an Alabama power plant operated by an independent company. In addition to the cost of the purchased power, Georgia Power will be able to recover an additional $2.30 per kilowatt-hour per year from customers beginning in 2019 under a state law. “The purpose of the additional sum is to encourage the company to seek long-term power purchases in lieu of self-build projects,” the PSC said in a statement. Commissioner Tim Echols, the lone vote against the proposal, said the Georgia Power request “provides too much reserve margin at too high a price.” “It is a policy decision,” Echols said on Twitter. “With a large reserve margin, it eliminates the need to purchase power from independent power producers.” The Georgia PSC also approved the utility’s request to add pollution controls at four coal-fired units at Plant Bowen totaling about 3,100 MW; two coal units at Plant Wansley, totaling 926 MW; and four coal units at Plant Hammond, totaling 800 MW.",3202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-power-georgia/state-oks-georgia-power-plan-to-shut-coal-plants-idUSL1E8EKPL820120320
50,SO,Mississippi allows Southern Co to keep building $2.8 billion coal plant,"(Reuters) - Mississippi utility regulators on Friday voted to allow a unit of Southern Co to continue building an $2.8 billion coal-gasification power plant in the state despite a court ruling that overturned the existing certificate issued two years ago. With only two days meeting notice and no discussion, the Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC) voted 2-1 to issue a temporary certificate so that Southern Co’s smallest utility, Mississippi Power, can keep building the 582-megawatt integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) power plant in Kemper County, according to the commission order. The Sierra Club, which successfully challenged the Kemper IGCC project, immediately filed an appeal at the Mississippi Supreme Court to block the certificate. The PSC order, supported by commissioner chairman Leonard Bentz and commissioner Lynn Posey, stated that the halting the project would lead to “unnecessary costs” that would cause substantial injury to the utility and its customers. According to a state filing, Mississippi Power said interrupting construction at the Kemper site could cost between $250 million and $500 million. “Any delays to this project would mean significant costs to our customers,” said Jeff Shepard, Mississippi Power spokesman in a release. “Today’s ruling means we can continue building a sound energy future for our customers.” The Kemper certificate, issued by the PSC in May 2010, was thrown into doubt earlier this month when the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that the commission failed to show evidence that the plant would benefit the utility’s customers as required by state law. The court sent the case back to the PSC. [ID:nL2E8EGETM] Commissioner Brandon Presley who has consistently opposed the Kemper project for its high price tag and untried technology called Friday’s action to issue a temporary certificate “squarely contrary to state law.” In his dissent, Presley said the order “totally misinterprets” the state statute “to Mississippi Power’s advantage and to the detriment of MPC’s customers.” “There is no way allowing construction to continue at Kemper is a temporary act,” Presley told Reuters. “Nobody with any sense would argue that. It’s not what the law says.” Bentz who represents most Mississippi Power customers in the southeast corner of the state, declined to comment through a spokeswoman while Posey, who represents Kemper County in central Mississippi, could not be reached late Friday. “It’s an absolute bailout of Mississippi Power,” said Louie Miller, director of the Sierra Club in Mississippi. In its appeal filed after Friday’s meeting, the Sierra Club asked the Supreme Court to rule that “Mississippi Power is not exempt from the law, and the Public Service Commission does not have the authority to bypass state law, according to a statement. Miller suggested that Mississippi Power customers would be better served if Mississippi Power converted the plant to run natural gas rather than lignite as gas prices have fallen dramatically since Kemper County was proposed several years ago. According to state filings, Mississippi Power has spent more than $1.1 billion on the Kemper County IGCC plant and has committed to contracts valued at $1.5 billion. It is expected to begin producing power in 2014. The utility has less than 200,000 customers. Kemper opponents, including independent power producers, said Mississippi Power could only justify customer savings by using a natural gas scenario that projected gas prices would rise from $11 per million British thermal units in 2014 to $22 per mmBtu in 2050. U.S. gas prices are the lowest in a decade due to booming output from shale-rock formations. IGCC technology heats coal to convert it into a synthesis gas that is processed to remove numerous pollutants before being sent to a traditional combined-cycle power plant to produce electricity. Kemper was designed to showcase a gasification technology developed by another Southern Co subsidiary to burn Mississippi lignite and had support from state economic development groups and then-Governor Haley Barbour.

Without comment, the Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC) voted 2-1 for the certificate so that Southern Co’s smallest utility, Mississippi Power, could build the 582-megawatt integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) power plant in Kemper County, according to a webcast of the meeting. “We are pleased the process is moving forward,” said Mississippi Power spokesman Jeff Shepard in an email. The Sierra Club challenged the Kemper IGCC project in court, questioning its high cost and requested that the commission reopen the case in light of the dramatic drop in natural gas prices since the initial certificate was issued nearly two years ago. Sierra Club officials called the PSC action “yet another bailout at the expense of the ratepayer.” Tuesday’s revised PSC order was supported by PSC Chairman Leonard Bentz and Commissioner Lynn Posey and opposed by Commissioner Brandon Presley, who filed a dissenting opinion. The two commissioners who voted for the project “refused again to listen to the public or even consider the hard facts on Kemper,” said Louie Miller, state Sierra Club director, in a statement. The 133-page revised order keeps a soft cost cap of $2.4 billion on the Kemper project and a “hard cap” of $2.88 billion, said commission counsel Shawn Shurden. No cost can be recovered above $2.8 billion, “prudent or not,” Shurden told the commission. That figure however does not include costs to build the adjacent lignite mine or the pipeline to carry carbon dioxide produced by the plant. The commission said it was aware of changing gas prices and did not need to reopen the record on Kemper because the commission has an independent monitor overseeing construction. “By this order, we make explicit what was implicit in our previous orders: the Kemper County IGCC Project, given its low, stable fuel prices, its overall economics, and its significant contribution to preserving a reasonable level of fuel diversity for (Mississippi Power’s) generation portfolio satisfies the commission’s preference for a long-term baseload resource that will provide reliable service to (the utility’s) customers for the next 40 years,” the order states. In a 9-0 ruling, the Mississippi Supreme Court vacated the Kemper certificate issued by the PSC in mid-2010 saying the commission failed to show evidence that the plant would benefit the utility’s customers as required by state law. The court sent the case back to the PSC which issued a “temporary” certificate March 30. The commission’s lone dissenter, Presley said reopening the case to consider gas prices, cost overruns, environmental risk, the gasification technology and other topics would have been appropriate given the Supreme Court’s action. “Many of these issues cannot be addressed by the commission’s independent monitoring processes alone,” Presley wrote. “Supplementing the record with additional testimony and evidence is consistent with the court’s order and is an appropriate response to the court’s reversal and remand.” According to state filings, Mississippi Power has so far spent more than $1 billion on the Kemper County IGCC plant and another $109 million on the related lignite mine. Kemper is expected to begin producing power in 2014. Mississippi Power has less than 200,000 customers and the rate impact of the Kemper plant on customer bills has not been disclosed. Mississippi Power’s parent, Atlanta-based Southern Co, has 4.4 million customers in four states. Southern is scheduled to release its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. IGCC technology heats coal to convert it into a synthesis gas that is processed to remove numerous pollutants before being sent to a traditional combined-cycle power plant to produce electricity. Kemper was designed to showcase a gasification technology developed by another Southern Co subsidiary to burn Mississippi lignite and had support from state economic development groups and then-Governor Haley Barbour.",4242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-southern-kemper/update-2-state-re-issues-certificate-for-southerns-kemper-coal-plant-idUSL2E8FOEBH20120424
54,SO,Mississippi re-issues certificate for Southern's coal plant,"April 24 (Reuters) - Mississippi utility regulators on Tuesday re-issued a certificate vacated last month by the state supreme court to keep construction of Southern Co’s $2.8 billion coal-gasification power plant in Kemper County moving forward.

No cost can be recovered above $2.8 billion, “prudent or not,” Shurden told the commission. Those costs however, do not include costs to build the adjacent lignite mine or the pipeline to carry carbon dioxide produced by the plant. “The commission finds that a 20 percent cost cap above the commission-approved capital cost estimate constitutes a reasonable protection for customers against construction cost increases, while allowing for reasonable deviations from the original cost estimate so as not to unduly punish the company,” the PSC said in its order. Mississippi Power Jeff Shepard said the utility was pleased with the order. “We are pleased the process is moving forward,” Shepard said in an email. Shurden said the commission declined to reopen the case, citing the earlier record and the commission’s “preference” for lignite fuel which it believed would have more price certainty than natural gas over the 40-year life of the power plant. The Kemper certificate, issued by the PSC in May 2010, was vacated last month by the Mississippi Supreme Court which ruled 9-0 that the commission failed to show evidence that the plant would benefit the utility’s customers as required by state law.

55,SO,"Southern boosts natgas use 40 pct, coal down 20 pct","HOUSTON, April 25 (Reuters) - Southern Co utilities will burn 40 percent more natural gas this year than last to take advantage of the lowest gas prices in a decade, and pare coal use by 20 percent, executives said on Wednesday. Southern Co Chief Executive Tom Fanning said the company’s four utilities are projected to burn more than 600 billion cubic feet of gas this year, up from 430 bcf last year and nearly three times the amount used in 2007 when Southern’s coal use was at its peak. “Southern’s gas purchases now account for more than 2 percent of all U.S. gas consumption, making us the third-largest user of natural gas among U.S. utilities,” Fanning said on a call with analysts. Coal burned this year will fall to about 45 million tons at Southern utilities, Fanning said, down from 56 million tons last year and the nearly 80 million tons burned in 2007. Overall, gas is projected to account for 47 percent of Southern’s fuel mix in 2012, while coal’s share will likely slip to 35 percent and nuclear generation will hold steady at 18 percent, Fanning said. That compares with a 16 percent share for gas in 2007 and a 70 percent share for coal, he said. If gas prices remain low, Fanning said, the fuel could grow to 57 percent of Southern’s fuel mix. Southern has about 43,000 megawatts of generation across the Southeast. The first of three new gas-fired units at Plant McDonough-Atkinson, rated at 840 MW, came online late last year, and two more units will begin commercial operation in April and November, Fanning said. As the utilities reduce coal use, they will remain flexible should gas prices rise, Fanning said. The companies are working to match coal purchases to utility need, to maximize onsite and offsite coal storage, defer purchases and renegotiate coal and rail contracts when possible. Fanning said cost and schedule targets “remain achievable” for the company’s two major construction projects — the $14 billion nuclear units at Plant Vogtle in Georgia and a $2.8 billion advanced-coal plant in Mississippi. He said the Department of Energy has recently proposed new conditions for the $8.3 billion loan guarantee granted to the partners building Vogtle on a conditional basis two years ago. “We still remain hopeful we’ll have loan guarantees, but as a matter of course since Solyndra the DOE has proposed some new conditions that really relate to project finance conditions rather than corporate credit,” Fanning said. “We are working through those issues and hope we will reach a successful conclusion.” Should the agency “ask us to do something that is not in the customers’ interest, we won’t go forward,” Fanning added. Mississippi regulators on Tuesday reissued a certificate to allow construction to continue at the integrated gasification combined-cycle power plant in Kemper County. Southern reported first-quarter earnings of $368 million, or 42 cents per share, down from $422 million, or 50 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter, due to a warmer-than-normal winter. Revenue fell 10 percent to $3.6 billion from $4.01 billion as power sales fell 5 percent, according to the company.

56,SO,"Southern, Duke push US coal gasification; others quit","* Gasification seen preserving coal as electric fuel * Technology challenged by costly construction, cheap gas * Duke IGCC project to raise Indiana rates 14 percent By Eileen O’Grady HOUSTON, June 12 (Reuters) - Only two U.S. electric utilities are building expensive coal-gasification power plants, while dozens of similar facilities have been scrapped and some remaining projects may eliminate coal in favor of abundant, cheap natural gas. Duke Energy’s 618-megawatt Edwardsport coal project in Indiana and Southern Co’s 582-MW Kemper County project in Mississippi are the only “integrated gasification combined cycle”, or IGCC plants, under construction out of more than three dozen proposed in the United States over the last decade. Of the handful of other IGCC projects still in development, two are looking at switching to gas as the primary fuel and dropping coal — at least for now. The power industry cited gasification technology as a way to save coal’s role as the dominant fuel in electric generation as federal limits on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions appeared imminent, but the technology was unable to gain traction in the face of high capital costs, carbon legislation delay and rising supplies of natural gas. IGCC plants face a “host of issues”, starting with high construction costs, said Gary Stiegel, director of major projects at the Energy Department’s National Energy Technology Laboratory, which supports clean-coal technology. With only two plants being built, Duke and Southern “need to show that they are able to start up and achieve their production capacity within a reasonable time,” Stiegel said. IGCC technology employs a chemical process that converts coal into a synthesis gas, using steam and pressure. The so-called “syngas” can be stripped of impurities, then burned in a gas turbine to produce electricity. IGCC also offers the ability to capture emissions — such as heat-trapping CO2 — for storage or other use. The Environmental Protection Agency in March proposed its first rules to reduce CO2 from future coal-fired plants by requiring them to capture and store emissions. “That will add additional expense to these projects,” Stiegel said. High construction costs and technical glitches dogged the nation’s first three IGCC projects in the 1990s. Only two still run: TECO Energy’s 250-megawatt Polk County IGCC in Florida and the 260-MW Wabash River Power Station in Indiana, operated by Duke. As prospects dimmed for carbon legislation, gas prices declined while shale production rose and recession eroded the need for new generation, many of the nearly 20,000 MW of proposed IGCCs were abandoned with little fanfare. American Electric Power, which once touted IGCC as a “critical” technology for the nation, is no longer pursuing an ambitious plan to build three IGCC plants in the Midwest. NRG Energy, Xcel Energy, ConocoPhillips  and a utility owned by Berkshire Hathaway’s  MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co have also dropped IGCC plans. Even TECO and Southern backed away from developing larger IGCC projects in Florida as coal fell out of favor there. In 2008, after a long site-selection process, FutureGen, the industry’s showcase IGCC plant featuring carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), lost Energy Department financial support due to soaring cost estimates. A revised FutureGen 2.0 project will not include coal gasification. Now, the lowest gas prices in a decade make it even harder for companies to justify IGCC’s costs for the ratepayers that must pay the tab. “One challenge to moving this type of project forward is capital costs,” Stiegel said. “Another big issue is getting financing. They are expensive and not many IGCCs have been built, so the financial markets are concerned.” Duke’s Edwardsport IGCC project is expected to produce power by year-end. Cost overruns have boosted its price tag to $3.3 billion from early estimates of less than $2 billion. Under a settlement proposed to satisfy consumer groups, Duke’s Indiana customers will pay just 79 percent of Edwardsport’s price tag. That will limit the rate increase on Duke’s 790,000 customers in Indiana to 14.5 percent, down from 22 percent without the settlement, the utility said. Construction at the IGCC project run by Southern’s Mississippi Power Co continues despite an ongoing legal challenge by the Sierra Club. After initially capping Kemper’s cost at $2.4 billion, a divided Mississippi Public Service Commission raised the amount that the utility can recover from its 190,000 customers to a maximum of $2.88 billion. In the most recent monthly update, Mississippi Power said it had spent or committed $1.5 billion to the Kemper project, which was running $366 million over the initial budget. Southern also disclosed a $1.7 million consulting contract with Anthony Topazi, the former Mississippi Power president whom Southern credits for obtaining state approval of Kemper. Topazi, 62, who was promoted to chief operating officer at the parent company two months after regulators initially approved Kemper, said he will retire on Aug. 1. Expected to be operational in 2014, the Kemper County IGCC plant will showcase technology developed by another Southern unit, along with KBR Inc and the DOE, called Transport Integrated Gasification, or TRIG, which can be used to gasify lower-quality coal such as the lignite in Mississippi. In 2009, Southern licensed the TRIG technology to a Chinese utility. KBR presentations say the technology has “huge potential” in China, India, Australia and Indonesia, countries with large supplies of lower-quality coal. Meanwhile, a handful of IGCC projects remain active, but some have decided to join the natural gas trend, rather than buck it. Calgary-based EmberClear will use gas, rather than coal, to fuel its 300-MW Good Spring plant in northeastern Pennsylvania, dropping the IGCC component for now. “Lack of regulatory clarity on emissions for coal-based electricity plants plus the immediate availability of natural gas provides a strong incentive to use natural gas as the primary fuel source,” EmberClear said in a release. “This modification lowers the project complexity, reduces the capital cost by at least 60 percent and accelerates the construction schedule.” Tenaska, which has been working to develop the Taylorville IGCC project in Illinois for several years, may build a gas-fired power plant and defer the gasification component, the Nebraska-based independent power producer said. “The concept would be to wait until a subsequent legislative approval after economic conditions for gasification improve,” said Bart Ford, Tenaska’s vice president for development. Other active IGCC projects include Summit Energy’s 400-MW Texas Clean Energy project, Hydrogen Energy California in Kern County and ERORA’s 770-MW Cash Creek IGCC in Kentucky.",6122012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-coal-gasification/southern-duke-push-us-coal-gasification-others-quit-idUSL1E8H78P420120612
57,SO,UPDATE 1-Mississippi rejects Southern Co coal plant rate request,"* Rate hike to have reduced interest costs over time * Kemper project cost now 15 percent over initial budget * Only two U.S. utilities building IGCC plants; others scrapped By Eileen O’Grady June 22 (Reuters) - Mississippi utility regulators on Friday denied a $55 million rate increase request linked to financing costs for Southern Co’s $2.88 billion coal-gasification power plant under construction in Kemper County, Mississippi. In a move that drew applause from dozens of citizens attending the hearing, the Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC) voted to deny any rate increase related to the Kemper County plant, a 582-megawatt integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) project, until a legal challenge from the Sierra Club is settled, according to a webcast of the commission meeting. “I believe it to be prudent for this commission to deny any means of cost recovery from ratepayers until the Mississippi Supreme Court makes their ruling,” said Leonard Bentz, commission chairman, whose motion to deny the increase was supported by the PSC’s two other members. Under the state’s Base Load Act, Southern’s smallest utility, Mississippi Power Co, sought a 13-percent rate increase to begin recovering financing costs for the Kemper County IGCC plant, which is under construction and not expected to produce power until 2014. “We are extremely disappointed in the action taken today” by the commission, Mississippi Power said in a statement. “By enacting the provisions of the Base Load Act, customers would have saved several hundreds of millions in interest over the life of the plant.” Only two U.S. utilities, Southern and Duke Energy, are pursuing expensive IGCC plants. Dozens of other companies have scrapped similar projects after the technology was unable to gain traction due to high capital costs, carbon legislation delay and rising supplies of affordable natural gas. Earlier this month, Southern disclosed that the Kemper facility is running about $366 million, or 15 percent, above the company’s original $2.4 billion estimate. The commission imposed a “hard price cap” of $2.88 billion on the Kemper project when it voted, by a 2-1 vote, to approve a certificate in mid-2010. In Friday’s hearing commissioner Brandon Presley asked Mississippi Power vice president Tommy Anderson if he was still “confident” the utility could build Kemper for $2.44 billion as he testified before the commission in the earlier case. Anderson said the company now “expects” to build the plant for $2.76 billion and he is “confident” the plant can be built under the $2.88 billion cap. Under questioning from Presley, Anderson also said the utility could not guarantee that the IGCC technology developed by a Southern Co affiliate and KBR Inc, known as TRIG, would work at Kemper. He said he was “not in a position” to say whether Southern plans to share any potential future revenue from technology licenses with Mississippi rate payers. Southern licensed its gasification technology to a Chinese utility in 2009. The utility said construction would continue at the Kemper site while officials review the commission action. Bentz said he continues to believe the Kemper County plant is needed to diversify Mississippi Power’s fuel mix. “We don’t know what the cost of natural gas will be tomorrow, next year or in 40 years,” Bentz said in a release. “Likewise, we do not know what coal will cost in 40 years. The crucial thing is that we do know what Mississippi lignite will cost for the next 40 years.” A dozen citizens at the hearing criticized the project and the proposed rate increase while a number of representatives of business and economic development groups spoke in support of Kemper. “The commission finally acted in the best interests of Mississippi Power ratepayers,” said Louie Miller, director of the Mississippi Sierra Club in a release. The Sierra Club successfully challenged the commission’s 2010 approval of Kemper and has appealed the commission’s move to re-issue Kemper’s certificate in April. It opposes the Kemper plant because of its high cost and the rate impact on a small customer base.

60,SO,Southern Co appeals Mississippi's coal-plant rate hike denial,"July 9 (Reuters) - Southern Co’s Mississippi utility on Monday appealed last month’s denial of a rate increase linked to a $2.88 billion coal-gasification power plant under construction in Kemper County. Mississippi Power said it appealed to the state supreme court a Mississippi Public Service Commission decision to deny all rate increases related to the Kemper County plant, a 582-megawatt, integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) project, until a legal challenge from the environmental group the Sierra Club is settled. The appeal, which includes a motion for interim rate relief, is necessary to save customers millions of dollars in interest costs over the life of the plant, the company said in a release. The Kemper plant is already under construction and is expected to go online in May 2014. The three-member PSC denied the utility’s $55 million, six-month rate increase request in late June. Since then, Mississippi Power said its credit rating has been downgraded. Fitch Ratings said the commission’s denial “introduces significant uncertainty” for the utility, which is Southern’s smallest with just 185,000 customers. “Kemper IGCC is a relatively large and complex project for a utility of Mississippi Power’s size, and the delay in recovery of financing costs has already caused significant stress on Mississippi Power’s credit metrics,” Fitch said in its downgrade release in early July. Only two U.S. utilities, Southern and Duke Energy, are pursuing expensive IGCC plants. Many other utilities have scrapped more than three dozen such plants after they were delayed by rising capital costs, legislative red tape and increasing supplies of natural gas. Southern disclosed in June that the Kemper project is running about $366 million, or 15 percent, above the company’s original $2.4 billion estimate. Fitch said its negative outlook for Mississippi Power’s credit “reflects rising regulatory risks for the company in addition to the construction and operational risks associated with the IGCC project.” The Sierra Club, which opposes the Kemper plant due to its high cost and rate impact, successfully challenged the commission’s 2010 approval of Kemper and has appealed the commission’s move to re-issue Kemper’s certificate in April.",7092012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-southern-kemper/southern-co-appeals-mississippis-coal-plant-rate-hike-denial-idUSL2E8I9EOC20120709
61,SO,RPT-Southern Co CEO says US nuclear loan guarantee less enticing,"* Lower financing costs to benefit Southern nuclear, coal projects * Southern Power builds nation’s largest biomass plant in Texas By Eileen O’Grady NACOGDOCHES, TEXAS July 18 (Reuters) - Southern Co  said on Wednesday it was willing to complete the first new U.S. nuclear reactors being built in three decades without federal loan support, as talks on an $8.3 billion loan guarantee drag on. Southern Chief Executive Officer Tom Fanning said talks with the U.S. Energy Department were going slowly, and no resolution was in sight after new requirements were added to a conditional loan guarantee following the bankruptcy of solar panel maker Solyndra, which had received $500 million in loan guarantees. “I’ve got to be convinced that whatever terms and conditions we enter into ultimately work to the benefit of our customers,” Fanning told Reuters at the commissioning of a new biomass plant in East Texas. “If they don’t, we don’t need the loan guarantee.” Federal loan guarantees have been viewed as critical to encourage a revival of the U.S. nuclear industry as utilities seek to avoid a replay of ballooning costs that occurred when the last reactors were built in the 1980s. With only a few projects going forward, Southern’s two new $14 billion reactors at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia will test the industry’s ability to bring new units online and on budget. Fanning also said lower-than-expected financing costs would help offset any rise in construction costs at the power company’s two major construction projects — Plant Vogtle and a $2.8 billion advanced-coal plant in Mississippi. Southern has financed about $3 billion of its share of the new Vogtle units this year at costs well below the level anticipated when the project was certified by Georgia utility  regulators, he said. “We are way exceeding our ability to deliver the capital in a cost-efficient manner than anybody thought, and that’s for both Vogtle and Kemper,” Fanning said. “Therefore, the operating costs that customers will pay for,  I’m convinced, will be less than what they thought it would be when (regulators) approved it,” he said. Fanning also said he hoped the Mississippi Supreme Court would act quickly on an appeal by Southern’s Mississippi Power unit, which is seeking to charge its customers $55 million in early financing costs related to the Kemper County project, a 582-megawatt, integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) coal plant under construction. Late last month, the Mississippi Public Service Commission denied a rate increase linked to Kemper until a separate legal challenge to its certificate is settled. In its appeal, Mississippi Power cited a state law that would allow the utility to charge half its requested rate increase if the state supreme court fails to act in 30 days of the filing and the full amount of the increase if the court does not act in six months, Fanning said. “We are very hopeful that the Supreme Court will act and we won’t have to rely” on the state law, Fanning said. He said the dispute has had no impact on the pace of work at the Kemper project. “We are going full bore to finish this plant by the scheduled date,” Fanning said. “There is no slowdown.” He said Southern Power’s 100-MW biomass plant in Texas was completed on time and within its roughly $500 million budget. Electricity from the Nacogdoches facility is being sold to a municipal utility in Austin, Texas, under a 20-year contract at prices ranging from about 9 cents per kilowatt-hour rising to 13 cents. Fanning said the biomass plant, which will burn non-commercial wood products and wood waste from East Texas and nearby Louisiana, was an example of the direction U.S. energy policy needed to take to reduce dependence on foreign energy.

64,SO,Southern Co pares coal-plant compliance cost to $2.3 bln,"July 25 (Reuters) - Southern Co, one of the largest utility consumers of coal, cut the amount it plans to spend to keep its coal generating fleet in compliance with stricter federal environmental rules to about $2.3 billion, officials said Wednesday, down from estimates exceeding $4 billion. Last week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it would review its final rule on mercury emissions from power plants, known as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS, to add more flexibility. The changes will reduce the number of baghouses, or particle filtration units, that Southern’s utilities will need to install, said Art Beattie, Southern’s chief financial officer. That may pare the cost of MATS compliance to $1.8 billion, down $900 million from Southern’s previous estimate. Southern, which operates utilities in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida serving 4.4 million customers, has already shut 500 MW of coal-fired generation in Georgia and plans to shut another 600 MW next year. “Our strategy now calls for approximately 13,000 of coal-fired generation to be preserved for the long term,” said Beattie. Between 3,000 and 4,000 MW of Southern’s remaining 7,000 MW of coal generation may be retired and the rest will be repowered or replaced to burn other fuel, primarily natural gas, Beattie said. Southern also lowered its environmental compliance budget to reflect additional time allowed to deal with new coal waste and water regulation. Environmental spending over the next three years will account for 14 percent of Southern’s total capital spending of $16.3 billion over the 2012-2014 period, officials told analysts on a conference call. While the EPA changes “have resulted in a lower expected cost for MATS compliance, this is still a very expensive rule that will be difficult to comply with on a continuing basis,” Southern Chief Executive Tom Fanning told analysts. Fanning called the latest EPA regulations part of a set of “well-intentioned but overreaching rules ... that will eliminate a significant portion of America’s current coal generation fleet, and effectively prohibit new coal plants from being built.” Fanning said the EPA, an agency not accountable to voters, is now setting U.S. energy policy. Southern’s four utility units have reduced their reliance on coal so far this year to 38 percent of the generation mix, from 54 percent in the first half of 2011. Use of cheaper natural gas has risen to 45 percent, from 29 percent in the first half of last year. Southern’s unregulated generating unit, Southern Power, recently completed a 100-MW biomass plant in East Texas for about $500 million, but Fanning told Reuters that other EPA regulations have “chilled” development of biomass in the U.S. Southeast for now.",7252012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-southern-coal/southern-co-pares-coal-plant-compliance-cost-to-2-3-bln-idUSL2E8IPIFE20120725

68,SO,Mississippi court denies Southern Co interim coal-unit rate hike,"HOUSTON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Southern Co’s Mississippi utility was dealt another legal blow late Tuesday in its attempt to begin charging customers for costs tied to a $2.88 billion coal-gasification power plant under construction in Kemper County. The Mississippi Supreme Court, in an 8-0 vote, denied the utility’s motion to charge interim rates while the court hears its appeal of an unfavorable regulatory order denying all rate increases related to the Kemper County plant until an ongoing legal challenge from environmental group Sierra Club is resolved. Southern’s Mississippi Power unit is building a 582-megawatt, integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) plant scheduled to begin operating in May 2014. The three-member PSC denied the utility’s six-month, $55 million rate increase request in late June. However, Mississippi Power in August planned to begin charging about half the requested amount, subject to refund, to recover some Kemper financing costs while the plant is under construction as allowed under Mississippi statute. The utility said increasing rates now would save customers millions of dollars in interest costs over the life of the plant. “We view their decision on our motion to grant interim rates as a loss for our customers that will result in increased costs related to the Kemper plant,” Mississippi Power spokesman Jeff Shepard said in a statement. Lower-than-anticipated financing costs were a bright spot cited by Southern Co Chief Executive Tom Fanning on a call with analysts July 25. Fanning said lower financing costs will help offset rising construction costs, keeping Kemper’s final price tag below the amount approved by the state. “Our current analysis indicates that the overall cost to customers will be less than projected,” Fanning told analysts. Mississippi Power is Southern’s smallest utility with just 185,000 customers. Fanning said the PSC decision to deny recovery of financing costs during construction, called CWIP, was a “surprise” since two of three Mississippi commissioners consistently support the project to help diversify the utility’s generation mix. “We think CWIP is warranted for a project of this magnitude,” Fanning said. The Kemper plant is running nearly $485 million, or 20 percent, above the $2.4 billion cost approved by the PSC and is near the $2.88 billion “cap” set by the commission. Those costs do not include more than $240 million for a nearby mine to supply lignite to the plant and a $140 million pipeline to transport carbon dioxide emissions from the plant. Mississippi Power’s credit rating has been downgraded by one rating agency citing “rising regulatory risks for the company in addition to the construction and operational risks associated with the IGCC project.” The Sierra Club, which opposes the Kemper plant due to its high cost and rate impact, successfully challenged the commission’s 2010 approval of Kemper and has appealed the commission’s move to re-issue Kemper’s certificate in April. Louie Miller, state director of the Sierra Club in Mississippi, said the ruling was a “victory for ratepayers.” “It’s high time to pull the plug on Kemper,” Miller said in a release. Only two U.S. utilities, Southern and Duke Energy, are pursuing expensive IGCC plants. Many other utilities have scrapped more than three dozen such plants after they were delayed by rising capital costs, legislative red tape and increasing supplies of natural gas.

69,SO,Southern Co unit realigns Kemper plant contractors as costs rise,"HOUSTON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Southern Co’s Mississippi utility has consolidated contractors building a $2.88 billion coal-gasification power plant in Kemper County as it struggles to manage the project’s rising cost. The Kemper County plant, a 582-megawatt, integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) plant, has run into legal and regulatory difficulty, highlighting the industry’s difficulty in pursuing a long-term strategy to produce power from a variety of fuel sources in an era of low-cost natural gas. Only Southern and Duke Energy are building IGCC plants while more than three dozen other projects have been scrapped due to rising capital costs, carbon legislation delay and plentiful supplies of natural gas. The price tag to complete Kemper County has risen in recent months and is very close to a $2.88 billion cap set by state regulators as the maximum amount Mississippi Power will be allowed to recover from 188,000 customers. The plant is about one-third complete. Construction activity is nearing its peak and the project’s contingency fund has fallen to about $62 million. The plant is scheduled to begin operating in May 2014. Last week, Mississippi Power said it redefined the scope of work for Kemper’s three contractors: KBR Inc, Yates Construction and Performance Contractors Inc. “To make sure we bring in this project by May 2014 and to make sure that we bring it in at the lowest cost possible, we are looking at those contractors and how we are utilizing their  strengths,” said Mississippi spokeswoman Cindy Duvall. “For us, it is day-to-day management of a construction project,” Duvall said. Mississippi Power said the three companies will remain active at Kemper, but several hundred construction workers who had been working for a KBR construction joint venture were demobilized Aug. 9 and had to interview for jobs with the other companies. KBR, a co-owner with Southern Co of the gasification technology being used at Kemper, will continue its role in engineering and plant start-up, a spokeswoman said. “The only impact on KBR is the construction engagement piece,” said KBR’s Marianne Gooch. “We still have great relations with Southern.” The utility’s inability to begin charging customers for early plant costs while a legal challenge over its state certificate is resolved led Moody’s Investors Service to downgrade its senior unsecured debt last week. “Although the plant construction remains on schedule, IGCC technology is complex, specialized and not widely utilized,” Moody’s said. “The next 12 to 18 months will be critical in resolving these uncertainties and determining if the plant achieves commercial operation within its considerable time and budgetary constraints.” The Kemper plant has support of two of three state commissioners who want to diversify the utility’s generation mix, but the commission denied a $55 million rate increase request due to legal challenges from the Sierra Club. Earlier this month, the Mississippi Supreme Court also denied the utility’s motion to begin charging interim rates. The utility said increasing rates now would save customers millions of dollars in interest cost over the life of the plant. Southern Co Chief Executive Tom Fanning told Reuters last month that the Kemper plant technology - to burn coal while emitting fewer pollutants and greenhouse gas than existing coal plants - is “important to the United States.” “The U.S., through a variety of largely environmental regulations, has taken an energy-policy position ... that is really diminishing the ability of the U.S. to use one of its most valuable natural energy resources,” Fanning said. If not burned by U.S. utilities, coal will be burned in other countries, Fanning said, “to our disadvantage from a global, economic, competitiveness standpoint. This is poor policy.”",8132012,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-southern-kemper/southern-co-unit-realigns-kemper-plant-contractors-as-costs-rise-idUSL2E8JA69T20120813

71,SO,Court strikes down EPA rule on coal pollution,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday overturned a key Obama administration rule to reduce harmful emissions from coal-burning power plants, sparking a rally in coal company shares and relief among utility firms. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said in a 2-1 decision that the Environmental Protection Agency had exceeded its mandate with the rule, which was to limit sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants in 28 mostly Eastern states and Texas. In the latest setback for the EPA, the court sent the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule back for revision, telling the agency to administer its existing Clean Air Interstate Rule - the Bush-era regulation that it was updating - in the interim. The EPA said it was reviewing the ruling. The decision was cheered by some Republicans, who have made the EPA and President Barack Obama’s environmental policies a major campaign theme ahead of November elections. The agency is endangering a fragile economic recovery by saddling U.S. industries with costly new rules, Republicans say. “The Obama-EPA continues to demonstrate that it will stop at nothing in its determination to kill coal,” said Republican Senator James Inhofe, one of the Senate’s most vocal EPA opponents. “With so much economic pain in store, it is fortunate that EPA was sent back to the drawing board.” Power groups, which had argued that they could not meet the timeframe or bear the financial burden of installing costly new equipment, welcomed the court’s decision. The EPA had estimated it would cost $800 million annually from 2014. “The court was clear in finding that EPA had overstepped its legal authority in developing the rule,” said Scott Segal, director of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council. Coal company stocks, which have suffered this year as cheap natural gas undercut demand for coal from power companies, soared. Peabody Energy was 3.7 percent higher and Arch Coal rose 1.1 percent. U.S. natural gas futures briefly fell more than 3 percent after the ruling’s announcement as traders bet it would mean less demand for the cleaner fuel over the coming months. By midday, prices had recovered those losses. But some analysts saw little material impact from the ruling, with dozens of coal-fired plants already slated for closure due to other EPA regulations. “It gives the EPA a little bit more of a black eye,” said Andrew Weissman, senior energy adviser at law firm Haynes and Boone, which advises power and gas sector clients. “But in the bigger picture, it may not be important in terms of the practical consequences.” The EPA’s rule was designed to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 73 percent and nitrogen oxide by 54 percent at coal-fired power plants from 2005 levels, improving health for over 240 million people, according to the agency. The reasoning is that unhealthy emissions from those plants, pollutants that cause acid rain and smog, cross state lines. Two of the three judges ruling on the case said the EPA had exceeded its “jurisdictional limits” in interpreting the Clean Air Act and imposed “massive emission reduction requirements” on upwind states. “By doing so, EPA departed from its consistent prior approach to implementing the good neighbor provision and violated the (Clean Air Act),” Judge Brett Kavanaugh said in the court’s opinion. The rule, known as CSAPR, also established a cap-and-trade system that enabled power producers to comply with the emission limits by buying, trading and selling pollution permits. Environmental market traders said they were “surprised and disappointed” by the ruling. Power generators, such as Southern Co, had argued that the January 1 implementation date was too soon to design and install the needed pollution control equipment. Texas, along with the National Mining Association and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, also challenged the EPA, arguing the rule would cause undue financial burden on power producers and force companies to shut some older plants. “Vindicating the state’s objections to EPA’s aggressive and lawless approach, today’s decision is an important victory for federalism and a rebuke to a federal bureaucracy run amok,” said Greg Abbott, attorney general in Texas, where the power industry had warned that the rule could result in peak-season blackouts. Democratic Senator Tom Carper, who authored bills to curb mercury, SOX and NOx emissions in previous years, said he would try to push for new legislation if an appeal failed. Segal of the Electric Reliability Coordinating Council said the CSAPR, along with other EPA rules, did not show sufficient respect or deference to state programs. “Today’s decision is a stern warning against EPA’s recent views,” he said. Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, hailed the ruling. “This was not entirely surprising because it’s the third or fourth ruling by a federal court that shows the EPA to be overriding the authority that the states have and conducting an unlawful regulatory program against coal,” he said. Environmental groups warned that the decision would put lives at risk and urged the EPA to appeal the decision. “The court’s decision significantly imperils long overdue clean air safeguards for millions of Americans,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund. Patton said the EPA should move in parallel to “swiftly put in place replacement protections” and to ask the three-judge panel and the full court to rehear the case. John Walke, clean air director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the dissenting opinion of Judge Judith Rogers more accurately reflected the opinion of the court. “The EPA can - and should - immediately appeal this decision. The dissenting judge correctly follows the Clean Air Act and prior rulings by this court. The majority opinion is an outlier at odds with the court’s own rulings as well as the Clean Air Act,” Walke said. Judge Rogers said the other two judges were “trampling on this court’s precedent on which the Environmental Protection Agency was entitled to rely in developing the Transport Rule rather than be blindsided by arguments raised for the first time in this court”. The appeals court had in June ruled 2-1 in favor of the EPA in a challenge to the agency’s greenhouse gas regulations.

73,SO,"Southern, KBR form alliance to advance coal-plant technology","HOUSTON (Reuters) - A partnership between a subsidiary of Southern Co (SO.N) and KBR Inc (KBR.N) will market a coal-gasification technology to power companies worldwide, the companies said in a release on Monday. An alliance between Southern Generation Technologies LLC and KBR LLC will work to sell utilities a technology known as Transport Integrated Gasification, or TRIG, which can be used to gasify low-quality coal to generate electricity while reducing carbon emissions to a level more like a typical natural gas-fired power plant. Southern Co and KBR developed TRIG technology under a U.S. Department of Energy program. “Through the development of TRIG technology, we’ve found a way to preserve coal as an important, low-carbon energy resource for America,” said Southern Co Chief Executive Thomas Fanning, in a statement. Southern’s Mississippi Power utility is building an integrated-gasification-combined-cycle (IGCC) plant utilizing TRIG technology and an adjacent lignite mine in Kemper County, Mississippi, at a cost of $3 billion. Since emission controls are built into the coal-gasification process, the project is expected to have fewer sulfur dioxide, particulate and mercury emissions than traditional pulverized coal technology while capturing at least 65 percent of the carbon dioxide produced, Southern said. The agreement gives KBR exclusive global licensing rights for power generation in addition to its existing rights in industrial applications of TRIG, said Southern, which will provide engineering and technology expertise. The partnership hopes that as electric demand grows around the world, the TRIG technology will be attractive to countries seeking to use low-cost, abundant coal resources, like China, India and Asia. More than half the world’s coal reserves consist of lower quality lignite and sub-bituminous coal, Southern said, the type of coal TRIG was developed to use. China is expected to add more than 300,000 megawatts of new coal-based generating capacity by 2035 while India and other parts of Asia are projected to add more than 100,000 MW, Southern said. The alliance will “accelerate the adoption of TRIG in the marketplace,” said Bill Utt, KBR’s chief executive officer.

78,SO,American chef's independent spirit fires Southern cuisine,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - “Fire in my Belly” is an apt title for the debut cookbook of U.S. chef and restaurateur Kevin Gillespie, who turned down a scholarship to the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology because a career in science just didn’t feel right. “I’ve always been incapable of pursuing something that I didn’t have a connection with, not so much cerebral as emotional,” explained Gillespie, whose passions led instead to culinary school and an apprenticeship at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Atlanta. Under chapters such as “Foods You Thought You Hated” and “Junk Food,” the 120 recipes in Gillespie’s book reflect his independent spirit as much as his former restaurant, the Woodfire Grill, and his Southern roots. Gillespie, who is from Atlanta and was recognized in 2010 by the Gayot guide as one of the top five rising U.S. chefs, spoke to Reuters about “progressive Southern cuisine,” non-elitist fine dining, and why a well-executed deep-fried candy bar can be really delicious. Q: How did you learn to cook? A: “Everyone learns from their family. I grew up in a traditional Southern family cooking traditional Southern cuisine. Simultaneously my maternal grandmother was well traveled and intrigued by food, so she would experiment with different types of cuisine ... Professionally, I worked almost exclusively under Europeans. Today, my food is a perfect blending of all these things.” Q: You sold your Woodfire Grill restaurant in Atlanta to open a new one, Gun Show, in February in the same city. Why? A: “I had an elitist restaurant. The Woodfire Grill restaurant, which I had for five years, was very formal fine dining. As I grew as a chef I became more interested in having a restaurant that people in all walks of life can be comfortable in. That’s not to say that we’ll abandon fine dining, but I wanted a more welcoming space. I think cooking has always attempted to bring people together, not separate them.” Q: How would you describe your cuisine? A: “My cuisine is reflective of the South, rooted in the South. I tend to prefer the term ‘progressive Southern’ to ‘modern Southern,’ which I think is oxymoronic. I’m not attempting to modernize anything. I’m attempting to move our history forward.” Q: Why does your book include a chapter called Junk Food? A: “There is a place in this world for all types of food. I don’t believe that by design one type of cooking is better. I think that by execution one tends to be better. I think that well-conceived and well-executed quote-unquote junk food can be really delicious. But it requires the same thought and passion as your five-star fine dining cuisine.” Q: Is that what led to re-engineer the deep-fried candy bar? A: “The deep-fried candy bar is rooted in Scottish tradition. The idea is cool but it’s poorly executed. No one really tried to make it great. They just made it ... Most people outside of chefs wouldn’t spend five minutes trying to make a fried candy bar perfect. It’s just junk food, so who cares? I care.” Q: What staples do you recommend to the home chef? A: “People leave salt out of their food all the time, maybe because processed food has salt embedded in it. When you deal with fresh food you have to come back to seasoning, to salt. Also neutral cooking oil, such as canola or grape seed, (but) not as a substitute for extra virgin olive oil. They have different uses. And good quality apple cider vinegar. For American cooking it’s indispensable.” Q: Do you have any advice for the home cook? A: “The only real time in the kitchen is how long things take to cook. It’s not when you’re ready to eat or when your (TV) show is coming on. If you try to find faster ways to do something you will end up with a lesser quality result.” My Granny’s Pole Beans (serves six) Pole beans 1 pound, strings and tips removed Onion 1 baseball-size, quartered Garlic 1 clove, mashed Smoked fatback 2 ounces, cut into 1-inch cubes Salt 1 teaspoon Dried red pepper flakes ½ teaspoon Bay leaf 1 Chicken stock about 4 cups Apple cider vinegar 2 teaspoons Cut the pole beans into 1-inch pieces and put them in a Dutch oven.

80,SO,UPDATE 2-Mississippi reconsiders Southern Co utility rate hike denial,"* Utility to refile request for higher rates tied to Kemper * Settlement calls for future royalty payments to customers By Eileen O’Grady Jan 24 (Reuters) - The Mississippi Public Service Commission on Thursday approved a settlement with Southern Co’s  Mississippi utility that will allow the company to seek higher rates for costs tied to a $3 billion coal-gasification power plant under construction in Kemper County. Mississippi Power Co is building a 582-megawatt, integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) plant scheduled to begin operating in May 2014. Thursday’s settlement gives Mississippi Power Co another chance to request a rate hike of as much as $172 million this year and calls for the commission to act on the request within 50 days of the utility’s request. Last June, the commission denied the utility’s request for $55 million over six months, saying customer rates should not be raised until a legal challenge from an environmental group, the  Sierra Club, was resolved. The Mississippi Supreme Court also denied the utility’s motion to charge interim rates while the Kemper certificate was under appeal. Louie Miller, the Sierra Club’s state director, said the settlement offers no benefits to Mississippi Power customers and was approved only to help the utility which he said is struggling financially. “They (Mississippi Power) bit off way more than they can chew” with the costly Kemper project, said Miller. “Today’s reckless actions by the commission have opened the door for Mississippi Power to charge their customer base for the boondoggle Kemper County Coal Plant while it’s under construction, with no guarantee that the plant will ever produce a single megawatt of electricity,” Miller said. In the settlement, the commission acknowledged that uncertainty over the rate issue has hurt Mississippi Power’s credit rating. It also cited “a high likelihood” that the Kemper County certificate will withstand the ongoing court appeal. The commission voted 2-to-1 to approve the settlement at a special meeting called a day earlier. No details of the proposed settlement were discussed before the commission held an executive session which was closed to the public. The pact also sets up a framework to establish cost-recovery for the Kemper plant over the first seven years of its operation, if allowed by the state legislature. In return, Mississippi Power customers will receive a credit for 10 percent of any royalties Southern derives from future sale to other utilities of the gasification technology being used at Kemper. “The settlement today further puts into place the protections of the ratepayers by affirming the cost cap for the Kemper Project at $2.4 billion,” said PSC Chairman Leonard Bentz in a statement. Mississippi Power officials did not return calls for comment. The utility is Southern Co’s smallest with just 185,000 customers, so the rate impact of the costly Kemper facility is of concern to regulators and consumer groups in the state. Under the Mississippi Baseload Act, the utility planned to begin charging customers for certain costs related to Kemper while the plant was under construction, but its efforts were blocked by the state’s highest court. Thursday’s special meeting precedes scheduled oral arguments on Monday at the state supreme court related not only to Mississippi Power’s appeal of the rate denial but to the larger question of whether the state law under which Mississippi Power would raise customer rates during construction is constitutional. Michael Adelman, an attorney representing some of the utility’s customers in the appeal, said the oral arguments should go forward. “I’m going to be at the court at 1:30 Monday, unless told otherwise,” he said. “We believe there are serious constitutional problems with that statute.” Adelman said the settlement “kicks the can down the road in an attempt to create some aura that they have reached an agreement, but they have not reached any more of an agreement than in all the months we spent before the hearing last June when they denied any increase.” The settlement keeps intact the commission’s $2.4 billion approved cost for the plant plus contingency costs. Additional costs, including $240 million for a nearby mine to supply lignite to the plant and a $140 million pipeline to transport carbon dioxide emissions from the plant, will push the total Kemper price tag above $3 billion.

82,SO,Southern Co unit requests higher rates for Kemper coal plant,"* Settlement opens door for recovery above earlier cost cap * Rate request puts focus on Supreme Court hearing Jan 25 (Reuters) - Southern Co’s Mississippi Power unit filed a request late Friday to increase its rates by $172 million to begin collecting costs related to a $3 billion coal-gasification power plant under construction in Kemper County, Southern officials said. The rate filing with state regulators comes one day after the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved a settlement that opens the door for the utility to recover all rising costs associated with the advanced coal plant, including costs above a $2.4 billion price cap previously set by the commission. The 582-megawatt Kemper County plant is one of only two integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) plants being built in the country. It is designed to burn lignite from a nearby mine using a technology developed by another unit of Southern Co over the past decade. The Kemper plant, which will capture a portion of its carbon dioxide emissions for use in enhanced oil and gas operations, is scheduled to begin operation in May 2014. If approved by regulators, a rate request would represent a 21 percent rate increase that could show up on customer bills as early as April, Southern Co Chief Executive Officer Art Beattie told analysts on a call Friday. Mississippi Power is the smallest unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co, with just 185,000 customers, so the rate impact of the costly Kemper facility is of concern to regulators and consumer groups in the state. Opponents argue the plant is no longer economical with natural gas prices falling. Thursday’s settlement agreement overturned the commission’s previous order to deny any rate increase related to Kemper until a legal challenge from an environmental group, the Sierra Club, was resolved. Now the commission will allow Mississippi Power to seek recovery of early Kemper financing costs with the understanding that the “construction work in progress,” or CWIP, funds will help reduce the overall interest that customers pay for the plant over time. The settlement also gives the utility a new way to recover escalating construction costs through securitization. The commission had previously “capped” the amount that Mississippi Power could recover from its customers through base rates at $2.4 billion, plus some contingency funds, for a total of $2.88 billion. Customers would also pay for the adjacent lignite mine and a CO2 pipeline, now pegged at $377 million. Cost overruns have already pushed Kemper’s price tag to the $2.8 billion level, according to PSC reports. Under the settlement, Mississippi Power is now seeking a new state law that will mandate the use of securitized bonds to cover any additional costs of the plant “not addressed in base rates,”  officials told analysts. “While there is much work to be done, this agreement defines a much-needed process for rate recovery to be considered,” said Southern Chief Executive Officer Tom Fanning. With securitization, a utility sells bonds which are repaid over a long period of time through a charge on customers’ bills. The process benefits the utility because it recovers its money quickly. Customers benefit because current interest rates are generally much lower than the interest earned by the utility. “Securitization looks like a creative way of dealing with the potential rate impact of the cost of the plant,” said Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with Glenrock Associates. Commissioner Brandon Presley, who has consistently opposed the Kemper project for its high price tag and untried technology, voted against Thursday’s settlement. “I have consistently said that I oppose the general concept of customers paying for a project before they get any benefit from it,” Presley said. “Nothing in the settlement changes that scenario.” Friday’s CWIP rate request will likely increase interest in a Mississippi Supreme Court hearing set for Monday on a constitutional challenge to the Baseload Act, a 2008 law which first allowed utilities the option to seek higher rates during power-plant construction. “With this new development, I’m optimistic that the court will render a decision that will clarify these issues within a reasonable period of time,” said Michael Adelman, an attorney representing a utility customer in the cross appeal.

84,SO,Southern Co's coal-gasification plant cost may reach $3.8 billion,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Southern Co’s Mississippi utility is supporting legislation that would allow it to recover another $1 billion from ratepayers for the Kemper County coal-gasification power plant, pushing the potential price tag for the controversial project to $3.8 billion. A bill, written specifically for the Kemper project, would allow Mississippi Power to sell up to $1 billion of “securitized” bonds to cover costs of the plant - over and above the $2.8 billion the utility can recover through base rates. The bill would also allow Mississippi Power to create a “special purpose entity” to issue the bonds which will not be considered utility debt, according to the legislation, sponsored by Mississippi Sen. Terry Burton. Southern Co Chief Executive Officer Tom Fanning said that two Kemper-related bills have passed out of committees at the Mississippi Legislature, in a call with analysts on Wednesday. “We look forward to monitoring their progress over the next few weeks,” Fanning told investors. The Mississippi utility is Southern Co’s smallest with just 185,000 customers, so the rate impact of the costly Kemper facility is of concern to regulators and consumer groups. Fanning said the 582-megawatt facility is 75 percent complete and will be operational in May 2014. Kemper’s gas turbines will begin testing in June, Fanning said. Equipment to convert lignite from an adjacent mine into synthesis gas will begin testing in December. “Reliable syn gas is expected to begin flowing to the (turbines) in February 2014,” Fanning said. However, an independent monitor’s report said Kemper won’t likely be operational until November or December 2014. The monitor’s report, filed in November of last year, said construction was only 30 percent complete and that the plant’s price tag may exceed $3.16 billion, excluding the nearly $400 million cost of the mine and a carbon dioxide pipeline. The Kemper legislation follows a surprise agreement announced last week between Mississippi Power and the Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC) to settle a legal dispute over the commission’s refusal to grant a Kemper-related rate increase while a legal challenge from the Sierra Club continues over the plant’s certificate. With securitization, a utility sells bonds which are repaid over a long period of time through a non-bypassable charge on all customers’ bills. The process benefits the utility because it recovers its money as soon as the bond are sold. Customers benefit because current interest rates are generally much lower than the interest rate the utility is allowed to charge customers. If passed, however, the bill eliminates a $2.8 billion “hard cap,” or limit on the amount of money the Mississippi PSC said the utility could charge for the plant when it approved Kemper’s certificate last April. While the settlement wording is not clear, it appears to “eviscerate” the rate cap, giving Mississippi Power “a blank check for the Kemper project,” said David Cruthirds, a Houston regulatory attorney in a report to clients. “The securitization is tantamount to guaranteed recovery,” Cruthirds said. “That means the cost cap was removed without notice, without the opportunity for interested parties to be heard and without a public hearing,” Cruthirds wrote. Mississippi Power also filed last week for a $172 million rate hike to cover certain financing costs related to Kemper. Fanning said the proposed 21-percent increase could go on customer bills as soon as April. Kemper is designed to showcase a gasification technology developed over the past decade by another unit of Southern and KBR Inc. The companies are working to sell the technology around the world. While commending Southern for developing new technology, Cruthirds said “there seems to be no question that (Mississippi Power’s) customers are subsidizing commercialization of Southern Co’s technology development efforts” which is “a huge benefit for Southern’s shareholders.” The Kemper plant is one of only two integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) plants under construction in the country following cancellation of dozens of such projects due to rising costs, lack of carbon legislation and competition from cheaper natural gas-fired generation. Indiana regulators limited the amount Duke Energy can recover from customers for the Edwardsport IGCC plant, forcing the utility to absorb nearly $900 million in cost overruns. The $3.5 billion plant may begin producing power later this year after numerous delays.

86,SO,"Southern Co's new Georgia Vogtle reactors to cost more, take longer","March 4 (Reuters) - U.S. power company Southern Co  said the two new power reactors under construction at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia will cost more because the units will enter service later than expected. In a report to Georgia utility regulators last week, Southern’s Georgia Power unit asked the utility regulators to approve $737 million of additional costs for its share of the new reactors, bringing the company’s total to $6.85 billion. Based on Southern’s 47.5 percent share of the two 1,100-megawatt (MW) Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, the total cost of the project could exceed $14 billion. In its eighth semi-annual construction monitoring report, Georgia Power said the units are now expected to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2018. Earlier, the company had projected the reactors would enter service in 2016 and 2017. The company said the delays were due in part to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulatory changes, increased taxes, costs necessary for operational readiness, quality and compliance during construction, transmission costs, and legal and environmental permitting costs. Separately, Westinghouse and Shaw, the contractors building the new units at Vogtle, filed a lawsuit in November in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Georgia Power and the other Vogtle owners, seeking about $900 million. The contractors’ lawsuit was over disputed costs resulting from design changes to certain equipment and components of the plant, as well as costs associated with delays related to the timing of approval of the design control document and issuance of the construction and operating licenses. Georgia Power and the other Vogtle owners have filed a complaint against Westinghouse and Shaw on the same issues in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia in Augusta. The litigation is pending. Westinghouse is majority owned by Japanese multinational Toshiba Corp. Shaw is now part of engineering and construction company Chicago Bridge & Iron Co NV (CB&I;). Vogtle is jointly owned by Georgia Power (45.7 percent), Oglethorpe Power Corp (30 percent), Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (22.7 percent) and Dalton Utilities (1.6 percent).",3042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-southern-vogtle/southern-cos-new-georgia-vogtle-reactors-to-cost-more-take-longer-idUSL1N0BWHQF20130304
87,SO,Southern Co utility to raise rates for Mississippi coal plant,"HOUSTON, March 5 (Reuters) - State regulators approved a 15 percent rate increase for customers of Southern Co’s  Mississippi Power unit on Tuesday to allow the utility to begin recovering costs for a controversial coal-gasification power plant under construction in Kemper County. The 582-megawatt Kemper County plant is one of only two integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) plants being built in the country. The project was initially expected to cost about $2 billion, but the price tag now is expected to reach $3.5 billion. Other rate action taken on Tuesday by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC) will temper the jump to about 12 percent to 13 percent, or roughly $16 per month for a customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours of power, beginning with April bills. Monthly bills will rise another 3 percent next year. Mississippi Power sought an annual increase of $172 million, or a 21 percent rate increase, but the commission trimmed that amount to $125 million this year. The vote was 2-1 with Commissioner Brandon Presley voting against the rate increase. Presley has consistently opposed the Kemper project for its high price tag and unproven technology. The Mississippi utility is Southern Co’s smallest with just 186,000 customers, so the rate impact of the costly Kemper facility is of concern to regulators and consumer groups. PSC Chairman Leonard Bentz chided both Mississippi Power and critics of the plant for the amount of “misinformation” about the rate impact from Kemper. “It’s a shame both sides have not educated people on this,” Bentz said. The exact amount of the rate increase was not available late on Tuesday, a utility spokeswoman said. After the increase in 2014, Mississippi Power rates will remain stable until 2020, with the exception of fuel-cost adjustments and the cost of Kemper-related bonds to be sold late next year. A certificate issued by the Mississippi commission to allow the plant’s construction remains the subject of a legal appeal as does the state law that commissioners used on Tuesday to allow Mississippi Power to collect $125 million from customers before the plant is completed and operational, which is expected in May 2014. Last month, the Mississippi Legislature approved a bill to allow the utility to sell up to $1 billion of “securitized” bonds to cover Kemper costs over and above the $2.8 billion the utility can recover through base rates. The cost of the bonds will add another 3 percent to 5 percent to monthly bills depending on the interest rate at which they are sold, Moses Feagan, Mississippi Power’s chief financial officer told the commission. The utility expects to issue $700 million to $800 million in bonds in the fourth quarter of 2014, Feagan said. In January, Mississippi Power and the commission announced a settlement overturning the PSC’s previous order denying any rate increase related to Kemper until a legal challenge from an environmental group, the Sierra Club, was resolved. Kemper is designed to showcase gasification technology using low quality lignite coal developed by another unit of Southern Co and KBR Inc. The companies are working to sell the technology around the world.",3052013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-southern-kemper/southern-co-utility-to-raise-rates-for-mississippi-coal-plant-idUSL1N0BXKQB20130305

89,SO,"Southern Co drops one federal loan request, pursues larger one","* Mississippi utility says it can finance coal plant for less * Georgia unit still wants to finalize DOE nuclear loan terms By Eileen O’Grady HOUSTON, April 1 (Reuters) - Mississippi Power Co, the smallest utility of giant Southern Co, withdrew its request for a $1.5 federal billion loan guarantee for a controversial clean-coal project just days after state regulators approved an agreement giving the utility a new avenue to cover rising costs for the project. A Southern Co spokesman said Mississippi Power dropped a plan to seek a loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy for its Kemper County coal project in late January after determining it could find lower-cost financing than what it expected the government program to offer. The withdrawal was prompted by a settlement approved by the Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC) that allowed the company to pursue legislation to issue up to $1 billion in securitized bonds to recover Kemper costs over and above a $2.8 billion limit set by the state. Mississippi Power is Southern Co’s smallest utility with just 185,000 customers, so the rate impact of the costly Kemper facility is of concern to regulators and consumer groups. Meanwhile, Southern Co remains “cautiously optimistic” it can negotiate favorable terms to obtain its share of an $8.3 billion DOE loan guarantee for the $15 billion two-reactor expansion at the Vogtle nuclear station in Georgia. “We are committed to financing options that will serve the best interests of our customers, and we have been pursuing loan guarantees as long as the terms and conditions continue to serve those interests,” said Southern Co spokesman Tim Leljedal in an email. The price tag for the 582-megawatt Kemper County integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) plant, along with the lignite mine and carbon dioxide pipeline has risen from about $2.4 billion when proposed to more than $3.2 billion, according to recent utility filings. “Since 2010, Mississippi Power has issued $1.1 billion of additional debt - during a time of very low interest rates - and the majority of these funds were used for Kemper construction,”  Leljedal said. “Along with potential proceeds from securitization debt, the project will be fully financed at debt costs well below what was originally contemplated for the project,” he said. Mississippi Power began building the Kemper plant in 2010 despite an ongoing legal challenge to the plant’s need certificate issued by the PSC. It faces a May 2014 deadline to begin service to keep certain tax incentives, according to company filings. The recent regulatory settlement also allowed the Mississippi utility to seek a rate increase previously rejected by the commission. Mississippi Power said the PSC’s denial of recovery of early Kemper costs hurt its credit rating. Mississippi Power said it has so far spent more than $2.6 billion on the Kemper project, one of only two IGCC projects being built in the United States after rising costs, lack of carbon legislation and competition from cheaper gas-fired generation led to cancellation of dozens of clean-coal projects. “Reducing financing cost is one way to save the customers money on their bill, while being provided reliable energy for the future,” said Mississippi PSC Chairman Leonard Bentz. Southern spokesman Leljedal said the company continues to work to finalize terms of the $8.3 billion “conditional” loan guarantee granted in 2010 to a Southern Co-led consortium building two 1,100-megawatt nuclear units at Vogtle, one of the few new U.S. nuclear projects to move forward in three decades. Last month, Georgia Power reached a significant milestone, the pouring of 7,000 cubic yards of concrete that will serve as the nuclear units’ foundation. “There continues to be constructive dialogue in the Vogtle 3 and 4 loan guarantee negotiations between the company and the DOE, and we are cautiously optimistic as we work toward the DOE’s June deadline,” Leljedal said. The Vogtle loan guarantee was expected to be finalized last year but the process bogged down over terms and costs. Southern said talks were further complicated by DOE requirements added after the much-publicized bankruptcy of solar panel maker Solyndra which had received loan guarantees. Southern’s Chief Executive Tom Fanning has said the company is willing to complete the reactors without federal loan support if necessary. “I’ve got to be convinced that whatever terms and conditions we enter into ultimately work to the benefit of our customers,” Fanning told Reuters last year. “If they don’t, we don’t need the loan guarantee.” DOE loans were viewed as critical to revive U.S. nuclear development by helping companies avoid the risk of ballooning costs that accompanied the last round of nuclear construction in the 1980s. However, analysts said the dramatic fall in interest rates since the Vogtle project was announced has lessened the need for government support. Fanning has highlighted the fact that lower-than-expected financing costs will help offset rising construction on calls with investors. Last month, Georgia Power told regulators that its 45.7-percent stake in the Vogtle reactors will cost $6.85 billion, up from estimates of $6.4 billion because completion will be delayed by at least one year.",4012013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-southern-doe/southern-co-drops-one-federal-loan-request-pursues-larger-one-idUSL2N0CI1UP20130401

93,SO,"More workers, pipe needed to finish Southern Co coal project","HOUSTON, April 24 (Reuters) - More high-quality pipe and more workers are needed to complete Southern Co’s  coal-gasification plant in Kemper County, Mississippi, by a 2014 deadline, company executives said on Wednesday. Atlanta-based Southern Co said a $333 million charge to cover cost overruns at the Kemper plant reduced first-quarter earnings to $81 million, or 9 cents per share, from $368 million, or 42 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2012. In a filing late Tuesday, Southern’s Mississippi Power unit said the cost to build Kemper, a 582-megawatt, integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) plant, had risen by $540 million to more than $4.2 billion, about double early estimates. The parent company will absorb the cost overrun to maintain commitments made by Mississippi Power to state regulators,     Southern Co Chief Executive Tom Fanning told investors. Fanning said the company inaccurately estimated how much critical piping would be needed to marry the coal gasifier, carbon capture and turbine systems that will produce electricity. “We made the decision to essentially improve the quality of (the piping), improve the thickness, improve the metallurgy,” Fanning told investors on a call. Another shift of workers has been added to get the plant into operation by a May 2014 deadline to take advantage of $133 million or more in investment tax credits and to be able to continue to accrue financing-related costs above a $2.88 billion limit set by state regulators. “This Kemper situation is something that we’re disappointed in,” said Fanning. “We’ve got our heads down,” Fanning said. “We’re focused on this. And we’re going to do everything we can to improve performance going forward.” Environmental group Sierra Club, which is challenging Kemper’s construction, called on the Mississippi Public Service Commission to immediately review the prudency of the utility’s investment in the costly project. “The Sierra Club and our experts have been warning of this for years,” said Louie Miller, state director of the group. “It’s time to pull the plug on this dirty, expensive, and unnecessary boondoggle.” Fanning said the biggest challenge in getting Kemper operational on time is the instrumentation needed to “harmonize” the operation from coal intake to the gasifier, capture of carbon dioxide from the synthesis gas and transfer of the gas to turbines to generate electricity. As Mississippi Power spends money at Kemper, Fanning said Southern Co will make a capital contribution to the utility, Southern’s smallest with just 185,000 customers, to bolster its financial structure. With the addition of new generation at Kemper, Southern’s share of the output from two new Vogtle nuclear reactors which are under construction in Georgia and other long-term power contracts, Southern is unlikely to need additional power plants before 2023, Fanning said. Southern’s utilities burned more Powder River Basin coal in the first quarter than other types of eastern U.S. coal which are more expensive, but overall reliance on coal was steady at 32 percent of the generation mix, flat from the 2012 first quarter. Despite rising prices for natural gas since 2012, Southern’s use of gas increased to 47 percent of the generation mix in the quarter, from 45 percent a year ago. First-quarter nuclear output fell to 16 percent from 19 percent a year earlier, with hydro output about steady. Officials said they continue to investigate the cause of an April 4 explosion at Georgia Power’s 3,166-megawatt, coal-fired Plant Bowen in Bartow County. Fanning could not say when the units there might return to service or whether the damaged unit will be repaired.",4242013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-southern-kemper/more-workers-pipe-needed-to-finish-southern-co-coal-project-idUSL2N0DB2LR20130424
94,SO,Costs rise for Southern Co's coal gasification plant,"HOUSTON, July 1 (Reuters) - The cost to finish building Southern Co’s controversial coal-gasification power plant in Kemper County, Mississippi, may increase by at least $160 million to $4.5 billion or more, or  more than double initial cost estimates, the company said in a filing with regulators. Separately, the utility last week filed a petition asking state regulators to hold a “prudency review” to approve all money spent on the Kemper project through the end of March. In April, Southern Co said it needed to spend an additional $540 million for higher quality pipe and more workers to complete the 582-megawatt, integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) plant by May 2014, and recorded a $333 million charge to first-quarter earnings. The utility sees additional cost pressure from ongoing construction activity, inventory and start-up energy costs.     The company is reviewing the potential cost increases, a spokeswoman said. Two top executives at Southern’s Mississippi Power unit were replaced after questions were raised about whether Mississippi Power withheld information about Kemper’s rising costs from members of the Mississippi Public Service Commission (PSC). In a monthly report to the PSC, Mississippi Power, Southern’s smallest unit, said it has spent $3.14 billion so far on the Kemper project, one of only two recent IGCC projects in the country. IGCC technology was touted as a way for utilities to continue to take advantage of the nation’s abundant coal supplies despite rising concerns about carbon pollution and global warming, but dozens of projects were scrapped due to high costs and other factors. The Kemper report estimated the total cost will exceed $4.5 billion, including a $250 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy. The PSC put a cap on the Kemper project, saying the utility can recover no more than $2.88 billion from customers for the IGCC plant. The company can also recover costs for the lignite mine and a pipeline to move captured carbon dioxide emissions. Under a state law, the utility can recover up to $1 billion in costs that exceed the PSC cap by selling securitized bonds. Customer rates went up 12 percent in April to help cover certain Kemper-related costs. In May, Moody’s Investor Service put Mississippi Power’s ratings on review for possible downgrade, calling the Kemper project “one of the most expensive generating plants being built in the country today.” Kemper is designed to showcase gasification technology using low quality lignite coal developed by another unit of Southern Co and KBR Inc. The companies are working to sell the technology around the world. Duke Energy completed another IGCC plant last month in Indiana, about one year late. The 618-MW Edwardsport plant, which was not built to capture carbon emissions, cost $3.5 billion, up 75 percent from early estimates.

96,SO,Fitch Rates Southern Company's Senior Notes 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, August 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned its 'A' rating to the  Southern Company's issuance of $500 million series 2013A 2.45% senior notes due  Sept. 1, 2018.  These notes are senior, unsecured obligations of Southern  Company. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The net proceeds from the offering will be used to repay a portion of Southern  Company's outstanding short-term indebtedness, which totaled approximately $739  million as of Aug. 20, 2013, and for other general corporate purposes. KEY RATING DRIVERS: Southern Company's ratings recognize the relatively stable and predictable cash  generation of its operating subsidiaries and the financial support it gets from  them in the form of dividends for the payment of corporate expenses, debt  service, dividends to common stockholders, and for other business matters.  Southern Company's regulated utility subsidiaries enjoy a relatively favorable  regulatory framework in their service territories and exhibit limited commodity  price risks due to the ability to recover fuel and purchased power through  separate cost trackers.  Its non-regulated generation subsidiary, Southern Power Company, follows a  conservative business model by signing long-term sale contracts with  creditworthy counterparties and has minimal commodity exposure via recovery of  fuel costs through its power supply contracts. Southern Company provides equity  funding to its subsidiaries for their long-term growth and to optimize their  capital mix within a target range. The Stable Outlook for Southern Company  reflects adequate liquidity, financial flexibility, and easy access to capital  markets during a period of high capital investment.  Regulatory risk has increased for Southern Company's utility subsidiaries given  the ongoing rate proceedings at Georgia Power Company (Georgia Power) and Gulf  Power Company (Gulf Power), and higher regulatory scrutiny of Mississippi Power  Company's (Mississippi Power) cost overruns associated with the 580 MW  Integrated Gasification and Combined Cycle (IGCC) plant at Kemper. Favorable  outcome for Georgia Power's regulatory proceedings will be key to sustaining  Southern Company's current ratings given that it accounts for approximately 50%  of consolidated operating income.  Fitch acknowledges that the downside risk to return on equity (ROE) is high for  Georgia Power given the national trend of declining ROEs. At the same time,  Fitch recognizes the constructive regulatory regime in Georgia and low commodity  prices that provide a favorable backdrop for rate negotiation. The last rate  case outcome for Georgia Power in 2010 was quite constructive, which enabled the  utility to embark on a heavy capex spend with strong credit metrics. Fitch  believes Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) will continue to be supportive  of the financial health of the utility. Furthermore, the expected increase under  the Nuclear Construction Cost Recovery (NCCR) tariff of approximately 1% per  year through 2017 lowers the overall rate pressure on Georgia Power's customers.  Southern Company's second largest subsidiary, Alabama Power Company (Alabama  Power), recently received a vote from the Alabama PSC regarding review of its  rate stabilization and equalization (RSE) mechanism. The PSC voted to replace  the current ROE range of 13.0%-14.5% and allowed equity ratio of 45% with a  weighted cost of equity (WCE) provision. The WCE range was established by the  PSC at 5.75%-6.21% with an adjusting point of 5.98%, which is modestly lower  than the implied WCE range under current rates of 5.85%-6.53% with an adjusting  point of 6.19%. In addition, Alabama Power will be eligible for a  performance-based adder of 0.07% if it is rated 'A' by at least one of the major  credit rating agencies or is in the top one-third in customer satisfaction  survey. The resolution of the RSE review is in line with Fitch's expectation and  removes a key source of regulatory uncertainty for Alabama Power. Fitch's rating concerns for Southern Company include significant construction  and regulatory risks associated with the two large baseload projects under  construction, namely the 2,200 MW Plant Vogtle nuclear units 3 and 4 being built  by Georgia Power and the 580 MW Kemper IGCC plant being built by Mississippi  Power. The Vogtle nuclear units have been recovering the financing costs on  construction work in progress (CWIP) through a tracker since 2011. Fitch expects  that any adjustments to the overall project costs will be deemed recoverable by  the Georgia PSC. Significant project cost overruns that cannot be recovered in  rates or unexpected long deferral periods for project cost recovery would be  adverse credit factors.  The Kemper IGCC project has faced significant overruns relative to its original  project costs estimate. The project is now expected to cost $4.7 billion, of  which $853 million is subject to exemptions and exceptions from the regulatory  cost cap. Of the remaining $3.87 billion, Mississippi Power does not intend to  seek rate recovery for $990 million of costs incurred above the $2.88 billion  cost cap and has taken an equivalent charge to income in the year-to-date  financial results. Southern Company has committed to inject equity in  Mississippi Power to restore its capital structure.  Southern Company is planning to finance the approximately $1 billion equity  infusion into Mississippi Power largely through equity. Management has committed  to issue equity of $700 million in 2013 and $600 million in 2014. Management has  further committed to issue additional equity in 2015, if needed, to maintain the  consolidated equity ratio at the targeted 44% levels. The funding of Kemper cost  overruns primarily by equity is a key factor for Fitch's recent affirmation of  Southern Company's Issuer Default Rating and Stable Outlook. It is Fitch's  expectation that any future cost overruns at Kemper will be similarly funded  largely through equity such that the consolidated capital structure remains  within the targeted range. Fitch's financial projections assume that Kemper  becomes operational within the currently projected capital costs and schedule  and that the Mississippi PSC approves the seven-year plan proposed by  Mississippi Power to ensure rate stability for retail customers. Southern Company's consolidated environmental compliance expenditures remain  significant over Fitch's forecast period. The company is planning to spend  approximately $3.6 billion over 2013-2015 on environmental capex. All of  Southern Company's regulated subsidiaries, with the exception of Georgia Power,  have environmental trackers. Georgia Power has typically recovered environmental  compliance-related costs through base rate case decisions.  For the last 12 months (LTM) ending June 30, 2013, the funds flow from  operations (FFO)-to-total debt ratio stood at 21%, which includes the benefit of  bonus depreciation, and the adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio stood at 3.9x. Fitch  forecasts Southern Company's coverage ratios to remain strong, over 6.0x, which  reflects the declining benefit of bonus depreciation subsidies. Fitch expects  Southern Company's adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio to be approximately 3.5x and  FFO-to-adjusted debt to be approximately 21% by 2015. Incorporated in the  ratings is Fitch's expectation that Southern Company's financial measures will  remain weak through the large capex cycle at Georgia Power, its largest  subsidiary.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Actions: Fitch does not anticipate any positive rating actions  for Southern Company in the near future.  Project execution risk: Significant time/cost overrun at the Vogtle and/or  Kemper projects that are primarily debt financed and negative regulatory actions  on the recovery of those costs would be a trigger for downward rating actions.  Significant slowdown in sales: Weather-adjusted retail sales have declined 0.7%  year-to-date as compared to the same period last year. Residential and  commercial sales have continued to exhibit weakness while industrial sales are  beginning to firm up modestly. Lower than expected sales are a key factor in  both Gulf Power's and Georgia Power's pending rate increase request. Persistent  economic weakness and lower than expected sales across Southern Company's  utility subsidiaries could lead to weak consolidated credit metrics putting  pressure on ratings.  Unfavorable regulatory actions: Less than constructive outcomes in the pending  rate proceeding at Georgia Power can also lead to negative rating actions.

97,SO,"Southern Co's coal unit delayed, forfeits tax benefit","HOUSTON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Southern Co’s $5 billion project to build one of the first coal-fired power plants that captures carbon dioxide emissions will be delayed beyond May and so will miss out on $133 million in tax incentives, the company said in a filing. Rainy weather in the summer and low labor productivity will delay completion of the plant in Kemper County, Mississippi, until later in the year, Southern said on Wednesday, despite raising the project’s budget in July to meet the May deadline. Southern’s smallest utility unit, Mississippi Power, is building the 582-megawatt integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) plant near oil fields, meaning it can capture and inject underground the majority of carbon dioxide it emits to increase oil field production. The plant’s unique location, however, led Southern last month to caution regulators not to use it as a standard for future coal-fired plants. “The expected extension of the schedule beyond May 2014 reflects Southern Company’s and Mississippi Power’s current analysis of the time needed to complete the construction and start-up activities of the Kemper IGCC,” the companies said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The delay means Mississippi Power will not be eligible for $133 million in investment tax credits and potential future tax credits. A revised construction schedule and any resulting changes to cost will be detailed later this month, Southern said. Cost overruns have increased the plant’s price tag twice this year to nearly $5 billion, more than twice the initial estimate. As a consequence, two executives involved with the project have been replaced. Southern can recover $3.8 billion in related costs from Mississippi Power’s 185,000 customers. It said it anticipates no change to customer rates proposed under a plan approved earlier this year by the Mississippi Public Service Commission. In July, Southern increased the project’s budget by $450 million to keep it on schedule. Before that, it raised the budget by $540 million for additional piping systems critical to transfer fuel from the coal gasifier to the turbines that produce electricity. In early August, Mississippi Power began testing the plant’s auxiliary boiler which will turn water into steam. In late August and early September, workers began test-firing the  combustion turbines.",10032013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-southern-kemper/southern-cos-coal-unit-delayed-forfeits-tax-benefit-idUSL1N0HT01D20131003
98,SO,"Southern boosts cost, delays Mississippi Kemper coal plant start","Oct 30 (Reuters) - U.S. power company Southern Co  delayed the planned start-up date of its 582-megawatt Kemper coal-fired power plant in Mississippi to the fourth quarter of 2014 and boosted the estimated cost of the project again, to $4.02 billion. Southern said in a federal filing late on Tuesday that its Mississippi Power unit had revised the start-up date due to “lower-than-planned installation levels for piping as well as abnormally wet weather.” Kemper will use a new type of integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology to turn lignite coal into synthetic natural gas. The plant will also capture at least 65 percent of the carbon dioxide it produces as a byproduct. The carbon dioxide will be piped to an oilfield and used in oil production. Only a couple of other IGCC plants are in service in the United States - in Indiana and Florida. Those plants do not capture carbon dioxide emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as part of a proposal to limit carbon emissions from new power plants, has pointed to Kemper as an example of how new coal-fired plants can be built with capture-carbon and storage systems. Earlier this month, Southern said it had revised the plant’s start-up from May 2014 to “later in 2014.” In July it boosted the cost estimate for Kemper to $3.87 billion. Construction of the plant started in 2010. Reuters has estimated the project’s total cost will climb to about $5 billion when federal grants, the cost of the coal mine, the carbon dioxide pipeline system and other items are included. Despite the cost overruns, Southern said on Tuesday that Mississippi Power does not intend to seek any joint owner contributions or rate recovery for any costs related to the construction of Kemper that exceed the state’s $2.88 billion cost cap. Southern said it and Mississippi Power recorded a pre-tax charge of $150 million ($93 million after tax) related to Kemper in the third quarter, in addition to charges totaling $990 million ($611 million after tax) recognized previously. Southern also warned that “Mississippi Power could experience further schedule extensions and/or construction cost increases with respect to Kemper.” “To the extent it becomes probable that additional costs will not be recoverable, Southern and Mississippi Power will have additional charges to income, and such charges could be material,” the company said.",10302013,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-southern-kemper/southern-boosts-cost-delays-mississippi-kemper-coal-plant-start-idUSL1N0IK10L20131030
99,SO,Southern to repower three Alabama coal power plants with natgas,"Jan 16 (Reuters) - Southern Co’s Alabama Power unit plans to run three coal power plants with a total capacity over 1,600 megawatts on cleaner natural gas fuel in the coming years to comply with federal environmental rules. Alabama Power wants to add gas capability to the four 255-megawatt Units 1-4 at the Gaston coal plant in Alabama by 2016 so they can run primarily on gas going forward. Alabama Power said it wants to add gas capability to the units to comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), which requires power companies to reduce mercury and other air emissions. Since 2009, U.S. energy companies have shut or converted over 22,000 MW of coal-fired power plants. This is partly due to recently weak gas prices from record shale production making it uneconomic for generators to upgrade older and smaller coal units to meet increasingly strict federal and state environmental rules. Alabama Power’s four Gaston units will still have the ability to burn coal in case of some sort of gas emergency, but the company noted it was very unlikely the units will ever burn coal again. At the other Gaston unit, the 842-MW Unit 5, Alabama Power said it is adding a baghouse in 2016 so that unit will continue to use coal. Alabama Power said it applied for the Gaston air permits with state regulators in mid 2013. In addition, Alabama Power said it expects to be running both 65-MW Units 1 and 2 at the Gadsden coal and gas plant in Alabama on natural gas in 2015. The Gadsden plant already has the capability to run on either coal or gas. Alabama Power also expects the 138-MW Unit 1, 137-MW Unit 2 and 249-MW Unit 3 at the Barry coal plant in Alabama to be running on natural gas in 2016. The company said the Barry units will lose the capability to use coal going forward. Alabama Power currently operates about 13,600 MW of generating capacity, including about 8,000 MW from coal-fired units, 2,100 MW from gas, 1,700 MW from nuclear and 1,700 MW from hydro, according to federal data.",1162014,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-southern-alabama/southern-to-repower-three-alabama-coal-power-plants-with-natgas-idUSL2N0KP1WA20140116
100,SO,Southern Co working to finalize $8 billion nuclear loan guarantee,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Southern Co (SO.N) Chairman Tom Fanning said on Wednesday that the company is working with the U.S. Energy Department to finalize an $8.3 billion loan guarantee for its two-reactor expansion at the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia, the first new reactors to be built in three decades. Southern’s Georgia Power unit is leading a utility consortium that is building two 1,100-megawatt Westinghouse AP1000 reactors at a projected cost exceeding $14 billion. “After extensive negotiations on loan guarantees, Georgia power has delivered its documents to DOE,” Fanning said on a call with analysts. While a series of steps remain to close the federal loan, Fanning said the guarantee represents about $200 million in value to Georgia Power customers who are already paying early costs for the Vogtle units. The new reactors won’t begin producing power until late 2017 and late 2018, a year later than initially planned. Federal loan guarantees had been viewed as critical to the once-predicted revival of U.S. nuclear construction due to the regulatory risk and high cost of nuclear construction. Now, only a few new reactors are expected to be built due to lower natural gas prices, anemic growth in electricity demand and the lack of restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide. The only new U.S. reactors under construction are being built by the Georgia Power consortium and SCANA Corp (SCG.N), which is building two reactors in South Carolina. The Vogtle loan guarantee, announced in 2010, was expected to be finalized in 2012, but negotiations bogged down over terms and costs and were complicated by DOE requirements added after the much-publicized bankruptcy in 2011 of solar panel maker Solyndra which had received loan guarantees. Fanning said progress on Vogtle “is terrific.” He said construction is also going well at Mississippi Power’s coal-gasification power plant in Kemper County, Mississippi. Southern added $40 million to bolster its contingency funds for the Kemper plant as its total price tag is now above $5.2 billion, according to a filing with regulators made Tuesday. Fanning said Kemper’s gas turbines produced electricity in January using natural gas from its new pipeline as workers continue to install gasifier equipment which will eventually convert coal into synthesis gas to fuel the plant. “We will move towards testing of the gasifier in the second quarter,” Fanning said.

103,SO,Southern Co says Kemper coal plant costs still climbing,"HOUSTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Southern Co will take a $25 million charge in the 2013 fourth quarter as the cost for its coal-gasification power plant in Kemper County, Mississippi, climbs to more than $5 billion, the company said in a filing with regulators on Tuesday. Southern Co, based in Atlanta, is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Southern has previously taken $704 million in charges related to $1 billion in cost overruns at the 582-megawatt Kemper County plant, one of only two integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) plants in the nation. The power industry is closely watching progress at the Kemper plant. Because it will be able to capture carbon dioxide emissions, the Kemper plant has been cited as a model for future coal design by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which has proposed strict limits on carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. Southern said the latest cost increase “reflects an increase in the contingency for risks associated with start-up activities.” Mississippi Power, Southern’s smallest utility, owns the plant and can only recover up to $3.8 billion of the Kemper costs through customer rates and the sale of securitized bonds. Customers began paying higher rates related to the plant last year after a lengthy regulatory battle. At the time the plant was proposed, it was expected to cost about $2 billion. Completion of the Kemper plant has been delayed by about six months to the fourth quarter of 2014.",1292014,http://www.reuters.com/article/utilities-southern-kemper/southern-co-says-kemper-coal-plant-costs-still-climbing-idUSL2N0L300U20140129
104,SO,Investor group demands fossil fuel companies disclose carbon asset risk,"WASHINGTON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - A group of investors with combined assets of over $200 billion filed shareholder resolutions on Wednesday with ten energy companies, including Exxon Mobil and Southern Co, demanding they disclose their strategies for competing in a lower-carbon future. Led by the New York State Comptroller’s office, which alone handles $160 billion in assets, the investors focused on the companies’ “carbon asset risk,” or the potential for their carbon-intensive assets to lose value as market forces and potential regulation threaten demand for fossil fuels and related infrastructure. The move is part of an ongoing effort by some major institutional investors, coordinated by the sustainability advocacy group Ceres and the Investor Network on Climate Risk, that is focused on holding companies accountable for these so-called “stranded assets.” The activists have been asking companies whose fortunes are linked to fossil fuels to assess under both a business-as-usual and a low-carbon scenario the risk of stranded assets and the physical risk from the impacts of climate change. “The energy companies we invest in need to go back to the drawing board to determine the long-term financial risks that climate change poses to their business plans,” said New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. His office also filed shareholder resolutions with Devon Energy Corp, an oil and gas producer based in Oklahoma, and the Ohio-based utility FirstEnergy Corp. The bank HSBC said in a 2013 report that the equity valuation of some oil producers could drop by 40 to 60 percent under a low-carbon scenario, in which countries take measures to reach a long-term United Nations target for lower pollution. In order for the world to achieve the UN-agreed goal of limiting global temperature increases to 2 degrees C, the International Energy Agency said last year that no more than a third of the world’s proven fossil fuels can be consumed by 2050. “These companies are producing the vast majority of climate-changing emissions and now is the time for them to reduce risk,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, which works on corporate social responsibility issues with companies including Coca Cola, Chevron and HP. “If they are not preparing to survive in a carbon-constrained future, we expect shareholders will sit up and take notice,” Fugere said. In December, a report by the non-profit Climate Disclosure Project showed that many large U.S. companies, from oil majors to retailers, are including the potential for carbon emissions fees in their strategic plans.",2122014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-climate-disclosure/investor-group-demands-fossil-fuel-companies-disclose-carbon-asset-risk-idUSL2N0LH0PB20140212
105,SO,UPDATE 1-U.S. to finalize loan guarantee for Southern Co nuclear plant,"By Ayesha Rascoe WASHINGTON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - The Obama administration will finalize about $6.5 billion in loan guarantees this week for the nation’s first two new nuclear reactors in three decades, ending years of delay. U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz will travel to Waynesboro, Georgia, on Thursday to mark the completion of an agreement backing the construction of two new reactors at Southern Co’s Vogtle nuclear power plant, the Department of Energy announced on Wednesday. The department issued a conditional agreement for the Vogtle plant totaling $8.3 billion in 2010, offering loan aid to Southern’s Georgia Power unit as well as project co-owners Oglethorpe Power and Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG). While loan assistance to Georgia Power and Oglethorpe will be finalized, the planned $1.8 billion loan guarantee to MEAG remains outstanding. In a wide ranging speech at the National Press Club in Washington on Wednesday, Moniz said the Obama administration was committed to promoting innovations in energy technology that would help lower U.S. carbon dioxide emissions - but dodged questions on the Keystone XL pipeline and other contentious issues. Despite criticism of Energy Department’s loan program after the bankruptcy in 2011 of solar panel maker Solyndra, Moniz said the federal government must not be limited to strictly funding research and development. “The need to accelerate the pace of change in response to climate change makes it essential that we continue investments ... that get the first movers out there in commercial market pushing the technology envelope,” Moniz said. Originally expected to be finalized in 2012, the loan aid for the Vogtle expansion was held up by haggling over new conditions requested by the Obama administration in the wake of  Solyndra’s failure. Solar panel maker Solyndra folded after receiving a $535 million federal loan guarantee, leading to accusations that the Energy Department had mismanaged taxpayer dollars and favored political allies in doling out funds. When it was offered four years ago, the loan deal for Vogtle was supposed to herald a new era for the U.S. nuclear power sector, which had stalled after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Pennsylvania in 1979. Since then, surging U.S. natural gas production, weak growth in electricity demand  and the lack of a cap on carbon emissions have dampened expectations for a nuclear renaissance. Only a few nuclear plants are expected to be built and Vogtle is the only nuclear power plant to be offered a federal loan guarantee so far. With “substantial” funding authority still available, Moniz did not rule out additional loan guarantees. He said the department plans to move ahead with the loan program to back deserving low-carbon projects across the energy spectrum.",2192014,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-nuclear-southern/update-1-u-s-to-finalize-loan-guarantee-for-southern-co-nuclear-plant-idUSL2N0LO1VY20140219

111,SO,Southern Co finds more labor issues at Kemper coal plant - filing,"HOUSTON, April 2 (Reuters) - Southern Co’s  Mississippi Power unit said it has identified more labor and construction problems at its $5 billion coal-gasification power project in Kemper County, Mississippi, the company said in a filing with regulators on Wednesday. Mississippi Power said it was reviewing additional cost overruns related to lower construction productivity at the 582-megawatt Kemper County plant, one of only two integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) plants in the country. The productivity problems were “due in large part to adverse weather, unexpected excessive craft labor turnover and unanticipated installation inefficiencies,” the utility said in a statement. Mississippi Power said it has identified at least $177 million in likely cost increases, including $152 million in construction costs and $25 million in start-up costs. Such added costs would push the estimated price tag for the delayed Kemper plant to $5.22 billion, well above the $2.88 billion construction cap approved by the Mississippi Public Service Commission. Completion of the Kemper plant has been delayed by about six months to the fourth quarter. Southern has previously taken $704 million in charges related to rising costs at Kemper which has been cited as a model for future coal-plant design by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as it works to limit carbon pollution from coal plants. Southern Co officials have asked the EPA not to use Kemper as a standard for the industry. U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz toured the site in November.

Southern Co, based in Atlanta, is scheduled to release its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Southern has previously taken $729 million in charges related to more than $1 billion in cost overruns at the 582-megawatt Kemper County plant, one of only two integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) plants in the nation. Mississippi Power, Southern’s smallest utility, owns the facility and plans to complete the gas-fired, combined cycle portion of the project this summer. However, the in-service date for Kemper’s complex gasification system has been delayed to the first half of 2015, one year later than initially planned. “The company remains focused on working safely and tirelessly to complete the facility and bring it online for the benefit of customers for decades to come,” Mississippi Power said in a statement. The power industry has been closely watching progress at the Kemper plant. Because it will be able to capture carbon dioxide emissions, the Kemper plant has been cited as a model for future coal-plant design by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency which has proposed strict limits on carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants. However, Southern officials have asked the EPA to refrain from using Kemper as a standard for the industry because of its unique location. Southern blamed the latest cost overrun on lower construction productivity due to adverse weather at the site, unexpected worker turnover and installation “inefficiencies” related to the complex piping in the gasification system. Earlier this year, Southern reported additional construction costs of $184 million. On Tuesday, the company revised its cost estimate by another $61 million and added $135 million related to the delay in the expected in-service date. With the $380 million increase, Kemper’s price tag now exceeds $5.53 billion, more that twice the $2 billion figure announced when the plant was proposed.

113,SO,Southern hopes to build more U.S. nuclear power reactors,"(Reuters) - Southern Co, one of the biggest U.S. power companies, said it hopes to announce plans by the end of the year to build more nuclear reactors, a spokesman said late Wednesday. That makes Southern the first company to pursue new reactors since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced plans earlier this year to reduce carbon emissions from existing power plants to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Nuclear reactors produce almost no carbon emissions. The company is already building two new 1,117-megawatt reactors at its Vogtle nuclear site in Georgia and Southern Chief Executive Tom Fanning said any new reactors would be of the same Westinghouse AP1000 design. Westinghouse is majority owned by Toshiba Corp, a Japanese conglomerate. Fanning made his comments on Wednesday on the sidelines of a conference in Washington held by the Bipartisan Policy Center, according to a report from Platts. The company is evaluating six possible sites for additional reactors, including existing plants and greenfield locations, Fanning said at the conference. The Vogtle units under construction cost about $14 billion but delays related to licensing have added about $381 million, Southern said. In the past it has taken years to gain the federal and state approvals needed to build a new reactors. Southern applied with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build the Vogtle units now under construction in 2008 and finally gained NRC approval in 2012. Southern expects the first new Vogtle reactor to enter service in late 2017 or early 2018, with the second unit on about a year later. More than a dozen companies have considered construction of new reactors since the so-called nuclear renaissance in the early 2000s when the U.S. government was expected to adopt rules to limit carbon emissions and the cost of fossil fuels like natural gas were high. But until now the government has failed to adopt carbon regulations and gas prices have plunged as the increased use of hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling and other new technologies has opened up the nation’s shale fields for economic development. Only Southern and Scana Corp, which is building two AP1000 reactors in South Carolina, are actually building new nuclear units.

Southern applied with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build the Vogtle units now under construction in 2008 and finally gained NRC approval in 2012. Southern expects the first new Vogtle reactor to enter service in late 2017 or early 2018, with the second unit on about a year later. More than a dozen companies have considered construction of new reactors since the so-called nuclear renaissance in the early 2000s when the U.S. government was expected to adopt rules to limit carbon emissions and the cost of fossil fuels like natural gas were high. But until now the government has failed to adopt carbon regulations and gas prices have plunged as the increased use of hydraulic fracturing, horizontal drilling and other new technologies has opened up the nation’s shale fields for economic development. Only Southern and Scana Corp, which is building two AP1000 reactors in South Carolina, are actually building new nuclear units.

116,SO,Southern crops hold the key to U.S. soybean outlook: Maguire,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture will provide its first state-level assessments of U.S. soybean production potential on Aug. 12, and traders will watch for projections on production potential among the top Midwest growing states as crops there enter their most critical and rain-dependent development phase. However, much of the crop grown across the U.S. South is in a far more advanced state than that grown across top Midwest states such as Iowa and Illinois. Southern crops could be available weeks ahead of Midwestern supplies. The quantities are substantial. The top 10 growing states across the South produced a record 658 million bushels of soybeans in 2013 and are on course to top 700 million bushels this year thanks to a 12 percent climb in planted area from a year ago and kind growing conditions so far this season. So market trackers gauging the scope and vulnerability of the 2014 U.S. crop must not overlook the advanced state and scale of southern production. Growers there could well fulfill a large share of near-term demand weeks before the majority of the national crop is even ready for harvest. Helping drive the climb in southern soybean production in recent years has been the steady climb in crop yields, as the region’s growers have enjoyed bigger productivity gains than their more established counterparts in the Midwest. While planted acres across the top 10 soybean producing states have grown around 20 percent since 1990 to 17.9 million acres, production in the South has grown by close to 100 percent due to a 70 percent climb in crop yields. These output advances compare with a 16 percent climb in yields and a 50 percent rise in production in the top five states in the Midwest over the same period. Southern growers have been effective at implementing modern practices and techniques in soy production. As crop production in the South has improved, growers there have had to become adept at marketing their bountiful supplies. Southern states have far fewer traditional soybean demand centers such as crushing facilities than the Midwest. But thanks to the earlier start to the growing season, Southern growers can offer their crops to consumers much earlier than their Midwestern counterparts. Crop originators have been willing to do business with Southern growers in increasing tonnages in recent years, even though those supplies are often farther away from most domestic crushers. Exporters have also shown a keen interest in Southern supplies. Earlier availability and the shorter hauling distance to major ports in the U.S. Gulf helps these crops compete for overseas consumer demand against foreign sellers. Combined, these consumers have ensured steady demand for Southern soybeans, enticing producers to keep dialing up acreage and production across the region. The upcoming USDA report is expected to reveal that Southern growers are on course to deliver a record amount of fresh supplies again this year, which will likely be available to consumers and exporters weeks ahead of the crops grown across the more established areas. If the USDA also reveals that Midwest growers are set to harvest record crops this year, Southern growers could enjoy a big advantage in being able to deliver their crops to market well ahead of the competition. At the very least, the more advanced state of the Southern crop should give producers there greater confidence to secure sales deals, as Midwest growers remain uncertain of their crop’s potential. So market trackers looking for clarity on the outlook for the U.S. soybean market must pay close attention to the South, as a record amount of supplies are set to emerge from the region this year. This could plug demand until the rest of the U.S. crop becomes ready in the fall and potentially set the stage for a downward leg in crop prices.

118,SO,Southern soybean growers steal a march on the Midwest - Maguire,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The 10 largest soybean growing states in the U.S. South collectively produced a record 775 million bushels of the crop this year, and are well on their way to bringing those supplies to market weeks ahead of growers in the Eastern Corn Belt where harvest is being delayed due to wet weather. Southern growers are able to get their crops planted and grown sooner than their Midwestern counterparts in most years, due to warmer year-round temperatures. But last year soggy field conditions delayed harvest in many Southern areas, depriving growers there of the chance to capitalize on the strong export demand in place during the first quarter of the 2013-14 marketing season. This year, Southern growers have been able to harvest their soybeans at a much faster pace than a year ago, and so are in a strong position to participate fully in the strongest export period of the year, and may potentially displace traditional Corn Belt supplies. Southern growers have been dialing up soybean plantings and production intentions for the past 6-8 years in response to the relatively stronger price performance of soybeans compared to more traditional Southern crops such as rice and cotton. However, Southern producers have had uneven success rates in terms of soy output, as volatile weather conditions, pests and less crop experience compared to the heart of the Midwest resulted in as many production contractions as expansions on a year-over-year basis over the past decade. That said, the strong soybean prices of 2012 and 2013 paved the way toward a more concerted push into soybeans lately, resulting in a record 17.75 million acres being planted in the crop for the 2014 season across the top 10 southern growing states. Relatively benign weather, coupled with the widespread adoption of improved management techniques, seeds and technologies, also helped propel Sothern output higher, with this year’s collective tally surpassing the 700 million bushel total for the first time and accounting for roughly 20 percent of the national soybean total.  With soybean harvest well past the 60 percent mark in states such as Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana, much of that fresh production is already refilling the national supply pipeline, and potentially on its way to domestic and overseas purchasers. For many growers across the South, this is a welcome contrast to the situation last year when wet fields prevented many from being able to access their crops and forced them to stand and watch as growers located farther north tapped into the record-strong export demand that prevailed late last year. And timeliness is not the only benefit that Southern soy growers are gaining this year. Closer proximity to Southern export ports is also making their crops more competitive relative to those available farther afield, as brokers and traders can cut down on the cost - and time - of getting those supplies to the export market. Indeed, the current availability of Southern soybean supplies has prompted exporters to step up competition for them, which has driven up the spot cash price of soybeans in places like Arkansas and Louisiana to a rare premium to Decatur, Illinois and other central Midwest locations. For soybean producers in the Midwest, the combination of a slow local harvest alongside above-normal progress in the South has resulted not only in weaker cash prices for their crops, but also a risk that they may miss the most active export season of the year.  Soybean exporters traditionally secure roughly 60-70 percent of their full-year export deals within the October to December period, and so those producers who are not able to make their supplies available during that time window risk selling at a time when overall demand may be less competitive.  What’s more, with South America having overtaken North America as the primary soybean producer, U.S. growers who miss the export window risk selling their supplies during a period when other origins are the chief price setters, which could be at a discount to U.S. levels. For this reason, Southern soybean growers are likely to be relieved that they have been able to get most of their supplies harvested already this season – even if prices are well below where they were at this point in 2013. For growers still dealing with wet fields in the Midwest, there is still time for conditions to improve enough to get the rest of harvest wrapped up and their supplies to market.  But if Eastern Corn Belt fields stay soggy for much longer, many Midwest growers may miss out on this year’s export season, and lose market share to their Southern counterparts.
