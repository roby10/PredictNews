1,PM,UPDATE 4-Pricier cigarettes boost BAT's first-half profits," * H1 earnings 96.1p vs consensus forecast 95.1p   * Sees another very good year in 2011   * H1 cigarette volumes decline 1 percent   * Sees one-off benefit from Japan   * Share price up 0.9 percent in lower market   (Adds details from briefing, updates shares)	   By David Jones	   LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - British American Tobacco  raised its cigarette prices sharply in the first half of the year and saw a one-off boost from Japan, helping it lift profits by a better than expected 10 percent despite a fall in sales volumes.	   The London-based maker of Kent, Dunhill, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall cigarettes said the price increases of nearly 8 percent helped offset a 1 percent fall in sales volumes to push underlying revenue up 7 percent.	   BAT, the world’s second-biggest cigarette maker and most globally spread of the big tobacco groups, said its ability to raise prices even in low growth markets put it in good shape for growth for 2011 as many economies come out of recession.	   Chief Executive Nicandro Durante said signs of recovery in key markets, volume declines moderating and higher pricing put the group on “on track for another very good year”.	   “The recovery is dependent on the economies of our markets and in Russia and other key markets the rate of volume decline is moderating,” Durante told a briefing on Wednesday.	   Second-quarter cigarette volumes showed only a 0.2 percent fall after a decline of 1.8 percent in the first three months of 2011, as many economies around the world recovered and the group grew share in many markets.	   The group posted half-year adjusted diluted earnings per share of 96.1 pence, ahead of market consensus forecast of 95.1 pence according to a company-compiled survey of analysts.	   The half-year dividend, set at one third of 2010’s full year level, rose 15 percent to 38.1 pence.	   UBS analyst Jonathan Leinster said that after these strong results came ahead of forecasts he expected the full-year  consensus forecast for earnings would rise 1-2 percent from the current level of around 193 pence a share.	   BAT’s shares were up 0.9 percent at 28.88 pounds by 1435 GMT, when the FTSE 100 index was down 1.3 percent.	   “We view this as a very strong result from BAT that testifies to the stock’s defensive qualities. Given difficult H1 trading in the foods and home and personal care sector we continue to see tobacco, and BAT in particular, as a strong	 defensive refuge,” said analyst Martin Deboo at Investec Securities.	   BAT has suffered falling volumes as smokers have switched to cheap, and sometimes illicit cigarettes following excise tax rises and high unemployment levels, but the underlying volumes picture has started to improve.	   In Japan the group saw a one-off gain from the disruptions to production by domestic maker Japan Tobacco caused by the tsunami in March, with BAT gaining sales of 2 billion cigarettes and a profit of 50 million pounds as it supplies the that market with imports from the United States.	   This boosted BAT’s Japan market share to 20 percent from 10 percent previously, but Durante said he expected Japan Tobacco to recovery most of the share it had lost.	   BAT has been protected from the downturn by its wide geographical spread of businesses, with the economies of its five top markets of Brazil, Russia, Canada, Australia and South Africa enjoying higher commodity prices.	   In contrast smaller British rival Imperial Tobacco  has been hit by a price war and weak market in Spain, its third biggest market which accounted for nearly 10 percent of all its profits last year, whereas BAT is also major player in Spain but only earns less than one percent of its profits there.	   BAT confirmed it was looking at state controlled Bulgarian cigarette maker Bulgartabak after the state privatisation agency said on Tuesday it expected BAT and Austrian-registered BT Invest to bid for the group in a 100 million euro auction.	   “It will come as no surprise that we are looking at it, but I would not hold your breath,” said BAT finance director Ben Stevens.	   BAT, the world’s second biggest tobacco group behind Marlboro-maker Philip Morris International , said its first-half adjusted operating profit rose 12 percent to 2.7 billion pounds while overall revenue increased 2 percent to 7.4 billion pounds.

2,PM,UPDATE 3-Tobacco firms lose major Canada liability ruling,"   * Ruling means Ottawa not liable for billions in damages   * Tobacco companies wanted government to share costs   * Several provinces plan big law suits  (Adds reaction from Imperial Tobacco)   By David Ljunggren   OTTAWA, July 29 (Reuters) - Tobacco companies suffered a major defeat in Canada on Friday when the Supreme Court ruled the federal government is not liable for damages from health-related lawsuits, possibly amounting to many billions of dollars.   The tobacco industry — facing suits from several Canadian provinces seeking to recoup healthcare costs — had argued that Ottawa had allowed and regulated the use of tobacco and should therefore take at least some of the responsibility.   In a unanimous 9-0 judgment, the court disagreed.   “When Canada directed the tobacco industry about how it should conduct itself, it was doing so in its capacity as a government regulator that was concerned about the health of Canadians,” the judgment said.   “Under such circumstances it is unreasonable to infer that Canada was implicitly promising to indemnify the industry for acting on its request.”   The case deals with a suit by the province of British Columbia against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co RAI.N, Japan Tobacco’s (2914.T) JTI-Macdonald unit, Rothmans Benson & Hedges Inc, which is partly owned by Philip Morris (PM.N), and Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd, a unit of British American Tobacco (BATS.L).   The Supreme Court said the tobacco companies had failed to prove Ottawa had any liability in British Columbia.   Imperial Tobacco said the court had decided the federal government was not accountable for its decisions and actions.   “We nonetheless intend to set the record straight and believe it is important for the government of Canada to answer for its long and sustained involvement in the tobacco industry,” spokesman Donald McCarty said in a release.   Anti-smoking campaigners welcomed what they said was a massive setback for the tobacco companies.   “The rewards for provinces at the end of the day are very significant,” said Rob Cunningham, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.   In Canada, the public healthcare system is administered by each of the 10 provinces. Several of them have sued or say they will sue the tobacco industry but British Columbia filed first and Canadian courts are using its case as the lead case. None of the suits has come to trial yet.   British Columbia has declined to say how much money it is seeking in damages. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, launched a suit against the companies in 2009 seeking C$50 billion ($53 billion).   In a separate but similar case, the Supreme Court also ruled against Imperial Tobacco, which wanted Ottawa to be liable for any damages awarded in suits alleging the company wrongly marketed some tobacco products as “mild” or “light”.   The court dismissed Imperial’s argument that Canada should be responsible for any damages awarded because it had urged the companies to develop mild and light tobacco products.   The judges said this had been a “core government policy decision” that could not be challenged in court.   (The main case is Attorney General of Canada v.

4,PM,Canada's top court to rule on tobacco liability,"   * Ruling could mean Ottawa liable for billions in damages   * Tobacco firms say government should share costs   OTTAWA, July 29 (Reuters) - Canada’s Supreme Court will decide on Friday whether the federal government should be partly liable for damages, possibly amounting to many billions of dollars, stemming from lawsuits against tobacco firms.   The tobacco industry — facing suits from several provinces seeking to recoup healthcare costs — says that, if it loses, the government should pay at least part of the damages because Ottawa allowed and regulated the use of tobacco.   The court is scheduled to deliver its ruling at 9:45 Eastern (1345 GMT).   Ottawa is fighting a decision by an appeals court in the province of British Columbia, which ruled in 2009 that the federal government should be a co-defendant and therefore share in any liability awarded by the province’s courts.   British Columbia is suing R.J.

6,PM,Big tobacco to take Australia packaging fight to higher court,"CANBERRA (Reuters) - Cigarette giant British American Tobacco (BAT) plans to appeal an Australian court ruling that handed the tobacco industry a setback in its campaign against the world’s first ban on branded cigarette packaging.  The Australian government is legislating to enforce plain packaging for cigarettes in a bid to reduce smoking, angering the industry which has described the reform as a misguided attack on their brands and intellectual property rights.  After the plan was first announced, BAT asked the Federal Court to force the government to release its secret legal advice on the plan, suspecting Canberra’s own lawyers had warned it long ago that such a move would infringe on property rights.  The industry hopes such advice would strengthen its case for a legal challenge against the validity of the proposed law, which is expected to be approved by parliament this year.  “We are definitely looking to appeal and will try to get to the High Court as soon as possible,” Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for BAT’s Australian arm, told Reuters.  “We are thinking that if they are not prepared to release it, maybe it’s because it demonstrates that the plain packaging laws are flawed.”  Another tribunal last week rejected a similar request for government legal documents by U.S.-based Philip Morris.  Health Minister Nicola Roxon said on Wednesday the government was determined to implement the plain-packaging reform, which is due to take effect next year and give Australia the world’s most restrictive anti-smoking laws.  “I don’t really think it’s helping them but ultimately they’ve been clear that they will fight this tooth and nail and we’ve been just as clear that we won’t let them bully us into stopping this,” Roxon said.  The lower house of parliament, where the government has a one-seat majority with the backing of Green and independent MPs, began considering the laws on Wednesday.  The conservative opposition wants some changes to allow some very modest form of branding on cigarette packets, but it too is broadly in favor of the reform.  New Zealand, Canada, the European Union and Britain are considering similar laws and governments in those countries are closely watching to see if Australia succeeds.  Analysts say plain packaging could also spread to emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and Indonesia.  Australia’s total tobacco market revenue grew to about $10 billion in 2009, though smoking generally has been in decline.  Smoking is the largest preventable cause of disease and death in the country.

The Czech company said on Monday that revenue rose 1.5 percent to 5.62 billion crowns, but that shipments in the Czech and Slovak markets, where it operates, remained under pressure by consumers moving to cheaper products.   Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected net profit at 1.18 billion crowns on revenue of 5.76 billion.   The firm, majority owned by Philip Morris International (PM.N), said its Czech market share fell by 2.4 percentage points to 52.3 percent, according to AC Nielsen data, which it said reflected a move to lower-margin products.

9,PM,UPDATE 2-Imperial Tobacco hurt by Spanish price war," * Imperial sees annual tobacco revenue up 2 pct   * Annual cigarette volume expected down 2 pct   * Spain results to benefit from recent price increases   * Trading overall in line with group expectations   * Shares up 1.9 percent in early trade   (Adds details, shares)	   By David Jones	   LONDON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Imperial Tobacco Plc , the world’s fourth-largest cigarette group, expects sales to rise just 2 percent in the current year after being hurt by a savage price war in Spain, though recent price rises may ease the pain there.	   Imperial is market leader in Spain with a near 30 percent  share from brands like Fortuna, Ducados and Nobel, but suffered from a market depressed by economic woes and a 2011 ban on smoking in public places which sparked a price war this year.	   Analysts say the outlook for 2012 has improved in the Iberian market, Imperial’s third most profitable market after Britain and Germany, as all major tobacco players there have recently increased cigarette prices.	   Imperial’s annual sales rise was in line with expectations and was unlikely to lead to any major changes to earnings forecasts, analysts said, and the group said on Wednesday its performance in the year to Sept. 30 remained in line with its expectations.	   Imperial shares rose 1.9 percent to 21.33 pounds by 0705 GMT in a lower London stock market .	   The Bristol-based group, which also makes Gauloises, West and Lambert & Butler cigarettes, said in a trading update that growth was particularly strong in eastern Europe, Asia Pacific and EU markets outside Britain, Germany and Spain.	   The company expects annual sales, excluding Spain and the impact of a UK price increase, to rise around 3 percent compared with overall annual sales at constant exchange rates seen up 2 percent.	   The group, which makes over 300 billion cigarettes annually, sees cigarette volumes declining in the 12-month period by around 2 percent, but excluding Spain and the UK price rise effect then volumes are seen down by less than 1 percent.	   Imperial raised its cigarette prices in Spain in July and September, alongside price increases by the world’s three biggest players — Philip Morris International , British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco .	   Analysts expect earnings for the year through September 2011 of 187.3 pence a share, according to Reuters SmartEstimates, compared with the previous year’s figure of 178.8p.

11,PM,"Canada unveils larger, graphic anti-smoking labels","OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada unveiled some of the world’s largest and most graphic anti-smoking labels on Tuesday on the grounds that smokers were starting to ignore existing warnings on cigarette packs.  The new labels have to cover 75 percent of the front and back of each pack of cigarettes and small cigars, and will be mandatory by the middle of next year. Existing anti-smoking labels cover 50 percent of a pack.  The 16 labels include pictures of a woman dying of lung cancer in a hospital bed, a man with a hole in this throat after surgery for smoking-related larynx cancer, and a close-up shot of a diseased and cancerous tongue.  “We want to make the images larger and more noticeable and more understandable ... The images are pretty gross. They can be a little bit scary as well, but that is the reality of smoking,” said federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.  “Over time, people get used to seeing the old pictures so we want to grab people’s attention once again,” she said at an event to unveil the images.  The new labels can be seen here#cigarettes  Tobacco manufacturers and importers will have until March 21 2012 to switch over to the new labels and retailers must only carry packs with the bigger warnings by June 19.  “It’s fantastic ... the evidence is that the larger the size (of the label), the larger the impact,” said Rob Cunningham, a policy analyst at the Canadian Cancer Society.  Only Uruguay, which requires warning labels to cover 80 percent of a package, has tougher regulations, he said.  The adult smoking rate in Canada fell to a record low 17 percent in 2010 from 24 percent in 2000, a year before the first warning labels started to appear.  The Canadian Public Health Association welcomed the move, while noting that smoking was “the single most preventable cause of disease, disability and premature death in Canada.”  In the United States, several large tobacco companies are suing the federal Food and Drug Administration for requiring more graphic health warnings on packages no later than September 2012. The labels variously include pictures of bodies, diseased lungs and rotting teeth.  Major producers of tobacco sold in Canada include R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co, Japan Tobacco’s JTI-Macdonald unit, Rothmans Benson & Hedges Inc, which is partly owned by Philip Morris and Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd, a unit of British American Tobacco.  Imperial Tobacco said the new labels were “poor policy for political gain” and would not cut the number of smokers.  “We ... believe that the health risks have been known for decades and that the existing regulations, including the 50 percent health warning, provide sufficient information to consumers in order for them to make an informed decision,” said company spokesman Eric Gagnon.

13,PM,Norway cigarette-display ban may set precedent-paper," OSLO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - A Norwegian law banning cigarette displays in stores could set an international precedent when a legal challenge by tobacco giant Philip Morris resumes in December, a Norwegian newspaper said.	   Government attorney Kjetil Boe Moen said Norway’s law requiring most stores to hide their cigarettes   remained strong after an ambiguous opinion two weeks ago by a European Free Trade Association (EFTA) court, newspaper Nationen said on Tuesday.	   Philip Morris has sued Norway’s Ministry of Health and Care Services in the Oslo District Court, claiming the 2009 prohibition violates free trade principles that bind Norway as a member of the European Economic Area (EEA).	   As part of the case, the Oslo court asked the EFTA court for an advisory ruling that was issued on Sept. 12.	   The tribunal in Luxembourg said restrictions to protect health were permitted under EEA rules, but that Norway’s display ban might be a violation if less draconian measures would achieve the same goal.	   Philip Morris took the opinion as support for its challenge.	   “Now the state must prove that the measure is necessary in the sense that other, less restrictive measures would not have at least as good effect,” Nordan Helland, Philip Morris Norway’s communications director, told Nationen.	   Norway is not a member of the European Union but its membership in the EEA — along with Iceland and Liechtenstein — requires it to follow most EU trade rules in exchange for market access for Norwegian exports.

15,PM,"Japan Tobacco hits 3-year high, govt eyes sale of entire stake","TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares of Japan Tobacco Inc (JT) (2914.T) rose as much as 8 percent before giving up gains on Wednesday after the government said it was looking to sell its entire 50 percent stake, a move seen giving management greater freedom in business decisions.  The decision, part of efforts to find funds to rebuild northeast Japan after the March earthquake and tsunami, marks a major change from previous debate that had focused on reducing the government’s holding to a third. [ID:nL3E7KR1YN]  The sale of the government’s JT shares, which it values at 1.7 trillion yen ($22.2 billion), would take place in two stages, following necessary legislative changes that would require the agreement of opposition parties. It would first be cut to one-third over the next five years, and then the rest would be sold over another five years.  “Completely privatizing JT, and other companies, would give them a free hand to make business decisions for themselves,” said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.  The news sent shares of the maker of Mild Seven cigarettes as high as 396,500 yen in early trade, their highest since October 2008, before falling to 365,500 yen, an 0.4 percent drop from Tuesday’s close.  Japan Tobacco was the heaviest-traded issue by turnover, with morning trading reaching one and a half times its 30-day full-day average.  JT shares have rallied 14 percent since July 25, when senior politician Katsuya Okada mentioned the government might cut its stake, on views the move would lead to share buybacks and a subsequent lifting of shareholder returns.  On Tuesday, a top JT executive said the firm, which has been calling for the government to offload its stake for years, would buy back some shares offered by the government.  In the year to June 30, JT’s return on equity was 8.9 percent, while Philip Morris International (PM.N) returned 203.3 percent and British American Tobacco (BAT) (BATS.L) gave back 37.8 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed.  Over the same period, JT’s dividend yield, at 1.7 percent, was lower than Phillip Morris’ 3.8 percent and BAT’s 4.4 percent.  But it is unknown what effect a government sell down of its JT stake would have on regulations that set cigarette prices and require the world’s No.3 cigarette maker to buy all tobacco leaf grown in Japan.  Democratic Party policy chief Seiji Maehara also proposed raising about 700-800 billion yen by selling energy-related shares held by the government, which include Inpex Corp (1605.T) and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co (Japex) (1662.T).  Based on the agreement reached by the government and ruling party agreement, the Democrats will discuss the measures and the extra budget with a small coalition partner and then begin talks with opposition parties, which control the upper house of parliament and can block bills.  The government aims to submit the third extra budget, of which 9.1 trillion yen will be allocated for reconstruction, to parliament next month.

16,PM,Australia seeks world backing on tobacco legal fight,"CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia is confident the world’s toughest anti-tobacco laws will soon pass parliament, but the government warned on Thursday that the anti-smoking fight was not over and urged other nations to reject a possible WTO challenge backed by big tobacco.  Health Minister Nicola Roxon said the minority government was bracing not only for a court challenge to its plan to force cigarettes to be sold in plain packaging from 2012, but also an intellectual property dispute at the World Trade Organization.  “A tobacco company themselves can’t bring a claim in the WTO. A state has to do that,” Roxon told Reuters in an interview.  “I won’t be surprised if tobacco companies are out there looking for a country to claim on their behalf, and we urge countries not to do that.”  The new laws, expected to easily pass parliament next week with backing from the conservative opposition and Green crossbench senators, are being closely watched by New Zealand, Canada, the European Union and Britain, which are considering similar restrictions.  The legislation is in two parts, one of which mandates that cigarettes can only be sold in plain olive green packaging and another part restricting tobacco company trademarks.  The pathfinding plan has infuriated tobacco firms including Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco, which have threatened a High Court challenge. Tobacco nations like Nicaragua, Kenya and Ukraine also say the measures breach global trade rules.  Despite political unease at home over potential compensation claims that tobacco companies have said could mount to billions of dollars, Roxon has been a passionate advocate for the laws within the Labor government, which has a one-seat buffer with the backing of Green and independent MPs.  Her father, Jack, a one-time smoker, died of esophageal cancer at 42, when Roxon was just 10, leaving her pharmacist mother alone to raise three daughters.  “Big tobacco companies do have big tentacles that reach far and wide across the world. I’ve made very clear to my international colleagues that they need to look at this not only from a health perspective, but from a trade perspective,” Roxon, now 44, said.  Australia says the new laws reflect its obligations under the World Health Organization’s 2005 framework against tobacco, which urges states to consider plain packaging laws. The WHO estimates more than 1 billion around the world are regular smokers, with 80 percent in low and middle income countries.  Industry analysts say tobacco companies are worried that plain packaging could spread to emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and Indonesia, and threaten growth there.  In Britain, tobacco companies have been fighting in courts for the right to sell cigarettes in vending machines, while tobacco companies in the U.S. are challenging more graphic health warnings on cigarette packets, claiming the changes violate their right of free speech.  An Australia parliamentary committee looking into the legislation and possible grounds for a legal contest received submissions from as far afield as Europe and Kenya, and even cigarette retailers in Peru and Rio de Janeiro.  “We don’t know how much (tobacco firms) seek to influence other players, but we certainly become suspicious when you see comments made by people apparently completely disconnected to Australia ... when the lines are exactly reflecting — almost parroting — tobacco companies,” Roxon said.  Australia’s tobacco market generated total revenues of around $10 billion in 2009, up from A$8.3 billion in 2008, although smoking generally has been in decline. Around 22 billion cigarettes are sold in the country each year.  Australia wants to cut the number of people who smoke from around 15 percent of the population to 10 percent by 2018. Health authorities say smoking kills 15,000 Australians each year with social and health costs of around $32 billion.  Roxon said she had experienced enormous support from other health ministers at a recent United Nations health meeting in New York, and was sharing Australia’s legal preparations with other nations likely to follow Canberra’s plain-pack lead.  “Ultimately that’s going to be worrying the tobacco companies, but that is absolutely going to be better for consumers and people who would otherwise be future patients,” she said.

18,PM,Philip Morris challenges Australia on plain pack,"CANBERRA (Reuters) - Tobacco giant Philip Morris on Monday launched legal action against Australian laws forcing tobacco products to be sold in drab, plain packaging from late next year. Australia’s parliament has passed laws compelling cigarettes, pipe tobacco and cigars to be sold in plain olive packs from December 2012. Tobacco export countries including Nicaragua, Dominican Republic and Ukraine have warned they may challenge under world trade rules, while tobacco companies including British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco, have said they may challenge the law in Australia’s High Court. Philip Morris said it had launched legal action that could trigger compensation claims worth billions of dollars. “The Government has passed this legislation despite being unable to demonstrate that it will be effective at reducing smoking and has ignored the widespread concerns raised in Australia and internationally regarding the serious legal issues associated with plain packaging,” Philip Morris spokeswoman Anne Edwards said in a statement. The action is being brought by Philip Morris Asia Ltd, Hong Kong, the owner of the Australian affiliate, through a notice of arbitration under Australia’s Bilateral Investment Treaty with Hong Kong. The laws are being closely watched by governments considering similar moves in Europe, Canada and New Zealand, angering tobacco companies worried that they may set a global precedent and infringe on trademark rights. The Himalayan nation of Bhutan banned the sale of tobacco outright earlier this year. Australia’s Health Minister Nicola Roxon, speaking after parliament’s lower house approved laws already passed by the upper house Senate last week, demanded tobacco companies respect the will of the parliament. “Plain packaging means that the glamour is gone from smoking and cigarettes are now exposed for what they are: killer products that destroy thousands of Australian families,” Roxon told reporters. Roxon said while the tobacco industry was fighting to protect its profits, the government was “fighting to protect lives.” The World Health Organization in 2005 urged countries to consider plain packaging, and estimated more than 1 billion are regular smokers, 80 percent of them in poor countries. Industry analysts say tobacco companies are worried that plain packaging could spread to important emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and Indonesia, and threaten growth there. Legal experts have predicted both legal and WTO challenges to fail, as intellectual property rights agreements give governments the right to pass laws to protect public health. Conservative opposition MPs, while backing the laws, urged Roxon to accept a three month moratorium on prosecutions and the enforcement of heavy fines for small tobacco sellers to give them time to adjust to the possible impact on sales. Australia already bans tobacco advertising, smoking in public buildings and the public display of cigarettes in shops. In some states, it is illegal to smoke in a car if a child is a passenger. Australia wants to cut the number of people who smoke from around 15 percent of the population to 10 percent by 2018. Health authorities say smoking kills 15,000 Australians each year with social and health costs of around $32 billion.

The laws, past by parliament last month, are being watched closely by governments in Europe, Canada and New Zealand, who see Australia as a test case. They have angered tobacco firms who fear they may set a global precedent and infringe on trademark rights. “The High Court of Australia will now determine claims which include the validity of these unprecedented laws. Unchallenged, the Australian government would otherwise be able to simply take the intellectual property of legal entities,” Imperial Tobacco Australia General Manager Melvin Ruigrok said in a statement. British American Tobacco launched a separate High Court challenge last week, while Philip Morris launched international action last month through its office in Hong Kong. Philip Morris, the world’s largest cigarette maker measured by sales, said its action could trigger compensation claims worth billions of dollars. Under the law, cigarettes, pipe tobacco and cigars have to be sold in olive green packs free from branding, but carrying graphic health warnings, from December 2012. Tobacco export countries including Nicaragua, Dominican Republic and Ukraine have warned they may also challenge the laws under global trade rules. Imperial Tobacco said it would test the validity of the laws using its well-known Peter Stuyvesant brand, which has been trade marked in Australia since 1958.",12062011,http://www.reuters.com/article/australia-smoking/update-1-imperial-tobacco-challenges-australia-plain-packaging-laws-idUSL3E7N60MK20111206
21,PM,Philip Morris to fight Australia plain packaging laws,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Philip Morris on Tuesday became the third tobacco giant to file a legal challenge against new Australian laws that will force tobacco products to be sold in dull, plain packaging from late next year. The tough, world-first legislation cleared by parliament is being closely watched by governments considering similar moves in Europe, Canada and New Zealand. It has angered tobacco companies worried it may set a global precedent and infringe on trademark rights. Under the laws, cigarettes, pipe tobacco and cigars have to be sold in olive green packs free from branding, but carrying graphic health warnings, from December next year. Philip Morris, with a 37 percent market share in Australia for its brands including Marlboro and Alpine, said the government had passed a law that acquired its “valuable brands and intellectual property” without offering compensation. “We believe plain packaging violates the Australian Constitution because the Government is seeking to acquire our property without paying compensation,” company spokesman Chris Argent said in a statement. Argent said Philip Morris Asia was seeking a ruling from the Australian High Court, the country’s supreme judicial body, that the government could not prevent the firm from using branding on its cigarette packaging. Based in Melbourne, Philip Morris’s Australian manufacturing arm employs 800 people. In recent weeks, British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco launched separate High Court challenges. Philip Morris said last month it was seeking arbitration over the new laws, through its office in Hong Kong. “Big tobacco just can’t give up their addiction to legal action,” said Attorney General Nicola Roxon. “They have fought governments tooth and nail around the world for decades to stop tobacco control. “Big tobacco is fighting against the government for one very simple reason — because it knows...that plain packaging will work.

23,PM,"GLOBAL ECONOMY-U.S. job market surges in January, Europe perks up","* Euro zone companies return to weak growth in January * Chinese service sector growth sags * British services PMI hits 10-month peak * U.S. data expected to show continued progress By Andy Bruce LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. economy created more jobs in January than even the most optimistic forecast, adding to a sense the global economy started the year in better shape than hoped, especially with new signs of life in Europe. U.S. non-farm payrolls jumped 243,000, far exceeding economists’ expectations for a gain of 150,000 and topping out every forecast from more than 70 analysts polled by Reuters. The jobless rate fell to 8.3 percent from 8.5 percent. The report sent stock index futures and the dollar surging and triggered a sell-off in Treasuries. It followed earlier reports suggesting Europe’s economy may have perked up. “January’s (U.S.) payrolls report is unambiguously positive,” said Rob Carnell, chief international economist at ING Group. “With the labour market playing such a pivotal role in the Fed’s monetary policy strategy, the commitment of the Federal Reserve to keeping rates on hold until at least late 2014 is looking hard to take too seriously.” And there were plenty of bright spots from Friday’s series of purchasing managers indexes (PMIs), which measure changes in the activities of companies all over the world. Britain’s service sector expanded at its fastest pace in 10 months in January, exceeding every expectation, while activity in Indian and Russian services companies grew at the fastest pace in six months. The euro zone’s vast services economy snapped four months of decline by expanding last month, albeit very weakly. The PMIs suggested a recession there, widely expected by economists, will be mild. “All in all, the improvement in the services PMI index is seen as a sign that the (euro zone) economy is not as depressed as some have feared,” said Annalisa Piazza, economist at New Edge Strategy. Further PMI data for the U.S. non-manufacturing sector, due at 1500 GMT, should support recent steady progress of the world’s No.1 economy, according to analysts polled by Reuters. Business and consumer sentiment surveys from the euro zone since the start of the year have shown a definite upturn in optimism, although hard data still point to profound economic weakness in the common currency area. Retail sales during December, including the busy shopping period after Christmas, fell some 1.6 percent compared with a year earlier, suggesting some of the optimism may be of the frothy kind. Economists also warn that developments in the euro zone debt crisis are still critical to the bloc’s economic outlook. Greece at least looks likely to avoid a ruinous sovereign debt default by agreeing a debt swap deal and a new bailout with the International Monetary Fund, although market focus is shifting back to Portugal and its long-term solvency. News from China earlier on Friday qualified slightly any optimism that the global economy started this year with a strong bounce. China’s official government services PMI dipped to 52.9 in January from 56.0, suggesting sharply slowing growth, although that was still comfortably above the 50 mark that denotes expansion. “The overall strength of economic growth remained relatively weak, which will inevitably weigh on the jobs market if weakness persists for longer,” said Qu Hongbin, chief economist for China at HSBC. Arguably the biggest surprise of the day was from the British services PMI, which rocketed to 56.0 from 53.5 in December, beyond every forecast from 26 economists and the strongest showing since last March. “Given all the concerns about the weakness of activity in Q4, the prospect of a double-dip recession, I think those fears now appear to be dispelled to a large extent,” said Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank. The euro zone PMI too raised slim hopes the euro zone might avoid a fully-fledged recession, which economists have long regarded as an odds-on bet. The euro zone service PMI edged up to 50.4 in January from 48.3, its first showing above the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction since last August. “It is encouraging to not only see signs that the German economy has sprung back into life, but also that the rate of decline in the periphery has started to ease quite substantially,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at PMI survey compiler Markit. India’s services sector grew at its fastest pace in six months during January as new business swelled, while rising employment boosted Russian service companies, sending the PMI there to 56.5 in January from 53.8. “The New Year holidays seem to have recharged the batteries of service providers,” said Alexander Morozov, chief economist for Russia and CIS at HSBC. Data from the United States later on Friday should confirm the world’s biggest economy is also moving in the right direction. And the U.S. non-manufacturing ISM survey, comparable to the PMIs and due at 1500 GMT, should stay steady at 53.0 in January - consistent with moderate service sector growth.",2032012,http://www.reuters.com/article/global-economy/global-economy-u-s-job-market-surges-in-january-europe-perks-up-idUSL5E8D32UP20120203

Shipments to other Philip Morris International  affiliates helped compensate for declines of 8.0 percent and 6.5 percent, respectively, in the company’s Czech and Slovak markets, the company said on Thursday. “Our domestic shipments in the Czech Republic and Slovakia remain under pressure,” chairman and managing director Andras Toevisi said. “This is due to lower total cigarette market volumes and consumer down-trading to low-price cigarettes in both markets, as well as to lower-taxed fine-cut tobacco in the Czech Republic.”  ($1 = 19.9173 Czech crowns)   (Reporting by Jason Hovet; Editing by Jan Lopatka)",11082012,http://www.reuters.com/article/philipmorris-czech/czech-philip-morris-9-month-revenue-up-on-exports-idUSL5E8M851V20121108

36,PM,RLPC-Philip Morris seeks $2 bln loan,"LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Tobacco company Philip Morris International (PMI) is tapping the loan market for a $2 billion, 364-day revolving credit facility, which will be used for general liquidity purposes, banking sources said on Friday. PMI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Royal Bank of Scotland is leading the deal that launched on Wednesday, the sources said. The loan pays tight pricing of 15 basis points (bps) over LIBOR if drawn and 4 bps if undrawn. The facility also carries a utilisation fee of 10 bps if the company draws down one-third of the facility and 20 bps if the company draws down on more than two-thirds of the facility. The utilisation fee will go on top of the drawn spread. The tight pricing is a reflection of improving loan market conditions for top rated borrowers, which were further boosted by changes made to regulations over the Liquidity Cover Ratio (LCR), the final version of which was published on January 7. The changes see a reduction of the amount of liquid assets that banks will be required to hold against syndicated loans, and are expected to further boost loan market liquidity and see downward pressure on pricing. PMI has two multi-year revolvers that will stay unchanged. The company has a $2.5 billion revolver that expires on March 31 2015, while a $3.5 billion revolver matures on October 25 2016, according to an SEC filing. Those deals pay drawn margins of 50 bps and 20 bps, respectively. PMI is rated A by Standard & Poor’s and A2 by Moody’s.",1182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/philip-morris-loan/rlpc-philip-morris-seeks-2-bln-loan-idUSL6N0ANAU020130118

The company, which was the international business arm of Altria, was spun off in March 2008 as the parent focused more on its domestic U.S. market. Calantzopoulos became the chief operating officer of the new company, while Altria’s then CEO Louis Camilleri took the helm at Philip Morris International.

39,PM,Fitch Assigns Philip Morris International's Unsecured Bond Issue 'A',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, March 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Philip Morris  International's (PMI; 'A'/Stable/'F1') EUR1.25bn seven-year and EUR0.75bn  12-year notes issue a senior unsecured rating of 'A'.  KEY RATING DRIVERS: International Leader  The ratings reflect PMI's position as the leading company in the global tobacco  industry (excluding the US and China), supported by the diversity of its  portfolio of brands and the countries in which it operates. PMI enjoys large  market shares and pricing leadership in many of the world's most profitable and  growing tobacco markets, with superior diversification across continents.  Geographical Diversity Protects Volumes  PMI's presence in developing markets, where populations are growing and the  incidence of smoking remains high, is key to its ability to protect volumes in  an industry characterised by declining consumption in the developed world. Regulatory Pressures Continue  The ratings also factor in increasing regulation of tobacco companies. This  includes the gradual extension, sponsored by the World Health Organization, of  smoking and advertising restrictions, as well as higher excise duty regimes, to  the historically less regulated, developing markets of Eastern Europe, Asia and  Latin America. Australia's legislation imposing plain packages from December  2012 could have adverse effects on pricing power and volumes if it is replicated  on a wider scale across the world. Price Increases Boost Profit PMI has been able to consistently increase its prices in several markets and  deliver positive organic revenue and profit momentum despite some years of  contraction in volumes. Operating profit grew organically by close to 10% a year  on average over 2008-2012.  Financial Policies Aligned With Rating  PMI's cash flow continues to demonstrate considerable stability at USD8bn-9bn  (FCF before dividend payments and excluding working-capital movements) a year.  The extent to which PMI allocates cash flow to shareholders or M&A; is the main  driver of leverage. During 2008-2012 dividends grew by over 10% a year and  annual share buyback disbursements increased from USD5.0bn-USD5.5bn to USD6.5bn  in 2012. Fitch expects these policies to continue, with share buyback spending  fractionally reducing to USD6bn pa for 2013-2014. At the same time, the agency  expects little M&A; activity. Limited Rating Pressure Fitch projects lease and put option (in relation to the 20% owned by a minority  shareholder in Mexican subsidiary Grupo Carso) adjusted debt to EBITDAR should  remain over 2013-2014 at 2012's level of between 1.6x and 1.8x. This is  acceptable for the current 'A' rating. RATING SENSITIVITIES: Positive: Although Fitch does not currently expect management to pursue  financial policies that would be commensurate with an upgrade, future  developments that could lead to positive rating actions include: - Maintaining gross adjusted leverage sustainably below 1.3x-1.4x - Maintaining the current level of profitability and FCF generation in the  absence of shocks derived from far more stringent regulation Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: - Spending on acquisitions or share buybacks, combined with an impaired rate of  growth for revenue and profit that move gross adjusted leverage above 2.0x - A materially adverse judgment by a court after all appeals processes requiring  PMI to pay a large amount of money as compensation following tobacco litigation Contact:  Principal Analyst Ching Mei Chia Director +44 20 3530 1068 Supervisory Analyst  Giulio Lombardi Senior Director +39 02 8790 872 14 Fitch Italia SpA 1, Vicolo Santa Maria alla Porta 20123 Milan Committee Chair Pablo Mazzini Senior Director +44 20 3530 1021 Media Relations: Mark Morley, London, Tel: +44 203 530 1526, Email:  mark.morley@fitchratings.com.

Consolidated net profit fell 3.9 percent in 2012 to 2.44 billion crowns, or 889 crowns per share, the company said in its annual report posted on its website on Tuesday.

51,PM,Fitch Affirms Philip Morris International at 'A'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, August 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Philip Morris  International, Inc's (PMI) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior  unsecured rating at 'A' and Short-term IDR at 'F1'. The Outlook on the Long-term  IDR is Stable.   The affirmation and Stable Outlook reflects PMI's strong operating profile -  which translates into a healthy operating EBITDA margin in excess of 47%, a  stable and large underlying free cash flow (FCF) of on average USD4bn despite  weak trading conditions in the European Union and a few adverse one-offs in Asia  in H113. This is however contrasted by the scope for higher gross leverage as  PMI is issuing more short term debt to fund an offshore cash build-up while  aiming to maintain its current tax rate.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Growing Leverage  The buyout of a 20% stake in Philip Morris Mexico for approximately USD700m  during 2013 will not affect Fitch's leverage calculation as the agency had  already included this in its lease and put option adjusted leverage ratio.  However, PMI's gross funds from operations (FFO) leverage could - over 2013-2015  - move close to the 2.5x-2.7x maximum threshold compatible with the current 'A'  rating as a result of the issuance of short term debt. We believe PMI is seeking  to maintain its current 29% tax rate against a US corporation rate of 35% and,  in the absence of US tax reform, is likely to maintain part of its overseas  profits offshore. Moderate Net Leverage An increase of debt could represent an increase in PMI's financial risk.  However, Fitch takes comfort from the fact that, should PMI decide to apply its  cash to repaying this additional debt, the effects on net leverage of the  associated tax burden would be limited to between 0.1x and 0.2x. By  incorporating these adverse scenarios, Fitch projects that PMI's net lease  adjusted debt to EBITDAR should remain between 1.6x and 1.9x over 2013-2015.  This remains aligned with other stable and highly cash generative 'A' category  issuers.   International Leader  The ratings reflect PMI's position as the leading company in the global tobacco  industry (excluding the US and China), supported by the diversity of its  portfolio of brands and the countries in which it operates. PMI enjoys large  market shares and pricing leadership in many of the world's most profitable and  growing tobacco markets, with superior diversification across continents. The  company also enjoys solid innovation capability. Fitch is confident that PMI  would be able to manage successfully any transition of tobacco consumption  towards e-cigarettes, should these pick up more significantly. The product that  PMI has under development, as well as its market clout should allow it to win  against the small independent players once e-cigarettes are subjected to more  regulation.  Geographical Diversity Protects Volumes  During 2012 and H113, the EU market (30% of PMI's profits) has suffered from a  sharper than historical volume contraction of over 6%, causing a 0.6% and 5.4%  organic contraction, respectively, in PMI's regional profits. Still, PMI's  presence in developing markets, where population is growing and the incidence of  smoking is high, remains key to its ability to protect volumes.  Price Increases Support Profit The weakness of the EU will continue to weigh on consolidated profits but Fitch  believes that PMI should continue to enjoy scope for profit growth because of  the likely reversal of some cost issues that further affected H113 performance.  Therefore, the 0.2% contraction of profits excluding currency suffered in H113  should be seen as a one-off. Fitch believes price increases in the EU and other  regions should continue to offset volume decline and support profit growth,  although likely at a slower pace than the close to 10% a year delivered  on  average over 2008-2012 in organic terms.   Significant Shareholder Distributions Fitch expects dividends and share buyback spending to remain high, with the  latter at USD6bn pa for 2013-2014. While PMI's cash flow continues to  demonstrate considerable stability at USD8bn-USD9bn (FCF before dividend  payments and excluding working-capital movements) a year, the extent to which  PMI allocates cash flow to shareholders or M&A; is the main driver of leverage.  During 2008-2012 dividends grew by over 10% a year and annual share buyback  disbursements increased to USD6.5bn in 2012 from USD5bn-USD5.5bn. Mitigating  these concerns is the fact that there is limited scope for M&A; in the tobacco  industry. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Positive: Although Fitch does not currently expect management to pursue  financial policies that would be commensurate with an upgrade, future  developments that could lead to a positive rating action include: - Maintaining gross lease-adjusted debt/FFO sustainably below 1.8x or gross  lease-adjusted debt/EBITDAR below 1.3x-1.4x  - Maintaining the current level of profitability and FCF generation in the  absence of shocks derived from far more stringent regulation Negative: Future developments that could lead to a negative rating action  include: - Spending on acquisitions or share buybacks, combined with an impaired rate of  growth for revenue and profit leading to gross lease-adjusted debt/EBITDAR above  2.3x-2.5x  or gross lease-adjusted debt/FFO above 2.5x-2.7x - FFO fixed charge coverage below 8x - A materially adverse judgment by a court after all appeals processes requiring  PMI to pay a large amount of money as compensation following tobacco litigation - Pressure on EBITDA margin dropping below 40% Future developments that could result in the Outlook being revised to Negative: - Lack of clarity in the US over the resolution of the high tax being charged on  foreign profits and, at the same time, insufficient action (including reducing  its share repurchases) by PMI to prevent a permanent increase in gross leverage  above levels prescribed for a downgrade.

52,PM,Thailand to appeal after Philip Morris wins tobacco case,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - The Thai government plans to appeal a court victory by tobacco giant Philip Morris to keep larger health warnings off cigarette packets for sale in Thailand. The Central Administrative Court ruled last Friday to temporarily suspend a new health ministry regulation requiring tobacco warning labels to cover 85 percent of the visible pack, up from 55 percent now. “We have discussed with health minister and legal experts, and we will file an appeal to the Supreme Administrative court in the next two weeks,” Nopporn Cheanklin, deputy director of the Health Ministry’s Disease Control Department, told Reuters. The Thai unit of Philip Morris International Inc filed a lawsuit against the Public Health Ministry on June 26 that asked the Administrative Court to abolish the regulation, which would have taken effect on Oct 2. The Thai Tobacco Trade Association, which represents more than 1,400 retailers nationwide, also filed a similar case, saying the ministry’s regulation was “unconstitutional”. The Administrative Court’s suspension will take effect until the court comes up with a final verdict. About 50,700 people die from smoking-related diseases each year in Thailand, according to the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance. It estimates that 13 million of Thailand’s 65 million people are smokers, including 2.2 million minors. Onanong Pratakphiriya, spokeswoman of Philip Morris (Thailand), said in a statement the health ministry failed to consult related parties in the tobacco industry before imposing any new regulation. “We have clarified to the court that the regulation was not in accordance with legal process and was unnecessary because Thailand already has high awareness about the risks of smoking on health,” the statement said. Philip Morris, the distributor of Marlboro and L&M; cigarettes, has a 20 percent share of cigarettes in Thailand.

54,PM,Marlboro maker Philip Morris to enter e-cigarette business,"(Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) plans next year to enter the electronic cigarette business, a $2 billion-plus global market identified by the maker of Marlboro cigarettes as its “greatest growth opportunity”. Speaking to investors in New York, Philip Morris Chief Executive Andre Calantzopoulos said the company would enter the e-cigarette business in the second half of 2014 to tap fast-growing demand for a less harmful alternative to cigarettes. The world’s largest listed tobacco company will launch a new range of products, called “Reduced-Risk”, Calantzopoulos said at a conference. The company, which sells to countries outside the United States, will also spend more on research and development. “2014 will be a key investment year behind our Reduced-Risk products, our greatest growth opportunity in the years to come,” he said. Market consultant Euromonitor estimates the world market for electronic cigarettes was more than $2 billion last year, with the United States accounting for a quarter of that. The market is growing at breakneck speed. Some analysts predict e-smokes could outsell conventional cigarettes within a decade, particularly as Big Tobacco grapples with declining sales due to government regulation and health-aware consumers. Yet e-cigarettes - battery-powered metal tubes that turn nicotine-laced liquid into vapor - are far from universally accepted as a public health tool. Regulators are agonizing over whether to restrict them as “gateway” products to nicotine addiction and tobacco smoking, or embrace them as treatments for would-be quitters. A big issue is the lack of long-term scientific evidence to support the safety and effectiveness of e-cigarettes, prompting critics like the British Medical Association (BMA) to warn of the dangers of their unregulated use. CELEBRITY E-SMOKERS Celebrity endorsements from Courtney Love, Leonardo DiCaprio and others have provided further inducement to the makers of iconic cigarette brands to invest. Imperial Tobacco Group IMT.L, the world’s No. 4 international tobacco company, has announced plans to launch two electronic cigarettes in fiscal 2014. Lorillard LO.N, known for its Newport and Kent cigarette brands, paid $135 million to acquire Blu Ecigs in 2012 and last month acquired Britain-based e-cigarette maker SKYCIG. Other leading tobacco companies, including British American Tobacco (BATS.L) and Camel cigarette maker Reynolds American RAI.N, are also placing their bets on e-smokes. Philip Morris said on Wednesday it estimated the retail sales value of the eight largest e-cigarette markets worldwide at around $2.5 billion, with nearly half outside the United States and China. Philip Morris also raised its full-year earnings forecast to $5.37-$5.42 per share from $5.35-$5.40, citing a reduced impact from unfavorable exchange rates. Analysts on average were expecting Philip Morris to earn $5.39 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

58,PM,"UPDATE 3-Philip Morris, Japan Tobacco seek Russia advantage with $1.5 bln deal","* Firms buy into distributor Megapolis for $750 mln each * To support expansion in world No.2 market by volume * Megapolis may still pursue IPO * Russia cracking down on tobacco consumption By Maria Kiselyova and Martinne Geller MOSCOW/LONDON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc and Japan Tobacco Inc are buying 20 percent stakes in their Russian distributor Megapolis for $750 million each, strengthening their grip on the world’s No.2 cigarette market by volume after China. Russia, where 40 percent of the adult population smoke, is a key battleground for foreign tobacco companies grappling with dwindling sales in many developed markets where government regulation is becoming stricter and smokers fewer. Foreign players - British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris - supply more than 90 percent of the Russian market, worth about $20 billion a year. However, distribution has stayed mostly in Russian hands with Megapolis - majority owned by Igor Kesayev, who also controls the Degtyarev arms factory and food retailer Dixy  - controlling about 70 percent. “This is a milestone deal,” said an analyst who declined to be named. “Tobacco producers have dreamed of breaking this monopoly.” By partly owning Megapolis, Marlboro cigarettes-maker Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco, home of the Winston brand, may be hoping to reduce their distribution costs and raise their profile compared with Imperial Tobacco, whose Davidoff and Gauloises brands are also distributed by Megapolis. Imperial was not immediately available for comment. Philip Morris said it expected the deal to lift its earnings as of the first quarter of 2014, without detailing how. Tougher regulation is lifting cigarette prices in Russia, crimping sales and limiting product availability as President Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin strives to improve public health and stem a population decline that began after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Morningstar analyst Thomas Mullarkey predicted Russian cigarette sales volumes would fall nearly 10 percent next year due to an increase in excise taxes, but said the price of a pack was still cheap. “It’s still an affordable habit, and the excise taxes are still going to be low compared to U.S. and UK standards, even after the increase,” he said. “In the long run, the Russian market has ample opportunity to continue its trend of going from low-level brands to higher-margin and higher-priced brands.” Megapolis said the deal was the first time that the world’s leading cigarette makers had access to local distributors and that the cash inflow did not mean the company would not resurrect plans for a flotation, pulled in 2011. “This deal is for Megapolis a step toward being more open; we are not giving up the idea of holding an IPO,” a spokesman for the Mercury Group, Kesayev’s holding company, said. The deal includes possible additional payments by each stake buyer of up to $100 million based on Megapolis’ performance over the four years following the closing of the transaction, expected this month. Japan Tobacco has a 36 percent share of the Russian market and runs factories in St Petersburg, Moscow, Leningrad Region and Yelets. Philip Morris has 26 percent and has facilities in Krasnodar and near St Petersburg. Megapolis delivered more than 260 billion cigarettes in 2012 to 150,000 outlets and had revenue of around $12 billion.",12042013,http://www.reuters.com/article/russia-megapolis/update-3-philip-morris-japan-tobacco-seek-russia-advantage-with-1-5-bln-deal-idUSL5N0JJ2EH20131204
59,PM,Fitch: Philip Morris International's Acquisition Reduces Rating Headroom,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) MILAN/LONDON, December 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings said that the USD750m cash  acquisition announced today by Philip Morris International Inc (PMI,  A/Stable/F1) of 20% equity interest in Megapolis Distribution BV could push  credit metrics towards the weaker end of the band compatible with the company's  current 'A' rating but should leave the ratings unaffected. The acquisition,  together with other transactions in Mexico and Algeria, will result in a total  USD2.1bn M&A; spending this year on top of its USD6bn disbursements on share  buybacks.  PMI's free cash flow (FCF) has come under pressure from deteriorating trading  conditions and investments in innovation that are absorbing resources on top of  the high dividend payout maintained by the company.  Fitch had expected PMI's lease-adjusted net debt/operating EBITDAR and FFO-  adjusted gross leverage to increase to 1.5x and 2.5x respectively in FY13. These  levels would be comfortably within the respective thresholds of 2.0x and  2.5x-2.7x that Fitch views as acceptable for the current 'A' rating.  However as a result of adverse movements in exchange rates, expected continuing  softness in the EU, Russian and Philippines duty-paid tobacco markets over  2013-2014 and investments in reduced-risk products including e-cigarettes, PMI  is likely to report slightly weaker FCF than previously expected. Consequently,  lease-adjusted net debt/operating EBITDAR leverage is likely to be higher than  expected in 2013 and both metrics could deteriorate further from 2014 onwards.  Nevertheless, among global fast-moving consumer goods companies, PMI remains in  the top tier in terms of profit margin and for strength and stability of FCF  generation.  Furthermore, Fitch points to management's recent public comment about the  company's rising leverage and the reiteration of their commitment to an 'A'  rating.  While management said they would set share buyback spending at the highest end  supported by the 'A' rating, they have also suggested they could reduce it from  mid-2015 (when the current USD18bn buyback programme concludes) to a level equal  to FCF (around USD3bn to 4bn p.a. based on our projections). The speed at which  management will shift to more creditor-friendly policies as well its commitment  to them will be a critical factor to determine whether or not the rating outlook  will remain Stable.

65,PM,'Marlboro Man' who later warned against smoking dies of lung disease,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Eric Lawson, one of several actors who depicted the “Marlboro Man” cowboy in a long-running series of cigarette ads for Philip Morris and later appeared in an anti-tobacco message for the American Cancer Society, has died of lung disease. He was 72, and died at his home in the central California town of San Luis Obispo of respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which the U.S. surgeon general has linked to smoking. His death was reported by his family in an obituary notice published on Sunday in the Los Angeles Times. The date of his death was not specified. The square-jawed Lawson played dozens of bit parts in television shows spanning three decades, starting in the 1970s, including “Baretta,” “The Waltons,” “CHiPs,” “Charlie’s Angeles and “The A-Team.” His screen credits also included appearances in several relatively obscure film titles, such as “Gymkata,” “King Cobra” and “Tall Tale,” but his acting career was disrupted by an accident he suffered while filming the 1991 movie “The Shooter,” according to his obituary. Lawson was perhaps best recognized for his appearances during the late 1970s and early 1980s as the rugged cowboy in Marlboro Man print ads for Marlboro-brand cigarettes, one of the world’s most successful commercial campaigns.

66,PM,'Marlboro Man' who later warned against smoking dies of lung disease,"LOS ANGELES, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Eric Lawson, one of several actors who depicted the “Marlboro Man” cowboy in a long-running series of cigarette ads for Philip Morris and later appeared in an anti-tobacco message for the American Cancer Society, has died of lung disease. He was 72, and died at his home in the central California town of San Luis Obispo of respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which the U.S. surgeon general has linked to smoking. His death was reported by his family in an obituary notice published on Sunday in the Los Angeles Times. The date of his death was not specified. The square-jawed Lawson played dozens of bit parts in television shows spanning three decades, starting in the 1970s, including “Baretta,” “The Waltons,” “CHiPs,” “Charlie’s Angeles and “The A-Team.” His screen credits also included appearances in several relatively obscure film titles, such as “Gymkata,” “King Cobra” and “Tall Tale,” but his acting career was disrupted by an accident he suffered while filming the 1991 movie “The Shooter,” according to his obituary. Lawson was perhaps best recognized for his appearances during the late 1970s and early 1980s as the rugged cowboy in Marlboro Man print ads for Marlboro-brand cigarettes, one of the world’s most successful commercial campaigns.

69,PM,Philip Morris to stop cigarette production in Australia,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - American cigarette and tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) plans to stop manufacturing cigarettes in Australia by the end of the year, citing government production regulations that restrict its export opportunities. Philip Morris said it would shift manufacturing from Victoria state to South Korea, where it would not be bound by so-called “reduced-fire risk” laws which mean it must use particular paper and construction methods. “With any significant export opportunity restricted by Australian government regulations, our Moorabbin factory is significantly under-utilized, operating at less than half of its currently installed capacity,” John Gledhill, managing director for Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islands, said in a statement. The company had invested heavily in the factory from 2006 to 2009 to capitalize on increased demand in Asia. But it said the introduction of the government’s reduced-fire risk requirements in 2010, which are designed to ensure a cigarette self-extinguishes when dropped on the ground, led to taste changes that did not match consumer preferences in Asia. About 180 jobs will be cut at Moorabbin, which was the first Philip Morris affiliate established outside the United States 60 years ago. The company will continue to employ around 550 people in Australia in sales, finance and retail. Gledhill said Philip Morris’ sales and production volumes were stable in 2013, despite the introduction of Australia’s plain packaging laws in December 2012. Those laws, the most stringent in the world, require standardized packaging on all tobacco products, forcing companies to replace logos and branding with graphic images of smoking-related diseases on a drab background. Clayton Ford, a spokesman for Philip Morris, said the factory closure was in no way related to the plain packaging laws.

72,PM,"Australians' urge to shop, build and buy homes a boon for jobs","SYDNEY (Reuters) - Job losses in manufacturing have dominated Australian headlines — 350 at BP (BP.L), 180 at Philip Morris (PM.N), 300 at Boeing (BA.N) in the past month alone — but data proven to herald increased hiring tell a much cheerier tale. In a country obsessed with real estate, a housing boom has given people confidence to spend more freely — and that may be enough to keep a lid on unemployment in the year ahead. “Overall, our range of forward-looking indicators of economy-wide jobs growth unanimously point to improved hiring intentions and a turning point in the labor market,” said Scott Haslem, chief economist at UBS. Hopes are fixed in particular on retail and construction, where a revival in consumer spending, an invasion of foreign retailers and a surge in home building all bode well for a sizable pick-up in employment. If past patterns on measures such as job advertisements, vacancies and a range of business surveys hold true, Haslem estimates that retail, hospitality and wholesale combined with construction could generate around 140,000 jobs in the coming year. That would not be far from the 170,000 needed to stabilize the unemployment rate near its current level of 6 percent. “Our clients are always asking ‘where will the jobs come from?’” said Haslem. “But our analysis shows it is much less difficult to answer the question than is widely believed.” The reasons for uncertainty seem clear. Unemployment has risen to 6.0 percent, the highest since mid-2003. The central bank expects the labor market to stay soft and the unemployment rate to rise further. In February, Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) became the last of the global automakers to say it planned to cease production in Australia, triggering angst about the future of manufacturing. But the situation for manufacturers is not as bad as the headlines suggest. Over the six months to February, for example, manufacturing actually added 38,200 jobs. And after a long fallow period, retailers have enjoyed a marked acceleration in spending in recent months. The annual growth rate in sales quadrupled from a Scrooge-like 1.2 percent in mid-2013 to a far more store-friendly 4.9 percent in February. That is good news for the labor market as the A$270 billion ($250 billion) retail sector is the second-biggest employer behind health, with 10 percent of all jobs. Add in the wholesale and hospitality sectors, and the job share rises to 20 percent. Australia’s two biggest supermarket chains certainly seem optimistic. Coles, owned by Wesfarmers (WES.AX), plans to invest A$1.1 billion over the next three years building 70 stores and creating more than 16,000 jobs. Rival Woolworths (WOW.AX) will open 108 new stores in its 2014 fiscal year alone, generating around 7,000 jobs. The pipeline of construction work is already swelling, with the value of building approvals across the retail and wholesale sectors up 24 percent in February from a year earlier. And it is not just local retailers. Australia is suddenly attracting a flood of new entrants, encouraged by its strong currency and rapid population growth. Zara (ITX.MC), Gap (GPS.N), H&M; (HMb.ST) and Topshop are among the big-name foreign retailers to have set up shop, while Japanese casual-wear group Uniqlo (9983.T) opens its first store in Australia this month, as does U.S. chain Brooks Brothers. The revival in spending owes much to a red-hot housing market. Historically low mortgage rates have unleashed pent-up demand and lifted home prices in the major cities by over 10 percent in the past year. Property consultant RP Data estimates there were almost a quarter of a million properties advertised for sale over March, yet demand stayed ahead of supply. “Although new listings are way up on a year ago, the rate of sale is much faster,” says RP Data research director Tim Lawless. “To put it simply, properties are being absorbed by the market faster than they are being listed for sale.” The Housing Industry Association (HIA) estimates sales of new homes jumped 4.6 percent in February to their highest in almost three years. All these homes have to be kitted out, boosting demand for everything from furniture, to appliances to garden equipment. Sales of household goods surged 3.8 percent in the first two months of the year. Sales of hardware, building and garden supplies grew an annual 10.7 percent, the fastest in a decade. There is much more to come as approvals to build new homes were up by almost a quarter in February from a year earlier and not far from all-time highs at an annualized rate of 200,000. The value of approvals for building new office space is also running hot with annual growth up at 46 percent. The bulging pipeline of work should help fill the hole left as major mining projects start winding down or are completed. “Importantly, there has been strength in job advertising in some key industries, including construction,” says Ivan Colhoun, head of Australian economics at ANZ. The bank compiles a monthly tally of job advertisements on the Internet and in major newspapers. It found ads climbed to 132,925 in March, the highest in almost a year. “There is now clearer evidence that labor demand is strengthening,” said Colhoun. “This suggests that conditions in the labor market are beginning to improve, despite recent job-loss announcements in a number of companies.

74,PM,UPDATE 1-S.Korea's state health insurer tobacco firms for damages,"(Adds analyst comment, background) SEOUL, April 14 (Reuters) - South Korea’s state health insurer is seeking an initial 53.7 billion won ($51.9 million) from three tobacco companies, including the local units of Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco , to offset treatment costs for diseases linked to smoking. The National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) said on Monday it was suing the two global cigarette makers, as well as local market leader KT&G; Corp, in a South Korean court. The lawsuit is the first by a state organisation against tobacco firms among 37 countries and territories in the Western Pacific, according to the World Health Organization. Only four tobacco lawsuits have ever been heard in South Korea, all by individuals or families, so there is no precedent of a successful action against a tobacco company. Even if the insurer prevails, Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham said the damages being sought are so small the companies should be able to easily cover it through their cash flow. “The broader issue is, do other governments try to do the same thing, and I don’t see why not. It’s a legitimate thing to go after to solve a legitimate problem,” Gorham said. “We believe the NHIS, as it takes responsibility for the health of the public and oversees the insurance budget, has a natural duty to bring this tobacco lawsuit,” NHIS lawyer An Sun-young told reporters. The damages were calculated based on data on payments by state insurers for patients with three cancer types associated with smoking, NHIS added. The insurer has previously said it spends more than $1.6 billion each year on treating smoking-linked diseases. BAT said it would be inappropriate to comment given that the case is ongoing. KT&G; said it would base its response to the lawsuit on previous legal processes. Philip Morris did not respond to requests for comment. Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, earlier this month said it would shut a cigarette factory in Australia and shift production to South Korea. Philip Morris and BAT combined account for about a third of  South Korea’s $9.3 billion tobacco market, which is the 10th largest in the world, according to Morningstar. KT&G; accounts for the remaining just over 60 percent while Japan Tobacco International (JTI), an affiliate of Japan Tobacco Inc, has the smallest market share at 6.4 percent. JTI was not named in the lawsuit. The NHIS lawsuit comes after South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled last week in favour of KT&G; on a separate case brought by individuals, which found no causal link between lung cancer and smoking.

Philip Morris and its rivals like Imperial Tobacco Group  and British American Tobacco are grappling with declining sales in a number of markets due to increasing government regulation and more health-aware consumers, as well as smuggling and an economic downturn. The maker of Marlboro cigarettes said it now expects to earn $4.87-$4.97 per share for 2014, lower than the $5.09-$5.19 per share it expected earlier and $5.26 it earned in 2013. “We continue to face significant currency headwinds, an improving but weak macro-economic environment in the European Union and known challenges in Asia,” Chief Executive Andre Calantzopoulos said in a statement. However, Philip Morris expects adjusted profit in 2014 to rise 6 to 8 percent from the $5.40 it reported last year. The company forecast a 2 to 3 percent fall in 2014 total cigarette industry volume, excluding China and United States. Philip Morris also said it acquired Nicocigs Ltd, a U.K.-based e-cigarette maker to get access to the growing e-cigarette category in the U.K. market. Financial terms were not disclosed, but the company said the deal is not material to its 2014 results or cash flow. The company, which plans to launch a proprietary e-cigarette in 2016, said its reduced-risk products are expected to add to its bottom line within next three to four years. Philip Morris said last year it would enter the e-cigarette business in the second half of 2014 to tap fast-growing demand for a less harmful alternative to cigarettes. The company teamed up with Altria Group in 2013 to market electronic cigarettes and other “reduced risk” tobacco products. Less dangerous alternatives to cigarettes are a key focus for big tobacco firms as governments worldwide crack down and consumers cut back consumption. Philip Morris shares closed at $88.89 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

81,PM,Philip Morris seeks review of EU tobacco law,"LONDON, June 27 (Reuters) - Marlboro cigarette maker Philip Morris International is seeking to challenge Europe’s new laws on tobacco products, the latest clash between Big Tobacco and governments seeking tighter regulation. Philip Morris, the world’s biggest international cigarette company, said it filed papers on Friday in an English court seeking a review of the EU’s Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The directive, which entered into force last month, requires measures including pictorial and text health warnings across 65 percent of tobacco packages, deeper track and trace capabilities to fight the illicit trade in cigarettes and a ban on menthol cigarettes after a four-year phase-out period. Philip Morris is asking the court to review whether the directive complies with EU treaties in three areas. The first is whether the ban on menthol disrupts the internal market, the second is whether an apparent ban on “truthful and non-misleading claims” on packages hurts consumers’ rights to information, and the third is whether the delegation of powers to the European Commission complies with EU treaties. The review process is expected to take as much as two to three years, Philip Morris said.

83,PM,Tobacco-derived 'plantibodies' enter the fight against Ebola,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers’ use of the tobacco plant as a fast and cheap way to produce novel biotechnology treatments is gaining global attention because of its role in an experimental Ebola therapy. The treatment, which had been tested only in lab animals before being given to two American medical workers in Liberia, consists of proteins called monoclonal antibodies that bind to and inactivate the Ebola virus. For decades biotech companies have produced such antibodies by growing genetically engineered mouse cells in enormous metal bioreactors. But in the case of the new Ebola treatment ZMapp, developed by Mapp Pharmaceuticals, the antibodies were produced in tobacco plants at Kentucky Bioprocessing, a unit of tobacco giant Reynolds American.  The tobacco-plant-produced monoclonals have been dubbed “plantibodies.” “Tobacco makes for a good vehicle to express the antibodies because it is inexpensive and it can produce a lot,” said Erica Ollmann Saphire, a professor at The Scripps Research Institute and a prominent researcher in viral hemorrhagic fever diseases like Ebola. “It is grown in a greenhouse and you can manufacture kilograms of the materials. It is much less expensive than cell culture.” In the standard method of genetic engineering, DNA is slipped into bacteria, and the microbes produce a protein that can be used to combat a disease. A competing approach called molecular “pharming” uses a plant instead of bacteria. In the case of the Ebola treatment, Mapp uses the common tobacco plant, Nicotiana benthanmianas. The process is very similar. A gene is inserted into a virus that is then used to infect the tobacco plant. The virus acts like a micro-Trojan Horse, ferrying the engineered DNA into the plant. Cells infected with the virus and the gene it is carrying produce the target protein. The tobacco leaves are then harvested and processed to extract the protein, which is  purified. ZMapp’s protein is a monoclonal antibody, which resembles ordinary disease-fighting antibodies but has a highly specific affinity for particular cells, including viruses such as Ebola. It attaches itself to the virus cells and inactivates them. The drug so far has only been produced in very small quantities, but interest in it is stoking debate over whether it should be made more widely available to the hundreds of people stricken with Ebola in Africa while it remains untested. “We want to have a huge impact on the Ebola outbreak,” Mapp CEO Kevin Whaley said in an interview at company headquarters in San Diego. “We would love to play a bigger role.” Whaley said he was not aware of any significant safety issues with the serum. He would not discuss whether the company has been contacted about providing the drug overseas.  But he did note the novel manufacturing process carries its own risk, and would have to be cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as part of the approval process. The FDA would, for example, have to be satisfied that the plant extraction process had not led to contamination of the resulting drug.  The tobacco plant grows quickly, said Reynolds spokesman David Howard, and “it takes only about a week (after the genes are introduced) before you can begin extracting the protein.” He declined to say how much medication each plant can yield or whether Kentucky Bioprocessing is in a position to produce ZMapp in significant quantities. Scripps’ Saphire said it can still take anywhere from one to three months to produce the ZMapp serum for wider use given the complexities of the process.  In 2007, Kentucky Bioprocessing entered into an agreement with Mapp Biopharmaceutical and the Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University to refine the tobacco-plant approach. The approach attracted funding support from the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).  For all the hope, however, the plant technique has delivered few commercial products. In 2012 the FDA okayed a drug for the rare genetic disorder Gaucher disease from Israel’s Protalix BioTherapeutics and Pfizer. Called Elelyso, it is made in carrot cells, and is the only such drug to reach the market. Other companies have fallen far short, though it is not clear if the technique was to blame. Calgary-based SemBioSys Genetics Inc, which used safflowers to produce an experimental diabetes drug, folded in 2012 before it finished clinical trials. Even Kentucky Bioprocessing, which at one point was developing monoclonal antibodies against HIV (the virus that causes AIDS), C. difficile bacterial infection, and the human papillomavirus, has dropped the last two projects, Howard said. Last year Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp acquired a majority share of Quebec City-based Medicago, which is developing influenza and other vaccines using the tobacco-plant technology. The other 40 percent is owned by tobacco giant Philip Morris International.

86,PM,Philip Morris ordered to defend fraud suit over U.S. military vendors,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday revived a lawsuit against Philip Morris USA Inc that claims the tobacco company defrauded the federal government by failing to sell cigarettes to military vendors at the lowest price. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that a lower court judge should not have dismissed the lawsuit by Anthony Oliver, the president and CEO of Medallion Brands International Co, another cigarette company. The 2008 lawsuit against Philip Morris, an Altria Group Inc company, concerns cigarette sales to the Navy Exchange Service Command and the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, both of which operate facilities that sell products to military personnel and their families. Oliver said Philip Morris sold cigarettes to its affiliates at lower rates than those the government paid. The lawsuit claimed Philip Morris charged millions of dollars more each year than it should have. Philip Morris said in court papers that Oliver is simply a competitor who also sells cigarettes to the military and has “no inside information” about the claims. In Tuesday’s ruling, the appeals court said the lawsuit could proceed because the information on which it was based was not, as the lower court found, already publicly disclosed. The False Claims Act allows citizens, as well as the government, to bring claims. If they win, they receive a percentage of the damages.

90,PM,Marlboro HeatSticks on sale in Milan this week,"LONDON (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc, the world’s largest tobacco company, plans to launch its new iQOS smokeless device and Marlboro HeatSticks in Milan, Italy on Thursday following a better-than-expected launch in Nagoya, Japan earlier this month. With a battery-operated system that heats, without burning, small tubes of tobacco called Marlboro HeatSticks, the iQOS is a hybrid between conventional cigarettes and next-generation e-cigarettes. Such devices, including one sold by Japan Tobacco,  are meant to be less harmful than traditional cigarettes but more satisfying for smokers than e-cigarettes, which vaporize nicotine-laced liquid.  The burgeoning market for electronic cigarettes is a key battleground for Big Tobacco players such as Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco. Cigarette sales are falling as people around the world quit the habit or cut back on their financial spending. Speaking at a conference on Wednesday hosted by Morgan Stanley, Philip Morris Chief Executive Andre Calantzopoulos called the launch “a landmark moment” that opened a “groundbreaking new chapter in the history of our company”. “Whilst it is early days our results already surpass our expectations,” Calantzopoulos said of the Nov. 4 launch in Japan, where the kit has a recommended price of 6,980 yen ($59.31) and the plug-in HeatSticks, which resemble mini cigarettes, cost 460 yen ($3.91) for a pack of 20, in line with traditional Marlboros. In Europe, where taxes are higher, the recommended price of the kit is 70 euros ($87.87) while a pack of sticks is 5 euros ($6.28). Italy has classified HeatSticks for excise tax purposes at a rate similar to cigarettes, but Calantzopoulos hopes a law change will reduce the rate. The company is touting product benefits including no fire, no ash and less smell, but is making no health claims.  Launches outside Italy and Japan are not expected until 2016, due to short-term constraints on manufacturing capacity. Philip Morris sold 880.2 billion cigarettes last year, a decline of 5 percent. It says it could sell 30 to 50 billion more sticks if its “reduced risk” products were adopted by three to five percent of smokers in the markets it plans to enter in the next five years.

Reynolds Tobacco Co, Lorillard Inc and Altria Group’s Philip Morris USA - will pay $100 million to settle hundreds of federal lawsuits over smoking, according to an announcement from plaintiffs’ lawyers on Wednesday. The agreement will cover more than 400 lawsuits filed in federal court in Florida by smokers or their families, according to court filings. The settlement will not cover cases that have already gone to trial, or thousands of lawsuits in state court. The tentative agreement will be finalized if all individual plaintiffs participate, or the parties otherwise agree. Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds will each pay $42.5 million, and Lorillard will pay $15 million, according to a lead lawyer for plaintiffs, Joe Rice of law firm Motley Rice. Rice and other plaintiffs’ firms that negotiated the deal said Wednesday they were pleased their clients would be compensated after years of litigation. It is the first major agreement reached by the three companies to resolve a chunk of so-called Engle cases, named after a class action brought by Florida residents over injuries or deaths they said were caused by tobacco-related medical conditions. In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court overturned a $145 billion award for the class and ruled that plaintiffs had too many individual issues to proceed as a group. However, the court said plaintiffs could bring individual lawsuits based on findings from earlier in the litigation that nicotine is addictive and that tobacco use can cause diseases. After that ruling, thousands of cases were filed in Florida federal and state courts. All three companies have been hit with millions of dollars in damages from dozens of Engle cases that have gone to trial. In 2013, Liggett Group and parent company Vector Group Ltd  paid $110 million to nearly 5,000 smoking lawsuits. Murray Garnick, associate general counsel for Altria Client Services, said the agreement was in the company’s best interests and that it will vigorously defend unsettled lawsuits. R.J. Reynolds Assistant General Counsel Jeff Raborn said the agreement presented an opportunity for the company, an indirect subsidiary of Reynolds American Inc, to put the federal litigation behind it. Lorillard general counsel Ronald Milstein said the company was pleased to have resolved the federal cases on favorable terms. Shares of Lorillard were up 0.2 percent in morning trading, while Reynolds American and Altria each gained 0.3 percent.

100,PM,Marlboro-maker Philip Morris raises profit view on strong Europe demand,"April 16 (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc’s  shares are on track for their best day in over six years after the maker of Marlboro cigarettes raised its full-year profit forecast as it sold more cigarettes at higher prices, especially in Europe. Philip Morris’s shares rose as much as 8.3 percent on Thursday, their biggest intraday percentage gain since November 2008, after the company’s revenue and profit fell less than expected in the first quarter. Like all tobacco companies, Philip Morris is grappling with  falling sales as people cut back on smoking due to higher taxes and growing health consciousness, forcing them to join forces or boost their e-cigarette business. Philip Morris, which also makes L&M;, Chesterfield and Parliament cigarettes, bought UK’s Nicocigs for an undisclosed price last year to build its presence in the fast-growing e-cig market. Still, shipment volumes of Marlboro, Philip Morris’s biggest and most popular brand, rose 2.1 percent in the first quarter ended March 31, outpacing the 1.4 percent growth in total shipment volume. Most of the rise was driven by higher demand in Italy, Spain, parts of Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, helping the company increased its market share in these regions. “Our organic volume and market share performance was better than we originally forecast,” Chief Executive Andre Calantzopoulos said in a statement. That helped Philip Morris raise its full-year profit forecast to $4.32-$4.42 per share from $4.27-$4.37 per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $4.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Profit attributable to the company fell 4.3 percent to $1.80 billion, or $1.16 per share, in the first quarter, while revenue, excluding excise taxes, declined 4.3 percent to $6.62 billion. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.01 per share and revenue of $6.13 billion. The company’s shares were up 7.9 percent at $84.35 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

103,PM,"Philip Morris to cut stake in Indonesian unit, could raise over $1 billion","JAKARTA/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. cigarette giant Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) plans to sell a stake worth at least $1 billion in Indonesian unit PT HM Sampoerna Tbk (HMSP.JK) to comply with free-float rules, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Philip Morris currently owns 98.18 percent of Sampoerna,  Indonesia’s biggest cigarette maker by market value and which is worth $23 billion. Philip Morris has short-listed Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse AG, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Mandiri Sekuritas to sell down its holding by at least 5.68 percent, to make the publicly available shares in Sampoerna equivalent to at least 7.5 percent of its total share base, one of the sources said. Both people declined to be named due to the confidentiality of the matter. The stock exchange requires all listed Indonesian firms to have a free float of at least 7.5 percent by Jan. 30, 2016. It was not clear when Philip Morris planned to sell its stake, the sources added.     Sampoerna shares rose 0.8 percent on Monday, outperforming the broader Jakarta stock exchange .JKSE, which was down 1.2 percent. The company has previously said it was exploring ways to comply with the new free-float requirement. Citigroup declined comment, while Goldman, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan did not give an immediate comment. Mandiri Sekuritas was not immediately available to comment. Sampoerna sells some of the most popular cigarette brands in Indonesia, a country where smoking remains widespread. It said it had a market share of nearly 35 percent last year.

106,PM,Fitch Revises Philip Morris's Outlook to Negative; Affirms at 'A',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON/MILAN, July 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has revised the US-based tobacco  group Philip Morris International, Inc's (PMI) Outlook to Negative from Stable  and affirmed the Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. The Short-term  IDR has been affirmed at 'F1'. The revision in Outlook reflects PMI's stretched credit metrics, after profit  margins and cash flow were compressed in 2014 by specific market challenges in  Asia, foreign currency effects as well as investments in reduced-risk products  (RRPs). Past shareholder returns have also contributed to exacerbating the  deterioration of credit metrics.  However, if PMI prioritises debt reduction from improving free cash flow (FCF),  leading to (FFO) adjusted gross leverage to fall below 3.0x or net leverage  below 2.5x by 2016, then the Outlook may be revised back to Stable. Fitch  assumes that there will be no share buybacks during 2015-2018. KEY RATING DRIVERS Profit Margin Compression PMI remains one of the most profitable tobacco companies with its EBITDA margin  of 44.1%, higher than British American Tobacco's 41.3% (A-/Negative) and  Imperial Tobacco Group PLC's 43.1% (BBB/Negative). Yet, in 2014 EBITDA margin  suffered from specific market challenges in Asia (Indonesia, the Philippines and  Australia), transactional FX headwinds and investments in RRPs. While Indonesia,  the Philippines, Australia and the European Union should perform better in 2015,  there is a risk of EBITDA margins contracting further in 2015 as a result of  continuing currency headwinds, an important excise tax increase in South Korea  and ongoing challenges in Japan.  Lower FCF After a period of stability at around USD10bn, PMI's FFO dropped to USD8.4bn in  2014 due to margin reduction and the strengthening of USD against the currencies  of the markets in which the company sells its products. As a result also of  increasing dividend distributions, FCF contracted materially to USD551m (1.9% of  sales) from an average USD3bn over 2012-2013. This adverse effect on leverage,  however, is partly mitigated by almost half of the company's debt (40%) being  denominated in EUR at end-2014.  Leverage Beyond Rating Guidance  FFO net leverage rose to 3.2x in 2014 from 2.6x in 2013 and Fitch projects  leverage to peak around 3.3x-3.5x in 2015 before falling to approximately 3.0x  in 2016, a level still above the 2.5x threshold compatible for the 'A' rating.  Undistributed Foreign Earnings (UFE) PMI faces a mismatch between the location of its earnings and debt, given that  the company does not have any sales in the US while debt is raised at the  holding level (domiciled in the US). While PMI intends to repatriate its foreign  earnings, it is unlikely to be immediate, and could be costly under the current  US tax regime. Our net debt figure now includes a generic 35% tax haircut on cash, which is  based on our conservative assumption that, if repatriated back to the US, these  cash balances would be subject to the maximum US tax rate.   Significant Shareholder Distributions  The deterioration in credit metrics has been exacerbated by large shareholder  distribution up until 2014. Through dividends (high pay-out ratio of 70%) and  its share buyback programmes, PMI has historically distributed to shareholders  more than the FCF it generated. A large part of those share buybacks has  historically been debt-funded, which resulted in an increase in debt quantum  over time.  Fitch views positively the company's announced suspension of share buybacks in  2015, indicating PMI's willingness to protect its credit metrics. However, the  extent to which PMI allocates cash flow to shareholders is one of the main  drivers of leverage, which is currently outside the range compatible with its  'A' rating. Fitch estimates that the dividend pay-out ratio in 2015 will be in  excess of 90%. This is above historical rates and PMI's long-term dividend  pay-out target of 65%.  RRPs Weigh on Profits Fitch is confident that PMI would be able to manage successfully a transition of  tobacco consumption towards e-cigarettes or other RRPs, should the consumption  shift from traditional cigarettes accelerate. The agency believes that, combined  with PMI's market clout, the products that the company has available and under  development, should allow it to win against small independent e-cigarette  players. However, investments in RRPs in 2014 have further impacted operating  profit, adding to the adverse impact from currency movements, a trend that Fitch  expects to continue in 2015.  Scope for Performance Recovery We expect PMI's organic growth to recover over time, driven by better overall  pricing/product mix as well as volume recovery in Asia. In 1Q15, the company  reported good pricing gain of 7.7% and positive volume growth of 1.4%, resulting  in high net revenues organic growth of 9.1%. This followed organic growth of 2%  in 2014, as prices rose 4.8% largely offsetting a volume drop of 2.8%.  Leading Industry Player PMI's ratings continue to reflect the company's leading position in the global  tobacco industry (excluding the US and China), supported by the diversity of its  portfolio of brands and the countries in which it operates. It enjoys large  market shares and pricing leadership in many of the most profitable and growing  tobacco markets, with superior diversification across continents. KEY ASSUMPTIONS - Revenue and profits impacted by currency headwinds as well as investments in  RRPs in 2015 - Low single-digit sales growth and slight increase in profitability from 2016  onwards with price gains offsetting volume declines - FCF margin below 1% in 2015 and resuming around 4% from 2016 onwards - Dividends increasing 2%-3% annually, resulting in a dividend pay-out ratio of  around 80%-90% between 2015 and 2018 - No share buybacks between 2015 and 2018 RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that could lead to a negative rating action  include: - Persistently weaker than historical performance with low or negative organic  growth and operating EBITDA margin failing to return above 45% in 2015 and 2016  (2014: 44.1%) -  Neutral to negative FCF in 2015 and failing to return to at least 3.5% - 4%  of revenues by 2016 (2014: 1.9%) - Inability to reduce debt or increase FFO causing FFO-adjusted gross leverage  to remain above 3.0x (2014: 3.3x) and FFO-adjusted net leverage above 2.5x  (2014: 3.2x) -  FFO fixed charge coverage below 6x (2014: 7.0x) -  Unfavourable tobacco litigation outcome requiring PMI to pay a large  compensation Positive: Fitch does not currently expect management to pursue financial  policies that would be commensurate with an upgrade. Future developments that  could lead to a revision of the Outlook to Stable include: - Evidence that the allocation of improving FCF prioritises debt reduction and  enables FFO adjusted gross leverage to drop below 3.0x or FFO adjusted net  leverage below 2.5x by 2016 -  FCF margin on track to recover to a level sustainably above 5% -  FFO fixed charge coverage sustainably above 6x -  No material cash outflow from ongoing litigation  LIQUIDITY  At year-end 2014, PMI's gross debt of USD28.5bn was well spread out with no more  than USD3bn of bonds maturing in a given year. Fitch views liquidity backstop  resources of up to USD8bn as comfortable considering the projected amount of  commercial paper issuance.

107,PM,Philip Morris expands e-cigarette deal with Altria,"LONDON (Reuters) - Philip Morris International (PM.N) and its American counterpart Altria Group (MO.N) announced on Thursday an expansion of their agreement on e-cigarettes to include research and development, as the market for tobacco alternatives continues to evolve.  The companies, which split from each other in 2008, said in 2013 that Philip Morris would have the exclusive right to sell Altria’s e-cigarettes outside the United States, and Altria the exclusive right to sell two of Philip Morris’s “heated tobacco products” in the United States. They also said they would cooperate on scientific assessments of the products, engaging with regulators and sharing improvements in the products. On Thursday, the companies said they were expanding that framework to include a joint research, development and technology-sharing agreement, which a Philip Morris spokeswoman said would set a framework to develop the next generation of e-cigarettes.  E-cigarettes, which heat nicotine-laced liquid into an inhalable vapor, have been growing in popularity on both sides of the Atlantic, but remain the subject of much debate due largely to a lack of long-term data about their effects on health. Still, many scientists believe they are much safer than traditional cigarettes.

108,PM,Philip Morris expands e-cigarette deal with Altria,"LONDON, July 16 (Reuters) - Philip Morris International  and its American counterpart Altria Group  announced on Thursday an expansion of their agreement on e-cigarettes to include research and development, as the market for tobacco alternatives continues to evolve. The companies, which split from each other in 2008, said in 2013 that Philip Morris would have the exclusive right to sell Altria’s e-cigarettes outside the United States, and Altria the exclusive right to sell two of Philip Morris’s “heated tobacco products” in the United States. They also said they would cooperate on scientific assessments of the products, engaging with regulators and sharing improvements in the products. On Thursday, the companies said they were expanding that framework to include a joint research, development and technology-sharing agreement, which a Philip Morris spokeswoman said would set a framework to develop the next generation of e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes, which heat nicotine-laced liquid into an inhalable vapor, have been growing in popularity on both sides of the Atlantic, but remain the subject of much debate due largely to a lack of long-term data about their effects on health. Still, many scientists believe they are much safer than traditional cigarettes.

110,PM,UPDATE 1-Indonesia's Sampoerna plans $1.94 bln rights issue to meet free-float rule,"* Sampoerna selling shares at 63,000-99,000 rupiah each * Sale will be biggest in Indonesia in 7 years * Philip Morris had aimed to raise at least $1 bln by cutting stake   (Adds milestones and background) By Eveline Danubrata JAKARTA, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Philip Morris-owned Indonesia cigarette maker Sampoerna is planning a rights issue that will raise nearly $2 billion to meet stock exchange free-float rules, in what will be the Southeast Asian nation’s biggest share sale in seven years. Indonesia’s biggest listed cigarette maker is selling as many as 269.7 million shares in a range of 63,000-99,000 rupiah each for a total of as much as 26.7 trillion rupiah ($1.94 billion), the company said in a stock exchange filing late on Wednesday. Sources previously said that Philip Morris International Inc  was planning to sell down some of its 98.18 percent stake in PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna Tbk and raise at least $1 billion. The share offering comes a time when Indonesia’s economic growth is at its weakest in six years and tougher rules on television advertising are weighing on the cigarette industry. However, Sampoerna’s nearly 35 percent market share makes it attractive to potential investors, bankers have said. The company sells some of the most popular cigarette brands, including Dji Sam Soe and U Mild, in Indonesia, a country where smoking remains widespread. Sampoerna competes with PT Gudang Garam Tbk and Djarum Group in Indonesia. The Indonesian stock exchange requires all listed firms to have a free float of at least 7.5 percent by Jan. 30, 2016. Sampoerna can meet the rule if Philip Morris renounces its rights. The share sale would be the biggest in Indonesia since a $4.4 billion deal by PT Bakrie & Brothers Tbk in April 2008. It would also be the largest in Southeast Asia since Singapore lender Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp raised $2.6 billion from shareholders to bolster its capital last September. Credit Suisse, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Mandiri Sekuritas are working on the Sampoerna deal, IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, has said.

The deal, to be concluded by early 2016 pending regulatory approval, includes related trademarks and subsidiaries primarily in Japan and Europe, where operations will continue unchanged, Japan Tobacco said. (bit.ly/1ODQ2zd) The former state monopoly, still 33.4 percent owned by the Japanese government, has been expanding since privatization in 1994. It bought the non-U.S. tobacco business of RJR Nabisco Inc for around $7.8 billion in 1999 and British peer Gallaher Plc for about $18.8 billion in 2007. Its latest deal will help in its pursuit of Philip Morris International Inc and British American Tobacco Plc  to become the world’s biggest cigarette maker. The company said Japan accounts for the majority of Natural American Spirit’s sales volume outside the United States, with smokers mainly in their 20s and 30s. Buying the premium brand would extend Japan Tobacco’s product line-up, President and Chief Executive Officer Mitsuomi Koizumi said. Koizumi’s counterpart at Reynolds American, Susan M. Cameron, said Natural American Spirit would benefit from a sale to a global company such as Japan Tobacco, rather than Reynolds American investing to support the brand internationally. Cameron also said the sale will allow Reynolds American to focus on the United States, as all international rights to its cigarette trademarks will be owned by international tobacco companies. Its Camel and Winston brands are also owned abroad by Japan Tobacco. Reynolds American hired JP Morgan Securities and Lazard as financial advisors, and Jones Day as legal advisor. A spokesman at Japan Tobacco, which did not elaborate on financial details, said the company will use cash on hand and bank loans.

115,PM,UPDATE 1-Australia wins court challenge to tobacco plain packaging,"(Adds Australian govt and Philip Morris reaction, background) By Matt Siegel SYDNEY, Dec 18 (Reuters) - A Singapore-based court has refused a challenge by Philip Morris to Australia’s landmark plain packaging legislation passed in 2011, which the tobacco giant had brought under a bi-lateral trade treaty with Hong Kong, the company said. The Permanent Court of Arbitration declined on jurisdictional grounds to allow the case to proceed, effectively ending the challenge through this venue, which was based on claims that Australia was violating intellectual property laws. The decision by the court not to hear the case is likely to be seen as a major victory for Australia, which is facing challenges in other forums such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO), and for other countries considering similar laws. Australia was the first country in the world to force manufacturers to strip all branding from cigarette packets, most of which are now sold over the counter from blank fronted cabinets, although other countries have followed its lead. The court said on its website that it would make its decision public once any potentially confidential material within it had been redacted. Australian Minister for Rural Health Fiona Nash, who is responsible for government tobacco policy, welcomed the decision. “Plain packaging is a legitimate public health measure which is consistent with Australia’s international legal obligations,” she said in a statement. Philip Morris blasted the ruling, saying that Australia had exploited procedural issues to avoid an open discussion about the effectiveness of plain packaging in curbing tobacco consumption. “There is nothing in today’s ruling that addresses, let alone validates, plain packaging in Australia or anywhere else,” Marc Firestone, Philip Morris International Senior Vice President, said in a press release. “It is regrettable that the outcome hinged entirely on a procedural issue that Australia chose to advocate instead of confronting head on the merits of whether plain packaging is legal or even works.” The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is currently considering a separate challenge to Australia’s legislation by four member states, and a flurry of challenges by tobacco companies are ongoing as more countries follow Australia’s lead. The court’s decision would not have any bearing on the WTO case or any of the other legal challenges currently underway.

118,PM,UPDATE 2-Big Tobacco faces blow as top court adviser backs EU law,"* Advocate General says EU tobacco law is valid, proportionate * Opinions are non-binding but often influence rulings * Tobacco firms remain hopeful that court view will diverge   (Adds comments; changes headline) By Michele Sinner and Martinne Geller LUXEMBOURG/LONDON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - An adviser to Europe’s highest court said an EU law on cigarettes was valid, rebuffing a challenge from Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco, though the court still has to deliver a final ruling. The opinion, if adopted by the court in Luxembourg, would be a blow to Big Tobacco companies, which had lobbied vigorously against what was seen as some of the world’s strictest anti-tobacco legislation. In a majority of cases, opinions of the court advisers are reflected in the final ruling, which should follow in the coming months. “(The advocate general) considers the EU tobacco directive of 2014 to be valid,” the opinion published on Wednesday said. “The EU legislature did not exceed the considerable latitude to be given to it in ensuring that tobacco and related products may be placed on the market under uniform conditions throughout the EU without losing sight of the fundamental objective of a high level of health protection.” Smoking is the biggest cause of premature death in the European Union, responsible for nearly 700,000 deaths per year. The EU Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) was adopted in May 2014 and comes into force next year. Key provisions include the standardisation of packaging, a prohibition by 2020 on menthol cigarettes and special rules for e-cigarettes. The opinion also said an effort by Poland — the EU’s top menthol producer and consumer — to annul the menthol ban must be dismissed as “none of its arguments ... is well founded”. The TPD requires health warnings that include discouraging  images to cover 65 percent of tobacco packages. It stipulates cigarette boxes should be rectangular with at least 20 cigarettes, thereby banning slimmer 10-stick packs more attractive to occasional smokers. The e-cigarette rules, which the opinion called “relatively moderate,” include a duty to notify regulators six months before products go on sale, prohibitions on advertising and sponsorship and a maximum nicotine content for e-liquids of 20 mg/ml. The TPD also preserves the right of member states to introduce stricter packaging rules, such as the “plain packaging” law due to go into effect in Britain next year banning all colours and logos on cigarette boxes. In so doing, Marlboro maker Philip Morris claims the TPD would disrupt the internal market of EU. “The directive inexplicably encourages a patchwork of regulations and disregards important limits on the scope of EU legislation,” a Philip Morris spokeswoman said. Philip Morris and British American, the two largest international tobacco firms, as well as Japan Tobacco International and Imperial Tobacco Group are challenging the legality of the UK plain packaging law in separate proceedings. A verdict is expected there in coming months. Striking down the TPD would cripple Britain’s plan to be the second country after Australia to institute the measure, aimed at reducing the number of young smokers by making the packages less attractive. Tobacco companies don’t break out sales by country, but they say Australia’s move has been ineffective at accelerating a long-term downward trend in smoking. British American, maker of Dunhill cigarettes, said it was “obviously disappointed” with Wednesday’s opinion. “We have always maintained that the (TPD) represents an unlawful and disproportionate incursion into the autonomy of the Member States and we remain hopeful that the Court of Justice will uphold our challenge,” a spokesman said.

Syqe, which was formed in 2011, says it has already developed an inhaler that allows medical cannabis to be delivered in a safe and precise manner.

123,PM,Consumer companies' outperformance no longer guaranteed by cheap oil,"LONDON (Reuters) - Consumer companies are offering investors a small degree of relief from the turmoil in banking and resources in a results season dominated by fears about slowing economic growth.   But those companies say lower oil prices no longer translate into a traditional boost for spending on their products because households are using the money saved at the gas pump and on energy bills to stash cash, pay off debt or on other items. This means those companies may not be as much of a safe haven investment as they used to be in times of low commodities prices or economic stress.  Since 2008, food and beverage stocks have offered a 142 percent total shareholder return, nearly double that of the market overall, according to Thomson Reuters global equity indices. Since the start of the year, they have lost 3.4 percent, versus 12 percent for the global index.   “In the context of a market that’s in meltdown, the performance consumer goods has been delivering is pretty good,” said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. Consumer stalwarts PepsiCo PEP.N, Unilever (ULVR.L) and French cosmetics firm L’Oreal (OREP.PA) all reported better-than-expected revenue in contrast to dismal results from banks including Credit Suisse CSGN.VX and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE)  and oil, gas and mining firms. Tobacco company Philip Morris International (PM.N) gave a strong outlook and liquor giant Diageo (DGE.L) reported improvements. There have also been good results from General Motors (GM.N), Adidas (ADSGn.DE) and Norwegian Air (NWC.OL), and analysts are on the lookout for similar trends next week in reports from Nestle NESN.VX, Michelin (MICP.PA), Puma (PUMG.DE) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL.N). Consumer confidence has risen in the United States and Europe, nearing 2007 levels, and car sales, which analysts call a good proxy for discretionary spending, are showing promise of staying healthy in 2016. But companies need to work harder to win over consumers, according to PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi. “In the past, we used to say when gas prices came down there used to be a perceptible increase in convenience store traffic,” Nooyi told analysts this week. “Yes, we did see an increase in convenience store traffic (of about 6 percent), but I think that game has played out. Now it’s going to be how much innovation you put on the shelves and how you execute.” L’Oreal Chief Executive Jean-Paul Agon said he was surprised by the lack of any fuel-related benefit.  “When I ran L’Oreal US ten years ago, every 10 cent, or 20 cents less in the price of the gas translated immediately into more consumption,” Agon said. “We started the year, last year, with the idea that the reduction in the price of gas would probably mean an acceleration of the consumption ... and honestly, we did not see it at all.” “We did not see it in America, we did not see it in Western Europe. So we don’t have some precise explanation about it. Maybe some people are doing more savings or spending money on other categories.” With global oil consumption around 95 million barrels per day, the drop in prices from $115 per barrel in June 2014 to around $30 now has resulted in savings of about $8 billion per day for oil importers, said Laith Khalef, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers.  “That’s a pretty big stimulus to those oil consumers, but we haven’t really seen it yet,” Khalef said. “That’s a theme that perhaps is not being played out in the market. Part of the reason the fuel price benefit is more muffled than in previous cycles, analysts say, is because consumers are paying down their own debt, uncertain about their future wage growth. Another reason is that there are more things to spend money on that are not tracked by traditional measures, such as online home-sharing service Airbnb or car ride service Uber. “The consumer has arguably been swinging his money around, and is not consistently going anywhere,” said Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt. “This month it’s at the retail outlets, next month it’s at the cinema and maybe after that it’s a new app.”  Consumer staples stocks, which include Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), have been trading at historically high multiples, anywhere from 18 times earnings to more than 30 times, buoyed by the fact that they are stable, have decent yields in a low interest rate environment and exposure to emerging markets, which up until recently, were significant offsets to weak mature markets.  Even though they have tempered their forecasts in the wake of the downturn, they are still seeing top- and bottom-line growth, and many investors are prepared to pay up for that, especially with so many other sectors sinking. “They (investors) are saying ‘Look the world is terrible, I’m going to lose money in most places. I’m prepared to pay a high price to be confident for a little bit of growth’,” said Ali Miremadi, fund manager at THS Partners in London which owns shares of Unilever, Nestle, Pepsi and Mondelez International (MDLZ.O). “These are all fundamentally strong companies, which assuming you are going to hold them for a reasonably long period of time, are very reasonably valued.”   Still, valuations do reach a point — somewhere around 30 times earnings — where it’s harder to justify owning a stock that is delivering only single-digit revenue growth, Miremadi said. Consumer staples do nevertheless offer income, which may become more scarce as companies such as miner Rio Tinto (RIO.L) scrap their dividend payout policies. With dividend payout ratios in the 80 to 90 percent range, tobacco stocks like Philip Morris and British American (BATS.L) lead the pack of consumer staples with yields of 4.5 percent. “Things could be going better, but if people are looking for defensive qualities and income from their equity investments, staples gives you both of those on a fairly reliable basis,” said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.

132,PM,Wall St pours money into consumer staples as valuations climb,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Investors looking for stability and dividends have been pouring money into consumer staples stocks of late, ignoring warnings from Wall Street’s analysts about pricey valuations for companies like Clorox (CLX.N) and Campbell Soup (CPB.N). Widely viewed as relatively safe bets in a world of macroeconomic worries, shares of companies selling everyday consumer products like processed food and cleaning supplies have outperformed most other sectors in the past year, and fund flow data suggests investors expect more of the same. The number of new institutional owners, like hedge funds, pension funds and mutual funds, of Campbell Soup in the last quarter has jumped 92 percent, according to research firm Morningstar. New institutional owners of Coca Cola Co rose 81 percent. In the past two weeks, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPRD ETF (XLP) attracted $333 million in net flows while just $105 million went into the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR fund (XLY), according to ETF.com. With relatively high dividend yields, including a 4 percent annual payout to shareholders from Philip Morris International (PM.N), consumer staples companies remain a key holding for investors worried about a shaky global economy, even as the United States shows signs of slow improvement.  Consumer staples companies in the S&P; 500 are expected on average to post 3.7 percent higher earnings in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That is better than an expected 0.8-percent increase across the S&P; 500 but not as good as the 12.4-percent earnings jump predicted for the consumer discretionary sector.  “We still want a fair amount of exposure to staples,” said Thomas Martin, a portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments, which owns shares in Campbell, Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL.N), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) and tobacco companies.  “The economy is still bumping along on a slow-growth trajectory,” he said. The S&P; consumer staples index .SPLRCS now trades at about 20 times expected earnings, compared with 17 for the consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Following the consumer staples index’s 12 percent rise in the past year, some analysts warn of high valuations, with General Mills (GIS.N), Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and most other companies in the sector trading above 20 times expected earnings, compared with an average of 17 across the S&P; 500. “On the consumer defensive side, we view in general the industry as a bit inflated,” said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash.  A year ago, Campbell Soup, Kellogg (K.N), McCormick & Company (MKC.N) and Clorox were among the 10 S&P; 500 stocks with the worst average recommendations by sell-side analysts. Many of them warned about a strong dollar’s impact on demand overseas and stagnant sales as consumer tastes shifted toward fresher foods. But since then, those stocks have each gained between 21 percent and 31 percent, lifted by cost-cutting initiatives that have improved margins and progress updating their product lineups to appeal to new consumer tastes for “natural” and organic food. The S&P; 500 is up 1 percent from a year ago. ",6062016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-consumerstaples-stocks/wall-st-pours-money-into-consumer-staples-as-valuations-climb-idUSL1N18S1FH

134,PM,Phillip Morris loses tough-on-tobacco lawsuit in Uruguay,"MONTEVIDEO (Reuters) - The World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) ruled in favor of Uruguay on Friday in a suit filed by Philip Morris International seeking compensation for economic damages caused by the nation’s anti-tobacco measures.  Uruguay imposed a ban on smoking in public spaces in 2006, as it raised taxes on tobacco products and forced firms to include large warnings and graphic images including diseased lungs and rotting teeth on cigarette packages. It also banned the use of the words “light” and “mild” from cigarette packs to try to dispel smokers’ misguided beliefs that the products are safer. “The health measures we implemented for controlling tobacco usage and for protecting the health of our people have been expressly recognized as legitimate and also adopted as part of the sovereign power of our republic,” Uruguayan President Tabare Vazquez said in a televised speech. Vazquez, an oncologist, helped spearhead the measures during his first term in office from 2005 to 2010. In a lengthy decision published on Friday, the ICSID said it had ruled to dismiss Philip Morris’ demand that the regulations be withdrawn, or not applied to the company, or that it be paid $22 million in damages instead. It ordered the tobacco company to pay Uruguay $7 million and to cover “all the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID’s administrative fees and expenses.” Phillip Morris said it respected the tribunal’s decision. “We’ve never questioned Uruguay’s authority to protect public health, and this case wasn’t about broad issues of tobacco policy,” Marc Firestone, Philip Morris International senior vice president and general counsel, said in a statement. “The arbitration concerned an important, but unusual, set of facts that called for clarification under international law,” added Firestone. The tobacco company said that it would like to meet with Uruguay’s government, to explore regulatory frameworks that would enable smokers “in the country to have informed access to reduced-risk alternatives to smoking.” Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), the oldest anti-tobacco organization in the United States, applauded Uruguay for winning the case, but said Phillip Morris “accomplished its primary goal.” Phillip Morris “will no doubt shed some public crocodile tears, but their main goal in launching the suit has been realized, six years and millions of dollars have been spent defending a nondiscriminatory law that was intended purely to protect public health,” said Laurent Huber, executive director for ASH. “This has already resulted in regulatory chill in other countries, preventing tobacco legislation that would have saved lives,” Huber said.

138,PM,Fitch Affirms Philip Morris International at 'A'; Outlook Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, August 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed US-based tobacco group  Philip Morris International, Inc's (PMI) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR)  and senior unsecured long-term rating at 'A'. PMI's Short-Term IDR and  short-term debt rating are affirmed at 'F1'. The Outlook on the Long-Term IDR is  Negative. The ratings reflect the strong operating profile of PMI, supported by its  leading market shares and pricing power, which translates into a healthy  operating EBITDA margin for the sector in excess of 40%. However, this is  balanced by a lack of leverage headroom. Fitch expects PMI's funds from  operations (FFO)-adjusted gross leverage over 2016-2018 to be slightly above the  3.0x maximum threshold compatible with the current 'A' rating. Fitch expects PMI  to retain strong overall financial flexibility and to maintain a prudent  financial policy as we do not assume the resumption of share buybacks and  acquisitions during 2016-2019. The Negative Outlook reflects our expectation of profit margin erosion and  limited free cash flow (FCF) after dividends over 2016-2017, due in part to  investment in reduced risk products (RRPs), and high financial leverage for the  ratings. We also expect credit metrics to continue to be impacted, albeit  decreasingly, by currency depreciation.  A one-notch downgrade could result from PMI's cash flows being permanently  impaired due to continued investments, operating challenges in key markets or  elevated shareholder distributions. The Outlook may be revised back to Stable if  PMI's superior price/product mix growth and evidence of RRPs breaking even,  without profit margin dilution, translate into strengthening FCF generation,  while maintaining a conservative financial policy. KEY RATING DRIVERS No Leverage Headroom PMI's FFO-adjusted gross leverage continued to increase to 3.3x in 2015 (2014:  3.2x), above the 3.0x ceiling for PMI's 'A' rating. Fitch forecasts FFO gross  leverage over 2016-2018 to continue to be above 3.0x, driven by RRPs-related  capital expenditure and continued currency depreciation, albeit to a lesser  extent during 2016-2017.  Fitch revised the Outlook to Negative in July 2015, reflecting PMI's stretched  credit metrics, after profit margin and compressed cash flow in 2014 due to  market challenges, investments in RRPs, and the negative impact from currency  depreciation. Shareholder returns also contributed to exacerbating the  deterioration of credit metrics.   RRPs' Potential Fitch believes that, combined with PMI's market clout, the products that the  company has available (i.e. iQOS) and under development, should allow it to win  market share against peers. We believe PMI's guidance for incremental operating  companies' income (OCI) from RRPs of between USD720m and USD1.2bn pa. by 2020 is  achievable given the current success enjoyed, especially in Japan where PMI has  now reached capacity limits for its Heatsticks (refills for its heat-not-burn  iQOS product). PMI has begun commercialisation of iQOS since October 2014. Japan  was the first market with nationwide roll-out in April 2016.  However, investments in RRPs since 2014 have further impacted operating profit.  Fitch expects FCF (post-dividend) to be neutral over 2016-2017, due in part to  increased capital expenditure in RRPs, yet we envisage FCF margin would trend  towards 4% by 2018 (2015: 2.4%) which could contribute to a revision of the  Outlook to Stable. Shareholder Distribution Revisited Fitch also views positively the suspension of PMI's share buyback in 2015,  indicating a willingness to protect the company's credit metrics. PMI has  historically distributed to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks,  more than the FCF it generated. A large part of those share buybacks has  historically been debt-funded, which has resulted in an increase in debt quantum  over time. Undistributed Foreign Earnings (UFE) PMI faces a mismatch between the location of its earnings and debt, given that  the company does not have any sales in the US while debt is raised at the  holding company domiciled in the US. While PMI regularly repatriates the  majority of its foreign earnings, a portion of it is held abroad.  The company had USD3.4bn of cash and cash equivalent on balance sheet at  end-2015, all held outside of the US. While Fitch recognised that this cash  balance can be accessed, it also attracts a potential tax cost when repatriated.  Our adjusted net leverage ratios now include a generic 35% tax haircut on cash,  which is based on our conservative assumption that, if repatriated back to the  US, these cash balances would be subject to the maximum US tax rate.  Nevertheless, gross leverage remains a primary ratio for Fitch when evaluating  PMI.  Strong Organic Revenue Performance  In 2015, the company reported pricing gain of 6.8% (2014: 4.8%) and volume  decline of only 1% (2014: -2.8%), its best performance since 2012. As a result  organic revenue grew  5.8% while adjusted OCI grew 6.6% (2014: flat). This trend  continued in 1H16, where the company reported still reasonable pricing gain of  5.1% but declining volumes, resulting in organic revenue growth of 1.9%. We  expect PMI's organic growth for 2016 to be stable, driven by better  price/product mix, against a predictable global excise tax environment and  stable global illicit trade activities.  Regulatory Changes Manageable Fitch views the impact of smoking bans, cabinet display bans and graphic health  warnings on consumption, including the revised European Union Trade Product  Directive, as broadly manageable.  Following its introduction in Australia since 2012, the UK and France  implemented plain packaging in May 2016 with full compliance at the retail level  by January 2017 in France and by May 2017 in the UK. In Ireland, implementation  is subject to a Ministerial Commencement Order, which has yet to be issued. We  believe that while plain packaging erodes the pricing power for more premium  brands and in the longer-term could contribute to reducing the number of new  smokers, the medium-term effect on tobacco companies is manageable, due to their  geographic diversification and to the still limited popularity of this  regulation.  Leading Industry Player The ratings continue to reflect the leading position of PMI in the global  tobacco industry (excluding the US and China), supported by the diversity of its  portfolio of brands and the countries in which it operates. It enjoys large  market shares and pricing leadership in many of the most profitable and growing  tobacco markets, with superior diversification across continents. All these  factors remain consistent with a strong 'A' IDR in relation to other sector  peers and compensate for the elevated leverage which would, in isolation, lead  to a lower rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for issuer include:   - Revenue and profits impacted by currency headwinds as well as investments in  RRPs in 2016-2017 - Low single-digit sales growth and slight increase in profitability from 2018  onwards with price gains offsetting volume declines - Neutral FCF generation with FCF margin resuming to around 4% from 2018 onwards - Dividends increasing 2%-3% annually, resulting in a dividend pay-out ratio of  around 80%-90% between 2016 and 2019 - No share buybacks between 2016 and 2019 RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include:   - Persistently weaker-than-historical performance with low or negative organic  growth, the continuation of negative currency impact and slower-than-expected  progress of RRPs leading to operating EBITDA margin remaining under 45% (2015:  42.7%) - FCF margin failing to return to at least 3.5%- 4% of revenues (2015: 2.4%) - High debt levels or failure to increase FFO causing FFO-adjusted gross  leverage to remain permanently within the 3.0x-3.5x range (2015: 3.3x) and  FFO-adjusted net leverage above 2.8x (2015: 3.0x) - FFO fixed charge coverage below 6x (2015: 7.5x) - Unfavourable tobacco litigation outcome requiring PMI to pay a large  compensation Positive: Fitch does not currently expect management to pursue financial  policies that would be commensurate with an upgrade. However, future  developments that could lead to a revision of the Outlook to Stable include: -Improving FCF due to debt reduction, resulting in FFO-adjusted gross leverage  trending below 3.0x or FFO-adjusted net leverage below 2.5x by 2018 - FCF margin on track to recover to a level sustainably above 4% beyond 2017 - FFO fixed charge coverage sustainably above 6x - No material cash outflow from ongoing litigation LIQUIDITY At end-2015, PMI's gross debt of USD28.5bn was well spread out with no more than  USD3bn of bonds maturing in a given year. Fitch views liquidity backstop  resources of up to USD8bn are more than adequate.

141,PM,European fund firms largely resist tobacco divestment campaign,"LONDON (Reuters) - Eighteen months after the launch of a global campaign to persuade money managers to black-list tobacco stocks, just one major European investor has answered the rallying cry. Others are largely sticking with an industry that remains lucrative despite tightening restrictions on smoking and a series of lawsuits in the United States, saying they are duty-bound to seek the best returns for their clients. Even a United Nations-backed treaty which aims to cut tobacco consumption by almost a third within 10 years is failing to deter many investors in the likes of Philip Morris International (PM.N), British American Tobacco (BATS.L), Japan Tobacco (2914.T) and Imperial Brands (IMB.L). “We are firmly of the view that profits, cash and dividends from tobacco stocks have many years of strong growth ahead,” said Stephen Lamacraft, fund manager at Woodford Investment Management. Still, the Global Taskforce for Tobacco Free Portfolios, backed by the Union for International Cancer Control, has scored one big victory since it began campaigning in March 2015 for financial institutions and pension funds to divest an estimated $60 billion from the industry. In May this year, French insurer and fund manager Axa agreed to ditch its tobacco holdings, becoming the first major European investor to sign up to the campaign, although others had already opted out of tobacco before it was launched. Axa said its role as a health insurer meant it could no longer justify investing in something that had such a “tragic” impact on public health. At the time it held 200 million euros in tobacco stocks and about 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in bonds issued by the cigarette makers.  Even then, the process is lengthy. Axa has almost completed selling the shares but will keep the bonds until they mature. Only in 2027 will the bulk - 97 percent - be off its books. Many other investors appear reluctant to discuss the issue. Reuters contacted 24 large fund managers which hold tobacco stocks, and all but seven declined comment or did not respond. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tobacco kills around 6 million people each year, including 600,000 non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke. Many of the passive victims are children. The Taskforce’s global Project Manager, Melbourne-based Bronwyn King, has persuaded more than 30 Australian superannuation funds to ditch tobacco but the campaign faces a tougher challenge in Europe.  The same goes for the United States, where one influential investor, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System is reviewing a 16-year investment ban on tobacco after a study estimated the policy had cost it $2 billion to $3 billion in returns. Campaigners reject the fiduciary duty argument - that funds must seek the best returns for their clients. They note that about 180 countries have signed up to the WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which aims to cut consumption by 30 percent by 2025 through new regulations and tax increases that will make tobacco less affordable. Currently just a handful of countries fully comply with the treaty, implying a significant future hit to the value of tobacco stocks when others follow suit. “Over the longer term, (the treaty) has to decrease the validity of the product – you will have fewer people wanting or being able to buy tobacco and that has to impact the investment appeal of the producers,” said Rachel Melsom, UK director of campaign group Tobacco Free Portfolios. Philip Morris International, Imperial Brands and BAT declined to comment. Japan Tobacco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The tobacco industry sells about 5.6 trillion cigarettes a year to the world’s 1 billion smokers, many of whom live in low and middle-income countries. Here consumption is expected to keep rising due to growing populations and income. More people are quitting smoking or cutting down in developed countries, but overall revenue and profit margins are consistently buoyed by companies’ ability to raise prices. International players have also largely shielded themselves from direct exposure to the U.S. market, which has a history of litigation against big tobacco companies. For instance, Philip Morris has been separated from Altria (MO.N), which sells its Marlboro cigarettes in the United States. In the 10 years to 2015 - a period that included the crisis of 2008-09 - the MSCI World Tobacco Index rose 10.4 percent compared with just 2.64 percent on the MSCI World Index. All this appeals to many fund managers. For instance, the  9.2 billion pound ($12.3 billion) CF Woodford Equity Income Fund managed by veteran fund manager Neil Woodford holds BAT and Imperial Brands - makers of the Lucky Strike and Gauloises brands respectively - among its top 10 positions. “(Tobacco’s) dependable dividends are increasingly highly-prized and still represent attractive yields,” said Lamacraft. The dividend argument doesn’t always hold water. London-listed British American and Imperial reported dividend yields of 3.2 percent and 3.78 percent respectively, compared with an average 4.06 percent across the FTSE 100 index. New-York listed Philip Morris International has a 4.01 percent dividend yield. Louise Dudley, portfolio manager at Hermes Investment, said she has barred tobacco stocks because she believes returns are unsustainable in the long-term. “The industry has faced and continues to face increased regulation and consumers are becoming more aware of the health impacts of tobacco. The general trend is towards more healthy lifestyles. Tobacco products don’t tend to fit within that.” A spokeswoman for Standard Life Investments (SLI) said its decision not to black-list tobacco reflected the needs and views of its clients. But Melsom said ordinary savers didn’t always know where their money was being invested. “If every individual who has a pension fund could see their level of investment in tobacco and the costs associated with that, I think that would make a difference,” she said. Client attitudes towards tobacco varied widely, according to Iain Richards, Head of Responsible Investment, EMEA, at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “We are satisfied that, for our mainstream funds, our approach is measured, works well and serves our clients’ best interests. We therefore don’t intend to adopt a blanket divestment policy on tobacco,” he said. Amra Balic, Head of BlackRock’s EMEA Investment Stewardship team (BLK.N), said her firm did not make social, ethical or environmental values judgments on behalf of clients, and company engagement was critical in addressing the health and social risks of tobacco. “I don’t think that we will end up, by divestment, in a world where tobacco won’t exist, therefore engagement by responsible investors is key to holding companies to account on ESG (environmental, social and governance) issues”.  A spokeswoman for M&G;, another investor in the sector, said it regularly discussed environmental, social and ethical risks with tobacco company management, and encouraged improvements where it considered performance to be poor. SLI, BlackRock, M&G;, Columbia Threadneedle, Handelsbanken and Aberdeen Asset Management all said clients could bypass tobacco with their socially responsible investment (SRI) funds. Handelsbanken said about 40 percent of the assets that it manages are in funds that exclude tobacco investments. The performance of SRI funds, which often also avoid  industries such as armaments and alcohol, is typically benchmarked against indexes that exclude tobacco firms. But mainstream funds are benchmarked against indexes that usually include them. Any that chooses to drop tobacco stocks is likely to underperform its benchmark index, putting pressure on managers to stick with the status quo. “You need to benchmark against other funds that don’t include tobacco and see how you how perform in other investments you have put in its place,” Melsom said.

145,PM,Japan Tobacco to roll out e-cigarette next year,"LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco is aiming to start rolling out its Ploom Tech tobacco-based e-cigarette in cities across Japan next year, a senior executive said on Friday, as it fights to catch up to larger rival Philip Morris. Japan Tobacco, the world’s third-largest tobacco company, has invested heavily in expanding its manufacturing capacity of tobacco capsules used with the Ploom Tech, after it hit supply constraints in March after a test launch in the southern city of Fukuoka. The company will launch Ploom Tech in select major cities in early 2017, Kiyohide Hirowatari, head of tobacco business planning, said at an investor meeting on Friday in London. He said the company will have increased its capacity by four times by the end of this year and ten times by the end of next year. Japan Tobacco, whose cigarettes include Benson & Hedges and Mevius, said its international tobacco business was well positioned to achieve its forecast for full-year growth of 11.4 percent in profit. It also expects growth of 8.1 percent in revenue and 2 percent in sales volume.

149,PM,CORRECTED-British American Tobacco to test tobacco e-cigarette in Japan,"TOKYO/LONDON (Reuters) - British American Tobacco PLC (BAT) plans to test a new tobacco-based cigarette alternative in Japan next month, it said on Tuesday, taking aim at Philip Morris International Inc’s popular iQOS and Japan Tobacco Inc’s Ploom Tech.   BAT said it plans to launch its new product, called “glo”, on Dec. 12 in the northeastern city of Sendai. It will then use learning from that launch to expand the product nationwide.  Glo electronically heats tobacco enough to create an inhalable vapor. That vapor, according to BAT, has about 90 percent less toxicant than smoke. The temperature of glo and the Kent Neostiks that go with it, is about 240 degrees Celsius, whereas combustion in traditional cigarettes takes place at over 800 degrees.   BAT has invested more than $1 billion over the past five years in the development, scale up and launch of cigarette alternatives. It sells Vype e-cigarettes, which use nicotine liquid, in several European markets and is testing iFuse, a liquid-based e-cigarette that also uses tobacco, in Romania.  BAT has also developed a nicotine inhaler called Voke that can be licensed as a medical product in Britain, but it is not yet on the market. The glo device will cost 8,000 yen ($76.61) with packs of twenty Kent Neostiks, which come in three flavors, costing 420 yen ($4.02). BAT is also in the process of buying U.S. peer Reynolds American Inc in a $47 billion takeover that would create the world’s biggest listed tobacco company.  All big tobacco companies are investing in tobacco alternatives, as the cigarette market in most Western countries declines with more people giving up the habit. Some analysts think tobacco-based vapor products will be more successful at attracting cigarette smokers since they use tobacco and might therefore be more satisfying for smokers who cannot quit.  Philip Morris chose Japan as a test market for its “heat not burn” product due in part to regulations around nicotine liquid.  Its iQOS, introduced nationwide in Japan in April, has turned out so popular that supplies are short. “At this moment, we are seeing far greater demand than our expectations and iQOS devices sell out as soon as they hit stores,” said a Philip Morris Japan spokeswoman. Japan Tobacco has also said production of its Ploom Tech has not caught up with demand. It has suspended taking orders on its online store and is limiting supply to stores in the city of Fukuoka, where it is test sold.

151,PM,UPDATE 2-Reynolds American rejects BAT's $47 bln takeover offer - source,"(Reuters) - U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc is seeking a higher price from British American Tobacco Plc after rejecting its $47 billion takeover offer, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters.  Last month, British American Tobacco, which already owns 42 percent of Reynolds American, offered to buy the remaining shares of the maker of Camel and Newport cigarettes to create the world’s biggest listed tobacco company. “We thought it was a possibility, so it’s not too surprising,” Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck said in an email. “Depending on how another offer from BATS could be structured, there’s a bit of a circular argument here for the value of RAI,” Fleck said. The companies are still in talks and BAT is willing to increase the price slightly, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter. (bloom.bg/2fQxNIu) Altria controls 51 percent of the U.S. market and Reynolds 34 percent. Analysts estimate the Reynolds’ acquisition would make the United States account for about 40 percent of BAT sales and 50 percent of its profits. BAT’s cash-and-stock offer would mark the return of the company to the lucrative and highly regulated U.S. market after a 12-year absence, making it the only tobacco giant with a leading presence in the American and international markets. Some analysts have predicted that the deal could encourage current market leader Philip Morris International to reunite with its U.S. affiliate Altria, reversing a 2008 spin-off of the international business. Both Reynolds American and BAT declined to comment. Bloomberg was the first to report on Reynolds’ rejection. Reynolds American had a market capitalization of about $76 billion as of Monday’s close of $53.05. The company’s stock had risen nearly 15 percent this year.

152,PM,Philip Morris looks beyond cigarettes with alternative products,"LONDON (Reuters) - Philip Morris International (PM.N), the world’s largest international tobacco company, said it could eventually stub out cigarette sales as it launched an alternative product in Britain on Wednesday. Underlining the regulatory pressures facing the tobacco industry, a British court also on Wednesday rejected an appeal against new rules prohibiting the use of marketing such as logos or colors on cigarette packs. The British government’s victory could spur other countries to follow suit, highlighting the need for tobacco companies to develop alternatives to cigarettes to respond to health concerns that are leading more people to quit a habit responsible for an estimated 6 million deaths a year. Executives from Philip Morris, which sells Marlboros everywhere except the United States, said their ultimate goal was to phase out cigarettes.  “We certainly see a future where Philip Morris no longer will be selling cigarettes in the market,” Martin Inkster, managing director of Philip Morris UK and Ireland, told Reuters. He said that would take many years and require the help of governments and regulators. Philip Morris still produces more than 870 billion cigarettes each year. Philip Morris, along with British American Tobacco (BATS.L), Japan Tobacco International (2914.T) and Imperial Brands (IMB.L), mounted a legal challenge to Britain’s plain packaging law that was shot down by a High Court in May. Philip Morris did not join in the appeal brought by the other three, saying it preferred to focus on lower-risk products such as IQOS. It has not explained the origin of the name, but some observers have dubbed it “I Quit Ordinary Smoking”.     The company said IQOS, the result of a decade of research and $3 billion of investment, was a step toward a smokeless future. The device, already on sale in over a dozen markets including Japan, Switzerland and Italy, electronically heats tobacco enough to produce a vapor without burning it. The company says the vapor has less than 10 percent of the amount of harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke.  It plans to have IQOS in 20 markets by the end of this year, and as many as 35 by the end of next year. In the UK, it will cost 45 pounds ($56.14), with a single pack of 20 tobacco sticks, called HEETS, costing 8 pounds ($9.98). The UK is poised to be a big test for IQOS, since its e-cigarette market is more developed than several of IQOS’s other markets. Japan Tobacco and BAT (BATS.L) are testing their own tobacco-based products and are pushing hard to catch up to Philip Morris in delivering products that fill the space where the current generation of e-cigarettes — which use nicotine-laced liquid — fail.  BAT, which is in talks to buy Reynolds American RAI.N for more than $47 billion, has spent about $700 million over the past five years to develop next-generation products.  Its line-up is more diverse than those of its peers, including the “glo” tobacco device, various Vype e-cigarettes and an inhaler called Voke certified as a medical product.  “Different segments of consumers will prefer different products,” David O’Reilly, BAT’s group scientific and R&D; director, told Reuters earlier this month. “That’s why we have a multi-category approach.”  With e-cigarettes he said nicotine is not immediately absorbed by the lungs as it is with smoking, so the chemical satisfaction is delayed. But “heat not burn” products deliver a quicker and more authentic hit. PMI and BAT both have various other products in development.  PMI is working on a tobacco stick that uses a carbon tip as a heat source to generate vapor, in a product that is even closer to a traditional cigarette as the whole thing can be thrown away after use. That technology is similar to one owned by Reynolds, which BAT would acquire if its planned acquisition goes through. BAT is also working on technology whereby an e-cigarette could deliver an immediate nicotine hit, like tobacco, that smokers may find more satisfying. Imperial Brands (IMB.L), the fourth-largest tobacco company, has so far stuck with e-cigarettes, which are also widely sold by independent start-ups.  Health campaigners remained cautious. “If smokers switch to electronic cigarettes or other products that can be shown to cut the risks to their health, this could lead to a big improvement in public health,” said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of UK health charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH). “But we need independent evidence to support any claims made by the tobacco industry.”  ASH said that until independent evidence shows that IQOS and similar products are substantially less harmful than smoking, they should be regulated in the same way as cigarettes.

153,PM,Philip Morris seeks U.S. approval to market alternative cigarette,"(Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) filed a much-awaited U.S. application to market a new type of cigarette that heats rather than burns tobacco and may carry fewer health risks.         The company’s application is the first to seek U.S. approval to market a tobacco product as being less harmful than traditional cigarettes. If approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the company’s iQOS device could give it a significant marketing advantage over alternatives to tobacco products, including electronic cigarettes, which are not allowed to make such a claim. The device electronically heats tobacco to produce a vapor without burning it, and the company claims the vapor has less than 10 percent of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke.  “We are encouraged by the timeliness of PM’s first FDA application submission...We continue to believe iQOS is a positive catalyst for both Philip Morris & Altria providing a unique competitive advantage,” Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a note. Philip Morris, which was spun off from Altria Group Inc (MO.N) in 2008, sells brands such as Marlboro, Red and White and Longbeach in markets outside the United States. The device is currently sold without a reduced harm claim in several countries, including Japan.     Most traditional tobacco companies are investing in tobacco alternatives as smoking in developed countries has declined.

154,PM,Vape companies try to galvanize Trump administration to ease FDA rules,"(Reuters) - As tobacco and vaping companies focus on new smoking products that are potentially less harmful, the industry sees an opening for rolling back rules on these products under the Trump administration. Donald Trump’s surprise election victory in November, and his pledges to reduce federal regulations on business, led tobacco lobby groups to draft a new plan of action, according to company executives, lobbyists and consultants interviewed by Reuters.  The immediate goal is to delay implementation of new regulations on the latest generation of e-cigarettes and other vaping devices, which produce a vapor from liquid nicotine rather than burning tobacco.  Longer-term, they are setting their sights on repealing the 2016 law that treats these devices like cigarettes.   Lobbyists describe a cautious optimism as they approach lawmakers with their plans for products that they say can help traditional smokers quit and avoid the known dangers of tobacco. With U.S. sales of conventional cigarettes shrinking, Big Tobacco has made a major bet in recent years to dominate the e-cigarette industry.  On Tuesday, British American Tobacco Plc announced a $49-billion deal to take over rival Reynolds American Inc, uniting two major e-cigarette players in the United States and United Kingdom and becoming a bigger competitor to Philip Morris International Inc and U.S. partner Altria Group. “Suddenly things that were not conceivable became something we thought we could do,” said Cynthia Cabrera, former president and executive director for the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association (SFATA). Cabrera now has her own industry consulting firm, the Cating Group.   In 2009, Congress allowed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to extend its oversight to all tobacco products. New regulations took effect last August that brought e-cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco and hookah tobacco in line with existing rules for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. They require companies to submit e-cigarettes and other newer tobacco products for government approval, list their ingredients and place health warnings on packages and in advertisements. Health advocacy groups hailed the regulations as the potential health risks and benefits of e-cigarettes are still being studied.  Industry officials said they would hurt small companies and cripple development. Opponents said the rule was especially unfair because it would apply to any products introduced after Feb. 2007, meaning that most e-cigarettes now on the market would require regulatory review.  On Tuesday, a coalition of 13 organizations, including libertarian-oriented tech groups, asked Congress to grandfather all products introduced by August 2016, when the rules took effect.  “The FDA’s regulations threaten to kill an industry that has created tens of thousands of jobs by producing safer products that help many Americans quit smoking,” the letter to Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan said. Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma wrote to incoming Vice President Mike Pence this month asking that all FDA deadlines on new tobacco products be delayed by a year as their fate is determined.  Public health advocates say they plan to fight any changes to the Tobacco Control Act, warning that fewer restrictions on e-cigarettes could hook a new generation on nicotine after years of efforts to prevent kids from smoking.   “We know e-cigarettes are the most commonly used tobacco product among kids,” said Erika Sward, assistant vice president, National Advocacy for the American Lung Association, noting the appeal of flavored nicotine liquids used in the devices. BAT makes the popular Vype brand in Europe, while Reynolds owns Vuse, the top selling brand in the United States. They have already collaborated on technology and licensing, but their merger is expected to speed up and simply innovation. “Consumers are looking for alternatives that have the potential to reduce harm,” said Susan M. Cameron, executive chairman of Reynolds American’s board of directors. Philip Morris and Altria aim to launch a promising, new technology called iQOS that heats tobacco but does not burn it, potentially preserving the qualities that smokers want with fewer health risks. The company submitted the product for FDA review in December. “There is a much higher level of hope and a general belief that a new administration would be willing to take a new look and consider a harm reduction rather than abstinence only approach to nicotine,” said Michael Hogan, a lobbyist who represents the vaping industry at the Alpine Group.

158,PM,UPDATE 3-BAT looks to double its vaping markets,"* BAT’s vaping business currently in 10 markets * Company trying to catch up with rival Philip Morris * 2016 adjusted profit from operations up 10 pct   (Adds details from media briefing) By Esha Vaish and Emma Thomasson Feb 23 (Reuters) - British American Tobacco wants to double the number of countries where it sells vaping products this year and again in 2018, it said on Thursday, as it chases rivals Philip Morris International to grab a share of a growing market. BAT and Philip Morris were the first of the big tobacco firms to invest in cigarette alternatives a few year back, as  growing health consciousness reduces traditional smoking. Earlier this year, BAT agreed to buy U.S. peer Reynolds American for $49.4 billion, a deal that will help boost its position in the small but growing market for e-cigarettes and other cigarette alternatives. However, analysts say BAT is scrambling to catch up with Philip Morris in the heated products ‘vaping’ market, where the U.S. firm has established a stronghold with its IQOS device, the result of a decade of research and $3 billion of investment. IQOS, which electronically heats tobacco enough to produce a vapour without burning it, is currently in 20 markets, including most notably Japan, and will be in as many as 30 by the end of this year, Philip Morris said on Wednesday. BAT said on Thursday it now had the biggest vapour business in the world outside of the United States and was present in 10 markets, with almost 40 percent of the market in Britain and around 50 percent in Poland. The company, which in January quit plans to market a nicotine inhaler called Voke, plans to double the number of markets where it offers cigarette alternatives this year, and again next year. “It is really only the beginning,” Kingsley Wheaton, head of next generation products at BAT, told journalists, adding BAT had invested over $1 billion in cigarette alternatives. “We are committed to delivering more innovation and less harm.” BAT said initial results were very encouraging for a new tobacco heating device called Glo it launched in Sendai, Japan in December, which takes aim at IQOS. BAT plans to roll-out and upgrade the product in 2017 and beyond. Some analysts said a lack of detail left them unimpressed, especially after Philip Morris broke out the 2016 net revenue contribution from so-called reduced risk products, which include IQOS, as $739 million, less than 1 percent of its total revenue. “In the heated product, it would be very fair to say Philip Morris is significantly ahead,” Shane MacGuill, Head of Tobacco Research at Euromonitor International, told Reuters. BAT, the maker of Dunhill and Lucky Strike cigarettes, said cigarette volume grew 0.2 percent to 665 billion in 2016, adding that although it fell 0.8 percent on an underlying basis, it outperformed the industry which saw a roughly 3 percent decline.

161,PM,Philip Morris says it has doubled supply of iQOS tobacco device in Japan,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Philip Morris International said on Thursday it has more than doubled the stock of its popular iQOS tobacco device in Japan, but demand continues to outstrip supply even as competition intensifies over smokeless products. Philip Morris said it has so far sold more than 3 million iQOS, a battery-powered device that heats tobacco leaves packed in cigarette shape. The company began nationwide sale in Japan in April last year after test marketing in major cities. The product has become an instant hit and a severe supply shortage has persisted. It is priced at 9,980 yen ($88.30), but traded at 12,000 yen or more on Internet auction sites. Paul Riley, president of Philip Morris Japan, told reporters the company has more than doubled its supply of iQOS since February and is ramping up the production to meet the demand.  “But the question is what is the demand? We continue to increase the production but they get sold out as soon as they hit the stores,” he said. Philip Morris, known for Marlboro, Lark and Parliament cigarettes, has said its market share in Japan rose 1.7 points to 27.1 percent in 2016, helped by the popularity of iQOS. Marlboro HeatSticks, cigarette-like tobacco used for iQOS, accounted for 7.6 percent of Japan’s cigarette market in January, the company said. It said it will add two flavors in March to existing four.  iQOS is currently sold in 20 markets, including most notably Japan, and will be in as many as 30 by the end of this year, Philip Morris has said. Global tobacco companies see Japan as a fertile test ground for “Heat but not burn” tobacco products, since e-cigarettes, which use nicotine-laced liquid, are not permitted under the country’s pharmaceutical regulation.

Japan Tobacco Inc, which commands over 60 percent share in domestic cigarette market, said last month it expected  its domestic cigarettes sales volume to decline by 9.6 percent this year partly because of the growing popularity of tobacco e-cigarettes.

176,PM,Philippines' Duterte gets tough on tobacco with ban on smoking in public,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has signed an executive order banning smoking in public across the second-most populous country in Southeast Asia, one of the region’s strictest anti-tobacco laws. The ban, which carries a maximum penalty of four months in jail and a fine of 5,000 pesos ($100), covers both indoor and outdoor smoking, presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella said on Thursday. It also covers existing bans on tobacco advertisements, promotions or sponsorship, which are subject to fines of up to 400,000 pesos and maximum jail terms of three years and possible revocation of business permits. Duterte was himself a heavy smoker but quit when he was diagnosed as suffering from Buerger’s disease, which can cause blockages in the blood vessels. The current ban replicates an ordinance Duterte created in 2012 in his southern hometown of Davao City, Abella said. Duterte campaigned for the presidency promising to be tough on criminals, the corrupt, and drug pushers and users and to uproot vices one by one, such as smoking and illegal gambling. The Philippine Tobacco Institute, which represents tobacco interests, was not immediately available for comment. There are eight firms making cigarettes in the Philippines. Designated smoking areas not larger than 10 sq m (12 sq yards) will be set up for adults only and must be at least 10 meters (11 yards) from building entrances or exits, according to the order signed on Tuesday. Police-led anti-smoking task forces will be created in towns and cities. The smoking ban also covers “vaping” or the use of electronic cigarettes and will apply in casinos, including gaming floors and entertainment rooms, and inside airport buildings, except in designated outdoor smoking areas. Philippine public health campaigners have long battled the hefty tobacco lobby and welcomed Duterte’s push to end smoking in public. There are about 17 million Filipino smokers, or nearly a third of the adult population, a 2014 report by the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance shows. Nearly half of all Filipino men and 9 percent of women smoke and experts say the habit costs the economy nearly $4 billion in annual healthcare and productivity losses. Marlboro owner Philip Morris International, which is estimated to hold more than seven-tenths of the Philippines market through its Fortune Tobacco joint venture, will be among the international producers most affected. In 2015, the Philippines accounted for almost one in every 13 cigarettes sold by Philip Morris globally, though analysts estimated that was worth about 2 percent of profit.

178,PM,British American Tobacco to expand 'glo' smokeless tobacco sales in Japan from July,"TOKYO (Reuters) - British American Tobacco will expand sales of its “glo” tobacco-heating device to Tokyo and Osaka from July and roll it out nationwide by year-end, intensifying a battle with Philip Morris International for a share of Japan’s vaping market.  Big tobacco firms are investing in alternative products as more people give up traditional cigarettes amid health concerns. Japan has emerged as a popular testing ground, mainly for “heat not burn” tobacco devices, given e-cigarettes using nicotine-laced liquid are not permitted under the country’s regulations. In fact, both glo and Philip Morris’ vaping device “iQOS” were launched in Japan and have limited sales outside. Glo has been on sale in the northeastern city of Sendai since December and iQOS was rolled out across the country in April 2016. According to their manufacturers, the products have been so popular in Japan that supply has fallen short. British American Tobacco, known for Kent and Lucky Strike cigarettes, will start selling glo in the western Japanese city of Osaka, Miyagi in the country’s northeast and Tokyo from July 3, its Japan President Roberta Palazzetti said.  “Our ambition is to be a leader in next generation-products in Japan,” Palazzetti said at a news conference on Tuesday. Glo, like iQOS, uses tobacco packed in replaceable sticks. Instead of burning, the battery-powered devices heat the sticks to generate vapor, which their makers say emit less harmful chemicals than conventional cigarettes.     Marlboro-maker Philip Morris estimates that HeatSticks, used in iQOS, had already cornered a 10 percent share of the Japanese market as of April, up from 7.6 percent in January.  Apart from Japan, iQOS is available in at least 19 other markets. Glo went on sale in Switzerland and Canada earlier this year. The latest version of iQOS is priced at 10,980 yen ($99), while glo is priced at 8,000 yen. Japan Tobacco Inc’s vaping product “Ploom TECH”, which is set to be sold in Tokyo from June 29, costs 4,000 yen.   The former state monopoly, which commands 60 percent of Japan’s cigarette market, has been lagging in the new product category, but says it is aiming to grab the top share of the country’s vaping market in three years.

181,PM,Japan Tobacco tries to catch up with rival in smokeless tobacco,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) said on Wednesday it hoped to catch up with Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) in smokeless tobacco by expanding the number of smoke-free restaurants and public places that allow its vaping product.   Tobacco firms see Japan as a test ground for vaping products, as e-cigarettes using nicotine-laced liquid are not allowed under the country’s pharmaceutical regulations. While Marlboro maker Philip Morris’s heat-not-burn “IQOS” tobacco device is already enjoying strong demand in Japan, Japan Tobacco’s launch of its “Ploom Tech” product has run into delays due to production shortages. Japan Tobacco, a former state monopoly still a third owned by the government, will start selling Ploom Tech at its flagship shops on Thursday and 100 tobacco stores on July 10 in Tokyo. The company has said it plans to sell it nationwide in the first half of the next year. The company test-launched the product in southwestern city of Fukuoka in March last year and at its online shop. It had to temporarily suspend sales after demand overwhelmed supply. Japan Tobacco said it had sold 250,000 Ploom Tech devices by the end of last year.  Unlike Philip Morris’s IQOS, Ploom Tech does not directly heat tobacco leaves. Instead, the battery-powered device generates vapor that goes through a capsule packed with tobacco leaves.  Japan Tobacco said the mechanism produces less smell than “heat-not-burn” products, and the company hopes it will be a strong differentiating factor against rivals. It said Ploom Tech emits smell a five-hundredth of a conventional cigarette.  The company said about 80 smoke-free restaurants, cafes and other public places in Fukuoka allow the use of Ploom Tech. In Tokyo, there are about 120 such facilities, it said.  “The number of smoke-free places that allow Ploom Tech is increasing,” Chito Sasaki, president of the company’s Japanese tobacco business, told reporters.

That compares with about 15-20 percent of people who use e-cigarettes, he said.  “It’s unprecedented,” Nixon told the Today show. “We’re very encouraged that products like iQOS are the absolute game changer.” Whereas e-cigarettes use nicotine-laced liquid, IQOS heats tobacco sticks, called Heets, to a high enough temperature to create a vapor but not smoke.  Philip Morris, which has Marlboro cigarettes among its global brands, has applied to U.S. health regulators to have iQOS recognized as having “modified risk” compared with cigarettes.  The relative health benefit of these products was questioned in a study last month, which found that they release chemicals linked to cancer, sometimes in higher concentrations than conventional cigarettes.        British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco are also selling tobacco-based “vaping” devices, but so far Philip Morris is in the lead.  The company sells about 7 billion Heets a year, which is tiny compared with the 820 billion conventional cigarettes it sells. But Nixon told the BBC that the company hopes to produce 100 billion Heets next year, up from less than 400 million in 2015. “One day we want to stop selling cigarettes,” Nixon said on the program. “We’re moving very fast.” There are still 7.5 million smokers in Britain, Nixon said, and Philip Morris has hired “freelancers” to help to bring that number down. These freelancers act like quitting coaches and can earn 50 pounds ($64.95) from Philip Morris for every person they convert from cigarettes to iQOS. “With these types of programs we can get that down to almost zero in coming years,” Nixon said.

185,PM,Exclusive: Documents reveal Philip Morris' campaign to subvert the world's anti-smoking treaty,"NEW DELHI/LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) is waging a secret campaign to subvert the World Health Organization’s anti-smoking treaty, which was designed to save lives by curbing tobacco use, a Reuters investigation published today reveals. In one of the largest-ever tobacco industry leaks, internal Philip Morris International documents seen by Reuters, combined with reporting in 14 countries, expose a clandestine lobbying operation that stretches from the Americas to Africa to Asia. In internal emails, Philip Morris executives take credit for the watering down of anti-smoking measures at the biennial meeting of the tobacco control treaty, known as the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, or FCTC. The thousands of pages of documents reviewed by Reuters also include Philip Morris plans to set up a “global project team” for “achieving scrutiny” of tobacco control advocates. The full story – along with a selection of internal Philip Morris documents uncovered by Reuters – can be read online. (reut.rs/2sSSnyQ) Philip Morris International, which sells Marlboro and other cigarettes outside the United States, says there is nothing improper about its executives engaging with government officials. “As a company in a highly regulated industry, speaking with governments is part of our everyday business,” said Tony Snyder, vice president of communications for Philip Morris International. “The fact that Reuters has seen internal emails discussing our engagement with governments does not make those interactions inappropriate.” Philip Morris, which like other tobacco companies isn’t invited to the biennial treaty meetings, runs covert operations centers in the cities hosting the treaty meetings. During these gatherings, the company’s executives meet secretly with delegates from member nations that are party to the treaty. Some 90 percent of the world’s nations are members of the FCTC. Since the treaty came into force in 2005, it has persuaded dozens of nations to boost taxes on tobacco products, pass laws banning smoking in public places and increase the size of health warnings on cigarette packs. Because of the treaty, an estimated 22 million smoking-related deaths will be averted, according to a study by researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center. For Philip Morris, the treaty is a “regulatory runaway train” driven by “anti-tobacco extremists,” according to a description contained in a 2014 internal PowerPoint presentation. While the company targets the biennial treaty conferences where new tobacco control measures are negotiated, it also intervenes at the country level where treaty delegates are picked and tobacco control laws are enacted. One of Philip Morris’ goals has been to boost the presence of delegates in the national treaty delegations who are not from health agencies. That has happened, according to a Reuters analysis of delegation rosters. Delegations to the treaty now include more representatives of ministries linked to tax, finance or agriculture interests who may put revenues from tobacco over health concerns. The number of those delegates has risen from a few dozen in 2006 to more than 100 in recent years. The internal company documents detail efforts to stymie the anti-smoking treaty that span years and include dozens of employees. After the end of the FCTC conference in Moscow in 2014, Philip Morris executives congratulated themselves on weakening new anti-smoking proposals, including ones related to international trade, tobacco farming and tobacco company liability, internal emails show.

186,PM,"Special Report: Philip Morris takes aim at young people in India, and health officials are fuming","NEW DELHI (Reuters) - S. K. Arora spent more than three years trudging through the Indian summer heat and monsoon rains to inspect tobacco kiosks across this sprawling megacity, tearing down cigarette advertisements and handing out fines to store owners for putting them up. But as fast as he removed the colorful ads, more appeared. The chief tobacco control officer at the Delhi state government, Arora asked the major cigarette companies to put a stop to the cat-and-mouse routine. In official letters and face-to-face meetings, he told them India’s tobacco control laws barred such public advertising and promotion of cigarettes. That included the Indian arm of Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N), the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company. Early last year, Arora said, he met with a Philip Morris director for corporate affairs in India, a man named R. Venkatesh, and told him the signs were an unequivocal violation of Indian law. Like other tobacco companies, Philip Morris kept up its ad blitz. Venkatesh says Philip Morris is doing nothing wrong. In response to questions from Reuters, he said the company’s advertising is “compliant with Indian law” and that Philip Morris has “fully cooperated with the enforcement authorities” on the matter. But Indian government officials say Philip Morris is using methods that flout the nation’s tobacco-control regulations. These include tobacco shop displays as well as the free distribution of Marlboro – the world’s best-selling cigarette brand – at nightclubs and bars frequented by young people. (See the web version of this story - reut.rs/2uuye5Y) In internal documents, Philip Morris International is explicit about targeting the country’s youth. A key goal is “winning the hearts and minds of LA-24,” those between legal age, 18, and 24, according to one slide in a 2015 commercial review presentation. As with the point-of-sale ads at kiosks, public health officials say that giving away cigarettes is a violation of India’s Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act and its accompanying rules. Philip Morris' marketing strategy for India, which relies heavily on kiosk advertising and social events, is laid out in hundreds of pages of internal documents reviewed by Reuters that cover the period from 2009 to 2016. In them, Philip Morris presents these promotions as key marketing activities. In recent years, they have helped to more than quadruple Marlboro's market share in India, where the company is battling to expand its reach in the face of an entrenched local giant. Reuters is publishing a selection of those documents in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files. (reut.rs/2sT51xF) The company’s goal is to make sure that “every adult Indian smoker should be able to buy Marlboro within walking distance,” according to another 2015 strategy document. In targeting young adults, Philip Morris is deploying a promotional strategy that it and other tobacco companies used in the United States decades ago. A study published in the American Journal of Public Health in 2002 found that during the 1990s, “tobacco industry sponsorship of bars and nightclubs increased dramatically, accompanied by cigarette brand paraphernalia, advertisements, and entertainment events in bars and clubs.” With cigarette sales declining in many countries, Philip Morris has identified India, population 1.3 billion, as a market with opportunity for significant growth. “India remains a high potential market with huge upside with cigarette market still in infancy,” says a 2014 internal document. According to government data, India has about 100 million smokers. Of those, about two-thirds smoke traditional hand-rolled cigarettes. Tobacco use kills more than 900,000 people a year in India, and the World Health Organization estimates that tobacco-related diseases cost the country about $16 billion annually. Philip Morris is not alone in using marketing methods that Indian officials say are illegal. The country’s largest cigarette maker, ITC Ltd (ITC.NS), uses similar tactics, such as advertising at kiosks. British American Tobacco Plc (BATS.L) and Indian state-run companies have large, passive stakes in ITC, which controls about 80 percent of the market. Tobacco-control officer Arora, a short, mustachioed man with a gruff demeanor, sent a letter to Philip Morris and other tobacco companies in mid-April, giving them until the end of the month to remove all advertisements. “Legal action will be initiated against the company” if it did not comply, he wrote in the letters, copies of which were reviewed by Reuters. A day after Arora’s deadline passed, he and his team conducted a raid in an affluent area of cafes and coffee shops in New Delhi that showed his letters did not have the desired effect. On that hot afternoon in May, the team cut down about a dozen advertisements for Marlboro and various ITC brands. As word of the raid spread, worried vendors covered their ads with newspapers or took them down. One kiosk owner, Rakesh Kumar Jain, removed his Marlboro ads before Arora’s team arrived. Jain said the signs had been put up by Philip Morris representatives. In return, he said, he received free cigarettes each month worth about 2,000 rupees (about $30). Jain knew that putting up the posters was illegal, but they helped improve sales, he said. About a dozen kiosk owners interviewed by Reuters said that tobacco companies paid them a monthly fee for advertisements and product displays, with the amount determined by factors such as location, volume of business and type of promotional material. In payment receipts seen by Reuters, Philip Morris’ India unit promised to pay 500 Indian rupees ($7.50) a month to a cigarette seller with a small roadside kiosk in New Delhi for putting up Marlboro ads. The receipts were signed by a company representative. During the raid, fines were issued to some vendors, many of them repeat offenders, and they were threatened with court action if the ads went up again. Like Philip Morris, ITC says that it is in full compliance with India’s 2003 tobacco control law. If it wasn’t, the company said in a statement to Reuters, then “the relevant government authorities would have initiated action.” Since Arora’s threat of legal action in April, there are fewer Philip Morris advertisements outside cigarette shops in the capital. But both Philip Morris and ITC say that advertising inside a shop is allowed. “Advertisements of tobacco products at the entrance and inside the shops selling tobacco products are clearly and categorically permitted,” ITC said in response to questions from Reuters. Arora, however, said all advertising is prohibited - “There are no two ways about it,” he insisted - but he can’t start legal proceedings until getting further guidance from the federal government. He has yet to receive an answer. Federal health officials say in interviews that the ads are out of bounds. Amal Pusp, a director for tobacco control at the health ministry, told Reuters that “there is no confusion”: All advertisements - inside and outside shops - are illegal. The 2003 law allows tobacco companies to advertise at shops, but subsequent rules issued by the government prohibit it. In 2004, India became one of the first countries to ratify the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) treaty. The pact has 181 members and contains a raft of anti-smoking provisions, including tobacco taxes, warning labels on cigarette packs and advertising bans. The country enacted its national tobacco control law the year before ratifying the FCTC, and since then the government has added rules to strengthen the law in line with FCTC treaty provisions. The health ministry published rules in 2005 that banned any display of brand names, pack images or promotional messages. The rule specified that tobacco retailers could only display a 60-by-45 centimeter board, roughly 24 by 18 inches. The sign can have a description of the type of tobacco products sold – such as cigarettes or chewing tobacco – but cannot include any brand advertising and must carry a large health warning. The health ministry’s rules were challenged in court by a group of cigarette distributors and put on hold by a state-level High Court for seven years. They finally came into force in 2013 on orders of India’s Supreme Court. The High Court had overlooked the fact that advertisement of tobacco products “will attract younger generation and innocent minds, who are not aware of grave and adverse consequences of consuming such products,” the Supreme Court said in its ruling. Philip Morris has lobbied against the passing of stricter tobacco control rules by the Indian government. In documents detailing the company’s plans for the biennial FCTC treaty convention in India last November, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emerges as a prime target. A key goal: to pre-empt Modi from taking “extreme anti-tobacco measures” before delegates were to gather from around the world for the treaty meeting, according to a 2014 corporate affairs PowerPoint presentation. The company planned to gain Modi’s ear through those close to him. It identified several people in this group, including Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda, and Amit Shah, president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Modi and the other politicians didn’t respond to requests for comment. Philip Morris International also didn’t comment on the plan. The tobacco giant’s efforts to fend off anti-smoking steps have had limited impact so far. Last year, for instance, India ordered manufacturers to cover 85 percent of the surface of cigarette packs with health warnings, up from 20 percent. The rule, which is still being challenged in a state court by the tobacco industry, including Philip Morris’ India partner, was implemented by order of the Supreme Court. Marlboro has just a 1.4 percent share of the almost $10 billion cigarette market in India. The industry is dominated by ITC, which has a strong grip on distributors and retailers. One major method Philip Morris is deploying to gain ground, the marketing documents show, is the free distribution of cigarettes at bars and nightclubs - known as Legal Age Meeting Points, or LAMPs, in company jargon. The hiring of young women and men to work at these gatherings is outsourced to event management companies, according to people with knowledge of the gatherings. Some of the recruiting takes place online. “Hey girls…We are searching A++ Hot & Gorgeous girls for the Marlboro pub activity...Pay: 2000/day...Work: Promotion in clubs in Delhi,” read one post on a Facebook public group in June last year. There was no company name attached to the ad. At several parties attended by Reuters in Delhi and Mumbai, young women dressed in the colors of the latest Marlboro variant handed out packs of cigarettes. During one party at a nightclub in a Delhi hotel, a young woman walked around with a tablet showing an ad that highlighted Marlboro features. A television screen played a video promoting the brand: “For trendsetters, for forward thinkers, a smooth and balanced smoking experience.” In many ways, it was right out of the Philip Morris 1990s playbook. The American Journal of Public Health study, drawing on previously secret industry documents, found that Philip Morris ran bar promotions in 1990 using racing jackets, and added “neon message boards and cocktail trays” in 1991. The study described methods for collecting names for a company database “to generate smoker profiles, direct mailing campaigns, and conduct telephone research studies after the bar events.” At the parties in India, people who took the Marlboro packs were asked their names, ages and preferred brands. Philip Morris calls this distribution of free cigarettes “sampling,” which it says in an internal document is allowed under the law. The company has spent millions of dollars on these activities. In 2014, for example, Philip Morris estimated it spent $1.6 million on LAMP events and sampling at kiosks in India, according to the 2015 commercial review presentation. The company planned to use LAMPs in 2015 to generate 30,000 “trials,” or samplings of cigarettes. And it planned to generate another 500,000 trials that year through sampling at cigarette shops and kiosks, according to the 2015 strategy document. The company instructs employees to watch their words. An undated training manual for market researchers says: “Do not say this is a ‘PROMOTION’ or ‘ADVERTISING’.” Indian health ministry officials say that anyone who hands out free cigarettes, whatever the circumstances, is breaking the law. The Health Ministry’s Amal Pusp says the law against distribution of free cigarettes is unambiguous. He cites Section 5 of the country’s tobacco control act, which says: “No person, shall, under a contract or otherwise promote or agree to promote the use or consumption of” cigarettes or any other tobacco product. The law carries a fine of up to 1,000 rupees (about $15) and a sentence of up to two years in prison for a first conviction. “We believe we market our products in a responsible manner, and in compliance with Indian regulations,” Philip Morris’ Venkatesh said, without elaborating. In October last year, the month before India was due to host delegations from around the world at the biennial FCTC tobacco control conference in Delhi, tobacco-control officer Arora said he suddenly started getting traction. The cigarette ads vanished and Delhi was “cleaned,” he said. That success couldn’t have come at a better time for Arora and his colleagues at the federal health ministry: They wanted to make sure foreign delegates visiting India saw the country was serious about its tobacco regulations. Weeks after the FCTC delegates left town in November, however, kiosks in the capital were again displaying ads for Marlboro.

Philip Morris advertises Marlboro cigarettes, the world’s best-selling brand, at tobacco shops in India and distributes free smokes at nightclubs and bars frequented by young people to promote the brand, Reuters reported earlier this week. The strategy is laid out in hundreds of pages of internal documents reviewed by Reuters that cover the period from 2009 to 2016. (reut.rs/2uuye5Y)     Indian government officials previously have said these marketing activities violate the country’s Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act and its accompanying rules, but companies get away with it because enforcement is weak.      The government now plans to write letters to Philip Morris’ India unit as well as other tobacco companies and take “action as per law”, said Arun Kumar Jha, a federal health ministry official who oversees tobacco control in the country. Jha added that the ministry will also ask states to take action against advertisements that violate regulations.     “Our basic objective is to reduce deaths caused by tobacco,” Jha told Reuters.

190,PM,FDA move on nicotine could boost Philip Morris iQOS smoking device,"July 28 (Reuters) - A U.S. move to cut nicotine levels in traditional cigarettes could prove a boon to Philip Morris International Inc, which has invested heavily in a new smoking device that heats rather than burns tobacco and may carry fewer health risks, tobacco analysts said on Friday. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed cutting nicotine to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels in a major regulatory shift expected to move smokers toward e-cigarettes. Shares of major tobacco companies Altria Group and British American Tobacco slumped on concerns the FDA proposal will accelerate sales declines for traditional cigarettes. PMI, however, bounced back from an initial decline and closed up slightly in New York trading. The company filed late last year for FDA approval of its heat-not-burn product, iQOS. The product is a battery-powered tobacco stick that is heated just enough to produce an aerosol but not combust. Tobacco produces most of its toxic chemicals when burned. Switzerland-based PMI launched iQOS in Japan in 2014, where it has become so popular that it is often in short supply. The company has since rolled it out in multiple locations, including Italy, Switzerland and the UK. “We believe this could prove to be an opportunity over the long term for reduced-risk products and, therefore, Altria/(Philip Morris) as they have a unique competitive advantage with iQOS,” Bonnie Herzog, a tobacco industry analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, wrote of the FDA move. PMI, the world’s biggest international tobacco company, is not the only tobacco company to delve into alternative nicotine devices, but it is in the lead with a potentially less risky product. It has a partnership with Altria to market iQOS in the United States. The company was not immediately available for comment. On Tuesday, British American Tobacco completed its purchase of the 57.8 percent of Reynolds American that it did not already own in a deal seen as helpful to BAT’s e-cigarette aspirations. Reynolds makes the top-selling VUSE e-cigarette. BAT makes e-cigarettes under the Vype brand. Altria, which owns the e-cigarette company Nu Mark, and Fontem Ventures, a subsidiary of Imperial Brands Plc, are also leading e-cigarette makers. Japan Tobacco Inc plans to spend $500 million to quadruple its smokeless tobacco production capacity by the end of 2018 to challenge Philip Morris for vaping customers.

191,PM,"Japan Tobacco cuts cigarette outlook as smokers shift to ""heat-not-burn"" alternatives","TOKYO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco Inc on Wednesday lowered its domestic cigarette sales forecast for this year as it sees more smokers defecting to “heat-not-burn” (HNB) tobacco products dominated by global rival Philip Morris International Inc. The former state-monopoly said it is ramping up production of its Ploom Tech battery-powered smokeless tobacco product as it tries to catch with up Philip Morris’ IQOS and British American Tobacco PLC’s (BAT) recently released glo. “It’s a pity we fell behind when IQOS and glo appeared,” said Executive Vice President Hideki Miyazaki at an earnings briefing. Japan Tobacco, which commands 60 percent of the domestic cigarette market, is tackling the quick-growing popularity of IQOS and glo at a time when the number of smokers is shrinking in an era of increasing health awareness. It said it now expects to sell 93 billion cigarettes in Japan this year, down 12.4 percent from last year and 3 billion fewer than projected at the beginning of the business year that started in January. Miyazaki attributed two-thirds of the downward revision to the defection to Philip Morris’ and BAT’s HNB offerings, and one-third to a decline in cigarette demand. Japan has become a fertile market for HNB because its pharmaceutical regulations prohibit the use liquid laced with nicotine - the basis of e-cigarettes, the consumption of which is popularly known as vaping. In Japan, e-cigarettes use flavoured liquid. Japan accounted for about 96 percent of the $2.1 billion global sales of HNB products in 2016, showed data from Euromonitor International. The researcher forecasts global sales of such products to grow to $15.4 billion in 2021. In Japan, HNB made up just 3 percent of the total tobacco market in terms of shipment volume last year, but Mizuho Securities forecasts the products to reach 47 percent in 2021. Philip Morris started selling IQOS in Japan in 2014 and expanded nationwide in April last year. BAT gave its glo a limited release in the country in December, and plans to expand nationwide by the end of 2017. Japan Tobacco started selling its Ploom Tech in central Tokyo last month after production delays, and aims to expand nationwide in the first half of next year. Though Japan Tobacco expects a steeper decline in its domestic cigarette business than previously estimated, it raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 1 percent to 565 billion yen ($5.10 billion) as it sees favourable foreign exchange movement boosting profit from overseas business.

194,PM,India threatens Philip Morris with 'punitive action' over alleged violations,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government has threatened Philip Morris International Inc with “punitive action” over the tobacco giant’s alleged violation of the country’s anti-smoking laws, according to a letter sent to the company by the federal health ministry. The letter was prompted by a Reuters investigation last month that revealed how Philip Morris was deploying marketing tactics in India, some targeting young people, that officials said were illegal. (reut.rs/2uuye5Y) The letter cites the Reuters story in the opening paragraph, listing Philip Morris’ marketing methods as outlined in the article, including cigarette advertisements at kiosks, the free distribution of Marlboro smokes at nightclubs and bars, and the use of TV screens to promote the world’s best-selling cigarette brand at these events. These promotional activities are a violation of the country’s tobacco control law and are subject to punishment under the act, says the letter, dated Aug. 10. “You are requested to clarify your position and to show cause why appropriate punitive action be not initiated against the company and its directors,” the letter continues. Such infractions can carry a fine of up to 1,000 rupees  (about $15) and a sentence of up to two years in prison for the first conviction, according to the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act. The India unit of Philip Morris International did not respond to questions from Reuters. The health ministry also sent a letter to ITC Ltd, India’s leading cigarette maker, which Reuters also reported last month was using some of the same promotional methods as Philip Morris, such as point of sale displays. In its letter to ITC, the health ministry said the company’s advertisements at kiosks were illegal. “Advertisement other than listing type of tobacco products available, whether displayed inside or outside the shop is prohibited and attracts punishment,” the ministry said. It also called on ITC to explain why “punitive action” should not be taken against the company. ITC did not respond to questions. Indian officials have repeatedly said that tobacco advertisements that use brand names, pack images or promotional messages are banned at kiosks - inside and outside. Philip Morris and ITC have said they are in compliance with tobacco control regulations and that the law allows advertising inside a kiosk. Philip Morris' marketing strategy for India is laid out in hundreds of pages of internal documents that cover the period from 2009 to 2016. A key goal, according to the documents, is ""winning the hearts and minds of LA-24"" – people between legal age, 18, and 24. The documents can be viewed in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files, published by Reuters. (reut.rs/2sT51xF) The tobacco shop displays and the distribution of cigarettes at events attended by young people have helped to more than quadruple Marlboro’s market share in India, where Philip Morris is battling to win ground from ITC, which dominates the industry. India, with a population of 1.3 billion, has about 100 million smokers. Tobacco use kills more than 900,000 people a year, according to government data. Since October last year, the state government in India’s capital New Delhi has sent at least four letters to Philip Morris and at least three to ITC telling them to remove their advertisements at kiosks. Indian officials say tobacco companies get away with violations of anti-smoking regulations because law enforcement is weak. The health ministry also instructed state governments this month to move against cigarette advertising at kiosks, as well as the distribution of free cigarettes. The ministry requested that states submit a progress report on their actions. Following the Reuters story, Delhi state tobacco control chief S. K. Arora said he quizzed Philip Morris about the distribution of free cigarettes. In internal documents, Philip Morris calls distribution of free cigarettes “sampling” and says it is allowed under the law in India. The company has spent millions of dollars promoting its Marlboro brand at social events, the documents show. At several parties attended by Reuters reporters in Delhi over the past year, young women dressed in the colors of the latest Marlboro variant handed out free packs of cigarettes after asking people for their name, age and preferred brand. In recent weeks, Arora said he had detected a decline in the number of cigarette ads at kiosks in Delhi. Since the Reuters article last month, some Philip Morris ads have disappeared from several tobacco shops in Mumbai.

195,PM,CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Japan Tobacco to buy Philippine cigarette maker Mighty for $936 mln,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) said on Tuesday it would buy the Philippines’ No. 2 cigarette maker Mighty Corp for about $936 million, its second large deal in Southeast Asia this month as it deepens its push into emerging markets. The acquisition will help Japan Tobacco, which sells the Winston, Mevius and Camel brands in the Philippines, challenge the local dominance of PMFTC Inc, a venture owned by a Philip Morris International (PM.N) and unlisted Fortune Tobacco Corp. Facing a shrinking smoking population at home, the world’s fourth-biggest cigarette maker this month announced it would buy an Indonesian maker of “kretek” tobacco and clove cigarettes, together with its distributor, for $677 million. Including debt, the deal was valued at around $1 billion. Japan Tobacco has said it is also looking for acquisitions in Africa and Latin America. The latest deal will help Mighty Corp pay unpaid taxes in the Philippines. The company was charged with avoiding 37.88 billion pesos in taxes, and offered to pay 25 billion pesos with funds from the sale, the Philippines’ Department of Finance said in July.  The transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter after regulatory approvals, Japan Tobacco said in a statement.

196,PM,Philip Morris International CEO cheers U.S. FDA tobacco proposal,"(Reuters) - The chief executive of Philip Morris International said he was “extremely encouraged” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recent proposal to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes and nudge smokers toward less harmful alternatives such as e-cigarettes. The FDA’s announcement was “one of the best articulated positions in many years,” Andre Calantzopoulos, PMI’s chief executive, said in an interview on Monday. It was the first time a major tobacco executive has spoken in depth about the agency’s proposal.  PMI has invested billions of dollars in electronic cigarettes and other alternative nicotine delivery devices, including products that heat rather than burn tobacco. Most of the toxic chemicals in cigarettes are produced by combustion. The FDA’s proposal to regulate the amount of nicotine in cigarettes to minimally or non-addictive levels surprised many tobacco control experts, and sent tobacco company shares tumbling. PMI’s shares were spared, in part because investors are optimistic about the company’s heat-not-burn product, called IQOS. Calantzopoulos challenged the view of some tobacco control experts that the industry will fight the FDA’s proposal, in court if needed. He pointed out that lowering nicotine levels is only one part of the proposed policy. The agency also took action to make life easier for e-cigarette manufacturers. “I don’t think the issue requires litigation or anything of this nature,” Calantzopoulos said. “It requires dialogue in order to see what the feasibility is, and most importantly, how all these measures are phased in.” The FDA proposal will require a concerted effort between the regulator and manufacturers of alternative nicotine products, he said. “If people understand that this is not an isolated measure but something that is part of a comprehensive policy, I think we can find a solution.” PMI has a number of alternative products in development. IQOS was introduced in late 2014 and has taken off in Japan. It is currently under review by the FDA. Calantzopoulos said 3 million people have switched to IQOS from regular cigarettes and 8,000 more are switching every day. Moreover, between 65 and 75 percent of those people switch completely, a far higher number than switch completely to e-cigarettes. Calantzopoulos believes heat-not-burn products initially have a higher potential to appeal to smokers than e-cigarettes because they more closely mimic the taste of cigarettes. But as e-cigarette technology improves, they too will play an important role in getting smokers to switch, he said. PMI, which makes Marlboro cigarettes outside the United States, is the second-largest international tobacco company, with global sales last year of $74.9 billion. It is not ready to give up those sales any time soon. But Calantzopoulos said his company’s investment focus, including sales and marketing, “is squarely in our reduced risk product portfolio, and this is going to be increasingly so.” If global regulators follow the lead of the FDA, some countries, such as Japan, could quit cigarettes altogether within 10 to 15 years, he said. Other countries, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, could take longer. PMI was spun off from Altria Group Inc nearly a decade ago, and Altria will commercialize IQOS in the United States. Some have speculated the two might get back together. Calantzopoulos dismissed the idea. “There is no such plan,” he said. “We have a very satisfactory relationship with them but I don’t see the reasons that drove the separation reversing.” ",8222017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-pmi-ceo-interview/philip-morris-international-ceo-cheers-u-s-fda-tobacco-proposal-idUSKCN1B20A0

198,PM,UPDATE 2-BAT restructures to help e-cigarettes go mainstream,"(Reuters) - British American Tobacco (BATS.L) has reorganized its regional management structure to integrate its vaping products with its core business, in a push by the world’s biggest listed tobacco company to help cigarette alternatives go mainstream.     The move, announced on Thursday, follows the company’s $49 billion takeover of U.S. peer Reynolds American, which added Camel cigarettes and Vuse e-cigarettes to a BAT portfolio that includes Lucky Strike cigarettes, Vype e-cigarettes and the glo tobacco-heating device.      “Now that we have built a successful NGP (next generation products) business which is poised for substantial growth, we will be fully integrating NGP to leverage the scale and expertise of the whole group to drive growth in an area that is fast becoming a key part of our mainstream business,” BAT said in a statement.  BAT wants to double the number of countries where it sells vaping products this year and again in 2018, as it jostles for position in a growing market against rivals Philip Morris International (PM.N) and Imperial Brands (IMB.L).   BAT and Philip Morris were the first of the big tobacco firms to invest in cigarette alternatives a few year back, as growing health consciousness reduces traditional smoking. Philip Morris, maker of Marlboro cigarettes, is ahead of BAT in the market for tobacco-based vaping devices, which some analysts believe will be more popular than traditional e-cigarettes with regular smokers, and its shares have been at a bigger premium to its peers. (bit.ly/2xOLU9R) Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed cutting nicotine in cigarettes to “non-addictive” levels in a push to move smokers toward potentially less harmful e-cigarettes. Under the management reorganization announced on Thursday BAT appointed Asia-Pacific Director Jack Bowles to the newly created role of chief operating officer for the international business, excluding the United States. Shares were up around 1.5 percent at 1322 GMT on Thursday. Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett said the changes could add some uncertainty for BAT in the near term, but in the longer term it reinforced the importance of cigarette alternatives to tobacco companies, which face slowing sales globally. “Whereas those companies that were better positioned for emerging market growth in the past were favoured, the key differentiator now is likely to be who is positioned best in emerging products, given the recent slowdown in emerging market cigarettes,” the analyst said.  Japan Tobacco said last week it would buy the Philippines’ No. 2 cigarette maker Mighty Corp for about $936 million, its second large deal in Southeast Asia this month, as it deepens its push into emerging markets.

199,PM,Motor racing: Ferrari continue with tobacco sponsor,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Ferrari Formula One team and tobacco company Philip Morris International announced on Monday the renewal of one of the longest-running and least obvious sponsorships in sport. A Ferrari statement gave no details about the amount or time frame of the deal. The partnership has been running for more than 40 years, surviving a ban on visible cigarette advertising that led other teams to kick the lucrative habit and look for revenues elsewhere. Philip Morris’s Marlboro brand was last seen on Ferrari’s grand prix cars in 2007. The team race in a predominantly red and white livery, the same as Marlboro’s traditional branding although the Italian sportscar manufacturer has always been associated with the color red. Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene previously worked for Philip Morris International while Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne is on the tobacco company’s board of directors. The European Union’s health commissioner asked Ferrari back in 2007 to end tobacco sponsorship of the team, saying it undermined the goal to end cigarette advertising at sporting events. In 2010 a “bar code” livery was removed from the Ferrari cars after complaints that it represented subliminal advertising for Marlboro. Ferrari said it did so to end speculation and had  never intended the code to be associated with the brand. “It is verging on the ridiculous to claim that the color red or a graphic design which shows a bar code could induce people to smoke,” former Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo said at the time.

205,PM,UPDATE 1-WHO tells govts to reject Philip Morris-funded smoking foundation,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization told governments on Thursday not to get involved in a foundation funded by tobacco firm Philip Morris International to look at ways of reducing the harm from smoking. The U.N. health body said there was a conflict of interest in a tobacco firm funding such research - drawing a sharp rebuke from the Foundation’s head who said his work was independent. Philip Morris International said this month it wanted to help set up a body called the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World and planned to give it about $80 million a year for 12 years to keep it running. The company did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the WHO’s statement. The U.N. body said on Thursday there were already proven techniques to tackle smoking - including tobacco taxes, graphic warning labels and advertising bans - which the tobacco industry had opposed in the past. “WHO will not partner with the Foundation. Governments should not partner with the Foundation and the public health community should follow this lead,” it said. The foundation’s founder and president-designate, Derek Yach, a former senior official at the WHO, said more collaboration, not less, was needed to win the war on smoking. “I am deeply disappointed, therefore, by WHO’s complete mischaracterisation of the nature, structure and intent of the Foundation in its recent statements - and especially by its admonition to others not to work together.” He said the foundation was a non-profit organization with strict rules to insulate it from the influence of the tobacco industry, and its research agenda would be subject to peer review.

208,PM,Fitch Affirms Philip Morris International at 'A'; Outlook Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, October 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed US-based tobacco group Philip Morris International, Inc's (PMI) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and Senior Unsecured Long-Term Rating at 'A'. PMI's Short-Term IDR and Short-Term Debt Rating are affirmed at 'F1'. The Outlook remains Negative. The Negative Outlook reflects the risk of a downgrade in the absence of reforms to the current US tax system. This system leads PMI to build up offshore cash balances and carry increasing leverage. Also, PMI's profile is shifting from a business characterised by predictable cash flow generation to one with an increasing investment and development component. While PMI's new Reduced Risk Products (RRP) are showing promising performance and the related investments should proceed at a measured pace, we project more limited post-dividend Free Cash Flow (FCF) than historically. We believe this should be counterbalanced by a return of leverage within the parameters consistent with the current 'A' IDR. However, we project that the current investment phase for RRPs, combined with the build-up of cash, will cause leverage to remain elevated until at least 2019. Given the increasing chances of a tax reform in the US, this may lead PMI to change its capital structure; in which case, Fitch could affirm PMI's IDR at 'A' and revise the Outlook to Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS ""IQOS"" Potential Game Changer: During 2017, PMI's ""IQOS"" - a Reduced Risk Product that offers smokers a smoke-free alternative that heats tobacco but does not burn it - reached relevant levels of contribution to PMI's revenues (9.8% in 9M17). PMI is enjoying a first mover advantage, particularly in Western Europe and Japan. Fitch believes this product, which by utilising tobacco is the closest possible electronic variant to a traditional cigarette, will grow to represent an increasingly material portion of PMI's revenues and profits. Also, we believe that consumers and regulators view it as healthier option compared to combustible cigarettes. Currently, per-unit profitability for PMI benefits from pricing at comparable levels to Marlboro, but excise duty is lower. Constrained Cash Flow Generation: Since 2014, as a result of currency headwinds and more intense R&D; and capex efforts in connection to its RRPs, PMI's operating profit and FCF have reduced from their peak levels of 2012-2013. The EBITDA margin shrunk by almost 400bp between 2013 and 2016 to 43.3% and the FCF margin dropped to around 2% of revenues. Fitch expects FCF (post-dividend) to be broadly neutral in 2017 and remain between 2% to 3.5% in 2018-2019. The recovery of FCF in the outer years of our projections is dependent on a larger scale success of PMI's RRP operations. FCF could however be constrained by further investments, in the event PMI decides to maintain the steady roll-out pace of the product. Shareholder Distribution Revisited: PMI has historically distributed to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks more than the FCF it generated. Fitch views positively the suspension of PMI's share buyback since 2015, which was followed by a slowdown in the pace of increased dividends since 2014. This indicates a willingness to protect the company's credit metrics and prioritise the allocation of cash flow towards investing to grow the RRP business. Unremitted Foreign Earnings (UFE): PMI continues to face a mismatch between the location of its earnings and debt, given that it does not have any sales in the US, while debt is raised at the holding company domiciled in the US. PMI regularly repatriates the majority of its foreign earnings. Its cash balances - which are fully abroad - represent the portion of profit that it does not repatriate. We calculate net debt by treating 35% of PMI's cash as restricted (USD1.5 billion for 2016), assuming it would be subject to an up to 35% tax deduction in case of repatriation. We currently expect FFO adjusted net leverage trending below 3.0x by 2018. Potential Tax Reform Benefits: In the absence of a reform of the US tax system towards a territorial principle, we envisage that PMI would increasingly accumulate more cash balances (up to USD12 billion in 2019 in our forecasts) and correspondingly continue to raise debt to fund the payment of dividends. Conversely, should PMI be able to repatriate those cash balances without an extra tax deduction, we estimate a faster pace of de-leveraging, with a benefit of between 0.3x and 0.5x lower leverage respectively in 2018 and 2020, compared to our rating case projections. Given that PMI already repatriates a majority of its profits, we believe a reduction of the US corporate tax rate would also likely provide some benefits to PMI's tax bill. Regulatory Changes Manageable: Fitch views the impact of smoking bans, cabinet display bans and graphic health warnings on consumption, including the revised European Union Trade Product Directive, as broadly manageable. Following its introduction in Australia since 2012, France and the UK fully implemented plain packaging in their markets respectively in January and May 2017. We believe that while plain packaging erodes the pricing power for more premium brands and in the longer-term could contribute to reducing the number of new smokers, the medium-term effect on tobacco companies is manageable, due to their geographic diversification and the limited spreading of this regulation. Leading Industry Player: The ratings continue to reflect the leading position of PMI in the international tobacco industry (excluding the US and China), supported by the diversity of its portfolio of brands and the countries in which it operates. It enjoys large market shares and pricing leadership in many of the most profitable and growing tobacco markets, with superior diversification across continents. All these factors remain consistent with PMI's 'A' IDR in relation to other sector peers and partly compensate for the elevated leverage which would, in isolation, lead to a lower rating. DERIVATION SUMMARY PMI is the highest rated issuer in the tobacco industry, reflecting its position as the largest international player, followed by British American Tobacco (BAT, BBB/Stable), its price leadership, strong profitability and geographic diversification. PMI benefits from comparable scale as BAT (post Reynolds acquisition) and is ahead of Imperial Brands PLC (BBB/Stable). PMI is rated one notch higher than Altria (A-/Stable) which only operates in the US, but has lower leverage. However, should PMI's leverage not reduce by 2018, its rating would be downgraded to the same level as Altria. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - mid to high single-digit sales growth and slight increase in profitability from 2018 onwards, thanks to constantly growing RRP contribution to sales and profit. - slightly negative FCF generation in 2017, with FCF margin at 2-3% from 2018 onwards. - no share buybacks between 2017 and 2019. - sizeable capex of USD1.5 billion - USD1.7 billion per annum to support RRPs. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch does not currently expect management to pursue financial policies that would be commensurate with an upgrade. However future developments that could lead to a revision of the Outlook to Stable include: - PMI's RRPs maintaining good momentum and supporting positive, at least low, single digit annual organic growth for PMI as a group; - Change in financial policy or in US tax system allowing FFO adjusted gross leverage trending below 3.0x (2016: 3.4x) and FFO adjusted net leverage trending below 2.5x (2016: 3.1x); - FCF margin on track to recover towards a level sustainably above 3% (2016: 2.0%); and - FFO fixed charge coverage sustainably above 6.0x (2016: 7.5x). Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action include: - Persistently weak performance with low or negative organic growth and worse than expected progress of RRPs revenue and profitability, preventing operating EBITDA from growing at least at low single digits; - FCF failing to return to at least 2% of revenues by 2018; - inability to deliver a stable to decreasing adjusted net debt (net of Fitch-defined restricted cash) leading to FFO-adjusted gross leverage remaining above 3.0x and FFO-adjusted net leverage above 2.5x by 2019; and - FFO fixed charge coverage below 6.0x. LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: at year-end 2016, PMI's gross debt of USD29.1 billion was well spread out, with no more than USD3 billion of bonds maturing in a given year.

209,PM,UPDATE 1-Japan Tobacco's new CEO lights up Imperial with M&A; talk,"TOKYO/LONDON (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) sparked takeover speculation on Tuesday by naming a new chief executive who wants the world’s third-largest international tobacco maker to do more overseas acquisitions to offset falling cigarette sales at home. Shares in British tobacco company Imperial Brands (IMB.L), long seen as a likely target, rose as much as 4 percent after Masamichi Terabatake, the CEO-designate, told reporters: “If there are good deals, we would like to actively pursue them”. Terabatake, who has a background in deal-making, said after his promotion was announced that he was willing to take risks, adding that the scale of acquisitions “does not matter”. Two big issues facing Japan Tobacco are a geographic footprint too concentrated in low-growth markets Japan and Europe and competitive weakness in vaping. Buying Imperial would help both issues, analysts at Jefferies have long argued.   Terabatake, who will replace Mitsuomi Koizumi in January, is currently deputy CEO at JT International, the Geneva-based headquarters of the company’s overseas operations, where he has spent more than a decade. The 51-year-old, who worked on Japan Tobacco’s $7.8 billion purchase of RJR Nabisco’s non-US tobacco business in 1999, did not give any details of possible targets but said: “There are still many regions we have not entered. There are many markets left for cigarette business to grow.”  Consolidation is widely expected in a global tobacco market that is shrinking as more people quit. British American Tobacco’s (BATS.L) July purchase of Reynolds American ignited expectations that a takeover of Imperial or Altria (MO.N) could follow, as Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris International (PM.N) seek to bolster their position against a newly enlarged rival.  Imperial’s shares had fallen 23 percent since April on concerns about its competitive position and lack of a vaping device that heats tobacco without burning it. It was trading at less than 12 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), whereas BAT, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco are at between 15 and 20 times EBITDA. That discount, and Japan Tobacco’s troubles, have some sources seeing a deal as more likely, though huge market overlap, such as in Britain, makes a takeover complicated.  Sources have suggested that Japan Tobacco and British American could split up Imperial, but warn that BAT may still be digesting its $49 billion purchase of Reynolds. A spokesman for Imperial, the maker of the Davidoff and Golden Virginia brands, declined to comment  Japan Tobacco’s domestic cigarette sales have been hurt by more smokers quitting than expected and the popularity of heat-not-burn (HNB) tobacco vaping devices.  It has forecast 92 billion cigarette sales in Japan for 2017, down 13.4 percent from a year ago. That would be 1 billion less than what it had projected in August and 4 billion below an estimate given at the start of year.  Despite commanding more than 60 percent of Japan’s cigarette market, the former state monopoly has ceded some of its home turf to Philip Morris, which launched its IQOS HNB product in Japan in 2014 and expanded nationwide in April last year. Japan Tobacco rolled out its Ploom Tech smokeless tobacco product in central Tokyo in July after production delays.  Terabatake said it was still too early for any company to solidify its lead in this category.  “(The) tobacco vapour war has just begun,” he said.

210,PM,Japan Tobacco to actively pursue M&A; opportunities -CEO designate,"TOKYO, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco Inc will seek acquisition opportunities overseas, said Masamichi Terabatake who is slated to become its CEO in January, to secure growth as the rise of vaping rivals snuffs out the company’s cigarette sales at home. “If there are good deals, we would like to actively pursue them, even by taking risks. The scale does not matter,” Terabatake told reporters on Tuesday, after his promotion to the CEO position was announced. Shares of Imperial Brands, which many see as a potential acquisition target for Japan Tobacco, rose 3.4 percent following Terabatake’s comments. “We would argue a bid for Imperial becomes more feasible under the new leadership with the new CEO saying JT is actively seeking M&A; opportunities ‘regardless of size’,” Jefferies analyst Owen Bennett wrote in a note to clients. Officials at Imperial, the maker of the Davidoff and Golden Virginia brands, declined to comment. Terabatake did not give any details on M&A; targets. The 51-year-old executive, who will replace Mitsuomi Koizumi as CEO, is currently deputy CEO at JT International, a Geneva-based company that is headquarters for Japan Tobacco’s overseas operations. Terabatake has spent more than a decade in the company’s international tobacco business. As a young official, he worked on Japan Tobacco’s $7.8 billion acquisition of the non-U.S. tobacco business of RJR Nabisco Inc in 1999. “There are still many regions we have not entered. There are many markets left for cigarette business to grow,” he said. At home, the company’s cigarette sales have been hit with more smokers quitting than expected and the negative impact of heat-not-burn (HNB) cigarette alternatives. It has forecast 92 billion cigarette sales in Japan for 2017, down 13.4 percent from a year ago. That would be 1 billion less than what it had projected in August and 4 billion below an estimate given at the start of year. Despite commanding over 60 percent of Japan’s cigarette market, the former state monopoly has been caught on the wrong side of the rising HNB popularity and has lagged in its own backyard versus global rival Philip Morris International. Quick to see that the number of smokers was shrinking in an era of increasing health awareness, Philip Morris started selling its IQOS HNB product, a tobacco vaping device, in Japan in 2014 and expanded nationwide in April last year. But Japan Tobacco rolled out its Ploom Tech battery-powered smokeless tobacco product in central Tokyo only in July this year after production delays. Terabatake said it was still too early for any company to solidify its lead in this category. “Tobacco vapour war has just begun,” he said.

212,PM,Special Report: Scientists describe problems in Philip Morris e-cigarette experiments,"By Tom Lasseter, Paritosh Bansal, Thomas Wilson, Ami Miyazaki Duff Wilson and Aditya Kalra TOKYO/NEUCHATEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is weighing whether to approve a potentially path-breaking smoking device by Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N). With a decision expected next year, former employees and contractors have described to Reuters a number of irregularities involving clinical trials that underpin the tobacco giant’s application to the agency. By heating tobacco instead of burning it, the company says the device, known as iQOS, avoids subjecting smokers to the same levels of carcinogens and other toxic substances found in a regular cigarette. The company has spent more than $3 billion developing new smoking platforms like iQOS. As part of that initiative, Philip Morris has published extensive scientific findings, based in part on clinical studies. Tamara Koval, who worked at the company from 2012 to 2014 and helped coordinate clinical trials for the device, questioned the quality of some of the researchers and sites contracted to carry out those experiments. Koval was a co-author of the company’s protocol used to run the studies globally. When she highlighted an irregularity in one of the studies, Koval said, Philip Morris excluded her from meetings. Reuters also found irregularities during interviews with some of the principal investigators contracted to conduct the trials for the company. One principal investigator said he knew nothing about tobacco. Philip Morris had to jettison the experiment that investigator performed after it emerged he hadn’t followed a basic procedure for obtaining informed consent from participants during clinical trials. A second investigator submitted urine samples that exceeded what a human being is capable of, according to two former company employees, and then initially refused to acknowledge there was a problem. A third said he doesn’t hold such company-sponsored clinical trials in high regard, describing them as “dirty” because their purpose is more commercial than scientific. After reviewing Reuters’ findings, Philip Morris said in a statement that “all studies were conducted by suitably qualified and trained Principal Investigators.” The company said it understands that “FDA inspectors have already audited some facilities” involved in the trials. Philip Morris also said it had taken steps to address “any reported irregularity in our studies.” “Our policies encourage speaking up about suspected violations of law or our policies and we do not tolerate retaliation against those who speak up,” the company said. In addition to former Philip Morris employees involved with the iQOS program, Reuters interviewed six of the 11 principal investigators who were responsible for five of eight clinical trials the company submitted to the FDA. Reuters also reviewed hundreds of pages of publicly available Philip Morris study reports and FDA filings. That reporting identified shortcomings in the training and professionalism of some of the lead investigators, as well as their knowledge of the study results. A group of tobacco research and policy experts reviewed detailed summaries of Reuters’ reporting and Philip Morris’ response. The experts, including a former head of the FDA and two former scientific advisers for the agency, said those findings raise concerns about Philip Morris’ clinical trial program. “Taken as a whole, it’s clear they do not have the sophistication to carry out adequate and well-controlled clinical trials,” said David Kessler, the FDA’s commissioner from 1990 to 1997, referring to the company. “I am not inferring any malicious intent here, just that they lack sophistication, because this is not their bread and butter.” If the FDA has already audited some of the trial sites used by Philip Morris, the agency “should carefully review its audits and possibly expand them,” said Kessler, a former dean of the medical school at Yale University. Tom Eissenberg, who served on the FDA’s tobacco products scientific advisory committee until earlier this year, said: “The FDA should audit.” Reuters did not find any evidence that the outcome of the experiments presented by the company to the FDA was manipulated or falsified.     The new insights into the company’s clinical trial program for iQOS come at a crucial time for Philip Morris. The world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company by market value and maker of Marlboro cigarettes has applied to the U.S. FDA to be able to sell iQOS in America, and also for permission to market it as a modified-risk tobacco product. That designation could mean that Philip Morris is allowed to market iQOS as presenting less harm or risk of disease to users than traditional tobacco. For now, the FDA is evaluating the company’s studies. Reuters outlined its findings about the iQOS trials to the agency. The FDA said it cannot comment on a pending application. Philip Morris says the device, which heats small tobacco inserts, is meant for smokers who would not otherwise quit. Its chief executive officer, Andre Calantzopoulos, has told investors and media alike that he intends to one day replace cigarettes with products like iQOS. So far, iQOS makes up a fraction of the company’s $75 billion revenues and Philip Morris continues to market conventional cigarettes across the globe. Internal Philip Morris documents reviewed by Reuters show the significance of iQOS goes beyond its profit potential. The device is now sold in more than two dozen nations after it was first launched in Japan and Italy during late 2014. The company has a 10-year plan for what it calls “normalization” of the tobacco industry, according to a 2014 strategy document. The industry has been shunned over the past two decades for producing and marketing products that kill people and previously lying about it. Under a section on “strategies and actions” to achieve that goal, the document lists, among other things, new smoking devices such as iQOS and the scientific research involved in developing them. Told about that document, Philip Morris said: “The suggestion that the purpose of our development of IQOS and our scientific research program is to ‘normalize’ the tobacco industry is false.” That previously undisclosed document and others can be found in a searchable repository published by Reuters, The Philip Morris Files. (reut.rs/2sT51xF) As part of its submission to the U.S. FDA, the company said the results of its research showed the device significantly reduced the level of certain harmful substances that users were exposed to compared with cigarettes, and satisfied their nicotine cravings. “In fact the level of reduction is so considerable, it approaches 95% of the levels measured in smokers who quit altogether,” the company said in a statement to Reuters. Taken along with the company’s laboratory studies, Philip Morris said, the research program “in its entirety demonstrates that IQOS is likely to reduce the risk of smoking related diseases.” Philip Morris is responsible for the majority of the science that has been published about iQOS. “Those who criticize us should probably look at our science,” said Tommaso Di Giovanni, a company spokesman, during a tour of Philip Morris’ research and development headquarters in March. The eight clinical experiments that Philip Morris submitted to the FDA were conducted between 2013 and 2015. For one study, scientists in Texas and Florida did not respond to messages left by Reuters. Other scientists, in Belfast and Tokyo, declined to talk. Half of the eight studies were done in Japan. FDA guidelines for conducting clinical studies say a trial should adhere to standards such as Good Clinical Practice. That best-practices document says investigators “should be qualified by training and experience and should have adequate resources” to properly conduct a trial. Masayuki Sugimoto, the principal investigator who oversaw testing at one facility used by Philip Morris to conduct a trial, said his Tokyo clinic is “heavily in the red.” Sugimoto said he generally has little confidence that all the participants in experiments like the one he ran for Philip Morris on nicotine tell the truth about their smoking history – that is, whether they smoke. Speaking about the final study report from the Philip Morris trial, Sugimoto said in an interview that he generally doesn’t have time to read such things in detail. He said he probably signed a document indicating he had received the final report. Sugimoto gestured with his thumb and forefinger to indicate a thick document: “I just don’t read them.” Philip Morris said that it “did not receive any such comments or statements from the PI,” or principal investigator. Sugimoto’s study, it said, was completed “without any issues.” The company said the study data was reviewed and discussed with the investigator throughout the trial. The Japanese company hired to monitor studies in the country, CMIC Holdings Co Ltd (2309.T), said in a statement that researchers confirmed that trial participants were smokers by using urine tests. Asked about the tests, Sugimoto said he thought they would prevent non-smokers from joining the trial but added, “I don’t know whether they were done that rigorously.” Told of Sugimoto’s doubts about the honesty of study participants, Eissenberg, who served on the FDA’s tobacco products scientific advisory committee from 2011 to 2017, said “it raises a great deal of concern.” A principal investigator “is required to make sure that the participants meet the inclusion-exclusion criteria that are in the protocol,” said Eissenberg. He was referring to the fact that clinical trial subjects’ backgrounds – such as whether they are smokers – should meet the parameters of the experiment for the data to be valid. “And a PI should have confidence in that,” he said. At another laboratory in Japan, issues with how the study was carried out were so acute that data from 56 participants was thrown out, raising questions about the competence of the principal investigator. Philip Morris halted the study at that location. In the company’s study documentation released by the FDA, Philip Morris recorded the reason for discarding the data as non-compliance with good clinical practices, specifically “failure of the site to meet sample collection procedures and data recording procedures.” Kishor Lad, who was Philip Morris’ data manager on the study, said the site crossed a line of what’s allowed during such trials: It collected samples before getting informed consent forms signed by the volunteers. “Completely a no-no in the GCP world,” Lad said, using the acronym for good clinical practice. Philip Morris confirmed to Reuters that “informed consent was not obtained prior to execution of a study procedure” – specifically, the collection of urine samples. The problem was identified by CMIC, the contract research group, during a routine monitoring visit, Philip Morris said. A subsequent round of audits, it added, “led to prompt discontinuation of the study at the Seishukai Clinic.” The incident, the company said, was properly logged in the study report and the submission to the FDA. “It suggests the investigator had no idea, did not understand or just didn’t care what his responsibilities were in conducting the study,” said Greg Koski, a former director of the U.S. federal Office for Human Research Protections, which advocates for research subjects. “This is such a flagrant violation, that investigator shouldn’t be doing clinical studies.” Mamoru Oki was the principal investigator at the time at the facility, the Seishukai Clinic in Tokyo. Reached by phone, Oki said: “My specialty is urology and I don’t know anything about tobacco, so I cannot talk.” Told of that remark, Philip Morris said: “Dr. Oki was qualified and trained specifically on the product.” Dorothy Hatsukami, a member of the FDA’s tobacco products scientific advisory committee from 2010 to 2013, said a principal investigator’s professed lack of knowledge about tobacco is not ideal. “For any tobacco-related clinical trial, an investigator with a background in tobacco product research would have better qualifications to evaluate the study results than a novice,” she said. The study continued at a parallel site, the Tokyo Heart Center.  During an interview at the center, principal investigator Masahiro Endo said repeatedly that he had no idea what the results were from his study. “We did medically safe and accurate blood samples, but were not told the results. So even if we are asked questions, we won’t be able to answer,” he said. “We were paid, it ended there.” But in a statement signed last year and submitted by Philip Morris to the FDA, Endo said he had read the clinical study report from the company and confirmed “that to the best of my knowledge it accurately describes the conduct and results of the study.” Principal investigators in all of the Philip Morris clinical trials signed the same statement. A day after speaking with Reuters, Endo sent an email clarifying that after checking his records he saw that he’d signed a receipt saying he received a report on the results and acknowledging that he’d be listed as the principal investigator. He had spoken during the interview “with a fuzzy memory,” Endo said. Clinical trial experts interviewed by Reuters said it’s not uncommon for principal investigators to be unaware of test results sent to a third party specialty laboratory for analysis. But they also emphasized that if companies want better science, they need the investigators to be more involved with all aspects of a study. “It seems like the investigator here is in the role of a technician, not as a principal investigator,” said Kessler, the former FDA commissioner. Kessler said it’s hard to understand how such investigators could have signed off on the clinical study report “when they clearly were not versed in the study results.” Other principal investigators described their work differently. Fumimasa Nobuoka, a principal investigator on one of the trials in Japan, said he read the Philip Morris study report: “I thought it was well done, well written.” James Borders, who was the principal investigator for a study held in Lexington, Kentucky, said the experiments in his trial were done ethically and followed sound scientific practice. Borders, who became chief medical officer at the Baptist Health Lexington hospital, said such studies help consumers make an informed decision. His decision to be involved with the study, he said, hinged on the proposition that a device like iQOS could be the “lesser of two evils.” Philip Morris said that while it sponsored the clinical trials, the experiments were “performed by reputable research facilities” and monitored by contract research organizations – companies used to oversee such studies. It hired U.S.-based Covance Inc to serve as its global contract research organization, according to an internal Philip Morris 2013 assessment plan. Covance, a unit of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH.N), declined to comment. CMIC, the company hired to monitor the Japan studies, said in a statement: “All the clinical trials you referred to were conducted in accordance with GCP guidelines” – good clinical practices – “and we believe that the results of the trials are scientifically trustworthy.” As part of her job coordinating between Philip Morris and those contracted to run its clinical trials, Koval, the former company scientist, conducted medical safety training across the world for principal investigators and others involved with the iQOS studies. During one study training session in Tokyo, Koval said, she realized some of the researchers could not speak English well and she was unable to communicate with them. Koval said she does not speak Japanese and there was no interpreter present. “I was like, Jesus, what are we doing here?” she said. At dinner later, Koval said, she saw two of the men, and they were unable to describe in English what their jobs were. When asked about Koval’s session, Philip Morris said it was a meeting with its contract research organization and others. It added that “all PIs and team members with active roles in the study were fluent in English.” But Sugimoto, one of the Japanese principal investigators, told Reuters in an interview, “I can’t speak English.” And Endo, another of the lead researchers, said that when Philip Morris executives visited his site someone was present who helped translate “questions like whether to cut the crusts off bread” when giving food to study subjects. CMIC said, “All the principal investigators received adequate training in Japanese before the trial began.” In Poland, some urine samples collected as part of one Philip Morris clinical study exceeded the limits of what a human being is capable of producing in a single day, according to Koval and Lad, the former clinical data manager. Lad, who worked at Philip Morris from 2012 to 2015, said he didn’t think anything “malicious” had happened. Maybe urine samples were swapped or there was a mistake with the containers used to collect the urine, he said. But when the principal investigator for the Polish site was asked about the results, she would not admit there was a problem, Lad and Koval said. Instead, they said, the scientist explained that the test subjects were large Polish men. Philip Morris said that “a few participants” in an early stage of the trial “produced unusually large volumes of urine.” Because medical tests showed no problems with the subjects, the company said, the investigator did not initially consider the samples to be “adverse events.” After discussion with the medical monitors of the study as well as Philip Morris, the investigator “ultimately decided to mark these incidences as adverse events,” the company said. An investigation at the site confirmed that researchers had followed study protocol and good clinical practices, the company said. The principal investigator running the study in Poland for Philip Morris, Katarzyna Jarus-Dziedzic, declined to discuss what happened with the urine case at her site, citing confidentiality.  Koval said that after she raised concerns about the Polish study with Philip Morris executives in Switzerland she was excluded from meetings. Philip Morris said in a statement that Koval was “part of the team” that followed up on the urine samples. In fact, the company said, she was “an active member” of the group that finalized the data set from the studies for further analysis. Koval confirmed that she was part of the team and involved with the data set. But she stood by her account that she was shut out of conversations and meetings about the urine samples. In 2014, Philip Morris terminated her contract, Koval said. She said she returned to the pharmaceutical industry a few months later and now works for Swiss drugs giant Novartis AG (NOVN.S). After leaving Philip Morris, Koval was given a certificate of service that said, “Tamara drove clinical program development activities.” It said she had demonstrated “professionalism” and “unwavering commitment” in her work.

213,PM,Philip Morris' search for a cigarette no more harmful than a cup of coffee,"NEUCHATEL, Switzerland (Reuters) - When Hans-Joerg Urban joined Philip Morris International Inc’s (PM.N) research headquarters as a scientist in 2005, he said a senior executive laid out the tobacco giant’s vision for the future: to create cigarettes no more harmful than a simple cup of coffee. About a decade later that quest culminated in the iQOS, a device that heats tobacco but does not burn it. Philip Morris says the lack of combustion means smokers are exposed to far lower levels of toxic emissions than with regular cigarettes. “The ultimate result of this is reduced tobacco related harm and diseases,” the company said in a statement. The world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company by market value has applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market iQOS as less harmful than cigarettes. But four scientists and researchers who worked for the company on the iQOS program told Reuters that while Philip Morris was able to prove the lower amounts of exposure to harmful substances, that doesn’t necessarily mean that using the device is less likely to result in disease than regular cigarettes. “Exposure is not directly linked to the risk of having a disease,” said Urban, a scientist who worked at Philip Morris until 2010 analyzing data from clinical and laboratory experiments. “The diseases are much too complicated.” Dorothy Hatsukami, a former member of the FDA’s tobacco products scientific advisory committee, agrees. “At this point, research is still too nascent to say with certainty that reduced exposure translates into reduced risk,” she said. Philip Morris is seeking FDA approval to market iQOS under two different standards. It has applied for approval as a device that reduces exposure to harmful substances.

214,PM,Philip Morris' search for a cigarette no more harmful than a cup of coffee,"NEUCHATEL, Switzerland, Dec 20 (Reuters) - When Hans-Joerg Urban joined Philip Morris International Inc’s research headquarters as a scientist in 2005, he said a senior executive laid out the tobacco giant’s vision for the future: to create cigarettes no more harmful than a simple cup of coffee. About a decade later that quest culminated in the iQOS, a device that heats tobacco but does not burn it. Philip Morris says the lack of combustion means smokers are exposed to far lower levels of toxic emissions than with regular cigarettes. “The ultimate result of this is reduced tobacco related harm and diseases,” the company said in a statement. The world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company by market value has applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market iQOS as less harmful than cigarettes. But four scientists and researchers who worked for the company on the iQOS program told Reuters that while Philip Morris was able to prove the lower amounts of exposure to harmful substances, that doesn’t necessarily mean that using the device is less likely to result in disease than regular cigarettes. “Exposure is not directly linked to the risk of having a disease,” said Urban, a scientist who worked at Philip Morris until 2010 analyzing data from clinical and laboratory experiments. “The diseases are much too complicated.” Dorothy Hatsukami, a former member of the FDA’s tobacco products scientific advisory committee, agrees. “At this point, research is still too nascent to say with certainty that reduced exposure translates into reduced risk,” she said. Philip Morris is seeking FDA approval to market iQOS under two different standards. It has applied for approval as a device that reduces exposure to harmful substances. It has also applied on a second track with a higher bar – to get approval to market it as carrying reduced risk of tobacco-related disease. The first option, a special provision for companies that are unable to meet the threshold of reduced risk, comes with a restriction. Consumers cannot be “misled into believing” the product is less harmful than other tobacco products, FDA regulations say.

215,PM,Special Report: How Philip Morris is selling regulators on its hot new smoking device,"By Paritosh Bansal, Tom Lasseter, Duff Wilson Thomas Wilson, Ami Miyazaki and Aditya Kalra TOKYO/TEL AVIV/BOGOTA (Reuters) - In Tokyo’s upscale Ginza shopping district, around the corner from the sparkling storefronts of Tiffany & Co and Cartier, shoppers searching for a new device called iQOS can buy it in a boutique behind a glass façade. The store combines a high-tech aesthetic with the feel of an exclusive club: The young woman at the door says a members-only smoking lounge is upstairs. The device is advertised under the slogan, “This changes everything,” with a hummingbird in fluorescent green and blue floating in midair. From the small “i” of its name when it was rolled out to the minimalist white box it comes in, the iQOS evokes the marketing-and-design savvy of the American technology giant Apple Inc. But this little machine is sold by the tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc. And it isn’t a smartphone. The iQOS is essentially an electronic cigarette that heats – without burning – plugs of tobacco, releasing tendrils of nicotine-laced aerosol. And the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company by market value, which has spent more than $3 billion in developing new smoking devices, says iQOS is nothing less than its future. Philip Morris International says the lack of combustion means iQOS produces far lower levels of carcinogens than regular cigarettes. It’s early days, but iQOS is already bringing in piles of cash. The device drove up sales of the company’s new-generation smoking products to nearly $1 billion in the last quarter, from some $200 million just a year ago. Wowing consumers with the prospect of a less harmful smoke built on flashy technology is essential to iQOS’ rapid success. Consumers, though, aren’t the only target. Interviews with government officials and trade groups reveal how the company is seeking to sell national authorities on the benefits of the device, before regulators can toss up hurdles. A key objective: convince governments of iQOS’ benefits so they don’t slap the same taxes and restrictions on the device as they do on cigarettes. Philip Morris is employing a novel argument: The tobacco plugs inserted into the iQOS device shouldn’t be classified as cigarettes because they do not burn or produce smoke. And the device itself, the company says, is an electronic product and so should not be regulated like tobacco. In Japan, Philip Morris blitzed officials with the science of iQOS to persuade them to classify the device in a way that would lead to a lower tax rate than cigarettes. In Israel, the company flew in an executive to convince a senior health official of the upside of the device. And in Colombia, the health ministry says Philip Morris launched iQOS without seeking the agency’s approval. The approach is outlined in internal company documents seen by Reuters. Evidence that iQOS “is ‘not smoked’ is the most critical element,” says a 2014 PowerPoint briefing on iQOS and other new smoking devices. Reuters has published that document and others in a searchable repository, The Philip Morris Files. (reut.rs/2sT51xF) Other traditional cigarette companies, notably British American Tobacco Plc and Japan Tobacco Inc, have launched similar devices. None have reported anything close to the global sales of iQOS. The iQOS is championed by Andre Calantzopoulos, Philip Morris International’s chief executive, who in media interviews makes the point that he smokes the device. In September last year, Calantzopoulos told investors it was the company’s “aim to become the undisputed leader” of a new tobacco category it dubs “reduced-risk products.” The goal he said, is to have “RRPs” ultimately replace regular cigarettes. Philip Morris now has an application pending at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for permission to market the device in America as being less harmful than cigarettes. A Reuters investigation published Wednesday identified shortcomings in the training and professionalism of some of the lead investigators in the clinical trials that underpin the tobacco giant’s application to the FDA. Former Philip Morris employees and contractors described irregularities in those experiments. The company chose Japan as its first iQOS market, launching in late 2014. If the company could achieve its goals in “priority” markets like Japan, it would provide “good reference points to other countries,” said the 2014 Philip Morris presentation on reduced-risk products like iQOS. It unveiled the device in an unlikely venue – Nagoya, a city of more than 2 million people on a bay of the Pacific Ocean. Nagoya is close to Toyota Motor Corp’s headquarters, a town of skyscrapers and automotive plants; a place with neither the buzz of Tokyo nor the charm of Kyoto. At first, business lagged. An internal company review of Asia, dated June 2015, put iQOS sales figures toward the end of the Japan market rundown. It showed iQOS sales dropping about 40 percent from that January to May. Philip Morris pushed ahead with a national expansion in September 2015. In an in-house newsletter for the Japan operations the next month, Ashok Rammohan, director of reduced-risk products, told employees that “building iQOS will take time and focus as we need to educate LAS” – legal-age smokers. By early 2016, the buzz surrounding iQOS in Japan was growing, thanks in part to a group of Japanese entertainers. That April, six popular Japanese comedians were on a national TV show when the presenters began to talk about smoking. One of the comedians, Terumoto Goto, a household name, held up a red iQOS. “It doesn’t release smoke,” he explained. “It’s like steam coming out of my mouth.” The five men sitting around him on the TV set, decorated with bright rainbow stripes, held up iQOS units as well. Goto said he bought an iQOS because his wife wouldn’t let him smoke cigarettes inside their house and the neighbors didn’t like him standing around and smoking outside. Toshiyuki Itakura, just behind Goto, chimed in about smoking the device in public: “There doesn’t seem to be any harm.” Searches on Google for the Japanese word for iQOS spiked that day. The talent agency that represents Goto and Itakura, Yoshimoto Kogyo Co Ltd, said in a statement: “Our company received absolutely no payment from Philip Morris or affiliated companies” for the appearance. The network that carried the show, TV Asahi Corp, said it did not consult with the tobacco company beforehand. That promotional bump came during a period when Philip Morris was working to use social media to propel iQOS into the national consciousness. “That IQOS moment.” “My IQOS way of living.” Those are two of the catchphrases the company’s social media team considered using as catalysts to promote online chatter about the device. The guidance appears in a 2017 online-content strategy paper, marked “confidential,” that cites examples from Japan. A separate document, a 54-page training handbook for social media teams in 2016, warns that the company’s postings walk a fine line. “Since the law is set up to prevent tobacco companies from promoting their products on social media, and iQOS is a product that uses tobacco, you’ll always be walking through a minefield of sorts,” the document says. Away from the public eye, Philip Morris employees equipped with pages of scientific findings were lobbying government officials in Japan. They set out to convince regulators to tax iQOS at a lower rate than cigarettes and exempt it from ordinances that ban smoking in public places and restaurants. Koki Okamoto, a member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, said the city’s planned public smoking regulations almost certainly will exempt iQOS. “My personal view, as a lawyer, is that there will be reluctance to apply penalties to something without scientific evidence on health hazards,” said Okamoto, a lead for tobacco control issues in the party that won the capital’s elections this July. To date, Philip Morris is responsible for the majority of the science that has been published about iQOS.  Philip Morris executives say the product is meant only for people who would not otherwise quit smoking. That is inconsistent with where the company has chosen to introduce iQOS.  Industry sales numbers show Philip Morris is selling iQOS almost entirely in countries where cigarette sales are already in decline – in other words, where people are quitting. While the global average for cigarette sales was down 1.9 percent from 2005 to 2016, in 30 countries where iQOS is now sold the drop in sales was about 30 percent, according to a Reuters analysis of industry numbers from Euromonitor International. Philip Morris said in response that there are more than 180 million smokers in the countries where iQOS has been launched. “Those 180 million people deserve an opportunity to switch to a potentially less harmful product than cigarettes,” the company said. As the company honed its strategy in Japan – impressing officials with its scientific findings while advocating for lower taxes – it set out to conquer new markets. More than half a year before iQOS launched in Israel, Moira Gilchrist, a corporate affairs vice president for reduced-risk products, flew into the Holy Land and took a March 2016 meeting with a senior health ministry official to talk about the company’s science. A few weeks after that meeting, the official, Itamar Grotto, sent a letter to the country’s tax authority saying iQOS was in a new product category exempt from marketing and advertising restrictions on tobacco products. In a later court filing, Philip Morris cited the letter in explaining its decision to launch iQOS in Israel.  Asked why he said iQOS was exempt from tobacco regulations, Grotto told Reuters that the ministry was being cautious after losing a case against e-cigarette companies a few years earlier. Grotto also said he thought at the time that the question of regulating iQOS was “theoretical.” He had understood from Philip Morris that it did not plan to market the device in Israel until it had approval from a European or American regulatory authority, Grotto said.  Told of Grotto’s remarks, Philip Morris said in a statement, “We did not state that PMI would wait for the approval of a foreign regulatory authority.” In Israel, iQOS has faced obstacles. This March, a group headed by an activist named Shabi Gatenio challenged the health ministry and Philip Morris in the country’s top court over the sale of iQOS without the same marketing restrictions imposed on regular cigarettes. An Israeli tobacco company also challenged the government and Philip Morris in a similar filing.  During an interview in Tel Aviv, Gatenio, 45, marveled at the reach and access of Philip Morris. He said within two and half hours of his filing the court petition, before it had become public, he got a text message from Erez Gil-Har, co-chief executive of Policy Ltd, Philip Morris’ powerful lobbying company in Israel. The message, viewed by Reuters, accused Gatenio of becoming a “tool” in the hands of the local tobacco company – a charge he dismisses.  Gil-Har, who attended the meeting with Grotto and Philip Morris’ Gilchrist, declined to comment. The tobacco company, Dubek Ltd, declined to talk as well. Before the court could give a final ruling, the health ministry reversed its position and said it would treat iQOS as it does traditional cigarettes. The ministry said it planned to revisit its decision after seeing how the U.S. FDA regulates the product. The about-turn left Philip Morris scrambling. According to a government official familiar with the matter, Philip Morris hired more than two dozen women for an urgent task: They manually peeled off the old labels from thousands of tobacco-insert packs in a warehouse near Tel Aviv and stuck on new ones with more prominent health warnings. The packs were then released. Half a world away in Colombia, Philip Morris kicked off its sale of iQOS this March with a large white balloon at a music festival. Emblazoned with “iQOS” in blue and green letters, the balloon was hoisted 20 feet in the air by a crane. Tobacco advertising and promotion are banned in Colombia, the first country in Latin America to get iQOS. According to a health ministry official, Philip Morris launched iQOS without getting approval from the agency to sell the tobacco inserts in the country as is required by law.  “This is a product which is derived from tobacco and which must have a prior evaluation by this ministry,” said senior health ministry official Jose Fernando Valderrama.  Philip Morris said it is in compliance with Colombian law. The company said it is required to submit the tobacco inserts for health ministry approval following the release of the agency’s tobacco warnings in November each year. Its Colombian affiliate will do so “in the next month,” the company said in a Dec. 7 statement to Reuters. On a stroll through the capital Bogota a few months ago, iQOS could be seen being sold at the front of a restaurant with bright displays of packs of the tobacco inserts and the hummingbird emblem facing the sidewalk. In a trendy quarter of the city, a large white billboard advertised a coming “iQOS Boutique,” next to a Starbucks and an Apple retailer.  A former Philip Morris employee in Bogota said the company’s position is that because the device itself does not include tobacco, unlike the inserts, marketing restrictions don’t apply to it. The company confirmed that position, saying iQOS is an electronic device, and “as such, the current tobacco law does not regulate its commercialization as a tobacco product.” Back in Japan, sales of the device have taken off. Philip Morris says the iQOS tobacco inserts made up 11.9 percent of the Japanese tobacco market in the third quarter, up from 3.5 percent a year ago. That growth took on additional significance for company revenue in light of the lower tax rates. The iQOS kit retails for about 11,000 Japanese yen, roughly $100. The company said that cigarettes in Japan are taxed at 60 percent, while the iQOS tobacco inserts – priced about the same as a pack of Marlboros – are at 51 percent.  Philip Morris shows no signs of slowing down. Paul Riley, president of the company’s operations in Japan, this January called on Emiko Takagai, who as a former vice health minister is an influential voice on national health policy. They met in Takagai’s seventh-floor office in Tokyo, one decorated with stuffed animals and posters of healthy food groups. During that conversation, Riley laid out the company’s pitch on iQOS, said Takagai. In documents later sent to her office, Philip Morris said the product reduces the levels of harmful substances by at least 90 percent compared to regular cigarettes. When Reuters in August interviewed Takagai, a member of the upper house of parliament for the nation’s ruling party, it seemed the tobacco giant’s message was hitting home.  If the company’s scientific claims bear out, she said, “we must make efforts to thoroughly tell people.” ",12212017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tobacco-iqos-marketing-specialreport/special-report-how-philip-morris-is-selling-regulators-on-its-hot-new-smoking-device-idUSKBN1EF1H8

218,PM,UPDATE 2-U.S. FDA releases initial review of Philip Morris' iQOS device,"(Adds analyst comment, background) By Toni Clarke Jan 22 (Reuters) - An electronic product made by Philip Morris International Inc that heats rather than burns tobacco contains lower levels of harmful and potentially harmful compounds than cigarettes, a preliminary review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded on Monday. Laboratory data showed that the aerosol produced by the product, iQOS, can damage cells and affect human tissue, but that the effects “are generally less severe and observed at much higher concentrations,” compared to cigarette smoke. The reviewers said full results from a pending study would provide more information about the carcinogenic potential of iQOS, but the results are not expected to become available until later this year. The review comes two days before a meeting of outside advisors to the FDA who will discuss the product and recommend whether it should be allowed on the market. The panel will also decide whether the company should be allowed to claim iQOS is less harmful than cigarettes. The FDA is not obliged to follow the recommendations of its advisors, but typically does. Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, said the hurdle is high, but she believes the company’s application “has a decent chance of prevailing.” That is in part because the FDA under Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has committed to a tobacco policy that relies on the availability of reduced-risk products to help smokers obtain nicotine in a less damaging form. The FDA’s plan, announced last year, “signals its seriousness with regard to supporting the development of a viable market of FDA-approved reduced-risk product alternatives to combustible cigarettes,” Herzog said in a research note In order to be authorized at all, Switzerland-based Philip Morris and its partner Altria Group Inc must show that the iQOS is “appropriate for the protection of public health,” meaning any benefit to an individual smoker cannot come at the expense of added danger to the population as a whole. In theory, the agency could allow the product on the market, but not permit the company to specifically market it as less dangerous. Philip Morris hopes to claim iQOS is less risky or less harmful than cigarettes. Failing that the company would like to claim that the product reduces a smoker’s exposure to harmful compounds compared with cigarettes, a potentially easier hurdle to clear. The FDA found in its review that by some respiratory and cardiovascular measures, iQOS aerosol exposure produced less damage than cigarette smoke. The reviewers also noted there was little difference seen in the development of certain potentially pre-cancerous lesions in the respiratory tract. Overall, data from the nonclinical studies suggest that iQOS aerosol has lower toxic potential than cigarette smoke under the conditions used in the tests and for the non-cancer conditions measured. But they said it is “unclear how the effects observed in treatment groups exposed to iQOS aerosols translate to a potential risk reduction for noncancer-related effects when chronically used by humans.” ",1222018,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-tobacco-pmi/update-2-u-s-fda-releases-initial-review-of-philip-morris-iqos-device-idUSL2N1PH0SR

220,PM,UPDATE 2-Philip Morris sees 6 mln U.S. smokers switching to iQOS device if cleared,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc told a U.S. advisory panel on Wednesday that it expects around 6 million smokers to switch completely to its iQOS electronic tobacco device if the company is allowed to claim it is less risky than cigarettes. The sleek, penlike iQOS device heats tobacco but does not burn it. The company hopes to convince the U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel that the product contains fewer harmful chemicals than cigarettes and reduces the risk of smoking-related diseases for smokers who switch. The panel will discuss the company’s application for two days and on Thursday will vote on whether the company’s data supports one of three potential “modified risk” claims that would be used on the product’s label and in marketing. The vote is not binding but will influence the FDA’s decision.  Electronic cigarettes currently on the market use a nicotine-laced liquid. Most toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke are produced when tobacco combusts. IQOS is used by nearly 4 million people in 30 markets outside the United States but needs FDA authorization to be marketed in America. (Last month, a Reuters investigation described irregularities in the clinical trials that supported Philip Morris' iQOS application to the FDA. (here) and (here) ) Philip Morris says iQOS produces up to 95 percent fewer potentially harmful chemicals than regular cigarettes. The company said if 15 percent of U.S. daily smokers switched completely to iQOS it would translate to about 6 million smokers over seven to 10 years. The figure does not include smokers who might use iQOS in addition to cigarettes. Moira Gilchrist, Philip Morris’ vice president of scientific and public communications, estimated that 90,000 smoking-related deaths could have been averted over 20 years based on an assumed switch rate of 15 percent. The panel’s discussion comes amid an intense debate over the potential risks and benefits associated with e-cigarettes. On Tuesday, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, summarizing data from hundreds of scientific studies, said e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes and help smokers quit. But the report also found “substantial evidence” that youths who use e-cigarettes are more likely to try traditional cigarettes.  FDA staff in a preliminary review of Philip Morris’ application said that iQOS contains fewer harmful chemicals than cigarettes but that it was unclear whether reduced exposure translates into reduced risk of disease. Results of a study in mice that could shed additional light on additional cancer risk are expected in June.  The advisory panel will recommend whether the company should be allowed to claim that iQOS “can reduce the risks of tobacco-related diseases” or that it “presents less risk of harm than continuing to smoke cigarettes.”  A third, easier-to-prove claim would state that iQOS “significantly reduces your body’s exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals.” The FDA is expected to decide whether Philip Morris can sell iQOS within the next few months. It will decide separately whether to authorize the modified-risk claims.    If cleared, iQOS would be sold in the United States by Philip Morris’ partner Altria Group Inc.

221,PM,U.S. health advisers weigh risks of novel Philip Morris tobacco device,"WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. health advisers on Wednesday began to consider whether Philip Morris International Inc should be allowed to claim its novel electronic tobacco product is less harmful than cigarettes, potentially making it the first such device to carry a reduced risk claim. The panel of tobacco and public health experts, convened by the Food and Drug Administration, will vote on Thursday on whether data provided by the company supports one of three potential claims that would be used on the product’s label and in marketing. The vote is not binding but will influence the FDA’s decision. Its iQOS device heats actual tobacco rather than burns it. Most toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke are produced when tobacco combusts. Other electronic devices usual a nicotine-laced liquid. A positive vote from the panel could move more U.S. smokers away from cigarettes to electronic alternatives. The panel discussion comes amid an intense debate over whether electronic cigarettes can help reduce smoking-related disease and death. FDA staff this week said that iQOS contains fewer harmful chemicals than cigarettes but that it was unclear whether reduced exposure translates into reduced risk of disease. Results from an 18-month toxicity and carcinogenicity study in mice is expected by the end of June. Some of the data is included in the company’s application. Full results of the study could shed additional light on any potential cancer risk, the FDA said. (For a Reuters investigation on Philip Morris's clinical trials of iQOS, see here here) The advisory panel will decide whether the company can say iQOS “can reduce the risks of tobacco-related diseases” or it “presents less risk of harm than continuing to smoke cigarettes.” These would be the hardest-to-prove claims. A third option would state that iQOS “significantly reduces your body’s exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals.” Manuel Peitsch, the company’s chief scientific officer, told the committee on Wednesday that “iQOS emits toxicants and is not risk free,” he said. “Nevertheless, iQOS emits significantly lower levels of toxicants than cigarettes.” Taken together, he said, “these results show that switching to iQOS can reduce the risk of tobacco-related disease.” On Tuesday, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, summarizing data from hundreds of scientific studies, said e-cigarettes are safer than cigarettes and help smokers quit. But the report also found “substantial evidence” that youths who use e-cigarettes are more likely to try traditional cigarettes. The National Academies’ report said the overall long-term public health impact of e-cigarettes remained unclear. The FDA is expected to decide whether Philip Morris can sell iQOS within the next few months. It will decide separately whether to authorize the modified risk claims.

222,PM,U.S. panel deals blow to Philip Morris tobacco device,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Philip Morris International Inc should not be allowed to claim its iQOS electronic tobacco product is less risky than cigarettes, U.S. health advisers said on Thursday, dealing a blow to the company as it seeks to strengthen its portfolio of alternative nicotine devices. The recommendation is not binding and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could still allow Philip Morris to make such a claim, but some analysts think the agency might ask for additional data first. “It’s a process,” said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo. The FDA will likely approve the request eventually, she said, “but timing is tough to predict.” Philip Morris, which has spent more than $3 billion to develop products that can counteract the decline in traditional cigarette sales, said it was encouraged by some of the committee members’ comments that iQOS may have risk-reduction potential. “We are confident in our ability to address the valid questions raised by the Committee with the FDA as the review process for our application continues,” Corey Henry, a Philip Morris spokesman, said in a statement.

He said it could amend the application and the panel’s recommendation does not rule out an ultimate approval.  The panel said Philip Morris had not proven that iQOS reduced harm compared with cigarettes. It did conclude that the product exposes users to lower levels of harmful chemicals but said the company had not shown that lowering exposure to those chemicals is reasonably likely to translate into a measurable reduction in disease or death. Philip Morris needs to show both in order to claim in its marketing materials that the product reduces a user’s exposure to harmful chemicals.

229,PM,"Exclusive: With Roman law doctrine, India moves to stub out tobacco industry rights","NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government is pushing the Supreme Court to apply a rarely used doctrine that would strip the $11 billion tobacco industry’s legal right to trade, an effort aimed at deterring tobacco companies from challenging tough new regulations. New Delhi has for the first time asked the top court to classify tobacco as “res extra commercium”, a Latin phrase meaning “outside commerce,” according to a Reuters review of previously unreported court filing by the Health Ministry on Jan. 8. If applied, the doctrine - which harkens back to Roman law - would have far reaching implications: in denying an industry’s legal standing to trade, it gives authorities more leeway to impose restrictions.  For example, the Supreme Court’s application of the doctrine to alcohol in the 1970s paved the way for at least two Indian states to ban it completely and allowed courts to take a stricter stance while regulating liquor - something constitutional law experts say could happen with tobacco if a similar ruling was made. “The effects of tobacco are much more than even alcohol ... It will be a fillip to this drive against tobacco,” said government lawyer R. Balasubramanian, who is acting on behalf of the Ministry of Health in pursuing the designation.  Balasubramanian, however, said the government is not discussing banning tobacco and the goal of invoking the Roman law doctrine was only to curtail the industry’s legal rights. With an aim to curb tobacco consumption - which kills more than 900,000 people each year in India - the government has in recent years raised tobacco taxes, started smoking cessation campaigns and introduced laws requiring covering most of the package in health warnings. But a court in southern Karnataka state last month quashed those labeling rules after the tobacco industry successfully argued the measure was “unreasonable” and violated its right to trade. The government this month appealed the ruling in the Supreme Court which put on hold the Karnataka court order. The top court will next hear the case on March 12. In its filing, the government included “res extra commercium” because it wants to stop the industry from pursuing such arguments again, said Balasubramanian.       Seeking to apply the doctrine to tobacco, the government argued it should have the power “to regulate business and to mitigate evils” to safeguard public health, the court filing showed. Sajan Poovayya, a senior lawyer representing top Indian cigarette maker ITC Ltd and Philip Morris International Inc’s Indian partner, Godfrey Phillips, said the industry’s legal rights would be severely limited if the court applies the doctrine to tobacco. Poovayya said he would fight the government’s argument “tooth and nail” and make a case that taking away the industry’s right to trade would imperil millions of Indian farmers who depend on tobacco for their living. The industry estimates 45.7 million people in India depend on tobacco for their living. “India is a tobacco growing country and there’s a need to look at the interest of those people who are already in the sector,” Poovayya said.  “Tobacco is not destructive to health. If tobacco is, sugar is as well.”  ITC and Godfrey Phillips, as well as India’s health ministry, did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement to Reuters, Philip Morris International said the company “is not a party to the lawsuit challenging India’s warning labels” and that it complies with labeling rules in the country. India’s tobacco labeling rules, which mandate 85 percent of a cigarette pack’s surface be covered in health warnings, have been a sticking point between the government and the tobacco industry since they were enforced in 2016. That year, the industry briefly shut factories across the country in protest and filed dozens of legal cases challenging the rules.      The federal health ministry says stringent health warnings on packages help reduce consumption of tobacco by making people aware of its ill-effects. A government survey last year found 62 percent of cigarette smokers thought of quitting because of warning labels on the packets. Mary Assunta, a long-time tobacco control advocate and a senior policy advisor at the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance, said she had never heard of a country applying the “res extra commercium” doctrine to tobacco, but hoped India would set a precedent. “Such a classification will help protect tobacco control measures from being challenged, particularly for developing countries where the bulk of the smokers are,” Assunta said.  The doctrine would open the door to an outright ban on tobacco sales if a state so wished, said Pratibha Jain, a partner at law firm Nishith Desai Associates and a specialist in Indian constitutional law. “It gives the state autonomy to completely ban trade in tobacco,” Jain said. “It gives governments the constitutional cover that will protect future litigation. The industry will lose significant ground as your protection of right to trade is gone.” ",2012018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-tobacco-pmi/exclusive-with-roman-law-doctrine-india-moves-to-stub-out-tobacco-industry-rights-idUSKBN1FL3IB

231,PM,Japan Tobacco to launch new smokeless product this year,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) said on Tuesday it plans to launch a new “heat-not-burn” (HNB) product in Japan as early as the end of this year, as it tries to catch Philip Morris International (PM.N) in a growing cigarette-alternative category.   Japan Tobacco is under pressure to keep its dominance in the domestic market where its sales of conventional cigarettes fell to the lowest since the former state monopoly was reorganized to the current company in 1985. Japan Tobacco is still one-third government-owned. It said it would spend more than 100 billion yen ($917.43 million) over the next three years on development and production of what it calls “reduced-risk products (RRP),” or cigarette alternatives that do not use combustion to deliver nicotine.  “For Japan Tobacco’s continuous growth, we must win in the RRP category,” Chief Executive Officer Masamichi Terabatake said at an earnings briefing. Japan has become a fertile market for HNB products as the country’s regulations effectively ban e-cigarettes that use nicotine-laced liquid. Tobacco makers have been struggling to ship enough products to meet demand as a growing number of smokers switch to these smokeless tobacco offerings. Mizuho Securities analyst Hiroshi Saji estimated HNB products will account for 29 percent of Japan’s tobacco market this year, up from 16 percent in 2017. He estimated Philip Morris to keep its lead in the HNB market with a 76.2 percent share, with the rest evenly held by Japan Tobacco and British American Tobacco PLC (BATS.L) Japan Tobacco, which commands over 60 percent of the domestic cigarette market, lags behind Philip Morris, which launched its IQOS device in Japan in 2014 and expanded nationwide in April 2016. Japan Tobacco introduced its Ploom Tech smokeless tobacco product in central Tokyo in June last year after production delays and is now trying to catch up with IQOS and BAT’s glo. Japan Tobacco said it now plans to expand sales of Ploom Tech nationwide in September and aims this year to sell 200 million packages of tobacco capsules for Ploom Tech, which is a pen-like battery-powered device. Japan Tobacco said it expects its domestic cigarette sales volume to decline by more than 16 percent in 2018, after falling 12.5 percent to 92.9 billion cigarettes in 2017, its lowest on record. The tobacco makers have said HNB products release fewer harmful chemicals than conventional cigarette since they do not combust, but their long-term health impact has not been verified. Japan Tobacco said operating profit fell 5.4 percent to 561.1 billion yen in 2017, as a sharp fall in domestic cigarette sales outweighed solid growth in its overseas tobacco business, which was partly boosted by a cost-cutting drive. For 2018, the company forecast flat profit growth at 561 billion yen, below an average estimate of 605 billion yen in a poll of 17 analysts, with the increase in HNB product sales not yet enough to offset a weak domestic cigarette business. The company said it expects HNB products to account for about 15 percent of its domestic tobacco business’s core revenue, which is forecast to fall 3 percent to 573 billion yen in 2018.

He estimated Philip Morris to keep its lead in the HNB market with a 76.2 percent share, with the rest evenly held by Japan Tobacco and British American Tobacco PLC (BATS.L) Japan Tobacco, which commands over 60 percent of the domestic cigarette market, lags behind Philip Morris, which launched its IQOS device in Japan in 2014 and expanded nationwide in April 2016. Japan Tobacco introduced its Ploom Tech smokeless tobacco product in central Tokyo in June last year after production delays and is now trying to catch up with IQOS and BAT’s glo. Japan Tobacco said it now plans to expand sales of Ploom Tech nationwide in September and aims this year to sell 200 million packages of tobacco capsules for Ploom Tech, which is a pen-like battery-powered device. Japan Tobacco said it expects its domestic cigarette sales volume to decline by more than 16 percent in 2018, after falling 12.5 percent to 92.9 billion cigarettes in 2017, its lowest on record. The tobacco makers have said HNB products release fewer harmful chemicals than conventional cigarette since they do not combust, but their long-term health impact has not been verified. Japan Tobacco said operating profit fell 5.4 percent to 561.1 billion yen in 2017, as a sharp fall in domestic cigarette sales outweighed solid growth in its overseas tobacco business, which was partly boosted by a cost-cutting drive. For 2018, the company forecast flat profit growth at 561 billion yen, below an average estimate of 605 billion yen in a poll of 17 analysts, with the increase in HNB product sales not yet enough to offset a weak domestic cigarette business. The company said it expects HNB products to account for about 15 percent of its domestic tobacco business’s core revenue, which is forecast to fall 3 percent to 573 billion yen in 2018.

233,PM,Japan Tobacco to launch new smokeless product this year,"TOKYO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Japan Tobacco Inc said on Tuesday it plans to launch a new “heat-not-burn” (HNB) product in Japan as early as the end of this year, as it tries to catch Philip Morris International in a growing cigarette-alternative category. Japan Tobacco is under pressure to keep its dominance in the domestic market where its sales of conventional cigarettes fell to the lowest since the former state monopoly was reorganised to the current company in 1985. Japan Tobacco is still one-third government-owned. It said it would spend more than 100 billion yen ($917.43 million) over the next three years on development and production of what it calls “reduced-risk products (RRP),” or cigarette alternatives that do not use combustion to deliver nicotine. “For Japan Tobacco’s continuous growth, we must win in the RRP category,” Chief Executive Officer Masamichi Terabatake told a news conference. Japan has become a fertile market for HNB products as the country’s regulations effectively ban e-cigarettes that use nicotine-laced liquid. Tobacco makers have been struggling to ship enough products to meet demand as a growing number of smokers switch to these smokeless tobacco offerings. Mizuho Securities analyst Hiroshi Saji estimated HNB products will account for 29 percent of Japan’s tobacco market this year, up from 16 percent in 2017.

234,PM,U.S. senators ask FDA to reject Philip Morris' iQOS application,"WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Ten U.S. senators called on the Food and Drug Administration to reject Philip Morris International Inc’s (PM.N) application to market its iQOS smoking device as being less risky than cigarettes, according to a letter to the agency’s commissioner. The senators, all Democrats, cited remarks by an expert scientific panel that reviewed the application for the FDA and voted last month to recommend against granting Philip Morris permission to do so, according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.  The senators also referred to a Reuters report in December that identified shortcomings in the training and professionalism of some of the lead investigators in the clinical trials submitted to the FDA by Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes. Former Philip Morris employees and contractors also described irregularities in those experiments. Philip Morris International, the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company by market value, has applied to the FDA to be able to sell iQOS in America and for permission to market it as a modified-risk tobacco product. That designation could mean that Philip Morris would be allowed to sell iQOS to consumers as presenting less harm or risk of disease than traditional tobacco. By heating tobacco instead of burning it, the company says iQOS avoids subjecting smokers to the same levels of carcinogens and other toxic substances found in regular cigarettes. The device is part of a $3 billion-plus investment by Philip Morris in new-generation smoking platforms.  The senators’ letter, dated Feb. 7, asked FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb to “avoid rushing through new products, such as IQOS, to fit within this evolving FDA policy, without requiring strong evidence that any such product will reduce the risk of disease, result in a large number of smokers quitting, and not increase youth tobacco use.” It also said: “Such thorough review is especially critical given the tobacco industry’s deceitful history of marketing products under the guise of lower risk.” The signatories include Elizabeth Warren, a prominent Democratic voice in the Senate, and five members of the Senate’s powerful appropriations committee, including Dick Durbin and Jack Reed.     Durbin and Senator Richard Blumenthal, who also signed the letter, released statements to Reuters at the end of last month expressing concern about the iQOS application to the FDA. An FDA official said on Wednesday the agency had received the letter and would respond directly to the senators.     Philip Morris did not immediately respond to requests for  comment. A company spokesman referred to a Jan. 29 statement in which Chief Executive Andre Calantzopoulos said, “We look forward to working with the agency to clarify outstanding points so as to best assist in their ongoing decision-making process, which inherently entails a certain degree of scientific uncertainty pre-market.” The advisory panel said Philip Morris had not proven that iQOS reduced harm compared with cigarettes. It did conclude that iQOS exposes users to lower levels of harmful chemicals, but said the company had not shown that lowering exposure to those chemicals is reasonably likely to translate into a measurable reduction in disease or death. The recommendation is not binding.     Since the first of two days of meetings by the FDA scientific advisory panel on Jan. 24, which expressed doubts about Philip Morris’ application to the agency, the company’s stock has fallen about 9 percent as of the market’s close on Tuesday. The stock was down 0.7 percent Wednesday afternoon.     Philip Morris is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter earnings report on Thursday.

241,PM,Philip Morris may have breached Lithuania's advertising rules with new smoking device,"VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania’s tobacco regulator believes Philip Morris’s new electronic smoking device should be subject to the same advertising restrictions as tobacco, potentially dealing a blow to a product the company has touted as the future of smoking. Although the tobacco giant only risks a fine of up to 2,896 euros ($3,560) if it is found guilty of breaching Lithuanian advertising law, the case could have far-reaching consequences if it prompts regulators elsewhere to follow suit.  The Lithuanian watchdog is challenging Philip Morris International Inc’s assertion that its iQOS device is an electronic product, and so should not be regulated like tobacco. “After a six-month investigation, we could suspect that advertising of the iQOS device constitutes a possible indirect advertising of tobacco products, because this device can only be used to smoke tobacco products,” Jurgis Kazlauskas, tobacco and alcohol control chief at the regulator, told Reuters. The device, part of a $3 billion-plus investment by Philip Morris in new-generation smoking platforms, is designed to heat tobacco to a high enough temperature to create a vapor but not smoke. The firm says it is a novel device, different from other e-cigarettes that are often already subject to regulations. Kazlauskas said Philip Morris had been notified of its possible violation of Lithuanian advertising law, and that the regulator was expected to issue its final ruling in a month. Philip Morris spokesman told Reuters the company intended to challenge the findings. “We believe that our activities comply with the applicable regulations and look forward to further discussing our views with the regulator within the pending proceedings,” he said in a written statement to Reuters. The iQOS has been promoted extensively in Lithuania, and has stores on the main streets of its largest towns. The tobacco product used in the iQOS heating device, also sold by Philip Morris but branded as Heets, is already a subject to advertising restrictions similar to regular cigarettes. Earlier this month, ten U.S. senators called on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reject Philip Morris’s application to market the iQOS as less risky than cigarettes.

A warning from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker and Apple supplier, on soft demand for smartphones and on the semiconductor industry’s growth this year sparked a tumble in chip stocks. Apple’s shares also fell 2.4 percent, with analysts telling Reuters that TSMC’s warning was related to the iPhone maker. Apple was the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq. TSMC’s U.S.-listed shares fell 5.8 percent. Intel declined 3.1 percent, falling the most on the Dow. All the stocks on the Philadelphia SE semiconductor index were in the red, with the index itself tumbling 3.9 percent. “The broader tech weakness that you’re seeing is out of weak guidance that’s impacting Apple and the semiconductor space,” said Michael Hans, chief investment officer at New York City-based Clarfeld Financial Advisors. The only bright spot was the financial sector, which was up 1.2 percent, supported by American Express shares and a rise in 10-year Treasury yields to a near two-month high. “We’ve seen considerable rise in rates and a steepening of the yield curve and that’s been really benefiting the financials,” Hans said. The S&P; consumer staples sector declined 3.5 percent as Philip Morris plunged 16.5 percent after the tobacco company’s weak results and forecast. Philip Morris was the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 and also dragged Altria down 7.8 percent. Procter & Gamble also dropped 3.2 percent after the Dow component said shrinking retailer inventories and higher commodities and transportation costs squeezed its margins. At 12:42 p.m. ET, the Dow was down 0.50 percent, at 24,623.67. The S&P; 500 fell 0.79 percent to 2,687.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.87 percent to 7,231.51. AmEx jumped 6.2 percent after the credit card issuer topped Wall Street profit estimates. “What’s happening in this season is even if you meet (profit expectations), that’s not good enough, you’ve got to beat convincingly,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. Of the 52 companies among the S&P; 500 that have reported first-quarter earnings through Wednesday, 78.8 percent topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.56-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.70-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P; index recorded 23 new 52-week highs and 14 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 40 new lows.

251,PM,UPDATE 2-BAT boosts vaping investment again as competition heats up,"(Reuters) - British American Tobacco (BATS.L) is raising its investment in new vaping devices again, as Big Tobacco reacts to new competitors such as fast-growing U.S. group Juul.  Cigarette sales are declining, as more people curb the deadly habit due to rising taxes and a proliferation of alternatives such as e-cigarettes and gadgets that heat tobacco without burning it - making them potentially less harmful.   In February, BAT said it planned to increase spending on “next generation” products by 500 million pounds ($697 million)in 2018. On Wednesday, it said it expected to raise that further, based on the products’ good performance so far.  It did not give details beyond flagging plans for a significant number of launches towards the end of the third quarter. Jefferies analysts said that, while a long-term positive, the increased spending could add to near-term concerns over margins and profitability.  BAT, the world’s second-biggest international tobacco company by revenue, currently trails Philip Morris International (PM.N) in tobacco-heating products. However, Investec analysts believe BAT’s “glo” device is at least as attractive as Philip Morris’s iQOS, and should be able to steal meaningful market share over the medium-term.  BAT’s shares were up 1 percent at 0915 GMT.  Philip Morris’s lead in tobacco-heating had given its stock a premium over rivals, but its shares have fallen 19 percent since last week, when it said uptake of iQOS in Japan, its biggest market, was slowing. It blamed older smokers, who were proving less eager to switch than younger early adopters.   The sell-off, which also pulled down shares of BAT and Imperial Brands (IMB.L), highlighted “the uncertainty that tobacco companies and investors face around a successful and profitable shift to reduced-risk next generation products,” Liberum analysts said.  What is more, Big Tobacco faces a fierce new U.S. competitor called Juul Labs Inc, whose discreet e-cigarette has taking a  chunk of the vaping market. The palm-sized device is particularly popular among teenagers, prompting worry among parents and health experts.  On Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it had launched a crackdown on vaping devices sold to minors, particularly those made by Juul. It has also sparked concern for investors in Big Tobacco.  “That brand came from nowhere, so that has led people to worry that maybe barriers to entry are less than we all thought,” UBS analyst Nik Oliver said this week.  “Saying that, BAT in particular has a very exciting pipeline ... so I think they’ve got the tools to respond quite well, but in the short term, Juul got there first.”  Earlier this month, BAT, the maker of Dunhill and Lucky Strike cigarettes, told Reuters it planned to start testing in late 2018 a new version of its Vype line of e-cigarettes called the Raptor, which produces a stronger nicotine punch than existing products. The company did not say which markets would see the test. BAT also plans to test a carbon-tipped tobacco heating product called “neocores” this year, and to introduce its “ePen3” e-cigarette in the third quarter. The latter is in limited  distribution in Britain at the moment, but has not been officially launched.  Philip Morris and Imperial Brands also have new devices in the works. BAT reiterated on Wednesday it aims to more than double revenue from next-generation products to well above 1 billion pounds this year. It also repeated its forecast for a hit from adverse exchange rate moves this year.
