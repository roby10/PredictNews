1,GILD,Once-daily AIDS pill can slash HIV infection risk,"LONDON (Reuters) - AIDS drugs designed to treat HIV can also be used to reduce dramatically the risk of infection among heterosexual couples, two studies conducted in Africa showed for the first time on Wednesday.  The findings add to growing evidence that the type of medicines prescribed since the mid-1990s to treat people who are already sick may also hold the key to slowing or even halting the spread of the sexually transmitted disease.  The research involving couples in Kenya, Uganda and Botswana found that daily AIDS drugs reduced infection rates by an average of at least 62 percent when compared with placebo.  “Effective new HIV prevention tools are urgently needed and these studies could have enormous impact in preventing heterosexual transmission,” Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), said in a statement.  She said the United Nations health agency would now work with countries to use the new findings to implement better protection strategies.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention plans to review the data and issue its own guidelines — taking into account issues such as whether behavior may change when people know they are taking a drug that reduces infection risk, said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, CDC director HIV/AIDS prevention.  In its first official guidance on the topic, the CDC said in January that only high-risk gay and bisexual men should use a daily AIDS pill to protect themselves from the virus.  The larger of the two new studies examined 4,758 “discordant” couples in Kenya and Uganda in which one partner was HIV-positive and one was negative. Those negative partners taking Gilead Sciences Inc’s tenofovir, or Viread, had on average 62 percent fewer infections.  For couples on Truvada — another Gilead drug combining tenofovir and emtricitabine — the infection risk was cut by an estimated 73 percent in the clinical trial, which was led by researchers at the University of Washington.  Dr. Jared Baeten, principal investigator of the study funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said real-life application of the results has not been determined. But Baetennoted that “discordant” couples who want to have children may now have an alternative to condoms.  The second study, involving just over 1,200 sexually active men and women in Botswana, found those on daily Truvada reduced their risk of HIV infection by 62.6 percent.  Lead investigator, Dr. Michael Thigpen, said Truvada proved to be safe and effective. He said the drug — along with things like male circumcision, topical microbicide gels and condoms — could be another tool for preventing the spread of HIV.  The idea of such “pre-exposure prophylaxis,” known as PrEP, has gained traction in the past year, following results of other research showing a fall in infection rates among gay men taking AIDS drugs.  However, PrEP took a knock earlier this year when another study failed to demonstrate a protective effect in high-risk women. The latest strong evidence is likely to restore confidence in the approach.  Around 33 million people worldwide have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, most living in Africa and Asia. Only about half know their HIV status, and the WHO hopes that news of an effective approach to prevention will encourage more people to get tested.  Michel Sidibe, head of the UN’s program on HIV/AIDS, said the new studies “could help us to reach the tipping point in the HIV epidemic.”  The larger study, conducted in Kenya and Uganda, had been scheduled to run until late 2012 but its placebo arm was stopped early because the evidence of efficacy was so strong.  Results of the Botswana study, led by the CDC, had been due to be unveiled next week at an international AIDS congress in Rome but were released ahead of time to coincide with the University of Washington research.  AIDS drugs are available as generics in many poor countries at prices as low as 25 U.S. cents a tablet, according to the WHO. Prices could fall further and supplies increase following an agreement by Gilead, the leading maker of HIV drugs, to share intellectual property rights on its medicines in a new patent pool. The California-based group Tuesday became the first drugmaker to sign up to the Medicines Patent Pool.

3,GILD,UPDATE 1-Bristol Myers Squibb to buy Amira Pharma for $325 mln," * Says could get potential milestone payments of $150 mln   * Says to secure Amira’s fibrosis and autotaxin programs   July 21 (Reuters) - Biopharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) said it would buy privately held Amira Pharmaceuticals for $325 million in cash to expand its drug offerings to patients with fibrotic diseases.   Under the deal, Bristol-Myers will secure Amira’s fibrosis program and autotaxin program, the company said.   Bristol-Myers also said it could potentially secure $150 million in milestone payments.   Amira Pharmaceuticals is a small-molecule pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and early development of new drugs to treat inflammatory and fibrotic diseases.   Bristol-Myers Squibb was represented by Covington & Burling LLP, while Amira Pharmaceuticals’ financial advisor for the transaction was J.P. Morgan Securities LLC.   In December last year Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) said it would buy privately held biotechnology firm Arresto Biosciences for $225 million to expand its fibrotic diseases pipeline.

Sales of Atripla, which combines Gilead’s Truvada with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s (BMY.N) Sustiva into a single pill, rose 15 percent to $822 million, topping analysts’ forecasts of between $810 million and $812 million.   Sales of Truvada rose 11 percent to $711.3 million, also exceeding Wall Street estimates of about $708 million.   First-quarter sales of the two drugs had missed analysts’ estimates as they were hit by temporary cutbacks in state-funded AIDS drug assistance programs in Florida and Texas.   Gilead is expected to unveil key data on its Quad HIV pill later this quarter and said it plans to file its application seeking U.S. approval in the first quarter of 2012.   Quad, which will combine four medicines, is considered to be Gilead’s most important future growth driver by many analysts.   The company said it is also planning to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to amend the Truvada label to include data from recent studies showing the drug can help prevent new HIV infections.   The world’s top maker of HIV medicines posted net profit of $746.2 million, or 93 cents per share, compared with a profit of $712.1 million, or 79 cents per share, a year ago.   Excluding special items, Gilead earned $1.00 per share, beating analysts’ average expectations by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   “The sales were a little bit above consensus and our estimates,” said Cowen and Co analyst Philip Nadeau, calling the results “solid.”   “It looks like business did bounce back from the first quarter,” he said.   The company maintained the full-year forecast it provided earlier this year for product sales of $7.9 billion to $8.1 billion.   Total revenue for the quarter rose to $2.14 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates of $2.07 billion.   Revenue from royalties and collaboration fell 19 percent to $97.7 million, primarily due to a drop in royalties from Roche Holding AG ROG.VX for its Tamiflu flu treatment. Tamiflu sales have been lower as fears and flu pandemic preparation subsided from a year ago.   Gilead shares were relatively unchanged in extended trading, slipping 3 cents to $42.13 from their Nasdaq close at $42.16.

5,GILD,Actelion drug cuts brain lesions in MS patients,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Actelion’s experimental multiple sclerosis drug ponesimod met its main goal in a mid-stage trial, giving the Swiss biotech’s pipeline a much-needed boost.  Actelion has had a bumpy ride after a string of product setbacks last year, and it has faced tough criticism from its main shareholder Elliott Advisors, which urged the group to consider putting itself up for sale.  Europe’s largest pure-play biotech group said on Tuesday its selective S1P1 receptor agonist, ponesimod, cut the number of new active inflammatory lesions in the brain in a Phase IIb dose-finding study in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  At 0856 GMT, Actelion shares were down 0.3 percent, outperforming a 1.2 percent drop in the European healthcare index.  “The product, assuming competitive efficacy, has a profile that would position it well in the market and as such we believe it has blockbuster potential,” Nomura analyst Samir Devani said.  Actelion said 464 patients were enrolled, making this the largest ever dose-finding study conducted in this autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system.  Actelion said it would now move ponesimod to the final stage of clinical development, and analysts at Jefferies said the mid-stage data could pave the way for a partnership deal.  “Given the number of emerging oral MS drugs, together with Actelion’s relative inexperience conducting large pivotal CNS trials and finite financial resources, we believe a partnership deal for ponesimod could be announced within the next 6-12 months now that the Phase IIb data are in-house,” the Jefferies analysts said.  Novartis has seen strong demand for its recently launched its MS pill Gilenya, which rivals older treatments such as Biogen Idec’s Tysabri.  Biogen is now developing its own oral MS drug, BG-12, which, if approved, could help it to take the lead in the oral MS drug market. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries is also developing experimental pill laquinimod.  Actelion is trying to cut its dependence on key drug Tracleer, which treats a rare heart and lung disorder and rakes in more than $1 billion a year, but is now starting to face competition from Gilead Sciences’ Letairis.  Investors are now awaiting data from a phase II trial of macitentan in lung fibrosis for more insight into its safety profile. Macitentan is being billed as Tracleer’s successor, and results of a late-stage study in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are due in the first half of 2012.

6,GILD,FDA approves Gilead's once-daily HIV pill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Regulators approved a once-daily HIV pill by Gilead Sciences Inc, giving a new source of revenue to the leading maker of HIV medicines as it faces expiring patents.  The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday gave a nod to the pill Complera for patients who have not received prior treatment for the virus that causes AIDS. The $1,705-a-month drug combines Gilead’s Truvada with Johnson & Johnson’s Edurant, which received FDA approval in May.  Gilead currently sells another once-daily pill, Atripla, that combines Truvada with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Sustiva, but the California drugmaker earns no profit from the Bristol drug and all of the Atripla components lose patent protection in the next few years.  Under the deal with J&J, Gilead would keep up to 30 percent of what it will make off the Edurant component in Complera.  The company’s sales of AIDS drugs have benefited from new U.S. health guidelines calling for wider screening for the disease and its earlier treatment, but the magnitude of growth has slowed and the company is under pressure to bring new drugs to the market.  U.S. regulators first rejected Gilead’s application for Complera in January, citing insufficient information.  Shares of Gilead rose 2.6 percent to $36.26 on Wednesday in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq after closing at $35.34.  Also on Wednesday, the company said it has resolved all issues raised in an FDA warning letter from September. The FDA at the time raised concerns about manufacturing problems and product quality at a San Dimas, California, plant where Gilead makes many of its drugs.  Now, the company’s response and actions have “sufficiently addressed” FDA’s concerns, Gilead said.  Gilead last month became the first drugmaker to sign up for a new patent pool, where it plans to share intellectual property rights on its medicines with a goal of making treatments more widely available to the poor.

8,GILD,Gilead's HIV pill shows positive results in trial,"BANGALORE (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc said its four-medicine HIV pill, known as the Quad, worked as well as the company’s widely used Atripla three-drug tablet in a late-stage trial.  In the trial, 88 percent of patients taking the Quad achieved reductions in levels of HIV in the blood, known as viral load, compared with 84 percent of those who received Atripla.  The HIV drug maker’s shares fell 3 percent to $36.26 in early trade on Monday on Nasdaq.  “Seems like the market is reacting because the company did not release enough data on the trial so it can have something to announce when it presents the data at a scientific conference,” BWS Financial analyst Hamed Khorsand said.  The company said discontinuation rates due to adverse events were comparable in both arms of the study.  “There are definitely questions as to why there are discontinuations, but they are not providing anymore reasons,” Khorsand added.  The Quad — a combination of elvitegravir, an investigational integrase inhibitor, cobicistat or “boosting” agent and Truvada — is a complete once-daily, single-tablet regimen.  Gilead said it plans to seek approval for the Quad in the first quarter of 2012.  The late-stage trial for the drug includes two studies which are evaluating it versus a standard of care among HIV-1 infected adults, the company said.

9,GILD,PREVIEW-Lofty hopes confront Gilead's 4-drug HIV pill," * Key trial results expected this month   * May need to show superiority to rivals to boost stock   * Sales forecasts vary widely   By Deena Beasley   LOS ANGELES, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc’s (GILD.O) experimental four-drug HIV pill may need to do more than simply match the safety and effectiveness of existing therapies to meet its lofty sales expectations.   Results for the second pivotal clinical trial for the combination drug are expected this month. The pill is likely to meet the study’s goal of working as well as a combination of other medicines, analysts said, but it may need to show superiority to convince investors of its commercial potential and send Gilead shares higher.   The biotechnology company said in August that its first pivotal trial of the pill, known as the Quad, met the goal of showing that it worked as well as Atripla, Gilead’s current three-drug combination HIV pill.   But shares of the Foster City, California-based company fell as much as 3 percent after the news and the stock has dropped more than 10 percent over the past seven weeks.   “There were some investors who were hoping the trial would show superiority to Atripla,” said Needham & Co analyst Alan Carr.   The Quad is seen as Gilead’s most important pipeline product — all of the components are owned by the company, and the Quad would extend the life of the company’s lucrative HIV franchise.   As of early 2011, about 80 percent of U.S. HIV patients and 72 percent of European HIV patients were treated with a Gilead drug. Combination drugs are particularly important for HIV patients, who must juggle a huge amount of pills on a daily basis.   The Quad combines experimental integrase inhibitor elvitegravir and boosting agent cobicistat with Truvada, a pill consisting of Gilead’s older HIV drugs Emtriva and Viread.   Most of the company’s current drug sales — which totaled $7.4 billion last year — come from Atripla, a once-daily pill that combines Truvada with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY.N) Sustiva.   Gilead earns no profit from the Bristol drug, and all of the Atripla components lose patent protection in the next few years.   The second pivotal trial of the Quad is designed to show that it works as well as a combination of ritonavir-boosted Reyataz, a protease inhibitor sold by Bristol-Myers, and Truvada.   RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee puts the odds that the Quad will show superiority to the Reyataz regimen at 25 percent.   A lower-cost generic version of Atripla could be on the market in 2018, and Gilead will need a compelling case to convince doctors that the Quad will benefit patients more than existing HIV drugs.   If approved, the Quad would be the first single-tablet regimen for HIV to include an integrase inhibitor — a new class of drugs designed to block the ability of the human immunodeficiency virus to replicate.   The four-drug pill is also seen as potentially safer than Atripla, but Gilead said initial results from the first pivotal trial showed similar rates of adverse side effects and patient drop-out rates for both treatment groups.   Full safety data from the first trial will be presented at a medical conference in March, and Gilead plans to file for U.S. regulatory approval of the Quad in the first quarter of 2012.   U.S. regulators last month approved Gilead’s Complera, a  three-drug combination of Emtriva, Viread and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) Edurant. Under its deal with J&J, Gilead will keep up to 30 percent of what it makes off the Edurant component.   Analysts expect Gilead’s Complera sales to reach $916 million by 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data. Sales of the Quad are forecast as high as $1.53 billion by 2015, but estimates vary widely.   “While Gilead remains the dominant market leader in HIV ... we believe the overall market trends are slowing and that trends toward earlier treatment have been close to fully realized,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Jim Birchenough said in a research note this week.   He forecasts 2015 Quad sales of just $367.3 million.   Gilead licensed elvitegravir from Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) in March 2005. The U.S. company has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the drug everywhere except Japan.   Currently, the only integrase inhibitor approved by regulators is Merck & Co Inc’s (MRK.N) Isentress, or raltegravir, but it must be taken twice a day.   ViiV Healthcare, a joint venture between GlaxoSmithkline Plc (GSK.L) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), is testing a combination of experimental integrase inhibitor dolutegravir and Epzicom, which consists of HIV drugs Ziagen and Epivir.   Yee at RBC Capital Markets said the Glaxo drug could be competition for the Quad, but noted that dolutegravir will not be co-formulated with Truvada.   He also said Epzicom use is associated with higher cardiovascular risks.

10,GILD,Sangamo gene therapy shows promise in reducing HIV,"(Reuters) - An early stage trial of Sangamo BioSciences Inc’s HIV treatment found that the gene therapy reduced levels of the virus and even eliminated it in one patient with a naturally occurring gene mutation.  The very small Phase 1 trial tested the SB-728-T gene therapy, which is designed to disrupt the CCR5 gene used by HIV to infect cells of the immune system.  If shown to be safe and effective, the treatment could end the need for the antiretroviral drugs now used to keep the virus that causes AIDS in check by suppressing viral replication in the blood.  Trial results presented in Chicago on Sunday at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy show a “statistically significant relationship between estimated modification of both copies of the CCR5 gene and viral load,” said Dr. Carl June, trial investigator and director of translational research at the University of Pennsylvania’s cancer research institute.  In a statement, June said the results suggest the need to increase the frequency of the modified cells in HIV-infected patients, which could lead to a “functional cure” for AIDS, but the means of achieving this have not been clarified.  Sangamo said earlier this year that a single infusion of the treatment improved immune system damage in nearly all of the subjects analyzed in the first trial of the therapy in humans.  The 10 patients in the trial were on antiretroviral therapy when the study began. After four weeks, six of them went on a “treatment interruption,” during which they stopped taking antiviral medication for 12 weeks.  Viral load decreased in three of the six subjects, with one patient’s viral load reduced to undetectable levels. That patient carried a naturally occurring mutation in one copy of his CCR5 gene.  Humans contain two copies of each gene, one from the father and one from the mother, which sometimes are referred to as the alleles of a gene.  “Since one copy of his gene was already disrupted naturally, twice as many of his cells were ‘biallelically’ modified,” Sangamo Chief Executive Officer Edward Lanphier said in a telephone interview, meaning that both members of the CCR5 gene pair were knocked out.  He estimated that between 5 percent and 10 percent of HIV patients carry the genetic mutation.  Around 33 million people worldwide have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Major producers of current HIV drugs include Gilead Sciences and GlaxoSmithKline.  Lanphier said Sangamo will move ahead with a strategy to maximize the number of cells that can be “biallelically” modified by SB-728-T. Options include targeting only the small segment of patients with mutated CCR5 genes or using “strategies that boost the amount of engraftment of modified cells.”  The CEO said he plans to unveil details of Sangamo’s plans at an investment banking conference in New York on Wednesday.  Lanphier emphasized that the company intends to take the HIV treatment into mid-stage trials without a partner.  “We have more than sufficient cash to push forward into Phase 2 trials,” he said, reaffirming that Sangamo expects to have cash holdings of at least $85 million at year-end.

In a statement, June said the results suggest the need to increase the frequency of the modified cells in HIV-infected patients, which could lead to a “functional cure” for AIDS, but the means of achieving this have not been clarified.   Sangamo said earlier this year that a single infusion of the treatment improved immune system damage in nearly all of the subjects analyzed in the first trial of the therapy in humans.   The 10 patients in the trial were on antiretroviral therapy when the study began. After four weeks, six of them went on a “treatment interruption,” during which they stopped taking antiviral medication for 12 weeks.   Viral load decreased in three of the six subjects, with one patient’s viral load reduced to undetectable levels. That patient carried a naturally occurring mutation in one copy of his CCR5 gene.   Humans contain two copies of each gene, one from the father and one from the mother, which sometimes are referred to as the alleles of a gene.   “Since one copy of his gene was already disrupted naturally, twice as many of his cells were ‘biallelically’ modified,” Sangamo Chief Executive Officer Edward Lanphier said in a telephone interview, meaning that both members of the CCR5 gene pair were knocked out.   He estimated that between 5 percent and 10 percent of HIV patients carry the genetic mutation.   Around 33 million people worldwide have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. Major producers of current HIV drugs include Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L).   Lanphier said Sangamo will move ahead with a strategy to maximize the number of cells that can be “biallelically” modified by SB-728-T. Options include targeting only the small segment of patients with mutated CCR5 genes or using “strategies that boost the amount of engraftment of modified cells.”   The CEO said he plans to unveil details of Sangamo’s plans at an investment banking conference in New York on Wednesday.   Lanphier emphasized that the company intends to take the HIV treatment into mid-stage trials without a partner.   “We have more than sufficient cash to push forward into Phase 2 trials,” he said, reaffirming that Sangamo expects to have cash holdings of at least $85 million at year-end.

12,GILD,UPDATE 3-Gilead's 2nd trial of 4-drug AIDS pill meets goal,"   * 90 pct of Quad patients achieved target viral load  * More patients on Reyataz dropped out of the trial  * U.S. FDA filing planned by end of year  * Shares close down 0.9 percent  (Adds analyst comment, background)   Sept 19 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc’s (GILD.O) four-drug experimental HIV pill worked as well as a regimen containing protease inhibitor Reyataz in the second pivotal trial of the drug, the company said on Monday.   But while the trial succeeded, it did not show that the experimental pill, called the Quad, was superior to the Reyataz regimen and Gilead shares fell about 0.9 percent.   “Overall the data are good ... mostly in line with investor expectations,” said Cowen and Co analyst Philip Nadeau.   “I think there might have been a little bit of expectation for statistical superiority, but only from a few outliers.”   The trial found that 90 percent of patients taking the Gilead drug achieved target levels of HIV in the blood, or viral load, compared with 87 percent of patients on ritonavir-boosted Reyataz, which is sold by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N).   The four-drug pill — which combines experimental integrase inhibitor elvitegravir and boosting agent cobicistat with Truvada, a pill consisting of Gilead’s older HIV drugs Emtriva and Viread — is seen as the biotechnology company’s most important pipeline product.   “While Quad may become the drug of choice for new patients, we see limited impetus for switching well-controlled patients ... and as such view the Quad as a modest mitigant of generic risk emerging between 2017 to 2021,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Jim Birchenough said in a research note, referring to the years when key Gilead patents will expire.   The most bullish sales estimates for the Quad assume that it will be prescribed for both newly diagnosed and existing HIV patients.   Wall Street analysts, on average, have forecast Quad sales of $1.53 billion by 2015, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Gilead said 5.1 percent of Reyataz patients dropped out of the trial, mainly due to elevated bilirubin levels, compared with a drop-out rate of 3.1 percent for patients treated with the Quad pill.   The company said it planned to file for U.S. regulatory approval of the Quad by the end of this year — earlier than its previous estimate of a filing in the first quarter of 2012.   Gilead Chief Operating Officer John Milligan, speaking on a conference call, said the company would request a “priority review” by the Food and Drug Administration, which could clear the way for an approval as early as mid-year 2012.   The company said last month that its other Phase 3 trial of the Quad showed that the pill worked as well as Atripla, Gilead’s currently marketed three-drug HIV pill.   The company’s shares, which closed at $40.05 on Nasdaq, were trading at $39.81 after hours.

14,GILD,"Scientists find way to ""disarm"" AIDS virus","LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have found a way to prevent HIV from damaging the immune system and say their discovery may offer a new approach to developing a vaccine against AIDS.  Researchers from the United States and Europe working in laboratories on the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) found it is unable to damage the immune system if cholesterol is removed from the virus’s membrane.  “It’s like an army that has lost its weapons but still has flags, so another army can recognize it and attack it,” said Adriano Boasso of Imperial College London, who led the study.  The team now plans to investigate how to use this way of inactivating the virus and possibly develop it into a vaccine.  Usually when a person becomes infected with HIV, the body’s innate immune response puts up an immediate defense. But some researchers believe HIV causes the innate immune system to overreact. This weakens the immune system’s next line of defense, known as the adaptive immune response.  For this study — published on Monday in the journal Blood — Boasso’s team removed cholesterol from the membrane around the virus and found that this stopped HIV from triggering the innate immune response. This in turn led to a stronger adaptive response, orchestrated by a type of immune cells called T cells.  AIDS kills around 1.8 million people a year worldwide. An estimated 2.6 million people caught HIV in 2009, and 33.3 million people are living with the virus.  Major producers of current HIV drugs include Gilead Bristol Myers Squibb, Merck, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline.  Scientists from companies, non-profits and governments around the world have been trying for many years to make a vaccine against HIV but have so far had only limited success.  A 2009 study in Thailand involving 16,000 volunteers showed for the first time that a vaccine could prevent HIV infection in a small number of people, but since the efficacy was only around 30 percent researchers were forced back to the drawing board.  An American team working on an experimental HIV vaccine said in May that it helped monkeys with a form of the AIDS virus control the infection for more than a year, suggesting it may lead to a vaccine for people.  HIV is spread in many ways — during sex, on needles shared by drug users, in breast milk and in blood — so there is no single easy way to prevent infection. The virus also mutates quickly and can hide from the immune system, and attacks the very cells sent to battle it.  “HIV is very sneaky,” Boasso said in a statement. “It evades the host’s defenses by triggering overblown responses that damage the immune system. It’s like revving your car in first gear for too long — eventually the engine blows out.  He said this may be why developing a vaccine has proven so tricky. “Most vaccines prime the adaptive response to recognize the invader, but it’s hard for this to work if the virus triggers other mechanisms that weaken the adaptive response.”  HIV takes its membrane from the cell that it infects, the researchers explained in their study. This membrane contains cholesterol, which helps keep it fluid and enables it to interact with particular types of cell.  Normally, a subset of immune cells called plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) recognize HIV quickly and react by producing signaling molecules called interferons. These signals activate various processes which are initially helpful, but which damage the immune system if switched on for too long.  Working with scientists Johns Hopkins University, the University of Milan and Innsbruck University, Boasso’s team found that if cholesterol is removed from HIV’s envelope, it can no longer activate pDCs. As a result, T cells, which orchestrate the adaptive response, can fight the virus more effectively.",9192011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aids-hiv-disarm/scientists-find-way-to-disarm-aids-virus-idUSTRE78I5O820110919
15,GILD,Gilead bets $11 billion on hepatitis in Pharmasset deal,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) struck a deal to buy biotechnology company Pharmasset Inc VRUS.O for about $11 billion in a huge and risky bet on the next generation of hepatitis C treatments. Gilead, the world’s largest maker of HIV drugs, will pay $137 per share for each Pharmasset share, an 89 percent premium for a company with no significant marketed products. Pharmasset shares had already more than tripled in the past year based on the potential of its experimental hepatitis C medicines to create a new standard of care for the 180 million people worldwide infected with the serious liver disease. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc (VRTX.O) and Merck & Co (MRK.N) won approval this year for hepatitis C medicines that stand to significantly increase cure rates, but they must be taken with commercially manufactured interferon. Interferons are proteins that help the body’s immune system respond to viruses, but they often cause flu-like side effects that lead many hepatitis C patients to stop or delay treatment. The oral treatments being developed by Pharmasset and other companies such as Abbott Laboratories Inc (ABT.N) could eliminate the need for interferon if they are approved in the next few years. Pharmasset soared 84.6 percent to $134.14 on the Nasdaq. Shares of Gilead, which said the deal would reduce its earnings through 2014, fell 9.1 percent to $36.26, also on the Nasdaq. Analysts questioned whether the deal price — equal to more than one-third of Gilead’s market value — was too steep. A Wall Street survey conducted by ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum after the deal was announced found that 82 percent thought Gilead paid too much. “It’s definitely a high-risk acquisition, but I think it could pay off in dividends for them,” said Brian Skorney, an analyst with Brean Murray, Carret & Co. “Given the premium, Gilead is hoping to avoid another potential suitor.” Skorney said a competing bid could emerge. He noted that Roche Holding AG ROG.VX has a partnership with Pharmasset. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and Merck also sell or are developing hepatitis medicines. Shares of Inhibitex Inc INHX.O, which also is developing hepatitis C medicines, gained 18.8 percent. Untreated, hepatitis C can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and the need for a liver transplant. According to Gilead, more than 12 million people are infected with hepatitis C in major markets, but fewer than 200,000 are treated annually. The market for hepatitis C drugs is expected to soar to $16 billion in 2015 from $1.7 billion last year in major commercial markets, according to research firm Decision Resources. It estimates the market will then fall to $11.3 billion in 2020, because many patients will have been cured by the new drugs, reducing the number of people who need treatment. Vertex recorded enormous initial sales of its new drug, Incivek, but its shares have fallen on expectations that new treatments, such as Pharmasset’s, may soon overtake it. Vertex shares fell 2.6 percent on Monday. Among the big Pharmasset investors set to profit are investment fund company Fidelity, biotech investing firm Burrill & Co and Pharmasset founder Raymond Schinazi, who holds 4.4 percent of the company, according to Thomson Reuters data. Gilead, which had a market value of about $30 billion before Monday’s trading, has developed a lucrative HIV franchise by combining several drugs into single pills. HIV patients must otherwise juggle multiple pills a day and risk developing AIDS if they fail to stick to their medicines. Investors are concerned about looming generic competition to its products. Gilead is counting on a four-drug pill, known as the Quad, to propel the franchise in the future. Pharmasset, which had 82 employees as of its most recent annual report, has three hepatitis C medicines in clinical trials. Its lead candidate, PSI-7977, was recently advanced into two Phase III studies. Gilead expects PSI-7977 to be submitted for U.S. approval in the second half of 2013. Gilead Chief Executive John Martin said on a call with analysts that Pharmasset’s experimental drugs, combined with Gilead’s own hepatitis C portfolio, would allow the company to test multiple regimens that are oral and interferon-free. In justifying the high premium, Gilead said PSI-7977 will be more valuable in its hands because it has the infrastructure to bring the product to more people faster than Pharmasset. But Leerink Swann analyst Joshua Schimmer said “the need to buy into the (hepatitis C) market with such a big price tag makes us question Gilead’s core development capabilities in this space.” Gilead said the deal would hurt its earnings through 2014 but boost them after that. It expects to close the acquisition in the first quarter of 2012 and will temporarily suspend its share repurchase program to focus on paying down debt. The agreement carries a standard break-up fee, about 3 percent of the total deal value, a source close to the situation said. It said it would finance the deal with cash on hand, bank debt and senior unsecured notes and has financing commitments from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays Capital. The Barclays and Bank of America advised Gilead on the deal, while Morgan Stanley advised Pharmasset.

A U.S. congressional committee was expected to concede defeat in its bid to lower the deficit, renewing the debate over taxes and spending at a time when the impending expiration of payroll tax breaks and jobless benefits could undermine the economy. In addition, Moody’s said a recent rise in interest rates on French government debt and weaker economic growth prospects could be negative for the country’s credit rating. The committee’s co-chairs will issue a statement later Monday, according to sources, declaring the bipartisan committee was unable to reach a deficit-reduction deal because of deep divides over taxes and spending. The developments create further headwinds for an already volatile market, and could extend the previous week’s losses, which was the worst for the S&P; in two months. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 2.1 percent. In addition to the new concerns about France, Spanish prime minister-elect Mariano Rajoy was under pressure to details his policies to overcome a severe economic crisis after his center-right party won the country’s biggest election victory in 30 years. Adding to market jitters, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan warned the global economy was in a grim state. “It isn’t just the failure of the committee that’s causing investors to shun risk around the world, although I thought we would get some kind of last-minute deal,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. “Between the continued concerns about Europe, especially France now, and the comments out of China, there are just so many ongoing problems.” S&P; 500 futures fell 17.8 points and were below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures lost 154 points and Nasdaq 100 futures sank 23.25 points. Trading volume is expected to be light this week due to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. The light action could add to market volatility. The S&P; failed to rise above 1,225 on Friday after a drop below it on Thursday triggered massive selling, and that level is now strengthening as technical resistance. Last week, the Dow fell 2.9 percent, the S&P; dropped 3.8 percent, and the Nasdaq lost 4 percent.

20,GILD,More patients relapse in Gilead hepatitis C trial,"(Reuters) - Two more patients in a 10-patient segment of a mid-stage trial testing Gilead Sciences Inc’s experimental hepatitis C drug GS-7977 had the virus return within four weeks of treatment, researchers said on Tuesday. The company, which recently paid nearly $11 billion to acquire the drug and its developer, Pharmasset, said last month that six out of 10 patients with a prior “null response” to standard hepatitis C therapy saw the virus return within four weeks of treatment with a combination of GS-7977 and the antiviral drug ribavirin. The latest results from the mid-stage trial bring to eight the number of patients who have relapsed. One patient has not reached the four-week point and the other showed a response to the drug, Dr. Edward Gane from New Zealand’s Auckland City Hospital and the study’s lead investigator said here at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. The trial segment he updated involved patients infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C — the most common, but also the most difficult to treat, subset of the disease. “The majority of null responders have relapsed post treatment,” Dr. Gane said, adding that such patients will likely need either a longer duration of therapy or combination treatment with other direct-acting antiviral agents. He said the relapsed patients will be offered a “rescue protocol” in the form of another trial of GS-7977 in combination with a different experimental drug. Shares of Gilead have dropped 18 percent since the company’s announcement of the trial results, which suggested that an all-oral treatment for hepatitis C may be further away than many had hoped. Dr. Gane said ongoing pivotal-stage trials of GS-7977 “should establish that interferon-free treatment is not a dream. It’s a reality that should be here within the next five years.” Current hepatitis C drug regimens require injections of interferon, which causes severe flu-like symptoms and cannot be tolerated by some patients. GS-7977 is designed to block an enzyme essential to the replication of the hepatitis C virus. It is one of a new class of treatments designed to be given without injections of interferon, which helps boost the body’s immune system but can also cause debilitating flu-like side effects. Gilead has said it expects to announce at the end of this month results from a mid-stage trial of GS-7977 in previously untreated hepatitis C patients. Hepatitis C is a liver-destroying disease that affects some 170 million people worldwide. Untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and the need for a liver transplant.",3062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hepc/more-patients-relapse-in-gilead-hepatitis-c-trial-idUSTRE8251RS20120306
21,GILD,Gilead Quad HIV drug causes fewer side effects,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Full details from a pivotal trial of Gilead Sciences Inc experimental Quad HIV pill show that it caused fewer adverse side effects than the company’s current three-drug pill, Atripla. Gilead said last year that the trial had met its goal of showing that the four-drug Quad worked as well as Atripla in controlling levels of the virus that causes AIDS. The safety data, presented here on Wednesday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, showed that patients on Atripla had significantly higher rates of dizziness, abnormal dreams, insomnia and rash, compared with the Quad. The experimental pill did result in higher rates of nausea, 21 percent vs 14 percent. The study found that at 48 weeks of treatment, 88 percent of Quad patients, compared with 84 percent of Atripla patients, achieved target levels of HIV virus. Discontinuation rates were similar for both arms of the study, said Dr. Paul Sax, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and the study’s lead investigator. He said 1.4 percent of patients in the Quad group dropped out due to kidney abnormalities, while 1.4 percent of the Atripla group discontinued due to rash. Dr. Sax said the median level of serum creatinine increase — a measure of renal toxicity — was 0.14 milligrams per deciliter for the Quad arm of the study, which was below the level of 0.4 mg/dL which would have been a safety concern. On the issue of whether it would make sense to eventually switch patients from Atripla to the Quad, he said “it looks like a switch would be virologically safe and maybe associated with fewer central nervous system side effects.” The Quad is seen as key to Gilead’s continued dominance of the market for HIV drugs. It combines experimental integrase inhibitor elvitegravir and boosting agent cobicistat with Truvada, a pill consisting of Gilead’s older HIV drugs Emtriva and Viread. Most of the company’s current drug sales, which totaled $8.1 billion last year, come from Atripla, a once-daily pill that combines Truvada with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Sustiva. With the Quad, which is currently under review by U.S. regulators, Gilead owns all of the components. Full results from another successful trial comparing the Quad to a combination of ritonavir-boosted Reyataz, a protease inhibitor sold by Bristol-Myers, and Truvada, will be presented at the Seattle conference on Thursday. The Food and Drug Administration is due to decide by August 27 whether to approve the four-drug HIV pill.

24,GILD,"Gilead, Bristol hepatitis C trial data impresses","(Reuters) - A combination of experimental hepatitis C drugs from Gilead Sciences Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co showed impressive results in new clinical trial data released on Thursday, helping fuel an 11 percent rise in Gilead shares. Gilead’s GS-7977, acquired with its $11 billion purchase of Pharmasset, when combined with Bristol’s daclatasvir led to a 100 percent response rate in previously untreated patients with the most common form of hepatitis C, according to interim data from a mid-stage trial presented at a liver disease meeting in Europe. The results were accomplished without interferon, an injected drug that causes flu-like symptoms and other side effects that often lead patients to discontinue or delay treatment, or ribavirin, an older antiviral drug that is also currently part of all treatment regimens. “This reinforces that ‘7977 is the best asset in the hep C space and restores ‘world order’ with Gilead ... as the one to beat,” Thomas Russo, analyst at Robert W. Baird, said in a research note. Bristol’s daclatasvir is from a new class of drugs known as NS5A inhibitors. GS-7977 is a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor. Both are designed to block enzymes essential to replication of the hepatitis C virus. But Gilead may seek to go it alone with an interferon-free treatment. Bristol said Gilead had balked at further collaboration on the combination under study, which began when 7977 was owned by Pharmasset. Given the impressive data, said Bristol-Myers spokeswoman Cristi Barnett, “we were interested in a Phase III collaboration. Unfortunately Gilead was not interested.” Gilead declined to comment on future development plans, saying that it is looking at many options. Gilead is commencing a trial of 7977 in combination with its own experimental NS5A inhibitor, while Bristol-Myers is testing daclatasvir with a drug similar to 7977 that it acquired with its $2.5 billion purchase of Inhibitex, as well as with other experimental drugs in its development pipeline. The market for treating hepatitis C has burgeoned in the last year as two new treatments were approved for use and clinical trials of all-oral medicines demonstrate promising results. The liver-destroying virus is estimated to infect up to 170 million people worldwide. “It’s clear that Gilead, Bristol-Myers and Abbott are among the leaders, and that current players, including Merck, are lagging and appear to be losing ground in this pursuit,” Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan said in a research note. Abbott Laboratories earlier this month released impressive data from a small mid-stage trial combining its experimental protease inhibitor ABT-450 boosted by the antiviral drug ritonavir, along with a polymerase inhibitor and ribavirin. The combination achieved a 95 percent cure rate in one arm of the study, but Abbott shares were down nearly 2 percent on Thursday. Bristol shares were up more than 1 percent, while shares of Idenix Pharmaceuticals, which is developing drug in the same class as Bristol’s and Gilead’s, were down slightly. Shares of Achillion Pharmaceuticals fell 15 percent after a downgrade to “sell” from UBS Investment. UBS analyst Matthew Harrison said the “strategic value” of Achillion’s hepatitis C drug candidates — including its once-a-day protease inhibitor — is now “substantially lower.” Separately, Gilead reported results from the Electron study, showing that of 88 percent of the 25 patients with genotype 1 hepatitis who completed 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 and ribavirin, had undetectable levels of virus four weeks after completion of treatment. Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at ISI Group, said the ELECTRON data was better than expected, since most analysts had expected a result around 50 percent. BRISTOL, GILEAD DRUGS WELL-TOLERATED In the Bristol-Gilead study, all 44 of the patients who had the most common and difficult to treat Genotype 1 version of the disease had undetectable levels of the virus in their blood four weeks after completing treatment, while 40 of 44 patients with Genotypes 2 or 3 had undetectable levels of virus at four weeks following treatment for a 91 percent response rate. Any patient who still has undetectable levels of the virus 12 weeks after completing treatment, known as a sustained viral response, or SVR12, is considered cured. Full results from the trial are expected later this year. Patients in the various arms of the Bristol-Gilead study were treated for 24 weeks. The interim data looked at the response rates four weeks after they completed the therapy, considered to be a fairly accurate predictor of the likely final results. In one arm of the study, researchers found that adding ribavirin made no difference other than to add side effects, such as anemia, that were not seen in the non-ribavirin arms of the study, Bristol-Myers said. The experimental drugs were considered to be well tolerated with the most frequent side effects being fatigue, headache and nausea. Two patient discontinuations were not believed to be related to the study drugs, Bristol said. A separate study presented in Barcelona tested daclatasvir in combination with Bristol’s experimental protease inhibitor asunaprevir in Japanese patients who had failed prior treatment or were unable to take interferon and ribavirin. That study led to an overall cure rate, or SVR24, of 77 percent. Among difficult to treat patients who failed to be helped by prior therapy, or so-called null responders, the cure rate with the all oral Bristol combination was 91 percent, or 19 of 21 patients. Of those who were intolerant or deemed medically ineligible to take interferon and ribavirin, the cure rate was 64 percent, or 14 of 22 patients, researchers found.

26,GILD,Gilead profit narrowly misses Street view,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc’s (GILD.O) reported quarterly earnings that fell slightly short of Wall Street estimates as sales of its flagship HIV drugs rose nearly 20 percent but expenses also moved higher. Gilead is the world’s largest maker of branded drugs to treat the human immunodeficiency virus, but its near-term future is tightly linked to progress with the experimental hepatitis C drug acquired with its recent $11 billion buyout of Pharmasset. “With sales strength reaffirming their HIV franchise and continued progress towards becoming an HCV (hepatitis C virus) leader, we believe Gilead shares are poised for appreciation,” Wells Fargo analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note. Excluding $194 million in costs related to the Pharmasset deal, Gilead earned 91 cents a share in the first quarter, 2 cents short of the average Wall Street forecast, according to ISI Group. “I think it was a fine, solid quarter,” said Cowen & Co analyst Phil Nadeau. “The top line beat our estimates and the bottom line was a little light, but that seems to be due to a writedown of Greek debt. Speaking on a conference call with investors and analysts, Gilead Chief Scientific Officer Norbert Bischofberger said the company could file for regulatory approval of the hepatitis C drug, called 7977, in certain patient populations as early as mid-2013. He declined to comment on whether Gilead would consider further studies of 7977 in combination with another experimental oral drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N). The two-drug regimen was shown to be effective in a mid-stage trial earlier this month. Gilead’s first-quarter sales of HIV drug Atripla rose 19 percent to $887.6 million, exceeding the $851 million expected by analysts, according to numbers published by BMO Capital Markets. Gilead attributed the large uptick to increased buying from certain drug assistance programs funded by U.S. states. Sales of older HIV drug Truvada rose 13 percent to $758.3 million, also ahead of analysts’ estimate of $744 million. Overall revenue rose 18 percent to $2.28 billion. Analysts expected $2.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Looking ahead, Gilead said it still expects full-year 2012 sales of $8.6 billion to $8.8 billion. First-quarter research and development spending rose 80 percent to $458 million. Including $194 million in acquisition-related expenses, Gilead’s quarterly net profit fell to $442 million from $651.1 million a year earlier. Shares of Gilead, which closed at $52.72 on the Nasdaq, were higher at $52.99 after hours.

27,GILD,FDA staff: Gilead's Truvada may help reduce HIV risk,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc’s Truvada tablets appear safe and effective for reducing the risk of HIV infection, U.S. regulators said on Tuesday. But they recommended a cautious approach for using the drug in efforts to prevent the virus that causes AIDS. Food and Drug Administration staff said Truvada, which is already being used by patients with the human immunodeficiency virus, is well tolerated overall by uninfected people and may prevent infection in high-risk individuals when used in combination with other strategies. FDA staff also acknowledged a strong correlation between the drug’s efficacy at reducing HIV infection and the willingness of those taking it to adhere to the treatment. Their 47-page review document said preventive use of the drug — a combination of Gilead’s HIV drugs Emtriva, also known as emtricitabine, and Viread, or tenofovir — should be weighed carefully against an individual’s risk for infection, readiness to adhere to the treatment and potential for kidney problems. “The individual at risk may be spared infection with a serious and life-threatening illness that requires lifelong treatment,” the report said. Truvada represents a potential milestone in the evolution of the worldwide AIDS epidemic by offering a tablet capable of preventing infection. An estimated 1.2 million Americans have HIV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An outside panel of experts is scheduled to examine the FDA review documents on Thursday and make recommendations that U.S. health regulators will consider in deciding whether the drug should be used as a preventive treatment. Some experts warn that the drug is only partly effective against HIV and that using it to prevent infection could cause protection from the virus to falter if patients fail to adhere to treatment. Shares in Gilead Sciences were off 1.5 percent at $49.17 after the FDA released the review document. UBS analyst Matthew Rodin told investors that the review should have only limited impact on the company because Truvada, which has FDA approval to treat people infected with HIV, is already being used off-label as a prophylactic. He said a Friday advisory committee meeting on Gilead Sciences’ Quad HIV pill for controlling the HIV virus could have bigger implications for the company. Quad is seen as key to Gilead’s continued dominance of the market for HIV drugs. Meanwhile, FDA staff acknowledged that resistance is likely to occur among people who become infected while taking the drug. “The frequency of resistance might be minimized by limiting the duration of drug exposure after infection occurs,” the review document said. The Boston-based Fenway Health Institute, which advocates for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities, issued a statement calling on the FDA to approve the drug as a means of reducing the risk of HIV infection. “If the FDA approves the additional indication of the use of tenofovir-emtricitabine ... health programs and individuals will have improved choices,” the group said. In a 2010 landmark study in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers found that giving a daily dose of Truvada to men who have sex with men can reduce HIV infection rates 44 percent. But other research shows that Truvada’s high price makes it too costly to provide it to all homosexual and bisexual men, who account for more than half of the estimated 56,000 new infections annually in the United States. A team of researchers at Stanford University had estimated that giving a daily preventive dose of the drug to all U.S. men who have sex with men would cost $495 billion over 20 years in terms of the cost of drugs and healthcare visits. The strategy would be far more effective if it targeted men who are at high risk of developing HIV because they have five or more sexual partners a year, they said. If just 20 percent of these high-risk individuals took the drug, the research team found, it could prevent 41,000 new infections over a period of 20 years at a cost of about $16.6 billion.

28,GILD,FDA report on Gilead's Quad focuses on kidney safety,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc’s Quad pill appears to be effective at controlling HIV infection but could lead to kidney problems, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff report said on Wednesday. The regulators said the four-drugs-in-one treatment has a generally acceptable safety profile. But they found evidence of disproportionate numbers of adverse renal events among test subjects that may need to be monitored. They also cautioned that safety measures for women could be limited because only a small number of women were tested. The staff document will be scrutinized on Friday by an FDA panel of outside experts whose recommendations will be considered when the agency decides whether to approve Quad. A final decision is expected by August 27. Quad is seen as key to Gilead’s continued dominance of the market for HIV drugs. Most of the company’s current drug sales, which totaled $8.1 billion last year, come from Atripla, a once-daily pill that combines Truvada with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Sustiva. Truvada consists of Gilead’s older HIV drugs Emtriva and Viread. Gilead shares were up 1.8 percent to $50.34 in morning trading after the FDA released the staff review. J.P. Morgan analysts called the review “fairly benign,” saying potential kidney issues were already well known. “Given what we view as minor issues, we believe the panel will likely support approval,” the analysts said in a note to clients. Foster City, California-based Gilead is asking the FDA to approve Quad for use in HIV-infected patients who have not received any other treatment. Quad combines the experimental integrase inhibitor elvitegravir and boosting agent cobicistat with Truvada. Company research showed that after 48 weeks of treatment, 88 percent of patients receiving Quad achieved target levels of the HIV virus, compared with 84 percent of patients who took Atripla. No more than 12 percent of test subjects were women, prompting staff to note that knowledge about the drug’s safety for female HIV patients may be limited. FDA staff said the Quad patients were more likely to experience adverse kidney events, including alcohol poisoning and renal failure. They noted that one of Quad’s components, tenofovir, was previously shown to be associated with new or worsening kidney problems in some patients. Gilead has proposed steps to address kidney-related issues. The company recommended that kidney function be tested before treatment and that the Quad be withheld from patients suffering renal impairment or discontinued for those who develop problems after beginning treatment. FDA staff asked Friday’s advisory committee to comment on Quad’s safety profile, given the potential for kidney problems, including the need for further monitoring and post-marketing studies to further define risks and optimal use.

29,GILD,FDA panel recommends Gilead's Quad for HIV,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel of outside experts on Friday recommended the use of Gilead Sciences Inc’s Quad pill for untreated HIV patients. The FDA advisory committee voted 13-1 to endorse the four-drugs-in-one treatment, but members said there should be effective monitoring for potential kidney problems among patients and urged further research to determine the drug’s safety profile for women, who have been under-represented in clinical research. The panel’s recommendation will now be taken into account by agency regulators, who are expected to decide on final approval for Quad by August 27. An overwhelming number of the experts said they were satisfied with Gilead’s demonstration of safety and efficacy. But Dr. Michelle Estrella of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the panel’s lone ‘no’ vote, said data on potential renal problems and women’s health was too limited to justify her approval. “There are plenty of alternatives to Quad,” she said. “There’s no huge hurry in approving this drug before the outstanding studies are completed.” Gilead shares closed 1.2 percent higher at $51.84 after the committee voted. Wall Street analysts said the panel’s action was expected and predicted more good news for Gilead on the FDA front. “Approval of the Quad is likely with renal monitoring. Renal monitoring is not a particular concern,” J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note to investment clients. “We believe the Quad will further strengthen Gilead’s market leading HIV business.” In fact, the new drug is seen as key to Gilead’s continued dominance of the market for HIV drugs. Most of the company’s current drug sales, which totaled $8.1 billion last year, come from Atripla, a once-daily pill that combines Truvada with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Sustiva. Truvada consists of Gilead’s older HIV drugs Emtriva and Viread. On Thursday, the panel also recommended Gilead’s Truvada pill as the first-ever drug for use in preventing HIV infections. Nearly 1.2 Americans are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS and the HIV epidemic grows by 50,000 new cases each year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Company research shows Quad to be 88 percent effective at suppressing HIV infection, surpassing 84 percent efficacy for Atripla. But data also indicated a disproportionate number of kidney problems among the hundreds of patients who participated in clinical trials. It combines the experimental integrase inhibitor elvitegravir with the boosting agent cobicistat and two older nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors - emtricitabine and tenofovir. If approved by the FDA, Gilead executives said Quad would provide HIV suffers with the first ever once-daily integrase inhibitor, a class of drug designed to block the spread of HIV by preventing the virus from binding with the DNA of host cells. Advocates said the one-a-day regimen would encourage patients to adhere to the treatment with Quad, boosting the likelihood of high efficacy outside the clinical atmosphere. But HIV activists who provided public testimony warned policymakers to be wary of new HIV drugs that provide only marginal improvements over current treatments but allow drug makers to charge significantly higher prices at a time when public assistance can be restricted by government budget constraints. “Reduced access here in America is compelling AIDS activists to rethink the rules on drug pricing,” said James Driscoll of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit group that provides care for nearly 170,000 HIV and AIDS patients. Gilead said it has yet to establish a price for Quad. Atripla currently costs about $20,000 a year.

30,GILD,FDA panel backs Gilead's Truvada to prevent HIV,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel of outside experts recommended Gilead Sciences Inc’s Truvada as a treatment for preventing HIV infection among people at risk for contracting AIDS, including homosexual and bisexual men. In a move that could lead to a new milestone for treatment in the evolution of the worldwide AIDS epidemic, the FDA advisory committee voted 19-3 to endorse the drug’s use for controlling HIV infection among the highest risk group - men who have sex with men. The panel also approved Truvada’s use for the domestic partners of HIV-infected people and others at risk for sexual transmission, but several members said there should be more data on the drug’s efficacy to justify its use in the wider population. Dr. Lauren Wood of the National Cancer Institute said she voted against all preventive applications because clinical studies did not measure the dangers of drug-related renal problems among black people, who are among the hardest impacted by HIV infection and the most susceptible to kidney problems linked to AIDS drugs. “I don’t think that is adequate when you’re talking about the population that is most at risk,” she said. The recommendation will be forwarded to FDA regulators, who must decide whether to give Truvada final approval as the first drug for use as a preventive treatment for HIV in the United States. Shares in Gilead Sciences closed 1.2 percent higher at $51.25 before the panel voted. The drug combines Gilead’s HIV drugs Emtriva, also known as emtricitabine, with Viread, or tenofovir. It already has FDA approval to treat people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. Nearly 1.2 million Americans are infected with HIV. But clinical research, which shows Truvada to be effective at preventing the spread of HIV among people who take the pill daily, has raised hopes that the United States could stem the growth of a national HIV epidemic that has stubbornly generated 50,000 new infection cases a year for the past two decades. Studies showed Truvada to be more than 90 percent effective at preventing HIV infection among test subjects who took the drug as prescribed, but only 44 percent effective among test populations that included intermittent use. “If taken, it works,” Dr. John Mellors, chief of the infections diseases division at the University of Pittsburgh, who spoke as part of Gilead’s presentation. “Existing interventions have not reduced the number of new infections annually and new measures are needed,” he said. But panel members expressed concern about prospective FDA guidelines that call for education and training for prescribing physicians but avoid basic restrictions on the availability of the treatment. Some said drug recipients should be required to undergo regular HIV screening to them from becoming HIV positive while taking the treatment and unknowingly passing drug-resistant HIV strains to their sexual partners. “The potential for harm here is stupendous. If we were not to pay attention to that, we would have the potential as an advisory committee to do more harm than good,” said panel chairwoman, Dr. Judith Feinberg of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. The committee voted after hearing from nearly three-dozen public witnesses from HIV community activists, who warned that the drug’s promise could backfire by discouraging the use of condoms and offering false hope to healthy people unlikely put up with side-effects in order to maintain the daily dosage. Some witnesses expressed concern that Truvada’s $14,000 a year price tag could encourage the healthy to treat it as “a party drug” for weekend use, raising the danger of increasing HIV drug resistance and making the treatment harder to obtain for people who are infected with HIV. “They’ll take the drug when they think they need it,” said Dr. Catherine Chien, who like many of the meeting’s 38 public witnesses works with the nonprofit AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a global organization that says it helps nearly 170,000 HIV and AIDS sufferers. “This will lead to higher rates of HIV infection and higher rates of HIV drug resistance,” she said. Half a dozen public witnesses endorsed Truvada for preventive use, some saying it would protect people in high-risk groups whose sexual partners are unwilling to use condoms. “Today is an exciting day for HIV prevention,” Dr. Kenneth Mayer of the nonprofit Fenway Institute said after the committee voted. “Although (Truvada) is not a panacea, this approach can prevent many new infections and could dramatically impact HIV transmission worldwide,” he said. Some panel members, concerned about the danger of drug resistance, urged the FDA to restrict the availability of Truvada as a preventive measures by requiring prescribing physicians to certify through results that their patients are not infected by HIV when they start taking the drug. Other panel members replied that the practice would be recommended but that requiring such a restriction could pose a burden and prevent HIV patients who need Truvada to manage their infections from getting the drug. FDA officials also said restrictions could be easily circumvented because the drug is also sold to HIV infected patients.

31,GILD,Bristol urges combo hepatitis C study with Gilead,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co renewed calls for biotechnology company Gilead Sciences Inc to test one of its hepatitis C drugs in late-stage trials alongside Bristol’s own promising medicine, following impressive results from a mid-stage trial that combined the experimental products. Bristol’s daclatasvir is from a new class of drugs known as NS5A inhibitors. Gilead’s GS-7977 is a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor. Both are designed to block enzymes essential to replication of the hepatitis C virus. Bristol-Myers Chief Executive Lamberto Andreotti, speaking on Thursday at the Sanford Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference in New York, said patients and both drugmakers stand to benefit if combined Phase III trials of the two medicines are pursued. “We have a different point of view about whether to enter Phase III (trials) with that combination,” Andreotti said. “We believe, for both patients and companies, it is better to move forward” in the short term. But Andreotti said Gilead instead seemed intent on looking “in-house” — focusing on combinations of its own products. Gilead officials could not immediately be reached to comment. Andreotti said there was a “huge, unmet need” for better treatments among an estimated 170 million to 180 million people worldwide believed to be infected with the virus. Transmitted by blood transfusions, sexual contact or shared drug needles, the virus invades the liver and can steadily destroy the organ over decades. It is the most common reason for liver transplants in the United States. Data from the mid-stage trial combining Gilead’s GS-7977 and Bristol’s daclatasvir showed a 100 percent response rate in previously untreated patients with the most common form of hepatitis C. Shares of Gilead jumped 11 percent on April 19 when the data were released, showing the profound benefits of combining its 7977 — acquired through Gilead’s $11 billion purchase of Pharmasset — with daclatasvir. At the time, Bristol said Gilead had balked at further collaboration on the combination under study, which was begun while 7977 was owned by Pharmasset. The results of the mid-stage study were accomplished without interferon, an injected drug that causes flu-like symptoms and other side effects that often lead patients to discontinue or delay treatment. Nor did the study use ribavirin, an older antiviral drug that is also currently part of all treatment regimens. Instead of working with Bristol-Myers, Gilead is forging ahead with a study of 7977 in combination with its own experimental NS5A inhibitor. In the meantime, Bristol-Myers is testing daclatasvir with a drug similar to 7977 that it acquired with its $2.5 billion purchase of Inhibitex, as well as with other experimental drugs in its development pipeline. In other remarks at the Sanford Bernstein meeting on Thursday, Andreotti said he expects some form of U.S. healthcare reform to emerge, even if the U.S. Supreme Court rules against extensive reforms approved by Congress and signed into law by President Obama. The High Court is expected next month to render a decision on the sprawling legislation, which would greatly expand healthcare coverage to uninsured Americans but require bigger fees and rebates from drugmakers and medical device makers. Andreotti said the enacted reforms “started out on the right foot” but became too complicated for Bristol-Myers and the American people. The Bristol-Myers CEO said he expects rapidly declining sales of Plavix, a blood-clot preventer which has long been the company’s biggest product, due to loss of U.S. patent protection earlier this month and ensuing competition from a number of cheaper generics. The pill, sold in partership with French drugmaker Sanofi, had revenue last year of more than $7 billion — making it one of the world’s top-selling medicines. Despite expected plunging sales of Plavix, Andreotti said Bristol-Myers has no plans to “downsize” its research spending, having already closed down many company facilities in previous cost-cutting efforts. Bristol-Myers will adjust future R&D; spending in accordance with company performance, and expects significant sales gains to come from Asia but not from Europe, Andreotti said. He said the company plans over the next few years to concentrate on developing medicines to treat cancer, viral infections and blood clots — calling those therapeutic areas “the three pillars” of company growth.

32,GILD,GSK's HIV drug beats Gilead market leader in study,"LONDON (Reuters) - An experimental once-daily AIDS drug from GlaxoSmithKline and its Japanese partner Shionogi proved better than Gilead’s market-leading Atripla in a late-stage clinical trial, increasing hopes for the product. Dolutegravir, which could reach the market late next year, belongs to a novel class of drugs known as integrase inhibitors that fight HIV/AIDS by blocking the virus causing the disease from entering cells. It should help British group GSK rejuvenate its HIV/AIDS business - an area it used to dominate but where it has fallen behind rivals, notably U.S.-based Gilead. The stakes are high with Atripla, the leading HIV/AIDS treatment in the United States, raking in sales of $3.2 billion last year. Dolutegravir’s impressive result may also make a spin-off of GSK’s HIV/AIDS business ViiV Healthcare more likely, analysts said. ViiV is currently run as a joint venture with Pfizer, with Britain’s biggest drugmaker holding an 85 percent stake. Dolutegravir’s success against Atripla, taken as a single tablet, may impress clinicians as Gilead’s own new Quad pill, which also contains an integrase inhibitor, only matched Atripla. In the latest Phase III study, 88 percent of patients taking a regimen of dolutegravir plus two older drugs for 48 weeks had their virus suppressed against 81 percent for those on Atripla, GSK and Shionogi said on Wednesday. The superior efficacy was driven by the fact that more patients taking Atripla dropped out of treatment, with 10 percent of those on the Gilead drug stopping due to side effects against 2 percent in the dolutegravir arm. The result was the second positive final-stage clinical read-out for dolutegravir, following encouraging results against U.S. company Merck & Co’s rival Isentress in April. Two further Phase III trials are expected to report results by the end of the year and dolutegravir could potentially be filed for approval with regulators before the end of 2012, a company spokesman said. That means the medicine may reach the market before the end of 2013, ramping up competition in the HIV/AIDS market. GSK shares were up 0.7 percent by 1150 GMT, while Gilead was down 2 percent in pre-market Nasdaq trading. Dolutegravir is viewed by analysts as a potential multibillion-dollar-a-year seller, as its once-daily dosing is likely to be attractive to patients. However, the financial gain to GSK will be diluted by its deals with Shionogi and Pfizer. Income from the medicine will be shared 50:50 between ViiV and Shionogi, so GSK will receive only just over 40 percent after taking account of Pfizer’s minority stake in ViiV. The creation of ViiV in 2009 marked an unusual drug industry collaboration because of the way in which it pooled GSK and Pfizer’s HIV/AIDS operations into a new business. There have been doubts, however, as to whether the joint venture would have a viable future, given uncertainty about its new drug pipeline. The impressive results with dolutegravir will lay some of those worries to rest. Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at ISI Group, said the latest data was “a bit better than expected”, although it might not be enough to drive big shifts away from Gilead’s drugs. Citi analysts also noted that concerns remained about the cardiovascular safety of Epzicom, one of the older drugs used with dolutegravir. Still, the findings are clearly an overall plus for GSK’s HIV unit and could help make it a viable standalone business. “Today’s news may prompt further market discussion of a possible spin-off of ViiV as dolutegravir is much the most important pipeline product for this venture,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note. GSK Chief Executive Andrew Witty said last year he had no immediate plans to spin off ViiV but was “open-minded” about the unit’s long-term future. Merck’s Isentress, which had sales of $1.4 billion last year, is currently the only integrase inhibitor approved by regulators, although Gilead’s Quad pill containing its integrase inhibitor elvitegravir was recommended by a U.S. expert panel in May.

Volibris is the Canadian and European brand name for Gilead Sciences’ Letairis, which British group GSK sells outside the United States. The drug is approved to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare and potentially fatal disorder of arteries in the lungs which also affects the heart. But it may also be used by some doctors on an “off label” basis for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The warning letter followed a clinical trial which found higher rates of disease progression or deaths in IPF patients on Volibris when compared to placebo. “GlaxoSmithKline has sent a letter to healthcare professionals informing them of this new safety information,” Health Canada said. Gilead’s drug competes with Tracleer, made by Swiss company Actelion.

37,GILD,FDA approves Gilead's four-drug HIV treatment,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Monday approved Gilead Sciences Inc’s four-drug combination pill to treat HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The four drugs in one pill, which was formerly called the Quad and had been considered one of Gilead’s more important future growth drivers, will be sold under the brand name Stribild, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. Gilead shares were virtually unchanged from their $57.19 Nasdaq close as Wall Street has been focused on development of the experimental hepatitis C treatment that Gilead acquired with its $11 billion purchase of Pharmasset. “The approval was on time as expected,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, adding the he expects the new pill will meet or exceed current Wall Street estimates for sales of about $46 million this year and $370 million next year. Yee said he expects Gilead to aggressively market Stribild and deemphasize its Atripla and Complera combination therapies as Atripla contains a Bristol-Myers Squibb Co HIV drug and Complera contains a Johnson & Johnson drug. “The profit margins are significantly better because this drug is wholly owned by Gilead,” Yee said of the quad pill. Stribild, a once-daily treatment, contains two previously approved HIV medicines and two new drugs. The older medicines, emtricitabine and tenofovir, are currently sold by Gilead in its combination pill Truvada, which was approved in 2004, and are also part of Gilead’s Atripla three-drug combination. The newer drugs are elvitegravir and cobicistat. “Through continued research and drug development, treatment for those infected with HIV has evolved from multi-pill regimens to single-pill regimens,” Edward Cox, director of the Office of Antimicrobial Products at the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. “New combination HIV drugs like Stribild help simplify treatment regimens.” As a condition of approval, Gilead will be required to conduct additional studies to help further characterize the drug’s safety in women and children, how resistance develops to Stribild, and the possibility of interactions between Stribild and other drugs, the FDA said. The drug’s label will also carry a boxed warning of the potential for a build up of lactic acid in the blood and severe liver problems, both of which can be fatal. The warning also states that Stribild is not approved to treat chronic hepatitis B virus infection, the FDA said. About 1.2 million people in the United States are infected with HIV, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

38,GILD,Analysis: Use of pill to prevent HIV may be limited in U.S,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The first preventive pill for HIV has been hailed as a landmark in the fight against AIDS in the United States, but experts say only a small percentage of those at risk will benefit from it. U.S. health regulators last month approved Gilead Sciences Inc’s Truvada — already used globally to treat the human immunodeficiency virus — for preventing the infection in healthy people at high risk of contracting the virus that causes AIDS. A number of factors will limit the drug’s use for preventing HIV, including the fact that in the United States many people most at risk of infection, as well as their sexual partners, do not have consistent access to healthcare. Even for those with coverage, insurance reimbursement for a $14,000-a-year drug is expected to be tricky. In addition, therapy with the drug would require otherwise healthy young people to take a pill each day, plus show up for HIV testing every three months. “There are a number of rather significant implementation challenges,” said Dr. Stephen Morin, director of the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies at the University of California at San Francisco. “Part of it has to do with the requirement to take a pill a day, which could be addressed by a more long-term administration of the drug.” Scientists are exploring a variety of tactics for using AIDS drug formulations to prevent HIV infection, including long-acting injections, gels and vaginal rings. About 50,000 new HIV infections are reported each year in the United States. The number of patients taking Truvada to prevent HIV will likely be “a lot less” than that, said Howard Jaffe, head of the Gilead Foundation and a member of the company’s senior management since 1991. Gilead declined to give its own sales estimate. “We are not expecting a meaningful increase or uptick in Truvada use from it,” Jaffe said, referring to the FDA prevention approval. “We do expect it to enter into the conversation with regard to certain high-risk populations.” He said use of Truvada to prevent HIV infection will likely be most important outside of the United States, as developing countries where AIDS remains an epidemic look for additional ways to curb transmission of the virus. Gilead has deals, mainly with generic drugmakers in India, to produce low-cost versions of its drugs for use in sub-Saharan Africa and other developing regions. Dr. Paul Volberding, director of the Center for AIDS Research at the University of California at San Francisco, says Truvada could become a valuable tool for “a small fraction of people” who understand they have a high risk of exposure — mainly female sex workers whose clients won’t use condoms and gay men who decide they are going to engage in riskier sex. “There is an easy consensus now that somebody that is on treatment and fully suppressed has either zero, or close to it, risk of transmitting the virus,” Volberding said. He and others emphasized that wider testing for HIV — and treatment of already infected patients — are the keys to reducing HIV incidence. Of the 1.2 million Americans estimated to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus, almost 20 percent of them do not know it, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . A recent study by the CDC found that 41 percent of U.S. HIV patients are under continual care of a doctor and just 28 percent had the viral infection under control. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July approved Truvada for adults who do not have the virus but may engage in sexual activity with HIV-infected partners, a concept known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The approval was for use in combination with safer sex practices, such as condoms. The drug, which combines two anti-HIV drugs in one pill, was already approved for use with other antiretroviral agents to treat patients 12 and older who are infected with the virus. Antiretrovirals are designed to block various steps in replication of the virus. Critics, including the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a non-profit provider of HIV/AIDS medical care, argue that Truvada was shown to be only partially effective in preventing HIV transmission, can cause side effects including kidney problems and may cause healthy people to become resistant to it. No U.S. public money has been allocated for treating uninsured individuals who do not already have AIDS, and some doctors question the degree to which insured patients would be covered. “I would find it very difficult for there to be a provision to support funding for such a program when we have (HIV-positive) patients on waiting lists,” said Murray Penner, deputy executive director at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, which represents public-health departments. State AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs), which provide HIV treatment to low-income and uninsured patients, had 9,000 people on waiting lists a year ago. That number fell to 700 in mid-August after emergency federal funding was released, although many recession-battered states have tightened income criteria, reducing the number of eligible patients. ADAPs generally have a total of more than 200,000 people enrolled in them over the course of a year, Penner said. Gilead, like other drugmakers, sells its HIV pills to ADAP programs at a significant discount. “When we talk to our physician consultants who target HIV patients, they say they are not going to use much of it (Truvada) for prevention,” said Phil Nadeau, an analyst at Wall Street firm Cowen & Co. Any use of Truvada for preventing HIV infection “seems to be a rounding error in our estimates for treating HIV,” he said, projecting Gilead’s 2012 sales from the drug at $3.1 billion. RBC Capital Markets described the prevention indication as a “niche” opportunity for Gilead, while Morgan Stanley said it “looks like a modest opportunity but many questions remain.” The CDC has recommended since early 2011 that high-risk gay and bisexual men should use the drug to protect against HIV. Large insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc, WellPoint Inc and Aetna Inc say they cover Truvada for prevention as well as treatment of HIV, but are still deciding whether to institute rules about authorization. Doctors remain skeptical that insurers will pay for Truvada without complicated documentation showing why a patient is high-risk and whether PrEP is the best preventive measure. “It’s not quite clear to me whether or not I’m going to be prescribing it,” said Dr. Mehri McKellar, an infectious disease expert at Duke University in North Carolina. She described one HIV-positive patient whose male partner had not been infected. “They had read about PrEP, but they use condoms 100 percent of the time,” she said. “This is not supposed to at all replace condom use. It’s not clear whether we should be talking about PrEP.” ",9072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-health-aids-prevention/analysis-use-of-pill-to-prevent-hiv-may-be-limited-in-u-s-idUSBRE88611M20120907
39,GILD,Gilead third-quarter profit beats Wall Street estimates,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its outlook for full-year sales on strong demand for its antiviral drugs, sending its shares up 3 percent. Adjusting for one-time items, the company earned $1.00 a share in the third quarter, beating the average Wall Street estimate of 94 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Gilead reported a strong quarter, with the top-line beat generated by particularly strong Truvada sales, good Complera growth, and solid Viread sales,” Wells Fargo analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note. He expects the strong quarter to restore momentum to Gilead’s shares going into next month’s Annual Meeting of the Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, which will feature key data on several experimental treatments for hepatitis C. Gilead is the world’s largest maker of branded drugs to treat the human immunodeficiency virus, the cause of AIDS, but its near-term future is tightly linked to progress with an experimental hepatitis C drug acquired with its $11 billion buyout of Pharmasset. The company said it could file as early as mid-2013 for regulatory approval of its hepatitis C treatment regimen. The liver-destroying virus is estimated to infect up to 170 million people worldwide. Several drugmakers, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N), Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX.O), are racing to develop more effective, easier-to-use hepatitis C treatments expected to bring in billions of dollars in revenue once approved. “Gilead delivered another good quarter ... we can have confidence in an array of growth drivers,” John Milligan, Gilead’s president and chief operating officer, said on a conference call with analysts and investors.

43,GILD,Gilead posts positive results in mid-stage Hepatitis C study,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc on Saturday reported a 100 percent cure rate using a combination of drugs in a small number of patients with the most common and hardest to treat form of hepatitis C. Rival Abbott Laboratories Inc, meanwhile, said a trio of its oral medicines to treat hepatitis C produced unprecedented cure rates in a larger number of patients who had failed to benefit from standard treatment, as well as very high cure rates for newly treated patients. Data from both companies’ mid-stage trials were released Saturday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease in Boston. Gilead’s study, dubbed Electron, examined 25 patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who were treated for 12 weeks with a combination of three drugs: sofosbuvir, ribavirin and GS-5885. GS-5885 is from a promising new class of drugs known as NS5A inhibitors, which prevent the hepatitis C virus from replicating. The infection was undetectable four weeks after completing therapy in all of the patients who had never received this combination of drugs before, Gilead said. The drugs generally were well tolerated in the study, Gilead said. In the sofosbuvir combined with GS-5885 and ribavirin patient groups, one patient dropped out because of an adverse side effect that the company said was unrelated to the drugs. Sofosbuvir and GS-5885 are still being studied for their safety and efficacy. The biopharmaceutical company will present the data on Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases in Boston. Mark Schoenebaum, a biotech analyst with ISI Group, said in a research note that he expects Gilead shares to rise on Monday based on these “best case” results. UBS analyst Matthew Roden said “these data strongly support Gilead’s leadership position” in the hepatitis C virus space. Gilead recently started the first Phase 3 trial evaluating a fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and GS-5885 in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus infection who had not received these drugs before. This study is evaluating the fixed-dose combination with and without ribavirin for 12- and 24-weeks in 800 patients, 20 percent of whom have evidence of cirrhosis, or liver scarring.

YM took hold of CYT387 with its acquisition of the Australian biopharmaceutical company Cytopia Ltd in 2010. “It’s a good outcome for YM because they bought the product for a relatively modest amount, and a good fit for Gilead’s strategy of broadening its portfolio particularly in oncology,” Edison Investment Research analyst Christian Glennie said. Gilead said it will pay $2.95 per YM share and that it plans to fund the acquisition with cash on hand. The deal would be valued at about $465 million based on YM’s outstanding shares, excluding options. As of September 30, YM had cash and short-term deposits of C$125.5 million ($127 million), according to a filing. “While the valuation is less than the $4-$5 fair value we had assumed for YM, ... there is a relatively low probability another party enters with a higher bid,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013. BofA Merrill Lynch and Bloom Burton & Co were financial advisers of YM, while Gilead was advised by Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and Blake Cassels and Graydon LLP.

53,GILD,Gilead's two hepatitis C drug trials meet study goals,"(Reuters) - Biotechnology company Gilead Sciences on Monday said two trials of its hepatitis C drug, the centerpiece of its oral hepatitis C treatment program, met their goals in two late-stage studies. The results are expected to be used to support the company’s regulatory filing seeking approval in the United States. Industry analysts say the market for such drugs could reach $25 billion by 2020. An estimated 4 million Americans have the virus, with 170 million infected worldwide. Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs program is considered among the most advanced of many companies racing to bring an interferon-free treatment regimen to market. The newer hepatitis C drugs, while doubling the cure rate of prior treatments, must still be taken with interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that lead many patients to discontinue or put off treatment. Gilead, widely seen as a front runner in a crowded field, paid about $11 billion last year to acquire Pharmasset, the company that developed the drug. Both studies, dubbed Fission and Neutrino, tested the drug for 12 weeks in patients who have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and have never been treated for it. The Fission study evaluated once-daily nucleotide sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin. The Neutrino study combined nucleotide sofosbuvir with ribavirin and pegylated interferon. In the Fission study, patients with HCV infection were selected at random to receive either a 12-week course of sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (RBV), or standard of care with 24 weeks of pegylated interferon alfa-2a (peg-IFN) plus RBV. The study met its primary goal, showing that the experimental treatment, sofosbuvir plus RBV, was just as good as the standard treatment, peg-IFN plus RBV. In the study, 67 percent of patients achieved a sustained virologic response in the sofosbuvir plus RBV treatment group, versus 67 percent in the peg-IFN plus RBV treatment group. Common adverse events - fatigue, headache, nausea, insomnia and dizziness - occurred more frequently in patients receiving peg-IFN and RBV, compared with those receiving sofosbuvir and RBV. In the Neutrino study, patients were given sofosbuvir, RBV and peg-IFN. This study met its primary goal of achieving superiority, with 90 percent of patients in the study group showing a sustained response versus a 60 percent cure rate for RBV and peg-IFN based on historical expectations. The most common adverse events that occurred in about 20 percent of patients in the Neutrino study were fatigue, headache, nausea, insomnia and anemia. Gilead shares were off 86 cents at $39.70 in midday trading on the Nasdaq, tracking a broadly weaker stock market. Some investors may view the trial results as initially disappointing because they highlight the perils of extrapolating efficacy directly from small, carefully conducted phase II trials to the larger population involved in phase III trials, noted Bernstein analyst Geoff Porges. But he said he was confident the data will support the regulatory filings. “We regard the results positively, as the company’s key HCV medicine is further de-risked, and the drug should be approved by year-end 2013 with a profile that remains better than both incumbent antivirals (Incivek and Victrelis) and also its next two rivals,” Porges wrote in a research note. The rivals he referred to are Bristol-Myers Squibb’s daclatasvir and Johnson & Johnson’s JNJ’s simeprevir, or TMC435.

55,GILD,Gilead hepatitis C drug meets goal of fourth late-stage study,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc said its experimental hepatitis C drug sofosbuvir, in a late-stage clinical study, was clearly superior to historical cure rates at both 12 and 16 weeks of treatment in patients who were not helped by prior therapy. The cure rate for those with genotype 2 and 3 of the serious liver disease was significantly higher for patients who received 16 weeks of treatment: 73 percent versus 50 percent for those treated for 12 weeks, according to study results released on Tuesday. Both rates were far higher than the comparable 25 percent historic cure rate - or sustained virologic response (SVR) - for these types of patients. “Fusion is the fourth Phase III trial of sofosbuvir that has met its primary endpoint with no significant adverse events,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note. “We believe these results represent the final piece of de-risking for the asset, and approval is as close to certainty as it can be,” he added. In the latest trial, genotype 2 patients fared better than those with genotype 3, which is more difficult to treat. Rates of SVR, which is considered tantamount to a cure, were also lower in patients suffering from cirrhosis, typically among the sickest of hepatitis patients. The study tested sofosbuvir in combination with the older oral hepatitis treatment ribavirin in patients who did not respond to prior treatments with ribavirin and injectable interferon. No patients in the study discontinued treatment due to adverse side effects. Fatigue, headache, insomnia and nausea were the most common adverse effects, reported in less than 15 percent of patients, Gilead said. “With positive results from all four Phase 3 trials now in hand, Gilead is on track to meet its goal of filing regulatory applications in the United States and Europe in the second quarter,” Gilead Chief Scientific Officer Norbert Bischofberger said in a statement. Earlier this month, Gilead said the drug combination also achieved the main goals set in two other late-stage trials of patients who had not received prior treatment. Sofosbuvir also showed promise in a late-stage study called Positron in patients who were unable or unwilling to take interferon, a standard hepatitis C drug known for its unpleasant side effects that lead many patients to delay or discontinue treatment. With analysts estimating a multibillion-dollar annual market, new interferon-free treatment options for hepatitis C are among the hottest areas of pharmaceutical research. Several other companies, including Abbvie Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, are developing interferon-free treatment combinations for hepatitis C, with most focusing on by far the most common strain of the virus, genotype 1. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said Gilead needs to find ways to improve cure rates in Genotype 3 patients, possibly by combining sofosbuvir with other experimental drugs in its pipeline. “Competition in the Genotype 2/3 space is sparse, so even with these data, Gilead probably has many years to optimize before they will face a serious threat,” he said. The SVR rates for genotype 3 was 30 percent with 12 weeks of treatment and 62 percent after 16 weeks of therapy. That compared with SVR rates of 86 percent and 94 percent for genotype 2. Gilead said it will present full data from the four Phase III studies at a future scientific conference.

62,GILD,Gilead drug reduces chest pain episodes in diabetics: study,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc’s angina drug Ranexa reduced incidents of chest pain in patients with diabetes, and the effect appeared to be more pronounced in those with poor blood sugar control, according to data from a clinical trial. Ranexa, known chemically as ranolazine, is already approved to treat angina - a type of chest pain associated with heart disease. This was the first trial to test it specifically in diabetics, who tend to have more complications and can be more difficult to treat that other heart patients. In the eight-week, 927-patient study, known as Terisa, those taking Ranexa reported an average of 3.8 weekly episodes of chest pain compared with 4.3 for the placebo group. The data was presented on Sunday at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) scientific meeting in San Francisco. “Ranolazine is an effective anti-anginal drug in patients with diabetes and may also have a glucose lowering effect,” said Dr. Mikhail Kosiborod, the study’s lead researcher. “If the glucose lowering action of ranolazine is confirmed in future studies, patients with diabetes and angina may derive dual benefit from this drug.” After noting in earlier studies that Ranexa appeared to lower blood glucose levels, Gilead has begun a series of large, Phase III studies aimed at eventually seeking approval for the drug as a diabetes treatment. The primary result would have been more pronounced in the Gilead drug’s favor were it not for an apparent geographic anomaly, researchers said. They found little difference in angina frequency between Ranexa and placebo in patients from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Excluding patients from those regions, Ranexa had a statistically significant reduction in angina episodes per week - 3.1 versus 4.1 for placebo. “The reasons for this geographic difference are not clear,” Kosiborod said, adding that it appeared to be driven by several sites in Russia. Researchers also found that the Gilead drug was especially effective in patients with worse glucose control. American Diabetes Association guidelines call for A1c levels - a commonly used measure of blood sugar - of seven or less. “For patients with A1c of greater than seven, there was a strikingly better effect,” said Dr. Miguel Quinones, chairman of the 2013 ACC meeting, who was not involved in the study. Subjects in the trial were already taking angina medicines such as beta blockers, and were given 1,000 milligrams of Ranexa twice a day or a placebo for eight weeks. Subjects in the study had type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease and were experiencing at least one angina episode per week. Nearly all of them had high blood pressure and 74 percent had a history of heart attack. Angina episodes were reported in real time through an electronic device given study subjects. They also reported the need to take nitroglycerin for chest pain, which favored Ranexa - 1.7 versus 2.1 times per week. There were very few adverse side effects and they were about equal in both arms of the study, researchers said. There were nine patient discontinuations with Ranexa and 11 in the placebo group. Serious adverse events during the treatment were reported in 16 Ranexa patients and 20 in the placebo arm of the study. Gilead investors have been squarely focused on the company’s experimental high profile hepatitis C drug, which is expected to eventually reap billions of dollars in sales. But Ranexa has quietly been a solid performer for the company with 2012 sales of $373 million, up 17 percent over 2011. A future approval for diabetes could substantially boost sales. “For patients who have angina and diabetes this would be a good option,” said Ori Ben-Yehuda, Gilead’s vice president of clinical research.

65,GILD,FDA rejects two Gilead HIV drugs as standalone products,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc said on Monday that U.S. health rejected two of its HIV drugs as standalone therapies, citing deficiencies in documentation and validation of certain quality testing procedures. Gilead said it is working with U.S. Food and Drug Administration to address the questions raised in the rejection letter in order to prove the application forward. The company is seeking approval for its drug elvitegravir for people with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, who have already been treated with other products. The drug blocks the enzyme integrase which is needed for the HIV virus to replicate. Gilead is also seeking approval of cobicistat, a drug that does not itself fight the virus but boosts the function of other HIV medicines. Both drugs are already contained in Gilead’s once-daily single-tablet HIV treatment Stribild, which combines four different medications and was approved in the United States last August. Analysts on average expect elvitegravir, if eventually approved, to generate annual sales of about $300 million by 2016 according to Thomson Reuters data. They expect sales of cobicistat of roughly $242 million over the same period. Overall, Gilead’s portfolio of antiviral drugs generated sales in 2012 of $8.14 billion. HIV treatment typically involves the use of multiple drugs designed to attack the virus from different angles. Gilead licensed elvitegravir from Japan Tobacco Inc in 2005 and has the right to market it anywhere except Japan. Elvitegravir works in a similar manner to Merck & Co’s drug Isentress, also known as raltegravir. Isentress is typically given twice a day. Elvitegravir only needs to be taken once a day, but it’s action needs to be boosted by cobicistat or an alternative drug that delays the metabolism of elvitegravir.

66,GILD,"Gilead profit rises, but sales of older HIV drugs dip","(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) said on Thursday that its quarterly profit rose 63 percent as lower sales of its older HIV drugs were offset by strong sales of new products, but the results fell slightly short of Wall Street estimates. Earlier in the day, Gilead reported positive results from a mid-stage trial of a combination of two of its experimental hepatitis C pills. The company’s shares were flat in after-hours trade as investors quickly turned their focus back to that multi-billion-dollar market opportunity. Gilead, the world’s largest maker of branded HIV drugs, posted an adjusted first-quarter profit of 48 cents a share, compared with the 50 cents a share Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The revenues were a little light and EPS was 2 cents short, but they said a lot of it was inventory drawdown,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, who noted that other biotechnology companies including Amgen (AMGN.O) had similar inventory issues. “So the focus now will shift back to hep C.” Wells Fargo analyst Brian Abrahams called Gilead’s HIV results for the quarter “mixed,” with “light revenues for legacy products but strong growth of new launches, and solid progress with the diversifying pipeline.” Gilead’s shares, which have nearly doubled over the past 12 months, were slightly higher at $52.30 after hours after rising 2 percent to close at $52.18 on Nasdaq. Gilead, based in Foster City, California, is the world’s largest maker of branded drugs to treat the human immunodeficiency virus, the cause of AIDS, but its near-term value is tightly linked to progress in developing new drugs to treat the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus. The company said the small mid-stage trial showed that almost all patients taking a fixed-dose combination of two of its experimental hepatitis C pills appeared to have eliminated the hepatitis C virus after either eight weeks or 12 weeks of treatment. Wall Street expects that any approved oral regimen for hepatitis C will garner billions of dollars in annual sales. Gilead said first-quarter net profit rose to $722.2 million, or 43 cents per share, from $442 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales of HIV drug Atripla fell 1 percent to $877.1 million, while sales of another older product, Truvada, fell 8 percent to $700.2 million, which Gilead attributed to de-stocking of inventory that buyers had built up in late 2012 ahead of price increases. Sales of newer HIV drug Complera rose 184 percent to $148.2 million while sales of recently launched Stribild totaled $92.1 million for the quarter. Gilead said the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs nearly doubled its usual purchase level in the fourth quarter of last year and did “minimal” buying in the first quarter.

70,GILD,Gilead combo hepatitis C pill effective in small trial,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc on Thursday said almost all patients taking a fixed-dose combination of two of its experimental hepatitis C drugs appeared to have eliminated the liver virus after either eight weeks or 12 weeks of treatment in a small mid-stage study. The data should strengthen the widely held perception that Gilead is leading the race among many companies to bring to market a highly curative, all-oral regimen with shorter treatment durations for the serious liver disease. Gilead shares rose 5 percent after the data was released. Calling them “excellent results,” Stifel analyst Joel Sendek said in a research note, “We see Gilead further increasing the pressure on its hepatitis C competitors with positive Phase II Lonestar trial data evaluating a short 8-week regimen of sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir.” AbbVie and Bristol-Myers Squibb are also developing highly promising all-oral hepatitis C treatments, seen as not far behind Gilead. But those regimens require patients to take many more pills each day than does Gilead’s. The Gilead combination pill is taken once a day and is being tested with and without the older drug ribavirin, which is typically taken twice a day. Current treatments introduced in 2011 must still be taken with ribavirin and the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms and leads many patients to delay or discontinue treatment. The current standard treatment takes either 24 or 48 weeks. The new combinations are attempting to cut the duration to 12 weeks, or as few as eight. Gilead is expected to have a new hepatitis C treatment approved next year. Based on the favorable interim data from the Lonestar trial of 60 previously untreated patients, Gilead said it plans to conduct a third late-stage study of the once-daily fixed-dose combination tablet pairing sofosbuvir and ledipasvir. The new Phase III trial, called ION-3, will enroll 600 patients new to treatment who have the most common and difficult to treat genotype 1 form of hepatitis C, Gilead said. It will evaluate the combination tablet for eight weeks of treatment, with and without ribavirin, as well as for 12 weeks without ribavirin. An all-oral combination with high cure rates that does not include ribavirin, which also has some tough to tolerate side effects, would be viewed by doctors and patients as a huge advantage over those that include the older drug. Wall Street expects any approved oral regimen for hepatitis C to garner billions of dollars in annual sales. Gilead said all 19 patients in the Lonestar trial who took its combo pill for 12 weeks had a sustained virologic response (SVR), meaning they had no detectable signs of the virus, as assessed by blood tests given four weeks after completing therapy. They will be followed for a further 20 weeks. Any patient in whom the virus is undetectable 24 weeks after completing treatment is deemed to be cured. In another arm of the trial, 40 of 41 patients who took the tablet for eight weeks were deemed free of the virus eight weeks after they completed treatment. The one patient who relapsed was from a group that took the combo tablet but not ribavirin, the company said. That may suggest that 12 weeks of treatment will be necessary if ribavirin is not part of the regimen. Gilead also tested 40 patients who had failed to be helped by current treatments, half of them with cirrhosis - an indication of advanced disease. Ninety-five percent of those more difficult to treat patients had no sign of the virus four weeks after completing 12 weeks of the combination pill either with or without ribavirin, according to preliminary results. Hepatitis C affects an estimated 170 million people worldwide, and if left untreated can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer or the need for a new liver. Current treatments include use of interferon, an injectable drug that causes flu-like symptoms. Gilead shares were up $2.49 at $52.62 in midday trading on Nasdaq.

73,GILD,Experimental Gilead drug effective in early-stage leukemia trial,"(Reuters) - An experimental drug from Gilead Sciences Inc shrank tumors in half of leukemia patients whose cancer had returned, according to an early-stage trial that represents a new foray into oncology by the world’s biggest seller of HIV medications. The pill, idelalisib, is part of a new class of medications designed to selectively block a type of protein known to promote tumor growth in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other types of blood cancer. The “pretty incredible” results illustrate how a growing understanding of tumor biology is helping researchers develop promising new targeted drugs, said Dr Sandra Swain, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which will feature the research at its conference in Chicago later this month. Swain was not involved in the trial. Researchers said idelalisib, also known as GS-1101, produced rapid and long-lasting tumor shrinkage in half of the 54 trial patients treated with the drug alone, stalling disease progression for an average of 17 months. Patients in the trial had previously received a median of five other treatments. CLL, which is typically diagnosed through a routine blood test, is a slow-growing cancer, and many patients do not require treatment until they start having symptoms. The vast majority of patients experience a relapse at some point after initial treatment with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. And about 20 percent of patients have so-called refractory disease, meaning that they either relapse within six months or do not respond to initial treatment at all. “Drugs like idelalisib are probably going to change the landscape of the disease in the next few years,” said lead study author Dr Jennifer Brown, assistant professor of medicine at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Idelalisib works by blocking PI3 kinase delta, a subtype of PI3K proteins known to promote tumor growth. Researchers said many trial patients experienced fewer disease symptoms, while side effects from the drug, including fatigue, diarrhea and rash, were mostly manageable. Seven percent of patients left the trial due to side effects. Gilead, which has dominated the market for HIV drugs and is vying for a lead position in therapies for hepatitis C, is testing idelalisib as a treatment for a number of different blood cancers. The drug is currently in late-stage testing as a treatment for both CLL and indolent, or slow-growing, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Wall Street analysts, on average, have forecast sales of nearly $500 million a year by 2017 for the drug, according to Thomson Pharma. Gilead said earlier this month that it would consider filing for regulatory approval of idelalisib based on pending results from a midstage trial involving patients with indolent NHL who had stopped responding to existing therapies. Data from that trial will be presented at an upcoming lymphoma conference in Lugano, Switzerland, in late June.

The Vertex news came at the same time Gilead said its second-quarter profit rose nearly 9 percent, in line with Wall Street estimates, as sales, including those of its flagship HIV drugs, increased 14 percent. Gilead is the world’s largest maker of branded drugs to treat HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, but investors in recent years have focused on the company’s progress in developing new drugs to treat the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus. Vertex’s statement that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had placed a partial hold on a mid-stage study of its experimental hepatitis C drug because of potential liver problems “removes a short term competitive overhang,” from Gilead’s shares, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said in an emailed statement. Gilead has filed for U.S. approval of its own hepatitis C regimen and the FDA is slated to decide on the application by Dec. 8. Its experimental drug sofosbuvir will be discussed at an FDA advisory committee meeting on Oct. 25. Norbert Bischofberger, Gilead’s chief scientific officer, said results from pivotal trials of sofosubuvir in combination with another of the company’s experimental oral hepatitis C drugs are expected in the first quarter of next year. Wall Street expects that any approved oral regimen for hepatitis C will garner billions of dollars in annual sales. The setback at Vertex “puts a large moat around Gilead’s (hepatitis C) franchise,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a note to investors. Gilead has also begun to develop oncology drugs. Bischofberger said the company intends to file for regulatory approval in the fourth quarter of this year for idelalisib, an experimental treatment for a type of slow growing non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Gilead’s second-quarter net profit rose to $772.6 million, or 46 cents per share, from $711.6 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. The company had fewer shares outstanding a year ago. Excluding items, the drugmaker earned 50 cents a share in the quarter, matching the average analyst estimate, as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales of HIV drug Atripla rose 4 percent to $938.1 million, while sales of an older product, Truvada, rose 3 percent to $807.8 million. Sales of newer HIV drug Complera more than doubled to $188.7 million, and recently launched Stribild had sales of $99.4 million for the quarter.

80,GILD,UPDATE 1-U.S. FDA approves GlaxoSmithKline's HIV drug Tivicay,"WASHINGTON, Aug 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Monday it has approved GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s drug Tivicay to treat the most common strain of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. The once-daily drug, known generically as dolutegravir, belongs to a novel class known as integrase inhibitors that block the virus from entering cells. Tivicay is owned by ViiV Healthcare, an HIV joint venture between GSK, Pfizer Inc and Shionogi & Co Ltd  in which GSK is the largest shareholder, with a 76.5 percent stake. Analysts on average expect sales of the drug to reach about $900 million by 2017, according to six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Tivicay can be used to treat infected adults who have been treated with other drugs or are new to treatment. The FDA also approved the drug for use in children aged 12 years and over, who weigh at least 40 kg (88 lbs) and who have not received treatment with a drug that has the same mechanism of action. About 50,000 people in the United States are infected with HIV each year and about 15,500 died in 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Common side effects of Tivicay in clinical trials included insomnia and headache. Serious side effects included allergic reactions and abnormal liver function in patients who were also infected with hepatitis B or C. Patients received either Tivicay or Merck & Co’s  Isentress in combination with other HIV drugs; or they received Atripla, a fixed-dose combination of three HIV drugs made by Gilead Sciences Inc. A fifth trial evaluated the safety of the drug in children.

81,GILD,Ex-Morgan Stanley broker pleads guilty in insider trading case,"(Reuters) - A former Morgan Stanley financial adviser pleaded guilty to an insider trading charge for tipping a childhood friend to Gilead Sciences Inc’s plan in 2011 to buy Pharmasset Inc, three days before the $11.2 billion takeover was announced, court and regulatory records show. Kevin Dowd, 38, on Monday pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud before U.S. District Judge Anne Thompson in Trenton, New Jersey. The Boca Raton, Florida resident faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine when he is sentenced on January 15, 2014. Dowd’s plea was announced by U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman in New Jersey. Peter Willis, a lawyer for Dowd, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. According to court papers, Dowd learned about the pending merger from a Pharmasset director, who had been the largest customer of the Aventura, Florida branch where Dowd had worked. Prosecutors said Dowd on November 18, 2011 told his friend about the merger, prompting the friend to buy $196,000 of Pharmasset stock and pass on the tip to another investor who bought Pharmasset call options, also betting the stock would rise. Those bets paid off after the merger of the two makers of antiviral drugs was announced on November 21, 2011, valuing Princeton, New Jersey-based Pharmasset at a roughly 89 percent premium over its share price at the time. Prosecutors said Dowd’s friend netted a $163,621 profit after buying $195,808 of Pharmasset stock, while the other investor netted a $544,706 profit on the stock options. According to prosecutors, Dowd admitted to receiving a $35,000 cashier’s check in exchange for the initial tip. Dowd’s friend and the person tipped by that friend are identified only by their initials in court papers. Brokerage records show that Dowd worked for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney in Aventura at the time of the tip, but is no longer registered with a brokerage. Morgan Stanley said after Dowd’s arrest in January that it had cooperated with authorities, and that Dowd had been fired in December 2012. Gilead is based in Foster City, California. The case is U.S. v. Dowd, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 13-cr-00636.

82,GILD,"Gilead drug works against leukemia, trial stopped early","(Reuters) - A pivotal trial of Gilead Sciences Inc’s drug idelalisib has been stopped early after independent monitors determined that the drug was shown to be effective against Leukemia, sending shares of the company up more than 3 percent. The Phase 3 trial compared treatment with idelalisib and another drug, Rituxan, to treatment with Rituxan alone in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who were not eligible for treatment with chemotherapy. Idelalisib is part of a new class of medications designed to selectively block a type of protein known to promote tumor growth in certain types of blood cancer. Gilead said an interim analysis by the Data Monitoring Committee overseeing the trial found that the drug had a significant impact on the length of time patients survived without their disease getting worse. “This was a modest upside surprise to us in both timing and result,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note. He said Wall Street analysts, on average, expect the drug to have sales of $100 million in 2015, $450 million in 2016 and $800 million in 2017. “We believe that consensus numbers will likely go up in the near term,” Schoenebaum said. Gilead said it is discussing the trial results, and a potential regulatory filing, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The company filed last month for FDA approval of the drug as a treatment for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Idelalisib patients in the recently stopped trial will continue receiving the drug, while others will be offered the option of switching to the experimental pill, Gilead said. Gilead, which has dominated the market for HIV drugs and is vying for a lead position in therapies for hepatitis C, is testing idelalisib as a treatment for a number of different blood cancers. Shares of the company, which closed at $58.90 on the Nasdaq, were up 3.2 percent at $60.80 in after-hours trading.

84,GILD,UPDATE 1-New group of oral hepatitis C drugs near U.S. approval,"By Deena Beasley Oct 23 (Reuters) - Patients infected with the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus should soon have better treatment options as new tablets from Gilead Sciences  and others approach U.S. regulatory approval. Gilead’s experimental drug sofosbuvir is the first of a new group of oral therapies to be considered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which has convened an advisory panel for Friday. The treatment is seen as the crown jewel of Gilead’s $11 billion purchase of biotechnology company Pharmasset and aims to replace some of the pills and injections now on the market. “Treatment will become simpler, shorter and safer...a broader group of patients can be treated,” said John McHutchison, head of liver disease therapeutics at Gilead. In a pre-hearing report issued on Wednesday, FDA staff concluded that sofosbuvir is safe and effective as part of a combination regimen for the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The deadline for a regulatory decision on the drug is Dec. 8. Wall Street analysts have forecast sales of $1.85 billion next year, assuming a price of $85,000 per patient, according to ISI Group. HCV affects about 3.2 million Americans, killing more than 15,000 each year, mostly from illnesses such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. The often-undiagnosed virus is transmitted through contaminated blood. While infection rates have dropped since the early 1990s - due in part to the introduction of blood and organ screening - many older adults remain at risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has called for baby boomers to be routinely tested for the virus. Standard treatment has been a combination of interferon, given by injection, and ribavirin, a pill. But both drugs have side effects and neither works directly against the virus. In addition, the regimen is not that effective for many people living with HCV, especially those with hard-to-treat genotype 1 infections. Technological advances over the past decade have enabled the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that specifically target the virus. Two new antiviral drugs, Incivek from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc and Victrelis from Merck & Co , have cured more HCV patients in recent years, but both are protease inhibitors and are still used in combination with interferon and ribavirin. Protease inhibitors are designed to block certain enzymes the virus needs to replicate. Gilead’s drug is part of a new class known as nucleotide analogue inhibitors, or “nukes,” designed to block a different enzyme the virus needs to copy itself. The company says the therapy is more difficult for the body to overcome, and expects treatment times to be shorter and easier to endure. It first sought FDA approval to use sofosbuvir along with ribavirin as an all-oral therapy for genotype 2 and 3 infections, or about 28 percent of the U.S. HCV population. It is also seeking approval to use the drug in combination with both ribavirin and interferon for more common genotype 1 infections, and plans to file next year for an all-oral treatment regimen for those patients. “We have a very, very high barrier to resistance,” McHutchison said. He estimates that around 70 percent of U.S. HCV patients have genotype 1, up to 20 percent are infected with genotype 2, and 8 percent have genotype 3. Gilead is the world’s largest maker of branded drugs to treat HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, but has turned to hepatitis C treatments to diversify its pipeline. “Before we acquired Pharmasset we did a lot of due diligence,” McHutchison said. “I think we picked the right nuke.” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges believes Gilead’s advantage over competitors in the HCV field may be increasing as it becomes more clear that a nuke-based regimen has fewer limitations in terms of dosing convenience and breadth of genotype effectiveness. “We are approaching an inflection point for hepatitis C for Gilead,” he said. It is a competitive field, and there have been setbacks for some. Vertex said in July that the FDA had placed a partial hold on a mid-stage study of its experimental hepatitis C nuke. Bristol-Myers Squibb last year discontinued development of one of its experimental drugs after a patient died of heart failure during a clinical trial and several others were hospitalized. While Gilead is perceived to be in the driver’s seat in the race to produce all-oral treatments, Bristol-Myers is expected to present Phase III data on an interferon-free treatment for genotype 1 patients at next month’s meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases in Washington D.C. That regimen will consist of daclatasvir, which blocks a protein called NS5A that plays a central role in HCV replication. Bristol-Myers sees daclatasvir as the backbone of its hepatitis program, along with its protease inhibitor asunaprevir. Bristol-Myers plans to begin testing a triple oral therapy early next year. Companies like AbbVie and Boehringer Ingelheim are also spending millions to develop new hepatitis C treatments. Gilead’s McHutchison said data on another of his company’s all-oral regimens - sofosbuvir combined with NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir - will be presented at a medical meeting in April, and the company plans to file for FDA approval in the first half of next year. He said sofosbuvir has so far been tested in more than 3,000 patients and there have been no issues with heart problems or other side effects beyond those linked to drugs with which it has been combined. Earlier trials of the company’s all-oral combination for genotype 1 resulted in more than 95 percent of patients being cured, McHutchison said. Some analysts believe the FDA panel could support the use of sofosbuvir in combination with protease inhibitors, such as the J&J; drug, for genotype 1 patients, even though the companies have not asked for such a label. “This could boost (sales) estimates in 2014,” according to a research note from Goldman Sachs. The FDA advisory committee will also hear comment this week on Johnson & Johnson’s application to sell simeprevir, an experimental protease inhibitor designed to target genotype 1 HCV.

85,GILD,"Gilead's hepatitis C drug safe, effective - FDA reviewers","(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc’s sofosbuvir drug is safe and effective when used in combination with other therapies to treat hepatitis C, according to reviewers with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Their review was posted on the FDA website on Wednesday ahead of an October 25 meeting of an outside panel of medical experts who will recommend whether or not the agency should approve the drug. “The currently available data support a favorable benefit-risk assessment for the use of sofosbuvir as part of a combination regimen for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C,” the reviewers said. “No major safety issues associated with sofosbuvir use have been identified to date.” Gilead is seeking approval to market the drug in combination with an existing treatment, ribavirin, for patients with two variants of the liver-damaging disease: genotype 2 and genotype 3, and for patients awaiting a liver transplant. If approved, this would be the first all-oral treatment for genotypes 2 and 3. Current therapies typically include ribavirin, a pill, and the once-weekly injectable drug interferon. Both can cause debilitating side effects. Gilead is also seeking to market sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin and interferon for patients with genotype 1, regardless of prior treatments, and for patients with genotypes 4, 5 and 6 who have not previously been treated. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Abbvie Inc have advanced all-oral clinical trial programs in late-stage development, using a variety of so-called direct acting antivirals, which directly interfere with the virus’s ability to replicate, but Gilead is widely seen to be in the lead. Chronic hepatitis C affects at least 3 million people in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Genotype 1 is the most common form, accounting for about 70 percent of cases. Analysts on average expect Gilead’s drug to generate sales of $1.73 billion in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The FDA advisory panel voted 15 to 0 in favor of approval of the drug in patients with two variants of the liver-damaging disease - genotype 2 and genotype 3 - in combination with an existing treatment, ribavirin. If approved, it will be the first all-oral treatment for genotypes 2 and 3, obviating the need for the injectable drug interferon, which can cause debilitating side effects. Panelists called the vote “historic” and a “game-changer.” “Our patients have been waiting for this for a long time,” said Dr. Curt Hagedorn, chief of medicine service at the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare Service. The panel also voted unanimously to approve the drug in patients with genotype 1 and genotype 4 variants in combination with ribavirin and interferon in patients who have not received prior therapy. Genotype 1 accounts for roughly 70 percent of hepatitis C cases. The FDA is not bound to follow the advice of its panels but typically does so. “We’d already built in 100 percent chance of approval into our valuation for the company,” said Karen Andersen, an analyst at Morningstar. “Gilead is still really in the prime position looking ahead in the hepatitis C market.” Panelists also appeared to support the use of sofosbuvir in patients who failed prior treatment, even though the company has little hard data to support such a claim. “I did think there was a surprise upside result by the end of the panel,” said Michael Yee, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.

95,GILD,"Vertex cuts jobs, forecast as hepatitis C drug sales plunge","(Reuters) - Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc lowered its full-year revenue forecast and said it would cut about 15 percent of its workforce as sales of its hepatitis C drug plunged further. Vertex shares fell as much as 5 percent on Tuesday after the company said sales from the drug, Incivek, fell 66 percent to $85.6 million in the third quarter. Incivek was hugely popular when it was launched in May 2011 and revenue from the drug topped $1 billion in a few months. However, sales peaked by the end of that year and have tumbled since as patients wait for new drugs that do not need to be taken with the injected drug interferon, which causes flu-like symptoms. “Vertex was a pioneer in launching one of the first antivirals against hepatitis C. Now they have essentially lost their leadership,” Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert told Reuters. The steep drop in Incivek sales was responsible for a much bigger-than-expected increase in the company’s quarterly loss. Most of the 370 jobs Vertex is eliminating are from the team that sells Incivek. The company said it would incur a related restructuring charge of about $35 million-$45 million in 2013. Incivek faces competition from all-oral hepatitis C treatments being developed by Abbvie Inc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Gilead Sciences Inc. William Blair analyst Katherine Xu said she expects sales of Incivek to drop to zero when Gilead launches its oral hepatitis C treatment. Gilead’s sofosbuvir was backed by an advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week and a decision on the drug’s approval is expected in December. Vertex is also developing an interferon-free oral hepatitis C treatment but received a setback when the drug was placed on a partial clinical hold by the FDA in July after three patients taking the drug showed signs of liver damage. Apart from the oral hepatitis C treatment, Vertex said it would focus on developing its cystic fibrosis drug, Kalydeco, for wider use. Kolbert, who has a “buy” rating on the stock, said Vertex could expand the use of Kalydeco to a broader population in two years, becoming the leader in the market for cystic fibrosis drugs. “The majority of the drugs on the market for cystic fibrosis treat the symptoms, not the underlying cause of the disease,” he said. “Vertex will have a virtual monopoly on cystic fibrosis drug market for many years to come.” Kalydeco, which treats cystic fibrosis in patients with a particular genetic mutation, has been boosting Vertex’s revenue in the last couple of quarters. Revenue from the drug more than doubled to $101.1 million in the third quarter. Vertex raised its full-year forecast for Kalydeco sales to $360 million-$365 million from the $345 million-$360 million it forecast in July. The company said the job cuts, nearly half of which would be in Massachusetts, would help to reduce operating expenses by $150 million to $200 million in 2014. Vertex said it expects full-year revenue to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.05 billion, down from its previous forecast of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. The company’s net loss increased to $124.1 million, or 54 cents per share, from $57.5 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had estimated a loss of 34 cents per share for the quarter ended September 30. Vertex shares were down about 3 percent at $75.24 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.

96,GILD,"UPDATE 2-Vertex cuts jobs, forecast as hep C drug sales plunge","* Sales of hep C drug fall 66 pct to $85.6 mln * Cuts 370 jobs worldwide * Cuts 2013 revenue forecast to $1-$1.05 bln from $1.1-$1.2 bln * Shares fall 5 pct By Vrinda Manocha Oct 29 (Reuters) - Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc  lowered its full-year revenue forecast and said it would cut about 15 percent of its workforce as sales of its hepatitis C drug plunged further. Vertex shares fell as much as 5 percent on Tuesday after the company said sales from the drug, Incivek, fell 66 percent to $85.6 million in the third quarter. Incivek was hugely popular when it was launched in May 2011 and revenue from the drug topped $1 billion in a few months. However, sales peaked by the end of that year and have tumbled since as patients wait for new drugs that do not need to be taken with the injected drug interferon, which causes flu-like symptoms. “Vertex was a pioneer in launching one of the first antivirals against hepatitis C. Now they have essentially lost their leadership,” Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert told Reuters. The steep drop in Incivek sales was responsible for a much bigger-than-expected increase in the company’s quarterly loss. Most of the 370 jobs Vertex is eliminating are from the team that sells Incivek. The company said it would incur a related restructuring charge of about $35 million-$45 million in 2013.

The Dow industrials ended at another record high above 16,000. Both the Dow and the S&P; 500 recorded their seventh straight week of gains in what has been a very strong year for stocks. The seven-week advance comes just ahead of December, which since 1950 has been the best month for both the Dow and the S&P.; “We’re advising our clients to take this ride until the end of the year,” said Drew Nordlicht, managing director and partner at Hightower San Diego. The Nasdaq Biotech Index jumped 3 percent, driven by a surge in Biogen Idec. Shares of Biogen shot up 13.2 percent on heavy volume to $285.62 after the company won 10 years of exclusivity protection for its multiple sclerosis drug, Tecfidera, from regulators in Europe. “Healthcare is the place to be. It’s a hot area. People want stocks in healthcare, industrials and consumer discretionary. That’s where tactical investors have been focused, and that’s where the money has been flowing,” said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc, in San Antonio, Texas. European regulators also recommended approval of a new drug for hepatitis C from Gilead Sciences, which pushed its shares up 3.7 percent to $74.27. The S&P; 500 healthcare sector index has gained 37.5 percent so far in 2013, making it the S&P; 500’s best-performing sector this year. Such moves give investors who have enjoyed some of the 26.5 percent surge in the S&P; 500 this year an opportunity to reduce their positions ahead of an eventual market correction. The CBOE Volatility Index fell 3.2 percent to close at 12.86. With volatility low and the price of options cheap, “you  lighten your stock position, but replace it with a derivative. This way, if the market were to tank, you would lose a lot less on the derivative than you would lose on the stock,” Matousek said. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 54.78 points, or 0.34 percent, to end at a record 16,064.77. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 8.91 points, or 0.50 percent, to finish at 1,804.76.

The European Medicine Agency (EMA) said on Friday its committee of experts also gave the green light to a tuberculosis drug from Japan’s Otsuka, following a review of an earlier rejection. Recommendations for marketing approval by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months. Analysts expect U.S.-based Gilead’s sales to surge higher next year on the back of its treatment known as Sovaldi, or sofosbuvir, for people infected with the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus (HCV). The all-tablet treatment obviates the need for the injectable drug interferon, which can cause debilitating side effects. Investors see the treatment as the crown jewel of Gilead’s $11 billion purchase of biotechnology company Pharmasset and the market is expecting substantial revenues. Shares in Gilead were up 4.4 percent at 11.32 a.m. EST following news of the European recommendation. Analysts on average expect Gilead’s drug to generate sales of $4.4 billion in 2015, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma. The often-undiagnosed hepatitis C virus is transmitted through contaminated blood. While infection rates have dropped since the early 1990s - due in part to the introduction of blood and organ screening - many older adults remain at risk. Two new antiviral drugs, Incivek from Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Victrelis from Merck & Co, have cured more HCV patients in recent years, but both are protease inhibitors and are still used in combination with injections. Sovaldi was recommended by an expert advisory committee of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last month and a final decision from the FDA is expected by December 8. GSK’s Tivicay, or dolutegravir, is also forecast to be a significant new product for the British drugmaker. It will be sold through the ViiV Healthcare business, in which GSK is the biggest shareholder, alongside Pfizer and Shionogi. The once-daily drug belongs to a novel class known as integrase inhibitors that block the HIV virus from entering cells, and is designed to be used in combination with other HIV drugs.

104,GILD,"UPDATE 3-US FDA approves Gilead's $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pill","Dec 6 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Friday approved Gilead Sciences Inc’s Sovaldi as a potentially easier cure for chronic infection with the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus. The once-a-day pill is the first approved to treat certain types of hepatitis C infection without the need for interferon, an injected drug that can cause severe flu-like symptoms. Hepatitis C, which is often undiagnosed, affects about 3.2 million Americans, killing more than 15,000 each year, mostly from illnesses such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Most patients will be treated with the $1,000-a-day drug for 12 weeks, resulting in a total list price of $84,000, according to Gilead spokeswoman Cara Miller. “Today marks a landmark advance in the treatment of hepatitis C, opening up new opportunities to stop the spread of this virus and the ravages of this disease,” Dr John Ward, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s division of viral hepatitis, said in a statement. Last year, the CDC recommended that all baby boomers, born from 1945 to 1965, be tested for the virus. Introduction of blood and organ screening in the 1990s has dramatically lowered infection rates for younger generations. Gilead said Sovaldi, also known as sofosbuvir, can be used in combination with ribavirin, an older antiviral pill, for patients with genotypes 2 and 3 infections, which account for about 28 percent of U.S. patients infected with the virus. For patients with genotype 1, which accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. infections, the new drug must still be used with both interferon and ribavirin, although it can be considered for use in patients with genotype 1 infections who cannot use interferon. Patients with the much less common genotype 4 infections will also be treated with a three-drug combination. The Gilead drug’s approval was supported by several studies showing that it helped to eradicate the virus in significantly more patients, with fewer side effects, than the current drug regimen. Sovaldi is the first in a new class of medications known as nucleotide analogue inhibitors, or “nukes,” designed to block a specific protein that the hepatitis C virus needs to copy itself. Analysts, on average, have forecast Sovaldi sales of $1.9 billion next year, according to BMO Capital Markets. Gilead has said it plans to file in the first half of next year for FDA approval of an all-oral regimen for genotype 1 patients. Companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb, AbbVie and Boehringer Ingelheim are also spending millions to develop new hepatitis C treatments. Shares of Gilead, which have nearly doubled over the past 12 months, were up half a percentage point at $74.39 in after-hours trading.

For patients with genotype 1, which accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. infections, the new drug must still be used with both interferon and ribavirin, although it can be considered for use in patients with genotype 1 infections who cannot use interferon. Patients with the much less common genotype 4 infections must also still be treated with the 3-drug combination. The drug’s approval was supported by several studies showing that it helped to eradicate the virus in significantly more patients, with fewer side effects, than the current drug regimen. Sovaldi is the first in a new class of medications known as nucleotide analogue inhibitors, or “nukes,” designed to block a specific protein that the hepatitis C virus needs to copy itself. Analysts, on average, have forecast Sovaldi sales of $1.9 billion next year, according to BMO Capital Markets. Shares of Gilead, which have nearly doubled over the past 12 months, were up half a percentage point at $74.39 in after-hours trading.

107,GILD,"FDA approves Gilead's $1,000-a-day hepatitis C pill","(Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Friday approved Gilead Sciences Inc’s Sovaldi as a potentially easier cure for chronic infection with the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus. The once-a-day pill is the first approved to treat certain types of hepatitis C infection without the need for interferon, an injected drug that can cause severe flu-like symptoms. Hepatitis C, which is often undiagnosed, affects about 3.2 million Americans, killing more than 15,000 each year, mostly from illnesses such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Most patients will be treated with the $1,000-a-day drug for 12 weeks, resulting in a total list price of $84,000, according to Gilead spokeswoman Cara Miller. “Today marks a landmark advance in the treatment of hepatitis C, opening up new opportunities to stop the spread of this virus and the ravages of this disease,” Dr John Ward, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s division of viral hepatitis, said in a statement. Last year, the CDC recommended that all baby boomers, born from 1945 to 1965, be tested for the virus.

109,GILD,Stellar hepatitis C data puts Gilead farther ahead of pack,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc released impressive late-stage data Wednesday for its once-daily combination pill to treat hepatitis C, advancing its lead in the race to develop new, all-oral treatments for the liver disease, and pushed up its timeline for seeking U.S. approval. Gilead unveiled initial results from three Phase III studies that demonstrated cure rates well in excess of 90 percent with as little as 8 weeks of treatment for some patients, and its share price rose 5 percent. The findings were achieved without the use of either injectable interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms, or ribavirin, an antiviral pill that carries its own troublesome side effects. The tough-to-tolerate older drugs have led thousands of patients to delay treatment for the potentially fatal disease and await new options. “The results certainly raise the bar and dim the outlook for competitors such as AbbVie, Bristol-Myers and Boehringer Ingelheim,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said of rival all-oral programs in development that require more drugs and more pills than Gilead’s to achieve similarly high cure rates. Porges, saying the new data could spell the end of ribavirin use and greatly expand the number of people seeking treatment, raised his peak sales forecast for Gilead’s combination to an eye-popping $16 billion in 2016, declining to $6.8 billion by 2020 as the backlog of patients awaiting treatment declines. Stifel analyst Joel Sendek forecast 2015 sales of $5.1 billion for the Gilead pill and said AbbVie would likely have offer its hepatitis treatment at a discount to compete. Gilead said it would file in the first quarter of 2014 for U.S. approval of the combination treatment that pairs its just-approved Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) and its experimental ledipasvir. The company previously said it would seek marketing approval in the first half of next year. Gilead shares closed up $3.51, or 5 percent, at $73.59 on Nasdaq. The Phase III trials tested the combination pill in subjects with the most common, but hardest to treat, genotype 1 strain of the liver virus in both previously untreated patients and those who had failed to be helped by prior treatment. They also included patients with cirrhosis, who tend to be farther along in the liver-destroying disease. Sovaldi, which costs about $84,000 for a course of treatment, belongs to a class of drugs known as nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitors, or “nukes,” designed to block an enzyme the hepatitis C virus needs to copy itself. Ledipasvir belongs to a promising new class of drugs that work by blocking the NS5A protein, which the virus also needs to replicate. Current standard regimens include both interferon and ribavirin and must be taken for 24 to 48 weeks, curing about 75 percent of patients. Gilead tested its combo pill at a variety of treatment durations both with and without ribavirin. But the high cure rates without ribavirin, which can cause rash, anemia and other side effects, are likely to grab most of the attention of physicians and investors. In a study of 647 previously untreated patients without cirrhosis called ION-3, 94 percent achieved sustained virologic response (SVR), which is considered cured, after just 8 weeks of treatment, rising to 95.4 percent with a 12-week regimen. In ION 2 - a trial of 440 more difficult to treat patients who were not cured by prior treatment, including 88 cirrhotics - 93.6 percent were cured by the once daily pill after 12 weeks, while the cure rate rose to 99.1 percent with 24 weeks of treatment. In ION-1, which looked at 865 previously untreated patients, including 136 with cirrhosis, the Gilead pill cured 97.7 percent with 12 weeks of therapy. “In general, the data position Gilead to dominate the genotype 1 landscape,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note. He noted that Gilead’s ribavirin-free regimen involved one pill once a day, while AbbVie’s is six pills a day with ribavirin and four pills without, and includes a medicine that may interact with other drugs. Genotype 1 accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. infections. Hepatitis C affects an estimated 170 million people worldwide, and if left untreated can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer, or the need for a new liver. Bernstein’s Porges said given the convenience and cure rates of the new drugs, the hepatitis C conversation is likely to change from disease management to eradication. “This is going to be very tempting for people to say, ‘We can lick this’,” Porges said. But he noted that demand for the drug will eventually decline as patients are cured. “The long-term economics of curing patients is not good for the drug industry, but it’s totally great for society.” ",12182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gilead-hepatitis/stellar-hepatitis-c-data-puts-gilead-farther-ahead-of-pack-idUSBRE9BH1I220131218

Fourth-quarter net income rose 4 percent to $791.4 million from $762.5 million a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, the California-based company earned 55 cents a share, which beat the average analyst estimate of 50 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 20 percent to $3.12 billion, ahead of the average Wall Street forecast of $2.85 billion. Sales of hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which was approved by U.S. regulators in early December, totaled $139.4 million for the quarter. Gilead declined to estimate 2014 sales of the drug but said demand is strong. “We’ve got a well-tolerated, highly effective cure,” said Kevin Young, head of commercial operations at Gilead. “This is transformational medicine.” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said he expects 2014 Sovaldi sales of $6 billion. “It looks like the prescription trend we’ve all been watching was spot on for the revenue trajectory, which means that there’s going to be off-the-charts numbers this year,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges. “And behind all that the HIV business is chugging along nicely.” Hepatitis C affects about 3.2 million Americans, killing more than 15,000 each year, mostly from illnesses such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. The often-undiagnosed virus is transmitted through contaminated blood. While infection rates have dropped since the early 1990s - due in part to the introduction of blood and organ screening - many older adults remain at risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has called for baby boomers to be routinely tested for the virus. Gilead excluded sales of Sovaldi and other hepatitis C drugs from its forecast for 2014 product sales, which it projected would increase between 6 percent and 8 percent from 2013 to total between $11.3 billion and $11.5 billion. Analysts have forecast the company’s full-year 2014 revenue at $14.66 billion. “It’s hard to imagine that they won’t exceed $15 billion or $16 billion with Sovaldi,” Porges said. “Revenue is going to be up 40 to 50 percent.” Gilead’s fourth-quarter sales of HIV drug Atripla rose 2 percent to $933.6 million, while sales of an older product, Truvada, fell 2 percent to $832.7 million. Sales of the company’s newest HIV drug, Stribild, rose 409 percent to $203.8 million.

119,GILD,Gilead Q4 profit beats expectations as some HIV drug sales rise,"Feb 4 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc, which recently began marketing a new drug for hepatitis C expected to be a multibillion-dollar seller, posted a 4 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday as sales of its flagship HIV drugs beat Wall Street estimates. Gilead posted a fourth-quarter net profit of $791.4 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with $762.5 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings per share were unchanged because the number of shares rose. Fourth-quarter revenue rose 20 percent to $3.12 billion, ahead of Wall Street analysts’ average forecast of $2.85 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

120,GILD,Gilead to license hepatitis C drug to lower-cost manufacturers in India,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences plans to license its breakthrough hepatitis C drug Sovaldi to a number of Indian generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, allowing for lower-priced sales of the medication in that developing nation, according to the company. Although prices for the drug have not been set, company spokesman Nick Francis said in an emailed statement on Wednesday that Gilead aims to establish “tiered pricing.” For example, the price discussed for 24 weeks of Sovaldi therapy would run about $2,500 for certain patients at public hospitals, community clinics and non-governmental agencies in India, the Hindu Business Line reported earlier this week. “Providing treatment in resource-limited settings presents complex challenges, and we will work with partners in multiple sectors around the world to ensure our access program reaches as many patients as possible,” Francis said. Gilead said final details of the program in India will be announced in coming months. The company has a similar program in place for lower-cost versions of its HIV/AIDS drugs. In the United States, where Sovaldi was approved by regulators in December, the drug costs $84,000 for 12 weeks of therapy or $1,000 for a daily pill. The Foster City, California-based company has said the price is fair because the treatment offers a potential cure for the liver-destroying virus without injections of interferon, which can cause severe side effects that compromise patient outcomes. Prices in Europe are also lower than in the United States. The cost for treatment in the United Kingdom is about $57,000 while the price in Germany is around $66,000, the company has said. Analysts have estimated that the drug will eventually generate billions of dollars in annual sales. Sanford Bernstein has forecast sales this year alone of $6.7 billion. But some have questioned whether that is achievable. Many patients including those in the United States, where more than half of hepatitis C patients are estimated to rely on public funding, could have difficulty securing reimbursement for such a high-priced drug. Other companies including Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and Merck & Co are also working to develop new hepatitis C treatments with some in advanced stages of clinical studies. Gilead, which reported 2013 earnings on Tuesday, declined to include an estimate for hepatitis C sales in its 2014 sales forecast, saying only that Sovaldi sales so far have been strong and broadly based. Sales of Sovaldi in the last three weeks of 2013 totaled more than $139 million. The World Health Organization estimates that about three percent of the world’s population has been infected with the hepatitis C virus and that more than 170 million chronic carriers are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis, liver cancer or both. Shares of Gilead fell $3.87, or nearly five percent, to close at $78.15 in Nasdaq trading on Wednesday. Over the past two years, the stock has nearly tripled.

In a volatile trading session, the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500 Index hit a session low of 1,737.92, marking its lowest level since Oct. 18, before rebounding to briefly climb into positive territory with a session high of 1,755.79. U.S. data is being closely watched after a weak reading in the factory sector on Monday sent Wall Street into a tailspin and triggered a global equity selloff. Wednesday’s data left investors with little clarity about the economic impact from the harsh weather this winter.

In another substantial move after the close, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc shares surged nearly 40 percent to $112.25 after Coca-Cola Co bought a 10 percent stake in the maker of the Keurig single-cup brewer for $1.25 billion as part of a 10-year partnership agreement. In contrast, shares of SodaStream International Ltd, a manufacturer of home soda-making appliances, dropped 8.9 percent to $32.60 after the bell. The limp data earlier in the week added to concerns about growth in China and the outlook for some emerging market economies.

127,GILD,"UPDATE 2-Gilead posts higher profit, strong hepatitis C drug sales","By Deena Beasley Feb 4 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc, which recently began selling a new hepatitis C drug seen generating billions of dollars in sales, posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday as sales of its flagship HIV drugs beat Wall Street estimates. Fourth-quarter net income rose 4 percent to $791.4 million from $762.5 million a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, the California-based company earned 55 cents a share, which beat the average analyst estimate of 50 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 20 percent to $3.12 billion, ahead of the average Wall Street forecast of $2.85 billion. Sales of hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which was approved by U.S. regulators in early December, totaled $139.4 million for the quarter. Gilead declined to estimate 2014 sales of the drug but said demand is strong and broadly based. “We’ve got a well-tolerated, highly effective cure,” said Kevin Young, head of commercial operations at Gilead. “This is transformational medicine.” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said he expects 2014 Sovaldi sales of $6 billion. In the United States, the drug is priced at $84,000 for a 12-week course of treatment. The U.K. price is about $57,000 - likely the benchmark for European countries overall - while the price in Germany is slightly higher at around $66,000, Young said. “It looks like the prescription trend we’ve all been watching was spot on for the revenue trajectory, which means that there’s going to be off-the-charts numbers this year,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges. “And behind all that the HIV business is chugging along nicely.” The World Health Organization estimates that about 3 percent of the world’s population has been infected with the hepatitis C virus and that more than 170 million chronic carriers are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis, liver cancer or both. The often-undiagnosed virus is transmitted through contaminated blood. While U.S. infection rates have dropped since the early 1990s - due in part to the introduction of blood and organ screening - many older adults remain at risk, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has called for baby boomers to be routinely tested for the virus. Gilead excluded sales of Sovaldi and other hepatitis C drugs from its forecast for 2014 product sales, which it projected would increase between 6 percent and 8 percent from 2013 to total between $11.3 billion and $11.5 billion. Analysts have forecast the company’s full-year 2014 revenue at $14.66 billion. “It’s hard to imagine that they won’t exceed $15 billion or $16 billion with Sovaldi,” Porges said. “Revenue is going to be up 40 to 50 percent.” The robust early Sovaldi sales provided further evidence that thousands of hepatitis C patients had put off treatment while awaiting newer therapies that did not require the use of injected interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms. For the past two years Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc’s  Incivek owned 75 percent of the hepatitis C market with annual sales in excess of $1 billion. By the fourth quarter of last year with the approval of Sovaldi, Incivek sales all but evaporated, plunging some 90 percent to just $19.3 million. Gilead’s fourth-quarter sales of HIV drug Atripla rose 2 percent to $933.6 million, while sales of an older product, Truvada, fell 2 percent to $832.7 million. Sales of the company’s newest HIV drug, Stribild, rose 409 percent to $203.8 million. Shares of Gilead, which rose 4 percent to close at $82.02 in regular Nasdaq trading, were down 27 cents at $81.75 after hours. Over the past 12 months, the stock has nearly doubled.

129,GILD,Gilead COO: Analysts' sky-high hep C drug view 'not unreasonable',"NEW YORK, Feb 11 (Reuters) - When Gilead Sciences Inc  declined to project 2014 revenue for its high-profile new hepatitis C drug last week, its shares fell nearly 7 percent over the next two days. Wall Street analysts say investors were likely spooked by the omission, concerned it could signal that sales of the new drug, Sovaldi, might not approach sky-high forecasts. On Tuesday, Gilead President and Chief Operating Officer John Milligan again declined to predict sales of the medicine that won U.S. marketing approval in December. But he also did not dismiss analysts’ record-shattering forecasts that the treatment could rake in $5 billion to $6 billion in its first year on the market. “It would be unprecedented for a drug to launch at that level, but because of the duration of therapy being short, because of the number of patients who are out there who have the disease, it’s not unreasonable math to come to that conclusion,” Milligan told Reuters on the sidelines at the Bio CEO & Investor conference in New York. “We’re in early launch phase, just two months in, so it’s dangerous to extrapolate from two months. I can see the number that’s out there. I don’t know if it’s too high or too low based on the dynamics,” Milligan said. Along with its fourth-quarter results released last week , Gilead reported $139.4 million in Sovaldi sales after less than one month on the market. The drug promises to increase cure rates with a much shorter duration of treatment and far fewer side effects than previous standard regimens. “We’ve seen great enthusiasm from the doctors, and the question is how long will they continue to bring those patients in, what experience will they have as we get through this year?” Milligan said. He noted that a rival hepatitis C regimen from AbbVie Inc  with an equally impressive cure rate could hit the market this year and affect sales. But AbbVie’s treatment involves more drugs and many more pills a day, likely giving Gilead a competitive edge. Gilead this week applied for approval of a combination of Sovaldi and an experimental antiviral drug, ledipasvir, that would be taken as one pill once a day, which could also impact future sales. In late stage clinical trials, the combination provided cure rates well in excess of 90 percent, in some cases with as little as eight weeks of treatment. It would allow patients to avoid use of older hepatitis drugs that can cause troublesome side effects. Current standard treatment regimens take 24 to 48 weeks and include injected interferon that causes miserable flu-like symptoms, leading many patients to discontinue or delay treatment, and ribavirin, which can cause anemia and other unpleasant side effects. It is widely believed that thousands of patients have put off treating the virus in order to wait for new drugs such as Gilead’s. By being the first of the expected new wave of oral hepatitis C treatments to market, many analysts believe that Gilead will grab the lion’s share of those “warehoused” patients. “Remember, patients who started in December haven’t gotten through their 12 weeks of therapy yet, so (doctors) haven’t seen that full experience of seeing patients cured and they really won’t understand that until we get into the mid part of this year,” Milligan said. “So I encourage people not to get too far ahead of themselves in thinking about that,” he said of the multibillion-dollar first-year Wall Street sales forecasts. “I can understand the enthusiasm because you can get to pretty big numbers in a hurry.”",2112014,http://www.reuters.com/article/gilead-hepatitis/gilead-coo-analysts-sky-high-hep-c-drug-view-not-unreasonable-idUSL2N0LG25220140211

But he also did not dismiss analysts’ record-shattering forecasts that the treatment could rake in $5 billion to $6 billion in its first year on the market. “It would be unprecedented for a drug to launch at that level, but because of the duration of therapy being short, because of the number of patients who are out there who have the disease, it’s not unreasonable math to come to that conclusion,” Milligan told Reuters on the sidelines at the Bio CEO & Investor conference in New York. “We’re in early launch phase, just two months in, so it’s dangerous to extrapolate from two months. I can see the number that’s out there. I don’t know if it’s too high or too low based on the dynamics,” Milligan said. Along with its fourth-quarter results released last week , Gilead reported $139.4 million in Sovaldi sales after less than one month on the market. The drug promises to increase cure rates with a much shorter duration of treatment and far fewer side effects than previous standard regimens. “We’ve seen great enthusiasm from the doctors, and the question is how long will they continue to bring those patients in, what experience will they have as we get through this year?” Milligan said. He noted that a rival hepatitis C regimen from AbbVie Inc  with an equally impressive cure rate could hit the market this year and affect sales. But AbbVie’s treatment involves more drugs and many more pills a day, likely giving Gilead a competitive edge. Gilead this week applied for approval of a combination of Sovaldi and an experimental antiviral drug, ledipasvir, that would be taken as one pill once a day, which could also impact future sales. In late stage clinical trials, the combination provided cure rates well in excess of 90 percent, in some cases with as little as eight weeks of treatment. It would allow patients to avoid use of older hepatitis drugs that can cause troublesome side effects. Current standard treatment regimens take 24 to 48 weeks and include injected interferon that causes miserable flu-like symptoms, leading many patients to discontinue or delay treatment, and ribavirin, which can cause anemia and other unpleasant side effects. It is widely believed that thousands of patients have put off treating the virus in order to wait for new drugs such as Gilead’s. By being the first of the expected new wave of oral hepatitis C treatments to market, many analysts believe that Gilead will grab the lion’s share of those “warehoused” patients. “Remember, patients who started in December haven’t gotten through their 12 weeks of therapy yet, so (doctors) haven’t seen that full experience of seeing patients cured and they really won’t understand that until we get into the mid part of this year,” Milligan said. “So I encourage people not to get too far ahead of themselves in thinking about that,” he said of the multibillion-dollar first-year Wall Street sales forecasts. “I can understand the enthusiasm because you can get to pretty big numbers in a hurry.”",2122014,http://www.reuters.com/article/gilead-hepatitis/rpt-gilead-coo-analysts-sky-high-hep-c-drug-view-not-unreasonable-idUSL2N0LG2CX20140212
131,GILD,U.S. lawmakers want Gilead to explain Sovaldi's hefty price,"(Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers have asked Gilead Sciences Inc to explain the $84,000 price tag of its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which is encountering resistance from health insurers and state Medicaid programs. The news pushed shares of Gilead down as much as 6 percent on Friday and sparked a sell-off among other leading biotech names on concerns they may have a harder time pricing new medicines. Biogen Idec fell 8 percent, Amgen Inc dropped 3 percent and Celgene Corp lost 3.7 percent. Some health insurers, including the government’s Medicaid program for the poor, are holding off on authorizing use of Gilead’s new hepatitis C drug. While the treatment has been shown to cure many patients, the payors are balking at the prospect of covering the therapy for millions of people at a cost in the billions of dollars. Separately on Friday, Gilead confirmed that it had agreed to supply the new drug in Egypt - which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus due to use of contaminated needles in the 1970s - at around $900 for a 12-week course of therapy, or about 1 percent of the U.S. price. The company has proposed a system of worldwide tiered pricing based on a country’s per capita gross national income. Sovaldi’s U.K. price is about $57,000, while the price in Germany is around $66,000, Gilead has said. A letter to Gilead from Democrats in the House Energy & Commerce Committee, including ranking member Henry Waxman, asks for information on the company’s pricing methodology and its impact on public health. Sovaldi is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment duration with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions. Gilead, in an emailed statement, said it has been working with a number of stakeholders, including federal and state officials, and looks forward to meeting with members of Congress to address concerns about Sovaldi. The drug, approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, is expected to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market. “What is really scaring folks is the volume,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said on a conference call, referring to the fact that more than 3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus. He said sales of Sovaldi will total between $7 billion and $12 billion this year alone. The head of commercial business at health insurer WellPoint Inc said the company is working with regulators and drug manufacturers to bring prices for hepatitis C drugs down to a “reasonable” level. “Our concern is that a treatment will not cure patients if they cannot afford it,” the committee letter, addressed to Gilead Chief Executive John Martin, said. It asked that the company provide a briefing no later than April 3. The letter cited a Reuters report noting that doctors are combining Sovaldi with a newly approved drug from Johnson & Johnson called Olysio, raising the treatment cost to $150,000. “The costs are likely too high for many patients, both those with public insurance and private insurance,” the letter said. It added, “The extraordinarily high cost of your drug raises additional concerns because of the role of the federal government in speeding up its approval.” Sovaldi was approved on an expedited basis by the FDA after being designated as a “breakthrough therapy.” Answers being sought by committee Democrats include the methodology used by Gilead to establish Sovaldi’s price and the public health impact of insurers’ and public health programs’ decisions not to cover Sovaldi for all patients with hepatitis Sovaldi is the first in a wave of expected new all-oral treatment regimens for the hepatitis C virus that have shown impressively high cure rates, well in excess of 90 percent, in clinical trials. The likely launch over the next two years of drugs similar to Sovaldi, under development at companies like AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Merck & Co, could trigger cost competition, Schoenebaum said. “We are going to go from a monopoly to seven or eight players,” he said. “In my mind that is what will drive pricing down.” These new drugs are meant to replace older treatment regimens that include the injected drug interferon, which causes miserable flu-like symptoms that have led thousands of patients to delay treatment and wait for the newer medicines. The older drugs cure about 75 percent of those treated and take 24 to 48 weeks of treatment. The new drugs have been shown to cure patients in 12 weeks or less. JP Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham noted that there was no such outcry from Congress following the last wave of new hepatitis C treatments that could cost about $100,000, cured fewer patients and came with far worse side effects. “Given the very high cure rates with Sovaldi, Gilead is in position to ‘guarantee a cure’ to payers, thereby dramatically reducing the downstream economic burden of a liver transplant, risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis,” Meacham said in a research note. Gilead shares fell $3.46, or 4.6 percent, to close at $72.07 after being down as much as $70.85 earlier in the day. Over the past year the stock has gained 70 percent.

133,GILD,Gilead offers Egypt new hepatitis C drug at 99 percent discount,"CAIRO/LONDON (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences, facing mounting criticism over the high price of its new hepatitis C pill Sovaldi, has offered to supply the medicine to Egypt at a 99 percent discount to the U.S. price. While the drug will still cost $900 for a 12-week course of treatment, that is a fraction of the $84,000 charged for a course of treatment in the United States. The high price tag in America prompted questions from U.S. lawmakers on Friday, after U.S. health insurers said they were seeking help from state health officials to foot the bill. Gilead said it was “pleased to have finalized an agreement” for the introduction of Sovaldi in Egypt, which has the highest prevalence rate of hepatitis C in the world. “We believe Sovaldi could have a major impact on public health in Egypt by significantly increasing the number of people who can be cured of hepatitis C,” Gregg Alton, head of corporate and medical affairs at Gilead, said in an emailed statement. Egyptian health minister Adel El-Adawi said Cairo had struck a deal with U.S.-based Gilead for the government to buy Sovaldi for $300 for a one-month box, according to a recent report on the state news agency MENA. That would imply a cost of $900 if Sovaldi is used as part of a 12-week drug regimen, although the cost would be higher if it was used for 24 weeks, which is also an option based on different drug combinations. El-Adawi said Gilead’s offer would apply to Sovaldi supplies used in government clinics, adding that access programmes would start in the second half of 2014, following completion of registration procedures in Egypt. Sovaldi is in the vanguard of a wave of pills which could cure the liver-destroying disease in millions of people worldwide, or even eradicate it entirely. But that will only happen if the new therapies are affordable enough to allow widespread use. Nowhere is the problem more acute than in Egypt, which has the world’s highest prevalence of the virus, following the use of poorly sterilized needles in campaigns dating back to the 1970s to stamp out the parasitic disease schistosomiasis. Like HIV, hepatitis C (HCV) can be spread through blood, often via contaminated needles. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 150 million people worldwide are chronically infected, most of them in developing countries, putting them at risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Other companies such as Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co are also developing oral treatment regimens for HCV that have shown dramatic results in clinical trials, while reducing the need for debilitating interferon injections. Doctors and industry analysts believe the new drugs will transform HCV treatment - and prove hugely profitable. In the developed world, they are tipped to become major blockbusters, with consensus sales forecasts for Sovaldi alone standing at $9.1 billion in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma. But the risk of a gulf in access between patients in the rich and poor parts of the world is causing alarm among health campaigners who warn of a potential re-run of the battle over HIV drugs in Africa more than a decade ago. Medecins du Monde, a non-profit group that provides medical care around the world, highlighted Egypt as a country in dire need of the new hepatitis C drugs in a report this week.

138,GILD,Gilead says has discounted hepatitis C drug for some health plans,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc, under fire for pricing a new hepatitis C drug at $1,000 a pill, has discount agreements with a number of health insurers, a company executive said in an interview. The medication, Sovaldi, has a list price of $84,000 for a 12-week course of therapy and is seen as a breakthrough in the treatment of the serious liver disease. It has been shown to raise cure rates and cut treatment time with fewer side effects than older medicines, but critics maintain that a price of $1,000 each is too high for an easy-to-make pill needed by millions of Americans. On March 20, Democratic lawmakers led by California Representative Henry Waxman asked Gilead to explain the price tag, and a meeting with the company is scheduled for next week. Health insurers and state Medicaid programs for the poor are pushing for further discounts, fearing a multibillion-dollar pricetag from treating most hepatitis C sufferers with Sovaldi and similar new medicines likely to be approved in coming years. Gilead shares have dropped 9 percent in the last week on concerns over the pushback on drug pricing. The news has also weighed on other biotechnology companies that are banking on their ability to command high prices for new treatments. “It’s the volume (of patients) payers are looking at here. It’s not the price,” said Gregg Alton, Gilead’s executive vice president, corporate and medical affairs. “A lot of them are looking for a discount, but I think the real issue here is how many patients they now have in their plans that need hepatitis C treatment.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 3.2 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, a liver-destroying virus transmitted through blood. If each were treated with full-priced Sovaldi, the cost would be $269 billion. Gilead already provides a mandated discount off its list price to U.S. government health plans and insurers at about 23 percent. Alton said the company has deals for “supplemental discounts” for government-funded agencies such the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense, on top of the 23 percent. He would not provide details. He said the VA, which accounts for about 10 to 15 percent of the hepatitis C population in the United States, has been “proactive” in recognizing the need to treat the disease, which can lead to liver failure and necessitate liver transplants. He estimated that patients eligible for Medicaid, the government-funded health plan for the poor, account for another 10 to 15 percent of Americans with hepatitis C. Alton singled out health maintenance organization Kaiser Permanente for taking action to secure Sovaldi, also at a discount, for its patients. “We have an arrangement with Kaiser that works very well for both of us,” the Gilead executive said. “They recognize that if they make the investment today, they get all the benefit.” He said that is because many Kaiser patients stay for many years with the organization known for quality, integrated care, even into retirement when they qualify for a managed Medicare plan. So Kaiser’s upfront investment treating hepatitis C will pay off years later by averting future costs of liver disease. Kaiser officials were not immediately available for comment. But many traditional insurers can’t rely on the same kind of stability among their policyholders, who tend to switch health plans more frequently, meaning they cannot be sure of the same savings over time. “One of the challenges we have with some insurers is that the benefits may not come to them,” the Gilead executive said. “No matter how we price this product, the benefits and the savings are going to come later.” Alton also sees the concerns over a deluge of patients demanding immediate treatment as unlikely to materialize. “Most of the patients are not diagnosed, and many aren’t seeking care currently,” he said. “This is going to take some time.” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted on Friday data showing that new prescriptions of Sovaldi had dropped 5 percent in the past week. He estimated that Gilead’s 2014 U.S. sales of Sovaldi, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration late last year, will total as much as $9 billion even if it sees no new prescription growth.

141,GILD,WHO joins clamour to make new hepatitis C pills affordable,"* London congress showcases dramatic treatment advances * WHO guidelines back Gilead, J&J; pills but flag up cost * UN agency wants “concerted effort” to reduce prices * Hepatitis C pricing a hot issue for biotech investors By Ben Hirschler LONDON, April 9 (Reuters) - The World Health Organisation wants a “concerted effort” to drive down the cost of new hepatitis C drugs that offer a cure for the liver-destroying virus but are unaffordable for most infected people worldwide. The forthright comments from the UN agency on Wednesday   add to pressure on drugmakers such as Gilead Sciences - which is already facing protests in the United States over its $1,000-a-day pill - to do more to improve access. In its first-ever treatment guidelines for the disease, issued at a meeting of international liver experts in London, the WHO strongly recommended new drugs from Gilead and Johnson & Johnson - with a big caveat on their cost. Treating the approximately 150 million people in the world living with chronic hepatitis C infection is the new front-line in the battle over access to medicines. As with AIDS 15 years ago, modern drugs are transforming the ability to fight hepatitis C because pills such as Gilead’s Sovaldi are far more effective and better-tolerated than older injection regimens, with cure rates well above 90 percent in many cases. “These drugs are fantastic - they are a real breakthrough,” Markus Peck-Radosavljevic, a professor of medicine in Vienna and secretary-general of the European Association for the Study of the Liver, told Reuters. “But the prices are too high.” Pharmaceutical companies say they need to charge high prices on new successful drugs to cover the huge cost of development, including of those that fail to make it to the market. A record number of promising results from late-stage clinical trials on a range of new oral medicines will be showcased at the International Liver Congress this week. Hepatitis C virus, or HCV, is spread through blood, often via contaminated needles. It causes cirrhosis and liver cancer. The vast majority of cases are in poorer countries where the complexity, cost and side effects of current treatments have made treatment impractical. The arrival of simple pills, taken for as little as a couple of months, could revolutionise therapy, if the price is right. By giving governments a plan setting out how to test for, treat and prevent HCV, the WHO is laying foundations for tackling the disease, while spurring demand and sending a strong message on price. “I hope these guidelines will help to promote a reduction in price and thereby an increase in access,” said Stefan Wiktor, who leads the WHO hepatitis programme. Drawing a clear parallel with the experience of HIV/AIDS, the WHO believes a “multi-pronged” approach is needed. This could include tiered price discounts by branded drugmakers, voluntary licensing and also compulsory licensing. Voluntary licensing involves a patent owner agreeing to license its drug to generic manufacturers, while a compulsory licence is issued by a government without any such agreement - something the pharmaceuticals industry is keen to avoid. After dragging their feet for years over access to AIDS drugs in Africa, pharmaceuticals makers are trying to take the initiative this time. Market leader Gilead recently agreed a 99 percent price discount for Egypt and plans to grant voluntary licences to several Indian generics firms. J&J; has also promised to work on access and others entering the area - such as AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb  and Merck & Co - are expected to follow suit. But campaigners want more. The Medecins Sans Frontieres group believes a 12-week course of treatment and diagnosis should cost no more than $500. That compares with the $84,000 and $66,000 charged by Gilead and J&J; respectively for their drugs in the United States. There is also a big concern about middle-income countries such as China, India and Russia, which are home to most cases of HCV worldwide but where drug companies are more reluctant to accept rock-bottom prices than in the poorest nations. Charles Gore, president of the patient-led World Hepatitis Alliance, welcomed the WHO guidelines but said international funding along the lines of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was now needed. When it comes to profits, drug companies are expecting to make most of their money in the United States, where medicines traditionally fetch a premium. But the scale of the expected demand for new hepatitis C drugs - which industry analysts believe will translate into annual sales of $9.1 billion for Sovaldi alone by 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data - means the industry is under fire. U.S. lawmakers asked Gilead last month to explain the $84,000 price tag on Sovaldi, hitting shares in the firm and raising fears across the biotech sector. “Until we develop a better model, we are still in the situation where investors in pharma want to recompensed on the winners for all the losers - and there have been a lot of losers in hepatitis C over the years,” said Gore.

142,GILD,"Nasdaq drops 3 percent, worst day since November 2011","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nasdaq suffered its biggest drop in two-and-a-half years on Thursday after another sharp selloff in biotech and momentum names, including Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) and TripAdvisor (TRIP.O), increasing investor anxiety about a broader pullback. The Nasdaq biotechnology index .NBI shed 5.6 percent, its biggest one-day drop since August 2011, adding to recent losses since a large drop in Gilead more than two weeks ago triggered a wider selloff for biotechs and other recent big gainers. That index is now down 18.8 percent since its February 25 record close. The S&P; 500 also posted its biggest percentage loss since February 3, while the Nasdaq has dropped 7 percent from its closing high for the year, set on March 5. All stocks in the Nasdaq 100 index .NDX posted a loss, with the exception of CH Robinson Worldwide (CHRW.O), which ended up 1.6 percent at $53.80. The selling also hit the shares of three companies in their first day of public trading after their initial public offerings were priced on Wednesday night. All three IPOs ended lower. “Momentum names have been driving this market higher. A lot of these names have been trading at stratospheric valuations, and on long-term outlooks, that may or may not materialize. The question is, ‘At what point do they get too expensive?’ Right now, I think they’re looking a little expensive,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. There’s a good chance the selloff in these stocks could continue and the pullback could extend to areas beyond the momentum names, Frederick said. The CBOE Volatility Index or the VIX .VIX, Wall Street’s measure of investor anxiety, jumped 15 percent, its biggest daily percentage gain since February 3, to end at 15.89. Alexion Pharma (ALXN.O) was the S&P; 500’s biggest decliner, off 7.5 percent at $144.19, followed by Gilead Sciences, down 7.3 percent at $65.48, and TripAdvisor, down 7 percent at $81.90. The move was a sharp reversal from the previous day, when shares rallied after minutes from the latest Federal Reserve policymakers’ meeting showed members were more keen to keep rates low than previously expected. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI plummeted 266.96 points or 1.62 percent, to end at 16,170.22. The S&P; 500 .SPX lost 39.09 points or 2.09 percent, to close at 1,833.09. The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 129.794 points or 3.1 percent - its biggest daily percentage loss since November 9, 2011 - to 4,054.106. The S&P; 500 closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since February 10. The stock of bailed-out auto lender Ally Financial Inc (ALLY.N) fell 4.1 percent to close at $23.98 in its market debut. Two biotech companies - Cerulean Pharma Inc CERU.O and Adamas Pharmaceuticals Inc (ADMS.O) - also slid in their trading debuts. Cerulean fell 2.1 percent to close at $6.85, while Adamas lost 12.4 percent to end at $14.01. Among Internet-related tech shares, which were among last year’s biggest advancers, Facebook Inc (FB.O) fell 5.2 percent to end at $59.16, while Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) sank 5.2 percent to close at $334.73. “You’ve basically more than erased the bounce of the last two days, so I would imagine any bounce from these levels is probably going to be met with supply because the market is on very tenuous legs right now,” said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. Among other big decliners, shares of Imperva Inc IMPV.N plunged 43.7 percent to $28 after the data center security company reported preliminary first-quarter results. Rival FireEye Inc (FEYE.O) lost 11.8 percent to $49.75. On the earnings front, Bed, Bath & Beyond (BBBY.O) shares slumped 6.2 percent to $63.72 after the home-goods retailer reported fourth-quarter sales that fell from a year ago and gave a first-quarter outlook that was below expectations. The day’s economic data was encouraging, however, with initial jobless claims dropping sharply last week to the lowest in almost seven years, suggesting job growth may be picking up after a harsh winter. After the bell, shares of Gap (GPS.N) dropped 2.4 percent to $38.33. The slide followed the clothing retailer’s report on its March sales and reaffirmation of its 2014 outlook. In contrast, shares of H&R; Block (HRB.N) rose 7.7 percent to $30.60 in extended-hours trading after the U.S. tax preparer said it would sell some assets and transfer certain liabilities to BofI Federal Bank. Volume was high, with 7.5 billion shares changing hands on U.S. exchanges, well above the 6.8 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by a ratio of 3.6 to 1. On the Nasdaq, about 6.6 stocks fell for every one that rose.

144,GILD,U.S. drug industry group defends price of Gilead hepatitis drug,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leading U.S. pharmaceutical industry trade group on Thursday defended the cost of Gilead Sciences Inc’s new hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, saying such treatments offer a priceless breakthrough for patients with the liver-destroying virus. “Their lives, in short, will be transformed,” Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) President John Castellani said at the group’s annual meeting in Washington. “The value to these patients, and to their loved ones and society - you can’t put a price tag on it.” Gilead’s Sovaldi costs about $84,000 for a 12-week course of treatment, or $1,000 a day. That has drawn fire from health insurers, including state Medicaid programs, as well as U.S. lawmakers who are investigating Sovaldi’s hefty price tag. This week, the World Health Organization joined the chorus of those seeking affordability for such drugs. While Gilead has said it is working to offer lower prices in dozens of developing countries, critics say such treatments should cost hundreds of dollars, rather than tens of thousands. Another treatment from Johnson & Johnson that some doctors have been combining with Sovaldi as other new medicines advance toward approval, costs about $66,000. Sovaldi, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration late last year, is well on track to post record-breaking sales in its first year on the market. Analysts with Capital Alpha have said 2014 sales of the drug could reach up to $15 billion, a figure that would top peak sales of Pfizer Inc’s cholesterol fighter Lipitor, which had been the world’s top-selling medicine before its patent protection lapsed. As many as 150 million people worldwide, including about 3.2 million in the United States, have hepatitis C, which is caused by contact with contaminated blood, often through shared needles by drug abusers or, prior to routine blood screening, from blood and organ transplants. Many people can carry the virus for decades before symptoms appear. But if untreated, it can cause serious liver damage and lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer, the need for a liver transplant or death. “For the first time, 150 million people who are chronically infected with hepatitis C can be treated and cured of this terrible disease,” Castellani said. He said debate over the price of new anti-viral drugs to treat the chronic condition, and the value they bring to patients, has gone “askew,” and warned that researching and developing them comes at a high cost to manufacturers. Defenders of the new medicines point out that older current multi-drug regimens cost at least as much, cure about 75 percent of patients, require 24 or 48 weeks of treatment and have miserable side effects that lead many to delay or discontinue treatment. The newer medicines being developed by several companies have demonstrated in clinical trials cure rates well in excess of 90 percent with minimal side effects and will require 12 weeks or fewer of treatment. Those companies, including AbbVie Inc, Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, are likely to be drawn into the pricing controversy as their new medicines edge closer to approval amid fears that millions of patients will now come forward to seek treatment, causing a massive cost burden to insurers and governments. Merck and Bristol-Myers presented new hepatitis C data on Thursday at a major liver disease meeting in London [ID:nL2N0N12E2] [ID:nL2N0N12BT]. Gilead, AbbVie and others will also present clinical trial data at the meeting. “Policy makers ... need to value innovation and stop implying that it comes cheap,” Castellani said. Foster City, California-based Gilead, which paid $11 billion to acquire the company that had the rights to Sovaldi, has said it is working with government officials and others to help create a globally tiered pricing structure. That plan includes licensing the drug to three or four Indian generic manufacturers to allow sale of the medicine at lower prices in some 60 developing nations. Separately on Thursday, Indian generic drugmaker Natco Pharma Ltd called on the government to deny Sovaldi a patent in India, a source with knowledge of the matter said, potentially clearing the way to launch a much cheaper version of the drug.

If successful, the move could clear the way for the Indian company to launch a cheap generic version of the drug. Gilead, whose medicine has been hailed by doctors as a breakthrough in treating the liver-destroying disease, has come under fire over its product’s $1,000 per pill price tag in the United States. India’s patent laws allow a third party to dispute the validity of a pending patent application. Natco has filed a so-called “pre-grant opposition” with the Controller General of Patents, Designs & Trademarks, said the source, who declined to be named because the information was not public yet. It was not clear when Natco filed the opposition and Reuters could not immediately obtain a copy of the filing. Natco Chief Executive Rajeev Nannapaneni declined to comment. Officials at Gilead and at the patent department in Mumbai were not immediately available for comment. Natco has opposed the patent on the same grounds as New York-based Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK), arguing that Sovaldi is not “inventive” enough, the source told Reuters. I-MAK, a group of lawyers and scientists, filed an opposition in November 2013 to the grant of a patent in India on Sovaldi, chemically called sofosbuvir, saying the drug uses “old science”. Natco’s opposition comes amid a growing clamor by healthcare campaigners and doctors to ensure that Sovaldi and other new hepatitis C pills are made affordable in developing countries. In the United States, some healthcare providers have described the $84,000 price tag for a 12-week course of treatment as “outrageous”. The medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) supported I-MAK’s opposition and believes a 12-week course of treatment and diagnosis should cost no more than $500, saying a high cost would put the drug out of reach to most of the 90 percent of hepatitis C patients living in low-and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization estimates as many as 12 million people in India, a country of more than 1.2 billion people, have hepatitis C. Other experts put the figure even higher.

149,GILD,Texas Medicaid holds off on proposed limits for Gilead hepatitis drug,"(Reuters) - Texas is reconsidering whether to impose strict limits on Gilead Sciences’ $84,000 hepatitis C treatment for patients on the state’s Medicaid health plan for the poor, at the urging of outside advisers, a state official said on Friday. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission, which oversees Medicaid, had proposed a policy to allow the drug, Sovaldi, to be used mainly for sicker patients such as those whose hepatitis C had developed into advanced liver disease, according to state documents reviewed by Reuters. As with most state Medicaid programs, an outside committee of pharmacists and doctors in Texas meets quarterly to review new drugs and recommend policies to the program’s director. The agency had been planning to begin offering coverage in July if the committee recommended the policy at its Thursday meeting. “The board asked state staff to meet with stakeholders, including gastroenterologists, about the criteria, whether it was too strict, and the prior authorization process,” Texas Health and Human Services Commission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman said. In the interim, Medicaid patients in Texas will still not be prescribed the drug. “We’re looking at our options and how that will affect our timeline to get the drug covered,” Goodman said. A Gilead spokeswoman declined to comment. The deliberations in Texas, one of the most populous states and home to a relatively large number of hepatitis C patients, underline the difficulties of state health officials in deciding how to cover the Gilead treatment. It would have been the first major state to craft a policy. Discussions are continuing in California, Colorado and Virginia among others. The Texas move has also tabled a plan that the state had hoped could be in place by July in which it would make supplemental payments to insurers to help offset the high cost of the drug. Texas is among states including California and Florida asked by insurers who manage Medicaid plans to pay for the treatments directly, a move they said was needed because they would otherwise lose money on their contracts. Leerink managed care analyst Ana Gupta said that the Texas per-use payment could be a viable approach to compensating insurers in other states. “It covers the use of the drug while still potentially limiting the utilization only where medically necessary,” Gupta said. She said the price tag to insurers may be $8 billion for eligible patients in Medicaid and similarly structured plans such as those sold on the Obamacare exchanges. Sovaldi has become the focal point for a global outcry over the price of novel medicines, attracting criticism from the World Health Organization, doctors’ groups, state officials and insurance industries. Sovaldi is the first drug to provide a true cure for most patients who take it, but its cost could reach more than $200 billion if widely used in the United States, posing huge risks to state budgets and insurers’ financial results. Gilead Sciences received U.S. regulatory approval for the treatment in December. Many patients are prescribed the drug in combination with another new drug, Johnson & Johnson’s Olysio, pushing the treatment cost to around $150,000. Gilead shares, which have been hit by questions over Sovaldi’s price in recent weeks, rose as much as 4 percent on Friday. The company reported new data on a combination therapy including Sovaldi. One of the country’s largest insurers, WellPoint Inc, told investors last month that it was in talks with state Medicaid agencies about these high costs. “Our view is pretty simply it either needs to be covered in the rates and covered quickly or you have to take it out of managed care and put it into fee for service and pay for it that way,” said Richard Zoretic, president of WellPoint’s government business division. Some patient advocates prefer the second approach because it could encourage better access to the drug. “There is this basic bar in Medicaid where they do have to cover the drug. The question is who is going to get it and what will the rules around that be,” said Anne Donnelly, director of healthcare policy at Project Inform based in San Francisco. For instance, Texas’ policy on use of the drug this year appears to be stricter than the policy adopted in Oregon. Its pharmacy committee has recommended limiting the use of Sovaldi to patients who have moderate to severe fibrosis of the liver whereas Texas was targeting advanced liver disease. State Medicaid programs, funded by both state and federal government, set the policy for drug use in their fee-for-service programs. Coverage can differ because the vast majority of patients are in plans managed by private insurers that heed the state’s recommendations but may also have their own practices.

150,GILD,Texas Medicaid holds off on proposed limits for Gilead hepatitis drug,"April 11 (Reuters) - Texas is reconsidering whether to impose strict limits on Gilead Sciences’ $84,000 hepatitis C treatment for patients on the state’s Medicaid health plan for the poor, at the urging of outside advisers, a state official said on Friday. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission, which oversees Medicaid, had proposed a policy to allow the drug, Sovaldi, to be used mainly for sicker patients, such as those whose hepatitis C had developed into advanced liver disease, according to state documents reviewed by Reuters. As with most state Medicaid programs, an outside committee of pharmacists and doctors in Texas meets quarterly to review new drugs and recommend policies to the state’s Medicaid director. The agency had been planning to begin offering coverage of the drug in July if the committee recommended the policy at its Thursday meeting. “The board asked state staff to meet with stakeholders, including gastroenterologists, about the criteria, whether it was too strict, and the prior authorization process,” Texas Health and Human Services Commission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman said. In the interim, Medicaid patients in Texas will still not be prescribed the drug. “We’re looking at our options and how that will affect our timeline to get the drug covered,” Goodman said. The deliberations in Texas, one of the most populous states and home to a relatively large number of hepatitis C patients, underline the difficulties of state health officials in deciding how to cover the Gilead treatment. It was expected to be the first major state to make a decision; discussions are continuing in California, Colorado and Virginia among others. Sovaldi has become the focal point for a global outcry over the price of novel medicines, attracting criticism from the World Health Organization, doctors’ groups, state officials and insurance industries. The drug is the first to provide a true cure to the disease for most patients who take it, but its cost could reach more than $200 billion if widely used in the United States, posing huge risks to state budgets and insurers’ financial results. The Texas move has also tabled a plan that the state had hoped could also be in place by July to make supplemental payments to insurers to help offset the high cost of the drug. Gilead Sciences received U.S. regulatory approval for the treatment in December. Many patients are prescribed the drug in combination with another new drug, Johnson & Johnson’s Olysio, pushing the cost of a 12-week treatment to around $150,000. Texas is among states including California and Florida which were asked by insurers who manage Medicaid plans to pay for the treatments directly, a move they said was needed because they would otherwise lose money on their contracts. California is still discussing the issue. Florida said it has no plans to carve out the drug but continues to monitor the drug’s use within managed care plans.

152,GILD,UnitedHealth: New hepatitis C drug costs far more than forecast,"(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, said it spent more than $100 million to cover a pricey new hepatitis C drug from Gilead Sciences Inc in its first three months on the market, an amount that was “multiple” times what it had expected. UnitedHealth is the first insurer to quantify its costs to cover patients using Gilead’s new Sovaldi treatment, whose $84,000 price tag has spurred a national outcry over the rising costs of specialty medicines. UnitedHealth shares fell nearly 4 percent on Thursday and shares of rivals WellPoint Inc and Aetna Inc fell 3.8 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively, as investors weighed what their potential costs could be as well. The disclosure indicates that industry-wide, insurers spent $1 to $1.5 billion on treatments in the first quarter, Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch said in a research note. U.S. drug regulators approved Sovaldi in December, the first of a handful of ground-breaking hepatitis C treatments that are expected to be on the market in the next few years. Sovaldi has been shown to cure most patients of the liver-wasting virus with few side effects, but health officials, insurers and Medicaid directors are balking at the cost. The national cost of treating even two-thirds of the estimated 3.2 million people with the virus could reach $200 billion. This has focused scrutiny on U.S. drug prices, which outstrip the rest of the world. Biotechnology shares were already in the midst of a selloff when U.S. lawmakers asked on March 21 for Gilead Sciences to explain the price for the Sovaldi treatment. Since then, shares of Gilead have lost more than 7 percent as investors feared that regulators and insurers would pressure the company to restrain prices. It pulled other biotech stocks down in tandem and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index has dropped nearly 14 percent since March 20. Some doctors and health officials say the drug’s cost must be viewed in comparison to spending on treating liver disease or on liver transplants, which can be more expensive and may not prevent a relapse in hepatitis C. Daniel Schumacher, chief financial officer of the group’s UnitedHealthcare division, said the spending on Sovaldi could begin to moderate after the first big wave of patients are treated with the drug. He did not disclose what it had anticipated spending on the hepatitis C drug but said the cost “is a multiple of what we had expected.” Because Sovaldi is widely viewed as a breakthrough in treating the liver-wasting virus in typically as few as 12 weeks, many doctors had waited for the drug before prescribing treatment to patients. “What we’re seeing is ... higher pent-up demand as there were more patients that were warehoused leading up to the launch,” Schumacher said. UnitedHealth saw increased spending levels due to Sovaldi in its Medicaid, Medicare and commercial businesses during the first quarter of 2014, he said. A Gilead spokeswoman declined to comment. Schumacher said the company is working with state Medicaid directors, whose agencies could bear much of the cost because they cover a disproportionate share of people with the virus, and expects to be reimbursed at some point. State Medicaid directors are pushing Gilead for discounts, but it so far has refused to give much ground. Medicaid receives at least a mandatory 23 percent discount from pharmaceutical makers, but states can negotiate for more cuts. Some insurers, such as pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co, has said it will use anticipated products from AbbVie Inc and Merck & Co as price leverage with Gilead. UnitedHealth said its quarterly profit was cut by 35 cents a share due to costs and taxes related to President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, more formally known as the Affordable Care Act, and government cuts to private Medicare funding. The hepatitis C cost is one of several new pressures UnitedHealth said it has an eye on this year including commercial premium prices in several markets. In New York, which is also a large market for WellPoint, it said new competitors were underpricing at unsustainable levels. “This is really the first look of anyone operating under the full brunt of ACA-mandated cuts and sequestration and you have to revise your thinking a little bit,” CRT Capital analyst Sheryl Skolnick said. UnitedHealth, a small player on the Obamacare exchanges created by that reform law in 2014, said that it had a “bias” towards expansion in 2015. Insurers must submit new plans and rates to the federal government by the end of June if they want to participate. The company’s quarterly results slightly beat analyst expectations. UnitedHealth said net profit was $1.1 billion, or about $1.10 per share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $1.16 per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected first quarter profit of $1.09 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. UnitedHealth stuck by its previous forecast for 2014 earnings of $5.40 to $5.60 per share and said it sees revenue growth of about 5 percent to $128 billion to $129 billion.

154,GILD,England agrees funding for Gilead hepatitis C drug,"LONDON, April 17 (Reuters) - Health authorities in England have approved an 18.7 million pound ($31 million) investment to provide Gilead Sciences’ controversial new hepatitis C pill Sovaldi for seriously ill patients. Healthcare provider NHS England said the decision would benefit about 500 patients suffering from acute liver failure, many of whom are awaiting a liver transplant. The recommendation means that while Sovaldi has not yet been approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), the country’s cost-effectiveness watchdog, it will be funded for those patients at significant risk of dying. NICE is due to publish its guidance on whether Sovaldi is worth using widely on the state-run National Health Service later this year. Sovaldi is far more effective and better-tolerated than older treatments, but its high cost has provoked criticism from healthcare campaigners and insurers. The current U.S. price for a 12-week course of treatment with Sovaldi is $84,000, or $1,000 for each once-daily pill, but Gilead has said the price in Britain will be about $57,000.

155,GILD,"Gilead profit triples, hepatitis C drug sales beat by $1 billion","(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O), which has ignited a fierce debate over prescription drug prices, said its new $1,000 hepatitis C pill generated record-breaking sales of $2.27 billion, helping the company’s quarterly net profit nearly triple. The Foster City, California-based company on Tuesday posted an adjusted profit of $1.48 a share, soundly beating the average Wall Street estimate of 91 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “It’s pretty remarkable that they can generate $2.3 billion in revenue (from hepatitis C drug Sovaldi) in the first 3 months on the market,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges. “People’s numbers are going to go up dramatically for this year and next for Gilead.” Analysts had expected Sovaldi sales of $1.01 billion, according to Deutsche Bank. The drug’s quarterly sales of over $2 billion are the highest ever for a new medicine, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. Shares of Gilead, which rose 1.8 percent to close at $72.86, were up another 2 percent at $74.62 after hours. The shares have more than doubled over the past two years, but have fallen some 15 percent since their high for the year in late February. Gilead’s decision to price Sovaldi, which was approved by U.S. regulators in December, at $84,000 for a 12-week course of therapy has rankled lawmakers and insurers, spurring an outcry over the rising costs of specialty medicines. Investor concern over the pricing complaints has pressured shares of Gilead, as well as the wider biotech sector. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index .NBI has fallen about 5 percent so far this year. But sales of the drug led to a tripling of Gilead’s first quarter net income to $2.23 billion from $722 million a year earlier. The company’s revenue doubled to $5 billion, beating by a wide margin the $3.98 billion average Wall Street analyst forecast. Gilead continued to exclude sales of Sovaldi and other hepatitis C drugs from its forecast for 2014 product sales, which it still expects to total between $11.3 billion and $11.5 billion. John Milligan, Gilead’s chief operating officer, said during a conference call with analysts and investors that the drug has been “priced appropriately based on its benefit.” Gilead is awaiting U.S. approval for a combination of Sovaldi and experimental drug ledipasvir that would allow more patients to be cured of the virus with a single-pill regimen. The company’s pricing for that “simpler” regimen will take into account the additional benefit it provides, Milligan said. UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), the largest U.S. health insurer, said last week that its first quarter costs to cover Sovaldi were much higher than expected, but it anticipated spending would moderate after the first big wave of patients are treated with the drug. Pharmacy plan manager Express Scripts (ESRX.O) suggested its clients should stop using Sovaldi once rival products are on the market. Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives, led by California’s Henry Waxman, have asked Gilead to explain the pricing on Sovaldi. Before the new drug was available, patients infected with the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus had to be treated for at least six months with several drugs, including interferon, an injected medicine that can cause severe flu-like symptoms, and ribavirin, which can casue rash, anemia and other side effects. Those regimens were shown in clinical trials to cure around 75 percent of patients, compared with Sovaldi’s cure rate of more than 90 percent. Around 3.2 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The World Health Organization estimates that globally, 150 million people are infected with the virus.

Netflix Inc surged 7 percent to $372.90 a day after reporting strong subscriber growth, a sign the trading favorite still had room to grow despite recent valuation concerns. With the day’s gain, the stock moved to the plus side for the year after a 21 percent drop in March. The S&P; healthcare index, up 1 percent, was the best performer of the 10 major S&P; sectors. Allergan Inc  jumped 15.2 percent to $163.65 a day after activist investor William Ackman teamed up with Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc  to bid for the company. U.S.-listed Valeant shares gained 7.5 percent to $135.41. A deal between Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline , in which the two traded over $20 billion worth of assets in an effort to cope with healthcare spending cuts and generic competition, also bolstered the healthcare sector. U.S.-listed shares of Novartis gained 1.3 percent to $86.56, while Glaxo rose 4.1 percent to $55.30. Better-than-expected earnings have lifted stocks recently, though companies have largely been exceeding reduced forecasts. Profits are seen rising 1.1 percent this quarter, down from the 6.5 percent growth rate estimated at the start of the year. “What was baked into the market, in spite of a market near an all-time high, was a sloppy earnings season,” said Mike Serio, regional chief investment officer of Wells Fargo Private Bank in Denver. “We’ve had some really good beats at this point, we’ve had a couple of good announcements today, you throw on the M&A; activity in the drug sector, at least in the short term, everybody looks pretty excited about this market.” Dow components Travelers Cos Inc and United Technologies Corp both beat expectations, and United Tech raised the low end of its full-year profit outlook. Shares of Travelers rose 0.6 percent to $86.89 while United Tech added 0.8 percent to end at $119.19.

On the revenue side, 51 percent have exceeded forecasts, below the 61 percent long-term average. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 65.12 points or 0.40 percent, to end at 16,514.37. The S&P; 500 gained 7.66 points or 0.41 percent, to 1,879.55. The Nasdaq Composite  added 39.912 points or 0.97 percent, to 4,161.458. After the close, Gilead Sciences Inc advanced 1.1 percent to $73.65 after the drugmaker said its new $1,000 hepatitis C pill generated quarterly sales of $2.27 billion, helping the company’s quarterly net profit nearly triple. In another positive sign for equities, the Dow Jones Transportation Average, up 0.6 percent, closed at its first record high since April 2. The index got a boost from airlines such as United Continental Holdings, up 4.6 percent, and Alaska Air Group Inc, up 1.3 percent, which rose on a 2 percent drop in oil prices.

AT&T; Inc fell 3.8 percent to $34.92 a day after the Dow component reported earnings that beat expectations, offset by weak service revenue growth. Verizon Communications  shed 1 percent to $47.43 while the S&P; telecom sector index  dropped 2.2 percent, easily making it the session’s worst-performing sector. Biotech shares pulled the Nasdaq lower. Amgen Inc  slid 5 percent to $113.32, a day after earnings missed forecasts. The Nasdaq biotech index fell 1.5 percent and NYSEArca biotech index lost 1.6 percent. “You’ve got some big numbers coming out from companies that have already been pretty volatile in the Nasdaq, and there is some caution against the potential for shortfalls that could restart Nasdaq on the way down,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. “This is traditionally not going to be a particularly strong time for earnings reports, and it’s easy to take less inspiring numbers and say this market is overvalued or pass them by and say this is a seasonally low point. So it really is more about investors’ own view of how high a multiple they are willing to pay.” There were bright spots within biotech. Gilead Sciences Inc  rose 1.4 percent to $73.86 and Illumina Inc  gained 3.9 percent to $153.69 after the companies posted results late Tuesday. Boeing Co reported first-quarter revenue that beat expectations and lifted its core earnings forecast to reflect a tax settlement gain, sending its stock up 2.4 percent to $130.63 and giving the biggest boost to the Dow. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.72 points or 0.08 percent, to end at 16,501.65. The S&P; 500 lost 4.16 points or 0.22 percent, to 1,875.39. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 34.491 points or 0.83 percent, to 4,126.967.

In another big move after the close, Facebook Inc  gained 4.8 percent to $64.30.

Guertin said the costs were in line with the company’s expectations. Most of it was in its commercial business and in Medicare Part D, the government program in which private insurers manage drug benefits. Medicaid-related Sovaldi costs accounted for the smallest portion of that $30 million, he said, as some states continue to develop policies on the drug and because some states where it operates do not use private insurance to pay for any pharmaceutical benefits.

166,GILD,UPDATE 1-Vertex says cystic fibrosis drugs shown to boost lung function,"(Adds analyst comment, details, background, byline, updates share price) By Deena Beasley May 1 (Reuters) - Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc on Thursday said a combination of its cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco and an experimental compound was shown to improve lung function in a mid-stage trial, sending its shares up nearly 8 percent. The study found that treatment with Kalydeco and the experimental drug VX-661 for 28 days resulted in a 4.6 percentage point improvement in mean lung function for patients with two specific genetic mutations. VX-661 would be the second drug from Vertex that works by treating the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disease that impairs the lungs and digestive system. The disease is caused by defective or missing CF transmembrane conductane regulator (CFTR) proteins. Kalydeco is designed for patients with the most common CFTR mutation, while VX-661 aims to treat patients with a different mutation that affects protein function. The Phase 2 trial involved patients with both mutations who were already taking Kalydeco. “It is good data and some believe it does have an incremental positive read-through to the all-important Phase 3 data later this summer,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. That trial will answer the question of whether a combination of Vertex drugs is effective in patients with two copies of the gene mutation not currently addressed by Kalydeco - a market representing about half of the 30,000 cystic fibrosis patients in the United States. A positive result “would be transformative to the cystic fibrosis community,” Yee said. The most common side effects seen during the Phase 2 trial included cough, headache and upper respiratory tract infection. But ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum cautioned that Vertex has not disclosed results from the mid-stage trial for patients treated with a placebo. Vertex also announced that first quarter sales of Kalydeco totaled $100 million, which fell short of the average analyst estimate of $107 million, according to Wells Fargo Securities. Separately, The company reported an adjusted first quarter loss of $1.00 per share, also below the average analyst per-share loss estimate of 67 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Vertex said it would discontinue research into treatments for hepatitis C, a market now dominated by sales of Gilead Sciences Inc’s Sovaldi. Vertex late last year sold off its non-North America royalty rights to hepatitis C drug Incivek. Shares of Vertex, which closed at $68.95 in regular Nasdaq trading, were up $5.30 at $74.25 after hours.

169,GILD,Major U.S. hedge funds sold 'momentum' Internet names in 1st qtr,"NEW YORK, May 15 (Reuters) - Top hedge funds shed their stakes in high-profile Internet names such as Netflix Inc  and Groupon Inc in the first quarter, moving to peers viewed as more mature and less volatile. High-growth Internet software and biotech companies were the darlings of 2013, but their shares started to fall sharply in early March. Netflix, last year’s biggest S&P; 500 gainer and an important hedge fund holding, is down more than 24 percent from its closing high this year. Hedge funds invested in technology and healthcare fell 3.65 percent in April, the biggest monthly decline since October 2008 and extending March’s 1.8 percent decline, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Among prominent hedge fund managers, Carl Icahn cut his holding in Netflix by 15.8 percent in the first quarter, reducing it to about 2.2 million shares. Tiger Global Management sold its entire stake of 663,000 shares during the quarter. Netflix was up on the year for most of the first quarter, so the fund is likely to have sold at the right time. Tiger also dumped its stake of 11.46 million shares in Groupon. That position was worth $134.9 million at the end of 2013 and $89.9 million at the end of the quarter. The Internet software and services sector now accounts for about 10 percent of the top 100 long positions for equity/long short hedge funds, down from 20 percent to 25 percent in January, according to Credit Suisse data. Long/short hedge fund managers moved to short bets in Internet names amid a meltdown in the group, according to Credit Suisse. Long positions in the group now account for about 25 percent of the overall gross exposure to the group, which adds together both long and short positions. That’s the lowest rate in at least three years. Some funds added to their “momentum” exposure, with Jana Partners increasing its stake in Groupon by almost 32 percent to 40.8 million shares. Other funds moved to technology names with less lofty valuations and that are viewed as more established. Third Point sold its stakes in both Yahoo Inc and biotech company Gilead Sciences Inc but increased its Google Inc  holdings by 31.3 percent. EBay Inc, which became a darling among top U.S. hedge funds in the fourth quarter just before billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn urged the company to spin off its PayPal business, continued to find fans in the first quarter. Omega more than tripled its stake in eBay, bringing it to 2.9 million shares, while Jana opened a stake of 3.9 million shares in the first quarter. Icahn, who backed down from his demands, disclosed a new stake in eBay, holding 27.8 million shares as of March 31.

170,GILD,U.S. health insurers say Gilead hepatitis C drug too costly,"(Reuters) - The leading U.S. health insurance trade group on Tuesday hit out at the extremely high cost of new specialty medicines, accusing drugmakers of taking advantage of the insurance system by pricing products at unsustainable levels. The latest salvo in the war on escalating U.S. healthcare costs came from AHIP - America’s Health Insurance Plans - and targeted Sovaldi, the new $84,000 hepatitis C treatment from Gilead Sciences Inc. “Sovaldi has shown tremendous results, and it’s the kind of medical innovation we need to sustain. Unfortunately, the drug’s maker has priced it at an astronomical level that is not sustainable for consumers, innovation, or society,” AHIP said on its Coverage blog. Sovaldi is the first in a new wave of all-oral treatments for the liver disease that has been a tremendous advance over prior treatments. The new drug has demonstrated an ability to cure well over 90 percent of patients in just 12 weeks or less with few side effects. Prior to the Sovaldi approval, hepatitis C treatments took 24 or 48 weeks, cured about 75 percent of patients and involved many more pills as well as injectable interferon that causes flu-like symptoms and other side effects that led many people to avoid or discontinue treatment. But concern that hundreds of thousands of patients will  seek treatment with the Gilead drug that costs roughly $1,000 per pill has provided a rallying point for insurers and others seeking to rein in the skyrocketing cost of new medicines in the United States, which has no price controls on drugs, unlike Europe and other countries. In its first full quarter on the market, Sovaldi had more than $2 billion in sales, shattering previous pharmaceutical records. Cara Miller, a spokeswoman for Gilead, defended the drug’s pricing in an emailed statement: “While Sovaldi greatly enhances the standard of care for hepatitis C, it was priced such that the total regimen cost is equal to that of prior standard of care regimens.    “Sovaldi reduces total treatment costs for HCV – taking into account the cost of medications (including those for side effects or complications) and healthcare visits – and it represents a finite cure, an important point to consider when comparing the price of a pill or bottle to the lifetime costs of treating a chronic disease.” The campaign against Gilead may also be an effort to pressure other drugmakers, such as Merck & Co, AbbVie and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, before they set prices for their hepatitis C drugs that are expected to gain regulatory approval in the next year or two.

171,GILD,UPDATE 1-U.S. health insurers say Gilead hepatitis C drug too costly,"(Adds response from Gilead Sciences in paragraphs 8-9) May 20 (Reuters) - The leading U.S. health insurance trade group on Tuesday hit out at the extremely high cost of new specialty medicines, accusing drugmakers of taking advantage of the insurance system by pricing products at unsustainable levels. The latest salvo in the war on escalating U.S. healthcare costs came from AHIP - America’s Health Insurance Plans - and targeted Sovaldi, the new $84,000 hepatitis C treatment from Gilead Sciences Inc. “Sovaldi has shown tremendous results, and it’s the kind of medical innovation we need to sustain. Unfortunately, the drug’s maker has priced it at an astronomical level that is not sustainable for consumers, innovation, or society,” AHIP said on its Coverage blog. Sovaldi is the first in a new wave of all-oral treatments for the liver disease that has been a tremendous advance over prior treatments. The new drug has demonstrated an ability to cure well over 90 percent of patients in just 12 weeks or less with few side effects. Prior to the Sovaldi approval, hepatitis C treatments took 24 or 48 weeks, cured about 75 percent of patients and involved many more pills as well as injectable interferon that causes flu-like symptoms and other side effects that led many people to avoid or discontinue treatment. But concern that hundreds of thousands of patients will  seek treatment with the Gilead drug that costs roughly $1,000 per pill has provided a rallying point for insurers and others seeking to rein in the skyrocketing cost of new medicines in the United States, which has no price controls on drugs, unlike Europe and other countries. In its first full quarter on the market, Sovaldi had more than $2 billion in sales, shattering previous pharmaceutical records. Cara Miller, a spokeswoman for Gilead, defended the drug’s pricing in an emailed statement: “While Sovaldi greatly enhances the standard of care for hepatitis C, it was priced such that the total regimen cost is equal to that of prior standard of care regimens. “Sovaldi reduces total treatment costs for HCV - taking into account the cost of medications (including those for side effects or complications) and healthcare visits - and it represents a finite cure, an important point to consider when comparing the price of a pill or bottle to the lifetime costs of treating a chronic disease.” The campaign against Gilead may also be an effort to pressure other drugmakers, such as Merck & Co, AbbVie  and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, before they set prices for their hepatitis C drugs that are expected to gain regulatory approval in the next year or two. AHIP said promising new drugs are being priced in a way that threatens Americans’ access to them. “We need to find a solution that ensures important drugs like Sovaldi are priced at sustainable levels so that we can foster even more life-saving innovation.” John Castellani, chief executive of PhRMA, the leading pharmaceutical industry trade group, said the problem is an insurance system that pushes too much of the cost of treatment onto the patient with high co-pays and deductibles for drugs. “The insurance model makes medicine seem like the most expensive part of the healthcare system,” Castellani said.

176,GILD,Britain's cost agency not ready to back Gilead hepatitis C drug,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s healthcare cost-effectiveness watchdog said on Monday it needed more information about Gilead Sciences’ pricey new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi before deciding if it should be used on the state health service. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said it was “minded not to recommend” the drug, which is also known as sofosbuvir. The decision poses a hurdle to its widespread adoption in Britain. “The available evidence shows that sofosbuvir is an effective treatment for chronic hepatitis C in certain patients,” said Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Health Technology Evaluation. “However, evidence is lacking for some subgroups of patients with chronic hepatitis C, and there are also substantial uncertainties in the evidence base presented by the manufacturer.” Meanwhile, Gilead released more data on Sovaldi in combination with its second hepatitis C drug ledipasvir that should make it more difficult for NICE to reject. In a Japanese study of patients with the most common and often difficult to treat Genotype 1 form of the virus, the Sovaldi/ledipasvir combination demonstrated a 100 percent cure rate - 83 of 83 previously untreated patients and all 88 of those who had not been helped by prior treatment - with 12 weeks of therapy. Once ledipasvir gains approval, the combination with Sovaldi  is expected to become a one pill, once a day treatment regimen sold by Gilead.  Sovaldi is far more effective and better-tolerated than older treatments, but its high cost has provoked criticism from healthcare campaigners and insurers. The U.S. price for a 12-week course of treatment with Sovaldi is $84,000, or $1,000 for each once-daily pill. The price in Britain has been set lower at around 35,000 pounds ($58,800). Gilead and the pharmaceutical industry trade group has argued that the price is justified by the near guarantee of a cure, far fewer side effects and the treatment’s ability to help patients avoid far more expensive hospitalizations for liver failure and the need for transplants as the disease progresses.($1 = 0.5956 British Pounds) ",6162014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gilead-sciences-britain/britains-cost-agency-not-ready-to-back-gilead-hepatitis-c-drug-idUSKBN0ER24E20140616

180,GILD,A 4-week hep C cure? Bristol to test drugs with Gilead's Sovaldi,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the race to find a faster cure for hepatitis C, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said it will test its experimental antiviral drug combination with Gilead Sciences Inc’s blockbuster drug Sovaldi, hoping to cut treatment time to four weeks. Bristol-Myers disclosed plans for the exploratory 30-patient trial testing its three-drug combination with Sovaldi in an interview with Reuters. Eric Hughes, the leader of Bristol’s global hepatitis program, said the details were due to be posted on the clinicaltrials.gov website next week.  Sovaldi’s $84,000 price tag for a 12-week treatment has spurred outrage among insurers, state health officials and lawmakers who fear the cost of treating millions of Americans with the progressive liver disease will top $250 billion. Insurers are pushing Gilead’s rivals to offer lower prices when their hepatitis C medicines reach the market.  Using the drug for a shorter course of treatment could, in theory, lower the cost, even when combined with Bristol’s therapies. Rivals Merck & Co and AbbVie are also racing to develop next-generation hepatitis C treatments that cure most people of the virus in a shorter time frame. But drug pricing experts expect Gilead and its rivals may still argue that the quicker cure represents a value to patients, buffering any steep price reductions. “The position and concept of pharma is not ingredient costs or duration of treatment cost. Pharma is looking at it as cost per cure,” said John Whang, co-president of Reimbursement Intelligence, which works with pharmaceutical companies and payers to help determine prices for medicines. The cost could come down, he said, “but it’s not going to be proportionate to the degree that the duration of treatment shortens.”  The new generation of oral drugs being developed by several companies has raised hepatitis C cure rates to well above 90 percent from about 75 percent without the need for interferon or ribavirin, which caused miserable side effects that led many patients to delay or drop treatment. The drugs in clinical trials have already cut treatment time to 12 weeks from 24 to 48 weeks.  “We got rid of the tolerability problem. We got rid of the efficacy problem. Now there is a tremendous drive to get down to shorter treatment durations,” Bristol-Myers’ Hughes said in a telephone interview. Bristol’s plan essentially revives an effort to test its drugs in combination with Sovaldi. It previously tested a single compound with Sovaldi, achieving cure rates close to 100 percent in 12 weeks. But Gilead scrapped further testing in 2012, as it  preferred to develop its own combination without a partner. Gilead’s pill that combines Sovaldi with its ledipasvir is expected to gain U.S. approval this year for therapies of eight or 12 weeks, depending on the patient. The company is also testing the combination as a six-week treatment. The go-it-alone strategy has already paid off as Gilead was first to market with Sovaldi, breaking pharmaceutical industry sales records with $2.3 billion in sales within a few months.  The new study, set to begin in late July, will test a trio of Bristol drugs with Sovaldi in previously untreated patients with the most common Genotype 1 form of the virus. It will involve two groups of 15 patients each - one getting four weeks of treatment and the other six.  If Bristol can demonstrate cure rates in excess of 90 percent in four weeks, it plans to conduct larger trials with a more diverse patient population. “We’ll see what the data says,” Hughes said. “Taking this forward will be a very exciting thing.”        With Gilead not involved in the effort, Bristol will pay full price for Sovaldi to conduct the trial. Bristol would not discuss potential pricing of its regimen, since its drugs are not approved. But if treatment can be cut to four weeks from 12, the Sovaldi portion would be closer to $28,000.  Other rivals are also advancing efforts to compete in what is expected to be a huge market. Merck this month agreed to pay $3.85 billion to acquire Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc with the hope that combining the two companies’ most promising drugs will produce cures in four to six weeks across the full spectrum of genotypes. U.S. and European health regulators in the last week said they would accelerate their reviews of AbbVie’s four-drug regimen, meaning it could be vying for market share by early next year.

182,GILD,U.S. senators ask Gilead to explain cost of Sovaldi hepatitis drug,"(Reuters) - Two members of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, including Chairman Ron Wyden, on Friday asked Gilead Sciences Inc to defend the more than $80,000 cost of its breakthrough  treatment for hepatitis C, citing the expense to federal healthcare programs. “Given the impact Sovaldi’s cost will have on Medicare, Medicaid and other federal spending, we need a better understanding of how your company arrived at the price for this drug,” the lawmakers said in a release. “It is unclear how Gilead set the price for Sovaldi.” Sovaldi’s cost can soar to $168,000 in patients that need longer treatment periods, not including the costs of other drugs used with it, the senators said.  Gilead acquired Sovaldi (sufosbuvir) in 2012 by paying more than $11 billion for Pharmasset Inc. The deal began to bear fruit after Sovaldi produced stellar results in late-stage clinical trials and was approved by U.S. regulators late last year.  The nucleotide analog inhibitor, or “nuke,” blocks a protein needed by the hepatitis C virus to replicate. Other companies, including Merck & Co, are developing their own nukes and other new types of hepatitis C treatments. The criticism from the two senators follows complaints from private healthcare insurers about the price of the most potent new treatment for the dangerous liver disease, which affects more than 3 million Americans. Gilead’s pill, which cures patients more quickly than older drugs, and with fewer side effects, captured $2.3 billion in sales during its first full quarter on the market, a record for the drug industry. The drugmaker has defended the price, saying Sovaldi reduces overall treatment costs for hepatitis C by lowering the number of required healthcare visits and sidestepping the need for other medicines that treat side effects of older therapies. Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, and committee member Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, said in a letter to Gilead Chief Executive Officer John Martin that Sovaldi’s price could also dramatically increase the cost of caring for an estimated 1.8 million prisoners infected with the hepatitis C virus.  The senators said Pharmasset, before being acquired by Gilead, had expected to profitably sell the drug in the United States for $36,000, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents.

185,GILD,Gilead hepatitis C drug Sovaldi racks up $3.5 billion in quarter,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc said on Wednesday that its new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi had sales of $3.5 billion in the second quarter, demonstrating that the furor over its price has not curtailed early use. Analysts had been forecasting Sovaldi sales of about $2.6 to $2.9 billion for the quarter. In its first two industry record shattering quarters on the market, Sovaldi has racked up sales of $5.8 billion despite reports that thousands of patients are still waiting for Gilead’s two drugs in one pill combination treatment expected to gain U.S. approval in October.  Since its December launch, Sovaldi has been prescribed for more than 80,000 patients in the United States and Europe, the company said. It said it expects to file for approval of Sovaldi in Japan in the fourth quarter. Sovaldi has been a lightning rod for a fierce debate over drug prices. Its $84,000 cost for 12-weeks of treatment that works out to $1,000 per pill has caused concerns that high demand will place a huge burden on government-run health plans and private insurers. A prominent U.S. health insurer trade group called on Gilead to lower the Sovaldi cost.    “While it was a blockbuster quarter for Gilead, people who can’t access the drug because of its price didn’t fare nearly as well,” Brendan Buck, spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement. Only three U.S. states are not yet covering Sovaldi pending further review, Gilead said.  Gilead has argued that Sovaldi’s price is comparable to older medicines that require far longer treatment duration with much lower cure rates and nasty side effects. “Sovaldi is a remarkable drug. We are curing people of a horrible disease in a very rapid time period,” said Chief Operating Officer John Milligan, adding that Gilead is complying with requests from U.S. Senators for pricing information.  Gilead and others are testing drug combinations that could cut treatment to as few as 4 to 6 weeks while maintaining cure rates in excess of 90 percent. While calls for price cuts have driven down Gilead’s share price at times, the criticism is not all bad in the company’s view. “The controversy around Sovaldi is a constant reminder to patients that there is a new treatment option out there,” Milligan said. Gilead shares slipped to $89.85 in extended trading from a Nasdaq close at $90.34. Gilead said its net profit soared to $3.66 billion, or $2.20 per share, from $772.6 million, or 46 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items, the company earned $2.36 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 57 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Gilead said it now expects 2014 revenue of $21 billion to $23 billion. Excluding Sovaldi, it had previously forecast sales of $11.3 billion to $11.5 billion. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee suggested shares were down due to a conservative forecast that implied flat Sovaldi sales in the second half. “I don’t think there’s any reason for Gilead to want to parade around a huge projected number for the full year given a lot of (pricing) focus by press and government and payers,” he said. Revenue for the quarter was $6.53 billion, topping analysts’  estimates of $5.86 billion, as Gilead’s newer HIV drugs also saw solid sales growth. “What’s remarkable is that their expenses didn’t increase, so you see this spectacular earnings beat,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said. Earlier on Wednesday, Gilead won U.S. approval of its first oncology product, Zydelig (idelalisib), for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and two other blood cancers.

189,GILD,U.S. FDA approves Gilead blood cancer drug Zydelig,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday it has approved Gilead Sciences Inc’s Zydelig, a drug to treat three types of blood cancer. The FDA approved the use of Zydelig in combination with Roche AG’s Rituxan for patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).  It also approved Zydelig under a so-called accelerated approval program for relapsed follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma, when patients  have received at least two prior therapies. For drugs given accelerated approval, companies must conduct additional trials to confirm that the drug’s apparent benefit is real. Zydelig, known generically as idealisib, will carry a boxed warning highlighting the risk of serious and potentially fatal toxicities, including liver toxicity, diarrhea, inflammation of the colon and lung, and perforation of the intestine. It will be marketed using a special risk management program. “We believe this broad boxed warning will lead docs to be cautious with this drug,” Joseph Pantginis, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners, said in a research note. Shares of Gilead rose 0.4 percent to $89.66 in afternoon trading. Shares of Pharmacyclics Inc, which makes a rival product, Imbruvica, for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma and does not carry a boxed warning or risk management program, rose 8.8 percent to $105.05. Geoff Porges, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, forecasts revenue for Zydelig growing to $1.5 billion in 2017, higher than the consensus estimate for that year of $990 million. “Gilead has global rights to the product, and are likely to commercialize it for multiple indications and subtypes of NHL as well as CLL,” Porges said in a research report. Porges said his more optimistic view on the drug is based on its activity in indolent NHL and lead in this disease over Imbruvica and other drugs in the class.

196,GILD,A mixed quarter for bets on U.S. stock volatility,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - With some of Wall Street’s more volatile names set to report in the next couple of days, traders who bet on big swings in shares are hoping to see moves more like Facebook than Netflix. Netflix, along with Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) and several other stocks famous for their sharp gyrations, were unusually calm following their latest quarterly reports. However, Amazon.com and Facebook have had big days after their reports, heightening expectations for upcoming releases from Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) and Expedia Inc (EXPE.O). For volatility investors, the direction of the move is not important, just the magnitude. Traders use an option strategy known as a straddle - buying a bullish call option and a bearish put option at the same strike price - in a bet that a stock will move by a certain amount. Even if a stock rises, the trader can lose money if it moves less than implied by the combined cost of the put and call options. On average, the realized stock change on earnings is about 1.5 percent lower than expected, according to derivatives strategists at Credit Suisse in New York. “Many of the companies that are typically volatile have had in-line numbers, which wouldn’t result in a materially volatile stocks afterwards,” said Doug Kass, president of Seabreeze Partners in Palm Beach, Florida.      Expedia and Tesla are both due to report results on Thursday. Over the past eight quarters, both have averaged a move of about 15 percent following results, according to Thomson Reuters data. Based on where they traded on Monday, investors expect a move of 9.4 percent for Expedia and 7.8 percent for Tesla. Investors trading options in 3D Systems Corp (DDD.N), scheduled to report on Wednesday, are looking for an 11 percent move in shares, compared with the eight-quarter median of 6 percent, according to Goldman Sachs. Recent days have seen more volatility among individual names. Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) on Friday tumbled almost 10 percent following results, while both Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.N) soared to records. Amazon lost more than $34 on the day after reporting results. The options market had priced in a $22 move. Facebook shares rose as much as $5.45, beyond the $4.92 move estimated by the options market, said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. Still, moves like these have been the exception this season, in an environment where the CBOE Volatility index .VIX is less than 13, well below its historical average of 20. Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) fell 5 percent in the week after its results, less than a third of its nearly 19 percent average move over the past eight quarters. “One might expect a little more volatility to the downside, which we haven’t seen,” said Peter Cecchini, managing director and chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. “We could be in a calm before the storm, there’s a lot of complacency.”  Google Inc (GOOGL.O) rose 2.5 percent in the week after its results, less than half the 5.5 percent average over the past eight quarters. F5 Networks Inc (FFIV.O) rose 1.7 percent, below its 7.85 percent average. Gilead Sciences averaged a one-day move of 2.85 percent in the last six quarters; this time out, it gained just 1.1 percent.   Apple Inc (AAPL.O) rose 4.8 percent in the seven sessions following earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data, below the 6.4 percent average over the past eight quarters. “Last quarter the people who played an Apple straddle really got rewarded,” said Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas. Apple gained 11.4 percent in the week after results.  “This time they bid it up too much, and those people got beat up.” Sarhan said that selling volatility in high-growth names can still be dangerous, even in a quiet market.  “You’re going into a situation where you know these names have had big moves in the past,” he said.

203,GILD,"Gilead to raise price for new hepatitis C drug above $84,000","LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The next generation version of Gilead Sciences Inc’s $84,000 hepatitis C drug, already under fire for its record-breaking costs, is going to be even more expensive. Gregg Alton, Gilead’s executive vice president of corporate and medical affairs, declined to give an exact price for the new medicine, the first all-oral treatment for the virus which is expected to launch next month.  The total cost of the current treatment is $95,000, which includes Sovaldi and two older medicines, ribavirin and interferon, according to Gilead. The price of the new drug would be based on that cost, Alton said in an interview.  “We are going to price this fixed-dose regimen based on those costs,” Alton said. “We do plan on launching a better product without having a significant premium.” Health insurers, U.S. state authorities and congressional lawmakers have pleaded with Gilead to offer a greater discount for Sovaldi as the cost of treating more than 3 million U.S. patients are expected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars.  The drugmaker is expected to rake in nearly $12 billion in hepatitis C drug sales worldwide in 2014. Sovaldi sales have been unprecedented for any drug in its first year on the market.  “The blank check mindset we’ve seen from Gilead is a threat to our entire health care system, and we hope they will pursue more sustainable pricing in the future,” said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for the insurance industry’s largest lobbying group, America’s Health Insurance Plans. Gilead expects savings for some patients in its pricing scheme. It said that nearly half of hepatitis C patients - previously untreated, healthier individuals - can be cured after eight weeks of using the new pill, compared with 12 weeks for the current Sovaldi regimen. That would effectively cut the treatment cost by one-third for such patients.  U.S. health regulators are due to decide by Oct. 10 whether to approve the new drug, a pill that combines Sovaldi with the experimental therapy ledipasvir and eliminates the need for other treatments. It has been shown to cure up to 99 percent of patients versus 90 percent for Sovaldi plus ribavirin and interferon, which also cause hard-to-tolerate side effects. But the fact that a shorter treatment time for some will equate to a lower drug price may disappoint some investors. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum on Friday lowered his average price estimate per patient to $85,000 from $100,000 to account for it. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee estimates that the new Gilead drug will be priced at $95,000 for 12 weeks, while Sanford Bernstein’s Geoff Porges anticipated a list price of $100,000. Alton noted that the new drug will be priced below the current cost of Sovaldi plus Olysio, a daily protease inhibitor sold by Johnson & Johnson. Although it is not FDA-approved, some doctors have been prescribing Sovaldi in combination with Olysio, costing up to $150,000. But J. Mario Molina, chief executive officer at insurer Molina Healthcare Inc, says the drug should cost no more than $45,000 per patient, based on his estimate of how many patients it may save from severe liver disease.     “Yes, it will save lives and prevent people from having a liver transplant, but not very many,” Molina said. “If I said, you give me $9 million and I will give you $4 million or $5 million back, would you do that? That’s what Gilead is doing.” Hepatitis C kills more than 15,000 Americans each year, mostly from illnesses such as cirrhosis and liver cancer, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The often-undiagnosed virus is transmitted through contaminated blood. While infection rates have dropped since the early 1990s - due in part to the introduction of blood and organ screening - many older adults remain at risk. The CDC has called for baby boomers to be routinely tested. Gilead estimates that around 400,000 Americans diagnosed with the virus are currently under a doctor’s care. “We are probably looking at 150,000 being treated this year, maybe slightly more - say 200,000 - next year,” Alton said.  He estimates it will take three years to treat the diagnosed population, including newly identified patients, and about 20 years for hepatitis C to be eradicated.

206,GILD,Gilead signs hepatitis C pact to cut drug cost for poor,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O has licensed its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi to seven India-based drugmakers that will sell far cheaper versions of the $1,000-a-pill medicine in 91 developing nations. Approximately 150 million people in the world live with chronic hepatitis C infection, most of them in low and middle-income countries, and the new licenses are designed to give many of them access to an otherwise unaffordable drug. As with AIDS 15 years ago, modern drugs are transforming the ability to fight hepatitis C, and Sovaldi has been hailed as a breakthrough in treating the liver-destroying virus. Sovaldi, chemically known as sofosbuvir, is a far more effective and better-tolerated treatment than older injection regimens, but Gilead has come under fire over its U.S. price tag, with cost presenting a huge barrier in poor countries. Gilead said it would also launch its own branded Sovaldi in India at a price of $300 a month. The drug is normally given for either three or six months and costs $84,000 for a 12-week course in the United States. Gilead’s next-generation version is going to be even more expensive. Gilead’s licensing agreement with firms including India’s Cipla CIPL.NS and Ranbaxy Laboratories RANB.NS clears the way for the launch of cheap generic versions of the drug in 91 developing countries, including India, which make up 54 percent of the total global hepatitis-infected population. Cadila Healthcare CADI.NS, Sequent Scientific SEQU.BO, Strides Arcolab STAR.NS, Hetero Drugs and Mylan Laboratories, owned by U.S.-based Mylan MYL.O, are the others who will now be able to make and sell the Sovaldi generic, Gilead said in a statement on Monday. All companies will be allowed to set their own prices for the generic drug and will pay Gilead a royalty on their sales, it said. “We need to have enough companies to have a competitive marketplace,” Gregg Alton, Gilead’s executive vice president, corporate and medical affairs, told a news conference in the Indian capital. Sovaldi is already on track to be one of the world’s biggest-selling drugs, with sales in 2014 - its first full year on the market - set to exceed $11 billion, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis. Campaigners, however, were critical of the licensing deals, saying they would not ensure access to several middle-income countries where health authorities would still struggle to provide treatment to patients. “There are no plans to expand the list (of 91 countries) right now,” Alton said, noting that the drug would be sold at a price higher than $300 for a month’s supply in better-off developing countries, such as China and Brazil. Critics also argue that many poor countries do not have patent protection for Sovaldi, so the medicine could be sold in these places without the agreement of Gilead, at a lower price. “There are no patents on sofosbuvir in India and several other countries that these generic companies could have sold to,” said Tahir Amin, director of intellectual property at I-MAK.org, a group of lawyers and scientists that has opposed a patent on Sovaldi in India. Bhavesh Shah, vice-president of international marketing at Hetero Drugs, said Gilead’s price would serve as the “benchmark” for the Sovaldi generic. The launch of the generic version is expected by the second or third quarter of 2015. The World Health Organization said this year that it wanted a “concerted effort” to drive down the cost of new hepatitis C drugs that offer a cure, but are unaffordable for most infected people worldwide, adding to pressure on Gilead to do more to improve access to Sovaldi. In Egypt, Gilead offered in March to supply the medicine at a 99 percent discount to the U.S. price. The north Arfican country has the world’s highest prevalence of hepatitis C. The new licensing pact will also cover Gilead’s next-generation version of Sovaldi, which would combine sofosbuvir with the experimental therapy ledipasvir. U.S. regulators are due to decide by Oct. 10 whether to approve this new combination.

The mid-stage study evaluated the drug, simtuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy, against a placebo plus chemotherapy, in previously untreated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The study failed its main goal of improving progression-free-survival (PFS). There was no statistically significant difference in PFS between patients on simtuzumab and those on the placebo, Gilead said on Wednesday. Simtuzumab is also being tested for use in colorectal cancer, myelofibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and liver fibrosis.

215,GILD,Gilead's HIV drug shows potential in two mid-stage studies,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc said its HIV tablet containing tenofovir alafenamide was found better than its approved drug, Stribild, in two mid-stage studies. The company’s shares rose 1.3 percent to $106.77 in early trading on the Nasdaq on Wednesday.  In one study, 93 percent of patients taking the drug containing tenofovir alafenamide experienced a reduction in HIV virus in their blood, compared with 92 percent of those taking Stribild.  In the second study, 91.6 percent of patients taking the tenofovir alafenamide drug had reduced HIV virus levels in their blood, compared with 88 percent of those taking Stribild. RBC Capital Markets analysts said the data was positive as it increased confidence in Gilead’s long-term revenue potential from its HIV drug pipeline, beyond 2018.  Gilead’s revenue from HIV drugs is expected to peak at $11.7 billion in 2018, Morningstar analysts said in a note earlier this month. They said there was a 70 percent probability that the drug containing tenofovir alafenamide would be approved. Gilead said on Wednesday it planned to apply for U.S. and European regulatory approval for the drug in the fourth quarter. Separately, the company said it had applied for approval for its hepatitis C treatment in Japan.

217,GILD,France uses tax to put pressure on hepatitis C drug prices,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will tax drugmakers whose costly hepatitis C drugs threaten to throw off course its healthcare budget, the government has said, heaping pressure on pharmaceutical companies like Gilead Sciences to cut their prices. The Socialist government said it had designed a “progressive contribution scheme” ensuring all patients can access new and more effective treatments against the liver-destroying virus, while limiting the burden of these drugs on state finances. The government will selectively tax drugmakers when the total cost to the state from their hepatitis C drugs exceeds a certain amount each year, Health Minister Marisol Touraine said, as she unveiled the country’s 2015 social security budget bill on Monday. If social security spending on hepatitis C drugs exceeds 450 million euros ($567 million) in 2014, the makers of those drugs will be taxed based on the revenue they had reaped in excess of that cap, the ministry said in a presentation.  In 2015, the tax will apply beyond a 700 million euro cap, it added. Details of the new tax should be presented to lawmakers in October and a vote on the budget is due by the end of the year. Some 200,000 people in France are infected with hepatitis C and treatments for the virus could cost the state-run healthcare system as much as 1 billion euros this year, according to reports in newspapers Le Monde and Les Echos.  The ministry declined to comment on any estimates. With its move, France is raising pressure on U.S. biotechnology company Gilead, which obtained regulatory approval for its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi in Europe last January, but is still negotiating its official price in France with representatives of the economy and health ministries.  A representative for Gilead in Europe could not immediately be reached for comment. Gilead has argued that Sovaldi’s price is comparable to older medicines that require longer treatment duration with much lower cure rates and nasty side effects. Sovaldi cures well in excess of 90 percent of patients in as little as eight weeks of treatment. But its price has fueled sharp criticism from governments and private insurers alike. Sovaldi currently costs around 56,000 euros ($70,000) in France and $84,000 in the United States for 12 weeks of treatment. The U.S. price works out to as much as $1,000 per pill. Sovaldi is on track to be one of the world’s biggest-selling drugs, set to rake in close to $12 billion in revenue in 2014 - its first full year on the market - according to forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis.  Rivals Merck & Co and AbbVie are also racing to develop next-generation hepatitis C treatments that cure most people of the virus in a shorter timeframe. Hepatitis C virus, or HCV, is spread through blood, often via contaminated needles, and causes cirrhosis and liver cancer.

219,GILD,"U.S. FDA approves Gilead's $94,500 hepatitis C drug","(Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Friday approved a new hepatitis C pill from Gilead Sciences Inc, which said it will charge $94,500 for an improved 12-week course of treatment to rid patients of the liver-destroying viral infection. The daily pill, to be sold under the brand name Harvoni, combines Gilead’s $84,000 pill Sovaldi with another drug, ledipasvir, and eliminates the need for two older, side-effect-laden treatments that needed to be taken along with Sovaldi. Gilead, which has faced a backlash from health insurers over the high cost of its hepatitis C treatments, said the current regimen of Sovaldi plus the older drugs, interferon and ribavirin, has a cost of $94,726. The company emphasized that the price of the new drug is less than the current regimen, but insurers and other payers said it is still unsustainable. “Unfortunately, we believe that the price being demanded is still inappropriately high for a product targeting such a large group of patients,” said David Whitrap, spokesman for Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest manager of pharmacy benefit programs in the United States. “New innovations do not always require inappropriate, premium pricing.” Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure. Gilead said nearly half of patients infected with the most common type of hepatitis C - previously untreated, healthier individuals - can be cured after eight weeks of taking Harvoni, compared with 12 weeks for the current Sovaldi regimen. The cost of treating those patients with the new pill for eight weeks is $63,000. Wall Street analysts note that the price of Harvoni is lower than the $130,000 or more now needed to treat certain hepatitis C patients with Sovaldi and Olysio, a newer antiviral drug sold by Johnson & Johnson. “The price of $94,000 is very attractive,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. “At eight weeks of therapy, the cost is about $63,000, which is 30 percent cheaper than Sovaldi.” Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas said Harvoni’s pricing came in slightly below her expectations, but is “rational and strongly supportive of sustained market share.” Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said on Tuesday it is no longer seeking U.S. approval for an oral two-drug combination to treat hepatitis C because of competition from rival drugs. AbbVie Inc is slated to hear from the FDA later this year on its application to market an all-oral hepatitis C regimen. “As the additional hepatitis C drugs are approved over the next few months, we’re looking forward to driving more competition in this space,” Express Scripts said.

226,GILD,"After hepatitis C cure, companies target next big liver disease market","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Now that new medicines promise to cure millions of hepatitis C patients in coming years, drugmakers including Gilead Sciences Inc are turning their attention to other liver diseases, with a potential market that could rival the success of statins, which generated more than $30 billion a year in sales at their peak. Several companies are working on treatments for hepatitis B, which can be controlled but not yet cured, and for fatty liver conditions caused by rising obesity, which without treatment could affect half of all Americans by 2030, according to the American Liver Foundation (ALF). Some of the drugs will address advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, which are the scarring that virtually all liver diseases cause without effective treatments. Each of these drugs, once approved, could reach annual sales of as much as $10 billion, industry analysts said.     Most of the treatments are now in early Phase I or Phase II clinical trials, with more informative interim data on several expected over the course of the next year. Gilead, which was first to market with its hepatitis C cure Sovaldi late last year and has been racking up about $3 billion in sales each quarter, is a solid bet to be among the leaders in the next wave of liver therapies, experts said. “The Gilead program is encouraging,” said Dr. Naga Chalasani, director of gastroenterology and hepatology at Indiana University Hospital in Indianapolis, who is participating in clinical trials of promising drugs from Gilead and others. Drugmakers are working to address the fatty liver disease known as NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Without treatment, NASH can progress to liver-destroying cirrhosis and potentially cancer. ALF estimates that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, including NASH, affects up to 30 percent of people in the United States. It can be caused by bad diets and alcohol abuse, and has also been tied to diabetes. “We have no treatment for that condition other than tell a patient they need to lose weight,” said Dr. Mauricio Lisker-Melman, director of the hepatology program at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis.      Intercept Pharmaceuticals has attracted the most attention. Just released final data from a mid-stage clinical trial showed its obeticholic acid halted NASH progression and improved liver scarring in primarily moderately ill patients. “For now, no one else has demonstrated an antifibrotic effect in this population, and I believe we are ahead of the pack in that sense,” said Intercept Chief Executive Mark Pruzanski. Intercept plans to begin a Phase III trial with at least 1,000 more seriously ill patients next year. Dr. Scott Friedman, dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, who has worked with virtually all the companies in the field, said most were first testing drugs in patients whose liver damage is not advanced. “Gilead has sort of leapfrogged that,” Friedman said, tackling more serious damage, as its simtuzumab targets fibrotic scarring directly, rather than inflammation or other drivers of disease. Reversing cirrhosis and improving liver function is “the highest bar I can think of in this business, and it would be spectacular,” he said.     Gilead faces competition from several smaller companies with promising drugs in development, including Intercept, France’s Genfit, Israel’s Galmed, Galectin Therapeutics, Conatus Pharmaceuticals and Raptor Pharmaceuticals, specialists said.     Gilead’s antibody simtuzumab blocks an enzyme called LOXL2 that is directly involved in laying down bands of collagen that form the scar tissue behind cirrhosis. The collagen bands, which result from a wide variety of assaults on the liver, including alcohol and drug abuse, cross link haphazardly to destroy the liver’s architecture and function. Gilead expects to have a strong indication of whether its drug is working when one-year data from a two-year Phase II study becomes available next year. “We have a very active research program,” said Mani Subramanian, head of liver disease clinical research at Gilead. “We’re targeting everything: metabolic issues, inflammation and fibrosis directly.” He acknowledged challenges faced by drugmakers trying to address more advanced liver disease: “It’s been a graveyard for drugs that try to reverse fibrosis,” Subramanian said.     Chalasani at Indiana University Hospital estimated there may be 20 different drugs being tried by various drug companies that seem to be good targets. But betting on them is not for the faint of heart. Intercept’s shares shot from about $72 to over $400 in a matter of days in January after it was announced the trial of its drug would meet the intended goal. On the flip side, Galectin lost nearly two thirds of its value in July, when its NASH drug using a different approach had a setback in a Phase I trial.     Conatus is first testing its drug, emricasan, in patients facing acute liver failure, which has a 50 percent mortality rate in 28 days. Chief Executive Steven Mento said the goal was to “rescue these patients and prevent catastrophic organ failure.” The company plans to work its way back, testing on less severely ill patients. The drug targets inflammation and excessive cell death seen as drivers of the disease.     Dr. David Bernstein, chief of hepatology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., called the Conatus drug exciting and the initial trial a sensible approach.     “There’s limited downside because there’s nothing else that can be done anyway,” said Bernstein, who expects to be involved in future emricasan trials. “If you can reverse cirrhosis, you really will change the impact of liver disease worldwide.” Drugs that succeed in reversing cirrhosis “can be as big a class as the class of statins,” said Conatus’s Mento, referring to cholesterol drugs, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, which alone at its peak had annual sales of about $13 billion.     Raptor, by contrast, is developing a drug for NASH in children, a growing problem that has left liver specialists fearing an obese generation that could require liver transplants in the prime of life.     Raptor is testing a drug already approved for use in children for an extremely rare kidney disease. “In terms of safety, it’s well established,” said Raptor President and CEO designate Julie Anne Smith. It is now engaged in a year-long mid-stage trial of 169 children whose NASH was confirmed by liver biopsy with data expected in the first half of next year.     Companies are waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to outline what it will take to approve a NASH drug. “The FDA is struggling with what constitutes a meaningful improvement with a patient,” Gilead’s Subramanian said. Goals such as reducing fat buildup or modestly improving fibrosis would likely be simpler and quicker to achieve, for example, than avoiding need for liver transplants.      The FDA is working “to identify clinically meaningful endpoints for NASH and related liver diseases to help guide drug development,” it said in a statement. The uncertainty from the FDA also creates risks for investors and has led some analysts to focus on other liver therapies. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee favors companies taking on hepatitis B, such as Arrowhead Research Corp, Canada’s Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, Gilead and Isis Pharmaceuticals in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline.

227,GILD,"INSIGHT-After hep C cure, companies target next big liver disease market","NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Now that new medicines promise to cure millions of hepatitis C patients in coming years, drugmakers including Gilead Sciences Inc are turning their attention to other liver diseases, with a potential market that could rival the success of statins, which generated more than $30 billion a year in sales at their peak. Several companies are working on treatments for hepatitis B, which can be controlled but not yet cured, and for fatty liver conditions caused by rising obesity, which without treatment could affect half of all Americans by 2030, according to the American Liver Foundation (ALF). Some of the drugs will address advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, which are the scarring that virtually all liver diseases cause without effective treatments. Each of these drugs, once approved, could reach annual sales of as much as $10 billion, industry analysts said. Most of the treatments are now in early Phase I or Phase II clinical trials, with more informative interim data on several expected over the course of the next year. Gilead, which was first to market with its hepatitis C cure Sovaldi late last year and has been racking up about $3 billion in sales each quarter, is a solid bet to be among the leaders in the next wave of liver therapies, experts said. “The Gilead program is encouraging,” said Dr. Naga Chalasani, director of gastroenterology and hepatology at Indiana University Hospital in Indianapolis, who is participating in clinical trials of promising drugs from Gilead and others. Drugmakers are working to address the fatty liver disease known as NASH, or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Without treatment, NASH can progress to liver-destroying cirrhosis and potentially cancer. ALF estimates that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, including NASH, affects up to 30 percent of people in the United States. It can be caused by bad diets and alcohol abuse, and has also been tied to diabetes. “We have no treatment for that condition other than tell a patient they need to lose weight,” said Dr. Mauricio Lisker-Melman, director of the hepatology program at Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis. Intercept Pharmaceuticals has attracted the most attention. Just released final data from a mid-stage clinical trial showed its obeticholic acid halted NASH progression and improved liver scarring in primarily moderately ill patients. “For now, no one else has demonstrated an antifibrotic effect in this population, and I believe we are ahead of the pack in that sense,” said Intercept Chief Executive Mark Pruzanski. Intercept plans to begin a Phase III trial with at least 1,000 more seriously ill patients next year. Dr. Scott Friedman, dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, who has worked with virtually all the companies in the field, said most were first testing drugs in patients whose liver damage is not advanced. “Gilead has sort of leapfrogged that,” Friedman said, tackling more serious damage, as its simtuzumab targets fibrotic scarring directly, rather than inflammation or other drivers of disease. Reversing cirrhosis and improving liver function is “the highest bar I can think of in this business, and it would be spectacular,” he said. Gilead faces competition from several smaller companies with promising drugs in development, including Intercept, France’s Genfit, Israel’s Galmed, Galectin Therapeutics, Conatus Pharmaceuticals and Raptor Pharmaceuticals, specialists said. Gilead’s antibody simtuzumab blocks an enzyme called LOXL2 that is directly involved in laying down bands of collagen that form the scar tissue behind cirrhosis. The collagen bands, which result from a wide variety of assaults on the liver, including alcohol and drug abuse, cross link haphazardly to destroy the liver’s architecture and function. Gilead expects to have a strong indication of whether its drug is working when one-year data from a two-year Phase II study becomes available next year. “We have a very active research program,” said Mani Subramanian, head of liver disease clinical research at Gilead. “We’re targeting everything: metabolic issues, inflammation and fibrosis directly.” He acknowledged challenges faced by drugmakers trying to address more advanced liver disease: “It’s been a graveyard for drugs that try to reverse fibrosis,” Subramanian said. Chalasani at Indiana University Hospital estimated there may be 20 different drugs being tried by various drug companies that seem to be good targets. But betting on them is not for the faint of heart. Intercept’s shares shot from about $72 to over $400 in a matter of days in January after it was announced the trial of its drug would meet the intended goal. On the flip side, Galectin lost nearly two thirds of its value in July, when its NASH drug using a different approach had a setback in a Phase I trial. Conatus is first testing its drug, emricasan, in patients facing acute liver failure, which has a 50 percent mortality rate in 28 days. Chief Executive Steven Mento said the goal was to “rescue these patients and prevent catastrophic organ failure.” The company plans to work its way back, testing on less severely ill patients. The drug targets inflammation and excessive cell death seen as drivers of the disease. Dr. David Bernstein, chief of hepatology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., called the Conatus drug exciting and the initial trial a sensible approach. “There’s limited downside because there’s nothing else that can be done anyway,” said Bernstein, who expects to be involved in future emricasan trials. “If you can reverse cirrhosis, you really will change the impact of liver disease worldwide.” Drugs that succeed in reversing cirrhosis “can be as big a class as the class of statins,” said Conatus’s Mento, referring to cholesterol drugs, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, which alone at its peak had annual sales of about $13 billion. Raptor, by contrast, is developing a drug for NASH in children, a growing problem that has left liver specialists fearing an obese generation that could require liver transplants in the prime of life. Raptor is testing a drug already approved for use in children for an extremely rare kidney disease. “In terms of safety, it’s well established,” said Raptor President and CEO designate Julie Anne Smith. It is now engaged in a year-long mid-stage trial of 169 children whose NASH was confirmed by liver biopsy with data expected in the first half of next year. Companies are waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to outline what it will take to approve a NASH drug. “The FDA is struggling with what constitutes a meaningful improvement with a patient,” Gilead’s Subramanian said. Goals such as reducing fat buildup or modestly improving fibrosis would likely be simpler and quicker to achieve, for example, than avoiding need for liver transplants. The FDA is working “to identify clinically meaningful endpoints for NASH and related liver diseases to help guide drug development,” it said in a statement. The uncertainty from the FDA also creates risks for investors and has led some analysts to focus on other liver therapies. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee favors companies taking on hepatitis B, such as Arrowhead Research Corp , Canada’s Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, Gilead and Isis Pharmaceuticals in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline.

Chief Executive Steven Mento said the goal was to “rescue these patients and prevent catastrophic organ failure.” The company plans to work its way back, testing on less severely ill patients. The drug targets inflammation and excessive cell death seen as drivers of the disease. Dr. David Bernstein, chief of hepatology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., called the Conatus drug exciting and the initial trial a sensible approach. “There’s limited downside because there’s nothing else that can be done anyway,” said Bernstein, who expects to be involved in future emricasan trials. “If you can reverse cirrhosis, you really will change the impact of liver disease worldwide.” Drugs that succeed in reversing cirrhosis “can be as big a class as the class of statins,” said Conatus’s Mento, referring to cholesterol drugs, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, which alone at its peak had annual sales of about $13 billion. Raptor, by contrast, is developing a drug for NASH in children, a growing problem that has left liver specialists fearing an obese generation that could require liver transplants in the prime of life. Raptor is testing a drug already approved for use in children for an extremely rare kidney disease. “In terms of safety, it’s well established,” said Raptor President and CEO designate Julie Anne Smith. It is now engaged in a year-long mid-stage trial of 169 children whose NASH was confirmed by liver biopsy with data expected in the first half of next year. Companies are waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to outline what it will take to approve a NASH drug. “The FDA is struggling with what constitutes a meaningful improvement with a patient,” Gilead’s Subramanian said. Goals such as reducing fat buildup or modestly improving fibrosis would likely be simpler and quicker to achieve, for example, than avoiding need for liver transplants. The FDA is working “to identify clinically meaningful endpoints for NASH and related liver diseases to help guide drug development,” it said in a statement. The uncertainty from the FDA also creates risks for investors and has led some analysts to focus on other liver therapies. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee favors companies taking on hepatitis B, such as Arrowhead Research Corp , Canada’s Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, Gilead and Isis Pharmaceuticals in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline. And one private company not to be ignored, OnCore Biopharma, founded by former Pharmasset executives, including the inventor of Gilead’s Sovaldi. While finding a cure for hepatitis B will not be easy, trials would mirror those for hepatitis C, with a simple blood test yielding clear results in months rather than years.

235,GILD,Merck 4-week hep C regimen with Gilead's Sovaldi comes up short,"Nov 9 (Reuters) - An attempt by Merck & Co to shorten hepatitis C treatment to just four weeks by adding Gilead Sciences Inc’s huge selling Sovaldi to its own oral two-drug combination came nowhere near the desired efficacy due to a high rate of relapses, according to interim data from a midstage study. Several companies have been working to find ways to further reduce the number of weeks of treatment needed, while keeping cure rates above 90 percent. A just approved pill called Harvoni that combines Sovaldi  with another Gilead drug requires eight weeks of treatment for many patients, and longer for tougher to treat patients. In the ongoing Merck trial of previously untreated patients, only 38.7 percent had no detectable sign of the liver destroying virus after four weeks of treatment with Sovaldi and Merck’s grazoprevir/elbasvir combination. Nineteen of the 31 patients in the four-week treatment arm relapsed prior to the planned end of the study, which is 12 weeks after completion of dosing. The preliminary data was set to be presented on Monday at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) meeting in Boston. The best result so far in the multi-arm, three-drug study called C-Swift was observed with eight weeks of treatment of patients with cirrhosis in which 94.7 percent had no detectable virus. They will be deemed cured if the virus has not reappeared 12 weeks after stopping treatment. With a six-week regimen in non-cirrhotics, 86.7 percent of patients had no sign of virus up to 8 weeks after completing treatment, according to the interim results. “These findings will inform the design of larger studies aimed at understanding the potential of short-duration triple therapy across multiple patient types,” Dr. Eric Lawitz, the study’s lead investigator, said in a statement. The three drugs each work in a different way to help prevent the virus from replicating. But following failure of the 4-week experiment, Merck said it will turn its attention to studying a combination of three of its own drugs in development rather than involving the Gilead medicine in future studies. The hepatitis C field has been moving at a lightning pace. Only a handful of years ago, patients needed 48 weeks of treatment with drugs that had harsh side effects and only cured about 40 percent of patients. The new all-oral treatments eliminate the need for injectable interferon and its flu-like side effects, as well as another older drug called ribavirin that caused anemia and other problems, while dramatically increasing cure rates and reducing treatment duration.

238,GILD,"France pegs Gilead hepatitis C drug at ""lowest price in Europe""","PARIS, Nov 20 (Reuters) - France has negotiated a big discount for Gilead Sciences Inc’s controversial new hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, under a government deal that ensures it will be fully reimbursable by health-funding schemes. The Economic Committee for Health Products (CEPS) has fixed the price of a box of Sovaldi at 13,667 euros before tax, a reduction of 5,000 euros on the original price and “the lowest price in Europe”, the Health Ministry said on Thursday. Twelve weeks of treatment will now cost 41,000 euros ($51,373) before tax, against 56,000 euros previously. In the United States, where Sovaldi’s high price has sparked controversy and pushed up insurance companies’ costs, a 12-week course costs $84,000, or $1,000 per pill. Some 200,000 people in France have hepatitis C and the total cost of treatment to the national health fund is 800 million euros a year. Sovaldi has racked up record sales despite a fierce debate over its price and concerns that high demand will place a huge burden on government-run health plans and private insurers. Last month, U.S. regulators approved the sale of a new hepatitis C pill from Gilead, called Harvoni, which will cost $94,500 for an improved 12-week course of treatment to rid patients of the liver-destroying viral infection. Harvoni has just won temporary approval for sale in France at 16,000 euros a box but negotiations are taking place with the French government aiming for a lower price.

239,GILD,"Drug spending tops $1 trillion on hepatitis C, cancer therapies: study","(Reuters) - Global pharmaceutical spending will break the trillion dollar mark in 2014, driven by high prices in the United States for novel treatments such as Gilead Sciences Inc’s  Sovaldi for hepatitis C and new cancer drugs, according to a study released on Thursday. Total spending on drugs will hit $1.06 trillion, an increase of 7 percent over 2013 levels, according to the report from the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. The increase also reflected a slowdown in the introduction of cheaper generic versions of branded medicines. By 2018, IMS expects spending to rise to $1.3 trillion due to new breakthrough therapies. Hepatitis C drugs will add about $100 billion in total spending in the next few years, while cancer spending will rise to $100 billion and diabetes care will account for another $78 billion. Cancer drugs contributing to the high cost include Roche Holding AG’s Perjeta and Kadcyla, Pharmacyclics Inc’s Imbruvica and Amgen’s Kyprolis. Drugmakers have come under pressure over high U.S. prices, particularly Sovaldi’s list price of $1,000 per pill. State Medicaid offices and private insurers say the prices are too high to bear, while drugmakers defend them as reflecting the wider cost of developing medicines, many of which they say will never make a profit. U.S. spending accounts for about one-third of the total drug spend and is due to rise 11.7 percent in 2014 before the growth rate slows to an annual 5 percent increase after 2015. IMS’s spending figures do not take into account manufacturer rebates, coupons and discounts, particularly in the United States, which will lower spending by about one half a percentage point during that time period, or $60 billion to $80 billion. In the 2009 to 2013 period, there was an estimated $63 billion in rebates, IMS said. “Within the U.S. market, we are seeing in aggregate higher levels of rebate, especially in the diabetes and respiratory therapy areas,” said Murray Aitken, executive director of the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. Rebates typically increase for drugs that are about to go off patent, then disappear once they are off patent, Aitken said.

241,GILD,UPDATE 1-FDA declines to approve Bristol-Myers hepatitis drug,"(Adds details on drug, other Bristol-Myers, rival treatments) Nov 26 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on Wednesday said U.S. regulators had declined to approve the use of its experimental treatment for hepatitis C, daclatasvir, in combination with other antiviral drugs. Bristol-Myers said it had initially sought permission from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market the drug, a so-called NS5A inhibitor, in combination with asunaprevir, one of the New York-based company’s experimental medicines. But Bristol-Myers abandoned its U.S. marketing application for asunaprevir in October because of potential competition from more potent drugs, leaving the FDA without data to gauge the effectiveness of daclatasvir as part of a combination regimen. Bristol-Myers said the FDA has asked it for data involving use of daclatasvir with other drugs, and that the company is in discussions with the agency about the scope of the required information. Most notably, it is testing daclatasvir in combination with Gilead Sciences Inc’s Sovaldi, a blockbuster treatment that is used on its own or as a component of a combination treatment called Harvoni that was recently introduced by Gilead and is expected to quickly become the market leader. Bristol-Myers’ combination of daclatasvir and asunaprevir,  however, was approved in July for use in Japan, which it long considered a prime market for the treatment. One strain of the hepatitis C virus, Genotype 1b, is prevalent in Japan, where intolerance to interferon, an older medicine, is particularly high. In late-stage clinical trials, the combination treatment cured about 85 percent of patients with 24 weeks of therapy. The combinations being developed by rival drugmakers have demonstrated cure rates well in excess of 90 percent with just 12 weeks of therapy, and they are pursuing even shorter treatment durations. Bristol-Myers, meanwhile, is studying a three-drug regimen that, based on earlier studies, is expected to cure more people in 12 weeks and would compete more favorably with rival treatments. The U.S. marketing application for the company’s three-drug combination is expected to be filed next year. Shares of Bristol-Myers were little changed in afternoon trading on Wednesday.

Some insurers and analysts had said that AbbVie might price its drug, which will be sold under the brand name Viekira Pak,  lower than Gilead because of pricing pressure. Gilead has come under intense pressure from U.S. health insurers, politicians and pharmacy benefit managers over the high cost of Sovaldi and more recently, Harvoni. It argues the price is justified because the treatment cures nearly all patients of the liver-destroying virus. An AbbVie spokeswoman said the company considered many factors in setting the price such as the cost effectiveness of the treatment and its value in offsetting other short and long term costs. The AbbVie regimen consists of four different anti-viral drugs to be taken as three pills in the morning and one in the evening. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the regimen for patients with genotype 1 form of the virus, the most common type of hepatitis C and the most difficult to treat. It was not immediately clear how the AbbVie pricing would impact Harvoni sales, which is widely expected to dominate the market given its advantage of fewer pills. Gilead’s Sovaldi, which was approved a year ago, had been selling at the rate of about $3 billion per quarter due to huge pent up demand. The AbbVie regimen has demonstrated similar efficacy to Gilead’s, with cure rates of 95 to 100 percent, the company said, and minimal negative side effects. AbbVie said that 95 percent of patients will require a 12 week treatment. Enanta Pharmaceuticals Inc, which helped develop the Abbvie drug, saw its shares rise 4.2 percent in after-hours trading while AbbVie’s shares gained 1.1 percent.

250,GILD,Express Scripts drops Gilead hep C drugs for cheaper AbbVie rival,"(Reuters) - The largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager said on Monday it has lined up a cheaper price for AbbVie Inc’s newly approved hepatitis C treatment and, in most cases, will no longer cover Gilead Sciences Inc’s treatments after trying for nearly a year to win a deeper discount. Express Scripts’ move reignited investor concerns that pharmaceutical companies will have to bow to pricing pressure from U.S. insurers and lawmakers over novel medications whose cost can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for some diseases. Gilead shares dropped 13 percent, or about $14.54, in Monday trading to $93.88, though it was still far above the $65 level reached in April, when insurers launched a major outcry over its multibillion-dollar hepatitis C business. Shares in major biotechnology companies such as Amgen, Biogen and Celgene fell more than 2 percent. Express Scripts opposed the $84,000 price tag of Gilead Sciences’ Sovaldi treatment since its approval a year ago. It said the $1,000-a-day pill, shown to cure hepatitis C in most patients, was unaffordable. Private insurers generally receive discounts of as much as 20 percent, but Gilead has resisted, bringing in $3 billion in quarterly revenue for Sovaldi this year. The company maintains that Sovaldi, and a next-generation version called Harvoni that was approved in October, will save the U.S. healthcare system the costs of caring for advanced liver disease in many patients. Gilead spokeswoman Cara Miller said on Monday in an e-mailed statement that the company is continuing to negotiate with Express Scripts. AbbVie’s Viekira Pak drug was approved on Friday by U.S. regulators and the company set a list price of $83,319.  But it has agreed to a significantly lower price than Gilead for Express Scripts’ National Preferred Formulary, a list of approved and covered drugs for 25 million Americans, Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview. “This is unprecedented,” Miller said, explaining that the pricing on specialty drugs of this type tend to be much closer even when a competitor enters the market. He did not provide a specific dollar figure, but said AbbVie had narrowed the price gap to resemble what Western European countries pay for  Sovaldi, which runs from $51,373 in France to $66,000 in Germany. An estimated 3.2 million people in the United States have hepatitis C. Most insurance plans have paid for Gilead’s drugs only for patients with advanced liver disease to limit their exposure to its cost. Express Scripts said the AbbVie agreement will allow it to extend treatment to all hepatitis C patients.  Dr. Camilla Graham, co-director of the viral hepatitis center at Beth Israel Deaconess medical center in Boston, said she is hopeful other insurers will follow suit.  “My first thought when I saw this was ‘Finally, we have a solution to this public health crisis,’” Graham said. A significant portion of patients with hepatitis C receive medical care through government-paid programs, including Medicare for the elderly and disabled, Medicaid for the poor and the U.S. Department of Defense. State Medicaid agencies have also limited access to Gilead’s Sovaldi, saying it is too expensive even after they receive a legally mandated 23 percent discount. Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said he is “hopeful but cautious” about the state agencies’ ability to extract further rebates on top of the discount from Gilead and AbbVie. America’s Health Insurance Plans, the insurance industry’s largest lobbying group, also hopes to see Gilead’s prices drop now that there is competition in the market, said spokesman Brendan Buck.  The AbbVie regimen consists of a cocktail of anti-viral drugs to be taken as three pills in the morning and one in the evening. The regimen requires some patients also to take ribavirin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the regimen for patients with genotype 1 form of the virus, the most common type of hepatitis C and the most difficult to treat. Express Scripts said starting Jan. 1, 2015, it would pay for the AbbVie drug only for patients who have genotype 1. Express Scripts will no longer cover Gilead’s Harvoni, a one-pill treatment for patients with genotype 1 that costs $94,500 for a 12-week course. It will cover Sovaldi in cases where patients have other types of the disease.  The AbbVie regimen is also not recommended for patients whose livers are not functioning and in people who have not benefited from using older treatments. An Express Scripts spokesman said the company will make exceptions for those patients to allow them to take Gilead’s medications. Mario Molina, chief executive officer of Molina Healthcare Inc., a small Medicaid insurer in California that has criticized Gilead’s high prices, said on Monday that he sees more competition on drug prices ahead. “I think that this is the beginning,” Molina said, describing the move as “a harbinger of things to come.” ",12222014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-express-scripts-abbvie-hepatitisc/express-scripts-drops-gilead-hep-c-drugs-for-cheaper-abbvie-rival-idUSKBN0K007620141222

The S&P; 500 ended at a record, though trading was quiet with many market participants out ahead of the upcoming Christmas holiday. About 6 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, compared with the month-to-date average of 7.86 billion. Tech was the strongest sector of the day, with the S&P; information technology sector up 1.1 percent. Intel Corp rose 2.3 percent to $37.21, providing the biggest boost to the Dow, while IBM rose 1.8 percent to $161.44 and Cisco Systems rose 1.6 percent to $28.22. Priceline Group rose 3.6 percent to $1,149.38. “I wouldn’t put a lot of weight on this week’s trading, given year-end maneuvers and how slow it is,” said Rex Macey, chief allocation officer at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors in Atlanta, Georgia. “While I’m comfortable with the level of the broader market, I don’t think there are obvious bargains. Some may say oil stocks are bargains now, but it’s too soon to say.” Crude oil sank 3.2 percent after Saudi Arabia’s powerful oil minister said OPEC would not cut production at any price. The S&P; energy index fell 1 percent as one of the day’s weakest sectors; Chesapeake Energy  fell 7.3 percent to $18.42 while Southwestern Energy  was off 5.5 percent at $29.31. Crude oil is coming off four straight weeks of declines, and has fallen in 11 of the past 12 completed weeks. The S&P; rose 3.4 percent last week, boosted by a 5 percent jump over three sessions, after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would take a “patient” approach toward raising interest rates and oil prices appeared to stabilize. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 154.57 points, or 0.87 percent, to 17,959.37, the S&P; 500 gained 7.89 points, or 0.38 percent, to 2,078.54 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 16.04 points, or 0.34 percent, to 4,781.42.

259,GILD,Achillion data shows promise of shorter-duration hep C treatment,"(Reuters) - Data from Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc’s hepatitis C drug trials showed the company could develop a shorter-duration treatment rivaling offerings from Gilead Sciences Inc and Abbvie Inc. The company said on Monday it would test a combination of two of its experimental hepatitis C drugs after they showed promise against the virus in separate studies. The biotechnology company’s shares rose as much as 17 percent to $16.77, their highest in more than seven years. Data from the first study, testing a combination of Achillion’s NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, and Gilead’s blockbuster Sovaldi, showed signs that the virus disappeared within four weeks, following a six-week course of therapy.  Gilead’s Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi with the company’s own NS5A inhibitor, achieves this response only after eight weeks of therapy. The main goal of Achillion’s ongoing mid-stage study is to achieve a sustained virological response 12 weeks after therapy that would constitute a cure. The market for hepatitis C drugs has developed at a lightening pace in recent years, with several companies working on producing newer drugs to treat the disease that affects about 150 million around the world. The U.S. health regulator on Friday approved Abbvie’s hep C cocktail.  In a separate early-stage study, Achillion’s nucleotide inhibitor, ACH-3422, also demonstrated potent antiviral activity. William Blair’s Katherine Xu said the company’s ACH-3422 was slower to exert its effects than Sovaldi, adding that its nucleotide inhibitor needs to be equally effective for Achillion to attract takeover interest. Achillion, one of the few companies developing hepatitis C drugs independently, said it planned to start mid-stage studies to evaluate the combination next year. Wells Fargo’s Brian Abrahams said an all-Achillion combination could still have an edge over competition as ACH-3102’s high barrier to resistance will offset ACH-3422’s slower effect.

261,GILD,Express Scripts presses for more drug savings with coverage list,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Express Scripts, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U.S. employers, is taking an increasingly aggressive stance in price negotiations with pharmaceutical companies after winning discounts on medications with a strategy introduced last year. On Monday, Express Scripts said it lined up a cheaper price for AbbVie Inc’s newly approved hepatitis C treatment and, in most cases, will no longer cover Gilead Sciences Inc’s   rival treatments after trying for nearly a year to win a deeper discount. [ID: nL1N0U61N4] The move threatens to undermine profits at Gilead, and was viewed by Wall Street as a sign that other major biotechnology players, including Amgen Inc and Biogen Inc, will face steeper U.S. pricing pressure from insurers. Other drugmakers without potentially transformative new products, such as Shire Plc, Novo Nordisk and Theravance Inc , may also be particularly vulnerable, analysts said. Neither Shire, Novo Nordisk nor Theravance responded to requests for comment. Express Scripts will further expand the number of medicines it won’t cover for 2016, including treatments for common illnesses such as diabetes, pulmonary hypertension and arthritis, said Chief Medical Officer Dr Steve Miller, in an interview earlier this month. In some cases, Express Scripts could drop coverage for newer specialty medicines in the biotechnology field, he said. The timing on specific drugs will depend on when new competing drugs with similar clinical benefits are approved for the U.S. market. Express Scripts first began excluding drugs from its largest national reimbursement list for 2014, with 44 medications, and increased that number to 66 for 2015. The prospect of having their drugs dropped from Express Scripts’ biggest “formulary” list of covered medicines has prompted some leading pharmaceutical makers to discount their prices, Miller said. Express Scripts is acting on behalf of clients who need to rein in healthcare costs, and estimates that the move has so far saved such employers more than $1 billion in annual spending, Miller said. Employers “are by necessity asking us to take a more aggressive stance because the affordability of their benefits is really at risk,” Miller said. “We are going to be opportunistic” in looking for savings in the future. Gilead shares dropped more than 14 percent in Monday trading to $92.90. Shares in Amgen, Biogen and Celgene CELG.O fell more than 2 percent. The second largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager, CVS Health Corp, has said it will exclude 95 prescription products from its reimbursement list next year, up from 72 in 2014. It expects the practice will save its plan sponsors over $3.5 billion between 2012 and 2015. The drugs most under scrutiny include more expensive, “me-too” products, in categories where several drugmakers compete for similar patients. Both Novo Nordisk and Sanofi SA  are developing slightly longer-lasting insulins. Amgen, AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson, respectively sell Enbrel, Humira and Remicade - all rheumatoid arthritis drugs that work in a similar way. Companies like Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries and Actavis want to switch patients to more expensive versions of their multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s drugs, respectively, before the arrival of cheap generic competitors. The effect is already being felt by such Big Pharma players as AstraZeneca Plc and Sanofi. Both companies warned recently that the need to offer U.S. price discounts on some of their biggest brand-name medicines will hurt 2015 sales. Insurers are pushing back against prices in other categories, including blood thinners and even HIV drugs and multiple sclerosis treatments, where there are multiple options for doctors and patients, observers said. “The extent of this becoming a broader problem is tied to whether we get great new drugs for things like asthma, (high cholesterol), Alzheimer’s and cancer,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal. “If there is a limited pool of money and a bunch of new drugs, the pressure on older drugs will increase.” In recent years, the introduction of far cheaper generic versions of medicines like Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor to reduce cholesterol and Merck & Co’s asthma drug Singulair helped insurers save on reimbursement costs. But that wave of patent expiries has slowed considerably. In the meantime, a new crop of novel, and in some cases, highly effective treatments for cancer and hepatitis C are costing them tens of billions of dollars more to reimburse. The influx of generics “allowed the system to actually see drug price deflation,” said Asher Anolic, manager of Fidelity’s Select Pharmaceuticals Portfolio. “At the same time, others are launching innovative new drugs ... Based on those dynamics I get more concerned. Where is the give in the system? It’s on the legacy products.” Anolic said his Fidelity fund focuses on drugmakers with highly differentiated portfolios of treatments. Its top holdings as of Sept 30 included Actavis, AbbVie, Novartis AG  and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. “When you look at the industry as a whole, we will probably see less profitability,” said Nils Behnke, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Co. “Mid-sized companies with a broader portfolio of little products, ‘me-too’ products - they will have a hard time.” Murray Aitken, vice president at healthcare information company IMS Health, estimates that 2014 spending on new and innovative brand-name drugs will total about $20 billion compared with about $3 billion in 2012. Industry executives say newer health plans, whether purchased by individual consumers or offered through an employer, will further accelerate efforts to limit drug prices because they require patients to pay a higher share of prescription costs. Pharmacy benefits companies like Express Scripts say they will cover an excluded medicine if that specific treatment is deemed medically necessary for a patient. Some groups have expressed concern that patient care might be compromised. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a leading drug industry trade group, said such practices hurt patients by limiting access to a range of appropriate medicines and potentially discriminating against certain conditions. But insurers say that the high price of new drugs set by manufacturers has already deterred some patients from following doctor’s orders. “Plan sponsors, because of the rapid rise in cost, are many times having to ask the consumer to pay more” for their medicines, said Express Scripts’ Miller. “If you can’t afford your healthcare, you don’t take it.” ",12232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-usa-expressscripts/express-scripts-presses-for-more-drug-savings-with-coverage-list-idUSL1N0U70ML20141223

267,GILD,CVS to cover Gilead hepatitis C treatment over AbbVie regimen,"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp, one of the largest U.S. managers of drug benefits, said it would give preferred status to the hepatitis C treatments from Gilead Sciences and cover a new competing treatment from AbbVie Inc only as an exception. The latest salvo in the battle to grab market share for new all-oral treatments for the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus follows a move last month by CVS rival Express Scripts Holding that favored AbbVie’s regimen after negotiating a price discount below what Gilead had been charging its commercial customers. Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, said it would cover AbbVie’s Viekira Pak and exclude Gilead’s Sovaldi and combination drug Harvoni. The decision had sent Gilead shares sharply lower at the time. On Monday, Gilead shares were up 2.5 percent following the CVS announcement, while AbbVie shares were down 2.2 percent. Gilead has come under intense criticism for the high price of its first-to-market all-oral treatment; Sovaldi costs about $1,000 per pill. Harvoni combines Sovaldi with another drug into a one-pill, once-a-day treatment with cure rates well above 90 percent.

268,GILD,UPDATE 1-CVS to cover Gilead hepatitis C treatment over AbbVie regimen,"(Recasts with attribution from CVS; adds Express Scripts, analyst comment, background) By Bill Berkrot and Caroline Humer Jan 5 (Reuters) - CVS Health Corp, one of the largest U.S. managers of drug benefits, said it would give preferred status to the hepatitis C treatments from Gilead Sciences and cover a new competing treatment from AbbVie Inc only as an exception. The latest salvo in the battle to grab market share for new all-oral treatments for the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus follows a move last month by CVS rival Express Scripts Holding  that favored AbbVie’s regimen after negotiating a price discount below what Gilead had been charging its commercial customers. Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, said it would cover AbbVie’s Viekira Pak and exclude Gilead’s Sovaldi and combination drug Harvoni. The decision had sent Gilead shares sharply lower at the time. On Monday, Gilead shares were up 2.5 percent following the CVS announcement, while AbbVie shares were down 2.2 percent. Gilead has come under intense criticism for the high price of its first-to-market all-oral treatment; Sovaldi costs about $1,000 per pill. Harvoni combines Sovaldi with another drug into a one-pill, once-a-day treatment with cure rates well above 90 percent. A 12-week course of treatment with Harvoni costs about $93,500, although some patients may need just eights weeks of therapy costing about $63,000.

269,GILD,UPDATE 1-Anthem selects Gilead as primary supplier of hepatitis C drugs,"(Adds details, background, share price) By Deena Beasley Jan 8 (Reuters) - Health insurer Anthem Inc on Thursday said it reached a deal under which Gilead Sciences Inc’s hepatitis C drug Harvoni will be the primary treatment for patients infected with the most common strain of the liver-destroying virus. Anthem said the deal effectively lowers its hepatitis C treatment costs. “We were able to achieve a very competitive rate and a freeze on retail pricing for 2015,” the insurer said in an emailed statement. “That does favorably impact plan costs for 2015.” Gilead has come under fire for the high cost of Harvoni, as well as predecessor drug Sovaldi, which was launched in late 2013 at a price of $1,000 per pill. Harvoni has a list price of $94,500 for 12 weeks of treatment, or $1,125 per daily pill. Last month, AbbVie Inc began sales of a competing drug, Viekira Pak, at a similar list price. Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U.S. employers, subsequently chose AbbVie’s drug as the exclusive option for patients in its largest commercial plan, covering 25 million people. Anthem said Harvoni is covered for members of its affiliated health plans who are infected with genotype 1 hepatitis C, the strain that accounts for around 75 percent of all chronic hepatitis C infections in the United States. The insurer attributed its decision to favorable pricing and clinical differences, including the fact that Harvoni does not require additional medication, and offers a less complex treatment regimen than the AbbVie drug. CVS Health Corp, the nation’s second-largest pharmacy benefit manager, said this week it had selected Gilead’s drugs as its exclusive option for patients on commercial plans as well as those covered under its healthcare exchange plans, Medicare and Medicaid. Anthem declined to comment on the number of customers affected by its deal with Gilead but said it affects patients covered under its commercial/employer-based plan. Anthem said hepatitis C drugs sit on the highest coverage tiers, which means patients are required to pay for a certain percentage of the drug cost. Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas said Anthem is a client of Express Scripts, covering between 8.5 million and 13.5 million patients. “We see the Anthem deal as positive, however note that discounts are now key to play in the HCV space,” Karnauskas said in a research note.

272,GILD,"Gilead, AbbVie hit by fresh concerns on Hep C discounting","(Reuters) - Shares of Gilead Sciences Inc closed down 6 percent on Tuesday, after a pharmacy benefit manager said it would cover both Gilead and rival AbbVie Inc’s hepatitis C offering, renewing concerns of pricing pressure. Investors interpreted this as further discounting of hep C drugs, signaled by an increasing willingness by drugmakers to offer rebates, Sanford Bernstein’s Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note. Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, dropped Gilead’s hep C drugs in December in favor of AbbVie’s newly approved alternative at a cheaper price. Meanwhile, CVS Health Corp, the second-largest pharmacy benefit manager, and health insurer Anthem Inc inked deals with Gilead to cover Harvoni. On Monday, St. Paul, Minnesota-based pharmacy benefit manager Prime Therapeutics LLC, which serves over 25 million people, said it would cover both Gilead’s Harvoni and AbbVie’s Viekira Pak.  “There has been a substantial reduction in the net price of both of these drugs just in the past few weeks, so sometimes it pays not to go first,” said Peter Wickersham, Prime’s senior vice president of Integrated Care and Specialty. While exact rebate rates will unlikely be disclosed we would hesitate to read too much into the claims from Prime, and we do not believe they alter expectations about hep C pricing, Porges said. “It is possible that neither Gilead nor AbbVie felt the need to offer a deep rebate to Prime for exclusivity.” Prime is not known for exclusionary formularies in contrast with CVS and Express Scripts, and consequently, both drugmakers may have been less pressured with Prime than they were with CVS and Express Scripts, he said.  AbbVie’s shares closed down 3.6 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

274,GILD,UPDATE 1-Express Scripts sees opportunity to lower cancer treatment cost,"(Adds Amgen, Regeneron comments) By Susan Kelly and Bill Berkrot Jan 13 (Reuters) - Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, on Tuesday said cost savings on expensive cancer treatments could be achieved if the company were involved earlier in the decision-making process. Express Scripts, which has become more aggressive in negotiating discounts on drugs for insurance plans and employers, in December stopped covering Gilead Sciences Inc’s  hepatitis C treatments after lining up a cheaper price for AbbVie’s newly-approved alternative. Gilead’s Sovaldi and follow-up combination pill Harvoni have been shown to cure hepatitis C in more than 90 percent of patients. But Express deemed the more than $90,000 price for 12 weeks of Harvoni treatment unaffordable. The move reignited investor concerns that drugmakers will have to bow to pricing pressure from U.S. insurers and lawmakers over novel medications whose cost can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for some diseases. For cancer patients, treatment decisions typically go through health insurance plans first, and medicines are not changed once people have begun their regimens, Express Scripts Chief Executive George Paz said at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco. He said PBMs should be included in the decision-making process at a much earlier stage. “The big opportunity out there is really in cancer,” Paz said. “If we can get out in front of that, that is a huge opportunity.” Paz said he is also focused on a new crop of cholesterol-lowering drugs expected to hit the market this year, and is talking to companies about market share, positioning and pricing. “They are pretty astonishing, but they are also very expensive,” Paz said of the drugs which target a protein known as PCSK9. Manufacturers include Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi . The key is to determine which are real breakthrough treatments and which are “me too” drugs, Paz said. Amgen said it was talking to payers about its evolocumab, and believes they can only exclude a drug from formularies if there is no clinical difference between rival medicines. “If not, payers will have to leave choices to physicians,” said Tony Hooper, Amgen’s head of commercial operations. Regeneron Chief Executive Officer Len Schleifer was asked if he was concerned about Paz’s comments that PCSK9 drugs were in his sights. “It’s not a worry. It’s a reality that we will deal with,” Schleifer said. “I think there will be fair pricing and healthy competition in the marketplace.”   (Reporting by Susan Kelly in Chicago and Bill Berkrot in New York; Editing by Christian Plumb, Bernard Orr)",1132015,http://www.reuters.com/article/healthcare-expressscripts-drugprices/update-1-express-scripts-sees-opportunity-to-lower-cancer-treatment-cost-idUSL1N0US1Z120150113
275,GILD,India rejects Gilead's Hepatitis C drug patent request,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s patent office has rejected an application from U.S.-based Gilead Sciences Inc for its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, paving the way for local drugmakers to launch cheaper generic versions of the $1,000-a-pill medicine. The application had been opposed by Indian generic drugmaker Natco Pharma Ltd and New York-based Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK) on the grounds that the drug, chemically called sofosbuvir, is not inventive enough compared with a previous formulation, according to patent office order documents seen by Reuters on Wednesday. India’s patent laws allow a third party to dispute the validity of a pending patent application. The patent office’s order said Gilead’s request for Sovaldi, which is normally given for either three or six months and costs $84,000 for a 12-week course in the United States, was rejected on the basis that “minor changes in the molecule” did not improve efficacy of the drug. The rejection will allow the Indian generic companies to make and sell versions of the drug in country where a majority of people live on less than $2 a day and health insurance is scarce. Gilead could not immediately be reached for comment. Natco Chief Executive Rajeev Nannapaneni was not available outside regular Indian business hours. Foreign drugmakers in India, a global hub for making generic drugs, have been frustrated by a series of decisions on patents and pricing, with the government looking to improve healthcare access. Market access and patent protection for U.S. drugs are expected to feature when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosts President Barack Obama later this month for India’s annual Republic Day celebrations. The patent office’s order comes amid a growing clamor by healthcare campaigners and doctors to ensure Sovaldi and other new hepatitis C pills are affordable in developing countries. In a bid to make Sovaldi available in 91 developing nations including in India, Gilead licensed the drug, hailed by doctors as a breakthrough in treating the liver-destroying disease, to seven India-based drugmakers in April last year. Campaigners, however, were critical of the licensing deals, saying they would not ensure access to several middle-income countries where health authorities would still struggle to provide treatment to patients.

Within a few days, Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager, dropped coverage of Gilead’s treatments in most cases in favor of the AbbVie therapy, citing a substantial discount.  Both breakthrough treatments for the first time can cure the liver-wasting disease in more than 90 percent of patients without the miserable side effects of older medicines.

Aetna, which posted an updated coverage policy on its website on Friday, said in a statement that it believes its price is “competitive with other recently announced agreements for this class of therapy.” Aetna and other insurers have pushed back against the high price of hepatitis C treatments and other drugs, questioning their affordability after Gilead’s first drug, Sovaldi, was priced at $84,000 per treatment, or roughly $1,000 per pill, in late 2013. The agreement followed a clinical review of other FDA-approved therapies for hepatitis C, which includes the late December approval of AbbVie Inc.’s competing treatment. Since that approval, AbbVie and Gilead have given discounts to their list prices of 30 percent or more, according to analysts. Aetna declined to comment on the size of the discount. The company said it is not updating its 2015 financial guidance at this time. The agreement follows similar announcements by pharmacy benefit managers Express Scripts Inc and CVS Health .

284,GILD,Gilead to appeal India patent ruling on hepatitis C drug,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - U.S.-based Gilead Sciences Inc  will appeal the Indian patent office’s rejection of its application for hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, a move that could allow local drugmakers to launch cheaper generic versions of the $1,000-a-pill medicine. The rejection relates to the patent application covering the metabolites, or small molecules, of sofosbuvir, the chemical name of Sovaldi. Indian drugmaker Natco Pharma and the Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK) had opposed Gilead’s application on the grounds that the drug is not inventive enough compared with a previous formulation. “Gilead strongly defends its intellectual property. The company will be appealing the decision as well as exploring additional procedural options,” the company said in a statement on Friday. It did not elaborate. The patent office order said Gilead’s request was rejected as “minor changes in the molecule” did not improve efficacy of the drug, which is normally given for either three or six months and costs $84,000 for a 12-week course in the United States. The rejection will allow Indian generic companies to make and sell cheaper versions in a country where a majority of the people live on less than $2 a day and health insurance is scarce. In a bid to make Sovaldi available in 91 developing nations including in India, Gilead licensed the drug, hailed by doctors as a breakthrough in treating the liver-destroying disease, to seven India-based drugmakers in April 2014. “These proceedings do not impact our commitment to enabling access to our hepatitis C medicines in India and other developing countries, and our generic licensing program with our Indian partners continues as normal,” the Gilead statement said.

286,GILD,PBM EnvisionRx chooses Gilead hepatitis C drugs for its formulary,"(Reuters) - Pharmacy benefits manager EnvisionRx said on Monday it reached an agreement to provide its customers with Gilead Sciences Inc’s hepatitis C drugs on an exclusive basis, the latest Gilead victory in a market share battle with AbbVie over their new treatments for the liver destroying virus. EnvisionRx said Gilead’s Sovaldi and its newer two-drug combination pill Harvoni would be available on its formulary, with other hepatitis C drugs, such as AbbVie’s Viekira Pak, allowed only as an exception in some cases. It was not disclosed how much of a price discount EnvisionRx negotiated from Gilead to secure the agreement. “The safety and efficacy profile of Gilead’s HCV products, coupled with the most competitive pricing in the drug class, have solidified EnvisionRx’s choice to place Gilead’s products in an exclusive and preferred formulary position,” said EnvisionRx President Dawn Sherman in a statement. Express Scripts Holding, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) which had complained about the high cost of Gilead’s first to market treatment, fired the first shot in the hepatitis C price war days after the AbbVie rival treatment was approved. It gave Viekira Pak preference on its formulary, excluding Gilead’s drugs. Gilead then locked up formulary exclusivity for Harvoni with CVS Health, the second largest U.S. PBM. PBMs negotiate drug pricing for employers and health plans. Health insurers have also chosen sides after negotiating their own discount deals following the Express Scripts move. Aetna, Anthem and Humana chose Gilead drugs as their preferred treatment, while PBM Prime Therapeutics kept both on its list. Both treatments have demonstrated an ability to cure well over 90 percent of patients, although Gilead’s Harvoni involves fewer drugs than Viekira. Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi with another drug, has a list price of $94,500 for 12 weeks of treatment. Viekira Pak  was listed at about $83,300.  Analysts believe the companies have been providing discounts of up to 30 percent, although the specific negotiated rebates have not been disclosed.

288,GILD,UnitedHealth backs Gilead's Harvoni as preferred hepatitis C treatment,"(Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, on Wednesday backed Gilead Sciences Inc’s Harvoni as the preferred hepatitis C treatment on its 2015 commercial drug coverage list, another victory for Gilead over competitor AbbVie Inc. Gilead and AbbVie have been battling for hepatitis C market share since the approval in December for an AbbVie drug that challenges Gilead’s blockbusters. Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been striking deals for preferred or exclusive status in exchange for discounts for 2015. UnitedHealth’s drug coverage list, which is effective Feb. 1, applies to all of the company’s commercial, fully insured customers who use its Optum RX pharmacy benefit manager and self-insured customers such as large employers who follow the drug list. The update to the formulary, available on the company’s website, also applies to its Medicaid, Medicare and military contracts.  “We are constantly working to deliver value and manage costs for customers and consumers throughout our business,” UnitedHealth spokesman Tyler Mason said in a statement. Gilead declined to comment.  Gilead set off a firestorm last year when it launched a breakthrough treatment for hepatitis C called Sovaldi that carries an $84,000-per-treatment price tag. Insurers, including UnitedHealth, were taken by surprise by its cost and called it out as an unexpected hit to profits last year.  Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit manager, pushed back against the price of Sovaldi and Gilead’s follow-up drug Harvoni, which has a list price of $93,400. It backed AbbVie’s Viekira Pak, saying it had gotten a significant discount. Analysts and investors say the treatments are being discounted by at least 30 percent. The companies have declined to comment. UnitedHealth is the last of the top three U.S. insurers to strike a deal with either Gilead or AbbVie. Reuters reported two weeks ago that Aetna Inc had backed Gilead, as have Anthem Inc and Humana Inc. Pharmacy benefit manager CVS Health also went with Gilead while smaller competitor Prime Therapeutics kept both on its list. The state of Missouri earlier this week said it had selected AbbVie’s Viekira Pak for Medicaid patients who meet certain criteria, and said the agreement would reduce treatment costs by 30 to 40 percent. UnitedHealth has 45 million medical customers. Of those, 18 million are employed by companies that are self-insured and use UnitedHealth to administer their plan benefits; not all those employers follow UnitedHealth’s commercial drug guideline or use UnitedHealth for their drug benefits.

291,GILD,UPDATE 2-AbbVie expects hep C drug sales to top $3 billion per year,"(Adds analyst comment) By Bill Berkrot Jan 30 (Reuters) - AbbVie Inc’s chief executive said on Friday the company’s new oral hepatitis C treatment Viekira Pak has the potential to capture a “meaningful share” of the U.S. market, where it is competing against Gilead Sciences . AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez told investors the company expects an annualized sales run rate of more than $3 billion by the end of 2015, which could grow as more countries begin using Viekira Pak. “We expect it to remain a large and attractive opportunity for many years to come,” Gonzalez said. AbbVie shares fell 3.6 percent to $60.85 as investors were disappointed by the Viekira forecast. “It was carefully worded in the most optimistic way possible,” BMO analyst Alex Arfaei said. An exit rate of above $3 billion in 2015, “indicates that sales in 2015 will be below $3 billion.” With Merck expected to launch its rival treatment in 2016, he said, “we expect additional price competition in this market.” Some analysts have forecast annual Gilead hepatitis C sales in excess of $15 billion. AbbVie and Gilead have been competing to nail down managed care contracts since Viekira Pak’s December U.S. approval after Express Scripts Holding, the largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), negotiated a lower price from AbbVie and excluded Gilead’s hepatitis treatments from its list of covered drugs. Gilead came under intense criticism for the $84,000 cost of its Sovaldi hepatitis C treatment and more expensive Harvoni combination pill. CVS Health, the second largest PBM, and the largest health insurers have since chosen Gilead’s drugs for preferential coverage. AbbVie said more than 40 percent of people who receive insurance coverage from a managed care company, such as CVS or Aetna, will have access to Viekira Pak, including 20 percent with exclusive coverage. More than half of all U.S. managed care lives are now under contract, Gonzalez estimated. He said AbbVie was working on several contracts expected to be finalized within 30 days. “Up to this point we are pleased with our formulary position and we believe we have the potential to capture meaningful share of the U.S. HCV market,” he added. Analysts have estimated that discounts offered for preferred drug status have exceeded 30 percent off list price. AbbVie declined to disclose details of its contracts. “We priced and rebated consistent with the value of our product and what we thought was appropriate for the market,” Gonzalez said. He said AbbVie offered the greatest discounts to plans willing to allow Viekira access to patients regardless of  severity of their liver damage. The company said 1,100 Viekira prescriptions were written through Jan. 16. It reported $48 million in Viekira sales in December, largely from inventory stocking.

294,GILD,"Gilead boosts hepatitis C drug discounts, shares slide","(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) on Tuesday said it is offering steeper-than-expected discounts on its hepatitis C drugs to health insurers and other group payers who had complained about the price, and the drugmaker’s shares slid more than 5 percent. Gilead executives disclosed the discounts on a conference call after the company said strong sales of the drugs, Harvoni and Sovaldi, helped boost net profit more than four-fold in the latest quarter, beating Wall Street forecasts. The executives said the “gross to net” adjustment for the company’s hepatitis C drug sales will average 46 percent in 2015, up sharply from 22 percent at the end of 2014. Many Wall Street analysts had projected hepatitis C sales based on discounts of 25 percent to 30 percent. Foster City, California-based Gilead also said it would start paying a quarterly dividend and devote $15 billion more to a share buyback plan. In late 2013, Gilead prompted howls of protests about prescription drug prices when it launched Sovaldi at a price of $1,000 a pill. But since AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) launched a rival hepatitis C treatment late last year, both companies have fought for market share by offering rebates to group payers.  Chief Operating Officer John Milligan said Gilead “will continue taking steps necessary” to provide wide access to its hepatitis C drugs, which have been shown to cure nearly all treated patients. Sales of Sovaldi totaled $1.73 billion for the quarter, while sales of follow-on drug Harvoni totaled $2.11 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast Sovaldi sales of $2.05 billion and Harvoni sales of $1.58 billion, according to Deutsche Bank. Gilead estimated that so far, 141,000 Americans have been started on one of its hepatitis C products, and it expects 250,000 to be treated this year. As many as 3.2 million people in the United States are estimated to be infected with the hepatitis C virus, which can lead to severe liver disease. For full year 2015, Gilead projected total product sales of $26 billion to $27 billion, short of the average Wall Street estimate of $28.6 billion. “The guidance is conservative,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. “They probably don’t want to be parading around huge sales for the course of the year as everyone is sensitive to this and everyone is watching them.” Gilead reported quarterly net income of $3.49 billion, or $2.18 per share, up from $791 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Gilead earned $2.43 per share, outstripping the average Wall Street estimate of $2.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 43 cents a share starting in the second quarter this year. Yee said that implies a yield of 1.6 percent. Gilead also announced a new $15 billion share buyback, in addition to $3 billion outstanding in its current buyback plan. The dividend and expanded share buyback “reflect the confidence we have in our business and our robust balance sheet,” said Chief Financial Officer Robin Washington. “This doesn’t prevent us in any way from investing in the pipeline, or M&A.;” After the trading session’s close, Gilead shares tumbled 5.4 percent to $101.44 on Nasdaq.

The company said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 43 cents a share starting in the second quarter this year. Yee said that implies a yield of 1.6 percent. Gilead also announced a new $15 billion share buyback, in addition to $3 billion outstanding in its current buyback plan. The dividend and expanded share buyback “reflect the confidence we have in our business and our robust balance sheet,” said Chief Financial Officer Robin Washington. “This doesn’t prevent us in any way from investing in the pipeline, or M&A.;” After the trading session’s close, Gilead shares tumbled 5.4 percent to $101.44 on Nasdaq.

300,GILD,Health insurer Aetna raises 2015 profit forecast,"(Reuters) - Aetna Inc (AET.N), the third largest U.S. health insurer, raised its 2015 profit forecast after negotiating a price cut from Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) on hepatitis C treatments for this year.  Aetna said the increased outlook was also due to momentum in its business early in the year after a strong finish to 2014. It boosted its full-year operating earnings forecast to at least $7.00 per share, up from $6.90. Aetna also reported quarterly profit in line with estimates. The stock rose more than 1 percent. Aetna reported an improved medical benefit ratio of 83 percent for the fourth quarter, compared with 83.9 percent a year earlier. The ratio is the amount an insurer spends on medical claims compared with its income from premiums. The company said the costs of medical care have remained moderate and that it expects its medical benefit ratio to be between 82 percent and 83 percent. Its comments on spending were in line with larger competitors UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Anthem Inc (ANTM.N). The company said the medical benefit ratio for commercial plans, its largest business, deteriorated to 82 percent from 81.7 percent, due to higher-than-expected medical costs in small businesses and expenses associated with the new hepatitis C treatments. Last year Aetna was among insurance companies and other payers who said that the $84,000 cost per treatment for Gilead’s new hepatitis C drug, which hit the market late in 2013, was unaffordable. When AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) launched a competing drug at the end of 2014, insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and others started negotiating for discounts from Gilead. Aetna said last month it had secured a lower cost and would back Gilead’s Harvoni drug as its preferred treatment over AbbVie’s. Aetna’s membership rose to 23.5 million at the end of 2014 from 22.2 million a year earlier, helped by growth in new insurance created by the national healthcare reform law, often called Obamacare. Aetna said it added 560,000 members from the Obamacare exchanges at the end of 2014 and expects that to increase to 800,000 by the end of the first quarter, helped by expansion into Georgia. The company reported operating earnings of $1.22 per share for the quarter, largely in line with average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue of $14.77 billion beat the average estimate of $14.60 billion. The company’s shares rose $1.01 to $93.23 on the New York Stock Exchange.

304,GILD,Gilead drags healthcare shares down on drug price worries,"(Reuters) - Healthcare shares plunged on Wednesday, lead by biotechnology stocks, after Gilead Sciences Inc said it gave health insurers steeper-than-expected discounts on its hepatitis C drugs, fueling worries that the broader sector would face increasing price pressure. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index fell as much as 3.85 percent, putting it on track for its biggest daily decline since Dec. 23 as biotech companies are seen to be under the most pressure to cut prices for their expensive-to-develop drugs. Gilead weighed most heavily on the biotechnology sector with a 8.9 percent drop in its shares but the biggest losers in the index were Pacific Biosciences of California, which fell 17.6 percent, followed by Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc, which lost 15.7 percent. Myriad Genetics dropped 11 percent. “Investors are in shock” about Gilead’s disclosure in its 2015 guidance that it expects to have to offer average discounts of 46 percent for the year, Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note, much deeper than the 25 percent he had expected. More traditional drug companies were also hurt as investors worried they would not be immune to the pressure from insurance companies to cut prices. The Standard & Poor’s 500 healthcare sector index fell 1.3 percent and was the second worst S&P; sector, weighed down by companies including Merck & Co, which was down 4 percent, and AbbVie Inc, which fell 6.9 percent.

306,GILD,Promising data bodes well for all-Achillion hep C treatment,"(Reuters) - Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc’s experimental hepatitis C drug, when used with Gilead Sciences Inc’s Sovaldi, eradicated signs of the virus in six weeks, the shortest duration and highest response achieved by any two-drug treatment. Achillion’s shares rose as much as 19 percent to $12.85 on Monday on investor’s hopes that an all-Achillion combination could be as effective as Gilead’s and AbbVie Inc’s current therapies. The estimated $20 billion market for hepatitis C drugs has developed at a lightning pace in recent years, with several companies including Gilead, AbbVie and Merck & Co Inc working on faster, more potent ways to cure the liver-destroying virus, which affects more than 170 million globally. The new-generation hepatitis C regimens use a two- to three-drug combination – a nucleotide analog inhibitor or “nuke” and a NS5A inhibitor in Gilead’s case – to achieves a cure in about eight to 12 weeks, making them faster and more effective than older treatment options. Gilead’s regimen Harvoni, with its own NS5A inhibitor and Sovaldi as the “nuke”, needs to be taken for at least eight weeks. Launched in October, its sales touched $2.11 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. AbbVie’s three-drug cocktail Viekira Pak, which won U.S. approval in December, must be taken for at least 12 weeks. Achillion’s ongoing mid-stage study tests its NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, with Sovaldi in previously untreated genotype 1 hepatitis C patients over six and eight weeks of therapy.  The main goal is to achieve a cure, or sustained virological response, 12 weeks after the completion of therapy. Monday’s data shows Achillion’s NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, looks best-in-class, which could make up for its nuke, ACH-3422, being perhaps less effective than Sovaldi, analysts said. The question then becomes whether ACH-3422 plus ACH-3102 - a weaker nuke and a stronger NS5A inhibitor - could be a good enough doublet as Harvoni, William Blair’s Katherine Xu said. Achillion, one of the few companies developing hepatitis C therapies independently, plans to begin a mid-stage study this year to evaluate its proprietary doublet. The all-Achillion regimen could hit the U.S. market by 2020 in a conservative scenario, Deutsche Bank’s Alethia Young estimated. She expects the treatment to cost about $35,000 per patient per year, assuming a 55 percent discount. Harvoni’s list price is $93,400 and Viekira Pak is estimated to cost $83,319.

China’s exports fell 3.3 percent from a year ago while imports tumbled 19.9 percent, far worse than expectations, raising concerns about the world’s second-largest economy.

309,GILD,UPDATE 2-Promising data bodes well for all-Achillion hep C treatment,"* Study shows Achillion’s inhibitor looks best-in-class: analyst * All-Achillion combination could rival Gilead, AbbVie treatments * Achillion to begin testing its own combination this year * Shares rise as much as 19 pct   (Adds detail, analyst comment; updates shares) By Natalie Grover Feb 9 (Reuters) - Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc’s experimental hepatitis C drug, when used with Gilead Sciences Inc’s Sovaldi, eradicated signs of the virus in six weeks, the shortest duration and highest response achieved by any two-drug treatment. Achillion’s shares rose as much as 19 percent to $12.85 on Monday on investor’s hopes that an all-Achillion combination could be as effective as Gilead’s and AbbVie Inc’s current therapies. The estimated $20 billion market for hepatitis C drugs has developed at a lightning pace in recent years, with several companies including Gilead, AbbVie and Merck & Co Inc  working on faster, more potent ways to cure the liver-destroying virus, which affects more than 170 million globally. The new-generation hepatitis C regimens use a two- to three-drug combination - a nucleotide analog inhibitor or “nuke” and a NS5A inhibitor in Gilead’s case - to achieves a cure in about eight to 12 weeks, making them faster and more effective than older treatment options. Gilead’s regimen Harvoni, with its own NS5A inhibitor and Sovaldi as the “nuke”, needs to be taken for at least eight weeks. Launched in October, its sales touched $2.11 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. AbbVie’s three-drug cocktail Viekira Pak, which won U.S. approval in December, must be taken for at least 12 weeks. Achillion’s ongoing mid-stage study tests its NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, with Sovaldi in previously untreated genotype 1 hepatitis C patients over six and eight weeks of therapy. The main goal is to achieve a cure, or sustained virological response, 12 weeks after the completion of therapy. Monday’s data shows Achillion’s NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, looks best-in-class, which could make up for its nuke, ACH-3422, being perhaps less effective than Sovaldi, analysts said. The question then becomes whether ACH-3422 plus ACH-3102 - a weaker nuke and a stronger NS5A inhibitor - could be a good enough doublet as Harvoni, William Blair’s Katherine Xu said. Achillion, one of the few companies developing hepatitis C therapies independently, plans to begin a mid-stage study this year to evaluate its proprietary doublet. The all-Achillion regimen could hit the U.S. market by 2020 in a conservative scenario, Deutsche Bank’s Alethia Young estimated. She expects the treatment to cost about $35,000 per patient per year, assuming a 55 percent discount. Harvoni’s list price is $93,400 and Viekira Pak is estimated to cost $83,319.

313,GILD,Gilead expects big increase in Europeans treated with hep C drug,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc said on Tuesday it expects the number of hepatitis C patients treated in Europe with its Sovaldi drug to increase dramatically this year, and that approvals for the newer combination pill, Harvoni, could come quickly. The company, which has come under intense criticism in the United States for the high price of its treatments for the liver destroying virus, is negotiating price cuts in Europe in exchange for patient volume promises. Unlike the United States, where it is left to insurers and pharmacy benefit managers to negotiate price cuts for expensive drugs, price controls on medicines have long been a reality in Europe. Gilead President and Chief Operating Officer John Milligan said about 17,000 hepatitis C patients were treated in France last year under a temporary utilization program. “This year they will increase that budget allotment fairly dramatically in return for some price/volume concessions. If they commit to certain volumes, we’ll commit to certain price concessions,” Milligan said at the Bio CEO&Investor; conference in New York. Similar arrangements have been made in Spain and in Italy, which has among the highest prevalence of hepatitis C in Europe, he said. “Italy has committed to volumes this year that I believe are about three times the volume they have ever treated,” Milligan said. Sovaldi must be used with at least one other drug to produce cure rates well in excess of 90 percent.  The company’s Harvoni drug, which combines Sovaldi with another Gilead anti-viral medicine into a one pill once a day treatment, won U.S. approval late last year. Gilead is currently in talks on gaining patient access to Harvoni in Europe, which could accelerate 2015 sales that many analysts expect to exceed $12 billion worldwide. “Negotiations for approvals of Harvoni are going very, very fast,” Milligan said. “Payers see the value of it and see that  more patients can benefit than ever before. That means we can bring more patients onto Harvoni sooner than we anticipated.” Some investors have expressed concern that short duration treatments will ultimately limit hepatitis C drug sales, compared with Gilead’s HIV drugs that patients may have to take for decades. Milligan estimates it will take six years to exhaust the estimated 1.6 million patients already diagnosed in the United States alone. “On top of that, about an equal number need to be diagnosed,” he said. “So it plays out over a much longer period of time.” ",2102015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gilead-hepatitis-europe/gilead-expects-big-increase-in-europeans-treated-with-hep-c-drug-idUSKBN0LE2T720150210

315,GILD,Bristol hep C drug helps cure 97 percent of HIV coinfected patients: study,"(Reuters) - Ninety-seven percent of hepatitis C patients also infected with HIV were cured of the liver-destroying virus after 12 weeks of treatment with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s daclatasvir and Gilead Sciences’ Sovaldi, according to data from a study presented on Thursday. The results could help put Bristol’s hepatitis C program back on track in the United States, following a setback last year. In the Ally-2 study, including new patients and those not helped by prior treatment, 149 of 153 were deemed cured of hepatitis C regardless of what other anti-viral regimens they were on for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. “The results of Ally-2 signaled that nearly all HIV-HCV coinfected patients in the study could be cured of hepatitis C with a 12-week regimen on daclatasvir and sofosbuvir,” Dr. David Wyles, the study’s lead investigator, said in a statement, using the chemical name for Sovaldi. There were no reported serious side effects related to the hepatitis drugs, and patients did not require any alteration of HIV medications over potential drug-drug interactions. “This is a paramount consideration for clinicians treating this patient population,” added Wyles, who presented the data at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI) meeting in Seattle. About 300,000 Americans with HIV also suffer from hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, making them prone to more rapid progression to liver damage. Daclatasvir is approved in Europe, Brazil and Japan as part of combination therapy, but has fallen behind rivals in the world’s most lucrative market. In November, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration declined to approve daclatasvir in combination with other antiviral drugs. The company had sought FDA permission to market daclatasvir in combination with another Bristol drug, asunaprevir. But Bristol abandoned its U.S. marketing application for asunaprevir due to potential competition from more potent drugs, leaving the FDA without data to gauge the effectiveness of daclatasvir as part of a combination regimen. The FDA asked for new data on daclatasvir with other drugs, which the Ally results could help satisfy. Sovaldi is part of Gilead’s market-leading hepatitis C franchise and half of its own one-pill-per-day combination treatment Harvoni. All 26 patients in the Ally-2 study with the less common genotypes 2, 3 and 4 of the virus were cured by the combination. A shorter eight-week regimen tested among 50 patients led to a 75 percent cure rate.

317,GILD,UPDATE 1-India's Natco Pharma ties up with Gilead on hepatitis C drugs,"* Natco says deal covers 91 developing nations * Natco to pay Gilead royalties on sales of drugs   (Adds comments from Delhi Network of Positive People, BDR Pharma MD, stock price) MUMBAI, March 2 (Reuters) - India’s Natco Pharma Ltd  said on Monday it has agreed a deal with Gilead Sciences Inc to supply generic copies of the U.S. drugmaker’s chronic hepatitis C medicines, including $1,000-a-pill drug Sovaldi, in 91 developing nations. Natco, a mid-sized player in India’s crowded pharmaceutical industry, is the latest generic drugmaker to team up with Gilead on Sovaldi, having previously attempted to block the U.S. firm from getting a patent for the breakthrough drug in India in the hope of producing a cheaper version on its own. In September, Gilead announced similar licensing deals with seven other generic drugmakers. Sovaldi, chemically known as sofosbuvir, is a far more effective and better-tolerated treatment than older injection products, and racked up $1.7 billion in sales for Gilead in the fourth quarter alone. But the firm has come under fire over the drug’s price tag, its cost presenting a huge barrier in poorer countries. About 150 million people in the world live with chronic hepatitis C infection, most of them in low- and middle-income countries. Drugs under the deal with Natco include sofosbuvir (Sovaldi), a combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir - a follow-on drug called Harvoni - and a treatment known as GS-5816, which is in late-stage clinical trials, Natco said in a statement. As with the other deals, Natco will fix its own price for the generic versions, and will pay a royalty on sales to Gilead. Natco had earlier joined the New York-based Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK), the Delhi Network of Positive People, and privately-held BDR Pharmaceuticals International Ltd in filing opposition to a patent on Sovaldi in India. A Natco spokesman did not immediately respond to a request seeking further details on the deal announced on Monday. In early reactions, some of those who had opposed a patent for Sovaldi said the Natco deal hadn’t altered their position. “We do not think this weakens our case. The drug’s prices may be low under the deals, but they can be much lower without a patent, so we will continue to oppose it,” said Vikas Ahuja, President of the Delhi Network of Positive People. BDR Pharma Managing Director Dharmesh Shah declined to comment on Natco’s Gilead deal, but said he was not seeking a similar contract. Natco shares were up 3 percent at 0837 GMT on Monday, while the wider Mumbai market was down 0.2 percent.

321,GILD,CORRECTED-US STOCKS-Wall St little changed as energy retreats,"(Removes reference to Nasdaq intraday record in paragraph 2) * Dollar dips but oversupply worry weighs on oil * Gilead Pharma shares fall, biotech index down * Indexes: Dow up 0.34 pct, S&P; up 0.18 pct, Nasdaq off 0.01 pct By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, March 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed on Monday on the heels of a rally in the prior week, as investors weighed fluctuations in the dollar and its impact on other markets, including crude prices. The Nasdaq was less than 0.5 percent of a closing record set on March 10, 2000. Equity market gains ebbed and flowed, tracking the behavior of energy stocks as crude oil prices were caught between the weakness in the U.S. dollar and concerns about oversupply. The S&P; 500 energy sector was up 0.1 percent after earlier gaining as much as 0.9 percent. The action in the dollar has closely affected stocks of late as traders anticipate monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve some time later this year. The 20-day correlation between the dollar index and the S&P; 500 sits at -0.79. The dollar index was down 0.9 percent on the day. The recent dollar strength “is probably already at the point where it is going to have a significant impact to earnings,” said Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. While the dollar’s rise has been beneficial for consumers, its rapid strengthening has been a problem for a large portion of the market, such as commodities firms and exporters. “Given what is going on with commodity prices and what is going on with energy prices, if anything the inflation news is getting better, not worse,” said Massocca. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 62.07 points, or 0.34 percent, to 18,189.72, the S&P; 500 gained 3.81 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,111.91 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 0.37 points, or 0.01 percent, to 5,026.05. Brent slipped 0.3 percent, while U.S. crude  added 0.2 percent even after top exporter Saudi Arabia said it would only mull cutting output if producers outside OPEC do so as well. Kansas City Southern shares dropped 7.8 percent to $106.70 as the worst performer on the S&P; 500 after the railroad cut its full year revenue forecast. Gilead Sciences shares fell 1.9 percent to $100.33 after a report said nine patients taking its hepatitis C drugs along with a heart treatment developed abnormally slow heartbeats and one died.

322,GILD,Gilead shares dip after warning about hepatitis C drug interaction,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc shares slid 2 percent on Monday after the company warned about potentially fatal risks for patients being treated with its top-selling hepatitis c drugs who also take the potent heart drug amiodarone. Gilead said it sent cautionary emails to healthcare providers on Friday to notify them of nine cases in which patients treated with its Harvoni or Sovaldi, while also taking amiodarone, suffered a slow heart beat condition known as symptomatic bradycardia. One of the patients died. The condition was seen almost immediately in six of the patients. Three of the nine required the placement of a pacemaker and seven had also been taking a beta blocker, which slows heart rates. The labels on the hepatitis C drugs already contain a warning against co-administration with amiodarone and particularly in patients also taking beta blockers. AbbVie’s  rival hepatitis C treatment Viekira Pak carries a similar warning. “We believe this disclosure will have little or no effect on demand for Harvoni and Sovaldi,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note. “First, the underlying patient numbers on amiodarone are relatively small. Second, there is no inherent reason that hepatitis C-infected individuals should have much higher rates of treatment with amiodarone, so the exclusion of co-administration is unlikely to materially affect the dynamics of the market,” he said. Sovaldi had fourth quarter sales of $1.7 billion, while the newer combination treatment Harvoni, which includes Sovaldi, had sales of $2.1 billion for the period. Gilead, in a statement, said “it remains confident in the safety profiles of Sovaldi and Harvoni” and will continue to monitor their safety in collaboration with health regulators and the medical community. Amiodarone is an older drug used to keep the heart beating normally in patients with life threatening rhythm disorders, such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. It has a history of potentially dangerous toxicities. The new hepatitis C drugs represent a major breakthrough as they can cure well over 90 percent of patients who have the liver destroying virus with virtually none of the troubling side effects of older treatments. Gilead shares were down $2.05, or 2 percent, at $100.24 on Nasdaq.

325,GILD,Gilead uses Georgia as free-drug testbed for hepatitis C elimination,"LONDON (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences is seeking to convince governments and multilateral agencies worldwide that hepatitis C can be eliminated with a demonstration project in Georgia offering free drugs to all those who need them. The unprecedented program will make the Caucasian country a testbed for uprooting the liver-destroying disease, using Gilead’s highly effective but costly pill Sovaldi, plus its newer product Harvoni once approved. Georgia has the world’s third highest prevalence of hepatitis C, after Egypt and Mongolia, with nearly 7 percent of adults carrying the virus. It also has a wide range of viral variations and different types of patients. What is more, the country is a manageable size, with a population of around 5 million, and has viral screening systems, making it ideal for scientific study, according to Gregg Alton, the U.S. drugmaker’s head of corporate and medical affairs. “It is a nice country for us to evaluate,” he said in a telephone interview on Wednesday from the European Association for the Study of the Liver annual meeting in Vienna. The scheme, which has the backing of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will cover an initial 5,000 patients in 2015, with a second phase treating up to 20,000 a year. Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs, and rival products from the likes of AbbVie, can cure hepatitis C but are out of reach at Western prices to patients in poor countries, with a single Sovaldi pill costing $1,000 in the United States. While Gilead has slashed the price for several low-income countries to $300 per bottle of 28 pills, it also wants to involve international donors in a broad eradication drive. “We will take the Georgia data to other countries around the world to really make the case that investment can fundamentally change the disease over time,” Alton said. Alton admits the scheme may prompt other governments to ask for free drugs as well, but he said it was unrealistic to simply give away product globally. Instead, he wants to see international funding along the lines of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. “Gilead cannot cure hepatitis C globally on our backs alone. There have to be other players that come in and make that investment,” he said.

326,GILD,Wall St Week Ahead-Investors seek protection against healthcare stock decline,"NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - Healthcare companies on a seven-year tear have been top performers so far in 2015, helping to push broad stock indexes to record levels, but traders are now looking to protect themselves from a selloff as they await major earnings reports in the sector. Companies reporting first-quarter earnings next week include Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co, Boston Scientific Corp , Merck & Co, Pfizer Inc, Gilead Sciences Inc and Celgene Corp. So far, companies that have reported in this sector have seen positive moves in share prices, and many investors say they think healthcare stocks have room to run. But options traders are not taking chances. Options on a key healthcare exchange-traded fund (ETF) are set near their most defensive posture ever. So far this year, the S&P; healthcare sector index  has risen 8.7 percent, leading all other S&P; sector indexes. Since 2008, it has increased 179 percent while the broader S&P; 500 is up 135 percent. On Thursday, healthcare’s strong performance helped push the S&P; 500 to an intraday record and the Nasdaq composite index to its all-time closing high. Investors have been drawn to healthcare stocks by a spate of mergers and expectations for more buyouts on top of major drug launches and strong demand from an aging population. “It’s kind of tough to punch holes into the healthcare bull story,” said Sven Borho, founding general partner at health specialist fund OrbiMed Advisors LLC, in New York. “What worries me is the long stretch of outperformance relative to the rest of the market,” he said. Even so, “it’s not that healthcare valuations broadly have gone off the roof.” The sector is trading at 18.8 times earnings estimates for the year ahead compared to S&P;’s P/E ratio of 17.5. Traders in the options market, however, are preparing for possible downside. Activity in puts, which can be used to hedge against a drop in shares, has picked up noticeably in April for the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF. The average daily puts volume has risen to 16,000, from 9,000 for the first three months of 2015. For every call option, usually used for bullish bets, there are 4.6 put options open, the highest ratio since early 2007, right after their launch, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. “It’s really just a function of investors looking to protect their gains,” said Max Breier, senior equity derivatives trader at BMO Capital Markets. “In a market cap-weighted ETF like the XLV, if you get a number of the top-weighted names kind of disappointing at once you can get a pretty violent reaction,” Breier said. Companies reporting next week include Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co, Boston Scientific Corp, Merck & Co, Pfizer Inc, Gilead Sciences Inc and Celgene Corp. Medical device maker Boston Scientific is the second-best S&P; healthcare performer with a 39-percent share price gain so far this year. The most accurate analysts say it could meet earnings per share estimates for 20.4 cents per share or miss by a thread, according to StarMine. Gilead could beat analysts’ $2.30 EPS estimate by over 22 cents while Bristol-Meyers and Celgene could beat their EPS estimates by about a penny, according to StarMine. Shares are more likely to react to comments about drug studies or pricing than to results, Borho said. Wall Street analysts expect the S&P; healthcare sector to report a 10.2 percent first-quarter earnings increase, compared with 7.2 percent expected on April 1 and 12.4 percent in October, Reuters data showed. Other big events investors will watch next week include  first-quarter GDP numbers and the Federal Reserve’s statement after its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Apple Inc  reports earnings on Monday afternoon in a week when oil companies are expected to report grim results.

327,GILD,Gilead first-quarter profit doubles on strong hepatitis C drug sales,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc on Thursday said its quarterly profit nearly doubled, driven by strong sales of its hepatitis C drugs, as it topped Wall Street estimates. Gilead signaled that, with its hepatitis C franchise established, it is a good time for the company to consider business development opportunities. “We want to stick very closely to therapeutic areas we are in today,” Gilead Chief Operating Officer John Milligan said on a conference call. Excluding items, Gilead earned $2.94 per share in the first quarter, beating the average Wall Street estimate of $2.32, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s shares, which fell 1.8 percent in regular trading, rose 2 percent to $102.52 after hours. Product sales rose 52 percent to $7.41 billion, including $4.55 billion for hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. Analysts had expected hepatitis C sales of $3.54 billion, according to Deutsche Bank. “It was an extremely strong quarter,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, noting that the sales guidance “signals confidence in the year.” Gilead said it now expects full-year product sales of $28 billion to $29 billion, up from a previous estimate of $26 billion to $27 billion. In late 2013, Gilead prompted howls of protest about prescription drug prices when it launched Sovaldi at $1,000 a pill, and later Harvoni at an even higher price. But since AbbVie Inc launched a rival treatment late last year, both have fought for market share by offering rebates to group payers. Gilead said earlier this year that its “gross-to-net” adjustment for hepatitis C sales would average 46 percent in 2015. The company declined to revisit that estimate on Thursday. Gilead said more than 70,000 U.S. patients and 20,000 European patients were started on its hepatitis C drugs in the first quarter. Because the drugs cure nearly all patients, the market opportunity is limited. Around 3.3 million Americans are believed to be infected with the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus, but only about half of them are aware that they are infected. Gilead posted net income of $4.3 billion, or $2.76 per share, up from $2.2 billion, or $1.33 per share, a year earlier.     Cash on hand at the end of the quarter totaled $14.5 billion. “They could pretty much buy anything,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges. “The big question is whether they are going to swing the big bat that they have at their disposal.”      ",4302015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gilead-sciences-results/gilead-first-quarter-profit-doubles-on-strong-hepatitis-c-drug-sales-idUSKBN0NL2KS20150430

Upbeat economic reports added to uncertainty about the outlook for interest rates, a day after data showed the U.S. economy had slowed to a crawl in the first quarter and the Federal Reserve pointed to weakness in the labor market and other areas of the U.S. economy. Despite the day’s decline, all three major indexes posted slight gains for April. The Nasdaq biotech index dropped 3.1 percent on Thursday, led by a 4.5 percent fall in Celgene, which reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue. The decline marked a fifth day of losses for the biotech index, which was down 8.1 percent for the week so far. The Nasdaq fell for a fourth straight day, and was off 3 percent from Friday’s record closing high. The S&P; tech index  slid 1.6 percent, the day’s worst-performing sector, while small-cap stocks also underperformed. The Russell 2000 small-cap index was down 2.2 percent. Apple, down 2.7 percent at $125.15, was the biggest drag on the three major indexes. The company limited the availability of the Apple Watch after a key component was found to be defective, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Biotechs and tech were leaders and now they’ve reversed,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. “Earnings don’t really support the valuations at this time, and I think the market needs to correct a bit. As we go into May I would say the best prescription would be to sell in May and go away.” The Dow Jones industrial average fell 195.01 points, or 1.08 percent, to 17,840.52, the S&P; 500 lost 21.34 points, or 1.01 percent, to 2,085.51 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 82.22 points, or 1.64 percent, to 4,941.42. For the month, the Dow was up 0.4 percent, the S&P; 500 gained 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.8 percent. The day’s data included a report showing the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits tumbled to a 15-year low last week. After the bell, LinkedIn shares fell 24 percent to $191.70 and Gilead shares gained 3.2 percent to $103.69 following the release of results. First Solar and SunPower both declined after hours following results. During the regular session, Baidu declined 8.5 percent to $200.28 after China’s dominant Internet search engine provider reported its slowest quarterly revenue growth rate in almost seven years. S&P; 500 earnings for the first quarter now are expected to have risen 1.1 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed, while revenue was expected to be down 3.2 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 2,355 to 693; on the Nasdaq, 2,131 issues fell and 647 advanced.

Apple gave the three major indexes their biggest boost, with a 2.3 percent increase to $128.01, reversing Thursday’s decline. The S&P; tech sector was up 1.2 percent, while the Nasdaq was on track to snap a four-day losing streak. Biotech shares also rebounded and were set to snap a five-day losing streak. The Nasdaq Biotech Index was up 2.7 percent. Shares of Gilead rose 5.2 percent to $105.78 after its quarterly profit nearly doubled. The S&P; healthcare index was up 1.3 percent and among the day’s best-performing sectors. “Today’s the first day of a new month, and we’re seeing a lot of institutional buying coming in,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. “The buy-the-dippers have come in” to bid up stocks, which is a sign of a healthy market. Indexes were still on track to post losses for the week, however. Social media shares were among the weakest performers following disappointing outlooks and results this week from several key players including Twitter. LinkedIn dropped 19 percent to $204.07, a day after reporting results. Investors were also buoyed by an encouraging batch of data for April that suggested the economy was pulling out of a first-quarter soft patch. At 3:20 p.m. the Dow Jones industrial average rose 169.69 points, or 0.95 percent, to 18,010.21, the S&P; 500  gained 20.5 points, or 0.98 percent, to 2,106.01 and the Nasdaq Composite added 56.78 points, or 1.15 percent, to 4,998.20. Consumer sentiment jumped and vehicle sales were stronger-than-expected in April, while manufacturing expansion in the month held steady at near a two-year low. Railcar makers gained after tougher oil-train safety standards, including rules to phase out older tank cars in three years, were announced.

Investors were also buoyed by an encouraging batch of data for April that suggested the economy was pulling out of a first-quarter soft patch. Consumer sentiment jumped and vehicle sales were stronger-than-expected in April, while manufacturing expansion in the month held steady at near a two-year low. “We anticipate a little bit of a pick up in the second and third quarter,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. “Its not going to be enough to warrant the Fed to raise rates but its certainly not weak enough to push us into recession.” At 13:39 p.m. EDT (1739 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was up 128.08 points, or 0.72 percent, at 17,968.6, the S&P; 500 was up 15.29 points, or 0.73 percent, at 2,100.8 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 37.52 points, or 0.76 percent, at 4,978.94. If the gains hold, all three indexes are on track for their best day since April 20. Still, the three are headed to close lower for the week. Social media stock were lower as LinkedIn’s results capped a weak quarter for the sector.

A majority of the 10 major S&P; indexes were higher, with the health and tech both snapping a 2-day losing streak.

The Nasdaq biotech index was up 2.6 percent, snapping a 5-day losing streak and on track for its best day since April 8. Gilead led the gains with a 3 percent increase to $103.53 after its quarterly profit nearly doubled, driven by strong sales of its hepatitis C drugs. The stock was the second-largest boost on the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq. “Its a new month and big institutional investors that allocate on a monthly basis are still moving money into the market,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York.

GlobeImmune, which is developing the drug with Gilead Sciences Inc, is among several drugmakers looking to tap the demand for hepatitis B treatments as hepatitis C drugs flood the market. Hepatitis B is being seen as the next big opportunity in the liver disease market as it is the most common liver infection, affecting about 400 million people worldwide. However, hepatitis B infection is much more difficult to treat than hepatitis C. GlobeImmune, which had a market value of $47 million as of Tuesday’s close, is developing three other drugs for infectious diseases and five for different types of cancers. In the trial, the company’s hepatitis B drug, GS-4774, was tested in 178 patients who were already on oral antiviral treatment. Gilead’s liver drugs portfolio includes its blockbuster hepatitis C drug Sovaldi and Harvoni and the company has another hepatitis B candidate, GS-9620, in its pipeline. With GS-4774 failing the study, Gilead would have to look at other drug developers to find the right hepatitis B drug for its portfolio, analysts said. Other companies developing hepatitis B drugs include Arrowhead Research Corp, Canada’s Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp , Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc  and Assembly Biosciences Inc. “(Gilead)... is probably watching two leading albeit early players in Hep B: Tekmira and Assembly Biosciences,” RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. GlobeImmune’s shares were down 51.7 percent at $3.98 in noon trading on the Nasdaq on Wednesday. The stock, which was the top percentage loser on the exchange, hit a record low of $3.33 earlier in the session.

340,GILD,China rejects patent linked to Gilead hepatitis C drug,"NEW YORK/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has rejected a Gilead Sciences Inc patent application related to its costly hepatitis C drug, a U.S. advocacy group said, adding the move may lead to other countries to consider rejecting patents for the controversial treatment. Gilead has drawn fire for the cost of its top-selling drug Sovaldi, priced at $1,000 per pill in the United States or $84,000 for a typical 12-week course and its patents have been challenged in the U.S., India and Europe. The application China has rejected was for a so-called prodrug, the inactive form of the drug which then converts into the chemically active compound once in the body, the New York-based Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK) said. Gilead, however, holds the China patent to the base compound in the drug, also known by its generic name sofosbuvir and  China’s rejection of the prodrug patent does not open the way for copycat drugs to be made in the world’s No. 2 drug market. China-based officials for Gilead were not immediately available for comment. Emails and calls to Gilead’s U.S. offices outside office hours went unanswered. Officials at China’s State Intellectual Property Office did not confirm the decision when contacted by Reuters, but a notice posted on the body’s website said Gilead’s application for “nucleoside phosphramidates”, a kind of prodrug, had recently been rejected. China’s move follows a decision by India’s patent office in January to reject Gilead’s patent application for Sovaldi, finding it was not inventive enough. Gilead is appealing the ruling. Under pressure to cut prices, the California-based firm agreed last year to make the drug available for lower prices in 91 developing countries. I-MAK has brought legal challenges against Gilead’s patents or patent applications in five countries not covered by the agreement: China, Argentina, Brazil, Russia and Ukraine. Charities in Europe have also challenged Gilead’s patent over its prices. The World Health Organization says as many as 150 million people worldwide live with chronic hepatitis C infection, most of them in low and middle-income countries. It recently added Sovaldi to its essential medicines list and urged lower prices, especially in middle income countries.

341,GILD,China rejects Gilead hepatitis C drug patent -advocacy group,"June 19 (Reuters) - China has rejected Gilead Sciences Inc’s application for a new patent related to its costly hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, removing a potential barrier to generic versions of the drug there, a U.S. legal group announced on Friday. The New York-based group, Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge, or I-MAK, challenged Gilead’s patent application this year as part of its campaign to make generic Sovaldi available in several countries. The group said on Friday it had received notice of the patent application rejection from officials in the China State Intellectual Property Office. I-MAK said it challenged the Gilead patent applications in China and other countries so hepatitis C patients could get cheaper generic versions of the drug. Tahir Amin, I-MAK’s director of intellectual property, said the latest decision makes it more likely that advocates may challenge another Gilead drug patent in China that currently prevents the introduction of generic treatments for hepatitis C. The application China has rejected was on a so-called prodrug, a chemical used to activate Sovaldi’s active chemical once it is in the body, according to I-MAK. Gilead still has a patent in China on sofosbuvir, the main ingredient of Sovaldi, a highly effective treatment for hepatitis C which costs $1,000 per pill in the United States. That adds up to $84,000 for a typical 12-week course. California-based Gilead agreed last year to make the drug available for lower prices in 91 developing countries, although I-MAK has said that more than 59 million low-income hepatitis C patients worldwide are still without access to the drug. In May I-MAK said it had brought legal challenges against Gilead’s patents or patent applications in five countries not covered by the agreement: China, Argentina, Brazil, Russia and Ukraine. Amin said he believed the decision by China’s patent office to reject the prodrug patent application would encourage challenges to the sofosbuvir patent as well. If that patent were invalidated, he said, it would open the door for Chinese companies to sell generic Sovaldi, as well as to supply raw materials for the drug to manufacturers in other countries. In January, India’s patent office refused to grant Gilead a patent on Sovaldi, finding it was not inventive enough. Gilead is appealing the ruling. Last month, the United Nations’ World Health Organization added Sovaldi to its essential medicines list and urged lower prices, especially in middle income countries.

342,GILD,"Gilead hepatitis C sales beat Wall Street, sales outlook raised","(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) said on Tuesday sales of its hepatitis C drugs hit a record of nearly $5 billion, surpassing Wall Street estimates as strong demand offset pricing pressures and restrictions on patient use from U.S. health insurers. Excluding items, Gilead earned $3.15 a share in the second quarter, beating the $2.71 average forecast by Wall Street analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Gilead raised its outlook for full-year 2015 product sales by $1 billion to between $29 billion and $30 billion. The company’s shares, which rose 2.3 percent to close at $113.07 in regular Nasdaq trading, were up another 3 percent at $116.36 after hours. Gilead faced a backlash from health insurers and other payers when it launched in late 2013 hepatitis C drug Sovaldi at a price of $84,000 for a course of treatment, followed last year by next-generation drug Harvoni at a slightly higher price. The regimens cure most patients of the liver-destroying infection. The company acknowledged earlier this year that it had negotiated price discounts for the two drugs averaging 46 percent with a range of payers in return for multiyear contracts. “As the market starts to become a bit more predictable in terms of numbers of patients, payers will be more encouraged to open the gates slightly,” Paul Carter, head of commercial operations at Gilead, said on a conference call, referring to treatment guidelines put in place by payers looking to control their costs.  He said Gilead expects 250,000 to 300,000 U.S. hepatitis C patients a year to undergo treatment in coming years, with the main variable being payer restrictions. In Europe, Carter said there has been an early spike in hepatitis C sales volumes as the most ill patients seek treatment. Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges called Gilead’s quarterly results “spectacular,” adding that the higher 2015 sales forecast “suggests that there’s substantial EPS upside versus current consensus.”     Product sales rose 27 percent to $8.1 billion, including $4.9 billion for hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. Analysts had expected hepatitis C drug sales of $4.27 billion, according to Deutsche Bank. Gilead, based in Foster City, California, also raised the lower end of its full-year profit margin forecast to 88 percent from 87 percent, while leaving the top end unchanged at 90 percent. It also lowered the range for its 2015 tax rate to between 17 percent and 18 percent from a previous 18 percent to 20 percent. “The company raised revenue and lowered expense guidance. You can’t ask for better than that,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.  Also on the conference call, Gilead Chief Operating Officer John Milligan reiterated that the company, which had cash holdings of $14.7 billion at the end of June, remains open to deal-making in the form of small transactions, or large “perhaps transformative deals.” ",7282015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gilead-results/gilead-hepatitis-c-sales-beat-wall-street-sales-outlook-raised-idUSKCN0Q22EJ20150728

344,GILD,US STOCKS-Wall Street ends sharply higher as China jitters ebb,"* Some say December rate hike now more likely * Focus on corporate results eclipses China worry * Twitter and Gilead up after the bell; Yelp drops * Indexes close up: Dow 1.09 pct, S&P; 1.24 pct, Nasdaq 0.98 pct   (Updates to close) By Noel Randewich July 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended sharply higher on Tuesday, breaking a five-day losing streak as attention shifted from trouble in Chinese equities to U.S. corporate earnings and to speculation the first Federal Reserve interest rate hike may not come until December. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P; 500 chalked up gains of more than 1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite lagged slightly. After the S&P; sank over the past week toward the low end of a range it has traded in since February, some investors wagered the market was primed for a technical bounce-back. “The S&P; has had five down days in a row and a lot of people are starting to nibble,” said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc in San Antonio, which manages about $1 billion. Market sentiment also reflected expectations the Fed would wait until December, rather than September, to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006, Matousek added. With a two-day Fed policy meeting ending on Wednesday, investors are looking for hints about the timing of that rate increase. No move on rates is expected this week. “September is possible but the probability for a December rate hike is increasing,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.09 percent, to end the session at 17,630.27. The S&P; 500 gained 1.24 percent to 2,093.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.98 percent to finish at 5,089.21. All the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors rose, with the energy index leaping 2.99 percent as oil prices recovered from near six-month lows. U.S. consumer confidence weakened in July to its lowest level since September, due in part to a less optimistic outlook on the labor market. Ongoing uncertainty related to China’s stock market, which closed lower again on Tuesday, took a backseat to U.S. corporate earnings. With second-quarter reports well under way, analysts now expect overall earnings of S&P; 500 companies to edge up 0.3 percent and revenue to decline 4.0 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Earnings are growing but very slowly. The market’s biggest concern is the lack of top-line growth and where that growth is going to come from,” said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer of Exencial Wealth Advisors, which oversees $1.3 billion. After the bell, Twitter jumped 5.2 percent and Gilead Sciences rose 3 percent after both companies posted their second-quarter results. Yelp slumped 13 percent after its report. During Tuesday’s session, SuperValu jumped 10.60 percent. It said it was exploring a spinoff of its discount grocery chain Save-A-Lot into a publicly-traded company. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2.7 to 1. On the Nasdaq, 1.67 stocks gained for each that declined. The S&P; 500 racked up 15 new 52-week highs and 12 lows. The Nasdaq Composite posted 36 new highs and 163 lows. Some 7.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the daily average of 6.7 billion so far this month.

346,GILD,US STOCKS-Wall Street rises after China market steadies,"* Two-day Fed meeting begins * June consumer confidence falls to lowest level since Sept * Twitter, Gilead to report results after the bell * Indexes up: Dow 1.06 pct, S&P; 1.21 pct, Nasdaq 0.99 pct   (Updates to afternoon trade) By Noel Randewich July 28 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged on Tuesday and were on track to break a five-day losing streak as attention shifted from trouble in Chinese equities to U.S. corporate earnings and speculation the first Federal Reserve interest rate hike may not come until December. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P; 500 and Nasdaq Composite all logged intraday gains of 1 percent or more. With the S&P; falling over the past week toward the low end of a range it has traded in since February, some investors were betting the market was primed for a technical bounce back. “The S&P; has had five down days in a row and a lot of people are starting to nibble,” said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc in San Antonio, which manages about $1 billion. Market sentiment reflected expectations the Fed would wait until December, rather than September, to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006, Matousek said. Investors were looking for any signals from Fed Chair Janet Yellen on the timing of a rate increase when a two-day policy meeting concludes on Wednesday. No move on rates is expected this week. “September is possible but the probability for a December rate hike is increasing,” said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis. At 2:37 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.06 percent at 17,624.79. The S&P; 500 gained 1.21 percent to 2,092.62 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.99 percent to 5,089.57. It previously traded as high as 5,098. All the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors were higher, with the energy index up 3.1 percent as oil prices recovered from near six-month lows. U.S. consumer confidence weakened in July to its lowest level since September, due in part to a less optimistic outlook on the labor market. Ongoing uncertainty related to China’s stock market, which closed lower again on Tuesday, took a backseat to U.S. corporate earnings. With second-quarter reports well under way, analysts now expect overall earnings of S&P; 500 companies to edge up 0.3 percent and revenue to decline 4.0 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Big names scheduled to report on Tuesday include Twitter , Gilead and Yelp after the close. Pfizer rose 2.66 percent after the drugmaker’s quarterly profit beat expectations as vaccine sales rose. SuperValu jumped 13.99 percent. The company said it was exploring a spinoff of its discount grocery chain Save-A-Lot into a publicly traded company. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2.75 to 1. On the Nasdaq, 1.85 stocks gained for every one that declined. The S&P; 500 was posting 13 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows; the Nasdaq was recording 33 new highs and 154 new lows.

347,GILD,Gilead combo HIV pill matches Truvada efficacy but safer in trial,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc said on Wednesday its experimental fixed-dose combination treatment for HIV proved as effective in a late-stage study as the company’s widely used Truvada combo pill but with significantly less loss of bone mineral density and kidney function. The company has already sought U.S. and European marketing approval for the new combo pill nicknamed F/TAF, which is meant to be a safer replacement for Truvada, a cornerstone of HIV treatment that has been associated with slight declines in bone mineral density and kidney function. “The results of this and other recent trials demonstrate the potential of F/TAF to become a next-generation backbone” of treatment for HIV, the biotechnology company said in a release. The 48-week study was designed to assess effectiveness and safety of F/TAF among adults switching from Truvada. The combos had similar ability to drive rates of the HIV virus that causes AIDS down to undetectable levels. Overall safety was similar between the two combo pills, Gilead said, with the most common side effects being upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea and bronchitis.      Gilead said it plans to submit detailed data from the study at a scientific conference next year.  Results of the study reinforce the efficacy as well as kidney and bone safety advantages of the new combination pill, Gilead said. Gilead shares were up 0.5 percent to $101.95 in morning trading on the Nasdaq, versus a 0.7 percent gain for the Nasdaq Biotech Index (.NBI).  The Foster City, California-based company has become one of the world’s biggest and fastest-growing biotech companies thanks to its antiviral drugs, including its top-selling Sovaldi and Harvoni treatments for hepatitis C. Truvada, approved in 2004 for use with other HIV treatments, is a combination of the drugs emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, chemicals that stop reproduction of the HIV  virus. Both components are from a class of HIV treatments called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. F/TAF also contains emtricitabine. But it includes a slightly different form of tenofovir called tenofovir alafenamide meant to reach higher concentrations in HIV-infected cells but lower concentrations in blood plasma and tissues, including bones and kidneys.

350,GILD,UPDATE 2-Gilead experimental drug fights all forms of hep C: data,"(Adds details, analyst comments) By Natalie Grover Sept 21 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc is edging closer to the approval of the first drug to fight all forms of hepatitis C as the drugmaker’s experimental combination showed high rates of effectiveness in four late-stage studies. The trials were evaluating a once-daily, fixed-dose combination of the drugmaker’s approved hep C blockbuster, Sovaldi, with experimental NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir. The combination is Gilead’s second single-tablet treatment for the viral infection. Harvoni, its approved drug, targets the most common form - genotype 1 infections. The main goal of each trial testing the experimental combination was to achieve a cure 12 weeks after the completion of therapy. Of the 1,053 patients treated with the drug for 12 weeks in three trials, 98 percent were cured. Data from the fourth trial, in more advanced and weaker patients, showed higher cure rates when patients also received ribavirin, an older antiviral. Treatment-related side effects caused the death of nine patients in the trial, the company said. The combination reduces the need for genotyping and potential confusion about which regimen works in which patients, UBS AG’s Matthew Roden said. Gilead’s twin blockbuster hep C offerings, Sovaldi and Harvoni, brought in combined sales of about $4.9 billion last quarter. Harvoni is expected to remain the treatment of choice in genotype 1, given it is taken for eight weeks, JP Morgan’s Cory Casimov said. Gilead’s Sovaldi/velpatasvir combination demonstrated significant cure rates after 12 weeks. William Blair’s John Sonnier said the combination along with Gilead’s GS-9857 could decrease treatment to six weeks while maintaining pan-genotypic potency. In July, the FDA approved two new treatments for less common forms of hep C - AbbVie Inc’s Technivie for genotype 4 and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Daklinza for genotype 3. “A single, pan-genotypic approach may be particularly attractive in regions outside the United States where genotyping is less routine (or not possible),” Casimov said. The Sovaldi/velpatasvir combination bodes well for Gilead to penetrate markets outside the United States, where non-genotype 1 hep C is more prevalent, Sonnier added. The Foster City, California-based drugmaker plans to file marketing applications for the combination by the fourth quarter. The company’s stock, however, fell 2 percent after Hillary Clinton said she will propose a plan to take on specialty drug price gouging. S&P; 500 Healthcare index was down 1 pct.

354,GILD,U.S. biotech bloodbath hits hedge funds but some bargains emerge,"Sept 29 (Reuters) - A seven-day selloff of U.S. biotechnology stocks has hit sector investors - especially hedge funds - hard. But some managers say it was overdone and are already eyeing bargains such as Gilead Sciences Inc and Amgen Inc. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index has fallen 18.7 percent over the last seven sessions as investors took flight after Hillary Clinton, front-runner to be the Democratic nominee in next year’s U.S. presidential election, vowed on Sept. 21 to take steps to curb high drug prices. Since its July 20 high, the index has fallen around 27 percent. The selloff was exacerbated by general market volatility as investors have been grappling with uncertainty about when policy makers will raise U.S. interest rates and concerns over the global economy. Biotech stocks, which had risen 31 percent this year to their July high after annual increases for the last six years, were also in sellers’ sights because they had become richly valued. And the selling was intensified as investment managers did not want to issue third quarter reports showing big holdings in a beaten-down sector. “What you’re seeing is that generalist money is getting very worried and thinking that maybe the healthcare trade is over and they’re rotating into something else,” said John Fraunces, co-portfolio manager of the $137 million Turner Medical Sciences Long-Short fund in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. Health-focused hedge funds including Baker Brothers Advisors, Healthcor Management, Palo Alto Investors, and Deerfield Management are each nursing losses of more than 10 percent for September based on their publicly disclosed portfolio at the end of June, data calculated by industry tracking firm Symmetric IO show. Symetric data points to broad holdings of specialty biopharmaceutical company Horizon Pharma, which has tumbled 47.3 percent in the last 7 days and which was listed in six hedge fund portfolios. The stock was a big holding for Deerfield, which manages $7.5 billion, for Healthcor, which oversees $2.6 billion, and for Broadfin Capital, which has held the stock for nearly two years. Horizon Pharma’s losses also weighed on Iguana Healthcare Management. At the same time, a sharp drop in pharmaceutical company Valeant  weighed on a number of hedge funds, including prominent activists Pershing Square Capital Management and Jana Partners. A lot of selling took place in healthcare ETFs such as the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology EFT, which fell almost 19 percent in the last seven days with an average daily trading volume that was 1.6 times higher than its 50 day average. In the options market, most of the activity was still on the side of expecting further declines, with protective puts outweighing other biotech index trades. But some traders appear to have been snapping up call options in hopes for a sharp rebound, said Jim Smith, options strategist at OTR Global. “People who are in the sector are looking for hedges and people who are not in it are looking for bargains,” he said. Fraunces has been shorting the ETF, but now he and other investors are already eyeing bargains in the sector. He has been moving money to companies including Horizon Pharmaceuticals, one of the biggest casualties in the biotech sell-off. Some big name stocks, such as Gilead, Amgen, Biogen Inc  and Celgene Corp have sold off sharply enough to make their valuations attractive, according to several investors. Gilead’s forward valuation of 8.1 is now less than half its 10-year median of 16.7 and its competitors’ average valuations of 14.4. Amgen’s forward P/E is 12.5 compared with an average valuation of 16 for its peers. Meanwhile the S&P; 500’s forward P/E was 15.4 on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters data. “That’s pretty unusual because the absolute growth rate for those companies is two to three times higher than the S&P;,” said Sven Borho, founding general partner and fund manager at health science investment specialist Orbimed Advisors LLC, in New York. High valuations prompted Seattle-based Smead Capital Management to cut biotech and pharma holdings in its $1.2 billion Smead Value Investor fund in the last 18 months to 16.5 percent from 29 percent, Tony Scherrer, director of research said. But Scherrer, now interested in Amgen and Gilead, described the last week’s ETF trading as “throwing out the baby with the bathwater.”   (Reporting by Sinead Carew; Additional reporting by Svea Herbst, David Randall and Saqib Ahmed; Editing by Frances Kerry)",9292015,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-biotech/u-s-biotech-bloodbath-hits-hedge-funds-but-some-bargains-emerge-idUSL1N11Z26Q20150929

Genvoya, which is developed from Stribild by replacing one part of the four-drug cocktail, has already received positive opinions from European health regulators. The company’s marketing application in Europe was supported by two late-stage studies that showed the same benefit, but over 48 weeks of treatment. Stribild raked in sales of $803 million in the first half of the year, according to a regulatory filing from the company. Gilead shares were up marginally at $102 premarket.

362,GILD,U.S. FDA approves Gilead's hepatitis C drug for expanded use,"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc said on Thursday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved the expanded use of its blockbuster hepatitis C drug, Harvoni. The drug can now be used to treat patients with subtypes of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and patients who are co-infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Gilead said in a statement. The once-daily pill, used in combination with antiviral ribavirin, was also approved to be used for 12 weeks as an alternate therapy to Harvoni alone, which is used for 24 weeks to treat patients with cirrhosis. Results from the study showed that about 93 percent of the patients with subtypes of the virus and 96 percent of patients co-infected with HIV showed a sustained response to the virus within 12 weeks of treatment. Sustained viral response is the term for a successful hepatitis C treatment outcome. It means that hepatitis-C virus is undetectable for 12 or more weeks after the end of treatment. Gilead’s blockbuster Harvoni was first approved by the FDA in October 2014. The drug had sales of about $3.3 billion in the latest quarter ended Sept 30. Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure. Patients with HCV and HIV co-infection represent about 30 percent of the total HIV-infected population in the United States, Gilead says. Gilead’s shares were little changed in the after-market trading.

363,GILD,Gilead leukemia drug trial unblinded early due to success,"(Reuters) - A late stage trial of a Gilead Sciences drug in previously treated patients with a particular type of leukemia was unblinded early after independent monitors determined the medicine provided significant benefit in delaying worsening of the disease, the company said on Monday. The study was testing Gilead’s Zydelig in combination with the standard treatment, Rituxan and Treanda, compared with the standard treatment alone in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) whose disease had progressed after prior therapy. Generally, when it becomes clear that a new drug will succeed in a trial, the study is unblinded so that patients receiving other drugs or a placebo can be offered the study drug. A planned interim analysis of data from the 415-patient study by the data monitoring committee found a statistically significant benefit in progression-free survival and overall survival and ordered the trial to be unblinded, Gilead said. Details of the trial and the magnitude of benefit will be presented at a major medical meeting next month. Independent safety monitors oversee blinded trials so that they can be halted or unblinded early in case it is determined that the drug is causing harm or if the benefit becomes clear so that the medicine can be offered to placebo patients. A trial can also be stopped for futility if monitors determine the study is doomed to fail. Gilead said it plans to submit supplemental regulatory filings in the United States and Europe early next year with the hope of expanding the Zydelig approval for use with Rituxan and Treanda in previously treated CLL patients. Zydelig, known chemically as idelalisib, is already approved to treat CLL in combination with Rituxan (rituximab), and for a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in patients who have received at least two prior therapies.

365,GILD,Gilead put profit ahead of hepatitis C patients: U.S. Senate report,"(Reuters) - U.S. state Medicaid programs spent $1.3 billion before rebates in 2014 on Gilead Sciences’ new hepatitis C drugs to treat fewer than 2.4 percent of enrollees with the liver disease, according to a U.S. Senate investigation into pricing of the blockbuster medicines. In the latest salvo against high U.S. prices for important medicines, the 18-month Senate Finance Committee investigation into the cost of Gilead’s Sovaldi and follow-on combination treatment Harvoni accused the company of putting maximizing revenue ahead of patient access. The vast majority of the more than 700,000 people on state Medicaid programs for the poor with hepatitis C are still awaiting treatment, the probe found. “It was always Gilead’s plan to maximize revenue, and affordability and accessibility was an afterthought,” Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat from Oregon, said at a news conference to announce the findings along with Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley. The senators said Sovaldi and Harvoni prices did not reflect the cost of research and development or the $11 billion Gilead paid for Pharmasset to acquire the drugs, but purely a desire to maximize profit. Sovaldi was introduced at a list price of $84,000 for a course of treatment, or about $1,000 per pill, creating a furor over its cost. The Gilead drugs represent a vast improvement over prior treatments that had far lower cure rates and many troublesome side effects. While those older treatments were also expensive, they did not cause a similar burden on healthcare budgets as thousands of patients put off treatment while waiting for improved new drugs that promised a cure.  “If Gilead’s approach to pricing is the future of how blockbuster drugs are launched, it will cost billions and billions of dollars to treat just a fraction of patients,” said Wyden, the Finance Committee’s ranking member. As an example, the report said Indiana’s Medicaid program  spent $40 million to treat 462 people. In 2014 alone, Medicare and Medicaid combined to spend more than $5 billion on Sovaldi and Harvoni before rebates, the probe found. Gilead, in a statement, said it respectfully disagrees with the conclusions of the report. “With the rebates and discounts now in place, the prices today are less than the cost of prior regimens,” the company said, noting that its treatments reduce the long-term costs associated with managing chronic hepatitis C, such as by preventing liver failure or the need for transplants.   The high price of U.S. prescription medicines has become a major issue in the campaign for the November 2016 presidential election, with Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley calling for changes to limit costs to patients. “If America is to cure Alzheimer’s, cancer, diabetes and HIV in the years ahead, these cures must not be unaffordable and beyond the reach of most Americans,” Wyden said. Some newer cancer treatments cost $150,000 or more a year.

367,GILD,UPDATE 1-Belgium's Galapagos signs $2 bln deal with U.S. company Gilead,"(Adds details, share reaction, analyst comment) BRUSSELS, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Belgium’s Galapagos  has signed a deal potentially worth more than $2 billion with U.S. firm Gilead to develop a drug targeting inflammatory diseases, reviving a project abandoned by former partner AbbVie. Galapagos will receive a $725 million upfront payment for the development of experimental drug filgotinib, made up of a $300 million licence payment and a $425 million equity investment, the Belgian company said. Under the deal, Gilead will buy a 15 percent stake of Galapagos at 58 euros per share, a 20 percent premium to the average closing price over the past 30 days. On top of the upfront payment, Galapagos may receive up to $1.35 billion from Gilead if targets are met, as well as royalties once the drug enters the market. “In the hands of Gilead, filgotinib has found a strong partner,” said KBC analyst Jan De Kerpel. “The deal should also remove doubts investors had on the reason why AbbVie didn’t lift the option.” Galapagos shares rose as much as 15 percent to a record 60.55 euros early on Thursday. In September, AbbVie scrapped a development deal with Galapagos for filgotinib, a new class of medicine that blocks an inflammation-causing enzyme known as JAK1, in favour of its own project instead. Founded in 1999, Galapagos has several experimental drugs in clinical trials. Filgotinib is its most advanced candidate for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Filgotinib may start final clinical trials (Phase III) in 2016 pending regulatory approvals, Galapagos said. Belgium has become an important hub for biotech firms, partly because of its lenient tax treatment for international research staff and patents. Galapagos has other research alliances, with Morphosys  and Servier, as well as a development partnership for cystic fibrosis with AbbVie.

Stock markets plunged on Monday after weak Chinese economic data rekindled fears of a global slowdown, prompting a near-$20 billion injection by the People’s Bank of China to stabilize its markets. U.S. stocks closed sharply lower on Monday, with the Dow making its worst start to a year since 2008. Weak U.S. factory data also added to the worries. Global stocks were down on Tuesday but off the lows they hit in the previous session. “I think everybody’s finally getting settled back in and they’re trying to assess really how global growth is going to impact their investments for the rest of the year,” said Kevin Kelly, CIO of Recon Capital Partners. “You will see market volatility throughout the rest of the month, but you’ll start to see the market have a couple of up days because people are putting money to work,” he said.

379,GILD,Massachusetts challenges Gilead's hepatitis C drug prices,"(Reuters) - Massachusetts’ attorney general is studying whether the prices of Gilead Sciences Inc’s blockbuster treatments for hepatitis C violate state law, according to a letter the prosecutor sent to the California drugmaker. The letter from Attorney General Maura Healey to Gilead Chief Executive Officer John Martin, dated Jan. 22, asked the biotechnology company to reconsider its pricing for Sovaldi and Harvoni, Gilead’s treatments with list prices of $84,000 and $94,500, respectively, per course of treatment. “My office is considering whether Gilead’s pricing strategy with respect to Sovaldi and Harvoni may constitute an unfair trade practice in violation of Massachusetts law,” Healey said in the letter, a copy of which was viewed by Reuters via email. Shares of Gilead were down 2.1 percent at $90.30 on the Nasdaq on Wednesday, outpacing the 0.3 percent decline for the Nasdaq Biotech Index. Gilead has been harshly criticized by insurers, politicians and patient groups for prices of the two treatments, which can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease. The Foster City, California-based company has defended its prices, saying the drugs greatly reduce long-term costs to the healthcare system by preventing liver cancer and the need for liver transplants. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said the targeting of Gilead was more political rhetoric. “Since when is it a crime to have cured a global epidemic afflicting millions of patients, and the price is the same as the older drugs, which had less cure and bad side effects?” Yee said. Healey said as many as 3.9 million Americans are infected with the potentially fatal hepatitis C virus, which can steadily damage the liver over decades, and that fewer than 10 percent have been treated. More than 130 million people worldwide are believed to be infected. She accused Gilead of pricing the drugs “in a manner that effectively allows hepatitis C to continue spreading through vulnerable populations, as opposed to eradicating the disease altogether, (resulting) in massive public harm.” “Patients do not benefit from a drug they cannot afford,” Healey said, noting that Gilead sells Sovaldi for roughly $10 per pill in Egypt, but $1,000 per pill in the United States. The attorney general’s civil enforcement attorneys will continue to examine the potential claim for unfair commercial conduct, Healey said in her letter. Gilead officials could not immediately be reached for comment.",1272016,http://www.reuters.com/article/gilead-sciences-massachusetts/massachusetts-challenges-gileads-hepatitis-c-drug-prices-idUSL2N15B1GT

381,GILD,UPDATE 1-Payers see price leverage with entry of Merck hepatitis C drug,"(Reuters) - U.S. health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers expect the launch of Merck & Co Inc’s new hepatitis C pill to improve their leverage in price negotiations with drugmakers. The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved Merck’s Zepatier for treatment of patients infected with the most common form of the liver-destroying virus, genotype 1, as well as the less common genotype 4. The list price for the new drug is $54,600 for a 12-week regimen - compared with $94,500 for Gilead Sciences Inc’s Harvoni. A multi-pill regimen, Viekira Pak, from AbbVie Inc has a list price near $83,000. Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest manager of U.S. prescription drug plans, CVS Health Corp, the No. 2 drug benefit manager, as well as health insurers Aetna Inc and Anthem Inc told Reuters on Friday that they are evaluating the new drug in terms of medical benefit and cost. AbbVie in late 2014 secured an exclusive contract with Express Scripts, resulting in Gilead being forced to discount its own contract prices with a range of other payers. Merck said it priced Zepatier in line with net prices for competing drugs. “We look forward to working with Merck,” Express Scripts said in an emailed statement. “Having multiple, clinically effective options allows us to again leverage competition and make medicine more affordable for our clients.” No changes have been made as yet to Express Scripts’ preferred formulary, but Harvoni will be added to its Medicare formulary on March 1. CVS, which now gives preferred status to Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs, said that it is “employing a strategic assessment of the therapy landscape and engaging with drugmakers to evaluate options.” Aetna, which also lists Gilead drugs as preferred hepatitis C options, said it plans “a thorough review of Merck’s new hepatitis C drug.” Brian Skorney, an analyst at financial services firm Baird, said Merck will likely discount its price by at least 20 percent, due in part to rebates that are required by law to certain government-sponsored healthcare plans. He expected a negative market reaction “as it could indicate additional pricing pressures.” Shares of Gilead were down 5 percent at $83.00 in Friday Nasdaq trading - their lowest since June 2014. Merck shares were up 2 percent at $50.35 on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts estimate that Gilead, with $14 billion in hepatitis C drug sales for the first nine months of 2015, controls about 93 percent of the U.S. market, compared with AbbVie’s 7 percent. “Given Merck’s interest in participating in such a large market, we model and fully expect increased price competition and we also view Merck’s list price as a rational way to stay out of the drug pricing spotlight,” Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with healthcare investment bank Leerink, said in a research note. UBS has forecast that Merck will get 8 percent of the U.S.  genotype 1 market this year, rising to 15 percent in 2019. Both Zepatier and Viekira Pak require periodic liver function tests. In addition, Harvoni remains the only eight-week treatment option for genotype 1 patients.

382,GILD,Payers see price leverage with entry of Merck hepatitis C drug,"Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. pharmacy benefit managers expect the launch of Merck & Co Inc’s new hepatitis C pill to improve their leverage in price negotiations with drugmakers. The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved Merck’s Zepatier for treatment of patients infected with the most common form of the liver-destroying virus, genotype 1, as well as the less common genotype 4. The list price for the new drug is $54,600 for a 12-week regimen - compared with $94,500 for Gilead Sciences Inc’s  Harvoni. A multi-pill regimen, Viekira Pak, from AbbVie Inc has a list price near $83,000. AbbVie in late 2014 secured an exclusive contract with Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest manager of U.S.  prescription drug plans, which forced Gilead to discount its own contract prices with a range of other payers. Merck said it priced Zepatier in line with net prices for competing drugs. “We look forward to working with Merck,” Express Scripts said in an emailed statement on Friday. “Having multiple, clinically effective options allows us to again leverage competition and make medicine more affordable for our clients while ensuring appropriate patient access.” No changes have been made as yet to Express Scripts’ preferred formulary, but Harvoni will be added to its Medicare formulary on March 1. CVS Health Corp, the No. 2 drug benefit manager, which now gives preferred status to Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs, said in an email that it is “employing a strategic assessment of the therapy landscape and engaging with drugmakers to evaluate options.” Shares of Gilead were down 5 percent at $83.00 in Friday Nasdaq trading - their lowest since June 2014.

383,GILD,FDA approves Merck's new hepatitis C pill,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Thursday approved a new once-daily pill for the liver-destroying hepatitis C virus made by Merck & Co Inc, which said it will sell the drug at a lower list price than its competitors. The list price for Zepatier will be $54,600 for a 12-week regimen, which Merck said it expects “to be in the range of net prices” for comparable treatments. Gilead Sciences Inc, which secured an early lead in the lucrative market for oral hepatitis C drugs with the $1,000-per-pill Sovaldi, currently sells an enhanced version of that drug as a single-tablet regimen called Harvoni at a list price of $94,500. AbbVie Inc followed in late 2014 with a multi-pill regimen. Nevertheless, AbbVie secured exclusive contracts with payers such as pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co, forcing Gilead to discount its own contract prices. Gilead has continued to dominate the market with hepatitis C drug sales of more than $14 billion in the first nine months of 2015. The Food and Drug Administration approved Zepatier, with or without the older antiviral drug ribavirin, for patients infected with the most common form of hepatitis C, genotype 1, as well as the less common genotype 4. The new drug’s FDA label says liver-related blood tests should be performed prior to starting therapy and at certain times during treatment. Clinical trials found that 12 or 16 weeks of treatment with Merck’s Zepatier reduced the virus to undetectable levels, which is considered a cure, in more than 94 percent of patients, the FDA said in a statement.

The assessment means the pharmaceuticals industry is on track for another productive year, although not as good as 2015, which saw the arrival of 11 new blockbusters. The two top hits of 2016 are tipped to be Intercept Pharmaceuticals’ (ICPT.O) chronic liver disease drug obeticholic acid, with a consensus sales forecast of $2.6 billion in 2020, and Gilead Sciences’ (GILD.O) new fixed dose HIV drug emtricitabine plus tenofovir alafenamide, on $2.0 billion. Other products expected to launch this year with forecast sales above $1 billion in 2020 include a new hepatitis C drug from Merck (MRK.N) and a leukemia medicine from AbbVie (ABBV.N), according to the annual “Drugs to Watch” report. Two keenly awaited Roche ROG.VX drugs, each with forecast sales of around $3 billion, are not on list because it is unclear if atezolizumab for cancer and ocrelizumab for multiple sclerosis will be commercially available this year or next.

Both companies currently rely on closely related medications for the bulk of their income, creating risk, but the potential for diversification either through developing new treatments or being bought out could provide substantial upside, the publication said.  Celgene, which specializes in treatments for a blood plasma cell cancer called myeloma, could see double-digit growth for its Revlimid drug for years to come, with significant growth potential from overseas, Barron’s said.  Despite negative publicity related to high prices on its hepatitis-C drugs, Gilead Sciences’ products often cure patients within months, the publication said. “That word, cure, isn’t used often enough by Big Pharma,” Barron’s said.  The company also expects to generate $85 billion in cumulative free cash through 2020, which the publication said it could use to buy new medicines or repurchase shares.

392,GILD,UPDATE 2-Regulus hep C combo drug effective in mid-stage study,"(Reuters) - Regulus Therapeutics Inc said interim mid-stage data for its hepatitis C combination drug showed it had the potential to sharply reduce the duration of the treatment to four weeks from 12 weeks. The company’s shares recorded their best day in more than 15 months, rising as much as 41 percent to $8.85 in heavy trading on Wednesday. Regulus tested its injectable drug, RG-101, separately with FDA-approved hepatitis C drugs such as Gilead Sciences Inc’s Harvoni, Johnson & Johnson’s Olysio, and Bristol Myers Squibb’s Daklinza. Jefferies analyst Brian Abrahams said Gilead’s hepatitis C drug sales may take a hit if Regulus’s treatment turns out to be more effective in combination with drugs developed by its rivals.  Gilead, with its two blockbuster drugs Harvoni and Sovaldi, has dominated the market for hepatitis C, which affects about 185 million people worldwide. Harvoni’s total sales were $13.86 billion in 2015.  However, the company has been facing growing competition from rival treatments developed by AbbVie Inc and Merck Inc. Gilead’s shares fell 2 percent to $89.22 following Regulus’s announcement. Wedbush securities analyst Liana Moussatos said she expected Regulus’s drug to be priced either in line or less than the oral pills. Regulus enrolled 79 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus and 38 of these patients were being evaluated through eight weeks of follow up. The data showed 97 percent of these patients had a sustained reduction of the virus at eight weeks of the treatment. Analysts called Regulus’s interim data set impressive but cautioned that longer follow-up period would be needed to asses the drug’s curative potential.     Regulus said it expected to report 12-week response data in the second quarter. Most adverse events were mild to moderate though it appears there were two serious adverse events that required hospitalization, one possibly occurred after dosing, Abrahams said. Investors will be keen to know whether there will be any other adverse effects related to the treatment during the study, Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt wrote in a note. Regulus shares were up 13 percent at $7.10 on the Nasdaq on Wednesday.

Jay Fung, 42, of Delray Beach, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to conspiracy to commit securities fraud before U.S. District Judge Anne Thompson in Trenton, New Jersey. He also agreed to repay more than $760,000 of illegal profit and interest to settle related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges, that regulator said. The former broker, Kevin Dowd, pleaded guilty in September 2013 to a criminal conspiracy charge, and has also settled with the SEC. Prosecutors said Dowd tipped his friend Fung about the merger of Gilead and Pharmasset on Nov. 18, 2011, three days before it was announced, after learning about it from a Pharmasset director who was the largest customer at Dowd’s branch. Fung then illegally bought Pharmasset shares and call options, and sold them after the merger of the two makers of antiviral drugs was announced, prosecutors said. The merger valued Princeton, New Jersey-based Pharmasset at a roughly 89 percent premium over its share price at the time.     Authorities said Fung also gave Dowd kickbacks for the tip. Fung faces a maximum five years in prison at his June 20 sentencing, but is likely to get less under his plea agreement, which notes his cooperation with authorities. “It has been a long process, and Mr. Fung is happy to put this behind him,” said James Sallah, a lawyer for Fung.

400,GILD,Gilead shares look cheap but investors fret over growth,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) are trading at ultra cheap levels as investors broadly shed biotech holdings and question what the company could do for an encore after several years of torrid growth. While biotech and healthcare stocks have underperformed the broader market all year, Gilead stands out for its low forward price-to-earnings ratio, which is widely used by investors to value stocks. The stock closed at $89.53 on Thursday, having lost more than one-fourth of its value since hitting an all-time high of $123.37 in June. That put the share price at 7.3 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months. No other large U.S. pharmaceutical or biotechnology company trades below a ratio of 10.9, according to Thomson Reuters data. Gilead’s valuation in recent weeks has been the lowest since it became a solidly profitable company more than a decade ago. Over the past 10 years, the stock has traded at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 16.6 times, on average. By other metrics, the stock does not look as appealing. Using a measure of a stock’s value called a PEG ratio, which factors in Gilead’s lackluster growth outlook and its price-to-earnings ratio, the shares look at least twice as expensive as the average big biotech stock, analysts’ estimates show. “People are just skeptical about the long term earnings power of the company,” said John Fraunces, co-manager for the Turner Investments medical sciences fund in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, which does not own Gilead shares. To an extent, Gilead is a victim of its own success. The company, the largest biotech by market value at $120 billion, built upon a leading HIV medicine franchise by adding hepatitis C treatments that revolutionized care for the serious liver disease. That medical advance was reflected in its financial performance. From 2013 through last year, Gilead’s sales tripled to nearly $33 billion, while earnings shot up more than six times to $12.61 per share. But investors are concerned that Gilead’s hepatitis C franchise sales may have peaked. Earnings per share are expected to fall 3 percent this year with no growth expected through 2019, while sales are expected to recede to about $29 billion over the next four years, according to the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Gilead shares have declined 11 percent in 2016, though that is less than the 19 percent drops for big biotech peers Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) and Celgene Corp (CELG.O), while the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index .NBI has fallen 27 percent. Investors said the company’s future could rest in part on what it does with its balance sheet: Gilead amassed $26.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by the end of 2015. The company’s dividend yield sits at 1.9 percent, below the roughly 2.3 percent average for companies in the S&P; 500 Health Care index .SPXHC, while it bought back $10 billion worth of its stock last year. A major acquisition of promising companies or new medicines could help propel sales and earnings, but investors are worried about the price of buying such growth. They had also fretted over the $11 billion Gilead paid in 2011 for Pharmasset, but that deal ended up being the foundation for its hepatitis C franchise success. “What investors are worried about is, ‘Does management go out and overpay for an acquisition?’” said John Toohey, head of equities at USAA Investments in San Antonio, which owns Gilead shares. The stock is “exceptionally cheap,” Toohey said. “The (valuation) gap is so big between Gilead and other stocks, we’re willing to be patient.” ",3182016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gilead-sciences-stocks/gilead-shares-look-cheap-but-investors-fret-over-growth-idUSKCN0WK16I

From 2013 through last year, Gilead’s sales tripled to nearly $33 billion, while earnings shot up more than six times to $12.61 per share. But investors are concerned that Gilead’s hepatitis C franchise sales may have peaked. Earnings per share are expected to fall 3 percent this year with no growth expected through 2019, while sales are expected to recede to about $29 billion over the next four years, according to the average estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Gilead shares have declined 11 percent in 2016, though that is less than the 19 percent drops for big biotech peers Biogen Inc (BIIB.O) and Celgene Corp (CELG.O), while the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index .NBI has fallen 27 percent. Investors said the company’s future could rest in part on what it does with its balance sheet: Gilead amassed $26.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by the end of 2015. The company’s dividend yield sits at 1.9 percent, below the roughly 2.3 percent average for companies in the S&P; 500 Health Care index .SPXHC, while it bought back $10 billion worth of its stock last year. A major acquisition of promising companies or new medicines could help propel sales and earnings, but investors are worried about the price of buying such growth. They had also fretted over the $11 billion Gilead paid in 2011 for Pharmasset, but that deal ended up being the foundation for its hepatitis C franchise success. “What investors are worried about is, ‘Does management go out and overpay for an acquisition?’” said John Toohey, head of equities at USAA Investments in San Antonio, which owns Gilead shares. The stock is “exceptionally cheap,” Toohey said. “The (valuation) gap is so big between Gilead and other stocks, we’re willing to be patient.” ",3182016,http://www.reuters.com/article/gilead-sciences-stocks/gilead-shares-look-cheap-but-investors-fret-over-growth-idUSL2N16P1BX
402,GILD,Merck patents on Hepatitis C treatment found valid in Gilead dispute,"SAN JOSE (Reuters) - A federal jury on Tuesday upheld the validity of two Merck & Co patents in a high-profile dispute with rival Gilead Sciences Inc, which could be forced to hand over a portion of the billions of dollars in revenue from its blockbuster cure for hepatitis C. The verdict in federal court in San Jose, California, is a major setback for Gilead, whose drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni brought in $19.2 billion in worldwide sales last year. Merck has demanded more than $2 billion in damages and a royalty of 10 percent of Gilead’s sales going forward. The jury must now decide exactly how much Gilead owes. In a statement, Gilead spokeswoman Michele Rest said, “Although we are disappointed by the jury’s verdict today, there are a number of remaining issues to be decided by the jury and the judge.” Merck spokeswoman Lainie Keller said the verdict “accurately reflects the evidence in this case,” adding that strong patent protection is essential to innovation. The trial, which began on March 7, came as pharmaceutical companies race to capture a slice of the lucrative market for the newest hepatitis C treatments, which can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease. Insurers, politicians and patient groups have denounced the list prices of the drugs. Harvoni, at $1,125 per pill before discounts, costs $94,000 for a 12-week regimen. In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Merck’s Zepatier drug.

404,GILD,Merck patents on Hepatitis C treatment found valid in Gilead dispute,"SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Merck & Co told a federal jury on Tuesday it was seeking more than $2 billion in damages from rival Gilead Sciences Inc after the jury upheld the validity of two Merck patents in a high-profile dispute over Gilead’s blockbuster cure for hepatitis C. After returning its verdict in favor of Merck on Tuesday, the jury in San Jose, California immediately began hearing evidence on how much Gilead owes Merck for infringing the patents. Bruce Genderson, an attorney for Merck, said the company is seeking a 10 percent royalty on Gilead’s U.S. sales of nearly $21 billion for 2014 and 2015.  Merck has also asked for a royalty of 10 percent going forward on Gilead’s blockbuster hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, which generated $19.2 billion in worldwide sales last year.   Following the verdict, Gilead shares fell $1.92 to $91.80 in after-hours trading. Merck rose 57 cents to $53.60. In a statement, Gilead spokeswoman Michele Rest said, “Although we are disappointed by the jury’s verdict today, there are a number of remaining issues to be decided by the jury and the judge.” She declined to comment on any potential appeal. A spokeswoman for Merck said the verdict “accurately reflects the evidence in this case.”  The trial, which began on March 7, came as pharmaceutical companies race to capture a slice of the lucrative market for the newest hepatitis C treatments, which can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease.

In January, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Merck’s Zepatier drug. In 2013 Merck contacted Gilead saying the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs, sofosbuvir, infringed Merck’s patents, according to court papers.  Foster City, California-based Gilead then asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose to declare the patents invalid, saying they do not clearly describe any disease fighting effects. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, countersued for infringement.  Gilead said in court filings that Merck played no role in sofosbuvir’s discovery, but that when its breakthrough potential became clear, “Merck came knocking on Gilead’s door with its two patents in hand.”  Last month, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman ruled that the sale and use of Gilead’s drugs infringe Merck’s patents.   Michael Yee, biotech analyst for RBC Capital Markets, said “while it does not sound good that Gilead could theoretically owe billions of dollars in financial damages...it is a small amount relative to Gilead’s $127 billion market cap.”  He said he expected Gilead to appeal.

Wall Street’s fading five-week rally was further diminished  by comments over the past two days by U.S. Federal reserve officials, who indicated the possibility of more interest rate hikes than investors had anticipated. The possibility of more than the expected two rate hikes for 2016 has sent the dollar higher, pushing down commodity prices. “That has caused somewhat of a headwind for stocks,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T; Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. Gold and metals prices also fell as the dollar strengthened. U.S. Oil prices also fell more than 3 percent after data showing a rise in U.S. stockpiles last week rekindled worries about a global glut.

The damages award is far less than the $2 billion Merck had demanded. On Tuesday, the same jury in San Jose, California, upheld the validity of the patents, which lie at the heart of the dispute over Gilead’s blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni.

Merck is trying to catch up to Gilead, which dominates the market on a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure well over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease. Merck, which in January won approval on its own hepatitis C drug, Zepatier, is also asking for a 10 percent royalty on Gilead’s sales going forward. That issue will be argued in a separate non-jury trial before U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman starting next week. Gilead spokeswoman Michele Rest said the company does not believe Merck is entitled to any damages. “In the event the judge maintains the jury’s verdict, we will appeal,” she said. In a statement, Merck said, “We are pleased that the jury recognized that patent protections are essential to the development of new medical treatments.” In after-hours trading, Merck shares were down 50 cents to $52.57. Gilead shares gained slightly. Insurers, politicians and patient groups have denounced the list prices of the new drugs. Harvoni, at $1,125 per pill before discounts, costs $94,000 for a 12-week regimen. Gilead obtained the active ingredient in its drugs,   sofosbuvir, by acquiring Pharmasset, Inc in 2011. Merck said Pharmasset developed the chemical from a Merck patent that was filed in 2002. Gilead, meanwhile, said Merck’s patents were derived from Pharmasset’s work. After Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, demanded royalties in 2013, Gilead and Merck sued each other in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Last month, Freeman ruled that Gilead’s drugs infringe Merck’s patents. In calculating damages, jurors said they sought a middle ground. “We worked to get to something we could all agree so we weren’t hurting one side or the other,” juror Cody Shump, a 20-year-old San Jose resident, told Reuters.

A bench trial on Wednesday will pit Gilead’s Fish & Richardson attorneys against Merck’s lawyers from Williams & Connolly, on Gilead’s claim that Merck has “unclean hands” because it used Gilead’s technology in its own patent applications and so should be precluded from enforcing its patents.

415,GILD,Drugmakers say Japan R&D; spending at risk after government forces price cuts,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Global drugmakers said they could cut research spending in Japan due to new rules requiring them to slash prices on some blockbuster drugs, including Gilead Sciences Inc’s highly effective but expensive hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi. Drugmakers such as the Japanese arms of Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co said the change, which could as much as half the price of popular medication, risks penalizing companies for developing revolutionary drugs like Sovaldi.  “Without stability and predictability in drug prices, investments will go elsewhere,” Patrick Johnson, chief executive of Eli Lilly in Japan, recently told reporters. The comments come as the government works to attract research and development investment from pharmaceutical firms as a key part of a broader economic growth agenda. But the government also needs to curb soaring medical and nursing costs in a rapidly aging society, to help balance its primary budget by the fiscal year through March 2021. Policies focusing on medical costs rather than advanced development “raise the risk of less investment in Japan,” Pfizer’s Japan head Ichiro Umeda told Reuters. “A market that appreciates innovation allows for more investment and enables continuous development of revolutionary new drugs,” he said. Beginning April 1, the government will lower the prices drugmakers can charge for popular drugs. For instance, prices will be cut by as much as 50 percent for drugs with annual Japan sales exceeding 150 billion yen ($1.34 billion) and that are 30 percent over estimates manufacturers file with the government. For Gilead’s Sovaldi, the price will fall about 30 percent. Sovaldi has been shown to cure more than 90 percent of patients with the liver-destroying hepatitis C, without the side effects of older medicines. However, a price of $84,000 for a course of treatment in the United States drew criticism from insurers, politicians and patient groups. Gilead has since agreed to lower the price in over 90 mostly developing countries. But not in Japan, where about 1.5 million people are diagnosed with hepatitis C, and where Gilead said sales had helped push up global sales in the three months through December. When asked about Japan’s rule change, the drugmaker told Reuters it was committed to “delivering new treatments to as many patients as possible amid a changing market environment.” Others were more critical. Akira Kawahara, senior managing director of the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, told Reuters the rules were “suddenly proposed and suddenly implemented.” Drugmakers had advised the government against the move when it came up for debate late last year. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which represents U.S. biopharmaceutical firms and researchers, had said the change would penalize firms for successful drug development.

416,GILD,New AbbVie hepatitis C regimen shows high cure rates -studies,"(Reuters) - An experimental once-daily combination hepatitis C treatment being developed by AbbVie Inc demonstrated very high cure rates across a wide range of disease genotypes, according to data presented on Saturday, likely giving the company a more competitive product if approved.  Cure rates of 97 percent to 100 percent over either eight or 12 weeks of treatment were achieved in the clinical trials with the one pill, once-a-day combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530, which use different methods to block virus replication. The combination would provide greater convenience for a wider variety of patients than AbbVie’s Viekira Pak, improving  chances of making inroads into the market domination currently enjoyed by Gilead Sciences Inc. Viekira Pak, which is approved for genotype 1, the most common form of the serious liver disease in the United States, consists of four drugs and involves taking three pills in the morning and one in the evening. It currently has only about 5 percent of the market, with Gilead owning about 90 percent. Another AbbVie product treats genotype 4, which is most common in Egypt and other parts of Africa. The new one pill combination proved effective across the spectrum of genotypes 1-6 in the midstage studies presented at a European liver disease meeting in Barcelona. In patients without cirrhosis who were not helped by an older regimen, 97 percent of those with genotype 1 and 98 percent of those with genotype 2 had no detectable hepatitis C virus in the blood 12 weeks after completing eight weeks of therapy, which is considered cured. Patients with genotype 3 and no cirrhosis receiving treatment for the first time had a 97 percent cure rate with eight weeks of therapy. Cure rates of 100 percent were achieved with 12 weeks of treatment in genotype 3 patients with cirrhosis, and in non-cirrhotic patients with genotypes 4, 5 and 6. “These new data show us the potential of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in genotype 3 patients new to therapy even with the added complication of compensated cirrhosis,” Dr. Paul Kwo, one of the lead investigators and professor of medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine, said in a statement.

418,GILD,Price pressure hits Gilead first quarter U.S. hepatitis C drug sales,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc’s first quarter net profit fell 18 percent as pricing pressure resulted in lower U.S. sales of hepatitis C drug Harvoni. The biotechnology company’s shares, which fell 3.7 percent in regular trading, were down another 5.4 percent at $91.75 after hours. Gilead’s total product sales rose 4 percent to $7.7 billion. Sales of hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, the company’s second generation hepatitis treatment, totaled $4.29 billion, which was short of the $4.63 billion average Wall Street estimate, as compiled by ISI Evercore.  “The hep C numbers are a little light in the USA and that could be due to higher rebating and more competition,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. Gilead Chief Financial Officer Robin Washington said on a conference call that U.S. Harvoni sales declined due to an “increase in discounts required to open up access to patients with lower (liver) fibrosis scores,” as well as a modest shift in sales to deeply-discounted government payers, including the  Department of Veterans Affairs. Gilead drew fire more than two years ago when it launched Sovaldi, the first in a new class of hepatitis C drugs considered to be a cure for the liver-destroying disease, at a price of $84,000 per course of treatment. An estimated 3.2 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C and insurers have responded by closely monitoring which patients should be treated with the new drugs. The Foster City, California-based company has since faced competition from new hepatitis C treatments sold by other drugmakers - first AbbVie followed more recently by Merck & Co Inc. Gilead said it continues to assess business development opportunities.  “M&A; (mergers and acquisition) is always a process,” said Chief Executive Officer John Milligan, noting that Gilead has never said it would be unwilling to pursue a hostile deal, although “we do prefer a friendly process.” Adjusting for one-time items, Gilead earned $3.03 per share in the quarter, compared with the average Wall Street estimate of $3.15 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The biotechnology company’s first quarter net profit fell to $3.57 billion from $4.33 billion a year earlier. RBC’s Yee said results were also hurt by a $200 million charge for litigation with Merck.  For full-year 2016, Gilead said it still expects total product sales of $30 billion to $31 billion, in line with the average Wall Street estimate of $30.16 billion.

421,GILD,India Patent Office approves Gilead's hepatitis C drug patent,"(Reuters) - India has reversed course and granted approval to Gilead Sciences Inc’s patent for its hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, marking a setback for patient groups who said the move could stop affordable copies of the drug. The drug, which has a list price of $1,000 a pill in the United States, was rejected for a patent by the Indian patent authority in January 2015 on the basis it represented only minor changes to a previous formulation, and the company already had licensing deals with manufacturers in India. After an appeal by Gilead, the Indian Patent Office of New Delhi on Monday approved its application for the drug saying it found its compounds to be “novel” and “inventive.”  Gilead, in a statement, welcomed the move, but said it will have no impact on availability of the compound, which is already licensed to 11 generic manufacturers in India for distribution in 101 developing countries. Patents guarantee drugmakers exclusive sales for a decade or more, before generic competition is allowed, so the companies can recoup their investment and use profits to then develop new medicines. Gilead said the goal of its voluntary licensing program, and “partnership” with Indian manufacturers, is to enable access to medicines for as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. But patient groups said Gilead’s licensing deals do not serve patients and the patent approval could prevent exports of raw materials to other countries seeking to make the drug, hailed by some as a breakthrough in the global fight against hepatitis.  “Like unmerited patents, these schemes manipulate the market, violate patients’ rights and block millions of people from getting the medicines they need,” the Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge said in a statement. Gilead said eight of its licensees have launched sales in India and other licensed territories under the company’s program for supplying its hepatitis C, hepatitis B and HIV drugs to “resource-challenged countries.” Licenses have also been granted to two manufacturers in Egypt and one in Pakistan. Sovaldi was first launched in the United States in 2013 at a  list price of $28,000 for a 28-tablet bottle, or $1,000 a pill. The list price in India as of April 26, according to the Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV, was $384 per bottle, or about $14 per pill.

425,GILD,UPDATE 1-EU regulators back approval of Gilead's new hep C drug,"(Adds details, share price movement) May 27 (Reuters) - An advisory panel to the European drug regulator recommended an approval for Gilead Sciences Inc’s  new drug combination to treat hepatitis C. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use backed Gilead's combination of velpatasvir and sofosbuvir. (bit.ly/20JOyWA) Sofosbuvir is at the centre of a patent battle between Gilead and Merck & Co Inc. Gilead’s combination treatment shares an active ingredient with Sovaldi, the company’s blockbuster drug for hepatitis C. The panel on Friday also recommended granting marketing approval for Merck’s combination of elbasvir and grazoprevir to treat viral infection of the liver. Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with the liver disease. The EMA said Gilead’s new combination therapy targeted all six genotypes of the virus, while Merck’s combination drug targets only two kinds. Gilead shares were little changed in pre-market trading on the Nasdaq.

428,GILD,Gilead escapes liability in hepatitis C patent fight with Merck,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday found a pattern of misconduct by Merck & Co including lying under oath and other unethical practices, freeing Gilead Sciences Inc  from paying any damages for infringing Merck’s patents with its lucrative treatments for hepatitis C, Sovaldi and Harvoni. The dramatic ruling comes after a federal jury in San Jose, California, on March 24 ordered Gilead to pay $200 million in damages, based on findings that Merck’s patents were valid. U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead proved that in the process of applying for its patents, Merck deceptively used confidential information from Pharmasset, Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011. Freeman also said Merck cannot enforce the patents because Merck’s own lawyer gave inconsistent and untruthful testimony during the trial. “Merck’s acts are even more egregious because the main perpetrator of its misconduct was its attorney,” she said. In a statement, Merck spokeswoman Lainie Keller said Gilead’s allegations against the patents are without merit and the company would appeal. “The judge’s ruling does not reflect the facts of this case.” Gilead feels “vindicated” by the decision, spokeswoman Michele Rest said. Gilead had also been facing a demand from Merck for an ongoing royalty of at least 12 percent of all future sales of the drugs, according to court papers. Gilead made $23 billion on the two pills in the U.S. alone over the last two years. Pharmaceutical firms such as Merck, which recently launched its own hepatitis C drug, Zepatier, are trying to chip away at Gilead’s dominant position in the market for a new generation of drugs, which cure the liver disease in well over 90 percent of patients. Some policy makers and insurers have criticized their costs. Harvoni, for instance, lists at $1,125 per pill before discounts and $94,000 for a 12-week regimen. The case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming ownership of laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs. After the jury verdict, Freeman separately dealt with Foster City, California-based Gilead’s accusations of Merck’s unethical conduct in obtaining the patents. Merck, based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, countered that it had already known of the technology Gilead claimed was Pharmasset’s. Merck’s partner in the suit and co-owner of the patents, Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc, stood to receive 20 percent of any damages awarded Merck.

432,GILD,Gilead wins U.S. nod for drug for all types of hepatitis C,"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators on Tuesday approved a combination drug by Gilead Sciences Inc that is the first available treatment for all six major forms of hepatitis C, advancing the company’s leadership in the field and sending its shares up more than 4 percent. Gilead said in a separate statement that it priced the drug at $74,760 for a 12-week regimen. Gilead has dominated the hepatitis C market over rivals AbbVie and Merck & Co with its high-priced and highly effective treatments Sovaldi and the combination drug Harvoni. The new treatment, to be sold under the brand name Epclusa, combines Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), which was approved in 2013, with a new anti-viral drug velpatasvir. Epclusa costs less than the $84,000 that Sovaldi sold for when it launched in late 2013. Gilead now offers discounts and rebates on that older drug, which was at the center of a national uproar over soaring drug costs. Epclusa is approved for patients with and without cirrhosis, a form of scarring seen in patients with advanced disease that can lead to liver failure and need for a transplant. For those with moderate to severe cirrhosis, Epclusa must be taken with the older drug ribavirin, the Food and Drug Administration said. “This approval offers a management and treatment option for a wider scope of patients with chronic hepatitis C,” Edward Cox, director of the FDA’s Office of Antimicrobial Products, said in a statement. While the majority of U.S. patients have the genotype 1 form of hepatitis C, about 20 percent to 25 percent have genotypes 2 or 3, with small numbers infected with genotypes 4, 5 or 6. In other parts of the world, other genotypes are far more prevalent, such as in Egypt, where genotype 4 is widespread. In pivotal clinical trials, Epclusa led to cure rates of 95 percent to 99 percent in patients without or with mild cirrhosis after 12 weeks of treatment. In a separate trial of patients with moderate to severe cirrhosis, cure rates of 94 percent were seen. In afternoon trading, Gilead shares were up $3.35, or 4.28 percent at $81.60 on Nasdaq.

The biotechnology company’s shares, which had closed 2.3 percent higher, fell 4 percent to $85 after hours. Product sales fell to $7.65 billion from $8.13 billion in the year-ago quarter, Gilead said in a statement. Sales of hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni dropped to $4 billion from $4.9 billion. Wall Street analysts, on average, had forecast hepatitis C sales of $4.09 billion, according to a poll by ISI Evercore. Gilead lowered its 2016 product sales outlook to between $29.5 billion and $30.5 billion, from a previous range of $30 billion to $31 billion. The company said non-government U.S. health insurance plans were still limiting the number of patients who get the treatments, which many critics have said are far too expensive. Other factors behind the lower sales forecast include weaker hepatitis C drug pricing in some European markets, a trend toward shorter treatments and the loss of market share to competition, Chief Financial Officer Robin Washington told analysts on conference call after the results were released.     Gilead drew fire more than two years ago when it charged $84,000 per course of treatment for Sovaldi, the first in a new class of hepatitis C drugs considered to be a cure for the liver-destroying disease. While the list price has not changed, Gilead has offered discounts to certain insurers. Competing therapies have been launched by AbbVie Inc ABBV.O and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) over the past year. The number of U.S. patients who started undergoing treatment with hepatitis C drugs was little changed from the first quarter, suggesting that the market has stabilized, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note on Monday. Gilead’s quarterly net profit fell to $3.5 billion from $4.5 billion a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, Gilead earned $3.08 per share, which beat analysts’ average estimate of $3.02, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. An estimated 3.2 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C and insurers have responded by closely monitoring which patients should be treated with the new drugs. The virus is spread by contact with contaminated blood of an infected person, by sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs. Most patients have no symptoms, but some have fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, and yellowing of the eyes and skin.

455,GILD,UPDATE 3-Allergan to buy Tobira in push for fatty liver disease drugs,"(Reuters) - Botox maker Allergan Plc, in its third acquisition this month, said it would pay up to $1.7 billion for Tobira Therapeutics Inc to get a leg up in the race to develop therapies for NASH, an incurable fatty liver disease closely linked to obesity. Just hours later on Tuesday, Allergan announced it would also pay $50 million upfront and make future milestone payments for Akarna Therapeutics Ltd, a privately held company that is planning early-stage studies of a treatment for NASH. There are no approved treatments for the disease affecting more than 15 million Americans, which involves accumulation of fat in the liver not caused by alcohol, and can lead to cirrhosis, liver transplants or liver cancer. “Allergan is making an excellent move into the NASH space, which is under appreciated by Wall Street and one of the major categories of untreated diseases,” said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of StocDoc Partners who holds shares of Tobira. Allergan’s offer on Tuesday of $28.35 upfront per Tobira share is a whopping 500 percent premium to the stock’s close on Monday, which had given Tobira a market capitalization of about $89 million. Tobira shareholders could receive up to $49.84 per share, contingent on the company achieving certain milestones. Tobira’s stock surged 720 percent to $38.91 on Tuesday. But Allergan’s fell 2.7 percent to $238.67 as some industry analysts said the deal came at a steep price. Tobira shares have been on a roller coaster ride since July 25, when they tumbled 60 percent to $4.50 after the company’s lead product, cenicriviroc, failed its main goal in a mid-stage trial of showing a 2-point reduction on a scale that measures features of NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis).     But cenicriviroc achieved a secondary goal by reducing by at least one stage the extent of fibrosis, a scarring of the liver that can lead to cirrhosis, without worsening of NASH. Tobira said the drug has potential to be approved if that favorable secondary finding can be duplicated in a larger late-stage study. Yaffe said cenicriviroc and related therapies being developed by the company have potential to reap annual sales of $5 billion. He said experimental NASH drugs being developed by Gilead Sciences Inc have similar sales potential and that treatments being studied by Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc and others also have blockbuster sales potential. Allergan research chief David Nicholson, in an interview, said liver biopsies are now required to confirm NASH, but  less-invasive diagnostic tests should be available by the time the first NASH treatments reach the market, or soon after. “The science in NASH is breaking now and this could become one of Allergan’s largest categories” of medicines, Nicholson said.  The proposed acquisition is the latest in a string of deals orchestrated by Brent Saunders, Allergan’s chief executive, since the company’s planned $160 billion merger with Pfizer Inc collapsed in April because of unfavorable new U.S. tax regulations. Allergan, best known for its Botox anti-wrinkle treatment,  last week said it would pay $639 million for Vitae Pharmaceuticals, which is developing drugs for psoriasis, eczema and autoimmune disorders. It agreed on Sept. 6 to pay $60 million for RetroSense, a privately held company developing an ophthalmology gene therapy.  Other major contenders in the race to develop a drug to treat NASH include Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc, whose shares rose 19.4 percent, and Galectin Therapeutics Inc, whose stock gained 14.8 percent. Covington & Burling are Allergan’s lead legal counsel.  Centerview Partners and Citi are Tobira’s financial advisers, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian LLP are its legal counsel.

Shares of Gilead, which closed at $74.07 on the Nasdaq exchange, were slightly lower at $73.69 in after-hours trading. Quarterly net profits dropped to $3.3 billion from $4.6 billion a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, Gilead said it earned $2.75 per share, compared with an average analyst estimate of $2.86, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total product sales fell to $7.4 billion from $8.2 billion in the same 2015 period. Sales of hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi, Harvoni and recently launched Epclusa totaled $3.3 billion, compared with $4.8 billion a year earlier for Sovaldi and Harvoni. Wall Street analysts, on average, had forecast hepatitis C drug sales of $3.74 billion, according to a poll by Evercore ISI. Sales of HIV and other antiviral drugs rose 21 percent from the year-ago period to $3.5 billion, due to robust sales of a new generation of Gilead medications, growing use of Gilead’s older drug Truvada to prevent HIV infection and a one-time $332 million adjustment to the company’s rebate reserve. HIV sales were mixed, especially once one-time rebates are excluded, Jefferies analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note. But he noted that the results “should bode well for HIV franchise sustainability.” Gilead drew fire after its 2014 launch of Sovaldi, the first in a new class of hepatitis C drugs considered to be a cure for the liver-destroying disease, at a price of $1,000 per pill. An estimated 3.2 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C and insurers have responded by closely monitoring which patients should be treated. Health insurers and other payers have also been able to command steep discounts from Gilead now that competing hepatitis C drugs have been launched by AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N).

464,GILD,J&J; vaccine plus Gilead immune booster shows promise as HIV fighter,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - An experimental HIV vaccine from Johnson & Johnson combined with an immune system booster from Gilead Sciences Inc showed promise at keeping the virus at bay in monkeys even after treatments had stopped, marking yet another step toward the development of a so-called functional cure for HIV. Both companies are currently testing the products separately in early-stage trials in people with HIV. The study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, evaluated monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus, the monkey version of HIV, and showed the treatments were much more effective when used together than separately. All nine monkeys that got both treatments showed significantly reduced viral loads. In three of them, the combination therapy has kept the virus at bay for six months after antiretroviral therapy or ART drugs were stopped. The study is part of ongoing efforts to develop a so-called functional cure for HIV that would allow people infected with the virus to stop taking daily antiretroviral therapy. [L1N1CJ134] “Current antiretroviral drugs, although they’re lifesaving, do not cure HIV. They merely hold it in check. We are trying to develop strategies to achieve ART-free, long-term viral suppression,” said study author Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. For the study, the team used what is known as a “kick and kill” approach. The two-punch strategy is designed to lure dormant HIV-infected immune cells out of hiding places in the body and then attempt to eradicate them. The trial evaluated a therapeutic vaccine called Ad26/MVA, which J&J; and partners are testing in early-stage human trials. The vaccine works by provoking a broad immune response from the adaptive immune system, the part that recognizes specific pathogens and produces lasting immunity. They combined this with Gilead’s experimental drug called GS-986, a so-called TLR-7 agonist that kickstarts the innate immune system, a more generalized line of defense that mounts the body’s initial response to infection. Gilead is also testing this in trials of HIV-infected patients. In the study, they evaluated 36 monkeys infected with SIV that had been treated with ART for six months to get the virus under control. They then divided the group into four arms, with one getting the Ad26/MVA vaccine alone, another getting the TLR-7 agonist alone, a third getting the combination of the two, and a fourth getting a placebo. Then, they discontinued ART in all of the animals and monitored levels of the virus in their blood and lymph nodes. Animals that got Gilead’s TLR-7 agonist saw no benefit and the virus quickly rebounded. Those that got the vaccine alone showed some reduction of viral load and a modest delay in viral rebound. The biggest effect was in the combination group, which saw a 2.5 times longer delay in viral rebound compared to the control group. In this group, levels of virus in the blood were 50 times lower than in the controls, and the virus fell to undetectable levels in three of the animals, which have been off ART for six months with no viral rebound. “If all the animals’ viral loads had been undetectable, that would have been a home run,” said Barouch. “But the fact that all animals showed a reduction in viral load and three out of nine were undetectable, that’s a solid base hit. It’s definitely something that we can work from.” Barouch said his team has been in talks with both companies to test the combination therapy in patients with HIV.

The vaccine works by provoking a broad immune response from the adaptive immune system, the part that recognizes specific pathogens and produces lasting immunity. They combined this with Gilead’s experimental drug called GS-986, a so-called TLR-7 agonist that kickstarts the innate immune system, a more generalized line of defense that mounts the body’s initial response to infection. Gilead is also testing this in trials of HIV-infected patients. In the study, they evaluated 36 monkeys infected with SIV that had been treated with ART for six months to get the virus under control. They then divided the group into four arms, with one getting the Ad26/MVA vaccine alone, another getting the TLR-7 agonist alone, a third getting the combination of the two, and a fourth getting a placebo. Then, they discontinued ART in all of the animals and monitored levels of the virus in their blood and lymph nodes. Animals that got Gilead’s TLR-7 agonist saw no benefit and the virus quickly rebounded. Those that got the vaccine alone showed some reduction of viral load and a modest delay in viral rebound. The biggest effect was in the combination group, which saw a 2.5 times longer delay in viral rebound compared to the control group. In this group, levels of virus in the blood were 50 times lower than in the controls, and the virus fell to undetectable levels in three of the animals, which have been off ART for six months with no viral rebound. “If all the animals’ viral loads had been undetectable, that would have been a home run,” said Barouch. “But the fact that all animals showed a reduction in viral load and three out of nine were undetectable, that’s a solid base hit. It’s definitely something that we can work from.” Barouch said his team has been in talks with both companies to test the combination therapy in patients with HIV.

The drug, Vemlidy, comes with a boxed warning, the strongest warning issued by the FDA that highlights serious risks such as lactic acid buildup, accumulation of fat on the liver or aggravation of the infection. The drug has been approved as a once-daily treatment for the condition, which the World Health Organization estimates is responsible for more than 686,000 deaths every year worldwide. Data from a late-stage study showed in January that the drug was not only effective, but also safer than the company’s approved treatment, Viread.

472,GILD,"Switching course, Gilead markets HIV drug for prevention","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc has begun marketing its HIV treatment Truvada in a way thousands of consumers already use it – to prevent infection with the virus that causes AIDS. The company introduced Truvada to the U.S. market in 2004 for HIV treatment. In 2012, Gilead won approval to market it for prevention after two large, peer-reviewed studies showed it also was effective at preventing infections in healthy people.  But the company decided against promoting the drug as a preventative treatment, deferring to patient advocates who feared it could encourage promiscuity and unsafe practices, such as having sex without condoms. Even without Gilead’s help, many consumers learned Truvada was more than 90 percent effective in tests at preventing HIV infection. In 2014, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended it as an option for people at high risk for HIV infection. As many as 90,000 people in the United States used the drug for prevention, or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), last quarter. That’s up from 60,000 to 70,000 earlier this year, the company said. Usage also is growing in France, where about 2,000 people have been prescribed Truvada for prevention since January. In July, the drugmaker began marketing Truvada for PrEP to doctors through professional publications, digital advertising and other channels, including the website PreventHIV.com. And this fall, the drugmaker began marketing directly to consumers with print advertisements in publications geared toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, including OUT, Advocate and SWERV. It plans soon to expand to social media and digital. Gilead said it wants to reach people whose doctors are either unaware or reluctant to prescribe Truvada for prevention.  The marketing “is primarily driven by demand by patients,” said David Piontkowsky, Gilead’s vice president of HIV Medical Affairs, in an interview.  Attitudes toward Truvada started to change a couple years ago as doctors, AIDS activists and potential users saw its effectiveness, he said. The “criticism now is we’re not saying enough.” Truvada is helping bolster Gilead’s profits as sales of its biggest moneymakers – treatments for hepatitis C – decline. U.S. net product sales of Truvada for the first nine months of 2016 were $1.8 billion compared with $1.5 billion for the same period in 2015. The company said in its earnings report that the gain was driven by price increases as well as “increased usage of Truvada for PrEP.” “We expect PrEP to continue to be a significant part of Gilead’s growth in HIV going forward, particularly in the U.S.,” Gilead Chief Operating Officer Kevin Young recently told investors. The new Truvada campaign has been well received, even by those who once opposed promoting the drug for prevention. They include David Duran, a writer and HIV advocate, who helped popularize the term “Truvada Whore” in a 2012 article describing his fear that it would encourage people to have sex without condoms.  Duran began rethinking that concern about a year later in light of newer research showing that PrEP helped prevent more cases of HIV, without a rise in other sexually transmitted disease, which suggested people were using condoms. “I’m thrilled they are starting to pump some money into marketing and awareness,” Duran said. “There is a solid base of folks who know about PrEP, but it’s still not a topic the country as a whole knows about.” As a preventive measure, the blue Truvada pill is taken once daily. Some people experience nausea, vomiting or headaches during the first few weeks on the drug.  Users must be tested every three months to ensure they don’t have HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases and to monitor kidney function and bone density. Some Medicaid programs and most private insurance cover the treatment, which lists for $1,500 a month before any negotiated discounts. With greater awareness and favorable coverage for preventative treatments, the number of Americans using Truvada could rise, said the company and healthcare providers.  An estimated 50,000 new U.S. HIV infections are diagnosed each year. The CDC estimated in 2015 that about 1.2 million Americans were at substantial risk of HIV infection and could benefit from PrEP.   That includes men who have sex with men, transgender women who have sex with men, partners of people who are HIV-positive and intravenous drug users who share needles. The number of high risk groups “is much broader than one might think,” said Dr. Jennifer Childs-Roshak, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts. “It is not just men with multiple partners. There are a whole host of folks who could benefit.” At least 15 patients have gone on Truvada for prevention since Planned Parenthood’s six Massachusetts clinics began offering it this fall. Planned Parenthood of New York City plans to offer the treatment to all of its 50,000 patients, said Julia Sullivan, associate director of quality management.  Wider use also could buffer Gilead when Truvada, the only drug currently approved in the United States for PrEP, loses patent protection in 2021. Gilead has a successor treatment in the works. The once-daily F/TAF (emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide) has been approved for HIV treatment and is under study as a preventative. “PrEP is indeed a significant part of Truvada,” said Leerink Partners analyst Geoffrey Porges. “It can certainly keep Truvada relatively flat but the key question is, when will they show that TAF works for PrEP?” In the meantime, the concept of taking an HIV drug to prevent infection is making inroads in popular U.S. culture. It came up in an episode of “Transparent,” the Emmy award-winning Amazon series about a family with a transgender parent, when a character was contemplating sex with an HIV-positive partner. “We were trying to make the conversation reflect what happens in real life,” said a writer on the show who works under the name Our Lady J. “PrEP is a big part of that conversation. As an HIV positive person, I’m struck with the level of ignorance around PrEP.” ",11302016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aids-day-truvada/switching-course-gilead-markets-hiv-drug-for-prevention-idUSKBN13P0EG
473,GILD,Merck wins $2.54 billion in hepatitis C drug trial against Gilead,"(Reuters) - Merck & Co on Thursday was awarded $2.54 billion in royalties by a federal jury in a patent lawsuit against Gilead Sciences Inc over Gilead’s blockbuster hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. The jury in Delaware reached the verdict following a nearly two-week trial, finding that a patent acquired by Merck in 2014 on hepatitis C treatments was valid. “The jury’s verdict upholds patent protections that are essential to the development of new medical treatments,” Merck said in a statement Thursday. Gilead spokeswoman Michele Rest said the company disagreed with the verdict and would appeal it. She said it did not stop Gilead from continuing to sell its drugs. Merck’s stock rose slightly to $63 in late trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Gilead’s shares fell 2 percent to $74.06 on the Nasdaq. Harvoni and Sovaldi have drawn attention for their breakthrough success in curing hepatitis C in more than 90 percent of patients, and for their high cost. Harvoni’s list price is $1,125 per pill and $94,500 for a 12-week regimen. Foster City, California-based Gilead, one of the world’s largest biotechnology companies, made nearly $20 billion on the two drugs in 2015. The jury’s award was based on a 10 percent royalty rate from the sales of both drugs through August.  The patent upheld by the jury was originally issued to Idenix Pharmaceuticals, a company Merck bought in 2014. Idenix brought the patent lawsuit against Gilead in 2013 in an effort to block the launch of Sovaldi, which was approved by federal regulators in December of that year. Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi’s active ingredient, sofosbuvir, with another drug, was approved in October 2014. Merck, which sells its own hepatitis C drug, Zepatier, previously won a $200 million jury verdict in March in a separate patent infringement case against Gilead over hepatitis C drugs. But in June, a federal judge in San Jose, California overturned the verdict after finding that Merck engaged in a pattern of unethical conduct, including lying under oath. Merck is currently appealing that ruling. ",12152016,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-gilead-sciences-merck-co-verdict/merck-wins-2-54-billion-in-hepatitis-c-drug-trial-against-gilead-idUSKBN1442U9

482,GILD,"UPDATE 3-Gilead 2017 hepatitis C sales forecast disappoints, shares drop","(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) on Tuesday projected disappointing sales for its hepatitis C drugs this year because of fewer patients being started on treatments and more competition, sending its shares down more than 5 percent after hours. The company forecast 2017 hepatitis C drug sales of $7.5 billion to $9 billion, much lower than the $12 billion Wall Street had expected. “The 2017 guidance was $4-$5 billion lower than buyside expectations,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, adding that the sales outlook implies 2017 earnings for Gilead of $6.60-$9.00 per share, which is well below the average analyst estimate of $10.71 per share. Gilead said around 231,000 U.S. patients were started on its hepatitis C drugs last year, but that will fall to around 160,000 in 2017 because of a combination of factors including a greater number of patients with less advanced disease and more patients with issues that favor delaying treatment, including alcohol dependency and unstable lifestyle. A similar trend is expected in Europe and Japan. “This market has been full of surprises,” Gilead Chief Operating Officer Kevin Young said on a conference call. “It surprised us on the way up, and it is surprising us in some ways with the dynamics coming down.” Chief Executive Officer John Milligan acknowledged that the company has few prospects for new products over the next few years. “It makes it challenging for us to grow without an acquisition,” he said. Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure. Direct-acting anti-virals, such as Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni, have revolutionized treatment, with cure rates of more than 90 percent shown in clinical trials. But there was a backlash from health insurers and other payers when Gilead launched Sovaldi three years ago at a price of $84,000, or $1,000 per pill. The company said Tuesday that its 2016 average net price for Harvoni was $15,000 per bottle of 28 pills, after discounts and rebates, compared with a $31,5000 list price. For Medicaid, the U.S. government program covering the poor and disabled, Gilead said its average price per bottle was less than $10,000. Continued price pressure is expected as companies including AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) launch new hepatitis C drugs. For its other products, including HIV drugs, Gilead forecast 2017 sales of $15 billion to $15.5 billion, bringing its expected overall 2017 product sales to between $22.5 billion and $24.5 billion, compared with $30 billion in 2016. Shares of the Foster City, California-based company were down more than 5 percent at $69.19 in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq. Fourth-quarter net income fell to $3.1 billion from $4.7 billion a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, Gilead said it earned $2.70 a share in the quarter, compared with $3.32 a share a year earlier.

486,GILD,GlaxoSmithKline and Gilead to face off at HIV meeting next week,"LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline and Gilead Sciences will vie for business in treating HIV patients next week when both companies unveil clinical trial results at a medical meeting in Seattle. Most attention is focused on Gilead’s next-generation drug bictegravir, a so-called integrase inhibitor similar to GSK’s successful dolutegravir that may offer advantages in terms of greater potency and reduced side effects. GSK plans to defend its patch by highlighting the potential of a new two-drug treatment regimen for controlling the virus behind AIDS, a development that marks a departure from conventional triple drug cocktails. As dolutegravir has been the mainstay of GSK’s HIV business in recent years, investors are nervous about the threat posed by Gilead’s competitor, even though next week’s bictegravir data is only from mid-stage Phase II testing. The drug is also in final stage Phase III testing.

487,GILD,Gilead shares slump after gloomy sales forecast for hep C drugs,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc’s (GILD.O) shares fell as much as 10 percent on Wednesday, after the drugmaker forecast bleak sales for its hepatitis C drugs this year, underscoring the need for the company to strengthen its pipeline through acquisitions. Sales of the drugs, including Sovaldi and Harvoni, have slowed, missing Wall Street estimates in the past few quarters, but still account for nearly half of Gilead’s total revenue. Chief Executive John Milligan acknowledged on Tuesday that the company had few prospects for new products over the next few years. “It makes it challenging for us to grow without an acquisition,” Milligan said. Several analysts said Milligan’s stance reflected a change in the company’s M&A; strategy. “We continue to see M&A; as the primary catalyst though the level of urgency for deals is under-recognized,” Barclays analysts said. Gilead is one of the few large drugmakers to have eschewed splurging on multi-billion dollar deals in the recent past even as M&A; activity in the healthcare sector hit record levels. The company had $32.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of Dec. 31. At least 2 brokerages downgraded their ratings on the stock on Wednesday, while 10 cut their price targets. “Management desperately needs to identify candidates for Gilead’s pipeline capable of changing the conversation among investors from ‘How bad will it get?’ to ‘How good could it be?’,” Cowen analysts said. Gilead forecast 2017 hepatitis C drug sales of $7.5 billion-$9 billion, much lower than the $12 billion Wall Street analysts had expected, due to fewer patients starting on treatments and increased competition. Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure. Sovaldi and Harvoni revolutionized treatment of the disease, helping triple the company’s sales to nearly $33 billion in 2015 from 2013. Despite the recent slowdown in sales of hep C drugs, analysts remain largely bullish on the stock. Seventeen of 29 analysts rate the stock “buy” or higher and rest have “hold” ratings, according to Thomson Reuters data. Gilead's shares were down 9.5 percent at $66.18 on Wednesday, after hitting a near three-year low of $65.75. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P; 500 Index .SPX. “We are still of the view that Gilead can buy growth or an impactful pipeline or both, but investor patience seems to be wearing thin,” Barclays analysts said.

489,GILD,GlaxoSmithKline and Gilead to face off at HIV meeting next week,"LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline and Gilead Sciences will vie for business in treating HIV patients next week when both companies unveil clinical trial results at a medical meeting in Seattle. Most attention is focused on Gilead’s next-generation drug bictegravir, a so-called integrase inhibitor similar to GSK’s successful dolutegravir that may offer advantages in terms of greater potency and reduced side effects. GSK plans to defend its patch by highlighting the potential of a new two-drug treatment regimen for controlling the virus behind AIDS, a development that marks a departure from conventional triple drug cocktails. As dolutegravir has been the mainstay of GSK’s HIV business in recent years, investors are nervous about the threat posed by Gilead’s competitor, even though next week’s bictegravir data is only from mid-stage Phase II testing. The drug is also in final stage Phase III testing. GSK Chief Executive Andrew Witty said dolutegravir’s key attribute was its proven track record in avoiding the HIV virus’s potential to develop drug resistance. He described other issues as “peripheral”. “It has an extremely impressive resistance profile,” Witty told analysts after reporting fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.  “It is not easy to beat ... in terms of the thing that really matters, I think that dolutegravir remains an extremely impressive molecule.” Results of Gilead’s Phase II trial comparing bictegravir with dolutegravir when both drugs are used as part of a drug-drug combination will be presented at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Seattle on Feb. 13.

492,GILD,"Gilead 2017 hepatitis C sales forecast disappoints, shares drop","(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) on Tuesday projected disappointing sales for its hepatitis C drugs this year because of fewer patients being started on treatments and more competition, sending its shares down more than 5 percent after hours. The company forecast 2017 hepatitis C drug sales of $7.5 billion to $9 billion, much lower than the $12 billion Wall Street had expected. “The 2017 guidance was $4-$5 billion lower than buyside expectations,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, adding that the sales outlook implies 2017 earnings for Gilead of $6.60-$9.00 per share, which is well below the average analyst estimate of $10.71 per share. Gilead said around 231,000 U.S. patients were started on its hepatitis C drugs last year, but that will fall to around 160,000 in 2017 because of a combination of factors including a greater number of patients with less advanced disease and more patients with issues that favor delaying treatment, including alcohol dependency and unstable lifestyle. A similar trend is expected in Europe and Japan. “This market has been full of surprises,” Gilead Chief Operating Officer Kevin Young said on a conference call. “It surprised us on the way up, and it is surprising us in some ways with the dynamics coming down.” Chief Executive Officer John Milligan acknowledged that the company has few prospects for new products over the next few years. “It makes it challenging for us to grow without an acquisition,” he said. Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure. Direct-acting anti-virals, such as Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni, have revolutionized treatment, with cure rates of more than 90 percent shown in clinical trials. But there was a backlash from health insurers and other payers when Gilead launched Sovaldi three years ago at a price of $84,000, or $1,000 per pill. The company said Tuesday that its 2016 average net price for Harvoni was $15,000 per bottle of 28 pills, after discounts and rebates, compared with a $31,5000 list price. For Medicaid, the U.S. government program covering the poor and disabled, Gilead said its average price per bottle was less than $10,000. Continued price pressure is expected as companies including AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) launch new hepatitis C drugs. For its other products, including HIV drugs, Gilead forecast 2017 sales of $15 billion to $15.5 billion, bringing its expected overall 2017 product sales to between $22.5 billion and $24.5 billion, compared with $30 billion in 2016. Shares of the Foster City, California-based company were down more than 5 percent at $69.19 in after-hours trading on the Nasdaq. Fourth-quarter net income fell to $3.1 billion from $4.7 billion a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, Gilead said it earned $2.70 a share in the quarter, compared with $3.32 a share a year earlier. Quarterly sales of hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa totaled $3.2 billion, down from $4.9 billion.

Gilead’s bictegravir, another so-called integrase inhibitor drug, delivered 97 percent virus suppression, making it just as effective as GSK’s product, data presented at a medical meeting in Seattle late on Monday showed. Importantly, there were no cases of resistance emerging to the new medicine in the 98-patient Phase II study and no patients discontinued treatment due to kidney problems, which can be an issue with HIV treatments. Potential drug resistance is a key consideration for the new drug because dolutegravir is valued by doctors for its excellent resistance profile. Berenberg analyst Laura Sutcliffe said the results were good news for Gilead but the data was not yet conclusive, since findings from larger Phase III tests are due later in the year. Gilead is pinning its hopes on bictegravir to stay competitive with GSK and the U.S. company has been testing the new medicine alongside two older drugs.

Sofosbuvir is sold by the U.S. drugmaker as Sovaldi and is included in other hepatitis C medicines such as Harvoni and Epclusa. The treatment is transforming the fight against the liver-destroying viral disease by offering an effective cure, but Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) and Medecins du Monde (MdM) said its high cost was a serious barrier. The campaigners argue that the patent on the drug, which costs tens of thousands of dollars for a typical course, is open to challenge because the science behind sofosbuvir is not new.

If the latest patent challenge is successful, it could make cheaper generic versions of sofosbuvir available in Europe.

509,GILD,UPDATE 1-NASH: The next untapped pharma market gives investors many options,"(Reuters) - Large drugmakers with piles of cash are on the hunt for promising medicines being developed by small companies to treat NASH, a progressive fatty liver disease poised to become the leading cause of liver transplants by 2020.  The eventual market for the complex disease, formally known as Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis, is forecast to be $20 billion to $35 billion as populations with fatty diets increasingly fall victim to a condition with no approved treatments.  With intense competition and pricing pressure eroding sales of medicines for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and other lucrative disease categories, and an already crowded field for developmental cancer drugs, big pharma sees NASH as an enormous new market for future profit that will accelerate a wave of deal making.  “We are actively looking on the outside for opportunities... to complement our internal program,” Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer for internal medicine for Pfizer (PFE.N), told Reuters.  Pfizer currently has three early-stage drugs in the clinic aiming to block or reverse fat accumulation in the liver. “We believe that even though we’re a bit behind, we still might come out with the best-in-class molecules,” Birnbaum said.  Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) also confirmed it is looking for additional assets to enhance its internally-developed NASH drugs. It presented promising data for its lead NASH candidate at the big European liver meeting in Amsterdam that ended on Sunday.  “It’s early days, but keep your seatbelts fastened,” said Dr. Scott Friedman, dean for therapeutic discovery at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York and one of the world’s leading liver disease experts.  Estimates for the prevalence of NASH in nations with fatty diets range from 5 to 20 percent of the population with up to 15 million potentially affected in the United States alone.  Driven by the obesity and diabetes epidemics, the disease guarantees an enormous pool of patients for decades, making it a prime target for deals for promising therapies for NASH and its consequences - advanced fibrosis and liver-destroying cirrhosis. The very early stages of many of the drugs, and the complicated nature of the disease itself, pose risks for drug developers and their investors alike.  But the upside potential is still enticing to Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director and senior healthcare analyst at Rodman and Renshaw. He calls NASH one of the hottest spaces in the healthcare sector.  ""We anticipate that there will be more transactions, more licensing deals from big pharma involving emerging biotechnology companies,"" he said.  Just a few years ago, Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) was the lone large drugmaker talking about NASH. It was undeterred after its most advanced anti-fibrosis candidate failed, striking deals with two small companies to acquire additional NASH programs.  Liver disease experts were impressed last year by Phase II data from a Gilead-developed drug that demonstrated fibrosis regression after just six months.  Allergan (AGN.N) became a top NASH contender with its acquisition of Tobira Therapeutics and a deal with private Akarna Therapeutics on the same day last year.  Other big drugmakers with licensing deals or options on future deals in the space include Novartis (NOVN.S), Merck & Co (MRK.N), Bristol-Myers and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N).  While many of the drugs in development are two-to-five years from reaching the market if they get that far, betting on the feverish deal activity gives investors a chance to profit near term.  Many small companies developing drugs with a wide variety of approaches across the disease spectrum do not have partners. They include Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT.O), Galectin Therapeutics (GALT.O), Genfit (GNFT.PA) and Galmed Pharmaceuticals (GLMD.O), all with a chance to be among the first to market, as well as Enanta Pharmaceuticals(ENTA.O), Durect Corp (DRRX.O) and little-known U.K.-tradedTiziana Life Sciences (TILST.L) with assets much earlier indevelopment.  Galectin, which expects key data in December, has commenced preliminary partnership discussions, its chief operating officer told Reuters.  Len Yaffe, who runs the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund and has long followed the liver disease space, said investors with tolerance for risk could do well to buy shares in several small-cap and micro-cap companies with promising NASH drugs in early development. He said if any one has stellar data, or lands a deal, the payoff could be considerable.  When Allergan announced the $1.7 billion deal for Tobira, for example, that company’s shares jumped from under $5 to over $30.  Yaffe, who had singled out Tobira to investors prior to its acquisition, said the Durect drug “looks incredibly promising as it relates to inflammation and fibrosis.”  Enanta has the advantage of cash flow from its hepatitis C partnership with AbbVie (ABBV.N) to fund its NASH program.  “You want to bet on companies that can survive even if they don’t get a partnership this year or next year,” Selvaraju said.  Enanta Chief Executive Jay Luly said companies in earlier stages of development may have an advantage over the first wave of experimental treatments as regulators’ thinking on clinical trial goals and what makes an approvable product in such a new market evolves.  “When we get there, the development pathway could be not only more clearly defined, but more simplified,” Luly said.  Drugmakers are taking a wide range of approaches to treat the complex disease, given multiple health issues among NASH patients that contribute to the liver damage, such as heart disease and diabetes.  There are drugs targeting inflammation to prevent or reduce fibrotic scarring. Some address lipid regulation to reduce liver fat, while others attempt to directly halt or reverse fibrosis. And some companies are testing diabetes treatments to assess their ability to also improve NASH.  “The big sea change from two years ago - apart from an increased number of players - is a fairly rapid acceptance of the fact that we’re going to be seeking combination therapies since it’s a disease that involves multiple pathways,” said Mt. Sinai’s Friedman.  “In the end, whatever the mechanism is, it needs to yield decreased fibrosis,” he said, noting that progressing fibrosis is what ultimately causes serious health consequences.  The knowledge that multiple drugs will be needed for therapeutic combinations to treat NASH, and that most experimental drugs fail, are big drivers for deal activity. Drugmakers are looking to improve chances of success by amassing numerous experimental drugs for their NASH programs. Some experts said drugs that target late-stage fibrosis and cirrhosis, where the risk of cancer and liver failure is highest, are likely to gain earliest acceptance from insurers.  That fits the strategy of tiny Conatus Pharmaceuticals (CNAT.O), whose shares more than doubled when it signed a $50 million collaboration deal with Novartis. Conatus is targeting end-stage disease with the goal of preventing transplants.  But given the millions of potential patients and expense of treating advanced disease, there should be incentive for insurers to embrace medicines that target earlier stage NASH as well.  “There’s still a major role for drugs that work on the front end,” said Dr. Arun Sanyal, a leading liver disease expert whose Virginia Commonwealth University lab discovered the compound being developed by Durect. “One size will not fit all.”  ",4242017,http://www.reuters.com/article/health-liver-nash/update-1-nash-the-next-untapped-pharma-market-gives-investors-many-options-idUSL1N1HW0ZO

The eventual market for the complex disease, formally known as Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis, is forecast to be $20 billion to $35 billion as populations with fatty diets increasingly fall victim to a condition with no approved treatments. With intense competition and pricing pressure eroding sales of medicines for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and other lucrative disease categories, and an already crowded field for developmental cancer drugs, big pharma sees NASH as an enormous new market for future profit that will accelerate a wave of deal making. “We are actively looking on the outside for opportunities... to complement our internal program,” Morris Birnbaum, chief scientific officer for internal medicine for Pfizer, told Reuters. Pfizer currently has three early-stage drugs in the clinic aiming to block or reverse fat accumulation in the liver. “We believe that even though we’re a bit behind, we still might come out with the best-in-class molecules,” Birnbaum said.

512,GILD,"Gilead profit falls as hepatitis C sales drop, shares down","(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) on Tuesday reported a 25 percent drop in first-quarter profit as fewer patients were treated with its flagship drugs for hepatitis C, sending shares of the biotechnology company down 2.5 percent. After one-time items, Gilead earned $2.23 a share, falling short of the $2.28 forecast by Wall Street analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The miss “was driven by lighter revenues, higher R&D; (research and development), and higher tax,” offset by a litigation gain, according to Mizuho analyst Salim Syed. Quarterly sales of hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa totaled $2.6 billion, down from $4.3 billion a year earlier. Analysts had forecast hepatitis C sales of $2.65 billion. Gilead warned earlier this year that sales of the high-priced drugs were declining due to a combination of fewer patients being deemed eligible for treatment and growing competition from other drugmakers. Sales of other antiviral products, including Gilead’s other main franchise of HIV drugs, rose to $3.3 billion from $2.9 billion for the same period in 2016.  The company’s first-quarter net income fell to $2.7 billion from $3.6 billion a year earlier.  Gilead Chief Executive Officer John Milligan told analysts on a conference call that 2017 “is progressing as we expected,” with the number of patients started on hepatitis C treatments dropping off following an initial “rapid increase in the number of patients treated and cured.”  He said Gilead, with $34 billion in cash at the end of March, continues to explore “making partnerships and potential acquisitions.”  U.S. President Donald Trump has called for bringing corporate profits being held offshore by multinationals into the country at a tax rate well below the 35 percent now owed on “repatriated” earnings, but Milligan downplayed the influence of such efforts on Gilead’s strategy. “There may be tax reform,” Milligan said. “There may be repatriation - but we can’t count on it or wait for it.” Overall revenue for the quarter fell to $6.5 billion from $7.8 billion. It is “shocking to see continued and even accelerating (sales) decline,” said Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges.   The company repeated its previous forecast for 2017 product sales of $22.5 billion to $24.5 billion. Shares of Gilead were down 2.5 percent at $66.85 in after-hours trading.

By Ben Hirschler and Akankshita Mukhopadhyay (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc will go head-to-head with rival versions of an improved class of HIV medicines, after clinical studies showed the U.S. company’s new drug bictegravir was as effective as GSK’s product. Four late-stage studies from Gilead all met their goals, with bictegravir matching the efficacy of GSK’s established dolutegravir, which has been the cornerstone of the British group’s growing HIV business in recent years. Both drugs are so-called integrase inhibitors, a type of medicine that has proved extremely effective at blocking the AIDS virus. They are designed to be given alongside older antiretroviral therapies. In a statement on Tuesday, Gilead said drug combinations testing bictegravir had proved equally good, or “non-inferior”, to combinations using dolutegravir, as measured by their ability to suppress levels of HIV. The news confirms a looming competitive threat to GSK’s important ViiV Healthcare business, but it also suggests the balance may not tip overwhelmingly in favor of Gilead. Gilead shares were little changed, while GSK rose 1.8 percent in London as Deutsche Bank analysts said the news “alleviates a small risk that bictegravir would have superior efficacy to dolutegravir”. The results are nonetheless a success for California-based Gilead, which Berenberg analysts said was likely to take a meaningful portion of growth in the HIV treatment market, with annual bictegravir sales reaching $3.8 billion by 2020. Gilead plans to apply this year for regulatory approval to sell its combination of bictegravir and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF), with a submission in the United States in the second quarter and Europe in the third quarter. If Gilead uses a priority voucher at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, it could launch in the U.S. market in the first quarter of 2018, some industry analysts said. For a long time Gilead has dominated the HIV market but GSK fought back strongly with dolutegravir, which has been a star performer recently. Now Gilead is hoping to reaffirm its dominance with its new three-drug combination based around bictegravir. GSK, meanwhile, is working on a two-drug treatment regimen. Two of Gilead’s studies tested its combination against a regimen containing GSK’s dolutegravir in previously untreated patients.  The other two trials involved patients who were already on HIV therapies, one of which including GSK’s dolutegravir, but were switched to the Gilead combination.  Data showed the Gilead combination was as effective and also well tolerated. No patients discontinued treatment due to kidney problems, a common side effect seen with HIV treatments.  Antiretroviral therapy has turned HIV from a death sentence into a manageable condition but patients need to stay on treatment for life, so there is a growing focus on making medication as well-tolerated as possible.

Two of Gilead’s studies tested its combination against a regimen containing GSK’s dolutegravir in previously untreated patients. The other two trials involved patients who were already on HIV therapies, one of which including GSK’s dolutegravir, but were switched to the Gilead combination. Data showed the Gilead combination was as effective and also well tolerated. No patients discontinued treatment due to kidney problems, a common side effect seen with HIV treatments. Antiretroviral therapy has turned HIV from a death sentence into a manageable condition but patients need to stay on treatment for life, so there is a growing focus on making medication as well-tolerated as possible.

525,GILD,FDA approves Gilead's drug for chronic hep C patients,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc said on Tuesday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its hepatitis C drug for patients who had failed to respond to prior treatments. Vosevi is the first drug to be approved for hepatitis C patients already treated with Sovaldi or other drugs, which inhibit a protein called NS5A, the FDA said in a separate release.   The approval is based on data from two late-stage studies, which evaluated 12 weeks of the drug in previously treated patients, the company said. However, the approval comes with a boxed warning about the risk of hepatitis B virus being reactivated in patients  infected with both hepatitis C and hepatitis B.  Gilead, whose growth has been fueled by its arsenal of hepatitis C drugs, had warned earlier this year that sales of its high-priced drugs were declining due to fewer patients being deemed eligible for treatment and rising competition. First-quarter sales of the company’s hepatitis C drugs, Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa, slumped to $2.6 billion from $4.3 billion a year earlier. Hepatitis C causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to diminished organ function or its failure.

After one-time items, Gilead earned $2.56 a share. Wall Street analysts, on average, had forecast adjusted earnings of $2.15 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “People had a sense they were going to beat on the HCV (hepatitis C) side and that’s where most of it came from,” said Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges. But with a rival drug from AbbVie Inc ABBV.O likely to be approved by regulators next month, the stronger sales trend is unlikely to continue, he said. Gilead’s quarterly sales of hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa totaled $2.9 billion, down from $4 billion a year earlier, but above the $2.23 billion forecast by analysts. Chief Executive John Milligan, on a conference call with investors and analysts, said the competitive threat hinges on “unknowns” including AbbVie’s pricing, how it promotes its drug and contracts with health insurers and other payers. Gilead warned earlier this year that sales of its high-priced hepatitis C drugs were declining as fewer patients were deemed eligible for treatment and competition grew. Second-quarter sales of other antiviral products, including Gilead’s other main franchise of HIV drugs, rose to $3.6 billion from $3.1 billion for the same period in 2016. Gilead raised its full-year 2017 product sales estimate to between $24 billion and $25.5 billion, up from a previous range of $22.5 billion to $24.5 billion. Milligan said Gilead was confident in its prospects for both the HIV and HCV markets but has been “very, very active” in assessing other potential business opportunities. “When the things are right for us, we will announce them,” he said. “It is very clear that they are preparing themselves to be much more acquisitive,” Porges said, citing actions including scaled back share buybacks and cuts in research spending. Net income fell to $3.1 billion from $3.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Overall revenue fell to $7.14 billion from $7.78 billion.

532,GILD,"UPDATE 3-AbbVie to remain cautious on drug pricing, shares fall","(Reuters) - AbbVie Inc’s (ABBV.N) said it would be cautious with drug pricing, especially for Humira, the world’s biggest selling drug, sending its shares down 2 percent, despite the drugmaker’s quarterly profit narrowly beating estimates. Abbvie CEO Richard Gonzalez said on Friday the company would continue to be “careful and conservative” about pricing, even though the drugmaker has already concluded negotiations with insurers for coverage of its Humira drug in 2017 and 2018.  “I’d say even in this last cycle, we have been even a little more conservative than we have been in the past because this (drug pricing) has become such a heated topic in the United States,” Gonzalez said. AbbVie had in January pledged to limit drug price hikes to under 10 percent and once a year, as political and payer scrutiny into drug pricing intensified in United States. Overall sales of Humira, which is used to treat autoimmune disorders and has a list price of $4,441 for a two-pen pack, rose 13.7 percent to $4.72 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $4.64 billion, according to Barclays. The drug’s U.S. sales rose 18 percent, driven by pricing as well as low double-digit prescription growth, AbbVie executives said.  However, the blockbuster drug faces looming competition from copycat versions in the United States. AbbVie has been trying to block the launch of Amgen’s (AMGN.O) Humira knock-off.  Earlier this year, the U.S. patent office ruled in favor of Coherus Biosciences’ (CHRS.O) Humira copy, in a move that analysts say could advance its U.S. launch by a year. AbbVie’s cancer drug Imbruvica, which it jointly owns with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), raked in sales of $626 million, above the consensus estimate of $609 million. Sales of its hepatitis C treatment, Viekira Pak, came at $225 million, well below the consensus estimate of $257 million, as rival products from Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) and Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) ate into sales.  AbbVie said regulatory decisions on its next-generation hepatitis C treatment, Maviret, are expected in the coming weeks. If approved, the company expects to see a meaningful impact to sales only in 2018.   Excluding items, the company earned $1.42 per share, beating analysts’ estimates by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AbbVie’s net revenue rose to $6.94 billion, edging past estimates of $6.93 billion. Shares of the company, which maintained its adjusted profit forecast for 2017, were down at $70.34 in afternoon trading.

Santa Monica, California-based Kite is developing chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, known as a CAR T, which harnesses the body’s own immune cells to recognize and attack malignant cells. Gilead will pay $180 per share in an all-cash deal, representing a 29.4 percent premium over Kite’s Friday close.  Kite’s shares rose 28 percent to $178.65 in morning trading, while Gilead’s shares rose 2.8 percent to $75.86.  Recent breakthroughs convinced Gilead’s management that they needed to buy a company developing CAR T treatments. “It really became clear that it was going to work and it was going to work in more than one kind of tumor... And then, importantly, that the manufacturing on an industrial scale could work,” Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan told investors on a conference call. “Now is the right time to get involved in this kind of therapy.” Gilead’s growth has been fueled by its pricey but revolutionary hepatitis C drugs but with fewer eligible patients and rising competition, sales have begun to fall. Second-quarter sales of its hepatitis C drugs - Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa - totaled $2.9 billion, down from $4 billion a year earlier.  Kite is one of the leading players in the emerging field of CAR T, and is competing with rivals Novartis AG, Juno Therapeutics Inc and Bluebird Bio Inc in a race to get the first approved therapy.  Juno shares rose 15 percent and Bluebird shares rose 10 percent in morning trading on hopes that other deals in the sector will follow. If approved, these drugs are expected to cost up to $500,000 and generate billions of dollars in sales. Success would also help advance a cancer-fighting technique that scientists have been trying to perfect for decades.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to decide by Nov. 29 whether to approve Kite’s CAR T, axi-cel, for treatment of adults with advanced lymphoma.  Wall Street and Gilead shareholders have long been expecting Gilead to use its cash pile for a big-ticket acquisition. Gilead is hoping the deal, expected to close in the fourth quarter, repeat the success of its 2011 purchase of Pharmasset. That deal allowed Gilead, then the world’s largest maker of HIV drugs, to move into hepatitis C treatments. Last year, just under half of Gilead’s $30 billion in sales came from hepatitis C treatments.  The company faced strong criticism for the steep price tag on those treatments, and the cost of Kite’s CAR T offerings will likely generate backlash for the company as well. “There will be headlines just because the price itself is so high,” said Brad Loncar, CEO of Loncar Investments, which runs the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. “But unlike hepatitis C, they are treating patients that only have weeks or months to live and providing durable remissions.” BofA Merrill Lynch and Lazard are Gilead’s financial advisers, while Centerview Partners is advising Kite.

The drug, Yescarta, is the second in a new class of cancer treatments known as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, or CAR-T, which reprograms the body’s own immune cells to recognize and attack malignant cells.

551,GILD,"FDA approves Gilead cancer gene therapy; price set at $373,000","(Reuters) - U.S. regulators approved on Wednesday a new therapy for a type of lymphoma, which was developed by Gilead Science Inc’s (GILD.O) Kite Pharma, marking the second approval for this potentially revolutionary approach to fighting cancer. The Food and Drug Administration approved the gene therapy, to be sold under the name Yescarta, to treat adults with large B-cell lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, who have failed to respond to other treatments. Gilead, which recently acquired Kite Pharma, said the list price for Yescarta, which is to be administered just once to each patient, would be $373,000.  The price is well below that of the first drug in this new  class - Novartis AG’s (NOVN.S) $475,000 Kymriah. The Novartis gene therapy was approved in August for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common form of childhood cancer in the United States. Both are chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, or CAR-Ts, which reprogram the body’s own immune cells to recognize and attack malignant cells.  The high price of CAR-Ts is igniting a new debate over the rising cost of prescription drugs. Novartis said it would charge for Kymriah only if patients responded within a month of the treatment, but Gilead is not following suit. “We are in ongoing and active discussions with payers, and we have communicated our openness to considering different solutions that improve patient access,” Gilead spokeswoman Amy Flood said in an email. She said the price was set following extensive research with both government agencies that reimburse for drug costs and private insurers, and cancer centers. Gilead Sciences shares rose almost 4 percent to $83 in after-the-bell trading. Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said Yescarta could generate sales of up to $250 million in 2018. Gilead said about 7,500 lymphoma patients each year in the United States would be eligible for CAR-T therapy. The American Cancer Society estimates that 72,240 people will be diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma this year and 20,140 people will die from it. This type of lymphoma accounts for about 4 percent of all cancers in the United States. Potentially curative CAR-T therapies are poised to revolutionize blood cancer treatment, offering therapies tailored to the individual patient. The treatments are made from a patient’s own infection-fighting cells. They are extracted, genetically engineered to recognize cancer cells, and infused back into the patient, where they form an army to attack and destroy malignant cells, potentially for years. “Gene therapy has gone from being a promising concept to a practical solution to deadly and largely untreatable forms of cancer,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement. In a pivotal clinical trial of more than 100 adults, 51 percent of patients treated with Yescarta achieved complete remission, far higher than what is typical with current standard-of-care treatments. Gilead agreed in August to pay about $12 billion to acquire Kite Pharma, two days before the U.S. approval of Novartis’ Kymriah boosted confidence in the entire CAR-T class.

556,GILD,Gilead weak hepatitis C sales outlook sends shares lower,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O) posted better-than-expected third-quarter profit on Thursday, but shares fell after hours as use of its flagship hepatitis C drugs waned further and the company said it expects to feel the full impact of more competition in the current quarter. Shares of Gilead, which in August paid nearly $12 billion for cancer immunotherapy company Kite Pharma, fell as much as 4 percent after hours and were last trading at $74.94. For the quarter, the drugmaker said it earned $2.27 a share after one-time items. Wall Street analysts, on average, had forecast $2.13 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Gilead’s quarterly sales of hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi, Harvoni, Epclusa and Vosevi totaled $2.2 billion, down from $3.3 billion a year earlier, and near the $2.24 billion forecast by analysts. The company’s antiviral and HIV drug sales rose to $3.6 billion from $3.5 billion. Net income fell to $2.7 billion from $3.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. Gilead warned earlier this year that sales of its high-priced hepatitis C drugs were declining as fewer patients were deemed eligible for treatment and competition increased from rivals like AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N). “New competition has further eroded Gilead’s market share and net pricing,” Gilead Chief Executive Officer John Milligan told investors on a conference call. “The impact ... will be more fully reflected beginning in the fourth quarter.” The company said it now expects full-year 2017 hepatitis C sales of no more than $9 billion, down from a previous high-end estimate of $9.5 billion. If the forecast rate continues through next year, it implies full-year 2018 sales of around $5.4 billion - below the mean Wall Street forecast of $6.9 billion - but Gilead executives declined to comment on expectations for next year. Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said in a research note that it was “not clear if Gilead is just setting expectations low or if they’re seeing something more.” Gilead also raised the lower end of its full-year 2017 product sales outlook to $24.5 billion from a previous estimate of $24 billion, leaving the upper end unchanged at $25.5 billion. Overall quarterly revenue fell to $6.5 billion from $7.5 billion, while analysts had forecast $6.4 billion. Research and development costs dropped to $789 million from $1.14 billion. Gilead said it was still working on logistics for launching sales of newly approved Yescarta, the $373,000 one-time treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma developed by Kite. The therapy is part of a new class known as chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR-T) designed to reprogram immune system cells to attack cancer cells.

560,GILD,GSK and Gilead go head to head as HIV drugs enter new phase,"LONDON (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) are heading for an HIV showdown, pushing rival treatment visions and competing products that are expected to hit the market in the next few months. Gilead is likely to secure the bigger near-term win, as it builds on a 20-year-old strategy of combining three drugs to control the AIDS virus, while GSK is placing a longer bet that its core drug is potent enough to work with just one other. If it succeeds, GSK could rewrite treatment standards by delivering cheaper two-drug regimens with fewer side effects. Gilead says the idea may risk drug resistance because the virus will only have to evade two drugs rather than three. The stakes are high for the two leaders in the $27-billion-a-year HIV market, with shares of around 53 and 22 percent respectively, according to industry data. GSK’s new Chief Executive Emma Walmsley has made HIV one of two central pillars of the British company’s pharmaceuticals division, along with respiratory medicine, after deciding to cutback in other areas. For California-based Gilead, a new HIV product is an opportunity to boost sales in a key antiviral area, following the rapid rise and fall of its hepatitis C business. Deborah Waterhouse, who took over as head of GSK’s majority-owned HIV business ViiV Healthcare in April, told Reuters she was braced for “intense competition”. ViiV, in which Pfizer (PFE.N) and Shionogi (4507.T) have small stakes, has been on a roll since 2013 due to the success of its super-effective integrase inhibitor drug dolutegravir, which is already included as part of traditional triple therapy. Gilead has now matched dolutegravir with an equally good rival in bictegravir and the U.S. group hopes to win U.S. approval by Feb. 12 to launch it with two other drugs, creating a combination known as BIC/F/TAF. “The playing-field is about to become more level as Gilead brings BIC/F/TAF to market. It is undoubtedly true that from mid-February next year it is going to become a much more competitive space,” Waterhouse said in an interview.  Investors fear the impact on GSK’s star HIV business, which grew sales 26 percent to 3.2 billion pounds ($4.25 billion) in the first nine months of 2017, especially as growth in the key U.S. HIV market is slowing.  Although millions of people are now treated in poor countries with cheap generics, the premium-priced U.S. market still accounts for 65-70 percent of global HIV sales by value. With nearly 2 million new infections globally each year, researchers are pushing on with new approaches to a disease that is increasingly an issue for older patients who have been kept alive by modern drugs but are more vulnerable to side effects. Many doctors currently mix and match medicines to get access to the best-in-class agents of dolutegravir and TAF. As a result, between 40 and 45 percent of U.S. patients on GSK’s Tivicay, the brand name for dolutegravir, take it with Gilead’s Descovy, which includes TAF. But Gilead’s new three-way pill will remove the need for those two separate prescriptions, which is a cost factor for private U.S. patients. Waterhouse expects Gilead’s new drug to see “significant uptake”, but she doesn’t anticipate a wholesale rush to switch therapy as most HIV patients only see their doctor twice a year. GSK’s own approach of promoting two-drug cocktails will be a slower affair, even though it hopes to get a U.S. green light for its first combination of dolutegravir and rilpivirine by Dec. 1, two months ahead of Gilead’s new drug approval. The problem is demand for this particular dual drug regimen is likely to be limited, in part because rilpivirine must be taken with a meal, which requires patients to have breakfast at exactly the same time each day. The real opportunity for GSK will come with the combination of dolutegravir and the cheap off-patent drug 3TC. That should reach the market in the second half of 2019, assuming clinical trials pan out well. “This is the start of a journey,” Waterhouse said. “You will see a much faster uptake of BIC/F/TAF than dolutegravir/rilpivirine - that is to be expected - but then we will build up with dolutegravir/3TC.” Having a cheaper product is particularly important in cost-conscious Europe. Patented HIV drugs remain pricey in developed markets, with Tivicay carrying a U.S. list price of $1,536 a month, although developing countries can buy generic HIV drugs for a fraction of this. Not everyone is convinced by GSK’s two-drug approach, given that drug resistance is a perennial worry in HIV. Indeed, there was one case of a patient in a clinical trial developing resistance earlier this year, although GSK believes this was likely down to failure to take the drugs properly. Overall, the clinical evidence to date suggests dual-drug regimens can safely keep HIV at bay without risking resistance, GSK says.

561,GILD,UPDATE 1-Novartis seeks European approval for cell therapy Kymriah,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis has submitted its cell therapy Kymriah for European approval in two forms of blood cancer, seeking to expand the use of a new treatment it hopes will eventually become a $1 billion-a-year seller. Novartis has applied to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Kymriah to be used in children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and adult patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant, the company said on Monday.  The therapy has been approved in the United States in pediatric ALL and was submitted in the world’s largest drug market for adults with DLBCL last week. The immunotherapy Kymriah is a key element of Novartis’s efforts to bolster its portfolio of oncology drugs. It has been hit by the patent expiry of its once top-selling blood cancer medicine Gleevec, whose market is quickly being eroded by generic rivals. “The submission to the EMA is a major step toward our goal of delivering it to more critically ill cancer patients around the world,” said Vas Narasimhan, Novartis’s drug development chief who will take over as chief executive from Joe Jimenez on Feb. 1.  Kymriah is a chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy in which patients’ immune cells are taken from their bodies, genetically re-engineered to fight their cancer and then reinfused. While Kymriah’s landmark approval in August in the United States signaled a new era in cancer treatment, the drug now faces rivals in the DLBCL setting. Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Gilead’s Yescarta for patients with the disease who had failed other treatments. Novartis set the price for Kymriah at $475,000 per treatment for young patients with ALL that respond to the treatment, but the Basel-based company has yet to announce the price for additional indications and geographies. Gilead charges $373,000 for Yescarta per patient. ",11062017,http://www.reuters.com/article/novartis-kymriah/update-1-novartis-seeks-european-approval-for-cell-therapy-kymriah-idUSL5N1NC0ZS

567,GILD,Gilead's new drug keeps 56 percent of lymphoma trial patients alive,"(Reuters) - More than half of trial patients with an advanced, aggressive form of blood cancer lived for at least a year after one-time treatment with Yescarta, a novel therapy sold by Gilead Sciences Inc, according to study results presented on Sunday. Yescarta, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October for aggressive large B-cell lymphoma that did not respond to other treatments, is part of a new class known as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies, or CAR-Ts, designed to reprogram the body’s own immune cells to recognize and attack malignant cells.  Follow-up on 108 patients treated with Yescarta showed that 42 percent remained in remission after a median of 15 months, and 56 percent were still alive, according to research presented in Orlando at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology. “This is an extremely valuable therapy for some patients who have no other options,” said Dr Frederick Locke, vice chair of the department of blood and marrow transplant and cellular immunotherapy at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida and the trial’s co-lead investigator. He said patients who achieve remission after receiving Yescarta tend to stay in remission, but more work needs to be done to determine why some do not respond to the cell therapy. After analyzing tumor tissue from before and after treatment in patients who relapsed, the researchers found that in a third of patients the CD19 protein targeted by Yescarta was no longer present on cancer cells. Also, more than two-thirds of tumors showed evidence of another protein, PDL1, likely helping the cancer cells survive. Gilead is also studying Yescarta in combination with a PDL1 antibody, Roche Holding AG’s Tecentriq, and results from an early-stage trial of that combination will be announced at ASH on Monday. Gilead acquired Yescarta, which has a U.S. list price of $373,000, with its buyout earlier this year of Kite Pharmaceuticals.

568,GILD,'Unheard of' responses to bluebird CAR-T therapy seen in myeloma study,"(Reuters) - More than half of patients with advanced multiple myeloma who had run out of therapeutic options remained in complete remission after receiving bluebird bio Inc’s experimental gene-modifying immunotherapy in a small, early stage study, according to updated data released on Sunday. Of 18 patients who received a therapeutic dose of bb2121, all but one responded to the treatment, a 94 percent response rate, while 56 percent remained in remission with a median follow-up of 40 weeks after treatment. Researchers, who reported the data at the American Society of Hematology meeting in Atlanta, said the initial response to the treatment was very quick and that many of the patients continued to improve over time.   Patients in the Phase I dose-escalation study had received seven prior treatment regimens, including regimens with the newest multiple myeloma drugs, such as Johnson & Johnson’s Darzalex, and had undergone at least one stem cell transplant before receiving bb2121, which is being co-developed with Celgene Corp. “Some of these patients were going to hospice until they got this,” said Dr. Jesus Berdeja, the study’s lead investigator. “This is unheard of, something that we haven’t seen with any drugs approved for myeloma in this type of population. The excitement among all the myeloma providers is crazy,” said Berdeja, director of myeloma research at the Sarah Cannon Center for Blood Cancer in Nashville. bb2121 belongs to a potentially revolutionary new type of one-time treatment called CAR-T therapy that involves genetic manipulation of a patient’s immune system. A patient’s own disease-fighting T-cells are harvested and genetically reengineered to target specific proteins on cancer cells before being replaced so they can circulate seeking out and attacking the cancer, possibly for years. The first two CAR-T therapies from Novartis and Gilead Sciences, through its acquisition of Kite Pharma, were approved earlier this year for other blood cancers. Three patients who received what proved to be sub-optimal doses of cells early in the bb2121 study died. Of the 18 who received higher doses, four patients have now experienced disease progression, while 14 continue to respond, researchers reported. The treatment was very well tolerated for a CAR-T product, Berdeja said. Only two patients experienced serious cytokine release syndrome with no reports of serious brain toxicity, both common side effects of CAR-T treatment. The most serious side effect was neutropenia, or very low white blood cell count, researchers said. While this was a small Phase I study, the results were considered so impressive that Celgene plans to begin enrolling patients this month for a larger, potentially pivotal trial that could position bb2121 to become the third approved CAR-T. “They’re hitting it so far out of the park that they’re not wasting any time,” Berdeja said.

572,GILD,$11 billion biotech binge fuels forecasts of 2018 M&A; surge,"LONDON (Reuters) - An $11 billion (8.12 billion pounds) burst of biotech bids in just four days has fuelled expectations of a 2018 surge in life science deals as large drugmakers shop for promising assets from smaller rivals. Separate reports on Monday by consultancy EY and law firm Baker McKenzie both predict a significant rise in mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) this year, helped by U.S. tax changes that may lift big companies’ appetite for deals. Celgene’s (CELG.O) up to $7 billion agreed takeover of Impact Biomedicines, Novo Nordisk’s (NOVOb.CO) $3.1 billion offer for Ablynx (ABLX.BR) and Takeda Pharmaceutical’s (4502.T) plan to buy TiGenix (G9U.BR) for $630 million have already got 2018 off to a flying start. This follows a relatively subdued 2017, when total life sciences M&A; totalled around $200 billion, dominated by Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ.N) $30 billion purchase of Actelion and Gilead’s (GILD.O) $12 billion acquisition of Kite. EY is confident this year’s deal value will exceed $200 billion, given companies’ increased financial firepower and balance sheet strength. There is also substantial pent-up demand, with 60 percent of life sciences executives surveyed in October 2017 planning to actively pursue M&A; in the next 12 months, compared with 46 percent in April. Baker McKenzie, meanwhile, predicts global healthcare M&A; could rise 50 percent in 2018, with North America accounting for well over half of transactions. Driving the demand is the increasingly pivotal role of biotech firms in discovering the drugs of tomorrow. “I believe you will see a higher proportion of innovation at an industry level — and also at Novo Nordisk — coming from external resources,” Novo’s Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard told Reuters. “Ablynx is an example of strong technology development occurring in a smaller biotech setting, with considerable speed and a lack of some of the bureaucracy you can get at large pharma companies.” U.S. drug approvals hit a 21-year high in 2017, with 46 novel medicines winning a green light and a growing share of new products coming from younger biotech companies. For large drugmakers, as well as big biotech businesses like Gilead and Celgene, small and innovative upstarts are now a vital source of experimental drugs with which to top up in-house development pipelines. Pricing pressures on established medicines for conditions like diabetes and respiratory disorders, as well as patent expiries on yesterday’s blockbusters, are driving big players into niche disease areas where biotech groups often excel, according to Edison analyst and former fund manager Andy Smith. “The pressures at big pharma look to be increasing and 90 percent of prescriptions in the U.S. are now for generics, so that pushes companies to look at cutting-edge therapies and it takes them straight into the biotech wheelhouse,” he said. Whether 2018 will turn out to be a golden year for biotech M&A; remains to be seen, but investors like event-driven hedge fund Case Equity Partners have high hopes for the drugs sector, following recent implementation of U.S. tax changes. “U.S. companies with lots of cash trapped overseas can now put capital to work in the global M&A; market more easily. We hence expect 2018 to be immensely active with multiple competitive auctions at significant premia,” the fund said in a an end-of-year letter. Although bankers say the U.S. tax overhaul and particularly a lower tax rate for the repatriation of cash held offshore has so far had limited impact on deal negotiations, they believe companies may decide to allocate more cash to M&A; in 2018. The M&A; outlook is likely to be a hot topic at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference starting on Monday in San Francisco, when many biotech deals and alliances are often announced.

For full-year 2018, the biotechnology company forecast product sales of $20 billion to $21 billion, down from $25.7 billion last year. The company also projected a 2018 tax rate of 21 percent to 23 percent. Gilead, which last year paid nearly $12 billion for cancer immunotherapy company Kite Pharma, said it earned $1.78 a share in the fourth quarter excluding one-time items. Wall Street analysts, on average, had forecast $1.67 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Including a $6 billion income tax charge related to U.S. corporate tax changes, the company posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $3.87 billion.

586,GILD,UPDATE 1-Drugmaker GSK wins fresh Advair reprieve as Novartis copy delayed,"LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline has won another reprieve for its blockbuster Advair lung drug after U.S. regulators delayed approval of a generic copy from Novartis’s Sandoz division. The Swiss drugmaker said in an emailed statement on Thursday it had received a so-called complete response letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a generic Advair launch this year was now “highly unlikely”.  Such letters typically outline concerns and conditions that must be addressed to gain U.S. approval. The setback follows similar delays last year for rival copies of GSK’s inhaled drug developed by Mylan and Hikma, which has been working with Vectura. After Mylan and Hikma’s problems, most industry analysts expected the generic threat had been pushed back until mid-2018, providing Britain’s biggest drugmaker with a short-term profit boost. But the Sandoz news may cause a rethink. “It now looks like the can has been kicked down the road,” Berenberg analysts said in a note. Advair is particularly difficult for generic drugmakers to copy because they must develop an inhaler device that delivers the medicine correctly into patients’ lungs. The fact that Sandoz, one of the world’s most experienced generics firms, has also stumbled highlights the challenges of making a generic that is acceptable to the FDA, although such Advair copies are already available in Europe. The timing of the arrival of generic Advair in the United States is critical to GSK’s near-term earnings outlook. The drugmaker said on Wednesday that earnings, at constant exchange rates, would be flat to down 3 percent in 2018 if generic Advair launches in the U.S market by mid-year. Without generics, earnings would be up 4 to 7 percent. A GSK spokesman had no immediate comment on the latest Sandoz news. Dealing with the threat to Advair, which has generated more than $1 billion in annual sales since 2001, is a key challenge facing GSK’s core pharmaceuticals division. Another is the competitive pressure in its big HIV medicines division, where Gilead Sciences on Wednesday won a FDA green light for a once-daily, triple-combination tablet containing a new integrase inhibitor bictegravir. GSK’s majority-owned ViiV Healthcare unit hit back by filing a lawsuit alleging that Gilead was infringing patents on ViiV’s rival integrase inhibitor dolutegravir. ViiV is not looking to have Gilead’s product removed from the market but it wants compensation, which analysts said could result in royalties being paid to ViiV by Gilead, if the legal action is successful. GSK shares were 2.7 percent higher by 0910 GMT. ",2082018,http://www.reuters.com/article/gsk-advair-novartis/update-1-drugmaker-gsk-wins-fresh-advair-reprieve-as-novartis-copy-delayed-idUSL8N1PY2SO

Biktarvy combines new integrase inhibitor bictegravir with Descovy, an older medication that combines nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide. Rival ViiV Healthcare, a joint venture majority-owned by GlaxoSmithKline Plc with Pfizer Inc and Shionogi Ltd, quickly filed a lawsuit alleging that Gilead was infringing patents on ViiV’s dolutegravir, a component of the venture’s triple-drug HIV treatment Triumeq. Viiv is seeking “financial redress,” but is not asking for an injunction against sales of Biktarvy, according to Glaxo spokeswoman Sarah Spencer. Gilead, in an emailed statement, said it remained “steadfast in our opinion that Biktarvy does not infringe ViiV’s U.S. patent, and that the court challenge did not affect the U.S. availability of the drug. “We believe that a modest royalty could be possible far down the road if Gilead were to lose” the patent case, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in a research note. Wall Street analysts, on average, forecast Biktarvy sales of around $1 billion this year, rising to a peak of nearly $5 billion annually by 2024, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Dolutegravir, sold under the brand name Tivicay and as a component of Triumeq, is a key growth driver for Glaxo, posting fiscal 2017 sales of nearly 4 billion pounds ($5.6 billion). The Gilead drug’s wholesale price, about $36,000 a year, is in line with current therapies, according to Guggenheim Securities. The global market for HIV drugs could reach as high as $40 billion a year by 2021, according to pharmaceutical data company Quintiles IMS Institute, now known as IQVIA. The new Gilead drug’s label includes a boxed warning that use could worsen hepatitis B infection in certain patients.     ViiV said it would seek to prove that Biktarvy infringed ViiV’s U.S. and Canadian patents covering dolutegravir and many other compounds that include dolutegravir’s unique chemical scaffold. The U.S. case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and the Canadian case in the Canadian Federal Court in Toronto.

590,GILD,Gilead wins reversal of $2.54 billion hepatitis C drug patent verdict,"(Reuters) - A federal judge in Delaware has overturned a jury’s verdict requiring Gilead Sciences Inc to pay a record $2.54 billion because its hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed a patent held by rival Merck & Co Inc. The verdict had been the largest ever in a U.S. patent case but U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark in Wilmington, Delaware, on Friday ruled Merck’s patent was invalid. He said it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation. Gilead in a statement on Saturday said it always believed the patent was invalid and was pleased the judge confirmed that opinion. Merck in a statement said it planned to appeal and believed the judge’s ruling did not reflect the facts of the case. The December 2016 verdict followed a trial in which jurors found that Merck’s patent on hepatitis C treatments, which it acquired in 2014 when it bought Idenix Pharmaceuticals, was valid. Hepatitis C, estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans, is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver failure.  Direct-acting antivirals, such as Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni, have revolutionized treatment, with cure rates of more than 90 percent shown in clinical trials. But there was a backlash from health insurers and other payors when Gilead launched Sovaldi at a price of $84,000 for a 12-week course. Foster City, California-based Gilead reported that in 2017 it earned $9.1 billion on its four products to treat hepatitis C, including Harvoni and Sovaldi. Idenix, the original holder of the patent at issue in the lawsuit, sued Gilead in 2013 in an effort to block the launch of Sovaldi, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December of that year. Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi’s active ingredient, sofosbuvir, with another drug, was approved in October 2014. Merck sells its own hepatitis C drug, Zepatier. The company won a $200 million jury verdict last March in a separate patent infringement case against Gilead over hepatitis C drugs. But in June 2016, a federal judge in San Jose, California, overturned that verdict after finding that Merck engaged in a pattern of unethical conduct, including lying under oath.

The deal is the latest by a major drugmaker looking to develop lucrative gene therapies that have the potential to treat ailments by directly targeting disease-causing genes. Shares of California biotech firm Sangamo jumped more than 20 percent to a 17-year high of $27.30 on Thursday morning. “These are indeed exciting times in the field of genome-editing and gene therapy,” Sangamo Chief Executive Officer Sandy Macrae said on a call with analysts. In December, Luxturna, a treatment for a rare disease that causes blindness, became the first gene therapy for an inherited disease to get U.S. regulatory approval. The treatment, developed by Philadelphia-based Spark Therapeutics Inc, is expected to be priced at $850,000. Gilead subsidiary Kite Pharma will use Sangamo’s platform to target a class of proteins called zinc finger nucleases in order to edit the human genome, helping develop therapies for cancer. Sangamo will receive $150 million upfront and is eligible for up to $3.01 billion in future payments tied to regulatory and other milestones. Gilead snapped up Kite Pharma in a $12 billion deal last year as a way to get access to an emerging class of cancer immunotherapies called CAR-T and to offset slowing sales of its hepatitis C medicines. Other firms specializing in CAR-T such as Juno Therapeutics have signed deals to use another kind of gene-editing technology called CRISPR.

601,GILD,FOCUS-GlaxoSmithKline prescribes commercial reboot for pharma division,"LONDON (Reuters) - In January, GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK.L) new head of pharmaceuticals Luke Miels issued a blunt challenge to his managers: find budget savings of 20 percent.    The plan was to pool the savings and reallocate the money to priority medicines and markets for Britain’s biggest drugmaker, according to people familiar with the meeting. The tough demand startled some GSK veterans who are used to a more consultative approach, said the sources. But it is a sign of the harder commercial edge new Chief Executive Emma Walmsley - almost 12 months into the job - is bringing to a company whose shares have moved sideways for years. Miels - a long-time protege of AstraZeneca (AZN.L) CEO Pascal Soriot, whose departure sparked a legal spat between the rival drugmakers - is a key lieutenant for Walmsley as she tries to overhaul the core pharma business. The unit has lagged rivals like Novartis (NOVN.S) and Merck & Co (MRK.N) in producing multibillion-dollar blockbusters, so Walmsley has prioritized plans to refocus both its research and marketing efforts in a drive for fewer but bigger new drugs. Miels declined to comment in detail on his budget demand, including the savings figure of 20 percent, but confirmed the strategic goal of achieving a leaner, meaner commercial footprint to match a recently pared-down research and development (R&D;) operation. The aim is to concentrate sales and marketing resources on new products, particularly lung drug Trelegy and shingles vaccine Shingrix, in 10 big markets - ranging from the United States, major European countries and Japan to China, India and Russia, he told Reuters. “In R&D;, we’re trying to pick which assets are most productive and are going to add the most value to patients. Well, we need to do the same thing in the commercial organization,” Miels said. “That is something that will become more visible over time and it is a process that we are going through now ... the strategy is more advanced than is visible externally.” One early casualty is the reversal of previous expansion in Africa.  GSK’s track record for bringing new drugs to market has actually been in the middle of its peer group since 2011, according to a recent Berenberg bank analysis, but its commercial performance has disappointed.  Miels and his colleague Hal Barron - a long-time Roche (ROG.S) scientist who joined in January as R&D; head - know they have their work cut. Even with a renewed sense of urgency, GSK’s new drug pipeline will not deliver its next batch of products before 2020 and, in the meantime, big challenges loom in two pivotal established disease areas. A new drug from Gilead Sciences (GILD.O) is set to dent GSK’s HIV business, while U.S. generic competition to aging lung drug Advair is coming. Adding to uncertainty is the possibility that Walmsley - a consumer products veteran who worked for 17 years at L’Oreal (OREP.PA) - might buy Pfizer’s (PFE.N) over-the-counter business for up to $20 billion. A deal may boost earnings but could prove a financial stretch.  GSK shares have underperformed the European healthcare sector by 16 percent since she took over on April 1, 2017, which has not been lost on skeptics like high-profile fund manager Neil Woodford, who sold out of GSK in May.   Walmsley announced plans last July to streamline pharma R&D; by ditching more than 30 drug projects. Still, Miels said he had the resources needed to build up the business in new focus areas like oncology and immunology, including potential funding for add-on biotech deals. Significant cash is already being put to work, especially in the company’s cancer research labs. Three years ago, GSK sold its established cancer medicines to Novartis. But it retained some early-stage projects that it now believes have the potential to leapfrog rivals and be at the forefront of treatment. They include an antibody drug for multiple myeloma, which could be launched in 2020, as well as new kinds of immunotherapy and cell therapies designed to modify patients’ immune cells. In cell therapy alone, GSK has spent “hundreds of millions of dollars” to build a large presence focused on T-cell receptors (TCRs), according to oncology R&D; head Axel Hoos. Its presence may be largely below the radar but GSK’s commitment is on a par with better-known cell therapy companies like Novartis, Gilead and Celgene (CELG.O), Hoos said in an interview. Unlike CAR-T cells that recognize proteins on the cell surface, TCRs can find tumor-specific proteins on the inside of cells and, significantly, they appear to be able to fight solid tumors, rather than just the blood cancers hit by CAR-T treatments like Novartis’ Kymriah and Gilead’s Yescarta. Just last week, GSK’s partner Adaptimmune (ADAP.O) reported a second solid tumor response to TCR therapy. The research is early and the cancer field is highly competitive but successful oncology drugs can deliver quickly, as rival AstraZeneca is starting to demonstrate. Consensus forecasts point to its 2018-22 annual earnings growth averaging 15.3 percent compared with just 5.3 percent for GSK.

604,GILD,UPDATE 2-FDA staff raises safety concerns over Lilly/Incyte arthritis drug,"(Reuters) - An experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug developed by Eli Lilly and Co and Incyte Corp poses serious risks of deadly blood clots at higher doses, U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff said on Thursday, the latest setback to a treatment regulators declined to approve last year. New data provided by the companies in a resubmission of their marketing application did not substantially alter information from the original, the staffers said. Shares of Lilly and Incyte were marginally down in early trading. “At this point, approval in the U.S. is in jeopardy,” Hilliard Lyons analyst Kurt Kemper told Reuters, adding that the review was much harsher than he had expected. Safety data supported a lower 2 mg dose of the drug, baricitinib, but not a 4 mg dose, raising questions whether the higher dose provides additional benefit, the staffers said. Also, the limited data available on the lower dose complicates the assessment of its risk/benefit analysis, the staffers added. Evercore ISI analyst Josh Schimmer said questions over the doses could result in an “awkward” label for the drug. Lilly and Incyte hope to launch baricitinib, a potential blockbuster, in the huge, competitive market for rheumatoid arthritis treatments, currently dominated by AbbVie’s Humira, the world’s top-selling prescription medicine. Baricitinib is a once-daily pill that belongs to a class of drugs known as JAK inhibitors, which work by blocking inflammation-causing enzymes known as Janus kinases. Ahead of Thursday’s assessment, experts were concerned that the review of baricitinib was likely to weigh on other companies with oral JAK inhibitors in their pipeline. However, agency staffers noted that the risk of thrombosis, or blood clotting, appeared unique to baricitinib and had not been observed in other therapies, especially Pfizer Inc’s already approved Xeljanz. “This could be a positive for competitors such as AbbVie and Gilead and Galapagos that have their own oral JAK inhibitors in late-stage development,” wrote Credit Suisse analysts. The confusion over doses could also benefit AbbVie’s experimental drug upadacitinib, Evercore ISI’s Schimmer said. All eyes are now on Monday’s advisory committee (Adcom) meeting when an independent panel of experts is scheduled to evaluate baricitinib based on data from the companies and the analysis by FDA staff.  The health regulator is not mandated to follow the panel’s recommendations, but usually does.    However, BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei was not optimistic. “We doubt the Adcom will alleviate the FDA’s safety concerns since they typically take a conservative approach, particularly when there is not a dire unmet need,” he wrote in a note to clients.

606,GILD,U.S. court upholds dismissal of $200 million Merck verdict against Gilead,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday affirmed a ruling that pharmaceutical company Merck & Co dishonestly obtained patent rights and was not entitled to collect a $200 million infringement verdict it won against rival Gilead Sciences Inc. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld a June 2016 ruling that the two Merck patents, which cover methods of treating Hepatitis C, were unenforceable because of a pattern of misconduct by the company, including lying under oath by one of its in-house lawyers.  A Gilead spokesman said the company was very pleased with the ruling and believe it was “justified and well supported by the record.”  A Merck spokeswoman said in a statement that the ruling “does not reflect the facts of the case” and that the company was reviewing its next steps. Direct-acting anti-virals, such as Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni, have revolutionized treatment of Hepatitis C, with cure rates of more than 90 percent. The viral disease is estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans and can lead to liver failure. A jury in federal court in San Jose, California, awarded Merck $200 million in 2016 after finding Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents. A judge threw out the verdict later that year, ruling the patents were unenforceable based on the company’s conduct. She noted that, in the process of applying for one of the patents, Merck used confidential information it obtained in 2004 while discussing a possible partnership with Pharmasset Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011.  The judge also said a Merck in-house lawyer testified untruthfully in a deposition and at trial about his participation in a confidential call with Pharmasset personnel. Merck appealed the ruling, saying there was no “deliberately planned and carefully executed scheme by Merck to defraud or deceive.” But the appeals court said in Wednesday’s ruling that the lower judge had sufficient reason to conclude that the Merck patents were “tainted” by misconduct and should not be enforceable. In February a federal judge in Delaware overturned a different jury verdict requiring Gilead to pay $2.54 billion for infringing another Merck patent relating to the hepatitis C drugs. The verdict had been the largest ever in a U.S. patent case, but the judge ruled Merck’s patent was invalid because it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation.

The company left its full-year sales outlook unchanged. Gilead said it earned $1.48 a share in the first quarter excluding onetime items. Analysts, on average, expected an adjusted profit of $1.67 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Quarterly sales of Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs dropped to $1.05 billion from $2.58 billion a year earlier, falling short of the $1.19 billion average analyst forecast. Sales of other antiviral and HIV drugs rose slightly to $3.33 billion from $3.27 billion. The results are “quite a bit below expectations, however it is very clear that a lot of the shortfall is due to inventory drawdown, consistent with first-quarter patterns,” said Jefferies analyst Michael Yee. “The stock is probably going to bounce back.” Sales of Gilead’s drugs to cure hepatitis C have been on a downward trend for some time due to increased competition from other companies, including AbbVie. “Hepatitis C is definitely weaker, but that should not be a complete shock,” Yee said. Sales of Yescarta, the cancer cell therapy acquired with Gilead’s $12 billion purchase last year of Kite Pharma, totaled $40 million for the quarter, beating analysts’ expectations of $23 million.

Quarterly sales of Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs dropped to $1.05 billion from $2.58 billion a year earlier, falling short of the $1.19 billion average analyst forecast. Sales of other antiviral and HIV drugs rose slightly to $3.33 billion from $3.27 billion. The results are “quite a bit below expectations, however it is very clear that a lot of the shortfall is due to inventory drawdown, consistent with first-quarter patterns,” said Jefferies analyst Michael Yee. “The stock is probably going to bounce back.” Sales of Gilead’s drugs to cure hepatitis C have been on a downward trend for some time due to increased competition from other companies, including AbbVie. “Hepatitis C is definitely weaker, but that should not be a complete shock,” Yee said. Sales of Yescarta, the cancer cell therapy acquired with Gilead’s $12 billion purchase last year of Kite Pharma, totaled $40 million for the quarter, beating analysts’ expectations of $23 million. For full-year 2018, the biotechnology company said it still expects net product sales of $20 billion to $21 billion and a 2018 tax rate of 21 percent to 23 percent.  Shares of Gilead, which rose half a percent to close at $72.56 in regular trading on the Nasdaq, were down 5.3 percent at $68.70 after hours.
