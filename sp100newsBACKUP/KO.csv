Strong hiring by U.S. private employers in June coupled with a larger-than-expected drop in jobless claims spurred hopes that the soft patch the U.S. economy has entered might be short, rather than lead to another recession.

3,KO,IFR-US CREDIT-Bondholders take backseat to shareholders," by Timothy Sifert  NEW YORK, July 8 (IFR) - The increase in shareholder-friendly activity among investment-grade bond issuers has bondholders concerned that their interest might not be at heart in the boardrooms of their portfolio companies.  US corporations have generally weathered the credit crisis with aplomb, socking away historically high levels of cash. But in many cases executives’ fiscal conservatism has been at the expense of growth, and therefore at the expense of shareholders.  As new opportunities open up many companies are changing their tack, rewarding shareholders with stock repurchaseS, higher dividends and, at times, acquisitions. In this case, what’s good for equity investors isn’t great for bond holders.  So far it has been the better-capitalised credits that have been spending, and bond investors haven’t complained much as a result. But should the shareholder-friendly trend continue on pace, there’s reason to worry.   “I’m surprised bondholders aren’t more concerned about this,” said one head of investment grade syndicate in New York.  There have been a slew of share-repurchase deals this year already, totalling about US$24.8bn and including trades from blue chip names Blackrock (BLK.N), Philip Morris International (MO.N), Best Buy (BBY.N), Coca-Cola (KO.N) and Microsoft (MSFT.O).  Indeed bondholders have said they are concerned about their holdings, but they say it’s not a market-wide problem. Only select names are guilty.  A Fitch report released last week suggests as much. The rating agency sought to highlight which investment grade companies might be most prone to institute shareholder-friendly policies in the future.  The report looked at metrics that might indicate a company would want to engage in share repurchases, restructurings, spinoffs, among other plans that are potentially damaging to bondholders. Borrowers with low ratios of enterprise value to EBITDA versus their high-grade peers, for example, might be acquisition targets or might pursue other potentially leveraging actions to boost the ratio.  The report highlights tens of borrowers. But to illustrate the thrust of the thesis it looked at RR Donnelley (RRD.N), the only company in the report without investment grade ratings. In May, Fitch, Moody’s and S&P downgraded RR Donnelley to junk.  “This company illustrates what can happen to ratings when cyclicality, long-term structural challenges, and accelerated share repurchases collide,” according to the report.  RR Donnelley is currently engaged in a US$1bn buyback programme it expects to complete next year. In addition, the rating agencies expect the company to pursue debt-financed acquisitions to get ahead in the slowing-moving printing sector.  Best Buy is another credit bondholders should be wary about. On June 27, Fitch downgraded the retailer two notches to BBB- in part because the retailer announced a new US$5bn share repurchase and a dividend increase. In March, Best Buy completed a US$650m 5.50% 10-year note at plus 200bp and a US$350m 3.75% five-year note at 162.5bp to fund the repurchase. The 10-year was quoted on TRACE at plus 249bp earlier this week.  Best Buy, like RR Donnelley, has opted to reward shareholders somewhat aggressively despite having many real challenges ahead.  “The company’s business profile faces amplified headwinds from same-store sales, market share, and competition,” Fitch wrote in the report.  Another borrower Fitch expounded on was Expedia (EXPE.O). The agency put the borrower’s ratings on negative watch in April after the company said it planned to spin off TripAdvisor to shareholders. If the divestiture goes ahead, existing bondholders will be left owning a weaker credit. Stockholders, though, will be better off.  Expedia was last in the US dollar bond market on August 2 last year. It printed a US$750m offering of 5.95% 10-year notes to yield plus 300bp. This week it was quoted on TRACE at plus 323bp.

At least two companies have had an interest in privately held Arizona and have had talks, the trade publication reported on Friday. Beverage Digest cited “several sources,” including one who said, “I don’t think anything is imminent.”   Sources cited enterprise valuations for Arizona ranging from $3 billion to $4.25 billion, Beverage Digest said.   Nestle, which makes Sweet Leaf Tea and Nestea, is said to be one of the interested parties, Beverage Digest said. It said Tata, which owns the Tetley brand, was the other.   Soft drink leader Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), which lags rivals in the U.S. tea market, was not mentioned by any sources as having a recent interest, Beverage Digest said.   Tata, Nestle, Arizona and Coca-Cola were not immediately available to comment.   Interest in bottled tea has risen in recent years as a growing health-consciousness led many people to look for alternatives to carbonated sodas. Arizona, which first hit New York City shelves in 1992, is known for its large cans of iced tea. It is now one of the biggest tea brands in the United States, tying PepsiCo Inc’s PEP.N Lipton with about a third of the market, according to Beverage Digest.

6,KO,Nestle buys 60 percent of Chinese candymaker for $1.7 billion,"SINGAPORE/ZURICH (Reuters)- Nestle NESN.VX, the world’s largest food company, is paying a hefty $1.7 billion for a 60 percent stake in candymaker Hsu Fu Chi International HSFU.SI to move deeper into fast-growing markets in China.  Nestle’s biggest deal in China so far will take it closer to its target of 45 percent of sales from emerging markets in about 10 years, and analysts said on Monday securing growth opportunities in China was worth a relatively high price.  “It is certainly not cheap but that is the price you have to pay to get access to this high-growth market,” Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy said.  “The fact that Hsu Chen will continue to lead the company is also very positive because he must be very well linked and have a well-established distribution network,” he said.  International companies have been rushing to expand in Asian markets, where buoyant economic growth has boosted consumers’ purchasing power.  On Monday alone, Asia-related deals worth some $15 billion were announced, such as Dutch group Philips’s (PHG.AS) buy of Chinese appliance firm Povos.  Nestle paid about 3.3 times sales for the stake, more than the 2.4 times U.S. food group Kraft Foods KFT.N paid for British candy group Cadbury.  The Nestle deal was relatively expensive when compared with top deals in the food sector. Only Mars Inc had to put more on the table for Wrigley at 4.2 times sales in 2008 and Danone (DANO.PA) for Numico at 4.5 times in 2007.  Kepler Capital Markets analyst Jon Cox said: “The deal makes strategic sense as, inevitably, China will become the biggest market for confectionery in the future. It looks a bit expensive at 3.5 times sales at first glance but you are paying for the future growth prospect.”  The Vevey-based maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Nescafe coffee strengthened its dairy business in China earlier this year when taking a 60 percent stake in Yinlu Foods Group for an undisclosed sum.  “Together with Yinlu Foods and Hsu Fu chi, Nestle will increase its Chinese business from around 2.8 billion Swiss francs ($3.35 billion) in 2010 to 4.2 billion francs,” Helvea analyst Andreas von Arx said.  The deal will allow Nestle to increase its footprint in emerging markets and get closer to catching up with rivals Danone and Unilever (UNc.AS) (ULVR.L), von Arx said.  Gaining access to Hsu Fu Chi’s comprehensive distribution network was also key for Nestle which has been present in China for over 20 years, operates 23 factories and employs 14,000 people.  Nestle shares were down 1.1 percent at 1310 GMT, versus a 0.6 percent weaker European food and beverage sector .SX3P.  Hsu Fu Chi, which makes sugar sweets, cereal-based snacks, cakes and the traditional Chinese snack sachima, is listed in Singapore and reported sales of 669 million Swiss francs in 2010. It employs 16,000 people.  “The outlook for China’s consumption demand is quite positive,” said Dan Bin, a fund manger at Shenzhen-based Eastern Bay Investment Management, which invests in consumer companies. “Nestle has a lot of experience in consumer brands and with the deal, they can build on what Hsu Fu Chi already has in the Chinese market.”  Under their agreement, Nestle will buy 43.5 percent of Hsu Fu Chi’s shares from independent shareholders at S$4.35, a premium of 8.7 percent over the July 1 closing price — trading in the Dongguan-based company’s shares were halted on July 1 when the companies said they were in talks.  If the scheme is approved by the independent shareholders, Nestle will acquire a 16.5 percent stake from the Hsu family, which founded the company in 1992 and leaving it with 40 percent. The company will then be delisted.  The deal, for which Credit Suisse advised Nestle, requires approval from China’s commerce ministry and authorities from Cayman Islands, where the company is incorporated, Hsu Fu Chi spokeswoman Christine Sun said.  “There are some concerns, especially after Coca-Cola’s failed bid for Huiyuan. There is a sense that the Chinese government might be trying to protect Chinese brands,” Shaun Rein, managing director at China Market Research Group, said.  “I would think that, in this case, it would not be a problem because we estimate the candy company only has about a 5.5 percent of the market, so it is a fairly niche market, and it is also a Taiwanese brand.”  Another analyst said partnering with a family minority shareholder should increase the likelihood and speed of regulatory approval. The process will likely take 3-5 months, a source close to the deal said.  Investors have worried that foreign bids for well-known Chinese brands were off the table since Chinese regulators blocked Coca-Cola’s (KO.N) $2.4 billion bid in 2009 for the country’s top juice maker, Huiyuan Juice (1886.HK).  However, British drinks group Diageo (DGE.L) won approval last month to increase its stake in Sichuan Shuijingfang (600779.SS), China’s fourth largest white spirits group.  Nestle’s offer came at a time when a series of accounting scandals at foreign-listed Chinese companies have triggered a sell-off in China-based stocks, prompting owners to consider mergers or partnerships.  Shares of Chinese companies listed in Singapore, known as S-chips, trade at a discount to their Singapore counterparts, which is forcing controlling shareholders to seek exits, said Tan Han Meng, an analyst at DMG & Partners.  The FT ST China Index .FTFSTC, which tracks shares of Chinese companies listed in Singapore, has fallen 11 percent since the start of the year, versus the Straits Times Index’s .FTSTI 1.9 percent fall.

9,KO,UPDATE 1-Novartis eyes international board listing in China-sources," (Adds detail, background)	   * Novartis has consulted Chinese government on IPO-sources   * China one of six priority emerging markets for Novartis   * International board may host only 10 companies initially-local media    By Samuel Shen and Soo Ai Peng	   SHANGHAI, July 12 (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG   is considering a possible initial public offering in China, joining a growing list of multinationals eyeing a listing on Shanghai’s planned international board, two people with knowledge of the situation said.	   Novartis is studying the feasibility of a China IPO and has been consulting relevant government agencies, said the sources, who declined to be identified because the information is not public. Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff declined to comment. 	   Selling shares in China would enable Novartis to raise money to fund rapid expansion in China and for potential acquisitions, as it competes fiercely with rivals such as Roche Holding AG  and Eli Lilly in the country. 	   Having its shares traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange could also help Novartis promote its brand in a country where concerns over food and drug safety constantly haunt consumers.	   China is among the six countries identified by Novartis as  priority emerging markets for the company, where combined net sales grew 12 percent in 2010 to $4.6 billion, accounting for 10 percent of the firm’s global sales, its annual report said.

11,KO,US food makers adopt new ad guidelines," NEW YORK, July 14 (Reuters) - Top U.S. food and drink makers, including Kraft Foods KFT.N, Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Kellogg Co (K.N), agreed on Thursday to follow voluntary nutrition criteria for products advertised to children.   But new criteria were quickly blasted as an attempt by the food industry to try to head off stronger government guidelines currently being considered.   The criteria, designed by the Council of Better Business Bureaus’ Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI), will require many companies to change the recipes of certain products they advertise to kids, including by reducing sodium, saturated fat, sugars and calories.   “Now foods from different companies, such as cereals or canned pastas, will meet the same nutrition criteria, rather than similar but slightly different company-specific criteria,” said Elaine Kolish, vice president and director of the CFBAI.   The companies have until Dec. 31, 2013 until the requirements go into effect.   There are different criteria for different product categories. For example, canned pastas must have no more than 350 calories, 600 milligrams of sodium and 15 grams of sugar per serving and juices are not allowed to have added sugars or more than 160 calories per serving.   The agreement comes on the last day to comment on a stricter set of requirements proposed by U.S. agencies including the Federal Trade Commission, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   The announcement from the CFBAI is “a transparent attempt to undermine the stronger standards proposed by the government’s Interagency Working Group,” according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.   “It’s great news that, at long last, the industry realizes that the current patchwork of inconsistent company pledges is not working, and that industry-wide nutrition guidelines are needed,” said CSPI nutrition policy director Margo Wootan.

The glitch came as the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), the country’s forex regulator, was concerned that the international board, shares on which are expected to be quoted in yuan, might go against the country’s goal of gradually opening up its capital account, the online version of Caixin said.	   The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) had previously said that shares traded on the international board would be quoted in yuan, the Chinese currency, Caixin said.	   Shang Fulin, chairman of the CSRC, said in May that the launch of the international board was “coming closer” to the market.	   However, officials at SAFE recently “argued that limiting board trading to yuan would clash with a government plan to phase in capital account convertibility,” Caixin said.	   This had pushed the international board project “back to square one,” the magazine said, citing one of the sources.

17,KO,Relaxation drinks see energetic growth in U.S.,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - People have been guzzling energy drinks for the last 10 years — maybe it’s time to relax.  Sales of “relaxation drinks” with names like Vacation in a Bottle, Dream Water and Just Chill, while small, are growing.  “There is clear potential for further growth in the coming years,” said Cecilia Martinez, market analyst at UK-based beverage research group Zenith International.  Relaxation drinks help the body chill out by relieving muscle tension and reducing levels of cortisone, the main stress hormone, according to a report that Martinez wrote about the drinks earlier this year.  The drinks, which evolved in Japan as far back as 2005, contain no alcohol but some have melatonin, a hormone that can cause drowsiness.  The biggest relaxation brands include Innovative Beverage Group’s Drank, Purple Stuff and Jones GABA. Another called Slow Cow is up and coming. Their names provide a marked contrast to engine-revving energy drinks such as Red Bull, Hansen Natural’s Monster and Dr Pepper Snapple Group’s Venom Energy.  Some 22.4 million cases, or 127 million liters (36 million gallons) of relaxation drinks were sold in 2010, double the amount sold in 2008. By 2014, U.S. volume sales will exceed 300 million liters (79 million gallons), Martinez said.  That is well below the 1.35 billion liters (357 million gallons) of energy drinks sold in 2009 alone, according to Zenith.  “Consumption trends of America show that Americans are always willing to try out new things — relaxation drinks might be one of those things,” said NPD Group Food & Beverage analyst Darren Seifer.  Carbonated soft drinks — or “sodas” to most people in the United States — far outsold the other drinks, with 9.36 billion cases moving in 2010.  Yet growing health consciousness has led many people to reach for drinks they consider healthier, like juices and waters. Many of these drinks claim to boost energy, metabolism and the ability to relax.  As a result, smaller niches are set to gain greater share over the next ten years, according to Seifer, especially as carbonated drink sales fall.  “Relaxation drinks could bring new life into beverages,” said Seifer.  The main ingredients are melatonin, a hormone that is intended to induce drowsiness; L-theanine, an amino acid primarily found in green tea; GABA, a chemical that calms the mind; B vitamins, and chamomile — a plant that often winds up as tea that people drink to help them unwind.  “It gives me a chance to relax from a hard day of work without using something that might land me in jail,” said relaxation drinks consumer Marcus Brook, a Facebook fan of the Drank drink line.  For Denise Ivy, also on Facebook, the drinks helped her cope with the closing of two family businesses: “If it were not for Drank, we would have not gotten any sleep for several weeks.”  Nonetheless, the Zenith report says levels of ingredients in the drinks may be too small to be effective. To move beyond the next 10 years, companies that make the drinks must prove that they do what they say they do, according to Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.  “If the consumer doesn’t feel the effect, then sales would drop off,” said Gorham.

19,KO,Exclusive: Soda makers escalate attacks over obesity,"LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. public awareness campaigns about sugary soft drinks are under legal attack by beverage makers, which have sued New York City’s health department and hit local governments with requests for documents on the science behind the initiatives.  Efforts to deter consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and fatty foods have gained favor in the United States as skyrocketing obesity rates drive up healthcare costs.  The soda industry, which says it is defending its products from “baseless” attacks, and its attorneys have filed at least six document requests with public agencies from California to New York. Anti-obesity advocates say the requests — which can take hundreds of staff hours for cash-strapped governments to satisfy — come from the tobacco industry’s playbook.  “It is, in our opinion, an effort to overwhelm or smother government employees, who already have too much to do,” said Ian McLaughlin, an attorney at the National Policy & Legal Analysis Network to Prevent Childhood Obesity in Oakland, California.  Earlier this month, the American Beverage Association sued New York City’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which has been at the forefront of education efforts in the fight against obesity. The ABA says the city improperly withheld documents it sought through the Freedom of Information Act.  ABA spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said his group made the same request as the New York Times, but that the newspaper received more information than the ABA.  “Public health departments are going out and aggressively misrepresenting our products in advertising and using taxpayer money to do that,” Gindlesperger said.  A New York health department representative did not respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit, which is pending in state court.  Northern California’s Santa Clara County received a letter in May from law firm Latham & Watkins asking for all records relating to its “Rethink Your Drink” education campaign. The law firm, which represents the ABA, sent similar requests to Chicago and Seattle county governments for all writings connected to their sugary-beverage education efforts.  Daniel Peddycord, Santa Clara County’s public health director, stood by his agency’s efforts.  “This is one of the things where the science is really clear ... Americans are consuming far, far, far too much sugar,” Peddycord said.  Roughly two-thirds of adults and one-third of children in the United States are overweight or obese, and rates continue to rise. Obesity contributes to diabetes and other costly chronic diseases.  Each day, the average American adult consumes roughly 22 teaspoons (90 grams), or 355 calories, of added sugars, well above health guidelines. Caloric sweeteners in beverages are a key source of excess calories. New U.S. dietary guidelines recommend drinking water instead sugary drinks.  PepsiCo and Coca-Cola Co declined comment for this story, referring reporters to the ABA.  Food and beverage companies say they are being unfairly singled out.  At various times, states and localities have considered taxing sugary beverages to cover obesity-related health costs. In 2009 and 2010, as such proposals became more frequent, the ABA, Coke and Pepsi collectively spent $60 million on lobbying, up from $8 million in 2007 and 2008, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics’ OpenSecrets.org.  In going after public health campaigns, veterans of the tobacco wars say, the ABA has dusted off an old road map. In the 1990s, tobacco companies embarked on a Freedom of Information effort targeting government agencies receiving federal anti-tobacco money, according to a study by the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health.  Some within the tobacco industry viewed the effort as a way to chill anti-smoking campaigns, the study found.  “The purpose is to stop the staff from doing what they’re actually hired to do,” said Russ Sciandra, advocacy director for the American Cancer Society in New York state.  Matias Valenzuela, public education coordinator for the King County Public Health Department in Seattle, estimated that responding to the ABA’s requests about its sugary beverage education campaign would take 750 hours over nine months.  Gindlesperger said the municipalities are large enough to handle the requests, which are meant to uncover what the ABA claims is shoddy science used in anti-obesity campaigns. The ABA has also requested documents from Philadelphia and the Centers for Disease Control, he said.  In their own bid to stay ahead of anti-obesity efforts, fast-food companies have asked state legislators to limit local government power to regulate restaurants. Arizona, Florida, Alabama and Ohio recently passed so-called preemption laws, another device once used by tobacco companies.  Obesity-related diseases account for nearly 10 percent of U.S. medical spending, or an estimated $147 billion a year.

23,KO,Coke profit surprises; shares touch new high,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) posted slightly better-than-expected earnings on Tuesday on strength in emerging markets such as China and Russia, helping to send its shares up more than 3 percent to a 12-year high.  The world’s largest soft-drink maker, with brands including Sprite, vitaminwater and Powerade, does the majority of its business outside the United States — an asset that has kept it in favor with investors despite home market struggles, where anemic jobs growth has dulled sales of soft drinks.  At the same time, volatility in commodity markets will lead to about $700 million in increased costs this year for things like packaging, sweeteners and fruit.  Atlanta-based Coke said it had raised North American prices 1 percent to 2 percent in the first half of the year, and has already started work on additional increases that should total 2 percent to 3 percent for the year, even though such moves may lead some budget-conscious consumers to cut back.  “There’s no question that the U.S. consumer is still mixed, confused and somewhat apprehensive,” Coke Chief Executive Muhtar Kent told Reuters. “It is incumbent upon business leaders in the world ... to find the algebra for profitable growth .. and you do that through a host of actions.”  Still, Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham said raising prices again could be difficult, given the delicate state of consumer spending following weak U.S. jobs growth in June.  “Pricing should be led by the consumer, but the trouble is the consumer, particularly at the low end, is driven by unemployment, which is back up,” Gorham said. “I just don’t think the environment is right to raise prices.”  Coke shares were up 3.4 percent at $69.40 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They earlier rose as high as $69.45, the highest level since June 1999. Shares of PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, which plans to report its quarterly results on Thursday, gained 0.3 percent.  (For a graphic showing Coke's results and share activity, see: r.reuters.com/gyb72s)  Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management, said the company “continues to execute” in the face of macroeconomic troubles, and as such, he would continue to add to his position in the stock.  “The stock is not dirt cheap but it’s not expensive either. I keep adding to it in a new account, as more money comes in,” Bradshaw said.  Coke also said it plans to buy back at least $2.5 billion in stock by the end of the year, after it suspended buybacks in the second quarter due to discussions it was having regarding a “strategic option” for the company, such as an acquisition. The discussions are no longer happening, Coke said.  “There are always options, but if there are discussions, we’ll stop (buying back shares) again,” Kent said.  Coke reported net income of $2.80 billion, or $1.20 per share for the second quarter that ended on July 1, up from $2.37 billion, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.17 per share, topping analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Revenue jumped 47 percent to $12.74 billion, fueled by last year’s purchase of North American bottling operations, price increases and a 6 percent benefit from foreign exchange rates.  Analysts were expecting revenue of $12.38 billion.  The company said the integration of its bottler was progressing on plan, with 2011 cost savings expected to range from $140 million to $150 million. In addition, the company said its productivity initiatives were on track to slightly exceed its expectations for annual savings of $400 million to $500 million by the end of 2011.  Worldwide volume in the quarter was up 6 percent. North American volume rose 4 percent, driven by the addition of new cross-licensed brands like Dr Pepper. Excluding those brands, volume was flat. That compares with gains of 2 percent in the first quarter, 3 percent in the fourth quarter and 2 percent in the third quarter.  Volume rose 6 percent in Latin America, 5 percent in Europe, 7 percent in the Eurasia and Africa segment and 7 percent in the Pacific region. Volume increased 24 percent in China, 17 percent in Russia and 7 percent in Mexico.

The company, a joint venture between The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Mexico’s Femsa (FMSAUBD.MX), said the cost of goods increased 13.4 percent, mainly due to higher sweetener prices. This was partly offset by the appreciation of local currencies against the U.S. dollar-denominated raw material costs.   In a call with analysts, Coca-Cola Femsa Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino said the company expects sweetener prices to be stable in the second half of the year.   The company is also working on recycling programs that will help reduce its exposure to higher packaging costs, he added.   Quarterly earnings rose to 2.629 billion pesos ($224.5 million) from 2.480 billion pesos a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of 2.62 billion pesos, according to a Reuters survey of five analysts. [ID:nN1E76E1HY]   Revenue rose 12.9 percent to 28.417 billion pesos from 25.176 billion pesos.   The company said sales increased across its portfolio, but particularly in still beverages, where revenue increased 10 percent on demand for juice in Mexico and Brazil.   The bottler recently announced plans to buy the drinks division of Mexican company Grupo Tampico in an all-stock deal. [ID:nN1E75R2AG]   Coca-Cola Femsa shares closed down 0.4 percent at 109.45 pesos. The New York-traded shares fell 0.45 percent to $93.65.

They earlier rose as high as $69.45, the highest level since June 1999. Shares of PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, which plans to report its quarterly results on Thursday, gained 0.3 percent.   (For a graphic showing Coke's results and share activity, see: r.reuters.com/gyb72s)   Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management, said the company “continues to execute” in the face of macroeconomic troubles, and as such, he would continue to add to his position in the stock.   “The stock is not dirt cheap but it’s not expensive either. I keep adding to it in a new account, as more money comes in,” Bradshaw said.   Coke also said it plans to buy back at least $2.5 billion in stock by the end of the year, after it suspended buybacks in the second quarter due to discussions it was having regarding a “strategic option” for the company, such as an acquisition. The discussions are no longer happening, Coke said.   “There are always options, but if there are discussions, we’ll stop (buying back shares) again,” Kent said.   Coke reported net income of $2.80 billion, or $1.20 per share for the second quarter that ended on July 1, up from $2.37 billion, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier.   Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.17 per share, topping analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   Revenue jumped 47 percent to $12.74 billion, fueled by last year’s purchase of North American bottling operations, price increases and a 6 percent benefit from foreign exchange rates.   Analysts were expecting revenue of $12.38 billion.   The company said the integration of its bottler was progressing on plan, with 2011 cost savings expected to range from $140 million to $150 million. In addition, the company said its productivity initiatives were on track to slightly exceed its expectations for annual savings of $400 million to $500 million by the end of 2011.   Worldwide volume in the quarter was up 6 percent. North American volume rose 4 percent, driven by the addition of new cross-licensed brands like Dr Pepper. Excluding those brands, volume was flat. That compares with gains of 2 percent in the first quarter, 3 percent in the fourth quarter and 2 percent in the third quarter.   Volume rose 6 percent in Latin America, 5 percent in Europe, 7 percent in the Eurasia and Africa segment and 7 percent in the Pacific region. Volume increased 24 percent in China, 17 percent in Russia and 7 percent in Mexico.

28,KO,Mexico's Coca-Cola Femsa profit rises 6 percent,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s Coca-Cola Femsa (KOFL.MX) (KOF.N), the largest Coke bottler in Latin America, reported a 6 percent rise in second-quarter profit as higher sales offset rising costs of raw materials.  “Our performance was supported by volume growth across all of our divisions and our ability to implement pricing initiatives over the past several months throughout our main markets,” Chief Executive Officer Carlos Salazar said in a statement.  The company, a joint venture between The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Mexican company Femsa (FMSAUBD.MX), said the cost of goods increased 13.4 percent, mainly due to higher sweetener prices. This was partly offset by the appreciation of local currencies against the U.S. dollar-denominated raw material costs.  Quarterly earnings rose to 2.629 billion pesos from 2.480 billion pesos a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of 2.62 billion pesos, according to a Reuters survey of five analysts.  Revenue rose 12.9 percent to 28.417 billion pesos from 25.176 billion pesos.  The company said sales increased across its portfolio, but particularly in still beverages, where revenue increased 10 percent on demand for juice in Mexico and Brazil.  The bottler recently announced plans to buy the drinks division of Mexican company Grupo Tampico in an all-stock deal.  Coca-Cola Femsa shares closed up 12 centavos at 109.90 pesos in trading in Mexico on Tuesday. The shares are up 7.6 percent since the start of the year.

29,KO,Exclusive: Soda makers escalate attacks over obesity,"LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. public awareness campaigns about sugary soft drinks are under legal attack by beverage makers, which have sued New York City’s health department and hit local governments with requests for documents on the science behind the initiatives.  Efforts to deter consumption of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and fatty foods have gained favor in the United States as skyrocketing obesity rates drive up healthcare costs.  The soda industry, which says it is defending its products from “baseless” attacks, and its attorneys have filed at least six document requests with public agencies from California to New York. Anti-obesity advocates say the requests — which can take hundreds of staff hours for cash-strapped governments to satisfy — come from the tobacco industry’s playbook.  “It is, in our opinion, an effort to overwhelm or smother government employees, who already have too much to do,” said Ian McLaughlin, an attorney at the National Policy & Legal Analysis Network to Prevent Childhood Obesity in Oakland, California.  Earlier this month, the American Beverage Association sued New York City’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which has been at the forefront of education efforts in the fight against obesity. The ABA says the city improperly withheld documents it sought through the Freedom of Information Act.  ABA spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said his group made the same request as the New York Times, but that the newspaper received more information than the ABA.  “Public health departments are going out and aggressively misrepresenting our products in advertising and using taxpayer money to do that,” Gindlesperger said.  A New York health department representative did not respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit, which is pending in state court.  Northern California’s Santa Clara County received a letter in May from law firm Latham & Watkins asking for all records relating to its “Rethink Your Drink” education campaign. The law firm, which represents the ABA, sent similar requests to Chicago and Seattle county governments for all writings connected to their sugary-beverage education efforts.  Daniel Peddycord, Santa Clara County’s public health director, stood by his agency’s efforts.  “This is one of the things where the science is really clear ... Americans are consuming far, far, far too much sugar,” Peddycord said.  Roughly two-thirds of adults and one-third of children in the United States are overweight or obese, and rates continue to rise. Obesity contributes to diabetes and other costly chronic diseases.  Each day, the average American adult consumes roughly 22 teaspoons (90 grams), or 355 calories, of added sugars, well above health guidelines. Caloric sweeteners in beverages are a key source of excess calories. New U.S. dietary guidelines recommend drinking water instead sugary drinks.  PepsiCo and Coca-Cola Co declined comment for this story, referring reporters to the ABA.  Food and beverage companies say they are being unfairly singled out.  At various times, states and localities have considered taxing sugary beverages to cover obesity-related health costs. In 2009 and 2010, as such proposals became more frequent, the ABA, Coke and Pepsi collectively spent $60 million on lobbying, up from $8 million in 2007 and 2008, according to data collected by the Center for Responsive Politics’ OpenSecrets.org.  In going after public health campaigns, veterans of the tobacco wars say, the ABA has dusted off an old road map. In the 1990s, tobacco companies embarked on a Freedom of Information effort targeting government agencies receiving federal anti-tobacco money, according to a study by the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health.  Some within the tobacco industry viewed the effort as a way to chill anti-smoking campaigns, the study found.  “The purpose is to stop the staff from doing what they’re actually hired to do,” said Russ Sciandra, advocacy director for the American Cancer Society in New York state.  Matias Valenzuela, public education coordinator for the King County Public Health Department in Seattle, estimated that responding to the ABA’s requests about its sugary beverage education campaign would take 750 hours over nine months.  Gindlesperger said the municipalities are large enough to handle the requests, which are meant to uncover what the ABA claims is shoddy science used in anti-obesity campaigns. Based on its Freedom of Information request, the New York Times reported in October on an internal dispute within the New York City health department over what claims it could make based on the science regarding sugar intake and weight gain.  The ABA has also requested documents from Philadelphia and the Centers for Disease Control, he said.  In their own bid to stay ahead of anti-obesity efforts, fast-food companies have asked state legislators to limit local government power to regulate restaurants. Arizona, Florida, Alabama and Ohio recently passed so-called preemption laws, another device once used by tobacco companies.  Obesity-related diseases account for nearly 10 percent of U.S. medical spending, or an estimated $147 billion a year. That does not include the cost of lost worker productivity, which is estimated at more than $73 billion a year.  For beverage manufacturers, the issue of obesity is “kind of Armageddon,” said Tom Pirko, an industry consultant.  “What’s happening now is that we’re seeing a much more active industry that’s looking at fighting back now as opposed to just simply trying to make nice.”  ",7202011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-obesity-lobbying/exclusive-soda-makers-escalate-attacks-over-obesity-idUSTRE76I6KI20110720
30,KO,Companies see slack second-half demand,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The economy is lacking in pep heading into the second half of the year. Just ask the head of the company that makes Pepsi.  “The modest pickup in total consumer spending almost all U.S. businesses saw earlier in the year has reversed in the past several months,” Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, said during a conference call on Thursday after the soft-drink and snack company tempered its full-year earnings target.  Her comment echoed those of other consumer products executives, as lingering high unemployment, a stubborn housing market and $4-a-gallon gasoline pressure sales for companies that are also grappling with their own soaring costs for ingredients and raw materials. In the latest data, weekly U.S. jobless claims rose more than expected.  “There’s no question that the U.S. consumer is still mixed, confused and somewhat apprehensive,” Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) Chief Executive Muhtar Kent told Reuters on Tuesday.  Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of the U.S. economy. While higher-income consumers have been more comfortable spending due to gains in their stock portfolios, middle- and lower-income shoppers are still cautious.  “We get fooled because the stock market has been going up ... and that has created a wealth effect for those people who are in the market,” said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo. “But there are so many people who aren’t.”  Russo said spending could come under further pressure as the year progresses, as prices on so many consumer goods go up without any corresponding increase in incomes.  The Dow Jones U.S. Consumer Goods index .DJUSNC was up 0.9 percent on Thursday, underperforming the wider Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX, which was up 1.4 percent in afternoon trading.  Despite the U.S. stock market’s broad rise on Thursday, shares of many consumer products companies were lower. Whirlpool was down 4.2 percent at $72.48, PepsiCo was down 4.5 percent at $65.44 and Safeway was down 8.7 percent at $21.58 in afternoon trading.  The weak recovery is taking its toll on sales of everything from soda to washing machines and other big-ticket items. It even raised the specter of the recent recession.  “Second-quarter industry demand levels were back (at) the same levels we saw at our 2009 recession lows,” Whirlpool (WHR.N) CEO Jeff Fettig told analysts on Thursday  The world’s largest home-appliance maker now expects industry-wide shipments to decline by 1 to 2 percent in the United States this year, down from its prior forecast for a rise of 2 to 3 percent.  Whirlpool is one of many companies being squeezed between higher costs — in this case for steel, copper and oil — and a consumer not able or willing to shell out more to cover those costs.  “Whirlpool is bringing out great products, but I think they might be pricing themselves out of the market ... in this type of market where everything is very volatile,” Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi said.  Ingersoll Rand Plc (IR.N) also reported a lower-than-expected profit on Thursday as demand for home air conditioners remained slack, and U.S. grocery store operator Safeway Inc SWY.N reported weaker-than-expected sales, sending shares down 9 percent.  And consumers still need to get past some new shocks, in the form of additional price increases that have taken their time to move through complex supply chains.  “We’re waiting to see how the second half unfolds as consumers come face-to-face with even higher prices in apparel and footwear,” said VF Corp (VFC.N) CEO Eric Wiseman on a conference call with analysts.  Still, some investors are betting that conditions will improve later this year, as year-over-year commodity inflation eases and Japan recovers from the devastating earthquake and tsunami, which could generate manufacturing jobs in the United States and improve consumer confidence.  “In an aggregate sense, third-quarter economic news ought to be better than second-quarter economic news,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors.  But that may not move the needle by much, so some companies are planning for the pain to continue.  “At current GDP growth rates, they’re not likely to move unemployment by much over the course of the next year or so, so we are expecting things to continue to be challenging,” said PepsiCo Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston.

31,KO,PepsiCo tempers 2011 goal on economy; shares drop,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc PEP.N tempered its full-year outlook on Thursday, citing economic uncertainty, a move that sent its shares down more than 5 percent in their biggest one-day drop since 2008.  The maker of Pepsi-Cola, Frito-Lay snacks and Quaker oatmeal said performance in its North American beverage business was worse than it expected, due to weakened consumer demand and intensifying competition, which has made it difficult to raise prices to offset soaring commodity costs.  “Of the three factors impacting North America beverages — inflation, consumer demand and pricing — the consumer demand picture is the most concerning to us at this point,” Chief Executive Indra Nooyi told analysts on a conference call.  “In fact, the modest pickup in total consumer spending almost all U.S. businesses saw earlier in the year has reversed in the past several months,” she said.  The pain was more acute in the beverage business than the food business, Nooyi said, because consumers have a host of cheaper things to drink, including tap water. That pullback in demand, along with a lack of large price increases from rival Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), led Pepsi to delay its own price increases, since they usually hurt demand further.  The company raised prices on July 11, and said the benefit would be felt more in the fourth quarter than the current third quarter.  Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham said he was not surprised that Pepsi adjusted its outlook.  “This isn’t going to be unusual. People are going to recognize that the third and fourth quarters are going to be more challenging than the first half of the year,” Gorham said.  Pepsi now expects 2011 earnings to grow at a high single-digit rate, from the $4.13 per share it earned in 2010. The new forecast includes a 2 percentage-point boost from foreign exchange rates. Its prior target, for growth of 7 to 8 percent, did not include that boost.  PepsiCo shares were down 4.2 percent at $65.60 on the New York Stock Exchange at mid-afternoon. The last time they fell that much in one day was in December 2008.  PepsiCo said net income in the second quarter ended on June 11 rose to $1.89 billion, or $1.17 per share, from $1.60 billion, or 98 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.21 per share, matching analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Net revenue jumped about 14 percent to $16.83 billion, helped by the recent acquisition of Wimm-Bill-Dann, a Russian drinks company. Analysts were expecting $16.4 billion.  Sales volume rose 10 percent in the snacks business and 5 percent in the drinks business. Volume fell 1 percent in the Americas beverage business and 2 percent at the North American Quaker Foods division. Frito-Lay North America volume rose 2 percent.  In an effort to prevent price increases from hurting sales volume too badly, Pepsi said it will gauge consumers’ reaction to the increases and make adjustments accordingly.  “As such, predicting the ultimate pricing realization for the back half of 2011 is more challenging than it would be in a more stable consumer environment,” said Hugh Johnston, Pepsi’s chief financial officer.  Coke has said it was committed to raising prices by 3 percent to 4 percent in the second half of the year.

The real growth is driven by international,” Kwon said in an interview. Even though Pepsi-Cola just dropped to the No. 3 brand of soft drink in the United States, behind Coca-Cola and Diet Coke, Kwon said “the real investment story is the ability for these companies to grow overseas.”	   She has a “buy” rating on Pepsi and a “strong buy” on Coke, which has a larger international footprint and stronger overall returns due to its concentration in beverages.

But U.S. Federal Trade Commission Chairman Jon Leibowitz said China’s sometimes controversial 2008 anti-monopoly law was a step in the right direction for the country.  “The Chinese anti-monopoly law and its implementation has shown a lot of promise,” he told reporters in Beijing. “It takes a while for any agency to ... hit the institutional sweet spot.”  “We haven’t seen any indication, at least in our interactions, of misuse of anti-trust, in a trade barrier sense,” Leibowitz said.  In 2008, China also rejected buyout giant Carlyle’s $375 million bid for Xugong, China’s biggest construction equipment maker.  Under the law, enterprises with annual revenue of 10 billion yuan ($1.55 billion) globally and 400 million yuan in China must seek government approval for a proposed acquisition.  When asked about cases like that of Coca-Cola and Huiyuan, Leibowitz said: “Any new agency, even one that shows great promise, may have a hiccup or two, but I don’t want to comment on any specific cases.”  “There’s nothing specific that we’ve asked them to change. We just want to help them develop a capability of a mature anti-trust agency; we think they’re mostly on the way.”  Leibowitz is visiting China to sign a Memorandum of Understanding on anti-trust and anti-monopoly cooperation between his department and the U.S. Department of Justice and China’s Commerce Ministry, National Development and Reform Commission and State Administration for Industry and Commerce.  The MoU will see high level consultations, an exchange of information about enforcement and policy and also cooperation on specific cases or investigations, mainly for mergers, he added.  “As we see more deals involving Chinese and American companies, or multinational companies with major Chinese and American presences, we’ll do more work together. That’s a good thing.” ($1 = 6.445 Chinese Yuan)  ",7252011,http://www.reuters.com/article/businesspro-us-china-usa-trade/u-s-says-china-not-abusing-anti-monopoly-law-idUSTRE76O1E820110725

38,KO,Walmart Express hits Chicago,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is opening its first small store in Chicago this week in the first true test of a store format the world’s largest retailer hopes will let it penetrate urban markets that it so far has had trouble cracking.  Wal-Mart will open its first small urban store, less than one-tenth the size of a traditional Walmart, in the city’s Chatham neighborhood on Wednesday.  Four more Walmart Express stores are planned for Chicago, along with three larger Walmart Market stores, which are more like traditional grocery stores, and two more Walmart supercenters. Its first Walmart supercenter opened in 2006.  The Chicago stores, and small stores in Arkansas and North Carolina, are quickly opening up as Wal-Mart tries to reverse two years of declining sales at existing U.S. discount stores.  The chain is trying to win back shoppers, especially those on limited budgets, who have started to do more of their shopping at chains such as Family Dollar Stores Inc FDO.N that pack a variety of food and basic goods into small shops.  “I think it’s fair to say there’s a multibillion dollar growth opportunity in a lot of these cities and Wal-Mart just hasn’t had the right format to penetrate,” said Natalie Berg, global research director at Planet Retail.  The new Walmart Express format is being overseen by Anthony Hucker, vice president of strategy and business development, who is no stranger to opening up small discount shops. Before he joined Wal-Mart, Hucker spent a decade at German deep discount chain Aldi, including time setting up that retailer’s stores in the United Kingdom.  Aldi stocks only its own store branded goods, while Walmart Express has Wal-Mart’s Great Value brand as well as goods from the likes of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N and Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N). Hucker said that people are happy to see brands that they know.  Wal-Mart just started to test the Walmart Express format last month by opening stores in rural parts of Arkansas and North Carolina.  While Wal-Mart is “very, very pleased” with early results from those stores, setting up shop in cities such as Chicago and trying to enter cities such as New York is different.  It costs more to open a store in a city than in a rural area, as rents can be two to three times more expensive, Hucker said as he walked through the new store on Tuesday.  There are also logistical issues to consider, such as dealing with some tighter spaces within the store and traffic when trucks bring in goods, he said.  “If they can’t get the store economics right then the format really doesn’t have a future,” said Berg. “There’s going to be a lot of pressure on keeping costs down.”  Wal-Mart’s heft, with more than 9,200 stores across the globe, is likely to give it an edge over urban competitors.  “They’re the largest retailer in the world, so from a pricing perspective they can compete with anyone,” said Steve Ferrara, partner in the retail and consumer practice at BDO USA in Chicago.  The day before the grand opening, workers were busy loading produce, chips, beer and other goods in the 10,000-square foot store and putting up signs touting locally grown produce.  Wal-Mart is starting to buy more from local companies, a move that highlights its environmental efforts and cuts down on distribution costs. The first items shoppers will see when they enter the store this week are cantaloupes from Illinois’ Frey Farms, as well as mini watermelons.  The store already has some competition, with a new Aldi open nearby and other chains not too far away, such as Walgreen Co WAG.N.  Wal-Mart has just one supercenter in Chicago so far, miles away in the Austin neighborhood. Its next supercenter will open next spring, right in the same shopping area as the new Walmart Express.

39,KO,Walmart Express debuting in Chicago on Wednesday," * Wal-Mart’s first urban small store to open in Chicago   * Plans to open 15 Walmart Express stores this year   By Jessica Wohl   CHICAGO, July 26 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) is opening its first small store in Chicago on Wednesday as it tests a format it hopes will allow it to penetrate urban markets that have resisted its huge stores.

40,KO,Dr Pepper profit beats; stands by 2011 outlook,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc DPS.N posted quarterly profit slightly ahead of Wall Street estimates on Wednesday and stood by its full-year forecast as price increases offset higher ingredient costs.  But the No. 3 U.S. soft drink maker — home to brands such as Sunkist, 7UP and Canada Dry — saw sales volume of its beverage concentrate fall 2 percent in the quarter, a steeper drop than the 0.3 percent decline analysts expected, according to Jefferies analyst Jeff Farmer.  Farmer said the decline was not surprising, given the weak North American performance Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and PepsiCo Inc PEP.N reported last week.  Dr Pepper’s beverage business is concentrated in North America, unlike that of its larger rivals, making it more vulnerable to the region’s wobbling economy and consumer slump.  Dr Pepper shares, which were down 1.6 percent in morning trade, should remain stalled near their current level in the near term, Farmer said in a research note, due to the declining volume, recent market share losses and near peak valuation.  Farmer has a “hold” rating on the shares.  Dr Pepper Snapple said net income fell to $172 million in the second quarter from $183 million a year earlier, due in part to higher selling, general and administrative costs.  On a per-share basis, earnings rose to 77 cents from 74 cents a year earlier, when there were more shares outstanding.  Sales rose 4 percent to $1.58 billion.  Analysts on average expected profit of 76 cents per share and revenue of $1.59 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  The company affirmed its 2011 outlook, which calls for full-year earnings of $2.70 to $2.78 per share on a sales rise of 3 percent to 5 percent.  Based on 2010 sales, that sales target implies full-year sales of $5.81 billion to $5.92 billion.  The company also stood by its forecast for its cost of goods sold to rise 7 percent to 9 percent this year, due mostly to increases in prices for aluminum and juice concentrates.  Dr Pepper shares were down 1.6 percent at $38.99 on Wednesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

46,KO,IFR-Coca Cola claims 2011 low coupon record on 5s and 10s," NEW YORK, Aug 3 (IFR) -  Coca Cola Company (KO.N) set 2011 records today for the lowest coupons on five- and 10-year debt, claiming 1.804% on $1 billion of fives and 3.30% on $1 billion of 10s.  In the five-year market, Coke knocked off a record for five-year money set in July by IBM (IBM.N), which had a 1.95% coupon on a $2 billion deal.  The year’s record low comes amid a rush of companies pricing deals across the maturity spectrum at their lowest funding levels.  Southwestern Public Service Co’s SPS.N $200 million 4.5% 2041s issued today  has tied for the lowest ever 30-year coupon by a corporate. Dominion Resources’s (D.N) $500 million 30-year holding company issue at 4.9% made it to IFR’s top 20 lowest 30-year coupon list this week, as did Public Service Co of Colorado’s $250 million 30-year first mortgage bonds, with the second lowest 30-year coupon in history at 4.75%.  Even BBB-minus rated companies, like Lorillard Tobacco <LO.N,> were able to lock in personal bests at the 30 year end. Lorillard priced a $500 million five-year at 3.5% and during the marketing phase decided to add a $250 million tranche of 30-year bonds, with a coupon of 7% - 1.125% better than the coupon on a 30-year it did last year.  The Barclays Capital US Corporate Index this week hit its lowest yield in 38 years at 3.42%, which is 5bp lower than its previous record of 3.47% reached in November last year. The index has an average maturity of 10.34 years.  Dismal economic news is driving Treasury yields to their tightest this year, and intensified investors’ flight to safe haven high-grade corporate debt, making it a perfect storm for companies looking for funding.  A plunge in the 30-year Treasury yield below the critical 4% level to 3.843%, its lowest since October 2010’s 3.65%, has also led to a flurry of 30-year bond offerings from utilities and corporates this week.  Drivers of the low-yield environment include bad economic news, low dealer inventories for at least two months, a drop in bond issuance in the last two months and inflows - for 30 weeks until this week - into high grade bond funds.  “We are pounding the table telling clients that right now the market is in extremely good shape, despite the negative headlines and their impact on the broader market,” said Rob Kay, managing director and head of investment grade and emerging market debt syndicate at Credit Suisse. “The incredibly favorable technicals  in the market, coupled with the fact that a corporate can lock in all-time low coupons means that if you are not thinking about doing a deal, you should be thinking about one.”  Treasury yields could well go lower in the near future if Friday’s employment figures for July are worse than expected.  Even so, bankers are persuading issuers to come now, rather than later, for the very fact that the rally is based on a more uncertain world, not an improving one.  “Absolute rates are so much lower that certainly an issuer has to take a second look at this market,” said David Trahan, managing director and head of investment grade debt syndicate at Citigroup. “If they are looking at funding later in the year and we are rallying because the world is not a safe place, why would you hesitate?”  Issuers like Coca Cola, as well as scheduled deals being pulled forward are filling the calendar.  “We recommend issuers being more opportunistic when looking to access the capital markets.  Rates and spreads are currently near all-time low levels for many borrowers so capital is available on attractive terms,” said Jim Glascott, head of global debt capital markets at Barclays.   The rally in Treasury yields has coincided with some of the best technicals seen in the market in a year.  Wall Street dealers have kept their inventories low for several months, making it difficult for investors to find any single-A and better rated  corporate paper in the secondary market.  That’s pushed investors into the new-issue market in search of bonds, at a time when earnings season and heightened nerves over European and US sovereign debt has kept many issuers on the sidelines.  “Net supply of investment grade corporate bonds since June 1st has been very light and by some counts, it is actually negative after accounting for fund inflows,” said Rob Stowe, managing director in Barclays Capital’s debt capital markets group.  Issuers also know from experience that windows for issuance can shut quickly.  “We haven’t seen rates at these levels since last November and even then they were only at this level for a three-month period,” said Andrew Karp, managing director and head of investment grade debt syndicate for the Americas at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “Now they are back again and it’s possible that could ignite a new round of accelerated financings.”  That’s resulted in excellent deal execution, with books many times oversubscribed and new issue concessions dropping to what has been close to flat for many trades this week.

49,KO,AriZona Iced Tea partnership ending in legal feud,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Before they co-founded one of the most popular iced-tea brands in the country, John Ferolito and Domenick Vultaggio were just two guys from Brooklyn selling beer out of the back of a Volkswagen bus.  That was in the early 1970s. In 1992, they capitalized on the burgeoning ready-to-drink tea trend with their own line, AriZona Iced Tea, which they sold in distinctive 24-ounce cans for 99 cents.  Today, after years of rapid growth, AriZona is “clearly the biggest successful beverage brand that is still independently owned,” according to John Sicher, editor and publisher of the trade paper Beverage Digest.  In 2010, the company claimed a 33.9 percent share of the ready-to-drink tea market, edging out competition from PepsiCo’s PEP.N Lipton, Coca-Cola’s (KO.N) Nestea and even Dr Pepper Snapple Group’s DPS.N Snapple, according to Beverage Digest.  But the profitable partnership between Ferolito and Vultaggio long ago turned into a messy and hostile legal battle, as the two have repeatedly butted heads.  First, it was over management styles. Then it was over Ferolito’s attempts to strike a multibillion-dollar deal for his half of the company, which pulls in nearly $1 billion annually and employs around 1,000 people, according to court documents.  The dirty laundry from their long-running clash may soon get a public airing, if the latest case between the two men goes to trial as expected later this year or in early 2012, in state Supreme Court in Nassau County, New York.  (The parties are involved in separate litigation in New York county, regarding Vultaggio’s election to buy out Ferolito’s stake in the company.)  The partners are currently awaiting a ruling from Justice Timothy Driscoll over how much of the context of their past relationship can be admitted into the trial, which concerns claims by Vultaggio and Beverage Marketing USA Inc, the family of companies that produce and sell AriZona, that Ferolito breached his agreement to co-finance the company.  In the beginning, Ferolito managed the company’s financial affairs and Vultaggio ran warehouse operations. But in the mid-1990s, Vultaggio decided to move into the front office to better learn the business side of the company.  Their attempts to share an office turned into “a variety of disputes” over matters large and small, according to Ferolito’s court filings. By 1997, they had come to the realization that there could only be “one captain” to steer the ship. Ferolito ceded day-to-day control over the company to Vultaggio and stepped back to pursue other business and leisure interests.  That arrangement kept the peace until 2007, when Ferolito started to explore a sale of his shares in the company to Tata Global Beverages Ltd (TAGL.NS), the world’s second-largest tea manufacturer and distributor.  Tata had valued Ferolito’s half of the company at $2.25 billion, and he said a sale to a major company could help AriZona unlock new global markets and expansion opportunities.  Vultaggio said he was amenable to the talks, until “rumblings” reached him that Ferolito intended to bolster his sale price by selling management rights as well — something Vultaggio considered his under the “one captain” agreement.  After that the gloves came off, both parties contend. Vultaggio and BMU said in court documents that Ferolito attempted to wage “major war” that would aggravate Vultaggio into agreeing to the Tata sale. Vultaggio also accused Ferolito of withholding loans to the company, in violation of a 1992 agreement.  Meanwhile, Ferolito said he had discovered examples of “wrongdoing, self-dealing and improper behavior” on Vultaggio’s part that justified the withholding of the loans. (Ferolito also denies the 1992 agreement is enforceable.)  Ferolito alleged a gamut of “criminal and civil misconduct” by Vultaggio and his associates, including “secretly” putting his sons and other associates on the company payroll, using company funds to buy his wife and others extravagant gifts, and calling Ferolito “evil” at a prayer meeting hosted on company grounds.  “Mr. Vultaggio has now opened a can of worms he surely did not want opened,” said Nicholas Gravante, an attorney with Boies Schiller & Flexner who represents Ferolito.  In a court brief, Vultaggio and BMU’s attorneys called the allegations an attempt to “hijack” the case and turn it into a “confused jumble of mini-trials” over “salacious” and “unsupported” accusations.  “There is an ample record being developed that has all the refutations,” said Louis Solomon, an attorney with Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft who is representing Vultaggio and BMU.  Meanwhile, the vitriol between the co-founders continues unabated. At a hearing last week, attorneys for both Ferolito and Vultaggio asked the court whether they could introduce their respective client’s version of a tense confrontation that occurred at Ferolito’s Florida home in 2007.  Vultaggio alleged that Ferolito made threats that “things were going to change,” including Ferolito’s decision to no longer help finance the company.  Ferolito said he never threatened his partner, but instead told him to “stop running this like it’s a local deli, committing petty crimes. We are a billion-dollar business,” according to a transcript from the hearing.  The parties are due back in court on September 8.  (The case is JMF Consulting Groups II Inc. v.

56,KO,IFR-Treasuries retain safe-haven status as investors flee risk," by Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, Aug 8 (IFR) - Investors fled risk assets en masse on Monday and rushed into US Treasuries, the very securities that were downgraded to AA+ late Friday but still remain the largest, most liquid safe-haven.  The 10-year Treasury note rallied 22bp, sending its yield down to 2.33%, on fears the US and the global economy are headed toward a double-dip recession. Gold, the other key safe-haven asset, soared to $1,710 an ounce by mid-afternoon.  News of the downgrade by Standard & Poor’s hit all risk markets hard, not because it sparked forced selling, but because of expectations it will exacerbate already weak US consumer confidence. For more on the expected impact of the downgrade, see [ID:nN1E76R1IY].  Equities were already in selloff mode last week after a stream of gloomy economic releases. They continued to plunge on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 311.74 points to 11,132.87 at last check.  The IG16 index, a measure of high grade corporate bond secondary levels, gapped out a staggering 7.75bp to 110.5bp, its widest level since mid-September last year. The HY16 index plunged 2.5 points to 94.438, its lowest level in twelve months.  New issue markets almost ground to a halt, with underwriters pulling about six investment grade deals expected to come today.  “The market is falling apart,” said one syndicate head. “Everything is wider in the secondary market. We had as many as four deals ready to go this morning and they all decided to stand down. Bank spreads are out by about 30bp and even the Wal-Marts (WMT.N) and Cokes (KO.N) have widened.”  Bankers and credit strategists view the downgrade of the US AAA rating by just one rating agency as the least of the US’s problems. The weak economy is still the major concern, along with Europe’s ability to deal with its debt crisis without choking off growth. There is also worry that monetary policy and quantitative easing have failed to encourage corporates to expand and create jobs.  “It (the selloff) is a confluence of recent events that has led to an elevated level of volatility and risk aversion,” said Edward Marrinan, chief credit strategist at RBS Securities.  “The downgrade of the US government credit rating, disappointing US economic data and fears that central banks have lost their ability to stimulate economic activity have compounded concerns around Europe’s sovereign debt crisis , prompting a flight to safe haven assets such as Treasuries and gold.”  FINANCIALS SLAMMED  RBS economists, like many on Wall Street, have revised their outlook for US economic growth downward. RBS is now forecasting a 2.4% growth rate for the second half and into 2012, compared with an earlier forecast of 3.2%.  “The problem of low GDP growth is that there is little cushion to absorb unexpected shocks to the economy; this raises the risk of a double dip recession,” said Marrinan.  The highest quality corporate bonds are expected to tighten as investors regain some calm and move back into the best A, AA and AAA names.  But if economic data continues to worsen, investors will have to factor in the possibility that top quality corporates will also be hurt.  Those concerns are behind the widening of yield spreads on top quality bonds today. Coca-Cola’s five- and 10-year bonds, issued last week, were barely wider from new issue spread, but had lost all of their after-market gains. The company’s 2021s, issued at 72 bp, were trading around 73bp at midday today, from as tight as 65bp last week.  The financial institutions group (FIG) space continued to be the hardest hit. The S&P financial stock index lost 8.3% of its value, and spreads of the biggest US banks widened as much as 30bp.  Even bank debt guaranteed by the government’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program widened about 3bp-10bp on news of the downgrade.  Bank of America (BAC.N) was worst hit, after AIG (AIG.N) brought a $10bn lawsuit against the bank, alleging massive fraud on mortgage debt. The bank’s 5% of 2021s were trading at 309bp over Treasuries, out from 260bp last Friday and a May new issue spread of 185bp.  “The market is looking ahead and risk of recession has increased, and a recession with a very low 10-year bond yields is very detrimental to the financials,” said Frederick Cannon, senior bank analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  Even the top quality FIG names like General Electric (GE.N) were hard hit. GE’s 5.265% 2021s, rated AA+, were trading at 185bp over Treasuries, from 165bp on Friday.  JP Morgan (JPM.N) bonds were also wider. The A+ rated 4.35% of 2021s, issued on August 3 at a yield spread of 175bp over Treasuries, were trading at 206bp today.  Some strategists are not expecting risk aversion to dissipate until there are solid signs of economic improvement in the US.  With the 10-year Treasury yielding 2.37%, however, credit investors aren’t expected to sit in Treasuries for too long.  “I’m still pretty sanguine on the high yield market, “ said a senior portfolio manager at one of the biggest asset management firms.  “High yield has cheapened up quite a bit, while the spread rally in Treasuries has out-weighed the spread widening in high grade corporates, meaning overall yield in that market is lower,” he said.  “That’s resulted in an explosion in the gap between triple-B and double-B yields.”  (Reporting by IFR senior reporter Danielle Robinson; Tel: 1-646-223-6141: Editing by Ciara Linnane)  (danielle.robinson@thomsonreuters.com; Reuters messaging; danielle.robinson.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))  For queries regarding this report, please contact ifrmarkets@thomsonreuters.com)  For other related fixed-income quotations, stories and guides to Reuters pages, please double click on the symbol:  U.S. corporate bond price quotations...NASDBONDS  U.S. credit default swap column........[CDV/]  U.S. credit default swap news..........[CDV]  European corporate bond market report..[EUB/]  European corporate bond market report..[EUB/]  Credit default swap guide..............CDSINDEX  Fixed income guide......BONDS  U.S. swap spreads report...............[SWP/]  U.S. Treasury market report............[US/]  U.S. Treasury outlook...[US/0]  U.S. municipal bond market report......[MUNI/] ",8082011,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-credit/ifr-treasuries-retain-safe-haven-status-as-investors-flee-risk-idUSN1E7771CW20110808

University of Southern California has completed a US$300m offering of century bonds, and Mexico was out to reopen and double the size of the 100-year security it priced in October last year.  Both deals priced without a sizeable spread difference from typical 30-year money. Investors were generally happy to take on the longer maturity in exchange for more yield in a relatively safe credit.  The issuers saw plenty of evidence that this was the week to take home cheap capital. The roiling equity markets notwithstanding, the debt capital markets have been stable and amenable to new issuance.  The two-year Treasury note changed hands this afternoon at 0.188%, down 9.2bp from the close last Friday, several hours before S&P announced its one-notch downgrade of the US sovereign.  Over the same period, five-year notes have lost 25.9bp, and out on the curve, the 10-year and the 30-year have lost 39.1bp and 24.3bp, respectively.  Mexico’s original US$1bn 5.75% bond last year, its debut in the maturity, was already the largest century debt on record, and today they hit the market for another US$1bn. Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs launched the deal at 96.5. They priced the bonds to yield 5.959%, or 241.8bp over 30-year Treasuries.  Though some questioned the logic of Mexico pricing a 100-year bond last year, the 5.75% coupon it achieved at the time was tighter than on its existing bonds due 2040, which pay out 6.05%.  USC, for its part, has never priced a century bond, though universities have been some of the most active in the space in the US. This afternoon Aa1/AA rated USC took home US$300m in 100-year money.  The trade priced at par with a 5.25% coupon to yield 174bp over the 4.75% Treasury bond due 2041. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley led the trade. The proceeds will be used to support the university’s capital plans and/or to refinance existing debt.  The last university to price a century bond was the Triple A rated Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT, on May 11 2011. That US$750m offering, also the subject of low yields, printed with a 5.60% coupon to yield 130bp over the 30-year Treasury bond. This morning MIT bonds were quoted at 115bp/105bp.  The most recent 100-year trade, however, came from Norfolk Southern, a Baa1/BBB+/BBB rated transportation company. On May 18 this year it upsized an US$250m tranche to US$400m, through Morgan Stanley, and priced it with a 6.00% coupon at par. It printed at a 175.2bp premium to 4.75% 30-year bonds due February 2041.  Indeed, Norfolk has been one of the more active borrowers in the tenor over the past decade, but it has had company. Disney was the first issuer ever to print a 100-year bond, when it priced a US$300m fundraising on July 21 1993.  A day later, Coca-Cola, still one of the most favored issuers in the high-grade space, priced a US$150m deal.  Since then, the list of issuers is relatively long, including Yale University, Union Pacific, IBM, Chrysler and Caterpillar.  But deal pace fell off quickly after May 1998 when Coke returned for a US$250m trade. Since then there have been nine deals, including today’s trade. In total, there have been about 60 century deals, according to IFR data.  ",8102011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-credit/century-bonds-resurface-as-yields-dive-idUSTRE77961A20110810

59,KO,Junk food still star in TV ads seen by children: study," NEW YORK, Aug 10 (Reuters Life!) - Children in the United States are seeing fewer sugary, fatty foods advertised on TV, but unhealthy fare still accounts for most of the food ads they see — and fast food commercials were more numerous in 2009 than six years before, a study said.	   The U.S. food industry in 2006 began a voluntary program called the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI) in response to calls from the Federal Trade Commission and the Institute of Medicine for greater self-regulation of food advertising to children.	   The study, reported in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, assessed the impact of the program, which 17 companies — including Coca-Cola, Kraft Foods, General Mills and Kellogg — have joined, pledging to improve the nutritional content of the ads they run during programs geared mainly for children under 12.	   “Overall, fewer of these (unhealthy) products were being advertised, which is good news,” said Lisa Powell, a researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who led the study.	   “On the other hand, we saw a large increase in the number of fast-food ads.”	   The extent to which advertising is to blame for childhood obesity is controversial, but there is evidence that commercials may affect children’s hunger for junk food. One recent study found that children watching cartoons consumed 45 percent more snacks when they were exposed to food ads.	   The study looked not only at ads aired during children’s programs, but all commercials seen by the under-12 set, based on Nielsen ratings data.	   By 2009, children were seeing fewer high-fat, high-sugar or high-sodium foods in TV ads, compared with 2003. But the bulk of 2009 ads, at 86 percent, were for fatty, sugary or salty products — down from 94 percent in 2003.	   Children also saw roughly one third more fast-food commercials in 2009.	   Powell said the results raise questions about the extent to which self-regulation of ads during children’s programming can “change the landscape” of food marketing to children.	   Lee Peeler, a spokesperson for the Council of Better Business Bureaus, which runs the CFBAI, said the study shows that progress has been made.	   But he took issue with the fact that the study looked at all ads seen by children, rather than ads aired during children’s programming, which are the focus of the CFBAI initiative.	   “They didn’t use the right measure of industry self-regulation,” he added.	   He also said that researchers only looked at the number of fast-food ads and not the content, noting that two giants of the industry — Burger King and McDonald’s, both of which are CFBAI members — have improved their children’s meals and the ads for them, offering things such as apple slices and low-fat milk instead of French fries and soda.	   Powell said that the CFBAI has made some recent changes that could be for the better, such as announcing that it had developed uniform nutrition criteria, based on U.S. dietary guidelines, for foods that can be advertised to children.	   The uniform criteria will go into effect in 2014 and include standards such as limiting advertised children’s cereals to 10 grams of sugar per serving, down from the 12 grams companies are holding themselves to now.	   Currently, companies are able to create their own standards.	   “We may well see some improvements in the future,” Powell said, noting that parents need to be aware that junk foods still feature heavily in TV ads.	   ""Time will tell. We'll have to keep monitoring this.""

By the end of 2011, Coca-Cola and its China bottling partners would have invested more than $3 billion in the country over the last three years, bringing the total investment to $7 billion by the end of 2014.  “China is one of our most important growth markets in the world,” said Muhtar Kent, Coca-Cola’s chief executive, in a statement.  “The new investment is a part of our long-term commitment to invest in innovation, partnerships and a portfolio that will enable us to grow our business in a sustainable and responsible way,” Kent said.  Kent told Xinhua in an interview that the investment will be used to expand the company’s product lines, infrastructure and distribution systems as well as invest in cold drinks equipment.  Coca-Cola said sales in China topped 1 billion unit cases in the first six months of the year, double the rate five years ago.  The firm also said it opened one bottling plant already this year and will open one more bottling plant and break ground by the end of 2011. Coca-Cola opened five plants in China from 2009 to 2010.

64,KO,CORRECTED: Spreads widen as corp bonds lag Treasuries,"NEW YORK, Aug 24 (IFR) - While corporate bond coupons have been shrinking fast, they haven’t been able to keep pace with the precipitous decline of Treasury rates.  As a result, the difference between corporate and Treasury yields — a key measure of high-grade bond investment risk — is wider than it has been all year. Yet corporate bonds, with the exception of banks, aren’t that much riskier.  Witness the option adjusted spread (OAS) between Treasuries and corporate bonds in the Barclays investment grade corporate index: closing at 2.12% on Tuesday, it is wider than it has been in more than a year and a half (see chart). Last Friday it breached the 2.00% mark for the first time since December 3 2009, when it closed at 2.03%.  For a chart of the OAS for all corporates and financials, please see:  r.reuters.com/jyf43s Yesterday’s close was about 76bp wider than this year’s low of 1.36%. Reached on April 11, the low close came on a day when Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) took home US$5bn in a four-part trade, including low coupon records, and the 10-year Treasury note finished with a 3.59% yield.  Yesterday, the benchmark note closed at 2.15%, tighter than April by a whopping 144bp.  All of this means that though corporate bond yields have been falling fast, they have not caught up to Treasury yields, which have been changing hands near record lows. Industrial corporations in general are not underperforming, however. Quite the contrary: conservative business strategies since the credit crisis and record amounts of balance sheet cash has made them prime targets for debt investors.  “Despite increased risk aversion and broader economic weakness, credit fundamentals look pretty strong,” said Shobhit Gupta, credit strategist at Barclays Capital.  The main offender pushing the Barclays index wider is the financial sector, which comprises about 35% of the constituent securities. Usually more volatile than the overall index — especially during the credit crisis — financials finished Tuesday with a 2.93% OAS. The spread is subdivided into 2.87% for intermediate maturity financial bonds and the widest subsector in the financial index, 3.23% for long-dated securities.  “The move is extreme for banks,” an analyst said. “They have widened more than 100bp since the beginning of July.”  Over the same period the entire corporate index, including financials, widened about 55bp. Industrial credits, including big consumer borrowers like Coke (KO.N) and Pepsi PEP.N, but excluding utilities and banks, gapped out only about 35bp in the period.  Since the credit crisis, the financial space has been the most volatile and had a wider spread than the index as a whole. What’s more, the difference between financials and the entire index is growing. On April 11, when the corporate index had its low close this year of 1.36%, the financial component finished the day at 1.61%, for a 25bp spread differential. However, yesterday, the difference between spreads was 81bp.  Treasury yields, for their part, haven’t been any less precarious. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has been all over the place this month, closing trading as high as 2.77% on August 1, and as low as 2.07% last Friday.  But the industrial space is not so immune. Airlines and home construction companies, two important economic indicators, are generally lagging other non-financials. In the index airlines account for only 19 bonds and US$8.5bn, Gupta said. Those credits are standout laggards, nonetheless.  Yields on financial names, mostly banks, are most responsible for making spreads fatter. The sector is getting trounced in equities and bonds. Not only is the European banking crisis weighing down US firms, but protracted uncertainty around Bank of America (BAC.N) this week, for example, is also an albatross.  Within the financial space, there are some exceptions. Look no further than yesterday’s new issue from John Deere Capital Corp (DE.N), which provides retail financing for new John Deere equipment.  Though not subject to the same market forces as the US banking system, it’s still a financial name and treated as such. However, it was able to print a US$500m, five-year trade yesterday with zero new-issue concession. The trade finished with a 1.85% coupon, not very far from the tightest coupon ever for the maturity, and priced to yield Treasuries plus 95bp.  Credit spreads won’t always be this wide, especially if Treasury yields continue to increase as they are today (with the 10-year up more than 10bp this afternoon). And rising yields will be better for spread and yield investors.  Persistently low Treasury yields have slowed down the recovery in spreads.  “What low yields have done is make the recovery not as swift as it would be if Treasury rates were at more reasonable levels,” Barclays’ Gupta said. “You need a little more stability and an increase in yield for spreads to tighten again.”  Nonetheless, the comparably wide spreads on financials make them generally attractive for investors.  “Financials, including banks, are getting to levels that are attractive but for the volatility,” he said.

65,KO,US Labor Day soda prices up from last year-report," * Soda prices up more than expected - analyst   * Still instances of deep discounting   * Beer prices up to a smaller degree   NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - U.S. advertised soda prices are up more than expected for the Labor Day holiday weekend, according to a survey, which bodes well for profits at Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), PepsiCo Inc PEP.N and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc DPS.N.   For all three companies, the average advertised price for 2-liter bottles and 12-pack cans are higher going into the holiday weekend than a year ago, according to a report by ConsumerEdge Research.   “Our expectation was for more aggressive pricing for the last holiday of the summer, but that doesn’t seem to have materialized,” said ConsumerEdge analyst Bill Pecoriello. “Given the maniacal focus on U.S. (carbonated soft drink) pricing, this should be a positive data point for the companies.”   The average price of a 2-liter bottle of soda is up 18 percent from last year for Coca-Cola brands, 12 percent for Pepsi brands, and 9 percent for Dr Pepper Snapple. For the 12-packs, Coca-Cola prices are up 6 percent, Pepsi 15 percent and Dr Pepper 8 percent.   Still, Pecoriello said there were instances of deep discounts, such as 12-packs of Coke for $2.22, Pepsi for $2.00 and Dr Pepper brands for $2.40.   For example, shoppers at Jewel-Osco stores in Illinois can buy four packages of Coca-Cola products — including a 12-pack of 12 oz. cans, a 6-pack of 24 oz. bottles or an 8-pack of 12 oz. bottles — for $9, which works out to about $2.25 for a 12-pack. Jewel-Osco is owned by Supervalu Inc (SVU.N).   For beer, Pecoriello said mainstream brands were up at low single-digit rates, with high-end beer prices little changed from a year ago.   Budweiser, made by Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), and Miller, made by the MillerCoors joint venture of SABMiller Plc SAB.L and Molson Coors Brewing Co (TAP.N), are both up about 1 percent, while Coors is up about 3 percent, Pecoriello said.

66,KO,UPDATE 2-Coke bottler backs down on France tax protest plan,"   * Company will go ahead with France investment -exec   * Apologises for “communication error”   * Threat had led to backlash from politicians  (Recasts with Coca-Cola Enterprises’ changing stance on plans to protest a proposed French tax on soft drinks, adds apology by executive, other details)   PARIS, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Enterprises CCE.N backed down from threats of a symbolic protest against a proposed French tax on soft drinks late Thursday evening, with a top executive apologising for a “communication error.”   The company, which distributes Coke across Europe, will go ahead with plans to inject 17 million euros ($24 million) into its plant in southern France, its European head told French television, despite an earlier statement that it was reviewing the project to protest against the tax.   Coca-Cola Enterprises will also proceed with a party to celebrate the 40-year anniversary of the plant, though the date is not fixed yet, added Hubert Patricot, president of the European Group, Coca-Cola Enterprises.   Earlier on Thursday the company said it had cancelled the festivities, planned for Sept. 19, saying the proposed tax unfairly singled out its products.   “We regret the communication error made this morning by our French team, which spread confusion about Coca-Cola’s commitments in France,” Patricot told news channel LCI.   “We confirm our investment of 17 million euros in our plant at Pennes-Mirabeau ... We will celebrate its 40th anniversary.”   CCE also issued a statement reconfirming its commitment to France but said it still strongly opposed the “unjust” tax.   The embarrassing climbdown came after several French lawmakers and Labour Minister Xavier Bertrand criticised Coca-Cola Enterprises’ threat, using words such as “blackmail.”   Last month, France announced a set of austerity measures aimed at securing challenging deficit-reduction goals.   As part of the package, it announced a new tax on soft drinks as well as additional taxes on strong liquor and plans to raise tobacco prices.   Coca-Cola Enterprises, Western Europe’s biggest bottler of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) drinks, has five production sites in France where it employs around 3,000 people. The Les Pennes-Mirabeau plant near Marseille employs 203.

67,KO,Analysis: AOL's Armstrong feeling the heat with Project Devil,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Forget the Michael Arrington sideshow — AOL boss Tim Armstrong has a bigger problem, involving the “Project Devil” advertising unit.  Project Devil, which is a large-ad format with interactive panels that dominate a Web page, is still striving to gain traction among ad buyers since its glitzy debut during New York Advertising Week last September. The problem is that other websites have been slow to embrace the platform, one of Armstrong’s main initiatives to boost advertising revenue.  “Project Devil has a lot of positive qualities,” said Tracey Scheppach, founder of The Pool, at the digital agency VivaKi. “The hard part is finding people to use the unit.”  The sluggish uptake for Project Devil could only hamper AOL’s strategy under Armstrong to lessen its dependence on its fast-dwindling but lucrative dial-up business. AOL aims to do that by becoming a leading content destination on the Web, backed mainly by advertising revenue.  Project Devil’s slow start adds more pressure on Armstrong, who took over a struggling AOL and since has grasped at several strategies, including splashy acquisitions — the Huffington Post, TechCrunch — and ambitious projects like Patch.  AOL has also been through several staff shake-ups, the last of which was an overhaul of its ad sales department and the ouster of its top salesman in July.  His latest headache involves TechCrunch founder Arrington and a controversial venture capital fund launched by Arrington and backed by AOL. Questions linger whether Arrington is still employed by AOL, given the protests about the fund’s ability to invest in companies covered by TechCrunch.  Hailed as AOL’s savior only two years ago, Armstrong, could find himself on the hotseat if he fails to convince Wall Street that he finally has the Internet company on the right course.  Indeed, Carol Bartz’s ouster as Yahoo’s CEO serves as a cautionary tale for Armstrong. Her departure was precipitated, in part, by her failure to maintain Yahoo’s leadership position in display advertising.  In August, AOL reported second-quarter results that disappointed investors mainly because of weak display ad revenue growth, which forced the company to trim its operating profit outlook for the year. AOL shares plunged more than 30 percent on the news.  Part of the issue with Project Devil is that advertisers, who are pleased with the format, are reluctant to spend money building out a custom ad that only runs on AOL, said David Cohen, global digital officer at the ad agency UM. He added that he is a big advocate and partner of AOL and its efforts.  However, a handful of publishers including Hearst Magazines, the Wall Street Journal Digital Network, Meredith Corp and FoxNews.com have agreed to use the format on their own sites. Meredith, which publishes magazines such as Better Homes and Gardens and Ladies Home Journal, is still rolling out the ad units on its properties, for instance.  Rich Kim, vice president and associate media director at the ad agency RPA, thinks that about 100 of the top sites on comScore need to adopt the format before it can take off fully. Otherwise, he said, it becomes too costly to produce and place an ad that can’t reach a broad audience.  “I think (AOL) is on the right track,” said Kim. “I just wish something like this could be leveraged elsewhere as a more a cost effective solution for my clients. Right now it is hard justify.”  Plus, broad adoption could backfire, notes Michael Hays, president of digital communications worldwide at the ad firm Initiative. “As it becomes a standard size in theory, I don’t have to purchase that from AOL anymore and I can still get the bang from my buck,” he said.  CATCH-22  AOL has been pushing Project Devil on Madison Avenue and with other publishers and websites over the past year. But while the unit allows more of the innovation advertisers are seeking in their ads, it is not attracting enough eyeballs.  “What agencies are looking for is a broader canvas, and Project Devil gives us creative prowess,” said Vik Kathuria, managing partner at Mediacom. “At the same time we look for reach. Unfortunately, that is where they fall behind the pack,” he said, ticking off sites such as Facebook and Google’s YouTube as places that command bigger audiences than AOL.  The company is currently hosting 11 campaigns from the likes of Coca-Cola Co, Procter & Gamble Co, and Kraft Foods Inc that are using the unit. Armstrong pointed out during AOL’s earnings call in early August that consumers spend almost four times as long on a page with a Project Devil ad compared with industry averages.  One of the difficulties Project Devil faces involves getting websites used to the idea of replacing several smaller ads with one big ad on the page. “The commercial trade-off is that sites are going to sell one beautiful big ad as opposed to three or four small ads. That takes some courage,” said Peter Minnium, consulting director for industry group the Interactive Advertising Bureau.  The IAB gave AOL a huge vote of confidence when it named Project Devil one of its “Rising Stars.”  “It’s still early days,” the UM agency’s Cohen said. “If this is a marathon, they are probably in mile three or four.

71,KO,PepsiCo shakes up North America drinks unit,"(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc PEP.N announced a shake-up of its beverages unit on Wednesday, appointing a new head to try to turn around the business, which has lagged behind Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) in North America.  Pepsi named Albert Carey, a 30-year PepsiCo veteran who most recently ran its Frito-Lay North America unit, to be CEO of PepsiCo Americas Beverages, effective immediately.  Carey, 60, will take over responsibility for all aspects of the beverage business in the Americas, including the North American bottlers that PepsiCo bought in 2010.  Carey’s new role essentially combines those of Eric Foss, the former CEO of the bottler, and Massimo d’Amore, whose tenure as Americas beverage chief has been marked by several successes and one large misstep.  “PepsiCo has been underperforming Coke in North American beverages and now they’ve completely revamped their structure and management,” said John Sicher, publisher of industry newsletter Beverage Digest. “I don’t know whether this will improve their performance, but Carey is one of the strongest executives at PepsiCo.”  Coca-Cola, which acquired its North American bottling operations after Pepsi did, still has a separate bottling manager in North America.  Foss — former CEO of Pepsi Bottling Group, which PepsiCo acquired last year — will leave the company in December. His eventual departure was expected following the integration of the bottler.  Foss, 53, plans to take a senior leadership role at a public company, PepsiCo said. A spokesman could not provide further details.  PepsiCo shares were up $1.27, or 2.1 percent, at $61.81 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange.  In the most recent quarter, North American drink sales volume fell 1 percent for PepsiCo. At Coke it was flat, excluding a boost from new cross-licensed brands like Dr Pepper.  Carey’s promotion marks a partial demotion for d’Amore, who has run the Americas beverage business since November 2007. While his tenure saw the launches of various lines of Gatorade and the lower-calorie Trop 50 juice drinks, he is most often associated with a failed redesign of Tropicana Pure Premium juice packaging that was scrapped less than two months after its launch due to a plunge in sales.  “Although Foss’s departure likely suggests continuing struggles in North America beverages ... we see the other management changes as likely longer-term positives for the stock,” said Bernstein Research analyst Ali Dibadj, who described d’Amore as being “oft-criticized.”  D’Amore will retain responsibility for Gatorade and Tropicana in North America and the Latin American drink business, and will report to Carey. He will also remain head of the “global beverages group,” which focuses on innovation, research and development and global brand management. In that role, he will continue to report to PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi.  Tom Greco will succeed Carey as head of Frito-Lay North America.  The fact that PepsiCo is tapping a Frito-Lay executive to run the drink business raises concerns over the depth of its management bench on the drink side, according to Credit Suisse analyst Carlos Laboy.  “We believe that this is not inconsequential, given the competencies necessary to run a North American beverage business have traditionally involved intensive marketing, innovation and great franchise relationship skills, whereas the snack business has been more of a push-driven model,” Laboy said.

The company is also introducing a smaller 12.5-ounce bottle that will sell for 89 cents, building on the success of a 16-ounce bottle priced at 99 cents.  “Refreshment is not about gluttony,” said Sandy Douglas, president of Coca-Cola North America, at a gathering of analysts and investors in Houston. “We’re not addicted to supersizing to drive our model.”  By selling a 12.5-ounce bottle for 89 cents, Coke is now able to raise the price on its 16-ounce bottle, which will help profit margins. Coke said the price of the 16-ounce bottle would go up to about $1.19 over the next few months.

78,KO,UPDATE 2-HKEx CEO expects China investors can buy HK stocks soon," * Mainland investment in HK stocks to lift int’l listings - Li   * Trading in yuan-linked derivatives to provide big opportunities   (Adds comments, details on retail investors, derivatives)	   By Elzio Barreto	   HONG KONG, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd expects mainland Chinese investors to be allowed to invest in Hong Kong-listed shares soon, stoking a boom in the bourse’s business and drawing more international listings to the financial centre, Chief Executive Charles Li said on Wednesday.	   The “first chapter” of growth for the exchange was from the wave of listings in recent years by Chinese companies, Li added, with future growth coming from Chinese investment flows to the exchange and the launch of currency and interest rate derivatives linked to the yuan.	   “Our chapter 2 is to bring Chinese investors here and that in turn will attract a lot of international companies,” he said during an event organised by the Asia Society.	   Asked when that might happen, Li added: “I know physics and there is a lot of water building up there.”	   “I know that water is coming down pretty soon,” Li said of the wall of funds expected from Chinese retail investors.	   Chinese mainland investors would be allowed to access Hong Kong capital markets through exchange-traded funds, Vice-Premier Li Keqiang said last month. He did not give a time-frame for the development. 	   China , the world’s second-largest economy, keeps its capital account on a tight leash and Hong Kong has been identified as Beijing’s test bed for any cautious relaxation of capital controls. 	   As part of several measures to liberalise use of the yuan, also called renminbi, more countries could start using it in global trade in coming years, with businesses also expected to increasingly use the currency when doing business with China. That in turn would create the need for financial derivatives linked to the yuan.	   “In the next 10 years, internationalization of the renminbi is going to be a constant theme of the global economy,” Li said.	   “As part of that trend, one of the major opportunities to come out of it is financial derivatives, whether it’s forex or interest rates, those derivatives will be definitely exchange-traded and hopefully with the bond market thriving in China and in the region, I think there will be massive opportunities there.”	   He downplayed concerns that Hong Kong, the top global destination for initial public offerings (IPOs) for two years running, would be hurt by a surge in listings in Shanghai, once China allows implementation of the international board for multinational companies such as HSBC  and Coca Cola .	   Talk of a Shanghai international board has been around for almost a decade, but it has been delayed many times over problems ranging from worries about hot money inflows to the global financial crisis.	   Even if Hong Kong loses out some listings to Shanghai, Li expects a surge in trading volumes and investment flows from Chinese retail investors to more than make up the losses as China liberalises use of the yuan. With nearly 100 million retail accounts in its top two exchanges, China could provide plenty of capital for Hong Kong.	   “Everyone is saying, if China opens, Charles, you’re done, you’re finished because Shanghai and Shenzhen will take over. We won’t be finished because when capital accounts open, it’s never going to open one way,” Li said.	   “We can lose a significant portion of our market, let’s say if everybody goes up North,” he added. “We only need a small portion from the domestic population of investors before we can make it up. Clearly we will be the net beneficiary of this opening.”	 	  (Editing by Chris Lewis and Muralikumar Anantharaman)	  	  ",9212011,http://www.reuters.com/article/hkex/update-2-hkex-ceo-expects-china-investors-can-buy-hk-stocks-soon-idUSL3E7KL0WZ20110921
79,KO,UPDATE 3-RESEARCH ALERT-Stifel cuts PepsiCo to 'hold',"   * Cuts EPS estimates as N. Amer drinks unit view worsens   * Says PepsiCo shares are a value trap   * Bernstein names potential suitors of PepsiCo’s food unit   * PepsiCo shares down 1 pct  (Adds companies declining to comment; updates shares)   Sept 23 (Reuters) - Stifel Nicolaus downgraded PepsiCo Inc PEP.N shares to “hold” from “buy,” saying its view on the leadership, culture and outlook for the company’s North America beverages unit has degraded in recent months.   “We had maintained a ‘buy’ on valuation but now believe PepsiCo shares are a value trap,” analyst Mark Swartzberg said in a note to clients on Friday.   Pepsico had no comment about the downgrade.   PepsiCo shares, which have fallen 15 percent from mid-May through Thursday’s close, closed down another 1 percent at $60.34 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.   Also on Friday, Bernstein Research sent a note to clients speculating on potential suitors for PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay snack business, were it ever up for sale.   Many on Wall Street have been speculating on a potential break-up of PepsiCo, given the company’s languishing stock price and similar announcements by Fortune Brands Inc FO.N, Sara Lee Corp SLE.N and Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N.   Bernstein said Kraft’s soon-to-be-separated snacks unit, Kellogg Co (K.N), General Mills Inc (GIS.N) and possibly Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) could be interested in acquiring PepsiCo’s food business, which includes Lays potato chips and Tostitos corn chips.   Pepsico reiterated on Friday previous comments about the present makeup of its company. The company has said it believes in the power of its diverse portfolio.   Coca-Cola, General Mills and Kraft officials said they do not comment on market rumors or speculation. A Kellogg official was not immediately available.   Stifel Nicolaus cut its fourth-quarter and 2012 earnings estimates on the maker of Pepsi-Cola, Frito-Lay snacks and Quaker oatmeal by 1 cent and 10 cents respectively, to reflect lower volume and margin estimates for PepsiCo North America Beverages, which has lagged rival Coca-Cola Co.   “Leadership, culture, and the outlook for North America Beverages are top concerns among investors,” Swartzberg said.   Earlier this month, PepsiCo announced a shake-up of the PepsiCo Americas Beverages unit, appointing 30-year PepsiCo veteran Albert Carey to turn around the business.

The world’s largest soft-drink maker, whose brands include Sprite, vitaminwater and Powerade, unveiled goals two years ago to double revenue to roughly $200 billion, with profit margins increasing and a more than doubling of soft drink servings sold.	   Coke’s CEO Muhtar Kent, who was in Ireland last week to open a new flavourings factory in the south-east of the country, told the Irish Times newspaper in an interview that the plan was “on track right now.”	   “It’s only the beginning of the journey but I’d rather be on track and ahead rather than be behind in the middle of a very challenging macro environment,” the newspaper quoted Kent as saying	   “We had no idea we would be entering into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.”	   The Irish Times added that the CEO of the Atlanta-based company was untroubled by talk of a double-dip recession in the United States and Europe. 	   “All it means to me if it happens is that the recovery is going to take a little longer,” Kent said.	   “I do know there’s going to be a recovery, I do know that there will be a 800 (million) to 1 billion-strong new middle class coming to the world in the next 10 years.

Paulo newspaper reported.   FIFA has asked Brazil to suspend several laws while it hosts the World Cup, including one that requires theatrical and sports events to provide half-price tickets to people over 65, the paper reported on Saturday.   The laws, FIFA says, threaten to increase the governing body’s costs, reduce its ability to protect its brands and sponsors’ trademarks and to saddle FIFA with other legal liabilities, Estado said, citing Orlando Silva, Brazil’s sports minister.   Rousseff plans to meet FIFA President Joseph Blatter in Brussels on Monday and is ready to compromise on a series of FIFA complaints, Silva told the newspaper.   They include some prohibitions on alcohol sales and rules that grant low-cost tickets to students and youth, the newspaper said. She won’t suspend the Elderly Persons’ Statute or consumer protection laws, it reported.   Rousseff’s office would not confirm or deny a meeting. Brazil’s sports ministry and FIFA’s media department did not return phone calls Saturday.   FIFA’s complaints come after criticism of delays in the construction or repair of stadiums and the expansion of public transport facilities for the World Cup.

The World Cup Bill being debated in Congress, for example, fails to provide sufficient penalties to companies and individuals who sell pirate goods or infringe trademarks, it said, citing Silva.

86,KO,DealTalk: PepsiCo should consider the Power of Two,"PHILADELPHIA/NEW YORK (Reuters) - While PepsiCo IncPEP.N is busy touting the value of its current snacks and drinks portfolio, Wall Street thinks the company should consider more drastic moves — such as breaking up, or further shaking up its management.  At the very least, analysts are looking for an increase in investment next year, as the maker of Pepsi-Cola sodas and Frito-Lay snacks tries to make up the gap in North American drink performance between it and market leader Coca-Cola Co(KO.N).  A break-up, such as those being undertaken by Sara Lee Corp SLE.N and Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N, would be one way to increase value for its lagging stock, analysts said.  “Theoretically, could they get some benefit (from staying together)? They could, but they just haven’t,” said Bernstein Research analyst Ali Dibadj. “It’s time to fish or cut bait on this one.”  PepsiCo in July tempered its full-year outlook after its North American drink business performed more poorly than expected in the second quarter. The company will report third-quarter earnings on October 12, and any more bad news there could raise the heat on Pepsi Chief Executive Indra Nooyi, analysts said.  “The company hasn’t really delivered. So I think investors definitely have that view of ‘It’s now or never. Show me something,’” Dibadj said.  PepsiCo shares closed at $60.45 on Tuesday, down 7 percent since Nooyi was named CEO in October 2006. Over the same period, Coke was up 46 percent and the Dow Jones U.S. Food and Beverage Maker’s index .DJUSFB was up nearly 17 percent.  PepsiCo has lost share in the U.S. carbonated soft drinks market for 16 periods out of 22 months since 2010, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.  In the most recent quarter, Pepsi’s drink sales volume rose 5 percent worldwide, but fell 1 percent in North America. Coke’s North American volume was flat, excluding cross-licensed brands like Dr Pepper.  Credit Suisse analyst Carlos Laboy said PepsiCo needs funding to keep pace with Coke and to make faster growth sustainable.  “Cutting guidance again would be insufficient. A spin-off would be optimal,” Laboy wrote in a research note this week.  “A break-up gets us to $85 for PepsiCo. We don’t see a better path for PepsiCo to form the right beverage culture, grow the right people, attract long-term external capital, develop core brands and fund innovation,” Laboy said.  Several analysts have cut estimates or downgraded the stock recently due to concerns about market share losses, high corn costs weighing on its snack business and lower expectations of earnings and sales growth.  Even though PepsiCo has consistently stated its belief in its current portfolio with its “Power of One” slogan, Nooyi has even declared: “I would say if it was a stand-alone company, Frito-Lay North America might well be the best consumer products company.”  PepsiCo has already shaken up management across the company and in the Americas beverage unit, last month naming Frito-Lay executive Albert Carey as the unit’s head. It also said top food and drink executives will now be part of a group whose aim is to forge better working ties between the two sides of its business.  The effort is meant to prove what PepsiCo calls the “Power of One,” or value that can be unlocked by having the snack, beverage and bottling businesses under one roof.  “The combination of our snack and beverage portfolios creates significant value for our shareholders through synergies driven by a common customer base and distribution platform, supplier leverage and shared infrastructure,” a PepsiCo spokesman said in a statement.  “The value of this combined portfolio has been greatest in our international markets ... and we are now well-positioned to realize further benefits in North America,” he added.  Yet the argument that snacks and soda are consumed at the same time and that sales of one can build on the other falls short for some.  “They are two very different sides of the company with very different needs. Sure, soda and snacking go together, but selling those products is different. Meat and potatoes get eaten together and you don’t see those companies combined,” said one investment banker, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.  While a break-up of the company is possible in the longer term, Consumer Edge Research analyst Bill Pecoriello said he thinks the near- to mid-term strategy is more likely stepped-up investment to improve business performance.  It’s not completely clear that a separation of the businesses would improve performance, according to industry consultant Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark LLC.  With ample opportunities to grow sales through combined snack and drink purchases, Pirko said the underperformance of the North American beverage business lies not with the company’s structure but with its management.  “The market has been losing some confidence in Pepsi, and the people who are part of the system — including the bottlers and retailers — have become distressed over what seems to be going on,” Pirko said.  He cited criticism by some in the industry that CEO Nooyi has taken her eye off the core drinks business while focusing on healthier snacks. She has been widely lauded for her deal-making savvy and strategic vision, but some say her tenure as CEO has failed to live up to very high expectations.  “Perhaps she was over-hyped earlier in her start at Pepsi. She was given rock star status,” said Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Investments, which owns about 900,000 PepsiCo shares. “It’s kind of like President Obama being given the Nobel Peace Prize within months of being president ... He hadn’t done anything yet.”  Still, Smith cited PepsiCo’s valuation, dividend yield, earnings quality and defensive characteristics as reasons to continue owning the stock.  A PepsiCo spokesman declined to comment on Nooyi’s tenure as CEO.  A split-up, if it did happen, could make it easier for Pepsi to battle Coca-Cola, better manage its two businesses for their different structural and strategic needs, and allow each to be more nimble in reacting to competitive threats, analysts said.  “Pepsi’s beverage business is far from dead and we believe it can and should have a vibrant future. However, the weight of the Frito-Lay business is severe,” Credit Suisse analysts said.  (Reporting by Jessica Hall in Philadelphia and Martinne Geller in New York, editing by Gerald E.

88,KO,Canada to limit caffeine in energy drinks," * Will limit the amount of caffeine in energy drinks   * Limits high enough that they won’t alter many drinks   * Decides not to restrict sale to pharmacies   OTTAWA, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Canada will restrict the amount of caffeine allowed in energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster Energy but has pulled back from classifying them as stimulative drug products that can only be sold in pharmacies.   Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq announced on Thursday the government’s limits on the amount of caffeine allowed in the drinks and said the government would require labels stating the caffeine levels.   “I believe it’s up to individuals and parents to make their own decisions when it comes to what they eat and drink,” Aglukkaq said in a statement.   An expert panel appointed by Health Canada, the government’s health department, had recommended that energy drinks be labeled as “stimulant-drug containing drinks”. It said they should be listed on a schedule of drugs that can only be sold in pharmacies.   Energy drinks had been classified as “natural health products” but the government has now reclassified them as foods, with full labeling requirements.   Caffeine will be limited to 180 milligrams in a single serving, a level that Health Canada said is comparable to the amount in a medium cup of coffee.   The limit is high enough that it will not make a difference for many energy drinks. A 250 ml (8.4 oz) can of Red Bull Energy Drink, for example, has 80 mg of caffeine. That’s less than a typical cup of coffee but about twice as much as a normal cola.   The panel said that the interaction that caffeine may have with other ingredients in energy drinks - ingredients not found in run-of-the-mill coffee - is not yet well understood.   Seven million energy drinks are sold in Canada every month, according to government estimates.

90,KO,Soft drink makers target U.S. youth online: study,"(Reuters) - U.S. children and teenagers are seeing far more soda advertising than before, with blacks and Hispanics the major targets, as marketers have expanded online, according to a study released on Monday. The report from the Yale University Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity also said many fruit and energy drinks, which are popular with teenagers, have as much added sugar and as many calories as regular soda. “Our children are being assaulted by these drinks that are high in sugar and low in nutrition,” said Yale’s Kelly Brownell, co-author of the report. “The companies are marketing them in highly aggressive ways.” Children’s and teens’ exposure to full-calorie soda ads on television doubled from 2008 to 2010, fueled by increases from Coca-Cola Co and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc, the report found. Children were exposed to 22 percent fewer ads for sugary PepsiCo Inc drinks, it said. Black children and teens saw 80 percent to 90 percent more ads than white children, including twice as many for the 5-Hour Energy drink and Coca-Cola’s vitamin water and Sprite. Hispanic children saw 49 percent more ads for sugary drinks and energy drinks on Spanish-language television, and Hispanic teens saw 99 percent more ads. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about 15 percent of children are overweight or obese. Children today are likely to have shorter life spans than their parents, which would affect their ability to work and pay taxes, while threatening to drive up healthcare costs. When it comes to energy drinks such as Red Bull and Amp, the marketing is skewed toward young people, even though the American Academy of Pediatrics says such highly caffeinated beverages are not appropriate for children and adolescents, the report said. In 2010, teens saw 18 percent more TV ads and heard 46 percent more radio ads for energy drinks than adults did. The American Beverage Association, whose members include soft drink companies, disputed the study’s findings as it also battles proposed taxes on sugary drinks and public health campaigns aimed at reducing consumption. “This report is another attack by known critics in an ongoing attempt to single out one product as the cause of obesity when both common sense and widely accepted science have shown that the reality is far more complicated,” the group’s Chief Executive Officer Susan Neely said in a statement. Neely said member companies are “delivering on their commitment to advertise only water, juice and milk on programing for children under 12.” She cited recent research conducted by Georgetown Economic Services, an economic consulting firm that is a subsidiary of law firm Kelley Drye & Warren, and sponsored by the Grocery Manufacturers Association and the Association of National Advertisers. That research showed that between 2004 and 2010, advertisements for soft drinks decreased by 96 percent, while those for fruit and vegetable juices increased by 199 percent. Brownell, an outspoken critic of the food and beverage industries, said there has been a lot of research on the issue of marketing unhealthy food to children, especially since U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama made fighting childhood obesity her signature issue. Monday’s report, he said, is the first that analyzed data from several firms, including Nielsen Holdings NV, to measure the full picture of youth exposure to marketing and advertising. Brownell said it is important to consider the online interaction children have with brands, especially since they tend to stay on computers longer than they watch TV commercials. The report shows, for example, that 21 sugary drink brands had YouTube channels in 2010, with more than 229 million views by June 2011. Coca-Cola was the most popular brand on Facebook, with more than 30 million fans. The most-visited websites operated by soft drink brands were MyCokeRewards.com and Capri Sun, which is owned by Kraft Foods Inc. Coca-Cola said it has a policy of not marketing to children younger than 12. “This means that we do not buy advertising directly targeted at audiences that are made up of more than 35 percent children under 12,” Coca-Cola said in a statement. “This policy applies to all of our beverage brands and to a wide range of media outlets, including television, radio and print, as well as cinema, the Internet, product placement and mobile phones.” Other findings in the report include an analysis of the drinks themselves. For example, it said an 8-ounce (225-gram) serving of a full-calorie fruit drink has 110 calories and seven teaspoons of sugar — the same amount found in an 8-ounce serving of a soda or energy drink.

The size of the investment is equal to what the world’s largest soft drink company has spent in India over the past 18 years since re-entering the country in 1993. Coca-Cola India and its bottling partners plan to invest in consumer marketing and brand-building, expansion of distribution and cold drink equipment placement and development of manufacturing capacity, it said in a statement. Coca-Cola currently employs about 25,000 people in India, the world’s second-fastest growing major economy, the statement said. Coke pulled out of India in 1977 following a government ruling that would have required it to share its secret formula with Indian partners. The company, which gets the majority of its sales from outside the United States, said last month that foreign exchange rates that boosted its profit in the third quarter would turn against the company in the fourth quarter as the U.S. dollar strengthens.

95,KO,"Jefferies starts Coca-Cola with buy, PepsiCo with hold","(Reuters) - Jefferies initiated coverage on Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) with a “buy” rating, citing the company’s dominant global product portfolio and an exposure in the emerging markets. The brokerage also started coverage on PepsiCo Inc PEP.N with a “hold” rating, saying it sees the company being hurt by slower growth in both its domestic and international businesses, modest growth in volume and rising commodity costs. “We expect (Coca-Cola) to deliver another year of mid-single digit volume growth in 2012 driven by the Latin America, Pacific and Eurasia and Africa segments,” analyst Jeff Farmer said in a note to clients and started Coca-Cola with an $80 price target. Earlier this month, Coca-Cola had said it will invest $2 billion in India over the next five years, to compete with PepsiCo in one of the fastest-growing economies. However, the analyst said PepsiCo’s product portfolio is weighted to slower growing geographies and categories, a disadvantage at a time when investors are increasingly pursuing emerging market exposure. “About 40 percent of (PepsiCo’s) operating income is generated outside of the United States, a big number, but one that puts the company at a disadvantage to its primary global competitor, Coca Cola, at almost 80 percent,” Farmer said. He was also concerned over the possible Frito Lay North America spin-off reported by the New York Post. “Recent precedents such as Kraft KFT.N, Sara Lee SLE.N and Fortune Brands FO.N suggest that large-cap consumer company spin-offs have not resulted in material value creation,” Farmer said. The analyst set a price target of $70 on PepsiCo stock. Shares of Coca-Cola closed at $66.62 and those of PepsiCo closed at $64.09 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.

96,KO,China probe finds Coke yogurt poisoning likely,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese police believe a child who died after drinking a Coca Cola-made yogurt drink was probably the victim of deliberate poisoning, official media said on Tuesday after a testing agency found no toxins in samples from the same batch of the drink. The findings appear to cut the chances of a broader recall of Coke products in northeastern China. “The police’s technical tests and investigations have preliminarily confirmed that this incident is a criminal case in Changchun, which reaffirms that it is not related in any way to our product quality,” Joanna Price, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola said in an emailed statement. An 11-year-old boy died in Changchun city in Jilin province after he drank the strawberry-flavored Pulpy Milky yogurt drink on November 28, and his mother was severely ill after consuming the same drink. Another mother and her daughter became ill after drinking another bottle of the same drink in Jilin a few days earlier, but recovered, Coca-Cola spokeswoman Price said earlier. Police have reached the “preliminary conclusion” that the drink was deliberately adulterated, said the official Xinhua news agency, citing the provincial public security office. Investigators in both cases found highly toxic pesticides present in the remains of the drinks, said the report. But tests carried out by the China National Centre for Food Quality Supervision and Testing “showed no existence of Methomyl or thiodicarb, two toxic pesticides, on the samples of the same batch of the strawberry-flavored milk drinks taken by the victim,” the Xinhua news agency reported late on Monday. Checks of the production process also found they were safe, the report also said, citing a statement from Coca-Cola’s Jilin unit. Checks of other Coca-Cola products on sale in Changchun also did not find toxins, said the Xinhua report from Tuesday. “All these tests and reviews indicate our products are safe and within standards,” Price said in her email. “This incident is an isolated act that occurred in Changchun, and we are one hundred percent confident that our products are safe and in good quality.” The company and officials earlier agreed the yogurt drink should be removed from shelves in Jilin province while the investigation was under way. Food scandals are common in China, where crackdowns have failed to stamp out poisonings and toxin outbreaks that have shaken consumer confidence. Foreign companies are watched closely as they are generally perceived to hold stricter standards. When western companies are accused of transgressions, it becomes big news in China. The Xinhua report said cases in 2009 and 2010 of a man and a teenager being poisoned by mercury in Sprite, a Coke-produced softdrink, were traced to intentional poisonings, not quality problems. The mother of the dead boy has stabilized and is recovering, and the two victims of the other poisoning have already checked out of hospital, the Xinhua report said.

Coke and Aujan on Wednesday said the deal would be the largest-ever investment by a multinational company in the Middle East’s consumer goods sector. The transaction is slated to close in the first half of 2012. While Coke dominates the global beverage business, Pepsi is the leader in the Middle East, Beverage Digest editor and publisher John Sicher told Reuters. “This deal begins to give Coke more critical mass in these countries where Pepsi dominates and should, over time, enhance Coke’s presence in those markets,” Sicher said. Under the agreement, Coca-Cola will acquire a 50 percent stake in the entity that holds the rights to Aujan’s brands and a 49 percent stake in Aujan’s bottling and distribution company. Aujan brands include Rani, a line of juices, and Barbican, a flavored malt beverage. “The Middle East is a high-growth region” with some of the highest rates of nonalcoholic drink consumption per capita, Ahmet Bozer, Coca-Cola’s president for Eurasia and Africa, said in a statement. The Middle East currently contributes a small fraction of Coke’s overall sales. The company in October announced plans to invest $5 billion in the Middle East and North Africa over the next 10 years. Aujan Chairman Adel Aujan told Arabiya television in an interview that he hoped to double revenue in five years, from the current 3 billion riyals ($800 million) annually. “Sixty-five percent of our sales are outside the kingdom (of Saudi Arabia) and we compete with international companies, so as time goes by I see that these giant international companies — we don’t have their capabilities,” Aujan said. The agreement excludes Aujan’s Iranian manufacturing and distribution business, the companies said. Coke gets a significant portion of its sales from outside the United States and has been buoyed by its presence in emerging markets, where workers with rising incomes are supporting more beverage sales. Shares of Coca-Cola were down 16 cents at $66.42 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

102,KO,Super Bowl advertisers seek buzz on social media,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the age of Twitter and Facebook, many Super Bowl viewers will use the commercial breaks to go online and see what people are saying about the game. This year, advertisers want them to tweet about their favorite commercials as well. Having spent record-breaking sums to secure the most valuable television slots in advertising, global brands from Coca-Cola to Volkwagen are looking to leverage social media to extend the buzz and reach of their ads. According to executives from Comcast Corp’s NBC television network, which will broadcast the February 5 football game, a 30-second commercial slot cost $3.5 million on average this year, up from $3 million for last year’s Super Bowl, which was on News Corp’s Fox station. “The social media conversation has put more value on a Super Bowl ad, fans will discuss your ads on Twitter and Facebook and then go to YouTube to watch it on demand over and over again,” said Brad Adgate, senior vice president of research at Horizon Media. This year’s Super Bowl will take place in Indianapolis, with the New York Giants and New England Patriots battling it out for the National Football League Championship. An expected 100 million people will watch the game, which is among a dwindling number of TV programs that still draw big live audiences. NFL games are so valuable to advertisers that the league recently secured hefty pay increases that will bring in about $6 billion a year from Walt Disney Co’s ESPN, broadcast networks and satellite TV provider DirecTV for rights to air games and sell the advertising time. The average price of Super Bowl ads have risen more than 50 percent in the last 10 years, defying economic downturns and secular industry issues. NBC sold out all 70 spots around this year’s game shortly after Thanksgiving weekend in November and reached a new high with one slot selling for around $4 million. The game, including lower priced halftime slots, could easily generate over a quarter of a billion dollars in ad sales. “The overall demand for Super Bowl spots is very high this year,” said Tim Calkins, marketing professor at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. “Prices are high. Demand is high. I think that’s a very positive sign for the economy.” Consumer research forecasts that 60 percent of fans watching the Super Bowl will also be tied into a second screen such as a smartphone or tablet. COKE Vs PEPSI ON SOCIAL MEDIA Anheuser-Busch, which typically buys exclusivity as the only beer advertiser during recent Super Bowls, is again the biggest spender, according to industry sources. Not unlike past Super Bowls, Coca Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc will face-off for soda supremacy. Both beverage makers have come up with campaigns that attempt to leverage social media after their commercials air. Coca-Cola’s TV commercials, which will air during the first-and second-quarter breaks, will center around its computer-generated Arctic polar bears watching the game. The bears will then be brought to life on Twitter, Facebook and on a dedicated Website doing such things as responding to fans and commenting on the game. They will even have their own Twitter hashtag —#GameDayPolarBears — for fans to follow. “We wanted to interact with consumers in the most simple and organic way so they would have nothing to do other than what they usually do,” said Pio Schunker, Coca Cola senior vice president of integrated marketing platforms. Fans who catch Pepsi’s commercial with “X Factor USA” winner Melanie Amaro performing the Otis Redding song “Respect” will be able to download a free video of the performance by using the Shazam app on their phones to capture audio from the commercial. There are also partnerships with online radio service Pandora Media Inc and social TV specialist GetGlue centered around the game and other free content. “Our philosophy now is nothing happens in isolation,” said Shiv Singh, global head of digital for Pepsico Beverages. “Social TV is a massive phenomenon and a critical element of our Super Bowl campaigns.” The biggest spender by category is the autos industry, which made a big comeback last year and was noted for one of the most memorable spots — Volkswagen AG’s ad with a young child dressed in a Darth Vader outfit believing he can control the Passat car’s lights. This year, Volkswagen’s Audi is hoping to win more creative kudos with a spot that taps into the “Twilight” teen vampire pop culture phenomenon. The 60-second spot, which will air during the first break in the game, will highlight the new 2013 Audi S7 and its LED headlight technology, which has unfortunate consequences for a party of young vampires. Audi hopes to continue the conversation about the ad via the Twitter hashtag #SoLongVampires. NBC executives say the auto makers are leading a trend toward long-form campaigns of 60 seconds or more, allowing high-end creative concepts to be fleshed out in the commercial’s narrative rather than just going for a quick gag and punchline. Chrysler Group LLC, Toyota Motor Co, Honda Motor Co Ltd, Hyundai Motor Co, and other automakers will also be advertising during the game. General Motors Co’s mainstream Chevy brand will run seven TV commercials before, during and after the game, for instance. It will also center its overall campaign heavily around Web-based partnerships with NBC, Twitter and Facebook. With the conventional wisdom being that consumers are more likely to make a purchase if recommended by a friend or family member, chief marketing officers are keen to insert themselves in a Facebook or Twitter conversation about the products and services they sell. Bluefin Labs, a start-up company that aggregates and analyzes TV viewer data and comments on Twitter and Facebook, has been hired by several advertising agencies with Super Bowl campaigns to help understand how football fans react to the commercials during the game. “Advertisers don’t think about the TV campaign alone anymore but as a way to reach eyeballs and then stimulate conversations about their brands,” said Bluefin executive Tom Thai. While advertisers are eager to experiment with social media during a big-ticket event like the Super Bowl, there are still questions on how they measure its impact with a consistent, industry-accepted method, said Alex Iskold, founder of GetGlue, which lets TV fans share their viewing experiences by ‘checking-in’ in exchange for online rewards. “Social TV engagement hasn’t been fully priced yet,” Iskold said. “We are collectively working to figure out the value to the advertisers. “It took years for the traditional display ad model to solidify; I don’t think it will take us that long to price social TV.” ",1292012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-superbowl-advertising/super-bowl-advertisers-seek-buzz-on-social-media-idUSTRE80S0JX20120129

106,KO,"UPDATE 5-Coca-Cola beats Street, eyes cost savings","* Q4 adj EPS 79 cents vs Wall Street estimate of 77 cents * Aims for savings of $550 mln-$650 mln by end of 2015 * Savings to go toward brand-building, inflation cushioning * Shares up 0.9 pct By Martinne Geller NEW YORK, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co  reported better-than-expected quarterly results and announced a new cost-savings program that it will use to boost its brands and mitigate higher commodity costs. Coke’s results on Tuesday were “solid” given the weak global economy, said Consumer Edge Research analyst Bill Pecoriello. In particular, a 1 percent increase in North American sales volume was better than the 1 percent drop he expected. “Key issues heading into 2012 include managing against continued tough global macroeconomic conditions, commodity inflation, foreign exchange headwinds and stepped-up competitive spending,” Pecoriello said. Rival PepsiCo Inc’s CEO Indra Nooyi is expected to announce a large investment in that company’s North American brands when it reports earnings on Thursday, as a way to narrow the gap in sales performance with Coke. Her plan comes after an in-depth business review, and is likely to include more advertising but could also include discounts at retail, say analysts and other market observers. “Great advertising and marketing can probably move the needle in a two- to three-year time frame,” said Beverage Digest publisher John Sicher. “The only thing that moves the needle quickly is pricing, and in a commodity environment we’re in now, using pricing to move the needle is very tricky.” Like most food and beverage companies, Coke and Pepsi have been facing higher costs for raw materials like corn sweetener and packaging. That has turned up the need for price increases, which can hurt consumer demand, especially in a weak economy. Coke said on Thursday that it expects higher costs for juices and sweeteners to contribute to a $350 million to $450 million increase in costs in 2012. That is down from an $800 million increase in 2011. Coke’s fourth-quarter net income was $1.65 billion, or 72 cents per share, down from $5.77 billion, or $2.46 per share, a year earlier, when the company recorded a gain related to the acquisition of its North American bottling operations. Excluding items, earnings were 79 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 77 cents, as compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 5 percent to $11.04 billion as Coke gained market share in several drink categories. Sales volume rose 3 percent, growing 4 percent in Latin America and Eurasia and Africa, 5 percent in the Pacific and 1 percent in Europe and North America, where weak economies and growing health consciousness has curbed demand. Coke announced a new productivity program targeting annual savings of $350 million to $400 million by the end of 2015. The company also raised its target for savings from the integration of its North American bottling operations by $200 million to $250 million. Together, these initiatives should lead to savings of $550 million to $650 million a year by the end of 2015. Coke said it will reinvest those savings into “brand building initiatives” and to help mitigate potential near-term commodity inflation. “If Pepsi starts discounting to gain share, Coke will have to be able to respond to that,” said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo. “I think that’s the reason they’re trying to get a lot of costs out of their system so they can reinvest if they have to,” he said, referring to Coke. In an interview with Reuters, Coke CEO Muhtar Kent declined to comment on the company’s competition with Pepsi. On a conference call with analysts, Kent said he expects North American soda prices to increase, after gaining 4 percent in the fourth quarter. “I think it will be right to assume that this kind of rational pricing would continue in terms of rates for 2012,” Kent said. “There is no room in business for irrationality over the long term.” Coca-Cola shares were up 63 cents at $68.66 on the New York Stock Exchange.",2072012,http://www.reuters.com/article/cocacola/update-5-coca-cola-beats-street-eyes-cost-savings-idUSL2E8D71RF20120207

113,KO,Greek Coke bottler sees hope after austerity hit 2011,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Hellenic (CCH) HLBr.AT, Coca-Cola’s (KO.N) No. 2 bottler in the world, saw an improving trend in the fourth quarter as profit rose for the first time in 2011, beating forecasts. The Athens-based company, Greece’s biggest by market value, has suffered from weak demand in many of its markets, but particularly Greece and Italy, since the global credit crisis in 2008. Core profit in the fourth quarter rose 14 percent to 73 million euros on revenues up 2 percent to 1.53 billion euros ($2.01 billion) thanks to cost cutting and other actions. Sales volume in the fourth quarter still declined three percent to 465.4 million unit cases, with Greece being among the worst hit with a 28 percent drop. “In the first quarter (of 2012)...trends are still negative but they do not appear as deep as in the fourth quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Dimitris Lois told Reuters in a telephone interview. For 2011 as a whole the company reported a drop in net profit of 27 percent to 330 million euros ($433 million), in line with forecasts and before restructuring costs of 60 million euros. At 1159 GMT, the shares were marginally higher at 14.75 euros, outperforming Athens bourse's general index .ATG which was down 2.2 percent. “Fourth-quarter reported sales growth was ahead of volume growth...as the benefit of some of CCH’s pricing initiatives taken earlier in the year started to kick in,” Eurobank EFG Equities analyst Stamatis Draziotis said. “As a result, the group recorded its first quarterly growth in comparable EBIT since last year, a positive sign that EBIT margins may be reaching their trough.” The firm, which has operations in 27 countries in Europe and also in Nigeria, said it was continuing with its cost cutting and offering more affordable products. “What are we doing is translating the needs of our consumers and these needs are addressed with the right package for our consumers at the right price,” Lois said. Wage cuts and tax hikes have hit demand in Greece since 2010, when the country signed its first EU/IMF bailout, and in struggling Italy last year, two of CCH’s biggest markets, along with a double-digit percentage rise in raw material costs. Some 12,000 points of sale closed in Greece last year and conditions in the cash-strapped nation will remain tough in 2012, Lois said. CCH said it would invest 1.45 billion euros in 2012-14 to boost its brands, including ahead of this year’s European Soccer Championships and Olympic Games, higher than the 1.35 billion euros it targeted for the 2011-2013 period. Lois said the money will be spent in countries that provide better growth potential and Russia was one of them.

114,KO,UPDATE 2-Greek Coke bottler sees hope after austerity hit 2011,"* 2011 comparable net profit 330 mln euros * Austerity in Greece, Italy, raw materials hurt results * Q4 comparable core profit grew after 3 declining quarters * CEO says bottler to stick to savings, revenue growth   (Adds CEO, analyst quotes, share price, detail) By Angeliki Koutantou ATHENS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Hellenic (CCH) , Coca-Cola’s No. 2 bottler in the world, saw an improving trend in the fourth quarter as profit rose for the first time in 2011, beating forecasts. The Athens-based company, Greece’s biggest by market value, has suffered from weak demand in many of its markets, but particularly Greece and Italy, since the global credit crisis in 2008. Core profit in the fourth quarter rose 14 percent to 73 million euros on revenues up 2 percent to 1.53 billion euros ($2.01 billion) thanks to cost cutting and other actions. Sales volume in the fourth quarter still declined three percent to 465.4 million unit cases, with Greece being among the worst hit with a 28 percent drop. “In the first quarter (of 2012)...trends are still negative but they do not appear as deep as in the fourth quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Dimitris Lois told Reuters in a telephone interview. For 2011 as a whole the company reported a drop in net profit of 27 percent to 330 million euros ($433 million), in line with forecasts and before restructuring costs of 60 million euros. At 1159 GMT, the shares were marginally higher at 14.75 euros, outperforming Athens bourse’s general index which was down 2.2 percent. “Fourth-quarter reported sales growth was ahead of volume growth...as the benefit of some of CCH’s pricing initiatives taken earlier in the year started to kick in,” Eurobank EFG Equities analyst Stamatis Draziotis said. “As a result, the group recorded its first quarterly growth in comparable EBIT since last year, a positive sign that EBIT margins may be reaching their trough.” The firm, which has operations in 27 countries in Europe and also in Nigeria, said it was continuing with its cost cutting and offering more affordable products. “What are we doing is translating the needs of our consumers and these needs are addressed with the right package for our consumers at the right price,” Lois said. Wage cuts and tax hikes have hit demand in Greece since 2010, when the country signed its first EU/IMF bailout, and in struggling Italy last year, two of CCH’s biggest markets, along with a double-digit percentage rise in raw material costs. Some 12,000 points of sale closed in Greece last year and conditions in the cash-strapped nation will remain tough in 2012, Lois said. CCH said it would invest 1.45 billion euros in 2012-14 to boost its brands, including ahead of this year’s European Soccer Championships and Olympic Games, higher than the 1.35 billion euros it targeted for the 2011-2013 period. Lois said the money will be spent in countries that provide better growth potential and Russia was one of them. The CEO declined to speculate on a possible Greek default and said the company was expecting the government to take steps to bring back growth in the country.

KOF has experience working in Mexico, a massive market for bottled drinks, and also in Central and South America. This would be its first foray outside of the region. Coke FEMSA went on a buying spree in Mexico last year and analysts on average expect the company to post a 16.6 percent jump in fourth-quarter earnings when it reports next week.

117,KO,"UPDATE 1-Coke, Dr Pepper react to Pepsi ad increase","By Martinne Geller Feb 22 (Reuters) - Top executives from PepsiCo Inc’s  two biggest competitors were unfazed Wednesday by a significant increase of North American advertising by the number two soft-drink maker. Coca-Cola Co Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said he did not expect his company to increase its advertising budget as a percentage of revenue, even though Pepsi announced an increase in advertising of $500 million to $600 million this year. “As of today, I don’t see that we’ll be adding to what we’ve already planned. We’ve got a great plan in place in the U.S. and I feel confident in our plan,” Fayard said on Wednesday at the annual Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Boca Raton, Florida. “I think we’re OK.” Coca-Cola and its bottlers spent about $17 billion in direct marketing, including advertising, in 2010 and 2011, Fayard said. “Coca-Cola’s brands have already benefited from healthy, consistent investment in recent years,” said Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog. Also on Wednesday, at the same conference, Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc Chief Executive Larry Young said he was “very excited” about PepsiCo’s plan to boost advertising on 12 brands including Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, Tropicana, Quaker and Doritos. That is because PepsiCo distributes Dr Pepper sodas in some markets, as does Coca-Cola. “Whenever they spend, our brands go up with them,” Young said. “The tide rises and all the boats go up with it.” PepsiCo earlier this month laid out a plan to improve its North American beverage business that included stepped-up advertising and thousands of job cuts.",2222012,http://www.reuters.com/article/cocacola/update-1-coke-dr-pepper-react-to-pepsi-ad-increase-idUSL2E8DMD7P20120222

119,KO,TEXT-Fitch affirms Coca-Cola Inc ratings,"Feb 24 - Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and the debt ratings of The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its subsidiaries as follows:	 	 The Coca-Cola Company	 —Long-term IDR at ‘A+’;	 —Bank credit facilities at ‘A+’;	 —Senior unsecured debt at ‘A+’;	 —Short-term IDR at ‘F1’;	 —Commercial paper (CP) at ‘F1’. 	 	 Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (CCR)	 —Long-term IDR at ‘A+’;	 —Senior unsecured debt at ‘A+’;	 —Senior shelf at ‘A+’.	 	 The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch’s actions affect approximately $28.6 billion	 of debt as of Dec. 31, 2011. 	 	 Coca-Cola’s ratings reflect the company’s ability to consistently generate 	 considerable cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash flow (FCF). 	 Coca-Cola generated $9.5 billion and $2.3 billion of CFO and FCF, respectively, 	 for the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, after generating over $9.5 billion and $3.2 	 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2010. The recent FCF was weighed down by a 	 $769 million contribution to the company’s pension plans in the first quarter of	 2011 and cash outlays for restructuring. Fitch expects Coca-Cola’s FCF to exceed	 $2 billion in 2012, due to its substantial CFFO, despite an additional $900 	 million contribution to its pension funds in the current year. 	 	 The ratings are further supported by Coca-Cola’s unique and large cash position.	 Coca-Cola’s leverage has increased to 2.2 times (x) on a total debt to operating	 EBITDA basis, which is outside of the A+ rating category for a company like 	 Coca-Cola. However, Coca-Cola’s growing $14 billion balance of cash and 	 short-term investments, primarily held outside the U.S., to some extent 	 mitigates this. Fitch expects Coca-Cola to maintain this cash balance to provide	 backup to its CP borrowings, which have increased because of its reluctance to 	 repatriate cash and its desire to return cash to shareholders. Coca-Cola has a 	 mismatch between its U.S. cash outflows and its significant international cash 	 inflows. The late 2010 acquisition of CCR, its U.S. and Canadian bottling 	 operations, will offset some of the cash flow mismatch, but it is expected to 	 persist. A material reduction in Coca-Cola’s cash balance without a commensurate	 reduction in debt would be credit negative.	 	 Fitch expects Coca-Cola’s operating income to grow in the low to mid-single 	 digits in 2012, enabling stable credit metrics and growing cash flow generation.	 This forecast is based on the assumption that revenue grows in the low single 	 digits range due to volume and price/mix increases partially offsetting adverse 	 foreign currency effects. Operational efficiencies due to cost saving programs 	 and ongoing restructuring activities related to the acquisition of CCR should 	 also benefit operating income in 2012.	 	 Coca-Cola has committed to another $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion of net share 	 repurchases in 2012 after repurchasing $2.9 billion in 2011. While these 	 commitments are large, they are below Fitch’s estimate of normalized FCF of $3.0	 billion to $4.0 billion. Ratings also consider the potential of future 	 acquisitions given the company’s transaction history. For large transactions, 	 Fitch expects the company to curtail share repurchases. Fitch recognizes 	 Coca-Cola’s acquisitions and share repurchases may be partially funded with 	 debt, but expects the company to maintain credit statistics in line with current	 levels due to cash flow growth. 	 	 Coca-Cola’s ratings could be positively affected by the company attaining total 	 debt to operating EBITDA below 1.5x in combination with a stated commitment to 	 maintain stronger credit protection measures. Conversely, Coca-Cola’s ratings 	 would be negatively affected by a large debt-financed acquisition or share 	 repurchase program or a reduction in cash and cash equivalents without a 	 commensurate reduction in debt. Fitch notes that while Coca-Cola has more CP 	 outstanding than capacity under its various committed facilities, the company 	 has consistently maintained a large cash balance, and the combination of cash 	 and facility availability provide adequate backup for the CP. Coca-Cola had 	 $12.9 billion of CP and other short-term borrowings at Dec. 31, 2011.	 	 For the year ended Dec. 31, 2011, Coca-Cola’s total debt to operating EBITDA was	 2.2x, up from 2.1x a year earlier due higher debt balances. The company’s gross 	 interest to operating EBITDA was 30.5x at the most recent year end, increasing 	 from 15.9x the previous year due to cycling of one time charges classified as 	 interest in 2010. Coca-Cola’s FFO Interest Coverage reflected a similar 	 increase, rising to 25.6x from 13.8x over the same time period.	 	 At Dec. 31, 2011, Coca-Cola’s liquidity position of $18.6 billion consisted of 	 $12.8 billion of cash, as mentioned previously, $1.2 billion of short-term 	 investments, and $4.6 billion of availability under its committed credit lines 	 and revolving credit facility. Coca-Cola has a manageable maturity schedule and 	 robust access to the capital markets. Fitch expects the firm to refinance the 	 approximate $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion of long-term debt due in 2012 and 	 2013. 	 	 The Coca-Cola Company’s (Coca-Cola) ratings are supported by its position as the	 largest global beverage company. Coca-Cola has fifteen $1 billion brands, 	 including Coca-Cola, one of the world’s most valuable. Given the prominence of 	 carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola’s beverage portfolio, the ratings 	 consider the multiyear decline in CSD volumes in the U.S. and modest CSD growth 	 in other developed countries. This exposure is mitigated by Coca-Cola’s market 	 strength in developing, high-growth geographies.	 	 Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola	 Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations since default risk is very low 	 at this level on the rating scale. CCR’s notes are structurally superior to the 	 notes issued by Coca-Cola.",2242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWNA098220120224

125,KO,Coca-Cola keeps Italian orange suppliers after protests,"ROME, March 6 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola gave in to pressure from Italian orange producers and said on Tuesday it would continue buying from local suppliers to produce its Fanta soda in spite of a report denouncing the tough work conditions of immigrant fruit pickers. The move by the U.S. soft-drink giant came after a report in British magazine The Ecologist last month shone a light on the situation of immigrant workers in the southern Calabria town of Rosarno, the scene of racial clashes two years ago. “It wasn’t our initial intention, but considering the emotional situation we’re in ... we have decided to keep our local supplier,” said Salvatore Gabola, director of European public affairs at Coca-Cola Co, told reporters in Rome. The soda maker, which says it uses only Italian oranges for the local version of its fizzy Fanta beverage, had infuriated local farmers and trade unions by announcing after The Ecologist’s report that it would stop buying concentrated orange juice produced near Rosarno. The Coca-Cola executive denied the company’s initial decision to stop a number of contracts with local suppliers had anything to do with the British report, but said Coca-Cola remained “preoccupied by the life conditions of immigrants.” After a meeting in Rome with Agriculture Minister Mario Catania, Gabola said multi-year contracts with Calabrian and Sicilian producers would be signed in the coming years to “increase the quality and competitiveness” of the industry. Asked by reporters whether the soft-drink maker had demanded anything in return, the agriculture minister said the government had not offered any “direct or indirect” compensation to Coca-Cola to sweeten the deal. Some 8,000 illegal immigrants work in the southern Calabria region, which was the scene of the worst episode of racial unrest in Italy in years in early 2010. Most come from Africa and work as day labourers picking fruit and vegetables. Many of them live in abandoned factories with no running water or electricity and human rights groups say they are exploited by organised crime. Competition from other global producers of oranges such as Mexico, Brazil or the United States is also pressuring local farmers, keeping local wages as low as 25 euros ($33) a day, Alberto Callello, a local farmer, told The Ecologist. “I get 7 cents per kilo for industrial oranges (used for concentrates) but need 8 cents per kilo to pay workers, so there is a paradox,” he said, according to the magazine. “At the end of the chain is a clash with poor people.” Coca-Cola’s Gabola declined to give an estimate of the price the new work contracts will offer suppliers, but said the group’s decision should not lead to “higher prices but more productivity.” Some 12 percent of Coca-Cola’s Fanta soda is made of concentrated orange juice, the company says on its website, a higher percentage than in the rest of Europe. Italy was the world’s 8th largest producer of oranges in 2010, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, with 2.4 million tonnes. Calabria produces about a quarter of the output, with half of its oranges used for juices and soft drinks, according to the agriculture minister.",3062012,http://www.reuters.com/article/coca-cola-italy/coca-cola-keeps-italian-orange-suppliers-after-protests-idUSL5E8E66NJ20120306
126,KO,US regulators dispute finding of cancer-causing soda,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators said soft drinks from PepsiCo Inc and Coca-Cola Co posed no health risk, contrary to a U.S. watchdog group that reported several popular brands contain high levels of a chemical linked to cancer in animals. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) said it found unsafe levels of a chemical used to make caramel color in cans of Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc’s Dr. Pepper, and Whole Foods’ 365 Cola. The group asked the Food and Drug Administration to ban caramel coloring agents that contain the chemical known as 4-methylimidazole, or 4-MI. This follows a similar plea last year. “Coke and Pepsi, with the acquiescence of the FDA, are needlessly exposing millions of Americans to a chemical that causes cancer,” said CSPI executive director Michael Jacobson. The FDA said it was reviewing the group’s petition, but the drinks were still safe. “A consumer would have to consume well over a thousand cans of soda a day to reach the doses administered in the studies that have shown links to cancer in rodents,” said Doug Karas, an FDA spokesman, in a statement. The cans were all taken from stores in the Washington, D.C. area, and some had levels of 4-MI near 140 micrograms in each 12-ounce can, the watchdog group said. The state of California has a legal limit of 29 micrograms of 4-MI, it added. The FDA’s limit for 4-MI in caramel coloring is 250 parts per million (ppm). That caramel would then be diluted when it is put in soda. The highest levels of 4-MI, also known as 4-MEI, found by CSPI were about 0.4 ppm, according to Reuters calculations. “Unlike CSPI, the Coca-Cola Company deals in hard facts,” said Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Sheidler in an emailed statement. “Fact: The body of science about 4-MEI in foods or beverages does not support the erroneous allegations that CSPI would like the public to believe. The 4-MEI levels in our products pose no health or safety risks.” Sheilder added: “The caramel color in all of our ingredients has been, is and always will be safe.

Banking stocks - Tuesday’s big losers - were the strongest sector on Wednesday. The KBW bank index .BKX advanced 1.9 percent. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) gained 3.2 percent to $17.88 following a 5.3 percent drop in the previous session. “Earlier in the week, portfolio managers, advisors and institutional money managers were looking for some sort of pullback just because it’s good to buy on the dip, and we’ve had such a nice run,” said Mark Martiak,, senior wealth strategist at Premier Financial Advisors in New York. “The right part of the economic good news, good data story was the private sector adding 216,000 jobs.” The news comes after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke stirred caution among many in financial markets last week by giving no clear indication that he plans to spur faster growth by pushing for another round of asset purchases, or quantitative easing. Improving economic figures have helped push the S&P; 500 up more than 20 percent from the October closing low. Investors continued to eye signs of progress in negotiations between fiscally troubled Greece and private creditors that will result in a substantial write-down for Greece’s debt costs. Tuesday’s tumble was prompted by renewed concerns about Greece and the outlook for the global economy. It was one of the worst performances since stocks began rallying in October and the third straight decline for the S&P; 500. Six Greek pension funds are still holding out against joining the deal while eight have agreed to take part. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 78.18 points, or 0.61 percent, to 12,837.33 at the close. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX climbed 9.27 points, or 0.69 percent, to 1,352.63. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC added 25.37 points, or 0.87 percent, to 2,935.69. The PHLX housing sector index .HGX advanced 2.7 percent, with Hovnanian Enterprises (HOV.N) up 2.5 percent at $2.46 after posting results. Apple shares were volatile as the company unveiled its latest iPad, which commands upwards of two-thirds of the growing tablet market. Apple shares fluctuated between gains and losses after the reveal, closing up just 0.08 percent at $530.69. Earlier in the session, Apple’s stock had gained as much as 1.4 percent to reach an intraday high at $537.78. Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc (FCX.N) fell 1.1 percent to $38.99 and Newmont Mining Corp (NEM.N) slipped 0.9 percent to $56.68 after Indonesia announced new rules to take more profits from vast mineral resources by limiting foreign ownership of mines. The PHLX gold/silver index .XAU shed 0.1 percent. Investors kept an eye on oil prices after France voiced skepticism that a planned revival of talks between six world powers and Iran over its nuclear program would succeed. Rising geopolitical tensions could bring war to the region, raise oil prices, and harm the global economy. Volume was light, with about 6 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, below the daily average of 6.9 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a ratio of nearly 4 to 1, while on the Nasdaq, about three stocks rose for every one that fell.

129,KO,SEC charges ex-Coca-Cola Enterprises VP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Securities regulators charged a former Coca-Cola Enterprises CCE.N executive on Thursday with insider-trading, saying his illegal trades helped him reap $86,850 in illicit profits. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s case, filed in a federal district court in California, alleges that former Coca-Cola Enterprises Vice President Steven Harrold, 53, bought company stock in his wife’s brokerage account after learning his company planned to acquire The Coca-Cola Co’s (KO.N) bottling operations in Norway and Sweden. An attorney for Harrold could not be immediately reached for comment. The main business of Coca-Cola Co, the world’s biggest soft drinks maker, is to sell beverage concentrate, or syrup.

131,KO,Wall Street erases week's losses on Greek hopes,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Thursday, recovering most of the week’s losses, after Greece moved closer to a bond swap with private creditors to avoid a messy default. Earlier in the week, the S&P; 500 posted its first big loss for the year on fears of a disorderly default in Greece. Now it is down just 0.3 percent for the week, and Thursday’s advance was led by shares in the materials and industrial sectors. Greece was able to convince enough private bondholders to accept a restructuring on Thursday, moving it closer to unlocking aid needed to avoid a disruptive default. “Today’s move is based on the assumption that the Greek deal is resolved. But this is an important week, as we still have the jobs report due tomorrow,” said Jack DeGan, chief investment officer at Harbor Advisory Corp in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Expectation for Friday’s U.S. jobs data are for a net gain of 210,000 jobs in February. An unexpected rise in new U.S. weekly jobless claims on Thursday was not enough to change perceptions that the labor market was strengthening - a major catalyst in the current rally. “As long as it comes in line with forecast, or even a little bit lower, it will strengthen the current upward trend,” DeGan said. Apple shares (AAPL.O) jumped 2.1 percent to $541.99. Analysts said Apple will continue to retain the lion’s share of the tablet market as its new 4G-enabled iPad readies for competition from Windows 8-based products, and a cheaper iPad 2 takes on Amazon’s popular Kindle Fire. An S&P; index of basic materials stocks .GSPM shot up 1.6 percent, leading the S&P; 500’s advance. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB commodities index .CRB rose 0.6 percent, shifting into positive mode after four straight down sessions. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 70.61 points, or 0.55 percent, to 12,907.94 at the close. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX rose 13.28 points, or 0.98 percent, to 1,365.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC advanced 34.73 points, or 1.18 percent, to close at 2,970.42. Coach Inc COH.N, the luxury leather goods retailer, hit a record high of $78.22 after the overall positive tone of a presentation at a Bank of America conference. The stock later eased, but it still ended up 4.6 percent at $76.79. American International Group Inc (AIG.N) fell 3.9 percent to $28.31 after the U.S. Treasury priced its $6 billion offering of AIG stock at $29 a share. That would allow the Obama administration to break even on its investment in the insurer as it winds down bailout programs from the financial crisis. The S&P; financial sector .GSPF gained 1 percent while the KBW insurance index .KIX climbed 0.7 percent. The Dow was pressured by McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N). The stock fell 3.2 percent to $96.96 after the world’s largest hamburger chain reported a smaller-than-expected rise in February sales. Hovnanian Enterprises (HOV.N) shares jumped 13.4 percent to $2.79, pushing the PHLX housing sector index .HGX up 3 percent. Volume was light, with about 6.1 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Amex and Nasdaq, below the daily average of 6.9 billion. Advancers outnumbered decliners by a ratio of 4 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, about 18 stocks rose for nearly every seven that fell.

132,KO,"Insight: Coke, Conoco, Icahn among big fish on MF Global hook","CHICAGO (Reuters) - Oil major ConocoPhillips, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, Coca Cola and giant energy trader Mercuria are among a crop of previously unnamed, high-profile former clients of bankrupt futures brokerage MF Global, an examination of claims filed in the case shows. Fifty of MF Global’s bigger former customers — including large hedge funds, multinational powerhouses, and other major traders — had about $1.2 billion lodged with MF Global when it collapsed, according to a Reuters analysis of about 10,000 of the nearly 28,000 claims in the case. Together these top 50 accounted for more than a fifth of the broker’s total customer funds. The claims shed new light on what was once one of the world’s most active commodity brokerages, showing it attracted big-ticket clients along with the farmers, ranchers and retail investors who have raised the loudest cry over its collapse. Five directors of exchange operator CME Group have also filed claims, an indication of how the company’s bankruptcy caught even well-informed investors by surprise. “We had nothing against MF Global. We thought they were a good firm,” said Icahn, who has a claim but is not among the former clients baying for blood. Like most traders with commodity accounts at MF Global, Icahn has gotten about 72 percent of his money back. Even if he never sees the rest of those funds, Icahn said he will have made $15 million or so during the year the account was open. His account at MF Global backed a single options trader, a bit player in the scheme of Icahn’s $9 billion fund. It held $85 million on the broker’s final day of business, October 31. Marathon Petroleum Corp, Nestle SA, General Mills Inc, Anheuser-Busch Inbev, energy giant Tesoro Corp and Spam-maker Hormel Foods Corp are among the companies still waiting on the return of at least $333 million, based on the analysis, which may not capture all of MF Global’s biggest former customers. A spokesman for the trustee declined to identify the top MF Global claims, citing privacy concerns. Investors were attracted to MF Global, run by former Goldman Sachs CEO Jon Corzine, for its relatively low trading fees, name recognition and specialization in commodities trading. Nestle used its accounts in futures transactions for a mix of commodities, said Prashant Kulkarni, a risk management lead for the company. The chocolate maker has received back about 72 percent of the nearly $9.2 million in its accounts, he said. Options trader Billy Hunt moved his money to MF Global after Goldman Sachs, his broker of many years, told him it would no longer back individual traders like him. He selected MF Global because he was a former client of its predecessor, Refco. Hunt kept a large balance - $26 million when MF Global went under - in his accounts to back his specialized, high-margin trades. He shifted money to MF Global just two months before it collapsed and has yet to recover about $7.9 million. Other big traders were linked to MF Global because they worked with other brokerages that cleared trades through the firm. Daniel Bowman, a cattle trader in Chicago, saw his accounts transferred to MF Global when it bought his longtime brokerage Dowd Wescott. He had his life savings at MF Global, including a $5 million Treasury bill and $2.5 million in cash, he said. He is still waiting for $1.5 million back. “I’m at retirement age and he’s got all my money,” said Bowman, 74, referring to Corzine. It was hard for even big traders to escape MF Global in the days before it imploded. Many became nervous after the broker disclosed it had made risky bets on European sovereign debt. Magic Capital, a $25 million hedge fund that did its futures trading and kept virtually all its capital at MF Global, decided three days before the bankruptcy to pull its money out, said Jennifer Yu, a back-office manager at the Rockville, Maryland-based firm. But the transfer request did not go through in time. Now Magic is 28 percent smaller, due to the amount the bankruptcy trustee has held back. Segregated accounts were supposed to keep customer funds safe, even if the broker failed. MF Global’s European exposure also spooked Highridge Futures Fund, a hedge fund that had $50 million in accounts. Highridge general partner Michael Recine said he also tried to empty the accounts three days before MF Global collapsed but “for some reason my bank couldn’t handle the whole transfer.” DRW Holdings, one of Chicago’s biggest trading firms, is one firm that closed its accounts early enough. It had about $5 million at MF Global when the broker disclosed on October 25 that it had put a $6.3 billion bet on European sovereign debt. DRW immediately withdrew all but about $9,500 from its MF Global account. DRW chief Don Wilson says such debacles could be prevented through more transparency about where and how brokers invest their customers’ money. “If we had been aware of the risks they were taking ... we would have pulled our money much sooner,” he said. Other firms pulled money from MF Global before the bankruptcy, as well. MF Global had $8.8 billion in customer funds at the end of July and only $7.2 billion by the end of August, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data shows. By its collapse, the amount was $5.5 billion, according to CME Group. Stricter rules — including holding CEOs accountable for safekeeping of segregated funds — and stricter punishments, including potential criminal sanctions, are among proposals under discussion by industry groups including the National Futures Association and the Commodity Customers Coalition, which represents former MF Global clients. Industry insiders say it is not unexpected that MF Global — which was among the top 10 U.S. futures brokers — would have large hedgers as clients. Such companies were generally equipped to handle the collapse better than smaller investors. To these titans, the money still tied up at the failed brokerage is fairly inconsequential. Unlike the smaller players who made up the majority of MF Global’s 30,000 customers, most of the big firms had accounts at several brokers and giant trading desks. ConocoPhillips, the world’s No. 5 refiner which earned $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, had accounts valued at $310 million with MF Global on October 31, including $195 million in letters of credit to guarantee its trades. ConocoPhillips spokesman Aftab Ahmed said the bankruptcy “did not impact any of our underlying operations.” He declined to say how much of that balance had been returned to ConocoPhillips. Global trading company ITOCHU International also said the impact on business operations was minimal. Yet, the collapse “changed our view that our accounts are fully secured,” in-house counsel Keisuke Nomura said. “We need to pay more attention to the credibility of the companies like MF Global,” he said. Most large investors have kept their exposure to MF Global under wraps, while farmers, ranchers and individual traders have sounded off to the media, the trustee and Congress over the $1.6 billion in customer money still missing. Yet these larger customers are critical to the futures industry, and to exchanges like CME Group Inc and IntercontinentalExchange Inc, which could suffer if big-name investors take their business off the exchanges to over-the-counter deals. In contrast, farmers and ranchers have few options besides the regulated markets to hedge their products. CME and ICE have been clearing more over-the-counter contracts, but their main futures business generates higher margins. “What the exchanges care about is volume,” said Craig Pirrong, a professor at University of Houston. “If one or two of these big guys move to the over-the-counter markets or cuts down trading substantially, it could be a big deal.” At a recent roundtable convened by the CFTC, players such as bond fund giant Pimco, mutual fund company Vanguard and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System made clear that their main concern was that their money would be as protected in the futures markets as it is in the over-the-counter markets. CME has been working to hasten the return of, and protect, all customer funds, a spokeswoman said. Former MF Global clients Coca Cola Co, Hormel, General Mills , Anheuser Busch, Tesoro and Marathon Petroleum declined to comment for this story or did not return calls for comment. One measure of how MF Global’s bankruptcy caught even savvy investors by surprise is the five CME Group directors who filed claims. Two of them — former vice chairman Charles Carey and director Joseph Niciforo — are suing the broker. Jack Sandner, a former CME chairman, and director Robert Corvino also had small claims, while director David Wescott had $2.1 million in an MF Global account. All declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. Glenn Pankau, whose brother Ron is on the CME board, had banked some $650,000 at his MF Global account, much more than the $50,000 he needed to secure his personal trades. “I was always told it was the safest place my money could be,” Pankau said. On the Friday before the bankruptcy, Glenn Pankau had a conversation with Wescott, a CME director and MF Global officer. Wescott told Pankau he should take his money out of MF Global if he was uncomfortable. Pankau tried, but the check bounced. To date Pankau has retrieved only 66 percent of his money from MF Global. Wescott has received none. Now, Pankau keeps only enough money at his new broker to back his trades. “I am not going to be victimized again,” he said.

135,KO,"Coke, Pepsi make changes to avoid cancer warning","(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc are making changes to the production of an ingredient in their namesake colas to avoid the need to label the packages with a cancer warning. The change will not be noticeable to consumers, according to statements from both companies. Coke and Pepsi said on Friday that they had asked their suppliers of the caramel coloring in their colas to alter their manufacturing process to meet the requirements of a California ballot initiative aiming to limit people’s exposure to toxic chemicals. “Consumers will notice no difference in our products and have no reason at all for any health concerns,” said PepsiCo spokeswoman Gina Anderson in a statement. The change is meant to reduce the amount of a chemical called 4-methylimidazole, or 4-MI, which in January was added to the list of chemicals covered by California’s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, also known as Proposition 65. High levels of that chemical have been linked to cancer in animals. The California statute says that “no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving a clear and reasonable warning ...” Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Sheidler said the modification to the manufacturing process will have no effect on the formula, color or taste of Coca-Cola. Both companies said they started in California, and would expand the use of the reduced 4-MI caramel coloring over time. Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc said all the caramel color being produced for it meets the new California standard. Earlier this week, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a U.S. watchdog group, said it found unsafe levels of the chemical in cans of Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, Dr Pepper and Whole Foods Markets Inc’s 365 Cola. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said at the time it was reviewing the group’s petition but stressed that the drinks were still safe. An FDA spokesman said a person would have to drink “well over a thousand cans of soda a day to reach the doses administered in the studies that have shown links to cancer in rodents”. Shares of Coke and Pepsi were both up less than 1 percent in afternoon trade, roughly in line with the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. Dr Pepper Snapple shares were up 1.1 percent at $38.12.

We believe that some price increases in 	 emerging regions will partially cushion the negative impact of weak demand on 	 the group’s revenues. In 2011 CCH’s adjusted EBITDA margin contracted by about 270 basis points 	 mainly as a result of inflation in the price of sugar, juice concentrate, and 	 PET resin. We anticipate that in 2012 the group is likely to face further 	 input cost inflation. Given heightened price sensitivity in most of the 	 group’s EU markets, we believe that any unhedged input cost increases in 2012 	 will likely be partly absorbed by the group and partly mitigated through 	 selective price increases and improved product mix. Standard & Poor’s base-case cash flow and capital-structure scenario	 We view weak consumer demand, commodity price inflation coupled with consumer 	 price sensitivity, and currency volatility as the most significant threats to 	 the group’s future cash flow generation. Despite pressure on the group’s cash 	 flows, we project that CCH is likely to maintain an adjusted debt to EBITDA of 	 below 2.5x and an adjusted funds from operations (FFO) to debt of close to 35% 	 in 2012. These are the metrics that we consider commensurate with the current 	 rating. In our projections we have assumed a low single digit decline in 	 volumes, stable revenues, and a modest contraction in margins in 2012. We have 	 also included capital expenditure (capex) of between EUR450 million and EUR500 	 million. This is based on CCH’s capex guidance of EUR1.45 billion over the next 	 three years. Liquidity The short-term rating on CCH is ‘A-1’. This reflects our long-term corporate 	 credit rating as well as our view that CCH’s liquidity is adequate, under our 	 criteria. We estimate CCH’s liquidity source over the next 12 months to 	 comprise: — Cash and cash equivalents of EUR476 million at the end of December 2011. — An undrawn five-year EUR500 million committed credit facility. — FFO of about EUR756 million based on preliminary results. We estimate CCH’s liquidity uses over the next 12 months to comprise: — Short-term debt of EUR322 million. — Capex of between EUR450 million to EUR500 million. — In addition, we consider CCH’s access to the commercial paper (CP) 	 market due to its EUR1 billion global CP program to be supportive of the group’s 	 liquidity profile. Based on drawings in the past, we do not anticipate that 	 the CP program will be drawn for more than the EUR500 million. Outlook The stable outlook on CCH reflects our view of the quality of the group’s cash 	 flows, which benefit from its leading market positions and the relatively 	 stable demand characteristics of the Non Alcoholic Ready to Drink beverage 	 markets in the company’s regions of operation. Despite continuing weak 	 macroeconomic conditions within several European markets, we project that in 	 2012 the group’s adjusted debt to EBITDA will likely remain below 2.5x and its 	 adjusted FFO to debt will likely be close to 35%, which we consider to be 	 commensurate with the current rating. Given that the ratings on CCH incorporate a level of implied support from 	 Coke, we could lower the ratings on CCH either due to a weakening of Coke’s 	 credit quality, or due to our view of reduced implicit support from Coke. We 	 could also lower the ratings on CCH if its credit metrics were to deteriorate 	 to levels that weakened its stand-alone credit profile. In our view, this 	 would most likely occur as a result of an unexpected sharp rise in commodity 	 prices and/or further deterioration of EU consumer confidence. Given the level of implied support from Coke that we already factor into our 	 current ratings on CCH, a potential upgrade is constrained by CCH’s existing 	 leverage policies, which weigh on CCH’s stand-alone rating.",3162012,http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWLA480920120316
140,KO,UPDATE 2-U.S. soda consumption fell faster in 2011,"* U.S. soda sales down 1 pct in 2011 - newsletter * Pricing up about 3 pct - newsletter * Coke, Pepsi shares up slightly, Dr Pepper shares down By Martinne Geller March 20 (Reuters) - U.S. carbonated soft drink consumption fell faster last year as strength in energy drinks failed to offset weakness in traditional sodas from Coca-Cola Co  and PepsiCo Inc, according to a leading beverage industry newsletter. Total sales volume of soda fell about 1 percent in 2011 to 9.27 billion cases, according to Beverage Digest, about the same level it was in 1996. Sales volume fell 0.5 percent in 2010. Excluding energy drinks such as Red Bull and Rockstar, soda volume was down 1.5 percent last year, Beverage Digest said. “Carbonated soft drinks, while still the biggest category, are playing a declining role in Americans’ beverage consumption,” the newsletter said on Tuesday. Soda sales in the United States grew about 3 percent annually throughout most of the 1990s but began to slow in 1999. Sales have been in decline since 2005 as increasingly health-conscious consumers turn to options they see as healthier, such as bottled water, juice and tea. Americans on average drank 714 eight-ounce servings of carbonated soft drinks last year, down from 728 in 2010, Beverage Digest said, noting that consumption was the lowest since 1987. At retail, revenue rose about 2 percent to $75.7 billion. Beverage Digest estimates that prices were up about 3 percent last year as manufacturers sought to pass through some of the increase in costs of raw materials including corn syrup, used as a sweetener. Those price increases likely contributed to the volume weakness. NON-CARBONATED DRINKS GET MORE ATTENTION Including bottled waters, juice drinks, teas and sports drinks, bottled beverage sales rose 0.8 percent to 15.2 billion cases in 2011, said Beverage Digest. That represented a slowdown from 2010, when sales rose 1.7 percent. According to separate data released on Tuesday from Beverage Marketing Corp, premium-priced drinks such as bottled tea and coffee, sports drinks and energy drinks performed well in 2011. Still, the research, consulting and financial services firm said the economy had an impact. “Higher prices did almost certainly contribute to 2011’s deceleration as lower-income consumers continued to struggle,” the company said. According to Beverage Digest, the top four sodas — Coke, Diet Coke, Pepsi-Cola and Mt. Dew — all saw declining sales last year. Of those, Coke’s market share was flat, while the other three all lost share. Including all bottled drinks, Coca-Cola Co cornered 34 percent of the market, followed by PepsiCo with nearly 27 percent, Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc with 11 percent, and Nestle Waters North America with about 10 percent. Nestle Waters, a unit of Switzerland’s Nestle, sells bottled water brands including Poland Spring, Perrier and Nestle Pure Life. Coke shares were up 13 cents to $70.53 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Pepsi shares were up 55 cents at $65.28. Dr Pepper Snapple shares were down 16 cents to $38.50.",3202012,http://www.reuters.com/article/drinks/update-2-u-s-soda-consumption-fell-faster-in-2011-idUSL1E8EK1P620120320

The Nasdaq got a lift from Green Mountain Coffee Roasters GMCR.O shares, which shot up 10 percent to $55.79 after the company said it will carry Starbucks-branded coffee in packs designed for its new line of brewers, boosting its efforts to protect its lead in the U.S. single-cup coffee market.

144,KO,Lawsuit says Simply Orange juice not so simple,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co’s Simply Orange juice brand isn’t simply orange juice, according to a lawsuit filed against the beverage company on Friday. Instead, the lawsuit in an Illinois federal court claims that the product undergoes extensive processing, and is dependent upon added aroma and flavoring in a way not found in nature. The plaintiff, a consumer, accuses Coca-Cola (KO.N) of fraud, and seeks class action status. The consumer, Randall Davis, had bought the product - whose label says “100% Pure Squeezed Orange Juice” - at stores “for personal, family, or household purposes,” the lawsuit said. Coca-Cola spokeswoman Susan Stribling said the company’s Simply and Minute Maid juices are properly labeled in full accordance with FDA regulations. “This lawsuit has nothing to do with misleading consumers and everything to do with lining class action lawyers’ pockets,” Stribling said. “It is a meritless case against which we will vigorously defend ourselves.” Lawsuits against food and beverage companies over alleged misleading marketing have drawn more attention, with sometimes dubious results for the plaintiffs. A suit accusing Taco Bell (YUM.N) of misrepresenting the amount of beef in its products received national headlines last year. But Taco Bell vehemently disputed the claims, which were soon voluntarily withdrawn by the plaintiff. The latest lawsuit said that chemically engineered “flavor packs” are added to Simply Orange, in order to mimic the flavor of natural orange juice. Consumers are willing to pay a premium price for Simply Orange, due in part to their false belief in the freshness of the product, the lawsuit said. “Coca-Cola misrepresented that Simply Orange was 100% pure and natural orange juice when in fact it was not,” the lawsuit said.

Companies including Coca-Cola Co, General Electric Co. and Johnson & Johnson have agreed to make available more details about areas like trade association memberships and top policy issues, according to a tally of 2012 reforms kept by activist investor Walden Asset Management. In return for the changes, the Boston fund shop said it or its investor allies agreed to withdraw proxy proposals they had submitted in advance of this spring’s season for corporate annual meetings. Though some of the lobbying information was already available in government databases, much of it was too obscure for the average investor to track down, said Tim Smith, senior vice president at Walden who helped lead the disclosure campaign. Smith said the company actions show the disclosures are not just a pet concern of so-called socially responsible investors. “This is significant because the companies see it as being a good business practice,” Smith said. Representatives for GE and J&J; did not respond to questions. A Coca-Cola spokeswoman said under a new policy it will report its efforts in areas like lobbying more clearly. “The Coca-Cola Company supports transparency relating to corporate political contributions and lobbying expenses,” she said. Another 22 company activists targeted for lobbying disclosure have not announced any changes or concessions yet. As a result, Smith said, the issue will be debated and voted on at their upcoming annual shareholder meetings. Groups allied with Walden that filed similar resolutions include the public-sector labor union the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; the New York State Common Retirement Fund; and several religious orders. In recent years, the investors have built a successful record of pressing for change on a variety of issues that are now common practice or law such as shareholder advisory votes on executive pay. Those votes and other scrutiny companies are getting from proxy-advisory firms are leading to a faster pace of governance changes, said Paul Hodgson, senior research associate at GMI Ratings. The New York-based organization tracks shareholder votes and has supported some changes such as separating the roles of chief executives and Board Chairmen — a major focus of AFSCME this year. “Companies know that giving in early or compromising is easier than the embarrassment of losing a high profile vote,” Hodgson said in an e-mail. Corporate spending to influence public policy has been a hot issue since a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision lifted limits on election spending by companies and unions. Smith and others are also part of an effort to get companies to agree to disclose political contributions led by the Center for Political Accountability in Washington. In March, it said 100 companies agreed to disclose direct political contributions and indirect spending through trade associations and similar groups. Among the companies where activists withdrew proxy proposals, the details vary and may be considered minor by some measures. For instance, Coca-Cola had already published a number of disclosures such as an online listing of its top policy priorities: corporate taxation, product-specific rules and environmental rules.

151,KO,Coke withdraws from group that backs Stand Your Ground law,"ORLANDO, Fla./NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co is dropping its membership in a conservative national advocacy group that supports “Stand Your Ground” laws such as the one being used as a defense in the Florida killing of an unarmed black teenager, Trayvon Martin. The move by the world’s biggest soft drink maker comes as corporate America faces increased scrutiny from consumers and shareholder activists over lobbying and political spending. PepsiCo Inc ended its relationship with the group - the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) - in January. In a statement on Thursday, Coca-Cola made no direct mention of the controversial self-defense law pushed by ALEC that provides shooters with wide latitude for claiming self defense when they perceive a threat. “The Coca-Cola Company has elected to discontinue its membership with the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC),” the statement said. “Our involvement with ALEC was focused on efforts to oppose discriminatory food and beverage taxes, not on issues that have no direct bearing on our business. We have a long-standing policy of only taking positions on issues that impact our company and industry.” Trayvon Martin, 17, was killed on February 26 in Sanford, Florida, by George Zimmerman, 28, a white and Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer who has claimed he acted in self defense and has not been charged with a crime. At a rally in Sanford on Saturday, civil rights leaders said they were considering economic boycotts of national companies that support “Stand Your Ground” laws. Coca-Cola and other ALEC member companies were targeted last year by the civil rights group ColorOfChange for their support of ALEC, which is also behind what ColorOfChange Executive Director Rashad Robinson calls “voter suppression laws” in many states. The laws require voters to show identification. Since Martin’s killing, Robinson said ColorOfChange has let the corporations know that ALEC was behind a push for states to adopt legislation modeled after Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law. Robinson declined to name which other companies the group is pursuing, saying their strategy is to give corporations a chance to withdraw from ALEC before escalating the issue publicly.

Pfizer reviews its membership in outside organizations regularly, he said. Reynolds, the maker of Camel cigarettes, said ALEC provides “a valuable forum for sharing of ideas and fostering better understanding of a broad range of both legislative and business issues.” Cigarette-maker Altria Group, which has an employee on the ALEC board, said its involvement is focused on business-related issues.

155,KO,Garage sale find: $130 million in Coke stock?,"(Reuters) - George Soros and John Paulson may have to make room for the late Tony Marohn, who possibly pulled off one of the greatest financial trades ever — at an estate sale. Marohn’s family claims it is owed a $130 million stake in Coca-Cola Co after Marohn bought an antique Palmer Union Oil Co stock certificate in 2008 for a “nominal amount,” Marohn family attorney David Margules said on Thursday. Marohn traced Palmer Union Oil to Coca-Cola, by way of long-forgotten companies such as Petrocarbon Chemicals Inc and Taylor Wine Co, according to court documents. Marohn died in 2010, and but his family in California has taken on the legal battle with Coca-Cola Co, saying it is entitled to about 1.8 million shares of the soft-drink maker. But before the family buys that vacation home in Aspen, they’ll have to convince a skeptical Delaware Chancery Court judge that the law is on their side. “This is a new version of the Beverly Hillbillies,” Judge Leo Strine said at a hearing on January 31, according to a court transcript. He was referring to a 1960s television comedy about a backwoods family that becomes rich by finding oil on their property. If upheld, Marohn’s estate would become among the largest non-institutional investors in Coca-Cola, according to Reuters data. “The claim of Mr. Marohn’s estate that it is entitled to millions of dollars in Coca-Cola stock - based on a canceled stock certificate for a long-defunct oil company purchased at an estate sale - is meritless and unfair to the Company’s millions of legitimate shareholders,” said a Thursday statement from Coca-Cola. Bob Kerstein, who runs the scripophily.com website, which researches and sells antique stock certificates, said he gets lots of inquiries from people who want to redeem old certificates. “We get people who have blank stock certificates and they think they have hit the lotto,” said Kerstein. He said he has to break the news to them they need to be on record with the company as well. Margules, the Wilmington, Delaware, attorney for Marohn’s estate, said he thinks he can persuade Strine that the law favors his client. Marohn’s certificate was endorsed and assigned, but the transferee was left blank. Marohn filled in his name and began digging through corporate records. He eventually wrote to Coca-Cola to demand 1.8 million shares of common stock for his 1,625 Palmer Union Oil shares. The company refused, and sued Marohn in Delaware’s Chancery Court in 2009 seeking a declaration he was not entitled to the company’s stock. Marohn’s estate filed papers last week showing courts have upheld that a person who was issued a stock certificate and then endorsed and assigned it — but left blank the name of the transferee — essentially transformed the certificate into a bearer stock. By writing his name on the stock, Marohn became the legal owner, his estate argued. Strine said in January he would soon decide how to proceed. He also warned the Marohn estate against pursuing “a drive by of a public company” to extract money to drop the case. “It’s just not a sport,” Strine said.

159,KO,CORRECTED-UPDATE 4-Coke withdraws from group that backs Stand Your Ground law,"By Barbara Liston and Martinne Geller ORLANDO, Fla./NEW YORK, April 5 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co  is dropping its membership in a conservative national advocacy group that supports “Stand Your Ground” laws such as the one being used as a defense in the Florida killing of an unarmed black teenager, Trayvon Martin. The move by the world’s biggest soft drink maker comes as corporate America faces increased scrutiny from consumers and shareholder activists over lobbying and political spending. PepsiCo Inc ended its relationship with the group - the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) - in January. In a statement on Thursday, Coca-Cola made no direct mention of the controversial self-defense law pushed by ALEC that provides shooters with wide latitude for claiming self defense when they perceive a threat. “The Coca-Cola Company has elected to discontinue its membership with the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC),” the statement said. “Our involvement with ALEC was focused on efforts to oppose discriminatory food and beverage taxes, not on issues that have no direct bearing on our business. We have a long-standing policy of only taking positions on issues that impact our company and industry.” Trayvon Martin, 17, was killed on Feb. 26 in Sanford, Florida, by George Zimmerman, 28, a white and Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer who has claimed he acted in self defense and has not been charged with a crime. At a rally in Sanford on Saturday, civil rights leaders said they were considering economic boycotts of national companies that support “Stand Your Ground” laws. Coca-Cola and other ALEC member companies were targeted last year by the civil rights group ColorOfChange for their support of ALEC, which is also behind what ColorOfChange Executive Director Rashad Robinson calls “voter suppression laws” in many states. The laws require voters to show identification. Since Martin’s killing, Robinson said ColorOfChange has let the corporations know that ALEC was behind a push for states to adopt legislation modeled after Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law. Robinson declined to name which other companies the group is pursuing, saying their strategy is to give corporations a chance to withdraw from ALEC before escalating the issue publicly. ALEC’s private enterprise board includes executives from companies including Pfizer Inc and Reynolds American , which stood by the group on Thursday along with Procter & Gamble Co, a member company. “We don’t agree with every ALEC position, but we participate in ALEC’s healthcare forums because state legislators that are the members in ALEC, they make decisions that impact our business and the country’s business every day,” said Peter O’Toole, a spokesman for the world’s largest drugmaker. Pfizer reviews its membership in outside organizations regularly, he said. Reynolds, the maker of Camel cigarettes, said ALEC provides “a valuable forum for sharing of ideas and fostering better understanding of a broad range of both legislative and business issues.” Cigarette-maker Altria Group, which has an employee on the ALEC board, said its involvement is focused on business-related issues. Exxon Mobil Corp declined to comment as did Diageo Plc, which makes Johnnie Walker whisky and Smirnoff vodka. Late on Thursday, Kraft Foods Inc said in an emailed statement: “We belong to many external groups, including ALEC, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that promotes growth and fiscal responsibility. “ALEC covers numerous issues but our involvement has been strictly limited to discussions about economic growth and development, transportation and tax policy. We did not participate in meetings or conversations related to other issues. “Our membership in ALEC expires this spring and for a number of reasons, including limited resources, we have made the decision not to renew.” Companies that were not immediately available for comment included Johnson & Johnson, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, United Parcel Service Inc, among others.() Bruce Freed, president of the Center for Political Accountability in Washington, said he was not surprised that Pepsi and Coke were ahead of the pack in distancing themselves from ALEC, because they could be more vulnerable to a consumer boycott than other companies. “Companies recognize that political spending poses a risk,” said Freed, whose group is also pressing companies t o disclose more about t heir spending. ALEC, which describes its mission as to advance the principles of free markets, limited government, federalism, and individual liberty, said it would welcome back Coke if it ever had a change of heart. “We definitely respect differences of opinion and ideas and whatever people want to do...,” said Kaitlyn Buss, spokeswoman for ALEC. ALEC develops model bills, but one of the group’s insiders said it does not actively lobby. “The legislators often have an idea, a concept or a thought and they go to ALEC to implement that thought,” said Victor Schwartz, a Washington lawyer and lobbyist who serves as co-chairman of the ALEC task force on civil justice. He was not speaking as an ALEC spokesman.

160,KO,Greek Coke bottler dismisses soft drinks report,"ATHENS, April 10 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Hellenic (CCH) , Coca-Cola’s No.2 bottler worldwide, dismissed on Tuesday a press report that soft drinks it recalled last month contained a substance which could be dangerous to public health. In February, CCH, which is active in 27 countries in Europe and also in Nigeria, removed from the market some of its Coca-Cola and Sprite plastic and glass bottles produced at a Greek unit, citing an unusual taste. A report on Proto Thema newspaper over the weekend said the drinks could cause serious health problems if consumed in large quantities. “These specific products never posed a risk to public health. This has been confirmed in laboratory tests by the country’s chemistry laboratory and certified international and Greek scientific organisations,” CCH said in a statement. A Greek prosecutor ordered a preliminary investigation on Tuesday following the report. The country’s food regulator had said in February that consumers had complained about a bad taste and odour in CCH’s soft drinks, which the bottler attributed to the presence of two chemical substances, dicholorophenol 2.4 and 2.6. But the bottler said the beverages were safe and that it had preventively pulled them from the market.

The maker of Sprite, Minute Maid orange juice and vitaminwater, which does business in more than 200 countries, saw volume rise 3 percent in Germany and Japan, 6 percent in Spain and 1 percent in the United States, in a sign that consumers may be opening their wallets again after economic uncertainty curbed demand. “Despite its struggle with a sustained period of relative high unemployment, we are pleased to see some early signs of a slowly improving macroeconomic environment,” Coke Chief Executive Muhtar Kent said about the United States. U.S. consumers are eating out and traveling more, Kent said, which bodes well for consumption of bottled drinks. The trend should continue, he added, as long as gasoline prices stay where they are, just under $4 per gallon on average. At the same time, performance in China may weaken as that country’s economic growth slows from the meteoric rates seen in recent years. “As we move through 2012, we anticipate that our business in China may not be immune to this cooling economy and therefore, we may also see some of our volume results in China moderate to some extent,” Kent said. He added that results in Brazil should remain steady as that country’s economy recovers. Emerging markets are still what drives Coca-Cola’s growth, said Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj, but he said the pickup in mature markets was a good sign. “That’s an interesting message for us, not just for Coke but more broadly for consumer packaged goods,” Dibadj said. “I don’t think the U.S. is back to what it used to be, in terms of growth, but this would suggest that things are getting a little bit better.” Any improvement would also be most welcome to PepsiCo Inc , whose North American drink business has lagged Coke’s. The maker of Tropicana juice, Frito-Lay chips and Quaker oatmeal, which will report earnings next week, is boosting its marketing budget this year in order to help lift sales. Coke shares were up $1.98, or 2.7 percent, at $74.42 in early afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Coca-Cola’s first-quarter net profit was $2.05 billion, or 89 cents per share, up from $1.90 billion, or 82 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 6 percent to $11.14 billion, helped by a 5 percent increase in overall volume and a 3 percent increase in prices and mix of products sold. Analysts on average expected earnings of 87 cents per share on revenue of $10.82 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In the key North American market, operating income declined 9 percent, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, due to higher costs for commodities such as packaging and sweetener and one less selling day. Excluding those factors, profit would have been up, Coke said. Consumer Edge Research analyst Bill Pecoriello said Coke’s “profit growth was quite strong” considering the impact of those factors. Coke stood by its 2012 outlook for commodity cost inflation of $350 million to $450 million and a mid-single-digit percentage rate hit on operating income from foreign exchange rates. But Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said the commodity picture could slowly improve in coming months. For the current second quarter, Fayard said the hit to earnings from foreign exchange rate changes would be at the high end of the mid-single-digit range. Coca-Cola also said it was on track with a productivity program aiming to save $550 million to $650 million a year by the end of 2015.",4172012,http://www.reuters.com/article/cocacola/update-4-coke-beats-street-sees-signs-us-economy-improving-idUSL2E8FH19C20120417

171,KO,Coke says not in talks to buy Monster Beverage,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co took the unusual step of shooting down a report on Monday that said it was in talks to buy energy drink maker Monster Beverage Corp, valued at more than $11 billion. The statement from the world’s largest soft drink maker came in response to a story in the Wall Street Journal that said Coke was in discussions to buy the fast growing energy drink maker, whose brands include Monster Energy and Java Monster. Coke and Monster had discussed a possible deal as recently as last year, according to two sources familiar with the matter. However, it is unclear whether the two have been in talks since then. The Journal’s report that the two companies were in current talks, posted on its website Monday, sent Monster’s stock up 28 percent to $83.96, an all-time high. Coke later issued a statement disputing the report, and Monster stock fell, closing down 1 percent. “At this time, we are not in discussions to acquire the Monster Beverage Corp,” Coke said in its statement. “We continue to review the best ways to maximize the value of our relationship.” Should it happen, an acquisition would give Coke a bigger footprint in the energy drink market, which is growing faster than traditional soft drinks. Coke’s own energy drink, Full Throttle, is small compared with Monster and rivals Red Bull and Rockstar. “We think Monster is an attractive takeout candidate given it is the fastest-growing brand in one of the fastest-growing global beverage categories,” said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Astrachan. UBS analyst Kaumil Gajrawala estimated a fair takeout offer for Monster would range from $84 to $100 per share. Based on the number of shares outstanding as of February 24, that multiple implies a deal value ranging from $14.6 billion to $17.4 billion. Coke already distributes a large portion of Monster’s drinks in the United States and in some international markets. Monster has a similar distribution deal with Anheuser-Busch InBev. In its statement, Coke said the two companies were looking at ways to wring more profit out of their existing relationship. That could include placing Monster in more retail locations, doing additional co-marketing with other Coke brands, or working together to market new products, according to Ken Harris, chief executive of Kantar Retail Americas Consulting. However, the dueling statements on a possible acquisition left some doubt about whether a deal might be in the works. Following Coke’s denial of acquisition talks, the Wall Street Journal updated its story to say the companies had been in talks recently and that Coke pulled out after the Journal report was published. A Coke spokesman denied that claim. A Monster spokeswoman said the company does not comment on market speculation. Monster Beverage, earlier known as Hansen Natural, was taken public by current CEO Rodney Sacks in 1992. Sacks, now in his 60s, still has a 7.3 percent stake in the company, according to Thomson Reuters data. Speculation about whether Coca-Cola would buy Monster has surfaced in the past due to Monster’s growth, the companies’ distribution relationship, and the fact that Coke does not have a very strong-selling energy drink. Last year, Monster’s sales rose by nearly a third to $1.70 billion. Sales are seen rising a further 21 percent this year. For Monster, getting bought by Coca-Cola would greatly expand its presence, since it would have access to Coke’s sizable international distribution system. For Coke, buying Monster would give it the full profit stream from the product. Analysts have said buying Monster would give Coke a good brand in North America, where sales of traditional soft drinks have been weak, as well as a good product to sell overseas. Monster’s shares nearly doubled over the past year. As of Friday’s close, the company’s market capitalization was about $11.4 billion based on the latest number of share outstanding. Monster shares closed down 0.8 percent at $65. Coke shares closed down 0.4 percent at $76.32 on the New York Stock Exchange.

An acquisition of Monster, which had a market capitalization of more than $11 billion, would be the largest brand acquisition for Coca-Cola, according to the paper, and would give the world’s biggest soft-drink maker greater exposure to the growing energy drink market. A Monster spokeswoman said it is the company’s policy not to comment on rumors. A spokesman for Coca-Cola was not immediately available to comment. Monster Beverage, earlier known as Hansen Natural, was taken public by current CEO Rodney Sacks in 1992. Sacks still has a 7.3 percent stake in the company, according to Thomson Reuters data. Speculation about whether Coca-Cola would buy Monster has surfaced in the past, due to Monster’s high growth and the fact that Coca-Cola distributes Monster’s energy drinks. The company’s shares nearly doubled over the past year even before Monday’s jump.

The production plant is the first major industrial investment for the enclave, which declared independence from Somalia in 1991, but has not been recognised internationally. “This investment will create an estimated 135 direct jobs and 2,500 indirect jobs, and will contribute to a healthy distribution and retail sector in Somaliland. Our commitment to the continent of Africa remains enduring and unshakable,” said Nathan Kalumbu, regional president for the company. Coca-Cola carried out the investment with local partner Somaliland Beverage Industries, based on a franchising agreement, it said. Ahmed Guelleh, the chairman of Somaliland Beverage, said the plant would also help the breakaway enclave to build a manufacturing capacity.

182,KO,Coke fires back at proposed NYC big soda ban,"* Coke says consumers already see calorie counts * Observers say impact from proposal will take years to know * Coke, PepsiCo shares down slightly NEW YORK, May 31 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co fired back at the Bloomberg administration on Thursday, saying its proposed ban of large-sized soft drinks insulted New Yorkers. “New Yorkers expect and deserve better than this. They can make their own choices about the beverages they purchase,” Coca-Cola said in a statement. The world’s largest soft-drink maker, which would also be disproportionately affected by such a ban, pointed out that it already includes calorie counts on the front of its bottles and cans in New York and that restaurants already post the calorie content of all their offerings and portion sizes, including soft drinks. The statement from Coke comes a day after New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he was proposing an amendment to the city’s health code to prohibit food service outlets from selling sugary soft drinks larger than 16 ounces. The ban would apply to restaurants, mobile food carts, delis and concessions at movie theaters, stadiums or arenas, where sales of fountain drinks are common. It would not apply to convenience stores, grocery stores or drug stores, which mostly sell beverages in bottles and cans. PepsiCo declined to comment, referring questions to the New York City Beverage Association. Coke dominates the nation’s soda fountains with a 70 percent share of the market, according to Beverage Digest, followed by PepsiCo Inc with 19 percent and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc with 11 percent. Fountain business accounts for about 24 percent of the 9.3 billion cases of soda sold a year, Beverage Digest said. The total market is worth about $75.7 billion. Beverage Digest publisher John Sicher called the proposal misguided. He said its impact on the beverage industry will not be known for several years. “I think that it would have some impact, but how much, we’re really not going to know until we can gauge the impact in New York and see whether it spreads.” The proposal will be submitted to the New York City Board of Health on June 12. The board will go through a three-month comment period and vote on the proposal.",5312012,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-sugarban-reaction/coke-fires-back-at-proposed-nyc-big-soda-ban-idUSL1E8GVA8U20120531

192,KO,U.S. group flags chemical levels in Coke sold abroad,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co’s namesake soda sold in several countries, including Brazil and Kenya, still contains a high level of a chemical linked to cancer in animals months after it made changes to the drinks sold in California, a U.S. watchdog group said on Tuesday. The Center for Science in the Public Interest said that samples of Coca-Cola tested in nine countries showed “alarming amounts” of the chemical 4-methylimidazole, or 4-MI, used as an ingredient in caramel coloring. High levels of that chemical have been linked to cancer in animals. In March, both Coca-Cola and rival PepsiCo Inc said that they had asked suppliers of the caramel coloring to alter their manufacturing process to meet the requirements of a California ballot initiative aiming to limit people’s exposure to toxic chemicals. Coca-Cola said at the time that it would start in California and expand the use of the reduced 4-MI caramel coloring over time. It did not specify a timetable. Coca-Cola repeated on Tuesday that the caramel coloring in all of its products was safe and that it had asked suppliers to change their manufacturing process to comply with California’s labeling requirement. According to CSPI, sample bottles from California tested this spring showed only 4 micrograms of 4-MI per 12 ounces. California requires a warning label if a food would lead to people consuming 30 micrograms or more a day. But samples from Brazil contained 267 micrograms and samples from Kenya had 177 micrograms, CSPI said. Even in the United States, samples from Washington D.C. had 145 micrograms. CSPI Executive Director Michael Jacobson said consumers in some other countries drink much less soda than those in the United States, so they have less exposure to the chemical. “But now that we know it’s possible to almost totally eliminate this carcinogen from colas, there’s no excuse for Coca-Cola and other companies not to do so worldwide, and not just in California,” he said in a statement. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering a petition by the watchdog group to ban the process that creates the heightened 4-MI levels, but said that there is no reason to believe there is any immediate or short-term danger to consumers. Earlier this year, an FDA spokesman said a person would have to drink “well over a thousand cans of soda a day to reach the doses administered in the studies that have shown links to cancer in rodents”. Coca-Cola said on Tuesday it was still working on the logistics of introducing the new caramel coloring. “We intend to expand the use of the modified caramel globally to allow us to streamline and simplify our supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution systems,” the company said in a statement. A spokeswoman declined to say how much the switch would cost.

The investment by Coca-Cola and its bottlers, on top of a $2 billion five-year plan announced in November, will hearten Indian officials who are trying to restore investor confidence after growth fell to a nine-year low in the first quarter. Coca-Cola’s announcement comes days after Swedish retailer IKEA, the world’s largest furniture maker, said it would invest 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) to open 25 stores in Asia’s third-largest economy over 15 to 20 years. “We have increased the investment here because we think, there’s potential here to stay ahead of the curve,” Coca-Cola Chairman and Chief Executive Muhtar Kent told reporters in the Indian capital. Coca-Cola and its bottlers have spent some $2 billion since the company returned to India in 1993 after pulling out in 1977 when a government ruling would have forced it to share its secret formula. Coca-Cola lags rival PepsiCo’s brand Pepsi in India’s $10 billion beverages market and it has been trying to aggressively raise its market share - cutting some prices in the summer season for the first time since 2003. “The brand that has been doing well for Coca-Cola is Thums Up,” said an analyst with a foreign brokerage, who did not wish to be named, referring to a local cola brand owned by the Atlanta-based company.

Kent said Coca-Cola, which also sells brands such as Minute Maid juices and Nestea, was on track to meet its target of doubling its business in a decade with global investment alongside its bottlers of $30 billion in the next five years.

The tie-up will be discussed by Mexico’s Federal Competition Commission on Thursday, the watchdog said on its website. Jugos del Valle’s Mexican operations are joint-owned by Coke , Mexico’s Coca Cola Femsa and other Mexican Coke bottlers. The deal would give Coke Femsa, the largest Coke bottler in Latin America, exposure to Mexico’s dairy market. The cash-rich bottler has been on a buying spree in the last year.

200,KO,Olympics-IOC chief backs Games food and drinks sponsors,"BERLIN, July 10 (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee issued public backing of its Games sponsors Coca-Cola and McDonald’s on Tuesday, a day after President Jacques Rogge was quoted as saying there was a “question mark” over their sponsorship due to obesity concerns. “I would like to clarify comments attributed to me in several media reports regarding Coca-Cola’s and McDonald’s Olympic sponsorship,” said Rogge in a statement mailed to Reuters. “The IOC hugely values the long-term sponsorship and support of both McDonald’s and Coca-Cola. Through the years we have personally witnessed the positive impact that they make as TOP sponsors,” said the IOC president. On Monday Rogge had been quoted in several British media as saying there had been a “question mark” over the sponsorship of the Olympics by McDonald’s and Coca-Cola, driven by global obesity concerns. His comments come less than three weeks before the start of the London Olympics on July 27. “For those companies, we’ve said to them: ‘Listen, there is an issue in terms of the growing trend on obesity, what are you going to do about that?’” he was quoted by several media on Monday as saying. The IOC has regularly had to answer questions regarding the sponsor agreements with the two food and beverage companies for the world’s biggest mutli-sports event and whether their association with the Olympics, promoting a healthy lifestyle, was compatible. On Tuesday Rogge said the IOC was proud to be associated with them. “Both companies bring forward the spirit of the Olympic Games through creative and engaging global programs that promote physical activity and the values that the Olympic Games are all about.” “We are proud to work with both Coca-Cola and McDonald’s, with whom we have long term agreements in place through 2020.” McDonald’s, whose four restaurants in London’s Olympic Park include its biggest in the world, extended its 36-year backing of the Games in January by signing up as sponsor for another eight years. Soft drinks company Coca-Cola has been sponsoring the Olympics since 1928 and also has a deal to 2020.

Myanmar, emerging from decades of military rule and one of only three countries in which the company has no operations, was an attractive market for Coca-Cola, but it would not rush into hasty agreements, said Manuel Arroyo, president of Coca-Cola’s ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Business Unit. “The potential of the market, there’s no doubt, but obviously we need to walk a very clear, open and transparent line before operating there,” he told Reuters in an interview during a meeting of U.S. businesses in Cambodia. “We’re assessing different options with potential partners, or whether we go on our own. “Of course all of this will require quite a lot of work, and many, many months ... to do the proper due diligence,” he added. “We’re still in the very embryonic stage.” He said the firm would work closely with the U.S. State Department to make sure prospective partners were appropriate, as required by new U.S. rules on investing in Myanmar, a country of 60 million people, announced by President Barack Obama this week. Myanmar’s quasi-civilian government took office in March 2011 and has started overhauling its economy, easing media censorship, legalizing trade unions and protests and freeing political prisoners. Among the local soft drinks companies that could be Coca-Cola’s partners were Pinya Manufacturing Co, Myanmar Golden Star (MGS) and Loi Hein Company. “But we’ve seen more than three,” said Arroyo. “We’re still working internally to decide who would be our best partner, or whether to go alone.” Despite ceasing operations in 1960, Coca-Cola drinks have been smuggled into Myanmar for years over the border from Thailand.

204,KO,Coca-Cola's global reach offset European weakness,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co reported a higher-than-expected second quarter profit on Tuesday as rising consumption of its drinks in emerging markets offset declines in Europe. But the world’s largest soft drink company, maker of Sprite, Minute Maid orange juice and vitamin water, said tough economic conditions were taking a toll, dampening the enthusiasm of investors, who sent the shares up nearly 3 percent in morning trading. “We recognize that consumers across the globe continue to feel the effects and impacts of prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the further cooling of the economy in China and the protracted recovery here in the United States,” said Coke Chief Executive Muhtar Kent. Coke shares were up $1.39, or 1.8 percent, at $77.87 in afternoon trading, after rising as high as $78.66 earlier in the session. Kent told Reuters the connectedness of the modern world was contributing to the economic strife. “We’ve always been used to crises coming and passing like a river, and then going, until the next one. But I think more and more, we’re seeing that the world is a much more connected place,” Kent said. He added that, after years of astronomical growth in China, it was natural for the economy to slow a bit. “When you get up higher, the oxygen gets thinner,” he said. Coke Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said the company’s full-year gross margin would be smaller than in the second-quarter, due to currency fluctuations and more people buying larger, take-home bottles of soda instead of smaller, higher-margin drinks for immediate consumption. When U.S. gasoline prices eased in May and June, Coke expected to see a boost in sales at convenience stores and gas stations, but that did not happen, he said. Coke said it would face continued pressure on margins in the third quarter. “While (third-quarter estimates) may need to come down, we think the quarter was better than feared,” said JP Morgan analyst John Faucher. Coke’s second-quarter sales volume rose 4 percent, with North America growing 1 percent and international up 5 percent. Volume jumped 12 percent in Eurasia and Africa, 8 percent in the Pacific region and 3 percent in Latin America. It fell 4 percent in Europe due to the economic slowdown and cold weather. Still, the company gained market share on a global basis. “It looks like they had a good quarter in spite of the European woes. They continue to grow,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. “I’m still extremely optimistic.” Bradshaw said Coke is now the top holding of the relatively new Hodges Equity Income Fund, which is worth about $16 million. Performance in Europe was worse than expected and there were slight slowdowns in China and Mexico, said Bernstein Research analyst Ali Dibadj. But, overall, it was better than expected. “You have to consider the environment that we’re in,” Dibadj said. “This is a company that through all this macroeconomic stress, continues to grow fairly well with relatively little volatility.” Net income was $2.79 billion, down from $2.80 billion a year earlier. Net earnings per share rose to $1.21 from $1.20 because of fewer shares outstanding. Excluding items, earnings were $1.22 per share, topping the analysts’ average estimate of $1.19, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose about 3 percent to $13.09 billion. Analysts had expected $12.98 billion. The company said foreign exchange rates shaved 4 percentage points from net revenue. It forecast a hit of 8 percent to 9 percent on operating income for the third quarter and another dent at the high end of the mid-single-digit range for year. Price increases helped to boost sales. Costs rose 5 percent in the quarter, due to “moderately” higher commodity costs. Still, Coke lowered its commodity cost forecast to a rise of $300 million this year from its previous $350 million to $450 million increase. Kent declined to comment on the recent spike in corn prices, which could raise the cost of high-fructose corn syrup used in many drinks.

British lobby group 38 Degrees has gathered almost 165,000 signatures for an online petition under the banner “Stop Olympic Tax Dodging” urging sponsors to turn down the tax breaks. It claimed victory on Wednesday, posting “Two down!” after both companies confirmed they would not be using the exemption. However, both companies said they had not planned to use the exemption, a condition of London’s bid to host the Games, and denied that they had been influenced by the campaign. “Coca-Cola has never intended to, and will not be making, any corporate or income tax exemption claim with respect to any activity concerning our involvement with the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games,” the soft drinks company said. McDonald’s also said its decision was made some time ago and pre-dated the protest. The fast food chain said its revenue from the Games would be less than 0.1 percent of its annual UK sales. The company will be setting up four temporary restaurants at the Olympic Park during the Olympics which start on July 27. Coca-Cola and McDonald’s are two of 11 international companies who pay almost $1 billion to sponsor Winter and Summer Olympics over a four-year cycle. International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Jacques Rogge has praised the two companies after he was initially quoted as saying there was a “question mark” over their sponsorship due to obesity concerns. Foreign athletes competing in the Games are also exempt from  British income tax. Sports stars who come to Britain for other tournaments are normally liable to pay tax on their earnings and a proportion of their worldwide endorsement income.",7182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/oly-tax-mcdonalds-adv09/olympics-coke-mcdonalds-waive-uk-tax-exemption-idUSL6E8IIHHD20120718

Coke-Femsa, a joint venture of The Coca-Cola Co and Mexican retailer Femsa, said second-quarter profit slipped to 2.713 billion pesos ($203 million) from 2.749 billion pesos in the year-earlier period. The company went on a buying spree last year and its purchase of smaller bottlers Grupo Tampico and Grupo Cimsa helped boost sales. Revenue rose 28 percent to 36.3 billion pesos. Offsetting the higher sales, Coke Femsa said, was a one-time charge of 469 million pesos in the quarter related to labor law changes in Venezuela. The company also spent more in the quarter servicing its debt. Coke Femsa shares closed down 0.47 percent at 164.76 pesos in local market trading. The company has continued looking for acquisitions this year. Earlier this month it announced Jugos del Valle, its juice company with Coca-Cola, bought Mexican dairy company Santa Clara.

217,KO,SunTrust speeds up sale of Coke shares for $1.9 billion gain,"(Reuters) - SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N) has accelerated a planned sale of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) shares it owns in a move that it said will produce a $1.9 billion pre-tax gain and reduce volatility in its capital ratios. The Atlanta-based regional bank also said it planned to take a $375 million charge in the third quarter to cover requests from Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB to buy back mortgages it sold to the mortgage giants before 2009. SunTrust is also taking $350 million in charges as it sells off a variety of real estate loans. The actions are expected to increase the bank’s third-quarter net income by $750 million, or $1.40 per share, and produce a “modest increase” to Tier 1 common equity, a measure of core capital. “These actions better position SunTrust for the future by further improving our risk profile and strengthening our balance sheet while keeping regulatory capital ratios stable,” SunTrust Chief Executive Officer William Rogers Jr said in a statement. SunTrust has owned shares of beverage giant Coca-Cola since 1919 when a predecessor bank participated in the underwriting of the company’s initial public offering and received the shares in lieu of fees. But in 2008, the bank entered agreements with a third party to sell its 60 million shares in 2014 and 2015. After a recent review, the bank said it decided to move up the sales because new Basel III capital rules increased the perceived riskiness of the holdings.

223,KO,TEXT-Fitch:Coca-Cola Hellenic move is limited precedent for now,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Oct 12 - Coca-Cola Hellenic’s decision to relocate from Greece  to Switzerland, and the recent relocation by fellow Greek corporate FAGE, are  limited precedents for other eurozone corporates for now, despite incentives to  reduce share price discounts or protect against the risk of a full-blown  sovereign crisis, Fitch Ratings says. Redomiciling, as opposed to simply seeking listings on foreign exchanges, could  mitigate the impact of a euro exit for issuers with substantial offshore  operations and cash flow. This is the case for Coca-Cola Hellenic, which has  operations in 28 countries and is seeking a premium listing in London as well as  relocating to Switzerland, to reflect its international status and improve its  access to capital markets. Reflecting the severity of the crisis in Greece, Coca-Cola Hellenic - which has  in any event been a stand-out case of diversification away from its home market  - follows a similar move by FAGE, a much smaller international dairy company.  FAGE announced a restructuring to move ultimate ownership of subsidiaries to a  Luxembourg parent company. Outside the highly-stressed situation in Greece, larger blue-chip corporates,  especially those with a significant domestic presence, would face strong  political resistance as well as the possibility of tax crystallisations and the  complexity of debt novation. The prospect of creeping forms of taxation in an  austerity-inflicted country is not yet a sufficient incentive. Smaller companies  are likely to see limited benefits to their share prices or lending conditions,  unless, like FAGE, they can demonstrate that the majority of revenues come from  outside their home jurisdiction. We expect peripheral eurozone corporates, in the first instance, to focus on  reducing capital expenditure and dividend payments, which can preserve  standalone credit profiles by offsetting the impact of a weak economy on  revenues. Divestments, minority stake sales, and diversifying cash holdings away  from the domestic banking system, are also popular measures to ensure liquidity. Relocation of listings and accessing capital through subsidiaries in other  jurisdictions were scenarios that came to the fore in Fitch’s ‘war game’  exercise in August, which identified the likely responses to a hypothetical  euro-exit crisis and the effectiveness of those responses in disentangling  corporates from the sovereign risk of their home jurisdictions. Fitch has also reiterated its fundamentals-driven approach to rating links  between eurozone corporate ratings and their respective sovereigns, which leads  to significant levels of independence between ratings actions on each.

226,KO,Coca-Cola's revenue misses Wall Street expectations,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported quarterly revenue that came in short of Wall Street expectations on Tuesday, hurt by declines in Europe and Asia where it sold more lower-priced drinks amid economic uncertainty the company expects to continue into 2013. The world’s biggest soft-drink maker, with brands such as Sprite, Fanta and Minute Maid, also said revenue and profit were hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar, which reduces the value of overseas sales. Still, earnings were in line with analysts’ expectations and Coca-Cola shares fell only 27 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $37.86 on the New York Stock Exchange. Coca-Cola gets most of its sales from outside the United States, so shifts in currency can have a big effect. In the third quarter that ended on September 28, the strong dollar shaved 5 percentage points of growth from net revenue and 7 points from operating income. Aside from currency, results in Asia, particularly China, disappointed some analysts, though Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said it was not surprising, given the softening of consumer sentiment and the slowing of an economy that had been a growth engine for multinational companies in recent years. “China is slowing down a little bit for the long-term benefit of China. As China will settle, there’s a little bit of adjustment,” Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent told Reuters. “Take a plane — when it leaves cruising altitude and is going to land, the ride gets rougher. But it will settle.” Kent said he expects settling into a lower growth rate will happen within the next few months. Sales volume rose 3 percent in the Pacific region; JP Morgan analyst John Faucher expected 4.5 percent growth. In addition, European consumers have been hurt by the debt crisis. In the latest quarter, consumers were buying bottled soft drinks to take home, which is less profitable for the company than drinks sold in restaurants. “Go to Madrid and look at the cafes. There aren’t a lot of people sitting around drinking Cokes or coffee or whatever,” Gary Fayard, chief financial officer, said on a conference call. Also, European sales are growing most Eastern and Central Europe where prices are lower, Kent said. This helps volume of sales but hurts revenue. Third-quarter net income for Coca-Cola was $2.31 billion, or 50 cents per share, up from $2.22 billion, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 51 cents per share, in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 1 percent to $12.34 billion. Analysts were expecting $12.41 billion. Worldwide sales volume rose 4 percent in the quarter, driven by gains in all regions. Volume rose 1 percent in Europe, 2 percent in North America, 5 percent in Latin America and 11 percent in the Eurasia and Africa region. Sales volume in the Philippines was flat, due to typhoons. In Japan, soda volume fell 5 percent from the year-earlier period when new products boosted sales. Volume rose 2 percent in China. Closer to home, North American revenue and profit rose, helped by a recent acquisition and the impact of certain commodities hedges. Coke is also seeing tougher competition from PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, which is working hard to improve its North American beverage business. It has increased marketing spending with a focus on core brands like Pepsi-Cola and analysts have been saying that the renewed effort is working. Through Monday's close, Coke shares were up 9 percent year-to-date, while the Dow Jones U.S. Beverage Index .DJUSBV gained 10 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX rose 14.5 percent.

230,KO,SunTrust sees further margin compression; shares fall,"(Reuters) - SunTrust Banks Inc’s (STI.N) third-quarter profit surged on the sale of its shares in Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), but the lender forecast a weaker margin for the current quarter and said loan demand had slowed. Shares of the Atlanta-based lender fell as much as 4 percent to $27.20 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. As the U.S. Federal Reserve keeps interest rates low to boost the economy, bank margins are narrowing. SunTrust’s third-quarter net interest margin - the difference between what it pays out on deposits and earns on loans - fell 11 basis points to 3.38 percent. The bank said it expects further margin compression from the fourth quarter. “We expect to see a reduction in the net interest margin on the order of mid-single-digit basis points, driven by additional reductions in asset yields that will partially be offset by lower liability costs,” Chief Financial Officer Aleem Gillani said on a post-earnings conference call with analysts. “In the fourth quarter, we expect a reduction to net interest income,” Gillani added. The lender said commercial and industrial loan demand was slowing as borrowers pulled back on “fiscal cliff” fears. The fiscal cliff refers to the $500 billion or so of tax hikes and the more than $100 billion in government spending cuts that will automatically start on January 2 unless politicians agree on a budget deal. SunTrust’s third-quarter profit was boosted by a $1.9 billion pre-tax gain related to the sale of its Coca-Cola shares. Net income rose sharply to $1.07 billion, or $1.98 per share, from $211 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting the regional bank to earn $1.99 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The lender accelerated the sale of the shares, originally set for 2014 and 2015, to reduce volatility in its capital adequacy ratios ahead of the implementation of the new Basel III rules. SunTrust has owned shares in Coca-Cola since 1919 when a predecessor bank participated in the underwriting of the company’s initial public offering and received the shares in lieu of fees. The bank said in September that it would record the gain and a $375 million charge in the quarter to cover requests from Fannie Mae FNMA.OB and Freddie Mac FMCC.OB to buy back mortgages it sold to the regulators before 2009. The bank’s credit quality continued to improve. Non-performing loans were just 1.42 percent of its total loan book, down from 2.76 percent a year earlier. SunTrust, which suffered large losses due to the financial crisis, was one of the four big U.S. banks whose capital plans, including raising dividends and buying back shares, were rejected by the Federal Reserve in March as part of its stress-test reviews.

The company, a joint venture of Coca-Cola Co and Mexican retailer and beverage company Femsa, said earnings increased to 3.54 billion pesos ($276 million) from 2.31 billion pesos a year earlier. The results beat market expectations. Analysts polled by Reuters were looking for earnings of 3.15 billion pesos. Revenue jumped 20 percent to 36.19 billion pesos, helped by the integration of Mexican rivals Grupo Tampico, Grupo CIMSA and Grupo Fomento Queretano, the company said. About 1,000 people have been laid off as a result of these transactions so far this year and more headcount reduction could take place in the current quarter, the company said. The company, which is in talks to buy a controlling stake in Coca-Cola Co operations in the Philippines, said it expected a decision on the deal by year-end. “We think it has a very good potential ... we are finalizing negotiations with Coca-Cola Co. As they say in baseball, it’s not over till it’s over,” the company said during a conference call with analysts Wednesday morning. This deal could mean the beginning of more activity in Asia for the Mexican company although it did not give details about a possible next target. Coca-Cola FEMSA added during the call that while there were limited purchase chances left in Latin America, it would continue to tread the region for more opportunities. The company operates in Mexico, Central America, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina. Analysts have said acquisitions combined with more-stable prices of raw materials have greatly helped the company’s results in recent quarters. “After facing a very tough commodity and volatile currency environment over the past several quarters, we look forward to a strong close of the year,” said Carlos Salazar, chief executive officer. Coca-Cola Femsa shares, up 29 percent so far this year, rose 0.34 percent to 172.26 pesos on Wednesday.

238,KO,"Wal-Mart moves up dividend to avoid ""fiscal cliff'","(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Monday became the biggest corporation yet to move its planned dividend into late December from early January to help shareholders avoid a looming jump in the tax rate due to the so-called fiscal cliff. The shift by the world’s largest retailer will give shareholders, including the family of founder Sam Walton, roughly $1.34 billion in total dividend payments taxed at the current rate. Fiscal years for retailers typically end in late January, so their dividend payments often are timed differently from those of other types of companies. Exxon Mobil Corp, for instance, had already planned for payouts in December. “There are complex fiscal and federal tax rate issues that may not be resolved in the next few weeks, despite the ongoing good faith negotiations between the administration and Congress to resolve details related to the fiscal cliff,” Wal-Mart said in a statement. “In light of this uncertainty, the board determined that moving our dividend payment up by a few days to 2012 was in the best interests of our shareholders.” Teen apparel chains Hot Topic Inc and The Buckle Inc already said they would move dividends typically paid in January into December to allow shareholders to benefit from the lower tax rate set to expire this year. Adding to what has become a clamor for the White House and legislators on Capitol Hill to compromise, the Fitch ratings agency said on Monday that the “fiscal cliff” could trigger a recession and push the unemployment rate above 10 percent. Fitch said it did not expect the tax hikes and spending cuts to occur. The investment firm Morgan Stanley Smith Barney also said in a market commentary on Monday that it thought Washington would “act to mitigate and delay” the cliff. Robert Greifeld, chief executive of NASDAQ, the second-largest stock exchange, called on Democrats and Republicans to rediscover the ability to compromise and commit to a long-term plan to reduce the national debt. Republicans must budge on tax increases and Democrats must give ground on spending cuts, Greifeld said in a Monday speech at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think-tank. Without action from Congress, the dividend tax rate will rise to the ordinary income tax rates, as high as 39.6 percent for top earners. Dividends are now taxed at 15 percent for the top four brackets and zero at the bottom. In 2003, President George W. Bush and Congress cut taxes on capital gains and dividends, which mostly affect high-income taxpayers. These cuts are set to expire at the end of 2012. President Barack Obama proposed raising dividend taxes back to ordinary income tax rates in his most recent budget, but many Washington insiders believe Democrats will settle on a rate of 20 percent if a deal is struck. The Democratic-led Senate passed a bill this year extending the disputed Bush-era tax rates for the middle class and letting rates for the wealthiest taxpayers go up. But within that legislation, Senate Democrats proposed a 20 percent dividend tax rate - not Obama’s preferred higher rate. Add in the new investment tax from Obama’s health care law, and dividend taxes would rise to 23.8 percent. Dividend-paying companies including Altria Group Inc, AT&T; Inc and Verizon Communications Inc are among those pressing lawmakers to avoid a tax hike, with executives and surrogates making frequent visits to Capitol Hill. The family of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton owns roughly half the company’s shares and probably would pay much higher taxes on dividends paid after December 31 unless Congress takes action. Two of Sam Walton’s sons, Rob Walton and Jim Walton, are board members, and Chairman Rob Walton’s son-in-law, Gregory Penner, is also on the board. The Waltons and Penner recused themselves from the board discussion and vote on the dividend date change, Wal-Mart said. Rob Walton and Jim Walton are the 9th and 7th richest Americans, respectively, according to Forbes. Two other members of the Walton family are also listed in the top 10. Wal-Mart’s board approved changing the payment date of the quarterly dividend of 39.75 cents per share to December 27 from January 2. The record date associated with the payout remains December 7. Shares of Wal-Mart rose almost 1.5 percent to close at $69.02 on the New York Stock Exchange.

239,KO,Green Mountain appoints Coke executive as CEO,"(Reuters) - Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc GMCR.O appointed Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) executive Brian Kelley to its top post, betting on a products specialist to replace Lawrence Blanford who has led the company since 2007. Kelley’s appointment follows an almost eight-month CEO search after Blanford told the board in February he planned to retire. Shares of the maker of Keurig single-serve coffee brewers rose as much as 11 percent to $30.23 in early trading on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. Green Mountain investors will be looking at Kelley to turn around the business at a time when the company is facing increased competition from low-cost rivals after some of its patents expired and it is fending off questions about its business model and accounting practices. Kelley, 51, has been the chief product supply officer for Coca Cola Refreshments (CCR) — the unit that represents most of the company’s North American business — since October 2010, and was slated to take over as president of the unit next January. In an internal memo sent by CCR CEO Steve Cahillane to management on Monday, Glen Walter was named president. John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, said while Kelley was a talented executive whose departure is a loss for Coke, Walter would be a strong replacement. “Coke won’t miss a beat,” Sicher said. Green Mountain will pay Kelley an annual base salary of $900,000 and a signing bonus of $600,000, the company said in a regulatory filing. Under his employment agreement, Kelley is also eligible to earn annual cash bonus with a target of 100 percent of his annual base salary. Under Blanford’s reign, the company rose from a little-known Vermont-based coffee maker to one of the fastest-growing U.S. companies, following its 2006 acquisition of Keurig, a manufacturer of single-cup coffee machines. Green Mountain’s market value has increased five-fold since Blanford took the top job from founder Robert Stiller in 2007. But shares have fallen 41 percent this year.

It also reminds viewers that “all calories count no matter where they come from” and that “if you eat and drink more calories than you burn off, you’ll gain weight.” This is not the first time Coca-Cola has used advertising to address this issue, but it is a first for television. The move comes as New York City prepares for an upcoming ban on the sale of sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces (0.5 liter) in places like restaurants, movie theaters and stadiums. In November, voters in two California cities rejected ballot measures for soda taxes. The commercial will air on Monday on CNN’s “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,” FOX News’ “The O’Reilly Factor,” and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show.” It will air on Tuesday during other shows as well. “The audience for this new ad ... is knowledgeable about the problem but doesn’t necessarily know about what the Coca-Cola Co is doing to address it,” said Coke spokeswoman Diana Garza Ciarlante. “We are telling them our story.” Another commercial, which talks about Coke’s front-of-package calorie labels, will debut on Wednesday during the popular “American Idol” television show on Fox, which has partnered with Coke, the world’s largest soft drink maker, for some time. Ciarlante said the commercials were not in response to any increased pressure but Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest and an outspoken critic of the industry, said the move seems like “a full-blown exercise in damage control.” “They’re trying to pretend they’re part of the solution instead of part of the problem,” Jacobson said. If Coke was serious about wanting to be part of the solution, Jacobson said, it could stop advertising full-calorie drinks altogether, set up a pricing scheme where full-calorie drinks were more expensive, or stop opposing proposed soda taxes. In response Coca-Cola’s Stuart Kronauge, general manager of sparkling beverages for North America, said the obesity problem can only be solved with “honest and collective action.” “This includes action by business, government, teachers, scientists, health professionals, parents, and of course companies like the Coca-Cola Co,” Kronauge said in a statement. “We have an important role in this fight which can only be won if everyone works together.” Coca-Cola, which is also a big sponsor of the Olympics and other sporting events, spent about $610 million on advertising in 2011, according to Brad Adgate at Horizon Media Inc, citing figures from Advertising Age. American Idol is one of the costliest TV shows for advertisers, according to the latest annual survey by Advertising Age. The survey, released in October, found that the average cost of a 30-second spot on Wednesday’s edition of the show was $340,825.

254,KO,Coca-Cola kickstarts Arctic campaign with WWF donation,"LONDON (Reuters) - Coca-Cola will give 3 million euros ($4 million) to conservation group WWF over the next three years to help kickstart a campaign to protect the Arctic from the impacts of global warming, the world’s biggest soft-drinks maker said. The Europe-wide campaign, which launched on Thursday in London, is aimed at raising awareness and funding to help protect the natural habitat of the polar bear, which is under threat from climate change. Scientists say the Arctic is currently warming twice as fast as the global average and summer sea ice is disappearing at a rate of about 11 percent a decade. Ice thawed to a record low last year due to climate change. Most experts estimate the ice could disappear completely in summer in 30 to 40 years, though some scientists say it might thaw as soon as 2015. The shrinking ice mass threatens many Arctic ecosystems and species. The polar bear, a well-worn symbol of global warming’s effects on the region, is already feeling threatened. As ice retreats, polar bears are forced to spend more time on land hunting for food. As a result, people in some Arctic communities have encountered more bears which can be dangerous for the people and the bears. The campaign aims to raise awareness and funds in European countries for the plight of the polar bear. The money raised will go towards protecting an area in the Arctic where summer sea ice should last the longest, WWF and Coca-Cola said. That area covers 1.4 million km sq in northern Greenland and northern Canada - equivalent to a region bigger than both France and Spain. The money will also help WWF to study the polar bear population and habitat and help Arctic communities living close to an increasingly hungry polar bear population. Coca-Cola said it hopes the campaign will bring the Arctic into people’s homes. As well as a new TV commercial in Europe, the company is launching more than 300 million Coca-Cola packs and cans showing a polar bear family travelling across the Arctic. “Polar bears have been a much-loved part of our iconic Coca-Cola advertising for over 90 years and because of this strong tie, and our partnership with the WWF, we want to help create a future for polar bears and their Arctic home,” said Hilary Quinn, Coca-Cola’s Brand Director for North West Europe and the Nordics.

Grupo Yoli, which operates in the western states of Guerrero and Oaxaca, will get 42.4 million of newly-issued Coca-Cola FEMSA L Shares, each valued at 184 pesos. Additionally, Coca-Cola FEMSA will absorb 1 billion pesos in net debt. As part of the agreement, Coca-Cola FEMSA will also gain a 10.14 percent stake in Promotora Industrial Azucarera, boosting its holding in one of Mexico’s top sugar producers to 36.3 percent. The Yoli deal must still be approved by regulators and shareholders. The Mexican bottler has recently expanded its footprint in Mexico and abroad via acquisitions. In December, Coca-Cola FEMSA reached a deal to buy 51 percent in Coca-Cola Co’s Philippine bottling operations for $688.5 million in cash.

258,KO,Coca-Cola says did not intend Super Bowl ad to be derogatory,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co held what it called a “productive conversation” with an Arab-American group that labeled the firm’s Super Bowl ad racist, but will not change the commercial featuring an Arab walking through a desert with a camel. “We did express regret that the ad had been misunderstood,” Coca-Cola spokeswoman Lauren Thompson said in an email. “We are very concerned by these allegations and in no way is our ad meant to be derogatory to any group.” The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, which sharply criticized the commercial, said on Thursday it was pleased with the company’s apology and explanation, and believed the issue had been resolved. On Wednesday, the group had said it would ask Coca-Cola to change the spot before CBS airs the game this coming Sunday in front of an expected audience of more than 100 million U.S. viewers. Thompson said Coca Cola had not changed the ad, which was released online last week. It shows an Arab walking through a desert pulling a camel, as cowboys, Las Vegas show girls and a motley crew fashioned after the marauders of the apocalyptic “Mad Max” film, race by him to reach a gigantic bottle of Coke. The ad asks viewers to vote online on which characters should win the race. The online website does not allow a vote for the Arab character. The ADC and other groups cried foul over the image, and also the fact that it was not possible to vote for the Arab character. Warren David, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, said Coca-Cola had been “very apologetic.” “They ... said their intention was not to sustain the Arab stereotype,” he said. “We believe the issue is resolved and are now comfortable that Coke was in no way trying to demonize the Arab culture or race.” Abed Ayoub, director of legal and policy affairs for the group, said it now had a better understanding of Coca-Cola’s campaign, although he expected the ad would still rankle some. “I feel once the entire campaign comes through, then people will understand our position,” said Ayoub. Coca-Cola said the vote would run as planned. Imam Ali Siddiqui, president of the Muslim Institute for Interfaith Studies, said the ad was racist, “portraying Arabs as backward and foolish Camel Jockeys, and they have no chance to win in the world.” The Coca-Cola spokeswoman said Coke had taken a “cinematic” approach, employing the characters as a nod to movies of the past. “Coca-Cola is an inclusive brand enjoyed by all demographics,” she said. The 60-second video was the first commercial of Coca-Cola’s two-part Super Bowl advertising campaign. The spot will air during the game, followed by a different one in the post-Game telecast. Content for the campaign will also air online across Tumblr, Twitter and many other platforms. Coke will air two other unrelated Super Bowl commercials on Sunday, including one during the game and another during the pre-game portion of the telecast. The ADC garnered attention back in 1992 when it complained that lyrics in the Walt Disney animated film “Aladdin” were racist.

263,KO,Coca-Cola revenue misses Street view; shares drop,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co’s (KO.N) fourth-quarter revenue missed analysts’ estimates as lingering economic softness hurt results in Europe and China, sending its shares down 2.7 percent. The world’s largest soft drink maker, with brands such as Sprite, Fanta and Minute Maid, on Tuesday said worldwide sales volume climbed 3 percent, below some analysts’ estimates. Also disappointing were a 4 percent decline in China and a 5 percent drop in Europe, analysts said. “I think they’re diverse enough so that some things go up and some things go down and they manage OK,” said Bernstein Research analyst Ali Dibadj. “You certainly wish they were firing on all cylinders, but this environment doesn’t necessarily allow that to happen.” Revenue for the quarter rose 4 percent to $11.46 billion, missing analysts’ average estimate of $11.53 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In an interview, Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent said performance in China and Europe was not to his satisfaction, though he expects both regions to improve as 2013 unfolds. Still, he noted that the company’s overall performance was in line with its long-term goals, which call for growth of 3 percent to 4 percent for volume, 6 percent to 8 percent for operating earnings, and high single-digits for earnings per share. “In our opinion we haven’t missed any revenue targets. We said we would meet or exceed our long-term growth targets ... and we’ve met them, for the quarter and the year,” Kent said. He cited “prolonged uncertainty in Europe, the ongoing transition of the economy in China, the lukewarm recovery in the United States, and ongoing challenges for Japanese consumers.” He expects challenges in those markets to continue. Coke did have some bright spots, reporting volume growth of 10 percent in the Eurasia and Africa segment, 5 percent in Latin America, 1 percent in North America, and 2 percent in the Pacific region. The company also reported profit slightly above Wall Street estimates, fueled by better margins. Coca-Cola does not give quarterly financial forecasts but said that for the full year 2013 it expects $100 million in increased commodity costs related to sweeteners, juices, metals and plastic. It also forecast a one-time hit to earnings in the current quarter related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. As a result of that move, the foreign exchange impact on 2013 results may be slightly worse than previously expected, Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said. Coke is also seeing tougher competition from PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, which is working hard to improve its North American beverage business. Pepsi has increased marketing spending with a focus on core brands like Pepsi-Cola, and analysts say the renewed effort is working. “Unfortunately, given that volumes aren’t that robust, the success of one player certainly has a negative impact on the success of the other,” Bernstein’s Dibadj said. PepsiCo is due to report quarterly earnings on Thursday. Coke said fourth-quarter net income was $1.87 billion, or 41 cents per share, up from $1.66 billion, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring charges and other one-time items, earnings were 45 cents per share, topping analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Coca-Cola shares were down $1.03 at $37.58 in afternoon trading.

270,KO,Coca-Cola FEMSA eyes extremely low coupon for new bond,"Feb 13 (IFR) - Blue-chip credit Coca-Cola FEMSA (KOF) has always had ambitious pricing goals, but bankers are wondering whether it can really achieve its cheap target levels on a new international bond. The Latin American company, the largest Coca-Cola bottler in the world by sales, has been heard discussing a level of 80 basis points (bp) over Treasuries for a new 10-year issue. But while rates are super low at the moment, allowing companies to issue debt incredibly cheaply, pricing a bond less than 100bp over Treasuries might be too much to expect. Bankers say the price will ultimately be largely determined by how the company’s existing bonds are faring in the secondary market. Its outstanding 2020 bonds were priced in early 2010 at 60bp tighter than the Mexican government’s bonds - at the time one of the smallest coupons ever seen out of Latin America. The 4.625% printed at 99.491 to yield 4.689%, or 105bp over Treasuries. But that bond is now trading wide or flat to peers with lower credit ratings than KOF’s A2/A-/A, and has sold off since initial discussions began in December about a new debt issue. The spreads have climbed from a recent low of 119bp on October 18 to around 150bp this week on a G-spread basis, according to one banker. Because of this, many in the market say the goal of 80bp for the new issue may be just a little too bold - although 100bp seems well within reason. “At the end of the day, investors will price to the secondary (market),” one banker said. “Unless the 2020s rally to 65bp over, a new 10-year at 80bp will be ambitious.” KOF is roadshowing its new deal in the United States this week, according to one account, winding up on Thursday in Atlanta and Milwaukee. The company is believed to be considering a broad range of tenors from five to 30 years for the new deal, which is being led by Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. Pricing the deal inside of comparable US bonds, rather than any in Mexico, is thought to be the goal this time around. KOF last year bought a majority stake in Coca-Cola Bottling Philippines for about US$689m, making it a truly global player rather than simply a Mexican or Latin American name. By explaining its story in roadshows to investors, some say, KOF will be able to tighten the pricing on the new issue somewhat. “They could reposition this curve,” said a debt capital markets banker. “I could see them coming at 100bp.” At the current G-spread of around 150bp, the KOF 2020s compare to Dr. Pepper’s 2022s (Baa1/BBB), which are being quoted at around 92bp; Heineken’s 2023s (Baa1), quoted at 110bp; and InBev’s 2023s at 84bp over Treasuries. Meanwhile KOF’s parent Coca-Cola has 2021s trading at a G-spread of 66bp. In its favor for reaching the ambitious pricing target, KOF has its underlying credit strength, the illiquidity of the existing bonds and the relatively high price of the 2020s. All of these factors could be leveraged to encourage investors to participate, if KOF indeed does decide to raise the  full US$1bn-US$1.25bn it is heard seeking and establish a liquid benchmark. But at approximately 111 dollars, the price on the KOF 2020s is not that high - and being able to come 70bp inside the current 150bp G-spread seems unlikely. With the 10-year US Treasuries at around 1.975% on Tuesday, an 80bp finish would equate to a yield of 2.775% - an incredibly cheap price for any new KOF debt. Some bankers say that the secondary levels on the existing 2020s don’t reflect KOF’s underlying credit quality. But, as one put it, the secondary pricing is real - and there for a reason. “You don’t get 70bp of arbitrage in single A names,” the banker said. “The Street would keep putting in higher and higher prices until they got paper.” Timing for any deal remains unclear. Bankers are wondering whether KOF will wait for the release of its fourth-quarter earnings before moving forward with what is expected to be an SEC-registered bond. There has also been talk that the borrower might want to meet with Asian investors, given its recent acquisition in the Philippines.

273,KO,Analysis: Health-conscious Americans hurt aluminum can market,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. aluminum can sales are set to slow in 2013 for a third straight year as more consumers ditch sodas for healthier options such as water and iced teas, traditionally bottled in plastic or glass. The loss of market share in the fizzy drinks capital of the world, also due to loud anti-obesity campaigns such as those promoted by Walt Disney and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, has forced producers of sheet aluminum for cans, as well as can fabricators, to seek new, more profitable markets abroad. Novelis Inc, the world’s largest flat-rolled aluminum maker, and can producer Ball Corp have both invested in Asia and in Brazil, where they expect to see can sales spike as the 2014 football World Cup and 2016 Olympics approach. Alcoa, the top U.S. aluminum producer, and Novelis, which produces can sheet for manufacturers of drinks such as Coca Cola, expect can demand to contract as much as 1 percent in North America in 2013. “This is mainly driven by a more health-conscious public, (which) is consuming more drinks perceived as healthier,” Novelis’ global director of strategy for can, Michael Demmer, said in a phone interview. “This trend will likely continue but the soda producers will try to contrast that by producing healthier drinks.” Even so, the United States is a massive soda can market by any comparison. Some 5 percent of global annual aluminum consumption - 1.7 million metric metric tons - is for making U.S. and Canadian cans each year. The average American drinks about 160 liters of soda a year, the equivalent of a bath tub-full, two-thirds more than in the United Kingdom and far in excess of the emerging economies China and India, where the average annual consumption is less than 5 liters. To defend this large market, the soda industry is taking steps to block Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s ban on large sugary drinks in New York City, due to be implemented in June. The United States faces an obesity epidemic. Campaigns aimed at curbing consumption of high-calorie foods and drinks have multiplied, ranging from voluntary industry action to government and policy steps. Disney plans to limit junk food advertising on shows aired on the media and entertainment giant’s television channel geared toward children while many school districts across the U.S. have banned sugary drinks from vending machines and cafeterias in schools. Compared to 2006, half as many adolescents can now buy high-calorie sodas in schools but much more needs to be done according to anti-obesity advocates. Soda consumption in the United States has been shrinking since 2006, dwindling to a 16-year low last year. That contrasts with growing consumption elsewhere. Can use is increasing at double-digit percentage rates in some emerging countries and is growing even in debt-burdened Europe. Alcoa expects can demand in Europe to grow by 2 percent to 3 percent this year and China to post an 8 percent to 12 percent increase. Ball ceased production at two of its U.S. beverage packaging plants last year while it invested in can plants it Vietnam, China, Brazil and Italy. [ID:nL4E8JF6KE] Novelis is expanding in South Korea and Brazil, primarily due to the growth it sees in can consumption in those regions. “Shipping costs are high so it makes more sense to open lines in the countries where you can sell cans locally,” said Metal Bulletin Research aluminum analyst Kamil Wlazly. With anti-soda initiatives likely to support or even accelerate the fall of fizzy-drink consumption in North America, aluminum companies are trying to produce more specialty containers and promote them as an attractive package for healthier and alcoholic drinks too. “In the last couple of years we have seen the emergence of cans as a package for fruit juices, iced teas and in new categories such as ready-mixed cocktails,” said Benjamin Punchard, senior global packaging analyst at Mintel. Punchard said can producers are also innovating with new sizes and shapes, resealable containers, surface designs and chromatic effects such as matt finishes. Some of these developments, coupled with the promotion of aluminum cans as being more recyclable than glass and plastic bottles, have pushed some craft breweries to switch to aluminum. Shipments of alcoholic beverage can grew by more than 2 percent in 2012 in the United States, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute, an industry trade group. “Breweries are using more aluminum containers as a look or marketing choice as well as for sustainability reasons,” Demmer said. Beer maker Coors Light, for example, is promoting its ‘Silver Bullet’ aluminum cans and bottles for their “coldness” in a series of TV advertisements. Can manufacturers hope this trend will offset the decline of soda cans and shield their profits in the Unites States, at least in the medium term.

278,KO,Chok! Chok! Chok! ad shakes up mobile marketing,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - A strange phenomenon hit Hong Kong in late 2011. As the clock hit 10 pm each night a Coca Cola ad aired on television, prompting thousands of viewers to grab their phones and start shaking them frantically to virtually “catch” the falling bottle caps on the screen and win instant prizes. Dubbed Chok! Chok! Chok! - meaning rapid motion in local slang - the interactive campaign by McCann Worldgroup became a hit, and sent viewers at home, in cinemas and in front of giant outdoor screens into a frenzy. (link.reuters.com/wux36t) Nine million people saw the ad - 380,000 downloaded the Chok! Chok! Chok! app in the first month - and its success indicates that marketers may be finally figuring out how to direct ads at consumers via mobile phones. “The consumer is there so we as marketers start to salivate,” said Mike Parker, chief digital officer for McCann, in an interview at the Mobile World Congress. “But people are so underwhelmed by banner ads on tiny screens. We are all still searching for the best way forward.” Mobile advertising is set to grow by more than 50 percent a year over the period to hit $40 billion in 2016, according to Informa research, but the figures are still tiny compared to television ads. Global ad spend in 2012 was $500 billion. Though advertisers are keen to harness the mobile boom, no one has perfected the art of using mobile devices to target adverts to consumers. There remains a vast discrepancy between the amount of time consumers spend on their mobile devices and the advertising dollars companies spend there. In the U.S., mobile ads only accounted for 1 percent of marketing spend in 2011, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau, even though people spent some 10 percent of their media time looking at their phones. Mobile has long proved almost impenetrable for a host of reasons, including the small screen, poor presentation of mobile websites and consumers’ resistance to the invasion of a space seen as more private than a computer. Even Google, which dominates online search, is still grappling with how to make money from ads on smartphones, while Facebook is trying to weave marketing messages into people’s newsfeeds without offending them. With many brands still wary of annoying consumers with lots of tiny ads or repetitive text messages, some like Coca Cola hit upon the idea of rewarding mobile owners with coupons, prizes or free content as a way to make a connection. Helping them make that link is Brian Wong, chief executive of San Francisco-based kiip, a mobile app rewards network that connects brands and companies with consumers. He says his startup has found a winning formula - and that people have contacted him to say thank you for the adverts. “The rewards are a pleasant surprise for the user. It’s like a gift that comes out of the blue,” Wong said. In one campaign run via kiip by Pepsi, a person logging their morning 5 kilometer jog on a fitness app like MapMyRun sees a grey band pop up on the top of their smartphone screen. If they click on it, a window appears: “What a workout! Refresh yourself with a bottle of Propel Zero” and they are emailed a coupon for the fitness drink to redeem at a local store. Targeting such “moments of achievement”, such as when a gamer passes a level or a cyclist beats his personal best, allows marketers to target people at opportune moments in ways that are relevant to them, Wong says. Kiip only gets paid if the customer redeems the reward and as a result brands are willing to pay more for a system based on results. Although Wong won’t say how much kiip charges, it is likely more than the average price for mobile ads, which in turn are cheaper than ads on PCs. A perception that banner ads on small screens are not very effective and the glut of available space has kept prices capped at around $1 per thousand views. For mobile ads to become more effective - and lucrative - marketers have to get more creative at tapping mobile’s advantages, such as the direct link to a person all day and the location data. The industry is also working on coming up with better metrics to measure effectiveness of mobile ads, which could one day boost their value. One way to improve the effectiveness of mobile marketing is to link up a person’s web browsing history on computers with their smartphone. Mark Strecker, the chief operating officer of mobile advertising technology company Amobee, said companies were in the early stages of such work. For example, when a shopper walks into a retailer like the Gap, their phone would know they had earlier looked at jeans on the store’s website from their home computer and send them details about availability of their size. The additional information about users also means agencies now make fewer mistakes. “If we see, from the location, that someone has gone to a car showroom then we could send them car ads,” said Dani Cushion, executive at mobile ad platform Millennial Media. “But if we see they go to the showroom every day, then they probably just work there.” ",2282013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mobile-world-advertising/chok-chok-chok-ad-shakes-up-mobile-marketing-idUSBRE91R13I20130228
279,KO,Greek Coke bottler gets UK approval for share swap plan,"ATHENS, March 8 (Reuters) - A voluntary share exchange offer that will allow Greek Coke bottler Coca-Cola Hellenic (CCH)  to move from Greece to Switzerland and list on the London Stock Exchange has been approved by the British authorities. CCH said last year it would move its base from cash-strapped Greece to tax-free Switzerland and switch its premier listing from Athens to London. A voluntary share swap offer by Swiss holding company Coca-Cola HBC AG. would facilitate the procedure. “This is a significant milestone in the process to enable the company to list on the London Stock Exchange,” a CCH official who declined to be named said on Friday. For the offer to begin, CCH still needs the approval of Greece’s Capital Market Commision and the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission. The official said the process was at an advanced stage. In the prospectus for its listing on the London Stock Exchange published late on Thursday, CCH said the offer was expected to start later this month and end in April. “The commencement of the acceptance period is expected on or around 19 March 2013 and is expected to expire on or around 19 April 2013,” CCH said. The firm, in which The Coca-Cola Co of the United States has a 23-percent stake, bottles Coke and other produce in 28 countries from Russia to Nigeria.

282,KO,Coca-Cola to return some distribution to U.S. franchisers,"(Reuters) - Less than three years after spending billions of dollars to acquire most of its U.S. distribution operations, Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) is starting to sell it off again. Getting out of the capital-intensive, low-return business of delivering bottles and cans of soda to stores, restaurants and vending machines will improve margins. That, and a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, sent shares of the world’s largest soft-drink maker up nearly 6 percent. Coke and PepsiCo Inc PEP.N both acquired their North American bottling operations in 2010, in moves aimed at cutting costs, speeding innovation and turning around a sagging market where increasingly health-conscious consumers drink less soda. Coke said on Tuesday it would return more quickly than expected toward a franchise model in the United States, where independent companies will deliver the drinks to local stores. Unlike in the past, Coke plans to continue producing the drinks. “This is a different model than elsewhere in the world, but we see this as the right time to go forward with these bottling partners,” Steve Cahillane, president of Coca-Cola Americas, said in an interview. The five bottlers expected to expand their territories in upcoming transactions with Coke are Coca-Cola Bottling Co Consolidated (COKE.O), Coca-Cola Bottling Co United Inc, Swire Coca-Cola USA, Coca-Cola Bottling Co High Country and Corinth Coca-Cola Bottling Works Inc. Depending on the situations, the deals might include an outright territory sale, a territory swap or a sub-bottling arrangement by which the bottler would make ongoing payments to Coke in exchange for operating rights. The agreements are subject to the parties reaching definitive deals by the end of 2013, with closings expected in 2014. Financial terms were not disclosed. Neither was Coke’s intended use of the proceeds. “It’s an evolution,” CEO Muhtar Kent told Reuters. Kent has consistently said he still believed in the franchise model, suggesting that Coke would return to it. Coke had generally laid out a timeline of three to five years. In the quarters since the $12.3 billion acquisition, Coke has improved performance in North America. Coca-Cola, whose brands range from Diet Coke to Minute Maid to vitaminwater, often restructures its distribution in markets around the world. For example, it recently sold half its Philippines bottler to Coca-Cola Femsa (KOFL.MX). As for the first quarter, it said net income was $1.75 billion, or 39 cents per share, down from $2.05 billion, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings were hurt by a calendar shift that stripped the quarter of two selling days. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 46 cents per share, topping analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

287,KO,Price increases help PepsiCo profit beat expectations,"(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc PEP.N posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday, as price increases helped margins, sending its shares up 4 percent. The maker of Pepsi-Cola, Tropicana juice and Frito-Lay snacks kept its full-year forecast unchanged, however, saying it may reinvest in its business and adjust pricing moving forward. Still, the strong results are a validation of the turnaround strategy of Indra Nooyi, who led the company through a “transition year” in 2012, during which it sacrificed profits to invest in marketing and innovation. “The business momentum continues to look solid, as PepsiCo delivered its first earnings growth quarter in over a year,” JP Morgan analyst John Faucher said, noting that the company’s stock had been weaker than its peers in the past few days. Despite the better-than-expected first quarter, Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston told analysts not to increase their 2013 estimates, citing a “volatile world” and a higher tax rate moving forward. In addition, soda prices may not stay as high as they were in the first quarter. PepsiCo, based in Purchase, New York, decided to raise prices on some of its drinks more than its rivals during the quarter, a move that predictably boosted profits but hurt sales. The Americas drink business saw operating profit rise 8 percent while revenue fell 1 percent. “We look very carefully at this trade-off between volume, pricing and profit,” Nooyi said. “As we go forward, expect us to continue to play a responsible game in North American beverages, to be competitive, of course, to also enhance our performance.” The company will not let its volume decline for the balance of the year be as big as it was in the first quarter, she said. For PepsiCo overall, sales volume rose 4 percent for snacks and 3 percent for beverages. In the Americas, volume rose 3 percent in foods and fell 3 percent in beverages. Net income was $1.08 billion, or 69 cents per share in the first quarter, down from $1.13 billion, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a hit from the Venezuelan currency devaluation, restructuring charges and other items, earnings were 77 cents per share, a 12 percent increase from a year earlier. On that basis, analysts on average were expecting 71 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose about 1 percent to $12.58 billion. Excluding the impacts from currency translation and refranchising its business in China, revenue grew 4 percent. PepsiCo increased its advertising and marketing spending by 11 percent in the first quarter. For the full year, it expects that spending rise at or above the rate of revenue growth, forecast at a mid-single-digit rate. Earlier this week, Coke reported a slightly better-than-expected profit and said it was taking steps to refranchise its U.S. distribution system, less than three years after acquiring the bulk of it in a $12.3 billion deal. Coke’s 2010 acquisition followed a similar move by PepsiCo, which said on Thursday that it was exploring structural alternatives, but would not discuss it until early next year. For the full year PepsiCo said it still expects 2013 earnings to grow 7 percent from the $4.10 per share it earned in 2012. Its shares rose $3.37, or 4 percent to $82.27 on the New York Stock Exchange.

288,KO,UPDATE 4-Mexico's Coca-Cola Femsa shares sink on lower 1st-qtr profit,"* 1st-qtr profit 2.434 bln pesos vs 2.637 bln a year ago * Costs rise 5.3 pct * Parent Femsa reports higher earnings By Elinor Comlay April 24 (Reuters) - Mexico’s Coca-Cola Femsa, Latin America’s biggest Coke bottler, said higher costs triggered a 7.7 percent drop in its first-quarter profit, sending its shares down more than 7 percent in morning trading. The company, a joint venture of Coca-Cola Co and Mexican firm Femsa , reported on Wednesday that profit dropped to 2.434 billion pesos ($197 million) from 2.637 billion pesos a year earlier. Higher freight and labor costs in some countries as well as increased marketing investment in South America dragged on earnings, the company said. Coca-Cola Femsa shares fell as much as 7.1 percent to 204 pesos in morning trading, falling back from a record high close in the previous session. Mexico’s IPC stock index was down more than 1 percent. The volume of bottled drinks sold increased 3.9 percent in the quarter but total revenue edged up less than 1 percent to 33.68 billion pesos, hurt by the strengthening of Mexico’s peso against other regional currencies in the quarter. Still, the results did not dampen the company’s expectations for the year. “We are confident that our operators’ skills, coupled with a benign commodity cost environment, will enable us to achieve our targets for the full year,” said Chief Executive Carlos Salazar in a statement. Coca-Cola Femsa has been on a buying spree in the last two years, snapping up smaller, family-owned Coke bottlers in Mexico, and it also made its first foray outside of Latin America when it bought a stake in Coca-Cola Co’s bottling operations in the  Philippines. The Monterrey-based company could also consider acquiring some of Coca Cola Co’s operations in the United States, Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino told analysts on a conference call. Right now the company is focused on opportunities in Latin America as well as working on its business plan in the Philippines. However, Trevino added: “We (would) certainly analyze and take a hard look at the (US).” Coke said last week it plans to refranchise some of its capital-intensive U.S. distribution business. Separately, Femsa, which also operates the Oxxo chain of convenience stores, reported its first-quarter profit increased more than 12 percent. Femsa also holds a 20 percent stake in Heineken, after selling its beer-making business to the Dutch company in 2010. Oxxo stores, which primarily sell Coke products and Heineken beers, have expanded rapidly and the company told investors in February it is considering repeating its formula with fast food and drugstores. Femsa shares were down 4.9 percent at 143.51 in early afternoon trading. The company said separately that due to low rates globally, it is considering issuing more long-term debt. Femsa had net debt of 6.12 billion pesos at the end of March.

CCHBC  buys syrup concentrate from The Coca-Cola Company and bottles and distributes the U.S. group’s drinks in 28 countries from Russia to Nigeria. The first quarter traditionally accounts for a small part of full-year earnings. Sales volume was 426.7 million unit cases in the first quarter, matching analysts’ average forecast of 426 million cases. Government spending cuts and high unemployment in Greece and Italy, CCHBC’s second-biggest market, are hitting demand for soft drinks, eclipsing robust growth in Russia, the bottler’s biggest market. However, cost savings helped CCHBC’s bottom line. The company narrowed its loss to 15.9 million euros ($20.45 million) from 19 million euros in the same period last year. The reported loss excludes restructuring and other one-off items. CCHBC has been cutting costs and adapting prices to boost profit. The bottler said it will continue this policy to deal with tough conditions for the remainder of the year. Its board proposed a 2012 dividend of 0.34 euros per share. CCHBC moved its headquarters to Switzerland from debt-laden Greece last month and its primary listing to London to save on taxes and improve access to capital markets.

Some 50 workers protesting for higher wages soldered shut the gates of the company’s largest plant in the central-western city of Valencia, preventing products and personnel from entering or leaving the compound, the company said. “During the course of the strike, 15 percent of our sales at a national level have already been lost, what has not been sold will not be recovered,” Mariana Parma, director of corporate affairs at Coca-Cola Femsa Venezuela said, describing worker demands as “crazy.” The company calls the strike “illegal” and “arbitrary” and said some parts of the country are already facing shortages of its products including Coca-Cola, bottled water and juice.

302,KO,Coke to sell 'natural' mid-calorie cola in Argentina,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) announced plans on Wednesday to introduce a cola that is sweetened with sugar and the naturally occurring, no-calorie sweetener stevia, the latest move in the high-stakes race to turn around the soda industry. Coca-Cola Life will have about half the calories of regular Coke. It will go on sale this week in Argentina, where Coca-Cola has 50 percent of the soda market, compared with PepsiCo Inc’s PEP.N 16 percent, according to industry newsletter Beverage Digest, which was first to report the news. The world’s largest soda company has used stevia in 45 products, such as Vitaminwater Zero and Fanta Select, but never in its flagship cola. There is no date for introducing the product elsewhere. Company executives at a news conference in Buenos Aires likened the launch with the 2005 debut of Coca-Cola Zero, which was first introduced in Australia and later sold elsewhere. Consumer Edge Research analyst Bill Pecoriello said a global roll out seemed likely because it would also preempt PepsiCo’s sweetener innovation. “A healthy dose of skepticism as to the long-term success potential is warranted, given past introductions,” he added. There has been a recent wave of mid-calorie sodas such as Pepsi Next and Dr Pepper 10, but they have not maintained market share, Pecoriello said. Coke and Pepsi have been using stevia, a plant native to Paraguay, in drinks for years, but mostly in noncarbonated, fruit-flavored drinks. As recently as last month, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi said stevia did not work well in colas, even though Pepsi Next in Australia uses stevia. Pepsi Next in other markets, including the United States, uses a mix of high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners. Nooyi told a conference hosted by Bernstein Research in May that a breakthrough in sweetener technology could help reverse the decline in sodas in the United States and that it needed to occur sooner rather than later. “If you let this go too long, another three or five years, the consumer will walk away from (carbonated soft drinks),” she said at the conference. “But if we can address the barriers to consumption, we can actually bring back the lapsed users.” Regarding its own innovation, PepsiCo said in February that preparation was underway for the review and commercialization of a new “beverage innovation project,” but it had not yet been submitted to U.S. regulators for review. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman said PepsiCo was “working to identify sweetener and flavor options that can help us provide more reduced or zero-calorie beverage choices.” Coca-Cola shares closed up 1.5 percent at $40.33 on the New York Stock Exchange. PepsiCo stock was up 1.6 percent at $81.30, while Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc DPS.N rose 1.5 percent to end the day at $45.64.

Andina’s  and Ipiranga’s board of directors have approved the transaction, which is expected to be completed during the second half of 2013, the Chilean company said in a statement. The deal “highlights our commitment to the Brazilian market, as we see it as a region of immense growth potential with a valuable consumer market that will further fuel our operations,” Andina chief executive Miguel Angel Peirano said. Ipiranga, with operations in Brazil’s Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states, had 2012 volume sales of 89.3 million unit cases and revenues of 695 million reais, or $356 million. Andina said that the transaction, which it expects to finance with debt, would allow it to “capture operative and logistics synergies for approximately 10 million reais per year, as well as tax efficiencies.” Andina already has operations in parts of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, as well as all of Paraguay.

310,KO,"Coke sales disappoint on wet weather, weak economy","(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported disappointing second quarter sales on Tuesday as global economic weakness and cool, wet weather crimped demand for soft drinks. The world’s largest soda maker said sales volume rose 1 percent, which was below its expectations. It cited economic slowdowns in Europe and Asia, a consumer credit crunch in Brazil and inflation in Mexico. It also said a historically wet and cold spring in the United States, very early monsoons in India, and flooding in central Europe curbed sales and overall consumer spending. Coke Chief Executive Muhtar Kent described the disappointing performance as an anomaly and a “confluence of events” that should not continue to occur together. He said performance would improve in the second half of 2013, even though foreign exchange rates are expected to hurt earnings by 4 percent, or double its previous estimate. The summer weather is now more comparable with the previous year and performance should improve in Latin America, where social unrest in Brazil interrupted sales. Coke also expects sales in China, where volume was flat, to improve because of several factors including a new management team, new packages and expanded distribution to third-tier cities. Coke doesn’t give quarterly forecasts, but Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said 2013 should see growth very close to the company’s long-term targets, and what was expected at the start of the year. Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj questioned whether weak economies and weather were temporary issues, or if they represent another secular challenge for an industry already beset by increasing health consciousness and intensifying competition. “That’s not known yet,” Dibadj said. He added that Coke has, of late, been driving more of its earnings through non-operating levers like tax and interest expense, while investors are looking for more operating improvements. Coca-Cola shares, which had gained about 5 percent in recent weeks, were down 1.4 percent at $40.42 in afternoon trade. “I’d use today as a buying opportunity to add to our position,” said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management. “We still believe in the long-term story and think it will bounce back toward the second half of the year.” Still, if forced to choose, Bradshaw said he would opt for PepsiCo Inc PEP.N shares moving forward, since that stock has gained nearly 24 percent this year, versus only 13 percent for Coke. Furthermore, PepsiCo should get a bigger boost from lower corn prices, given its Frito-Lay division. PepsiCo plans to report second-quarter results on July 24. In the second quarter, ended on June 28, Coke’s net income dipped to $2.68 billion, or 59 cents per share, from $2.79 billion, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items such as restructuring charges and tax matters, earnings were 63 cents per share, in line with the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue dropped 3 percent to $12.75 billion, missing expectations of $12.96 billion. Foreign exchange rates hurt revenue by 2 percent. By region, sales volume fell 1 percent in North America and 4 percent in Europe, but rose 2 percent in Latin America, 9 percent in Eurasia and Africa, and 2 percent in the Pacific region. JP Morgan analyst John Faucher said volume results were below his expectations in all regions except North America.

311,KO,S&P; retreats after eight days of gains as Coca-Cola drags,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 snapped its eight-day winning streak on Tuesday after disappointing sales from Coca-Cola, while investors turned cautious on the day before the Federal Reserve chairman’s congressional testimony. The market’s pullback came a day after both the Dow and the S&P; 500 ended at record closing highs for the third consecutive session. Tuesday’s volume was below average at 5.5 billion shares traded on exchanges, but above Monday’s 4.91 billion, which was the lightest of any full trading day this year. Eight of the 10 S&P; 500 industry sector indexes declined, with materials shares among the day’s worst performers. Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) was the biggest drag in terms of points on the S&P; 500 after the world’s largest soft drinks maker reported weaker-than-expected second-quarter sales, which it blamed on economic malaise and unusually cold and wet weather. The stock, which was the Dow’s biggest percentage loser, fell 1.9 percent to $40.23. “I think you’re going to see a lot of companies that are coming in just barely meeting their earnings expectations and again reporting reduced revenues, and I think that’s the crux of the problem with our economy,” said Brian Amidei, managing director at HighTower Advisors in Palm Desert, California. Investors are eager to hear Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s testimony about monetary policy on Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. His comments will be closely analyzed for signs of when the central bank may start reducing its stimulus efforts. Bernanke’s comments in late May, which raised the prospect of trimming the Fed’s $85 billion in monthly stimulus, triggered a brief selloff and interrupted this year’s rally. The S&P; 500 is still up 17.5 percent since December 31. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI slipped 32.41 points, or 0.21 percent, to end at 15,451.85.

The day’s economic data showed that U.S. consumer prices picked up in June. The overall U.S. Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent, the largest gain since February, after inching up 0.1 percent in May. U.S. homebuilder confidence rose in July to its strongest level in 7-1/2 years. Financial stocks, which started the day as outperformers, also dropped despite strong earnings from Goldman Sachs (GS.N). The S&P; financial sector index .SPSY fell 0.4 percent. Goldman Sachs reported quarterly profit doubled as the bank made more money trading bonds before an interest-rate spike hit markets in June. But Goldman’s stock slid 1.7 percent to $160.24 as investors fretted that the results could not be easily repeated. In other earnings reports, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) shares were flat at $90.40 after the Dow component reported higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Strong sales of prescription drugs and medical devices more than offset anemic growth of its consumer products, Johnson & Johnson said.

The market’s pullback came a day after both the Dow and the S&P; 500 ended at record closing highs for the third consecutive session. Tuesday’s decline put the S&P; 500 on track to break an eight-day string of gains.

315,KO,"UPDATE 4-Coke sales disappoint on wet weather, weak economy","By Martinne Geller July 16 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co reported disappointing second quarter sales on Tuesday as global economic weakness and cool, wet weather crimped demand for soft drinks. The world’s largest soda maker said sales volume rose 1 percent, which was below its expectations. It cited economic slowdowns in Europe and Asia, a consumer credit crunch in Brazil and inflation in Mexico. It also said a historically wet and cold spring in the United States, very early monsoons in India, and flooding in central Europe curbed sales and overall consumer spending. Coke Chief Executive Muhtar Kent described the disappointing performance as an anomaly and a “confluence of events” that should not continue to occur together. He said performance would improve in the second half of 2013, even though foreign exchange rates are expected to hurt earnings by 4 percent, or double its previous estimate. The summer weather is now more comparable with the previous year and performance should improve in Latin America, where social unrest in Brazil interrupted sales. Coke also expects sales in China, where volume was flat, to improve because of several factors including a new management team, new packages and expanded distribution to third-tier cities. Coke doesn’t give quarterly forecasts, but Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said 2013 should see growth very close to the company’s long-term targets, and what was expected at the start of the year. Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj questioned whether weak economies and weather were temporary issues, or if they represent another secular challenge for an industry already beset by increasing health consciousness and intensifying competition. “That’s not known yet,” Dibadj said. He added that Coke has, of late, been driving more of its earnings through non-operating levers like tax and interest expense, while investors are looking for more operating improvements. Coca-Cola shares, which had gained about 5 percent in recent weeks, were down 1.4 percent at $40.42 in afternoon trade. “I’d use today as a buying opportunity to add to our position,” said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management. “We still believe in the long-term story and think it will bounce back toward the second half of the year.” Still, if forced to choose, Bradshaw said he would opt for PepsiCo Inc shares moving forward, since that stock has gained nearly 24 percent this year, versus only 13 percent for Coke. Furthermore, PepsiCo should get a bigger boost from lower corn prices, given its Frito-Lay division. PepsiCo plans to report second-quarter results on July 24. In the second quarter, ended on June 28, Coke’s net income dipped to $2.68 billion, or 59 cents per share, from $2.79 billion, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items such as restructuring charges and tax matters, earnings were 63 cents per share, in line with the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue dropped 3 percent to $12.75 billion, missing expectations of $12.96 billion. Foreign exchange rates hurt revenue by 2 percent. By region, sales volume fell 1 percent in North America and 4 percent in Europe, but rose 2 percent in Latin America, 9 percent in Eurasia and Africa, and 2 percent in the Pacific region. JP Morgan analyst John Faucher said volume results were below his expectations in all regions except North America.",7162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/cocacola-results/update-4-coke-sales-disappoint-on-wet-weather-weak-economy-idUSL1N0FM0BE20130716
316,KO,"GLOBAL MARKETS-Shares, dollar slip day before Bernanke testimony","* European shares close down after ZEW sentiment index dips * U.S. dollar index down but holds above last week’s lows * U.S. Treasuries flat ahead of Bernanke testimony * Brent crude oil hits 3-month high before turning lower By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, July 16 (Reuters) - The dollar fell and U.S. stocks edged lower on Tuesday, snapping an eight-day advance by the benchmark S&P; 500 index, as investors took a cautious stance before the Federal Reserve chief’s testimony to a congressional panel on Wednesday. Analysts expect Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke to reiterate previous remarks that U.S. monetary policy will remain accommodative. But investors will look for clues as to when the U.S. central bank might start reducing its economic stimulus. The dollar’s losses against the euro were limited after data showing an unexpected fall in German investor sentiment in July and subdued euro zone inflation added to expectations the European Central Bank also will keep rates low to aid the region’s recovery. U.S. stocks fell, in tandem with a sharper decline in European stock markets. The euro rose 0.61 percent to $1.3142, recovering from $1.3057 struck after the German ZEW survey of investor sentiment survey. Against the yen, the dollar lost 0.56 percent to 99.29. The dollar fell late last week after Bernanke said highly accommodative monetary policy would be needed for the foreseeable future. Bernanke’s remarks on the economy and monetary policy will be released at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) on Wednesday. “Bernanke will be a dove in his testimony and it will continue to surprise me that it is actually not fully priced in,” said Sebastien Galy, foreign exchange strategist at Societe Generale in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 39.09 points or 0.25 percent, to 15,445.17, the S&P; 500 lost 7.14 points or 0.42 percent, to 1,675.36 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 10.86 points or 0.3 percent, to 3,596.63. Shares of Coca-Cola Co fell after it reported second-quarter sales were weaker than expected as global economic weakness and cool weather crimped the consumption of soft drinks. The Dow component’s shares fell 1.5 percent to $40.41. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 0.73 percent at a provisional 1,191.15 points, while a measure of global equity markets, MSCI’s all-country world index , fell 0.03 percent. U.S. Treasuries traded near break-even before Bernanke’s testimony. He is expected to stress the Fed will hold rates low for a long time. Benchmark 10-year Treasuries yields have fallen from two-year highs of 2.76 percent on July 8 as officials have tried to soothe concerns over the pace at which the Fed will begin to phase out its unprecedented quantitative easing stimulus measures. The 10-year T-bill was up 1/32 to yield 2.5392 percent. Tom Tucci, head of Treasuries trading at CIBC in New York, said the central banks would like to stop their bond-buying to help the economy. “The way they are going to get out of it is by giving forward guidance that they are going to be extremely easy in the front end for a long period of time, which will anchor rates lower overall,” Tucci said. U.S. consumer prices accelerated in June, but underlying inflation pressures showed signs of stabilizing, keeping on track expectations the Federal Reserve will start tapering its bond purchases later this year. Other data on Tuesday showed industrial production pushed higher in June, raising hope a recent slowdown in factory activity was either over or close to running its course. Crude prices traded near break-even. Brent crude was up 6 cents at $109.15 a barrel. U.S. oil was down 20 cents to $106.12.

317,KO,"Coke likely to face Vitaminwater class-action, but not for money","(Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge has recommended that Coca-Cola Co face a class-action lawsuit accusing it of misleading consumers by overstating the health benefits of its Vitaminwater drink. In a decision made public on Thursday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Levy in Brooklyn, New York nonetheless said consumers could not sue as a group for money damages, a “central” part of their case, but rather to try to change how Coca-Cola labels and markets the product. Plaintiffs in the 4-1/2-year-old lawsuit included California and New York residents, with support from the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a health advocacy group. The group accused Coca-Cola of deceptively marketing Vitaminwater as an alternative to water and sugared soft drinks that could promote healthy joints, boost the immune system and help people fight eye disease, among other health benefits. Levy said the plaintiffs had standing to sue by claiming they were misled into believing that Vitaminwater was healthier than it really was, or that other beverages would have been. But he said that while monetary relief was “central to their claims,” and that damages per individual were likely small, the consumers could not sue as a group to obtain it because of the variations in how much each individual paid or was owed. Plaintiffs “have not presented a class-wide damages model that can be used based on common proof, or a reliable method of distributing damages to putative class members,” he wrote. The case now goes to U.S. District Judge Dora Irizarry for approval. Federal district judges typically accept magistrate judges’ recommendations. Both sides welcomed parts of the decision.

319,KO,UPDATE 1-Mexico's Coke Femsa reports higher second-quarter profit,"MEXICO CITY, July 24 (Reuters) - Mexican Coke bottler Coca-Cola Femsa on Wednesday said second-quarter profit rose about 3.5 percent, as lower sales costs and sugar prices offset a slight drop in revenue caused by currency weakness outside of Mexico. The company reported a profit of 2.807 billion pesos ($216 million), up from 2.713 billion pesos in the year-earlier period. Revenue fell slightly to 36.26 billion pesos from 36.30 billion pesos in the April-June period in 2012. Coke Femsa said revenue was dampened as currencies in Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia weakened against the Mexican peso in the quarter. Sales volume increased 3.5 percent from the year-earlier quarter helped by a jump in still beverage sales including Coke Femsa’s juice business, Jugos del Valle, as well as its sports drink Powerade and Fuze tea.

321,KO,Exclusive: DOJ starts probe into Wall St. metals warehousing - sources,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has started a preliminary probe into the metals warehousing industry following complaints that storage firms owned by Wall Street banks and major traders have inflated prices, sources familiar with the matter said. The DOJ has sent letters to at least two companies that own warehouses seeking more information about practices that industrial users allege have led to supply shortages and billions of dollars in extra costs, two sources familiar with the letter said on Wednesday. A third source said the DOJ had informed at least one metal consumer of the probe. The move is a further sign that U.S. regulators are increasing their scrutiny of the controversial and lucrative industry after years of complaints from aluminum users such as Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and its sheet supplier Novelis Inc. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) this week said its warehousing subsidiary was not driving up prices or violating any laws. The industry is also facing a possible investigation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which last week told warehousing firms not to destroy any documents related to their business. “The DOJ has opened a line of questioning to assess whether it needs to take further action,” one of the sources said. The exact nature of the letters was not immediately clear and there has been no public allegation of any illegal activity. It is not clear how advanced or broad the DOJ probe is, nor any certainty that it will result in formal charges. The DOJ declined to comment on the preliminary investigation and letter. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN.L) and Trafigura AG TRAFGF.UL - all of whom have purchased major metals warehouses in the past three years - also declined to comment. Anti-trust lawyers said the department would only launch an official investigation into the lucrative and controversial industry if it found evidence that warehousing firms had broken anti-trust laws. There has been no such indication. “I would further expect that it would be a two-pronged inquiry aimed at determining whether there has been collusion and whether there has been monopolistic behavior in geographic markets,” said U.S. anti-trust lawyer Robert Bernstein, a partner at New York-based Eaton & Van Winkle LLP, who works on behalf of U.S. copper fabricators. The initial investigation comes as banks’ multibillion-dollar commodity trading operations have come under the political spotlight. The powerful U.S. Senate banking committee held its first hearing on the issue on Tuesday, when aluminum users represented by MillerCoors LLC said high physical prices have cost the consumers an extra $3 billion a year in expenses. The Beer Institute, which represents the $250 billion beer industry and over 2,800 breweries, has met with the DOJ and urged them to take action, said a source familiar with the meeting. On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs rebutted allegations that its warehousing company Metro Trade International has violated laws by shunting metal from warehouse to warehouse. The warehouses and the London Metal Exchange, which oversees the storage outlets in its network, say the big stockpiles and high physical prices are the result of low interest rates and a market structure known as contango that make it profitable to sell metal forward and store it for months or years at a time. It is also the byproduct of LME rules which mean warehousing companies only have to deliver out a small tonnages of metal each day. According to current rules, facilities with 900,000 metric tons or more metal have to load out 3,500 metric tons Under fire from irate users, the LME has proposed a massive overhaul of its warehousing policy that would come into effect next April.

322,KO,"UPDATE 4-Publicis, Omnicom to merge to create advertising giant","* Shareholders of both firms to have 50 pct of new group * Levy, Wren to be co-CEOs during initial 30 months * Antitrust review needed in about 45 countries By Leila Abboud and Nicola Leske PARIS/NEW YORK, July 28 (Reuters) - A proposed mega-merger between global ad agencies Publicis and Omnicom  could bring rival accounts such as Coca-Cola  and PepsiCo under one firm, underscoring the scale of the $35.1 billion deal and the potential conflicts it raises. The companies said on Sunday that the deal - presented as a merger of equals - would give the combined firm the necessary scale and investment firepower to cope with rapid changes wrought by technology on the advertising business. At a press conference in Paris, the CEOs of the two companies pledged they could handle concerns from major clients who may find the marriage too close for comfort, as well as address questions from regulators who are concerned about maintaining a competitive landscape. “This is a new company for a new world,” Publicis Chief Executive Maurice Levy said. “It will be able to face the exponential development of new Internet giants like Facebook and Google, changing consumer behavior, the explosion of big data, as well as handle the blurring of roles of all the players in the market.” Levy said both companies had years of experience setting up “strict firewalls” to protect clients’ interests. Even so, the deal is likely to create some instability as rival ad agencies try to poach clients while Publicis and Omnicom are distracted by the merger. “This is going to cause turmoil within the industry,” said a senior industry executive. “Everyone is going to reassess where they stand and every company outside of Omnicom and Publicis will be all over their clients during this period.” Morningstar analyst Michael Corty said large clients, such as Omnicom’s PepsiCo, AT&T; and Microsoft Corp, as well as Publicis’ Coca-Cola, Verizon and Google Inc , were used to having leverage in negotiations as they push agencies to give them better payment terms. “We’re getting to a new frontier now and major companies might not like the change,” he said. The jumbo transaction size is rare among the world’s “Big Six” advertising groups, which have spent the past few years buying up much smaller targets in emerging markets and among Web marketing specialists. If completed, it will shift focus on those left standing alone, such as current leader WPP, U.S.-based Interpublic, France’s Havas and Japan’s Dentsu. Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, said the pressure for rivals to respond will be great. “It’s an extremely bold, brave and surprising move,” Sorrell said in an interview on Sunday. “Further consolidation of our industry is inevitable.” It all began when Levy casually mentioned the idea of a merger to Omnicom CEO John Wren at a social event in New York about six months ago. “I said it almost as a joke, but then once we each went back and reflected, it didn’t seem so crazy,” Levy said at a press conference at Publicis headquarters. The two executives later brought in Rothschild Group to advise Publicis and Moelis & Company for Omnicom, choosing independent firms instead of larger banks in part to try to prevent leaks. But when thorny issues cropped up in the talks, Wren and Levy settled things in one-to-one phone calls, the two men said. In the last 10 days leading up to the deal bankers, lawyers and  principals were basically in lockdown hammering out details, a source familiar with the matter said. The new company - Publicis Omnicom - will be traded in New York and Paris. It will overtake WPP and have combined sales of nearly $23 billion and 130,000 employees. It brings together Publicis brands such as Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett with Omnicom’s BBDO Worldwide and DDB Worldwide. The French and U.S. company said shareholders in Publicis and Omnicom would each hold about 50 percent of the new company’s equity. Wren and Levy will jointly lead the new company for the first 30 months, then Levy will become non-executive chairman and Wren CEO. The two veteran CEOs even chose the neutral territory of the Netherlands for the new holding company. Yet questions remain whether the equal nature of the marriage will stand the test of time.  Pierre Ferragu, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Research, said it could take a few years to see if the cultures of Publicis and Omnicom would blend together or if fissures appear in the so-called merger of equals. “There are mechanisms in place in the first few years to protect the parity of management so it should be fine in the transition period. But in these kinds of mergers, there are always tensions. Usually one side or the other eventually imposes its way of doing things on the other.” The new group will also have to get antitrust clearance from authorities in around 45 countries. “We’ve looked at the antitrust issues very carefully and are not expecting anything that would prevent us from going forward,” said Wren. Morningstar analyst Corty said it was unlikely the two companies would have progressed to this stage if they had doubts about getting approval. Others were less optimistic. Bert Foer, head of American Antitrust Institute, predicted that clients of the two advertising giants would object to the deal and that media companies that depend on advertising to survive would complain to antitrust authorities.  Asked about regulatory approval, he said: “I don’t think they should get it.” The main competition issue will be in media buying, where advertising agencies purchase TV or print ads on behalf of customers. Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser estimates that Publicis Omnicom will account for almost 20 percent of global media spending and closer to 40 percent in the United States. To face such concerns, the groups might have to sell small brands in some countries, said a person close to the talks. It is unlikely France will derail the deal despite the fact that a national champion is tying the knot with an American rival. Levy said the government had already expressed support for the merger.",7292013,http://www.reuters.com/article/publicis-omnicom/update-4-publicis-omnicom-to-merge-to-create-advertising-giant-idUSL6N0FY0D020130729
323,KO,"UPDATE 3-Under fire, Goldman offers way round warehouse lines","By David Sheppard and Lauren Tara LaCapra NEW YORK, July 31 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs responded to mounting political pressure and regulatory scrutiny of its Metro International metals business on Wednesday, by offering customers immediate access to aluminum stored in its warehouses. In a statement outlining the bank’s proposals to cut waiting times at all London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses, Goldman said it would let major consumers swap aluminum held in its warehouses for metal the bank has acquired, without the need to pay a steep cash premium. Customers and U.S. lawmakers have accused Goldman Sachs and other warehouse owners of artificially inflating wait times and lines to boost rents for warehouse owners and cause metal prices to rise. One major customer estimated the delays have cost consumers more than $3 billion. “We feel horrible for consumers if they can’t get metal. We don’t believe that to be the fact,” Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn, said on CNBC. Cohn, who started his career in Goldman’s commodity business, said the bank had secured metal from producers over the past week, but had yet to find a single customer ready to take it up on the offer to swap metal. Still, it marks the bank’s first effort to address years of complaints over the long waits, an issue that finally erupted last week as U.S. senators questioned why banks should be involved in owning warehousing and chartering oil tankers. The bank’s move came as a surprise to traders and end-users, many of whom had been bracing for a drawn-out investigation. It also highlights a sharp divide in how Wall Street’s biggest banks are responding to scrutiny of their physical commodity businesses. Goldman, whose J. Aron trading unit is one of the most renowned in the business, vowed to hold onto Metro, despite having considered a sale earlier this year. “We will end up selling Metro at an appropriate time,”    Cohn said. Goldman Sachs bought Metro under as a private equity exemption, he said, which allows the firm to keep it as an investment for up to 10 years. “We are staying in the commodity hedging business.” But rival JPMorgan Chase & Co. said on Friday that it was quitting the business due in part to regulatory pressures, selling or spinning off the group that includes metals warehousing firm Henry Bath & Sons, the fourth-largest storage business in the LME system. Pressure is expected to shift to traders like Glencore  and Trafigura, which also bought warehouse operators following Goldman’s purchase of Metro International Trade Services for some $550 million in early 2010. Metro’s flagship facility in Detroit stores more than 1.4 million tonnes of aluminum, a quarter of the LME’s stockpile. Over 60 percent of that is waiting to be delivered out. The news met with some positive reaction in Washington. “That’s great news and any pricing manifestations due to warehousing issues will hopefully resolve going forward,” said CFTC commissioner Bart Chilton, a frequent critic of the role of banks and other financial firms in commodity markets. Regulators including the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission have begun preliminary investigations into Wall Street banks and other large commodity traders which own metal warehouses. On Wednesday sources said Britain’s regulator was also considering a deeper investigation. “Goldman Sachs is contacting end users to offer to swap any aluminum currently in the queue for immediately available aluminum so that they have access to the metal they need to make or package their products,” the bank said. A Goldman source said the metal would be swapped out at the LME price, allowing end-users to avoid paying a cash market premium. Goldman said its offer applies only to large metal consumers like carmakers and soft drink producers, not to financial traders like hedge funds, or rival merchant commodity traders like Glencore Xstrata or Trafigura. The warehouse owners and outgoing LME CEO Martin Abbott have said the complaints over long lines are unjustified, arguing there is no shortage of metal. Instead, they said the long lines have been created by traders trying to move metal to rival warehouses that are offering financial incentives in a bid to boost their own rental income. Goldman didn’t address questions about offering financial incentives for companies to store their metal at Metro sheds, which some say contributed to the backlog of aluminum. “It sounds to me like they’re offering ice in the winter,” said U.S. anti-trust lawyer Robert Bernstein, a partner at New York-based Eaton & Van Winkle LLP, who works on behalf of U.S. copper fabricators. “The problem is the queues have jacked up the premiums.” The U.S. Senate Banking Committee held its first hearing on the warehousing issue last week, when aluminum users represented by brewer MillerCoors LLC said high physical prices have cost consumers an extra $3 billion a year in expenses. The warehouses and the LME, which oversees the storage outlets in its network, say the big stockpiles and high physical prices are the result of low interest rates and a market structure known as contango, which makes it profitable to sell metal forward and store it for months or years at a time. It is also the byproduct of LME rules, which require warehousing companies to deliver a minimum amount of tonnages of metal each day. According to current rules, facilities with 900,000 tonnes or more metal have to load out 3,500 tonnes of metal. The LME has proposed an overhaul of its warehousing policy that would come into effect in April.

325,KO,UPDATE 1-Colombia 2012 coca crop falls as illegal mining surges -U.N.,"BOGOTA/VIENNA, Aug 8 (Reuters) - Coca planting in Colombia fell by a quarter last year as the government bolstered efforts to stop the crop being turned into cocaine and crime gangs shifted to other ways of funding their operations, the United Nations said on Thursday. Coca, the raw material for cocaine production, covered 48,000 hectares of Colombia in 2012, down 25 percent from the year before, according to the annual report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The figure is the lowest since records started in 2001. One of the world’s top cocaine producers, Colombia has been battling drug-funded rebels and criminal gangs for decades. Even as a U.S.-backed military offensive has helped improve security, coca output and drug trafficking continues to help finance a 50-year conflict that has killed more than 200,000 people. “We have noticed that terrorists are looking for other sources of funding, but drug trafficking continues to fund their operations,” Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon told reporters. Insurgent groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army, as well as criminal bands, have moved into illegal mining for gold as an easier way to pay for their operations, Bo Mathiasen, the UNODC representative in Colombia, told Reuters. Coca leaf yield per hectare also declined last year. The United Nations estimates that potential cocaine production in 2012 was 309 tons, down 10 percent from 345 tons in 2011. The drop in cultivation followed an increase of 3 percent during 2011. This year’s number is far below Colombia’s 2001 peak, when coca fields occupied more than 140,000 hectares. The government’s crackdown on the drugs trade and a steady increase in metals prices in recent years, including a fivefold jump in gold prices over the last decade, has led criminal gangs to seek easier profit in the illegal extraction of minerals such as gold, coltan and tungsten. Cocaine is no longer a sufficient source of funding for 8,000-member FARC because distribution - the most lucrative side of the cocaine market - is now largely controlled by Mexican cartels, said Adam Isacson, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a U.S. non-governmental organization. He said it was easier for rebel bands and criminal gangs to operate an illegal mine than a coca field. “There is no risk of fumigation and the United States is not complaining, so the government doesn’t feel pressure to crack down on unlicensed mines,” Isacson said. The U.N. report estimated the farm-gate value of coca leaf and its derivatives, such as coca paste and cocaine base, at $370 million in 2012 - down from $422 million in 2011. It said it amounted to just 0.2 percent of Colombia’s economic output. While prices were mostly stable for cocaine base and paste, the coca leaf yield per hectare fell, and 3 percent fewer households were linked to coca production, the report said. “With the average gross income of a farmer selling coca leaf estimated at $1,220 per year, coca production does not fetch the same lucrative rewards as in the past,” the report said.

327,KO,"Buffett's Berkshire buys Suncor, Dish as stock bet grows","(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) reported new stakes in Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO) and Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) as the company run by Warren Buffett added billions of dollars of stock investments. The changes were disclosed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing made public on Thursday, which detailed $89 billion of Berkshire equity investments, mostly listed on U.S. exchanges, as of June 30. U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window into their strategies for buying and selling stocks. Berkshire took a 17.8 million-share stake in Calgary-based Suncor, which is Canada’s biggest oil and gas producer and has a large presence in the Alberta oil sands. That stake was valued at $524 million at the end of the second quarter. It also reported a small, 547,312-share stake in Dish, the satellite TV company run by billionaire Charlie Ergen, valued at $23.3 million on June 30. Suncor spokeswoman Kelli Stevens declined to comment, saying the company does not typically discuss individual investors’ holdings. Dish spokesman Bob Toevs also declined to comment. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire discloses sizable new investments because investors try to copy Buffett, the world’s fourth-richest person according to Forbes magazine. In afternoon trading, Suncor shares were up 68 cents, or 2 percent, at C$34.47. Dish shares were down 29 cents at $44.47. David McColl, a Morningstar Inc equity analyst in Chicago, said a shortage of pipelines has forced Suncor and rivals to move more products by rail, but that Suncor has indicated an ability to address this problem in the next one to five years. “Suncor is one of the most heavily undervalued Canadian integrated oil producers,” he said. “It is no surprise that a value investor like Berkshire Hathaway would view it as a phenomenal investment opportunity.” Berkshire has benefited this year from Buffett’s preference for investments in businesses and stocks over fixed income, which has been under pressure from rising interest rates. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company’s book value per share, Buffett’s preferred measure of growth, grew 7.6 percent from January to June. Its largest stock holding, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), grew 1.1 percent in the second quarter to 463.1 million shares, equal to a $19.1 billion stake in the fourth-largest U.S. bank. Berkshire spent $4.64 billion on stocks in the quarter. While Buffett has said he makes Berkshire’s largest investments, some investments are made by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who oversee several billion dollars each. Thursday’s filing did not say who bought what, but said that some holdings were reported confidentially to the SEC. Buffett sometimes gets SEC permission to amass big positions quietly so he need not worry about copycat investors. One of Berkshire’s top holdings, a $13 billion stake in International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), was built in this manner. Earlier this month, Berkshire said it ended June with $101.9 billion of equity securities overall. Its top four holdings - Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), IBM and American Express Co (AXP.N) - were worth more than $59 billion as of June 30. Berkshire also owns more than 80 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, utilities, chemicals, apparel and food. In recent months, it bought half of ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co and made several smaller acquisitions. On Wednesday, its HomeServices of America Inc unit, the second-largest U.S. full-service residential real estate brokerage, said it bought real estate service companies Prudential Fox & Roach and Trident Group for undisclosed prices. During the quarter, Berkshire added to stakes in Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), automaker General Motors Co (GM.N), oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc (NOV.N), US Bancorp (USB.N) and Verisign Inc (VRSN.O), which assigns Internet protocol addresses.

It also reported lower stakes in drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) and credit rating company Moody’s Corp (MCO.N).

330,KO,Mexico's Coca-Cola Femsa still open to more M&A; after Spaipa deal,"MONTERREY, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Mexican bottler Coca-Cola Femsa  said on Tuesday it is open to more acquisitions, just days after its $1.9 billion purchase of Brazil’s Spaipa, its ninth deal in the last two years. Hector Trevino, chief financial officer of the venture between Coca-Cola Co and Mexican retail and bottling company Femsa, said the company had the financial wherewithal to make new purchases. He said the company’s net debt would be 1.6 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by December, and that it was comfortable with a level of up to twice its EBITDA, giving it the leeway for new acquisitions. “If we were to face a purchase that requires more than that, we could also use our stock, and if not...we could also do a public stock offering,” Trevino told an analysts briefing. The Spaipa S.A. Industria Brasileira de Bebidas acquisition come on the heels of Coca-Cola Femsa’s $448 million purchase of Brazil’s Companhia Fulminense de Refigerantes. Some have said the purchases could reflect an effort to diversify away from a potentially less lucrative Mexican market. Mexico’s government is due to present a reform plan on Sunday that is expected to include a tax on fizzy drinks. It wants to raise the country’s paltry tax take by four percentage points and the move is part of a wider agenda that includes energy and telecoms reforms to boost growth in Latin America’s second-largest economy.

The probe includes two branches of the country’s sector leader, China Huiyuan Juice Group Ltd. Farmers in several Chinese provinces sold rotten fruit to distributors, which was then bought by canned fruit producers and juice manufacturers to cut costs, the 21st Century Business Herald said in the report on Monday. “We take this very seriously and have urgently deployed food safety teams in Anhui, Jiangsu, Shandong and other provinces to immediately open an investigation,” the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) said in a statement on their website, seen by Reuters on Tuesday. Food safety is a serious topic in China where scandals from milk laced with industrial chemicals to recycled “gutter oil” for cooking have left many consumers wary. A recent Pew Research report said almost four in 10 Chinese people felt that food safety was a “very big problem”. Huiyuan, once an acquisition target for The Coca-Cola Co , said that after an initial probe there was no evidence that the company had used rotten fruit to make its juice, according to a statement on its website. The CFDA added Huiyuan’s Shandong unit had not produced any juice since the end of last year, while it had not yet found any rotten fruit on site at the company’s Beijing branch.

On a conference call, Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said the world’s largest soft drink company would proceed by investing in its brands and seeking acquisitions. “There’s some headwind in emerging markets, but we believe they are very temporary” because the middle class in those countries is growing, he said. In the third quarter, net income rose 6 percent to $2.45 billion, or 54 cents per share, in the third quarter from $2.31 billion, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items such as transaction gains and tax matters, earnings were 53 cents per share, in line with what analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 3 percent to $12.03 billion from $12.34 billion, slightly below analysts’ estimates of $12.05 billion. The decline was largely due to weaker-than-expected currencies in many emerging markets and the costs of restructuring bottling operations in Brazil and the Philippines. Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said he expected currency weakness to hurt operating income by 5 percent to 6 percent in the fourth quarter. Morningstar analyst Tom Mullarkey said he was encouraged by Coke’s global volume growth, which reached 2 percent overall, as well as the popularity of the Coca-Cola brand in North America. “Soda is not doing great overall in the U.S.,” he said, “but the Coke brand is the leading soda brand, and so the company continues to push it forward.” Kent said the Coke brand was resilient, helping the company deliver a record 181 billion beverage servings in the quarter. Shares of Coca-Cola, which generates almost 60 percent of its revenue from international markets and nearly 70 percent from soft drinks, were up 0.2 percent at $37.97 in midday trading. In North America, sales volume increased 2 percent overall, largely because of the strong performance of Coke’s non-soda offerings. Still-drink and bottled water sales rose 5 percent, and teas, which include Honest Tea and Fuze, had double-digit percentage growth. Sparkling drink sales in the region were flat. Volume rose 5 percent in the Asia-Pacific region, led by growth of 21 percent in Vietnam. In China, volume increased 9 percent, including an 8 percent rise in soft drinks, without any significant pricing promotions. Executives said the nation had stabilized economically, and its people had more disposable income. Volume rose 4 percent in Eurasia and Africa, fell 1 percent in Europe and stayed flat in Latin America, in part because storms hampered beverage sales in Mexico. Also in Mexico, the government said in September that it was planning on levying taxes on soda to combat obesity. “A regressive discriminatory tax on one part of the food industry just is not going to work,” Kent said Tuesday’s call. Kent later told reporters that the company was not even sure the tax would become law. To capitalize on the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Coca-Cola has already begun its largest soccer-related marketing campaign, which will cover more than 170 markets.

Washington’s stalemate distracted investors from the beginning of a busy week of earnings. Citigroup reported weaker-than-expected results as the bank was hit by a double-digit drop in bond trading revenue for the quarter. Shares fell 0.4 percent to $49.43. Markets have rallied in the past several days as optimism grew that lawmakers would agree to end the partial government shutdown and eliminate the risk of a U.S. default by approving more borrowing authority. Representatives in the House and Senate were currently working toward separate bills. House Republicans said their plan would re-open the government and extend the debt ceiling until Feb. 7, but it included changes to the healthcare law, which the White House rejected. “Something permanent would be the most positive,” said Angel Mata, managing director of listed equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in Baltimore. “You would want a positive budget resolution and maybe a grand bargain. Those things just aren’t going to happen.” At this point, Mata said, even a stop-gap bill would boost equities. All ten S&P; sectors were down with utilities declining the sharpest, down 0.6 percent. Utilities, as big debt issuers, could see their borrowing costs rise if the U.S. delayed or defaulted on its debt payments.

Citigroup fell 1.1 percent to $49.06 after the third-largest U.S. bank reported earnings. The bank was hit by a double-digit drop in bond trading revenue after the Federal Reserve left its stimulus policies in tact in September and customer activity fell. The S&P; financial sector index was among the biggest decliners, down 1.3 percent. The political standoff in Washington showed signs of giving way to a Senate deal to reopen federal agencies and prevent an economically damaging default on federal debt. The deadline to lift debt ceiling is Oct. 17. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he was confident that Senate Democrats and Republicans can reach a comprehensive fiscal agreement this week that avoids a U.S. default on debt and other obligations. Signs of optimism are building and “investors are showing increasing signs of confidence that default will be averted,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York. House Republicans said they hope to pass a version of legislation to reopen the federal government that would differ from a plan now emerging from Senate negotiations. In a busy day of earnings, nine companies representing 5.1 percent of the S&P; 500 index report results including Yahoo! Inc  and Intel Corp after the bell. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 24.82 points, or 0.16 percent, at 15,276.44. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  was down 1.90 points, or 0.11 percent, at 1,708.24. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was up 3.42 points, or 0.09 percent, at 3,818.69. Johnson & Johnson reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results on strong growth for its prescription drugs. The stock was up 1.4 percent at $91.08. Coca-Cola Co reported higher earnings and lower revenue, helped by strong global sales of its Coca-Cola brand products.

On Day 15 of the U.S. government shutdown, Congress showed signs of giving way to a Senate deal to reopen federal agencies and prevent an economically damaging default on federal debt.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, and his Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, ended a day of talks with optimistic proclamations. In earnings, Citigroup Inc reported a marginal fall in adjusted quarterly profit from ongoing businesses after the Federal Reserve’s decision to continue its bond-buying program for longer than expected slowed trading by clients. The stock was off 0.7 percent at $49.27. S&P; 500 futures lost 0.8 points and were in line with fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures added 7 points while Nasdaq 100 futures added 6.25 points. Futures were higher prior to Citigroup’s results on signs of progress in Washington toward a deal to reopen the government and lift the debt ceiling as the Oct. 17 deadline looms. In a busy day of earnings, nine companies representing 5.1 percent of the S&P; 500 index report results including Yahoo! Inc  and Intel Corp after the bell.

Johnson & Johnson reported stronger-than-expected quarterly results on strong growth for its prescription drugs, including new treatments for cancer and to prevent blood clots, and the company slightly raised its full-year profit forecast. The stock was up 1.3 percent at $91.00.

The plan, which was passed by lawmakers after markets closed, aims to curb rising obesity levels as well as lift Mexico’s poor tax take. Shares of Mexico-based Coca-Cola Femsa, Coke’s largest bottler in Latin America, closed down 1.28 percent at 159.02 pesos. Mexico, where obesity rates are now higher than in the United States, will be the first major soda market to tax high-calorie sodas, following a handful of other Latin American and European countries. Mexicans are the world’s biggest soda drinkers, guzzling about 707 8-ounce (0.24 liter) servings, on average, per year, according to U.S. newsletter Beverage Digest. The United States is the only other country in the same ballpark, clocking in at 701 servings. Drink and snack food companies are expected to pass on the tax to consumers, which could put further pressure on economic growth which has slowed this year in Mexico, hurt by a drop in consumer spending. Coke Femsa executives said on a call last week that they would pass on the tax by raising prices broadly between 12 and 15 percent. “We think the industry will do the same thing because it’s a heavy tax,” Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino told analysts on a call. “Our operators are already looking at some of the strategies that we’ll follow for next year and that includes doing a full reconfiguration of our whole portfolio, even doing some downsizing,” Trevino added. The company said it could reduce its workforce by around 3 or 4 percent and cut back on distribution routes. Coca-Cola controls more than three-quarters of Mexico’s drinks market and stands to be hit the hardest by the soda tax, according to Beverage Digest. Much smaller players in the market include PepsiCo and Dr Pepper Snapple Group. Coke Femsa did not respond to requests for comment, while a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola referred calls to Mexico’s beverages association ANPRAC. Mexico’s tax could be a “game changer” as “the first of the large soft-drink consumer markets to impose a significant excise tax on full-calorie soft drinks,” wrote analysts at Credit Suisse in a report last month. Other countries and jurisdictions may consider following suit, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Telluride, Colorado’s 800 registered voters will weigh in on a proposal to put a 1-cent per ounce tax on sugary drinks on November 5, sponsor Elisa Marie Overall said. If it passes, the small ski resort town would be the first in the United States to institute such a tax. There also is a move afoot in San Francisco to put a proposed 2-cent per ounce soda tax on the ballot in November 2014. Mexico’s one peso per liter tax is the equivalent to about 0.23 cents per U.S. ounce. A liter of Coke - 33.8 U.S. ounces - costs about 12 pesos ($0.92).

CC HBC buys syrup concentrate from Coca-Cola and then bottles and distributes the U.S. group’s drinks in 28 countries from Russia to Nigeria. Tough economic conditions in Greece, Italy, Hungary and Romania and slower growth in the bottler’s biggest market, Russia, hit sales. Volume declined 3 percent to 575 million unit cases, lower than analysts had forecast. Significant cost savings offset some of the sales decline and foreign exchange losses.

The investment will add to the $4 billion that the world’s largest drinks maker has earmarked for China in 2012-2014, said Asia-based spokeswoman Sharolyn Choy, confirming a Bloomberg report earlier on Friday. The beverage maker is also open to deals with local firms, Choy said. Analysts said this could help it play the trend in China toward more local-style herbal teas and healthier drinks. Chinese consumers are increasingly opting for healthier alternatives in food and drink, which has hit growth for fast food chains such as McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N). “The beverage market is quite competitive right now and Coke is going to have to do a lot more acquisitions rather than growing through organic growth,” said Shaun Rein, Shanghai-based managing director of China Market Research Group. “It is starting to compete against some really well-capitalized local players like JDB, which has a herbal tea called ‘JDB Red Can’ that out-sells Coke in many provinces in China and is double the price.” Coca-Cola is still the leading drinks maker in China. It held 16 percent market share by total volume in 2012, down from 16.6 percent five years ago, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor. Ting Hsin International Group, which owns food and beverage maker Tingyi Cayman Islands Holding Corp (0322.HK), is the second-largest drinks maker.

354,KO,UPDATE 1-GrainCorp CEO heads for Coca-Cola Amatil after ADM deal scrapped,"* Alison Watkins quits GrainCorp to head local Coke bottler * Move follows Australia blocking ADM’s A$2.8 bln GrainCorp takeover * GrainCorp shares slip 1.4 percent, CCA shares rise SYDNEY, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The chief executive of GrainCorp Ltd has resigned just days after Australia’s government rejected a takeover of the grains handler by U.S. agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland Inc. Alison Watkins, who she had planned to leave GrainCorp once ADM had secured control of the company, will take over as managing director of Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd (CCA), the bottler said on Monday. Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey rejected ADM’s A$2.8 billion ($2.6 billion) bid for GrainCorp on Friday, bowing to pressure from grain growers in a rare and surprising decision. “The expectation in the investment community was that ADM’s offer for GrainCorp would be approved and effected in the near term,” said Graincorp Chairman Don Taylor, who will assume a temporary role as executive chairman while a search for a replacement is conducted. “In that context, it is not surprising that an executive of Alison’s calibre has attracted interest and had new opportunities presented to her.” CCA said Watkins, who ran GrainCorp for three-and-a-half years, would start in March. Shares in GrainCorp, which plunged by almost a quarter on Friday after Hockey rejected ADM’s bid, were down 1.4 percent on Monday. The company, which dominates Australia’s east coast grains handling and storage business, has been diversifying with recent deals in the malting and oil seeds businesses. Its earnings however have come under pressure as grains harvests retreat from record volumes. CCA shares rose 1.7 percent.

360,KO,Possible heir apparent emerges at Coke after company shakeup,"(Reuters) - The surprise departure of a potential Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) chief executive has put the global chief customer officer in contention to eventually succeed CEO Muhtar Kent. The world’s largest beverage company said on Thursday that Steve Cahillane, head of all Coca-Cola operations in the Americas, would leave the company as part of a major organizational shakeup. That has put Sandy Douglas, a previous head of the North American operation and currently global chief customer officer, in the running for the top job when 61-year-old Kent retires, analysts said. A chief customer officer typically runs strategy to maximize customer acquisition, retention and profitability. Coke said it would split its North American businesses into separate units - one for bottling and another for branding and marketing, the latter headed by Douglas. Cahillane has long been considered Kent’s heir apparent. Coke said only that he was leaving to “pursue other opportunities.” “We have previously believed Cahillane to be a strong CEO-successor, but given the sudden and unexpected nature of his departure announcement, we can’t help but wonder what happened?,” Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a note. Cahillane joined Coke from Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc CCE.N when the company bought CCE’s North American operations in 2010 and created the Coca-Cola Refreshments division. Coca-Cola Enterprises, now Coke’s bottler in Western Europe, was Coke’s main U.S. bottler at the time. He became head of Coca-Cola Americas, the company’s North American and Latin American operations, in 2012. “Under Steve’s leadership, our North America business delivered several consecutive quarters of volume and value share gains, despite operating in a very difficult economic environment the past three years,” Kent said in a statement. Coca-Cola generates almost 60 percent of its revenue from international markets and nearly 70 percent from soft drinks. But in the United States, soda sales have been declining for years as customers choose healthier options such as fruit juices and organic milk. Coke brands include Dasani mineral water and Minute Maid juices but it faces much more competition in these markets. The company said its Coca-Cola Refreshments bottling business will become part of the Bottling Investment Group (BIG), which houses the company’s bottling operations outside North America. It will be headed by Paul Mulligan, who has been the regional director of BIG in Japan and Latin America. The company’s Latin American operations will be merged with its international operations. JP Morgan analyst John Faucher said the implications of Coke’s management shake-up and organizational changes were difficult to assess and he kept his “neutral” rating on the stock. Coca-Cola's shares were up 0.6 percent at $39.43 in midday trading. They have risen 9 percent this year, underperforming the broader S&P; 500 .SPX, which has risen 24.5 percent.

POM Wonderful has accused Coke of falsely labeling and advertising the juice product, saying the beverage giant misled consumers into believing the drink, marketed under the Minute Maid brand, consisted primarily of pomegranate and blueberry juices. POM, which produces its own pomegranate-based juice products, says the drink contained mainly apple and grape juices.

The 9th Circuit upheld the lower court’s judgment in favor of Coca-Cola on other federal law claims. POM sought Supreme Court review of that part of the decision. The legal question is whether the 9th Circuit was wrong to conclude that POM, as a private party, could not make its complaint under a federal trademark law when the product in question was regulated under the U.S. Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

369,KO,Coca-Cola takes $1.25 billion stake in Green Mountain,"(Reuters) - Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc, maker of the popular Keurig single-cup coffee brewer, said on Wednesday that the Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) bought a 10 percent stake in it for $1.25 billion and would help launch Green Mountain’s new cold drink machine planned for next year. Shares in Green Mountain GMCR.O soared 39.7 percent to $113.01 in extended trading, while those of its likely new rival, SodaStream International Ltd (SODA.O), tumbled almost 10 percent to $32.01. Under their 10-year agreement, Green Mountain and Coca-Cola will collaborate on the development and introduction of Coca-Cola products on Green Mountain’s upcoming in-home cold beverage machine that will serve both carbonated and non-carbonated beverages, including soft drinks, tea and juice. The deal will make Green Mountain the exclusive partner for the production and sale of Coca-Cola’s branded single-serve, pod-based cold beverages, the companies said. Green Mountain’s Keurig machine popularized the use of pods - containing everything from coffee, tea or hot chocolate powder - for easy, in-home, one-cup brewing of hot drinks. Its upcoming cold drink machine also will use pods and will carry products from multiple brands, Green Mountain’s President and Chief Executive Brian Kelley said on a conference call with reporters. “This gives Green Mountain a beverage partner with some hugely powerful global brands. For Coke, it gives them access to some really cool, new cutting-edge pod cold-beverage technology,” said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. “It gives them (Coke) access to a new channel,” said Sicher. He said soda sales in the United States have been in decline since 2005, while growth in pod-based coffee brewing has boomed. Under the terms of the agreement, Coca-Cola will acquire roughly 16.7 million newly issued shares of Green Mountain. The new shares have been priced at $74.98, which represents the trailing 50-trading-day volume weighted average price as of market close. The significant after-hours move in Green Mountain’s stock appeared to be a classic short squeeze as traders who bet against the stock scrambled to cover their positions. David Einhorn, who runs hedge fund Greenlight Capital Inc., was among investors with short positions in Green Mountain as of October 15. Greenlight’s spokesman declined to comment to Reuters on Wednesday. The most recent data from Nasdaq, which dates to January 15, had short interest in Green Mountain at about 25 percent of shares outstanding - about 37.6 million shares. That’s lower than peak short interest in November 2012, when more than 51 million shares were being shorted. The average consumer staples company has just 1.6 percent of shares held short, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine. Green Mountain separately reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday. The Waterbury, Vermont-based company reported net income of $138.2 million, or 91 cents per share, for the fiscal first quarter ended December 28, up from $107.6 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 96 cents per share - 6 cents better than analysts on average had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

370,KO,UPDATE 2-Coca-Cola takes $1.25 billion stake in Green Mountain,"By Lisa Baertlein and Phil Wahba Feb 5 (Reuters) - Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc, maker of the popular Keurig single-cup coffee brewer, said on Wednesday that the Coca-Cola Co bought a 10 percent stake in it for $1.25 billion and would help launch Green Mountain’s new cold drink machine planned for next year. Shares in Green Mountain soared 39.7 percent to $113.01 in extended trading, while those of its likely new rival, SodaStream International Ltd, tumbled almost 10 percent to $32.01. Under their 10-year agreement, Green Mountain and Coca-Cola will collaborate on the development and introduction of Coca-Cola products on Green Mountain’s upcoming in-home cold beverage machine that will serve both carbonated and non-carbonated beverages, including soft drinks, tea and juice. The deal will make Green Mountain the exclusive partner for the production and sale of Coca-Cola’s branded single-serve, pod-based cold beverages, the companies said. Green Mountain’s Keurig machine popularized the use of pods - containing everything from coffee, tea or hot chocolate powder - for easy, in-home, one-cup brewing of hot drinks. Its upcoming cold drink machine also will use pods and will carry products from multiple brands, Green Mountain’s President and Chief Executive Brian Kelley said on a conference call with reporters. “This gives Green Mountain a beverage partner with some hugely powerful global brands. For Coke, it gives them access to some really cool, new cutting-edge pod cold-beverage technology,” said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. “It gives them (Coke) access to a new channel,” said Sicher. He said soda sales in the United States have been in decline since 2005, while growth in pod-based coffee brewing has boomed. Under the terms of the agreement, Coca-Cola will acquire roughly 16.7 million newly issued shares of Green Mountain. The new shares have been priced at $74.98, which represents the trailing 50-trading-day volume weighted average price as of market close. The significant after-hours move in Green Mountain’s stock appeared to be a classic short squeeze as traders who bet against the stock scrambled to cover their positions. David Einhorn, who runs hedge fund Greenlight Capital Inc., was among investors with short positions in Green Mountain as of Oct. 15. Greenlight’s spokesman declined to comment to Reuters on Wednesday. The most recent data from Nasdaq, which dates to Jan. 15, had short interest in Green Mountain at about 25 percent of shares outstanding - about 37.6 million shares. That’s lower than peak short interest in November 2012, when more than 51 million shares were being shorted. The average consumer staples company has just 1.6 percent of shares held short, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine. Green Mountain separately reported better-than-expected  quarterly profit on Wednesday. The Waterbury, Vermont-based company reported net income of $138.2 million, or 91 cents per share, for the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 28, up from $107.6 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 96 cents per share - 6 cents better than analysts on average had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose almost percent to $1.39 billion. Green Mountain also plans to launch a new hot drink brewing system this fall.

372,KO,UPDATE 1-Coke's bet on Green Mountain seen putting SodaStream into play,"* SodaStream shares up on takeover speculation * Experts say Coke could take larger stake in Green Mountain * Make-at-home soda market still small * Green Mountain deal marks Coke’s return to in-home soda making   (Adds comment by industry expert, comment by SodaStream, industry background, closing share prices) By Lisa Baertlein Feb 6 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co’s $1.3 billion investment in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc puts pressure on at-home soda leader SodaStream International Ltd  to bolster its position through a partnership or merger with the likes of a PepsiCo Inc or Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. Coke’s move on Wednesday to buy 10 percent of the maker of the popular Keurig one-cup coffee brewer and exclusively sell Coke products on its upcoming cold drink machine  is fueling speculation that the world’s largest soda company could eventually buy the rest of Green Mountain, which would spur other deals in the sector, analysts said. The Coke deal eliminates SodaStream’s “best potential partner and creates a new level of competition,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Scott Van Winkle said in a note. Shares of SodaStream rose 7.2 percent to close at $38.35 on the Nasdaq on Thursday, buoyed by takeover speculation. Soft drink makers - who have seen U.S. soda sales decline since 2005 - are warily watching trends such as at-home soda making and so-called water enhancers, such as Kraft Foods Group’s Mio brand. They are unlikely to let a rival  get too far out in front, analysts said. “It’s tit-for-tat” with Coke and Pepsi, said Bevmark Consulting Chief Executive Officer Tom Pirko. Pepsi last year shot down rumors that it had approached Israel-based SodaStream with a $2 billion buyout offer. Pepsi declined to comment for this story and Dr Pepper Snapple did not respond to requests for comment. SodaStream said in an email that it viewed the Coke-Green Mountain deal as “further recognition that custom carbonation is the future of the ... at-home carbonated beverage industry.” While some industry experts hailed the Coke-Green Mountain deal as historic or groundbreaking, Pirko called it a tentative step for Coke, which in the late 1980s launched a home and office soda machine called BreakMate. BreakMate fizzled after the machines were plagued by problems and consumers realized it cost less to buy two-liter bottles of soda at the store. “People shouldn’t misjudge this as a revolution in the soft drink business,” Pirko said of the Coke-Green Mountain deal.     Coke is “testing the temperature of the water to see if they want to dive in.” Coke has made a handful of bite-by-bite acquisitions - including Honest Tea - to expand the types of drinks it offers. ONE-WAY EXCLUSIVITY While companies such as Starbucks Corp and Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc have deals to provide coffee pods for the Keurig coffee machine, Coke took the extra step of investing in Green Mountain as it prepares to launch its single-serving cold drink machine as soon as October. Coke drink pods will be exclusive on Green Mountain’s new machine, but Green Mountain’s machine will use products from other drink makers. The investment decision from Coke “causes us to wonder if this could be the first step in ultimately acquiring a larger stake in (Green Mountain),” Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a client note. Shares of Green Mountain closed 26.2 percent higher at $102.10 on Thursday. They jumped more than 50 percent in extended trade on Wednesday after the Coke deal was announced. The gains prompted some short sellers to make fresh bets that Green Mountain’s stock price would drop. Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management, shorted Green Mountain at $128 a share on Wednesday evening. “It is uncertain that the home soda market is all that large and whether it is taking market share,” said Kass. “The heaviest users of SodaStream use it for sparkling water, as the flavor market and usage has been slow to develop,” Kass said in a note to clients. John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, called the Coke-Green Mountain deal a win-win, saying it gives the soda company a new avenue for growth with new technology that is cutting-edge and cool. But skeptics point out that Green Mountain’s cold drink machine is still unproven, that the price consumers will pay for pods has not been announced, and that Coke’s main challenge is to tempt consumers with new, premium drinks. “In our opinion, one of Coke’s problems ... is not routes-to-market but innovation in the bottle,” Stifel analyst Mark Swartzberg said in a client note. Another Stifel analyst, Jim Duffy, estimated SodaStream’s global retail sales at about $100 million annually. That suggests Coke’s potential retail sales on Green Mountain’s new cold beverage machine would make just a small contribution to its net revenue, which was $12 billion in the third quarter.

373,KO,"US STOCKS-Wall St rallies on labor market data, earnings","* Initial jobless claims decline more than expected * Twitter slumps after results; LinkedIn off after the bell * Green Mountain surges on deal with Coca-Cola * Indexes up: Dow 1.22 pct, S&P; 1.24 pct, Nasdaq 1.14 pct By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Feb 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks posted their best day of the year on Thursday after a drop in applications for unemployment insurance boosted confidence in the economy and Disney’s results overshot expectations. The rally came ahead of the widely-followed payrolls report for January due Friday, which some are expecting to be affected by the extreme weather that hit much of the United States. December’s number was a much-lower-than-expected 74,000 and an upward revision wouldn’t be a surprise. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits declined 20,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 331,000. While the data has no direct bearing on January’s employment report it bodes well for the jobs market and the overall economy. “Investors recently have been choosing to look at the glass half empty data and not focus on the positives,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. “Bad weather causes cancellations, flight problems, business closings. I’m hoping we get an upward revision to the December (payrolls) number tomorrow, but if we get a lousy number I’m not going to crawl under a rock.” Recent soft data added to jitters about growth in China and a selloff in emerging market currencies and stocks. But a near 6 percent decline on the S&P; 500 from its record high last month to the session low Wednesday was seen by some as a buying opportunity, as earnings continue to grow. Walt Disney was the most recent bellwether to beat expectations as its profit topped estimates, sending its shares up 5.3 percent to $75.56. Disney led gains on both the Dow industrials and S&P; 500. According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 330 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 68.8 percent have topped Wall Street expectations, above the 63 percent beat rate since 1994 and the 67 percent rate for the past four quarters. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 188.3 points or 1.22 percent, to 15,628.53, the S&P; 500 gained 21.79 points or 1.24 percent, to 1,773.43 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 45.57 points or 1.14 percent, to 4,057.122. It was the largest daily percentage gain for the S&P; 500 and Dow since mid-December. However, the S&P; was on track for its fourth consecutive negative week, a streak not seen since July-August of 2011. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, one of the most shorted stocks on Wall Street, surged 26.2 percent to $102.10. Coca-Cola bought a 10 percent stake for $1.25 billion and said it would help launch Green Mountain’s new cold drink machine. Coke shares gained 1.1 percent to $38.03 while home beverage device maker SodaStream International rose 7.2 percent to $38.35. The Nasdaq also received a boost from Akamai Technologies , which soared 20.6 percent to $57.18 after forecasting better-than-expected results. Bucking the bullish trend, Spirit AeroSystems shares fell 19.6 percent to $26.51. The major supplier of components to Boeing and Airbus, reported a quarterly loss on charges tied mainly to the Boeing 787 program. After the closing bell, LinkedIn shares fell 8 percent following its results and outlook. About 6.9 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, below the 7.9 billion average of the past five sessions, according to data from BATS Global Markets. On the NYSE, advancing issues outnumbered those falling by a ratio of more than 3 to 1. On the Nasdaq, more than nine issues rose for every five that fell. Other economic data showed the U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in December as exports fell, which could see the advance fourth-quarter growth estimate trimmed. Nonfarm productivity rose more than expected in the fourth quarter, but weak unit labor costs pointed to subdued wage inflation.",2062014,http://www.reuters.com/article/markets-usa-stocks/us-stocks-wall-st-rallies-on-labor-market-data-earnings-idUSL2N0LB1YQ20140206

375,KO,Big bets on Green Mountain ahead of Coke stake raise eyebrows,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A surge in bets that shares of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters would rise sharply by the end of the week has raised suspicions, coming as it did just hours before news of a partnership deal with Coca-Cola (KO.N). Green Mountain GMCR.O said late Wednesday Coca-Cola bought a 10 percent stake for $1.25 billion and would help launch Green Mountain’s new cold-drink machine, planned for release as soon as October. To be successful, many of the bets - call options conferring the right to buy Green Mountain shares at a specific price before midnight Friday - required the shares to rise to $90 or $95, roughly a 12 percent to 18 percent increase over two days. The shares, which closed at $80.88 on Wednesday before the announcement, were up 26.5 percent at $102.29 on Thursday afternoon. Earlier they traded as high as $110.50. “We noticed the out-of-the-money ones which were definitely a bit suspicious. To wait until the last minute before some sort of announcement to buy something that expires so soon, that does raise an eyebrow,” said Ryan Detrick, senior analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati. A call option with a “strike” price significantly higher than that of the underlying stock is described as being out of the money. “It’s safe to say that if they bought (the contracts) anytime yesterday, they easily made over 1,000 percent near the open today,” Detrick said. The total volume of call options, which generally convey bullish expectations for a stock, surged in Green Mountain on Wednesday, jumping to 53,681 contracts from a recent daily average of about 13,000 contracts, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. The $95 strikes closed on Wednesday at 46 cents per contract. Since one contract accounts for 100 shares of a stock, a purchase of 1,000 call options would cost about $46,000. Those options were trading on Thursday at $10.10 per contract, which would make 1,000 calls worth about $1.01 million. Among the biggest open interest changes were in the $90 strike call, which added 2,688 contracts to bring open interest to a total of 4,553 contracts, and the $95 calls, where volume of 1,695 contracts brought open interest to 2,475, according to Trade Alert. Suspicious activity in options market ahead of major announcements is not new. While some of the bets could be pure speculation, regulators have been increasing their surveillance of suspicious action prior to big announcements. The CBOE’s Department of Market Regulation “does review unusual trading activity on a regular basis,” a CBOE spokesperson said, but it does not comment on any specific situations. A spokesperson for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declined comment. A spokesperson at Green Mountain did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In addition, the company reported earnings on Wednesday, and expectations headed into the report was for a move of about 15 percent in the shares. Activity in bearish put options was also greater than normal, according to Trade Alert. “Green Mountain had earnings coming out and implied volatility was high since earnings are a big deal anyway to the company,” said Brian Overby, senior options analyst at TradeKing in Charlotte, North Carolina. “But if something way out-of-the-money (contracts) were bought for the open and weren’t closing for anything, that is speculation.” In August, a former Green Mountain employee was charged by the SEC with participating in an insider trading scheme, where bets would be made using out-of-the-money options prior to earnings reports.

The rally comes ahead of the widely-followed payrolls report due Friday, which some are expecting to be affected by the extreme cold weather that has hit much of the United States.

The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week, in a boost to the labor market outlook and the broader economy. Walt Disney Co shares climbed 5.4 percent to $75.61 to lead both the Dow and S&P; 500 higher after the media company’s quarterly profit topped Wall Street expectations. “Disney is up strong on good earnings. You’ve got a number of names bouncing back here,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. As the U.S. Federal Reserve continues to wind down its stimulus, investors have turned their focus to fundamentals such as corporate earnings and economic data. However, many participants have reservations whether the recent soft data truly reflects the economy or is the result of a harsh winter. Friday’s payrolls report may not provide a clearer indication of the economy’s health after last month’s disappointing number. “All eyes are on tomorrow’s employment report number, although whatever it is, it’s going to be quickly dismissed because of weather. People will say it’s either overstated or understated,” said Ghriskey. Twitter Inc shares tumbled 19.6 percent to $53.01  after the social media reported slow user growth, dimming hopes the company could sustain its torrid expansion. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc surged 27.1 percent to $102.80 as the top boost to the Nasdaq 100  index. Coca-Cola Co bought a 10 percent stake for $1.25 billion and said it would help launch Green Mountain’s new cold drink machine.

Other economic data showed the U.S. trade deficit widened more than expected in December as exports fell, which could see the advance fourth-quarter growth estimate trimmed. Nonfarm productivity rose more than expected in the fourth quarter, but weak unit labor costs pointed to subdued wage inflation. According to Thomson Reuters data, of the 330 companies in the S&P; 500 that have reported earnings through Thursday morning, 68.8 percent have topped Wall Street expectations, above the 63 percent beat rate since 1994 and the 67 percent rate for the past four quarters. The Nasdaq also received a boost from Akamai Technologies , which soared 18.3 percent to $56.09 after forecasting better-than-expected results for the current quarter. General Motors shed 0.3 percent to $34.98. The automaker posted weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Thursday as results in North America, Asia and South America disappointed. Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc reported a 23 percent rise in quarterly profit, driven by higher sales at its Dunkin’ Donuts coffee and sandwich outlets. The company also boosted its quarterly dividend and announced a new $125 million share buyback plan. Its shares advanced 5.1 percent to $49.70.

Rexam, which makes cans for Coca-Cola, PepsiCo Inc  and Heineken, said UAC’s plant in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, has an annual capacity of 1.8 billion cans. UAC had earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $29 million in 2012, London-based Rexam said. “Growth prospects for the beverage can in the Middle East are attractive,” Rexam Chief Executive Graham Chipchase said in a statement. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2014. Rexam, which set up an office in Dubai last year to focus on Africa, the Middle East and Asia, said in November that it expected emerging markets such as Brazil and India to perform well in 2014. UAC’s shareholders include Olayan Financing Company, Aujan Industries Co LLC, The Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Saudi Arabia and Al-Jabr Trading Company.

The index was up 1.4 percent for the week, rallying from six-week lows at the beginning of February.

389,KO,Coke revenue misses estimates as soda sales slow,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co’s (KO.N) quarterly global sales volumes rose less than the company estimated and fell in North America, but the company said it expects to restore sales momentum in 2014. Coca-Cola shares fell as much as 4.3 percent - their most in seven months - making the stock the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrials index .DJI on Tuesday. Coca-Cola, like rival PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, has been battling declining soda sales in developed markets, especially the United States, as people reach for healthier options. Both have responded by focusing more on juices, teas, water and other non-carbonated beverages and increasing marketing spending. Coca-Cola bought a 10 percent stake in Keurig coffee maker Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc GMCR.O earlier this month, and will help develop a cold-beverage dispenser that it hopes will boost at-home consumption of fizzy drinks. Coca-Cola said on Tuesday that global sales volumes rose 1 percent in the quarter and 2 percent for the full year. Volumes in North America fell 1 percent in the quarter, while those in Europe grew just 1 percent as consumer spending remained subdued. Chief Executive Muhtar Kent said the company would restore its sales momentum in 2014 by increasing investments in advertising, adding that U.S. sales were expected to improve slightly this year. The company reported flat net revenue in North America in the fourth quarter. Coca-Cola led the U.S. carbonated soft drink market in 2012, with a market share of about 42 percent, according to industry newsletter Beverage Digest. Pepsi had a 28.1 percent share. “Overall, (Coca-Cola) had relatively soft top-line results,” Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a note. However, RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi was positive on the company’s full-year prospects. Modi said he expects Coca-Cola sales volumes to improve as the company pumps more money into marketing in the United States than Pepsi. Coca-Cola said it expected to save $1 billion annually through productivity improvements by 2016 and redirect much of this into increased advertising and marketing. The company raised its savings target to $1 billion from $600 million due to higher bottling cost savings. Herzog said she expects the increased productivity savings to re-accelerate earnings growth over the next several years. Janney Capital Markets analyst Jonathan Feeney said he expected growth in 2014 to be driven by reinvestments, pricing actions and new products such as Coca-Cola Life, a drink sweetened with sugar and stevia. PepsiCo has also been cutting costs in the face of weak soda sales in North America. The company said last week it would look to save $1 billion annually through 2019 by closing plants and increasing automation. Coca-Cola’s quarterly revenue fell 3.6 percent to $11.04 billion, in part because of the loss in revenue from its bottling operations it sold in Brazil and the Philippines last year. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates and the separation of the bottling operations, revenue rose 4 percent. Coca-Cola said it expects unfavorable currency rates to have a 10 percent impact on operating income in the first quarter and 7 percent in the full year. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $11.31 billion in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s net income fell to $1.71 billion, or 38 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended December 31, from $1.86 billion, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 46 cents per share, in-line with the average analyst estimate. Operating income fell 4 percent in the quarter, hurt by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and other items. Coca-Cola shares, which rose 5.6 percent in the 12 months to Friday’s close, were down 3.8 percent at $37.43 in midday trading. PepsiCo’s shares have risen 8 percent in the past year. Shares of both companies trade at about 17 times forward earnings. ",2182014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cocacola-results/coke-revenue-misses-estimates-as-soda-sales-slow-idUSBREA1H0WH20140218

EPS $0.46, in line with estimates * Sales fall 4 pct to $11.04 bln vs est $11.31 bln * Global sales volume rises 1 pct * Shares fall as much as 4 pct By Siddharth Cavale Feb 18 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co’s quarterly global sales volumes rose less than the company estimated and fell in North America, but the company said it expects to restore sales momentum in 2014. Coca-Cola shares fell as much as 4.3 percent - their most in seven months - making the stock the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrials index on Tuesday. Coca-Cola, like rival PepsiCo Inc, has been battling declining soda sales in developed markets, especially the United States, as people reach for healthier options. Both have responded by focusing more on juices, teas, water and other non-carbonated beverages and increasing marketing spending. Coca-Cola bought a 10 percent stake in Keurig coffee maker Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc earlier this month, and will help develop a cold-beverage dispenser that it hopes will boost at-home consumption of fizzy drinks.

391,KO,Egyptian militants warn tourists to leave or face attack,"CAIRO (Reuters) - A militant Islamist group has warned tourists to leave Egypt and threatened to attack any who stay after February 20, raising the prospect of a new front in a fast-growing insurgency in the biggest Arab nation. The Sinai-based Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis group, which claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed two South Korean tourists and an Egyptian on Sunday, made the statement on an affiliated Twitter account. “We recommend tourists to get out safely before the expiry of the deadline,” read the tweet, written in English, which Egypt’s prime minister said on Tuesday aimed to undermine the political process begun after an army takeover in July. Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis has said that it does not post statements on social media sites, but statements that appeared on the Twitter account in the past have afterwards surfaced on jihadist websites which the group says it does use. Islamist militants have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers since the army deposed Islamist president Mohamed Mursi seven months ago, but Sunday’s attack on a tourist bus marks a tactical shift to soft targets that could devastate an economy already reeling from political turmoil. State television quoted Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi as saying Ansar was a threat to tourists. It aimed, he said, to derail the roadmap to elections unveiled by the army when Mursi’s fall provoked the bloodiest internal crisis in Egypt’s modern history. Ansar has said it was behind Sunday’s suicide bombing near the resort of Taba, which revived memories of an Islamist insurgency in the 1990s including a 1997 bloodbath at Luxor, when 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians were killed at a pharaoh’s temple. On Monday, Germany’s foreign ministry changed its travel advice, telling travellers to be cautious about going to Egypt. It specifically discouraged travel to the Nile Delta outside the urban centers of Cairo and Alexandria and to the Nile Valley south of Cairo to north of Luxor. Egypt’s Western allies had hoped the uprising that toppled president Hosni Mubarak in 2011 would bring political and economic stability to a country at the heart of the Arab world. Instead, turmoil has gripped the nation of 85 million, which has a strategic peace treaty with Israel and controls the Suez Canal, a vital global shipping lane. In another sign of instability, an explosion wounded four Egyptian soldiers in the Sinai on Tuesday, state-run Al Ahram newspaper reported on its website. Tourism was a major employer and accounted for more than 10 percent of gross domestic product before the revolt. Visitors are again sharply down since army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi deposed Mursi, Mubarak’s successor. Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, Egypt’s most active Islamist militant organization, has threatened to topple the interim government installed by Sisi, who is expected to run for president. The Egyptian state and militants are old foes. Islamist-leaning soldiers assassinated President Anwar al-Sadat in 1981 mainly because of his peace treaty with Israel. It took Mubarak years to put down the 1990s insurgency which targeted senior government officials and foreign visitors, gutting tourism. Ansar enjoys tacit support from at least some of the marginalized Bedouin community and smugglers in the Sinai. This has enabled them to survive several army offensives in the largely lawless peninsula. “Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis poses the most formidable security threat in current-day Egypt,” said Anthony Skinner, Middle East and North Africa director at risk analysis firm Maplecroft. “This is not only reflected in the attack on the tourist bus in Taba last weekend, but also in the series of bombings in the Nile Valley and Nile Delta regions.” In one of the boldest attacks claimed by Ansar, a car bomb killed 16 people at a security force headquarters in the Delta city of Mansoura on December 24. The attack was claimed on the same Twitter account before jihadist sites carried the statement. While security forces have crushed Mursi’s Muslim Brotherhood, a political movement that had forsworn violence decades ago, Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis has become more brazen. The group has extended its reach beyond the Sinai to cities including Cairo, where it claimed responsibility for an assassination attempt on the interior minister. The group also said it was behind the shooting death of an Interior Ministry general. “This statement, if genuine, would add tourism quite explicitly to the target set already outlined by Ansar, which includes security forces and economic interests of the state and the army,” said Anna Boyd, an analyst at London-based IHS Jane’s. An army source told Reuters that the latest attacks were a reaction to a military offensive which was hurting militants. “They are breathing their last breath,” he said.

Economic reports were disappointing. U.S. homebuilder confidence suffered its largest one-month drop ever in February, and the New York Federal Reserve’s gauge of manufacturing showing weaker-than-expected reading, but investors quickly shifted focus to more market-positive news in mergers and acquisitions. “Much of the recent concern over the health of the U.S. economy has been explained at the hands of the weather,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut. Shares of Forest Laboratories Inc rocketed nearly 30 percent after Actavis said it would acquire the specialty pharmaceuticals company in a massive cash and stock deal valued at about $25 billion. “Just the fact that acquisitions are being made shows that prices aren’t completely out of whack. That’s supportive to the market and it certainly shifts investors’ focus from profit taking,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. Tesla Motors Inc shares hit an all-time high following a report Apple’s mergers and acquisitions chief, Adrian Perica, met Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk last year, sparking speculation Apple could be interested in buying the electric car maker. Tesla shares rose 3.3 percent to $204.91 after hitting an all-time intraday high of $205.72. Apple shares were up 1.1 percent at $549.80. Coca-Cola Co reported global sales volumes below expectations. The stock was down 3.8 percent at $37.46, weighing on the Dow. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.44 points or 0.01 percent, to 16,155.83, the S&P; 500 gained 3.69 points or 0.2 percent, to 1,842.32 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 29.485 points or 0.69 percent, to 4,273.511. Shares of BlackBerry Ltd  jumped 5.3 percent to $9.45. Dan Loeb’s Third Point LLC Hedge fund disclosed a 10-million-share stake in the Canadian telecommunication and wireless equipment company. Swedish mobile phone game maker King, best known for the hit puzzle Candy Crush Saga, said it planned to raise up to $500 million in an initial public offering.

393,KO,Nespresso takes aim at Green Mountain's Keurig with big-cup brewer,"BOCA RATON, Florida (Reuters) - Nespresso is launching a new single-serve coffee brewer that makes larger American-sized portions, putting its Swiss parent Nestle NESN.VX in direct competition with U.S. market leader Green Mountain Coffee Roasters GMCR.O. Nestle, the world’s largest food company, said on Wednesday its new VertuoLine system will go on sale in the United States and Canada this week. It will make larger cups of coffee as well as the smaller espressos, popular in Europe, for which the brand is already known. The $8 billion global single-serve coffee market is one of the fastest-growing areas of an otherwise tepid packaged-food industry. Nestle has about 35 percent of the market globally, but its presence in the United States is dwarfed by Green Mountain’s Keurig system, which controls more than three quarters of the market. “We’ll watch it like we watch all of them,” Green Mountain Chief Executive Brian Kelley told Reuters at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York (CAGNY) conference in Boca Raton, Florida. Other rival brewers include the MyCafe from Bunn, the Tassimo from Kraft Foods Group KRFT.O and Starbucks Corp’s (SBUX.O) Verismo. Green Mountain is planning new machines as well. This fall, it will launch Keurig 2.0, which uses both single-serve “K-Cups” and larger-sized “K-Carafe” packs that brew 28 ounces of coffee. “We want a brewer on every counter and we want a beverage for every occasion of the day,” said Kelley, who added that only 20 percent of people in the United States have a single-cup coffee maker. Keurig personal brewers range in price from about $100 to $180. The list price for Nespresso’s basic VertuoLine will be $299 and a version with a milk frother will cost $349. TreeHouse Foods Inc (THS.N) earlier this month sued Green Mountain, alleging it attempted to illegally maintain a monopoly over the pods used in its new Keurig coffee brewers due to be released later this year. TreeHouse and several other companies have made and sold pods for Keurig machines since some patents expired in 2012. “We think (the lawsuit) is without merit,” Kelley told Reuters. Separately, Green Mountain plans to launch a machine later this year that makes cold beverages, and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) has signed on as its first partner. The world’s largest soda seller bought a 10 percent stake in Green Mountain for $1.3 billion. Shares in Green Mountain were off 2.2 percent to $117.71 on the Nasdaq. Nestle stock was flat at 65.75 Swiss francs. ",2192014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-nespresso-brewer/nespresso-takes-aim-at-green-mountains-keurig-with-big-cup-brewer-idUSBREA1I1YK20140219
394,KO,UPDATE 1-Coca-Cola CFO Fayard to retire,"Feb 20 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co said on Thursday that Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard would retire in May, and it named Kathy Waller, controller, to succeed him as CFO. Fayard, 62, has been CFO for about 15 years. Waller, 55, joined Coke in 1987 from Deloitte. “Gary’s a great guy, he’s been a great CFO. He doesn’t just know the numbers, he can describe the company’s strategy as well as an operating guy,” said Kevin Dryer, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds LLC. The announcement from the world’s biggest soda company came hours after rival PepsiCo was hit with a renewed push from billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz to split its challenged North American beverage business from its more robust snacks operation. Coke and PepsiCo are grappling with declining soda sales in the United States, as increasingly health-conscious consumers opt for alternatives like bottled water and tea. Coca-Cola’s chief executive, Muhtar Kent, is scheduled to speak at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference in Boca Raton, Florida, on Friday. Some conference attendees expect Kent to discuss Coke’s plans to refranchise some of its bottling operations following the 2010 acquisition of its North American bottler, which was aimed at cutting costs, speeding innovation and turning around a sagging market. PepsiCo did a similar deal. While Coke and Pepsi have traditionally moved together on major initiatives, they are currently out of step. Coke has been open about its plan to ultimately franchise its North American bottler, while PepsiCo has not. PepsiCo says it has carefully weighed a variety of corporate changes, ranging from a spin-off of North American beverages to the sale of some bottling operations. It has said that its current structure was best for shareholders since the interplay between North American snacks and beverages benefit its overall business. Coke’s shares closed up 0.5 percent at $37.30 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

397,KO,Peltz revives bid to split PepsiCo,"Feb 20 (Reuters) - Nelson Peltz has resumed his call to break up PepsiCo Inc less than a week after the maker of Pepsi-Cola and  Lay’s potato chips said it would not spin off its North-American beverage business. The snack and drink giant confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that Peltz’s Trian Fund Management LP sent a 37-page letter to its board of directors on Wednesday. Peltz has been urging PepsiCo to spin off the beverage  business and focus on its billion-dollar snack brands Lays, Cheetos and Doritos. PepsiCo, like rival Coca-Cola Co, has been battling  declining soda sales in developed markets, especially the United States, as health-conscious consumers reach for non-carbonated beverages such as juices and health drinks. Wednesday’s letter outlined why Trian still thinks PepsiCo should spin off its beverage business, the Journal reported. () “PepsiCo’s management and board of directors have spoken clearly on this issue and are fully aligned with our strategy outlined last week,” a PepsiCo spokesman said in an email to Reuters. Trian, which says it owns about $1.2 billion in PepsiCo stock, also informed the company that it will begin meeting with shareholders “immediately” and might conduct public shareholder forums as it tries to galvanize investor support for a split, the newspaper reported. Trian was not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours. PepsiCo, in its response to Trian’s letter, said, “Our focus is on delivering results for our shareholders, not new, costly distractions that will harm shareholder interests.” Peltz had also urged PepsiCo to create a snack food giant by acquiring Oreo cookie maker Mondelez International, but dropped that push after winning a seat on the Mondelez board last month. Last week, after reporting a better-than-expected profit, PepsiCo’s Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said, “Decoupling our beverage and snack businesses in North America would significantly reduce our relevance to our customers.” The company had said its decision not to spin off the business was taken after an exhaustive review that involved external consultants and bankers. “We are confident in our ability to deliver long-term shareholder value as an integrated food and beverage company,” PepsiCo said on Wednesday.",2202014,http://www.reuters.com/article/peltz-pepsico/peltz-revives-bid-to-split-pepsico-idUSL3N0LP1TT20140220
398,KO,Fitch Affirms Coca-Cola's IDRs at 'A+/F1'; Outlook Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default  Ratings (IDRs) and the debt ratings of The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its  subsidiaries as follows: The Coca-Cola Company --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; --Bank credit facilities at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper (CP) at 'F1'.  Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (CCR) --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; --Senior shelf at 'A+'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Negative from Stable. Coca-Cola had  approximately $37.1 billion of debt as of Dec. 31, 2013. The Rating Outlook revision to Negative is due to Fitch's concern with  Coca-Cola's high gross leverage that has been elevated by substantial commercial  paper (CP) balances. Coca-Cola's gross leverage is weak for the rating category  at 2.8x on a total debt-to-operating EBITDA basis at the end of 2013, up from  2.4x a year ago. Coca-Cola's CP balance remains substantial at $16.9 billion at  the end of 2013, a slight increase of $700 million in the past year. This  compares to $12.9 billion in 2011. The growth in CP balances results from Coca-Cola's mismatch between its U.S.  cash outflows and its significant international cash inflows which the company  has not felt a need to repatriate at this time. Coca-Cola maintains a comparable  cash balance along with its committed bank lines to provide backup to its CP  borrowings. At the end of 2013, Coca-Cola's liquidity position of $26.6 billion  consisted of $17.1 billion of cash, $3.1 billion of short-term investments, and  $6.4 billion of availability under its committed credit lines and revolving  credit facility. Fitch views the significant cash balances that back Coca-Cola's CP program and  lower its net leverage to 1.26x as a key mitigating factor. However, the vast  majority of the company's cash is offshore, making it costly to repatriate if  necessary. Additionally, the CP mix is slightly less than 50% of the firm's  overall capital structure which Fitch believes increases Coca-Cola's financial  risk. Despite the company's good liquidity and on-going market access, the higher  sustained levels of CP and the uncertainty of when Coca-Cola could use cash to  reduce CP balances remain a concern. Coca-Cola has indicated that $20 billion is  the upper limit for its CP program. Fitch believes Coca-Cola should advance a  longer-term definitive plan to address its large CP balance with any reduction  in cash matching any corresponding reduction in CP levels resulting in lower  gross debt. Following its late 2013 refinancing, nearer-term debt maturities in  2014 were reduced. Coca-Cola also used a portion of the proceeds to term-out CP  as CP balances at the end of the third quarter 2013 had risen to $18.8 billion.  Coca-Cola's long-term debt maturities include $1 billion coming due in 2014 and  $3.5 billion maturing in 2015. KEY RATING DRIVERS Coca-Cola ratings are supported by its position as the world's largest global  beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has 17 $1  billion brands, including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute Maid,  and Dasani. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's  beverage portfolio, the ratings consider the multiyear decline in CSD volumes in  the U.S., growing scrutiny over artificial sweeteners and modest CSD growth in  other developed countries. However, this risk is mitigated by Coca-Cola's market  strength in developing, higher-growth geographies with low per capita  consumption characteristics that should provide an important longer-term offset. Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to consistently generate  considerable cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash flow (FCF). For  2013, Coca-Cola generated $10.5 billion and $3 billion (after adjusting for  dividends) of CFFO and FCF, respectively, after generating $10.6 billion and  $3.3 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012.  Coca-Cola has committed to $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net share repurchases  in 2014, after repurchasing a net $3.5 billion in 2013. Fitch expects  Coca-Cola's FCF in 2014 to be at least in the $3.5 billion range driven in part  by reduced pension contributions. Coca-Cola has demonstrated good execution and resiliency in the past with  top-line and cash flow growth driven by increasing volume, price/mix and  improved operating expense leverage. Persistent global macroeconomic pressure,  higher taxes, negative perceptions of artificial sweeteners and weather-related  issues made volume growth more challenging during 2013. Coca-Cola reported that  global volume grew 2%, below the lower end of its long-term financial targets of  3%-4% for worldwide volume growth. Reported revenue and operating income grew 3%  and 6%, respectively, when excluding the impact of structural changes, which is  at the low end of its 6%-8% target for operating income growth. As such, the  global economic recovery remains challenging, negatively affecting consumer  spending, with pockets of volatility across emerging market regions. Reflecting  these challenges, Coca-Cola announced an incremental $1 billion productivity  savings by 2016 that will be primarily redirected for increased media  investments to support the brand, which Fitch views favorably. Ratings also consider the potential for future acquisitions given the company's  transaction history. Coca-Cola has material flexibility to engage in smaller  acquisitions through its cash balances and free cash generation. Fitch views the  new 10-year agreement with Green Coffee Mountain Roaster's for $1.25 billion as  a positive for Coca-Cola's operating profile. The shifting secular trends within  the soft drink industry make this investment essential to create an additional  avenue for growth. This provides a defensive position against at-home  competitive threats and enables opportunities for new consumption occasions  across an emerging distribution channel.  Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola  Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations, since default risk is very low  at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to the  notes issued by Coca-Cola. RATINGS SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead Fitch  to affirm the ratings with a Stable Outlook include:  --Coca-Cola develops a definitive plan to reduce CP balances and gross debt.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: --If Coca-Cola's ratings are negatively affected by a large debt-financed  acquisition or share repurchase program, a reduction in cash and cash  equivalents without a commensurate reduction in CP balances, and/or the lack of  a plan to reduce gross leverage over the longer term.  In addition, further negative pressure from increased declines with CSD volumes  in the U.S., greater than expected volatility in emerging market regions,  aggressive excise taxes increases in multiple regions, shift in focus from  pricing to volume, and margin erosion from channel mix shifts could also affect  ratings. Fitch currently rates Coca-Cola as follows: The Coca-Cola Company --Long-term IDR 'A+'; --Bank credit facilities 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --CP 'F1'. Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (CCR) --Long-term IDR 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

403,KO,RPT-Saudi Aujan Coca-Cola plans $100 mln fruit-juice factory in Egypt,"By Mirna Sleiman DUBAI, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Aujan Coca-Cola Beverages Company plans to spend $100 million building a fruit-juice factory in Egypt over the next few years, a senior executive said on Monday, despite the challenges there after three years of political turmoil. Meshal Alkadeeb, vice president of strategy and business development, said the money would cover buying the land and setting up the factory in Egypt, which Aujun sees as a North Africa hub, mainly for Algeria and Libya. “The plant will be commissioned between 2016 and 2017. We just started working on it,” Alkadeeb said. Egypt’s army-backed government is trying to attract foreign money back into the country and create jobs to ease social discontent as it manages the biggest Arab nation’s difficult transition to elections this year. Having spent more than $100 million in the food and beverage sector across the Middle East, mainly in Dubai and Dammam, and having agreed to buy a majority stake in Lebanon’s National Beverage Company, Aujun - half-owned by Coca-Cola Co - sees the time as ripe, Alkadeeb said. “Right now, the biggest challenge for investing in Egypt would be infrastructure.

405,KO,"UPDATE 3-Mexico's Coke Femsa's sales rise, profit drops on acquisitions","MEXICO CITY, Feb 26 (Reuters) - A string of recent acquisitions helped to boost fourth-quarter sales volumes at Coca-Cola Femsa, Latin America’s biggest Coke bottler, but the cost of financing the deals led to a 29 percent drop in earnings. Shares of the joint venture of Coca-Cola Co and Mexican retailer Femsa fell nearly 4 percent after it reported results on Wednesday. Without revenue from the newly acquired businesses, sales dipped because of weak consumer spending in Brazil and Mexico and poor weather, Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino told analysts on a conference call. To pare down debt, he said, the company will trim its investment this year to between $600 million and $700 million from roughly $800 million in 2013. Projects slated for this year include work on new plants to expand production in Colombia and Brazil. The company reported a profit of 3.066 billion pesos ($234 million) for the quarter, down from 4.320 billion pesos a year earlier. Financing expenses more than tripled to 1.9 billion pesos from 611 million pesos as net debt increased more than six times to 45.2 billion pesos. Most of the debt increase was to fund acquisitions in Brazil, Coke Femsa said. A decline in the value of the peso against the U.S. dollar also drove up financing costs, since about one-fifth of the company’s debt is in dollars. “We want to reduce our debt,” Trevino said on the call, explaining it was important for the company to maintain its credit ratings so it could continue to place new debt easily. Coke Femsa has been on a buying spree. Last year it acquired bottlers in Mexico, the Philippines and Brazil. Coca-Cola Co has been selling some bottling operations in the United States. Trevino said Coke Femsa might be interested in such deals in the future, but its focus for now is in Latin America and the Philippines. The recent acquisitions helped Coke Femsa report an 8.5 percent jump in revenue to 43.24 billion pesos and higher sales volumes for Coke, bottled water and juices. But excluding the new revenue from the acquisitions in Brazil and Mexico, sales volumes slipped 1.1 percent. Coke Femsa expects sales volumes in Mexico to drop between 5 and 7 percent this year as a result of a tax of 1 peso (8 cents) per liter on sugary drinks implemented last year. The company has increased prices by 16 percent to include the tax and may raise them again in the middle of this year, Trevino said. Shares of Coke Femsa were down 3.7 percent at 126.10 pesos in afternoon trading.",2262014,http://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-cokefemsa/update-3-mexicos-coke-femsas-sales-rise-profit-drops-on-acquisitions-idUSL1N0LV10J20140226

407,KO,UPDATE 2-Mexico's Femsa 4th-qtr profit halves on financial costs,"By Christine Murray MEXICO CITY, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Mexico’s Femsa  said on Thursday fourth-quarter profit halved from strong year-ago levels due to higher financial costs at its bottling joint venture co-owned by Coca-Cola Co. The bottler and convenience store retailer said profit fell 48 percent to 4.99 billion pesos ($381 million) in the three months to end-December, from 9.66 billion pesos a year earlier. This was largely due to a large one-off gain it made from its stake in Dutch brewer Heineken a year earlier, but also the cost of financing a string of acquisitions, mostly in Brazil, at its Coca-Cola Femsa joint venture. Femsa’s financial expenditures almost tripled from 853 million pesos to 2.46 billion pesos. Shares at Coke Femsa, which is co-owned with U.S. beverage group Coca-Cola Co, are down more than 40 percent from an all-time high in April after weak consumer spending in Brazil coincided with a new sugary drinks levy in Mexico designed to curb rising obesity. At the group level, revenue rose 11 percent to 70.5 billion pesos, driven by strong sales at convenience store division Femsa Comercio. Despite slumping consumer confidence and retail sales in  No.1 market Mexico, the division which runs convenience stores under its Oxxo brand opened 511 new stores in the quarter and total sales increased 13.5 percent from the year-earlier quarter. Chief Financial Officer Javier Astaburuaga told analysts on a call that he expected to open more than 1000 new stores in 2014. He added that same-store sales would trend toward the mid single-digit range so long as the economic environment improves as the year progresses. Mexico’s economy slowed sharply in the fourth quarter as industry ground to a halt and the pace of services growth dropped. Retail sales in Mexico saw their fastest drop in a year in December. Astaburuaga said total capital expenditure at the group level could reach $1.35 billion this year, with $850 million going to Coca-Cola Femsa. Shares in Monterrey-based Femsa rose 2.07 percent by 1215 EST to 115.22 pesos per share.",2272014,http://www.reuters.com/article/mexico-femsa/update-2-mexicos-femsa-4th-qtr-profit-halves-on-financial-costs-idUSL1N0LW17X20140227

409,KO,PepsiCo re-enters 'Magic Kingdom' with Shanghai Disney deal,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc PEP.N has signed a deal to supply beverages to Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) first China resort, breaking The Coca-Cola Co’s (KO.N) quarter century monopoly over beverage supply to the U.S. theme park operator. PepsiCo and its partner in China, Tingyi Cayman Islands Holding Corp (0322.HK), will exclusively provide beverages to the Shanghai Disney Resort, its first on mainland China which is set to open at the end of 2015, PepsiCo, Disney and Tingyi said in a joint statement on Thursday. Coca-Cola has had a long-standing tie-up with Disney, while it has been at least 25 years since PepsiCo last sold its beverages through the theme park chain, a Dubai-based PepsiCo spokesman said. The deal is only a tiny segment of China’s 421 billion yuan ($68.74 billion) soft drink sector, but marks a blow for PepsiCo against Coke in the highly competitive market, where both brands are coming under increasing pressure from Chinese rivals and changing consumer tastes for local flavors. “I wonder what kind of message it sends to Coke globally. Even though the Disney park is only one small thing, China has massive room to grow for the Disney brand. Tying up this deal could mean good things going forward,” said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group. Disney said it currently has no plans to ink similar deals with PepsiCo to supply its other resorts, although it is “actively pursuing opportunities in a variety of different sectors,” Murray King, vice president of public affairs for the Shanghai Disney Resort, said. The PepsiCo spokesman said he could not comment on whether PepsiCo and Disney planned other tie-ups. Disney has a further 11 theme parks and 44 resorts around the world, according to its official website. Coca-Cola edges the China market with a 15.7 percent share of China’s soft drinks market in 2012, ahead of PepsiCo’s 4.5 percent share by off-trade volume, according to data from Euromonitor. China’s soft drinks sector is worth around 421 billion yuan ($69.12 billion). Chinese consumers are increasingly opting for healthier alternatives in food and drink, which has also hit growth for fast food chains such as McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N). Coca-Cola remains the soft drinks supplier for Disney resorts outside mainland China. It is the beverage provider for Disney’s 11 parks in the United States, Hong Kong, France and Japan, a Singapore-based spokeswoman for Coca-Cola said. “The Coca-Cola Company and The Walt Disney Company share a long-standing partnership that dates to the first Disney television show in 1950 and the first Disneyland theme park in 1955. Today, our global partnership with Disney is as strong as ever,” she added in emailed comments to Reuters. Though it retains the biggest market share in China, but local rivals are catching up. Pepsi’s partner in the market, Taiwanese Tingyi, raised its market share from 9.9 percent in 2007 to 12.8 percent in 2012, according to Euromonitor. Tingyi and PepsiCo beverages will be the sole range of drinks sold at the Shanghai park, a Tingyi spokesman said. All three companies declined to put a value on the deal. The key question for Pepsi is if it can leverage its tie-up with Disney outside the limits of the resort, said Cavender. “If they can do more Disney-themed adverts elsewhere I can see this benefiting them a lot, and the fact Disney switched from Coke to Pepsi here could mean big things for the years ahead in other markets too,” he said.

411,KO,UPDATE 1-Most investors in survey back Pepsi split; Buffett opposes,"By Lisa Baertlein LOS ANGELES, March 3 (Reuters) - Investor Warren Buffett and some Wall Street fund managers are divided on activist Nelson Peltz’s renewed proposal to split PepsiCo Inc’s robust snacks division from its beverage business. The packaged food and beverage industry has been dogged by lackluster demand, leading growth-seeking activist investors to demand spinoffs and deep cost cuts to “unlock” value. A majority of institutional investors, including Pepsi shareholders, support a split, according to a Wall Street survey conducted by Bernstein Research and released on Monday. Peltz, who was instrumental in carving up food companies such as Cadbury and Kraft, has had Pepsi in his sights on and off since July. Other activist investors are seeking to break up Darden Restaurants Inc, the corporate parent of the Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurant chains. “If I was the only holder of it, or if my family was the only holder of it, I don’t think I would split it up,” Buffett told CNBC, the cable business channel, on Monday. Pepsi’s Frito-Lay North America business includes snack brands such as Lay’s, Doritos and Cheetos. It booked 2013 net revenue of $14.1 billion, accounting for about 21 percent of the company’s total net revenue last year. PepsiCo Americas Beverages had 2013 net revenue of $21.1 billion, or roughly 32 percent of the total. “I think that Frito-Lay is an extremely good business. It’s a better business than the soft drink business, but I think the soft drink business is a good business too, and I don’t see any reason to split them up,” said Buffett, chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BREAKINGVIEWS-Inverses Buffett and Icahn correlate many ways too ) PepsiCo, like rival Coca-Cola Co, has struggled with declining sales in developed countries, especially the United States, as health-conscious consumers switch to non-carbonated beverages such as water, juices and health drinks. Pepsi executives repeatedly have defended the current structure of the company, with CEO Indra Nooyi saying a split would hurt its ability to negotiate with retail customers. Other institutional investors disagree with Pepsi and with Buffett. The majority, 55 percent, surveyed by Bernstein, said Pepsi should be broken up. They cited greater focus as a potential benefit and the loss of synergies between the snacks and beverage businesses as a risk. At the same time, the same percentage of investors did not believe such a change would happen in the next one to two years, according to the survey. Those surveyed “have done detailed work on this debate already, and hold a generally pessimistic view regarding company management,” Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj wrote in a client note.

Its sales rose 113 percent to 9.2 billion lira in 2013, although its beer sales volume fell to 7.4 million hectoliters from 8.6 mhl, due to contraction in Turkish and Russian markets. Calculated with the consolidation of Coca Cola sales, 2012 sales of the group would be 8.9 billion lira in 2012. Anadoldu Efes expects beer sales volume to drop by low-single-digits in 2014, but sees higher revenues due to price hikes, said Chief Executive Officer Damien Gammell.

414,KO,Pepsi says will try to make sure suppliers uphold land rights,"* Pepsi pledge follows similar action by Coca-Cola * Oxfam campaigning directed at top 10 food and drink firms * Land rights are sensitive subject in sugar-grower Brazil * Pepsi ranked 4th in Oxfam survey of responsible brands March 18 (Reuters) - PepsiCo, the world’s No. 3 food and beverage company, committed on Tuesday to take steps to stop illegal land seizures by suppliers of raw materials such as sugar and palm oil as it tries to improve social and environmental standards. The pledge follows a similar commitment by Coca-Cola  last year and comes in response to a campaign by development group Oxfam that is pushing top food and drink companies to improve ethical standards among suppliers in poor countries. The industry has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years over sourcing of raw materials, attracting criticism on issues ranging from child labour on cocoa farms to the impact of palm oil plantations on rain forests. PepsiCo said in a statement it had worked with Oxfam and other external experts on a new policy to prevent suppliers displacing any legitimate landowners. As demanded by Oxfam, PepsiCo also gave details about the amount of soy, palm oil and cane sugar it buys and the main countries that it sources those raw ingredients from, including Brazil, Malaysia, Indonesia, Mexico, India and Thailand. “These supply chains are incredibly opaque. The companies themselves don’t even know where the sugar is coming from. It forces them to ask where their suppliers are getting it from,” Chris Jochnick, director of Oxfam’s private sector work, said. Oxfam said PepsiCo would audit its top sugar supplier Brazil in 2014, followed by Mexico, Thailand and the Philippines by the end of 2016, with a particular focus on making sure local communities give consent before their land is sold for farming. PepsiCo also pledged to source all of its cane sugar from sources certified as sustainable by 2020 and said it would work with suppliers in Brazil and Thailand to that end. Native land rights are a sensitive subject in Brazil and tensions between farmers and Indians have run high since the government evicted 7,000 farmers and their families from an Indian territory last year, starting violent protests. Oxfam has ranked the top 10 food and drink companies according to their policies on issues it deems as critical to sustainable agriculture: the rights of women, small-scale farmers and farm workers, as well as water, land, climate change and transparency. PepsiCo came joint fourth with Mondelez International  in the latest ranking, behind Nestle, Unilever and Coca-Cola, while General Mills  replaced Associated British Foods in last place. (www.oxfam.org/behindthebrands) Jochnick said PepsiCo’s commitments would help boost its scores for ethical behaviour on land and transparency issues, and Oxfam would follow up to make sure it implements changes.",3182014,http://www.reuters.com/article/pepsico-sugar/pepsi-says-will-try-to-make-sure-suppliers-uphold-land-rights-idUSL6N0MF2KO20140318

417,KO,Coke and investor spar over 2014 compensation plan,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Wintergreen Advisers, which says it owns more than 2.5 million shares of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) on behalf of clients, on Thursday intensified its critique of the proposed 2014 equity compensation plan of the world’s biggest soda maker. David Winters, the chief executive officer of Wintergreen, outlined his concerns with the compensation plan late last month in letters to Coca-Cola’s directors and investors, including Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), which is Coca-Cola’s largest shareholder. In those letters, Winters characterized the plan as “an unnecessarily large transfer of wealth from Coca-Cola’s shareholders to members of the company’s management team.” He is urging the company’s board to yank the plan and replace it with a different one. On Thursday, Winters took his argument to CNBC, saying that the company’s stock-buyback program aimed at improving investor returns “has been hijacked by the company.” Coca-Cola said on Thursday that the proposed equity compensation plan is not just for senior management. About 6,400 employees participate in the plan globally. Winters “continues to overstate the dilutive impact of the plan,” Coca-Cola said in an emailed statement. The skirmish comes after Coca-Cola reported 2013 volume and revenue that fell short of internal expectations. U.S. soda sales fell for the ninth straight year in 2013. At the heart of the dispute is a compensation plan that would include 500 million shares, including stock options and performance share units. Stock options would account for 300 million of those shares and 40 million would be so-called performance share units, or PSUs, which are only awarded if certain profit and other financial goals are met. Each PSU would count as five shares under the plan. Winters said that the new plan, when combined with equity awards from existing plans, could result in dilution of 14.2 percent or more. On Thursday, he told CNBC that Coca-Cola also moved its performance targets down. Winters has dubbed the plan “grossly outsized for a company with earnings growth in the single digits” and “a bad precedent for corporate America.” In its proxy filed in early March, Coca-Cola disclosed that the plan’s potential dilution could be 14.2 percent if performance targets were met and all awards were earned. In that filing, Coca-Cola also said that the decrease in its targets for the 2012 through 2014 PSU award and the 2013 through 2015 PSU award was due to the projected negative impact of currency exchange and the expectation of a more challenging macroeconomic environment over the three-year performance periods. “If the company does not perform, no compensation is realized,” Coca-Cola said in its statement. All PSUs for the 2011 through 2013 period were forfeited because the company did not meet its targets and PSUs for 2012 through 2014 are not on track to be paid out, Coca-Cola said. “Actual dilution related to existing equity plans over the last three years has been less than 1 percent per year and is expected to be in this range going forward,” the company said.

419,KO,Exclusive: Kuwaiti family exploring sale of Americana food group -sources,"LONDON (Reuters) - Kuwait’s billionaire al-Kharafi family is looking to sell Americana, one of the Middle East’s largest food companies, and has hired bankers to explore a deal, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. There is no formal process underway, the sources said, but the family is working with investment bank Rothschild to approach potential buyers including private equity groups and sovereign wealth funds in the region to explore their interest in the $3.6 billion group. According to Thomson Reuters data, the Kharafi family holds 66.8 percent of Kuwait Food Company FOOD.KW, which sells goods under the brand name Americana, through its private investment company MAK (Mohammed Abdulmohsin al-Kharafi & Sons). Rothschild declined to comment. Americana and MAK were not immediately available for comment. Founded in 1964 in Kuwait, Americana is a publicly traded group of companies based in the Middle East and North Africa, with interests in restaurants and packaged food. It trades on the Kuwait stock exchange and its $3.63 billion market capitalization makes it the biggest company on the Thomson Reuters MENA Cyclical Consumer Goods and Services Index. The group had sales of $3.1 billion dollars in 2013 and profits of $179 million, according to its website. The company is a franchise operator of restaurants including KFC and Pizza Hut, owned by Yum Brands (YUM.N), and Red Lobster and Olive Garden, owned by Darden Restaurants (DRI.N). Americana also manufactures California Garden beans and Farm Frites frozen vegetables. The Middle East is seen as an attractive region for food and drink companies, thanks to a growing and youthful population and a drive to reduce the economic dependence on oil and gas. In 2009, Americana sold its stake in a joint venture called Cairo Food Industries to its partner, H.J. Heinz, which is now owned by Brazilian private equity firm 3G. PepsiCo PEP.N has a joint venture with Saudi Arabian dairy company Almarai, while Coca-Cola (KO.N) bought half of the Saudi Arabian beverage business owned by Aujan Industries in 2012, pledging to invest $5 billion in the region over the next decade. The sources said it was not clear whether the business might be sold in part or as a whole. The Kharafi family, one of the most influential in the Gulf Arab region, have holdings across various sectors including construction, financials and telecoms through MAK.

The Nasdaq slid more than 1 percent, weighed down by another downturn in momentum names. In recent weeks, momentum names - stocks seen by investors as having high growth potential - have been under pressure after a meteoric rise in their prices took valuations to levels that appeared to be unsustainable. Tesla Motors Inc fell 5.5 percent to $187.25 and NetFlix Inc dropped 4.5 percent to $316.82 to rank among the worst performers in the Nasdaq 100 index. The Global X Social Media index, whose components include Facebook, LinkedIn and Yelp,  fell 2.7 percent. The exchange-traded fund, designed to measure the performance of companies in the social media industry, has dropped nearly 22 percent since the end of February. The Nasdaq Biotech index dropped 2.8 percent. The index, whose components include Alexion Pharmaceuticals and Biogen Idex, has lost more than 20 percent over the past six weeks. Those losses put both indexes in bear market territory, which Wall Street defines as a drop of 20 percent from a peak. “They reached a level where the pricing was absurd in terms of the valuation of these companies, and for whatever reason, the market has woken up to the fact and is now correcting to get them back down to a reasonable valuation,” said Stephen Massocca, managing director of Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. “And suddenly everyone realizes the emperor has no clothes.” Coca-Cola Co shot up 3.3 percent to $40.01 and gave the biggest boost to the S&P; 500 after the U.S. soft drink maker reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue. Strong sales in China more than offset a drop in Europe and flat volumes in North America, Coca-Cola said. Fellow Dow component Johnson & Johnson rose 1.1 percent to $98.24 after the company posted quarterly earnings well above Wall Street’s expectations. Brisk sales of new prescription drugs balanced weak sales of consumer products, according to J&J;, which slightly raised its full-year profit view. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 63.90 points or 0.40 percent, to 16,109.34. The S&P; 500 lost 9.89 points or 0.54 percent, to 1,820.72. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 63.648 points or 1.58 percent, to 3,959.046. Economic data continued to point to a sluggish recovery. A gauge of manufacturing in New York state grew at a much slower rate in April than it did in March, coming in far below expectations. The U.S. Consumer Price Index increased 0.2 percent in March, although inflation pressures remained generally benign. The National Association of Home Builders said homebuilder sentiment edged up in April but remained mostly dour on lingering concerns about stiff credit conditions for buyers and tight supply of building lots and labor. S&P; 500 companies’ first-quarter earnings are projected to have increased just 1 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent. Investors will be looking at the impact of harsh winter weather on first-quarter earnings and watching for signs of corporate optimism about the second quarter. Aaron’s Inc shares slumped 5.1 percent to $28.93 after the rent-to-own furniture and electronics retailer said it had rejected a $2.3 billion takeover offer from a major shareholder and instead acquired a retail credit financing firm for about $700 million.

427,KO,Coca-Cola sales beat estimates as China volumes soar,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue as it ramped up spending on marketing and advertising, boosting sales in emerging markets such as China. Coca-Cola, like PepsiCo Inc, has been battling falling soda sales in developed markets such as the United States as people shift to healthier options such as juices. To help revive soda sales, Coke will embark on its biggest promotional program in history for the soccer World Cup, Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard told Reuters. Coca-Cola is one of the key sponsors of the event, which kicks off in June in Brazil. The company’s shares rose 4 percent, bringing them back to where they were about a year ago. Coke said in February it expected to save $1 billion annually through productivity improvements by 2016, and would redirect much of the savings into increased advertising and marketing. “We’re beginning to get our momentum back ... ,” Chief Executive Muhtar Kent said on CNBC on Tuesday. Global case volumes rose 2 percent in the quarter, while those in China rose 12 percent due to increased marketing around the Chinese New Year, the company said on Tuesday. Coke does not break out China sales separately. The business falls under its Asia-Pacific region, the company’s second-biggest market by revenue. In 2013, the region accounted for 13 percent of overall sales. The company plans to invest $8 billion in China over the five years through 2017 as it focuses on emerging markets to boost revenue. Quarterly sales volumes rose 6 percent in both India and Russia and 4 percent in Brazil. Sales in North America, the company’s biggest market, were stable despite an unusually cold winter and the general consumer shift away from fizzy drinks. European sales fell 4 percent. “Our North America Group delivered even volume versus the prior year quarter while gaining value share and maintaining volume share,” the company said in a statement. U.S. soda sales in 2013 were the lowest since 1995 with total sales volumes declining 3 percent, according to a report by industry newsletter Beverage Digest in March. Kent has been trying to boost profits by cutting costs, developing its non-soda brands and getting into new businesses. The company bought a 10 percent stake in single-cup coffee brewer Keurig Green Mountain Inc - known for its K-cups - in February to help compete in the home soda-making market, dominated by Israel-based Sodastream International Ltd. The partnership is looking to develop machines to dispense cold drinks such as juices and teas. Coke owns the Minute Maid juice brand and Honest Tea. RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said Coke’s global volume growth was “particularly impressive” in a quarter marked by harsh weather, a strong dollar and the effects of tensions between Russia and United States. “From here, we believe volumes will continue to accelerate ...,” Modi wrote in the note. However, the company was cautious, saying unfavorable currency rates - notably the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar - would create a “7 percent headwind” for both second-quarter and 2014 results. The company’s net income attributable to shareholders fell to $1.62 billion, or 36 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 28 from $1.75 billion, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 44 cents per share, matching the average analyst estimate. Revenue fell 4 percent to $10.58 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $10.55 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Not all shareholders were happy on Tuesday. Wintergreen Advisers LLC, which says it owns more than 2.5 million Coke shares, released a letter to top shareholders urging them to review Coke’s equity compensation plan before the annual meeting on April 23. Wintergreen Chief Executive David Winters called the equity plan “deeply flawed” and said Coke may need to spend $2 billion per year to offset the dilution caused by the plan. Winters has previously said the plan, when combined with existing equity awards, could dilute shareholders’ interests by more than 14.2 percent. Coca-Cola shares were trading at $40.06 at 1:06 PM ET.

433,KO,Small is beautiful for Coca-Cola as volumes soar in China,"(Reuters) - Strong sales volume growth in China helped The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) beat quarterly revenue estimates as lower-priced, smaller soda bottles and juices attracted more price and health-conscious shoppers in the world’s second largest economy. Case volumes in China rose 12 percent in the first quarter of the year, boosted by marketing campaigns around the key Chinese New Year holiday shopping period, helping drive a global two percent rise in volumes. Brazil, India and Russia also saw strong volume sales growth. Coca-Cola, like rival PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, has been battling falling soda sales in developed markets such as the United States, where its soda sales last year were the lowest since 1995. Analysts said a focus on smaller, lower priced products in China was helping target consumers in fast-growing, smaller cities, where demand is outstripping larger urban centers. “Our newly architected packaging portfolio in China is really working with the smaller packs and the new price points,” Coca-Cola Chairman and CEO Muhtar Kent said on an earnings call after the results. A greater focus on health among Chinese consumers also increased sales volumes of the Coca-Cola’s Minute Maid Pulpy juice drink brand by 8 percent in the period. Analysts cautioned the strong China results were partly due to weak growth in the first quarter of last year, when volumes were up just one percent due to a slowing economy and rising competition from local rivals. Some Chinese consumers said the smaller sizes were cute as well as convenient. “The mini Coca-Cola is adorable, I love the small packaging,” said a microblogger on China’s Twitter-like Sina Weibo site. Coca-Cola does not break out China sales separately. The business falls under its Asia-Pacific region, the company’s second-biggest market by revenue, which accounted for 13 percent of overall sales in 2013. Coca-Cola is looking to leverage this year’s soccer World Cup in Brazil, where it is a key sponsor, to help revive soda sales which fell one percent globally for the quarter. Its soda brands include Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta. A World Cup-linked campaign has already helped the Brazilian and China markets, the firm said in a statement. Coca-Cola, which plans to invest $8 billion in China in the five years to 2017, accounted for 16 percent of the soft drinks market in 2012. The sector is worth an estimated 487.4 billion yuan ($78.33 billion) this year, according to consultants Euromonitor. The growth in China contrasts with flat sales in North America, the company’s biggest market, where an unusually cold winter and a shift away from fizzy drinks suppressed demand. European sales fell 4 percent. Coke said in February it is looking to cut costs by $1 billion annually through productivity improvements by 2016, and would redirect much of the savings into increased advertising and marketing. Coca-Cola has also been looking to diversify away from its soda business. The company bought a 10 percent stake this year in Keurig Green Mountain Inc GMCR.O - known for its K-cup coffees - to help compete in the home soda-making market, dominated by Israel-based Sodastream International Ltd (SODA.O). The partnership is looking to develop machines to dispense cold drinks such as juices and teas. Coke owns the Minute Maid juice and Honest Tea brands. RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said Coke’s global volume growth was “impressive” in a quarter marked by harsh weather, a strong dollar and the effects of tensions between Russia and United States. “From here, we believe volumes will continue to accelerate,” Modi wrote in an analyst note. However, Coca-Cola was cautious, saying unfavorable currency rates would create a seven percent “headwind” for both second-quarter and 2014 full-year results. The company’s net income attributable to shareholders fell eight percent to $1.62 billion, or 36 cents per share, from $1.75 billion a year earlier.

436,KO,U.S. top court asks if Coca-Cola juice label is misleading,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices grilled a lawyer for Coca-Cola Co on Monday, asking why a juice label touting the presence of pomegranates and blueberries should not be considered misleading if the drink contained just a trace of the fruits. Coca-Cola argued that it could not be sued over the labeling of one of its Minute Maid juice products because the label complies with rules of the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees some aspects of labeling for processed foods and drinks. POM Wonderful, which makes a product that is 100 percent pomegranate juice, had filed suit against Coca-Cola, claiming the Minute Maid juice label was misleading and would hurt sales for its own product. The Minute Maid juice is sold as a “Pomegranate Blueberry Flavored Blend of 5 Juices.” It is mostly apple and grape juice with just 0.3 percent pomegranate juice and 0.2 percent blueberry juice, according to a POM court filing. Attorney Kathleen Sullivan, who argued for Coca-Cola, said the company could not be sued by POM for being “misleading” under the Lanham Act, which is designed to protect trademarks. Chief Justice John Roberts appeared to disagree: “I don’t know why it’s impossible to have a label that fully complies with the FDA regulations and also happens to be misleading on the entirely different question of commercial competition, consumer confusion that has nothing to do with health.” Pomegranate and blueberries are popular with health-conscious Americans because they contain antioxidants that some believe prevent cancer and heart disease, although the science behind that belief is unclear. The question of whether the labeling is misleading drew sharp questions. Justice Anthony Kennedy said, “I think it’s relevant for us to ask whether people are cheated in buying this product.” Sullivan said consumers were sophisticated enough to know that when they see a food label containing the word “flavored” that other juices would be in the bottle. Justice Anthony Kennedy shot back: “Don’t make me feel bad because I thought that was pomegranate juice.” Kennedy also raised the question of “whether people are cheated in buying this product.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor agreed with Kennedy, saying: “You’re permitted to use this name under their (FDA) regulations. But why are you permitted to use it in a misleading way?” Sullivan took exception to the justices’ statements. “Coke’s label is as a matter of law not misleading,” she said. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, addressing a related issue, argued that the FDA has a huge job. “Labels for juices are not really high on its list. It has very limited resources. You are asking us to take what it has said about juice as blessing (on) this label,” she said. Kennedy agreed: “It is doubtful that FDA has sufficient resources to police food and beverage labeling.” In a parallel fight, the Federal Trade Commission has accused POM of making health claims for its juices that the company cannot substantiate.

438,KO,U.S. top court questions Coca-Cola over fruit juice label,"WASHINGTON, April 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices sharply questioned a lawyer for Coca-Cola on Monday, asking why a juice label touting pomegranate and blueberry should not be considered misleading if the drink contained only a tiny amount of the fruits. Officially, the case was about whether a competitor - in this case POM Wonderful - could challenge as misleading the label on a juice bottle sold by Coke’s Minute Maid brand if the Food and Drug Administration had not objected to it. The Minute Maid juice is sold as a “Pomegranate Blueberry Flavored Blend of 5 Juices” but is primarily apple and grape juice with 0.3 percent pomegranate juice and 0.2 percent blueberry juice, according to a POM court filing. POM Wonderful, which makes a juice that is 100 percent pomegranate juice, argued that the Minute Maid juice label was misleading and would hurt sales for its product.

Thus, she said, the company could not be sued by POM for being “misleading” under the Lanham Act, which is designed to protect trademarks.

439,KO,Buffett: moving oil by rail safely major industry concern,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett, chairman of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), said on Wednesday that safety is a major priority for the rail industry, after a recent spate of accidents raised concerns about how to transport oil safely. “I can tell you that’s all they’re thinking about,” the investor said in an interview with Reuters. “We’re going to move a lot of crude in this country, and we have to learn how to do it very safely,” he added. He added that the delay in the construction of the Keystone pipeline was unlikely to prompt additional purchases of tank cars at Berkshire railroad unit BNSF. Earlier this year the railroad said it plans to buy its own fleet of up to 5,000 new crude oil tank cars with safety features that exceed the latest industry standards. Oil by rail has surged in recent years, helped by a boom in North Dakota. Traffic is now running 10 percent ahead of last year at this time, with BNSF accounting for roughly a third of U.S. oil-by-rail traffic. But recent accidents have underscored the dangers of transporting the volatile fuel by train, with Canada now planning to phase out older tank cars to improve safety. COCA-COLA COMPENSATION PLAN Buffett also said, in an interview with CNBC the same day, that he thinks Coca-Cola’s (KO.N) equity compensation plan was excessive, but that Berkshire Hathaway abstained in a shareholders vote. Earlier on Wednesday, Coca-Cola said 83 percent of shareholders approved the plan. Critics, most notably activist investor David Winters, said the plan would dilute the holdings of current shareholders too much. As of December 31, Berkshire owned 400 million shares of the company, just over 9 percent of the shares outstanding. Buffett said he and partner Charlie Munger did not want to vote against the plan because he did not want to show disapproval of management, adding that he has enormous respect for Coca-Cola’s chief executive, Muhtar Kent. “I love Coke, I love the management, I love the directors, so I didn’t want to vote ‘No,’” Buffett said. “It’s kind of un-American to vote ‘No’ at a Coke meeting. I didn’t want to express any disapproval of management but we did disapprove of the plan. The plan compared to past plans was a significant change.” Buffett said he has no intention of selling any Coca-Cola shares. The Coca-Cola board of directors “respects Mr. Buffett’s philosophical stance on equity-based compensation,” the board said in a statement. “We greatly respect his views and look forward to continuing our productive relationship with him for many years to come,” the statement added. Nonetheless, Buffett said that investor activism is getting stronger. “The CEOs are terrified of activists. I can tell you that,” Buffett said. “They are all talking to investment bankers and lawyers and saying, ‘What do we do about this?’” He denied he had soured on his enormous investment in IBM (IBM.N), and said Berkshire bought some more shares this year, although the purchases did not come after IBM’s most recent earnings report. He said he would not rule out future IBM stock buys. Buffett was in New York for lunch with an anonymous bidder who paid $1,000,100 to win last year’s “Power Lunch with Warren Buffett” auction benefiting San Francisco’s Glide Foundation. His New York visit comes ahead of the company’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 3.

The company, which operates convenience store chain Oxxo and co-owns Coke bottler Coca-Cola Femsa  with the Coca Cola  Co, reported a profit of 2.488 billion pesos ($190.5 million) in the three months to the end of March, compared to 2.613 billion pesos a year earlier. A pickup in sales of still beverages including water and new Oxxo store openings helped revenue climb 14.3 percent to 64.228 billion pesos, the company said. Femsa holds a 20 percent stake in Heineken, the world’s third-largest brewer, after selling its beer business to the Dutch company in 2010. Heineken said its first-quarter profit fell to EUR143 million from EUR 227 million in the first quarter of 2013. Femsa’s bottling business Coke Femsa earlier on Wednesday also reported a lower first-quarter profit on higher debt costs.

The company reported a profit of 2.310 billion pesos ($177 million), down from 2.434 billion pesos a year earlier.

445,KO,Buffett pressures Coke privately on compensation plan after publicly abstaining: WSJ,"(Reuters) - The Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) is likely to revise its controversial equity compensation plan for executives before it goes into effect in 2015, following pressure from Warren Buffett, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Buffett, chairman of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), made his reservations about the plan known privately in recent weeks to Coca-Cola’s Chief Executive Muhtar Kent in three conversations, the Journal quoted sources as saying.

447,KO,"WRAPUP 2-Buffett defends Coke, BNSF at Berkshire annual meeting","(Adds details from meeting throughout) By Luciana Lopez OMAHA, Neb., May 3 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday defended his recent controversial vote on executive pay at Coca-Cola Co and disappointing performance at railroad BNSF, as investors grilled him on his Berkshire Hathaway Inc   conglomerate at its annual shareholder meeting. The investment guru was peppered with questions at the meeting, part of a mostly festive weekend that Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists,” following concerns that Berkshire last year missed Buffett’s five-year growth target for the first time in his 49 years at the helm. Buffett, 83, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 90, took the stage at a downtown Omaha arena as they faced off with the audience and a hand-picked panel often excusing recent worries at the sprawling conglomerate. “Over any cycle we will over-perform, but there’s no guarantee on that,” he said. Berkshire, he said, is designed to perform best when markets are at their worst, unlike in 2013 when the Standard & Poor’s 500 rose 30 percent. Buffett was immediately questioned about Berkshire’s decision to abstain from the shareholder vote on Coca-Cola’s equity compensation plan for executives, even though Buffett thought the controversial plan was excessive. That revelation drew sharp criticism in the run-up to the meeting - particularly since Buffett has in the past called options wasteful and akin to a free lottery ticket. Seated with Munger at a table containing several bottles of Coke and Cherry Coke, Buffett said that “going to war” would likely not have been productive, and that Berkshire’s abstention sent an even more effective message. “We made a very clear statement about the excessiveness of the plan and, at the same time, we in no way went to war with Coca-Cola,” Buffett said. “I don’t think going to war is a very good idea in most situations.” Buffett said he had conversations with Coke’s chief executive, Muhtar Kent, including one in Omaha, where he said he thought the plan was excessive. “I think the best result for the Coca-Cola Company was achieved by our abstention, and we will see what happens in terms of compensation between now and the next meeting of Coke,” he said. Wall Street also came under the spotlight from a person complaining about why more individuals were not being held criminally responsible for recent misconduct, such as from the 2008 financial crisis. “I don’t think there’s anything that changes behavior more than prosecuting individuals,” Munger said. Buffett agreed, recalling his experience at Salomon Inc more than two decades ago, when he became chairman to help clean up a Treasury auction rigging scandal. “I may be biased from my experiences at Salomon, but I lean more toward prosecution of individuals than corporations,” he said. “It’s way easier to prosecute corporations - it’s somebody else’s money, and the prosecution knows it’s going to get a win. (Corporations’) calculus is such that it just doesn’t make sense to fight if you can just write a check, while the individual is fighting to stay out of jail.” The questions came a day after Berkshire posted first-quarter results that just missed analyst forecasts. That report noted weather-related disruptions at railroad BNSF - another topic of concern on Saturday. Buffett handed off, calling in BNSF executive chairman Matt Rose to talk about the company’s service challenges. “We’re making significant investments,” Rose reassured the audience. Buffett added that Berkshire could spend “many, many billions” to improve operations at the railroad, which is the country’s largest player in the booming oil-by-rail business. In contrast, he said a different business, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, was more able to grow through acquisitions. Indeed, much of Berkshire’s growth as a company has come through acquisitions, but it now takes bigger transactions to move the needle. Buffett signaled he would gladly partner again with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, with which he teamed up to buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co last year for $23.3 billion. “We’re very likely to partner with them, perhaps on some things that are very large,” Buffett said. “I think 3G does a magnificent job of running businesses.” Later, he added: “What we really want to do at our present size and scope (is) buy big businesses with good management and prices, and then build them over time.” Last year, Berkshire underperformed for the first time in nearly 50 years by Buffett’s own preferred measure: gains in the company’s book value, or worth, lagged the S&P; 500. Shareholders at the meeting also rejected a proposal that Berkshire start paying a dividend, after having not made any cash payouts since 1967. The annual meeting in Omaha draws tens of thousands of people to hear Buffett and Munger talk about business, the economy, and even politics and life. It includes a massive exhibit floor that highlights the breadth of Berkshire’s holdings, including Geico car insurance, Borsheim’s jewelry and Dairy Queen ice cream. Before the meeting, Buffett paid $1 for a Dairy Queen vanilla orange bar. As usual, hundreds of shareholders lined up outside the arena well before the doors opened at 7 a.m. CDT. Michael Rodin, owner of Impact Promotional Marketing Products in Des Moines, Iowa, said he arrived at 1 a.m., after having attended more than 20 prior meetings. “The excitement, to get as close to the action as possible, and see the man close, and not with his face on the video screen,” Rodin explained on his strategy. At one point Buffett was asked if he had lost confidence in Berkshire. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett disclosed that he had suggested to his estate’s trustee that money left to his wife be largely invested in a low-cost S&P; index fund. The question posed: Why an index fund and not Berkshire stock? Because, he said, he’s unconcerned about maximizing the money he will leave his wife after he passes away. “There will be loads of capital left over” for her, Buffett said.

On Saturday, Buffett said that “going to war” would likely not have been productive, and that Berkshire’s abstention sent a clear message. “I think the best result for the Coca-Cola Company was achieved by our abstention, and we will see what happens in terms of compensation between now and the next meeting of Coke.” But he also talked about the social pressures of board votes on compensation plans. “The social dynamics are important in board actions,” he said. The questions came a day after Berkshire Hathaway released first-quarter earnings that just missed analyst expectations. That report noted weather-related disruptions at railroad BNSF - another topic of questioning on Saturday. Buffett handed off, calling in BNSF executive chairman Matt Rose to talk about the company’s service challenges. “We’re making significant investments,” Rose reassured the audience. And Buffett added that Berkshire could spend “many, many billions” to improve operations at the railroad, which is the country’s largest player in the booming oil-by-rail business. Last year, Berkshire Hathaway underperformed for the first time in nearly 50 years by Buffett’s own preferred measure: gains in the company’s book value, or worth, over five years lagged total returns in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index. That has prompted questions on whether the so-called Oracle of Omaha is finding it harder and harder to generate the stellar returns he’s delivered for decades, particularly as the company grows so big it needs larger deals to make a difference to the bottom line. The annual meeting in Omaha draws tens of thousands of people to hear Buffett and Munger answer hours of questions. The two talk about not only on the company’s future, but on such topics as U.S. monetary policy and politics. The meeting includes a massive exhibit floor that highlights the breadth of Berkshire’s holdings - from ice cream at Dairy Queen to insurance at Geico, the BNSF railroad to jewelry retailer Borsheims. While Buffett faced some pointed questioning from shareholders, many people in attendance here just listened to him because they consider themselves fans. At one point Buffett, surprisingly, was asked if he had lost confidence in Berkshire Hathaway. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett disclosed that he had suggested to his estate’s trustee that money left to his wife be largely invested in a low-cost Standard & Poor’s index fund. The question posed: Why an index fund and not Berkshire stock? Because, he said, he’s unconcerned about maximizing the money he will leave his wife after he passes away. “There will be loads of capital left over” for her, Buffett said.

449,KO,"Buffett defends Coke, BNSF at Berkshire annual meeting","OMAHA, Nebraska (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday defended his recent controversial vote on executive pay at Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and disappointing performance at railroad BNSF, as investors grilled him on his Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) conglomerate at its annual shareholder meeting. The investment guru was peppered with questions at the meeting, part of a mostly festive weekend that Buffett calls “Woodstock for Capitalists,” following concerns that Berkshire last year missed Buffett’s five-year growth target for the first time in his 49 years at the helm. Buffett, 83, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 90, took the stage at a downtown Omaha arena as they faced off with the audience and a hand-picked panel often excusing recent worries at the sprawling conglomerate. ""Over any cycle we will over-perform, but there's no guarantee on that,"" he said. Berkshire, he said, is designed to perform best when markets are at their worst, unlike in 2013 when the Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX rose 30 percent. Buffett was immediately questioned about Berkshire’s decision to abstain from the shareholder vote on Coca-Cola’s equity compensation plan for executives, even though Buffett thought the controversial plan was excessive. That revelation drew sharp criticism in the run-up to the meeting - particularly since Buffett has in the past called options wasteful and akin to a free lottery ticket. Seated with Munger at a table containing several bottles of Coke and Cherry Coke, Buffett said that “going to war” would likely not have been productive, and that Berkshire’s abstention sent an even more effective message. “We made a very clear statement about the excessiveness of the plan and, at the same time, we in no way went to war with Coca-Cola,” Buffett said. “I don’t think going to war is a very good idea in most situations.” Buffett said he had conversations with Coke’s chief executive, Muhtar Kent, including one in Omaha, where he said he thought the plan was excessive. “I think the best result for the Coca-Cola Company was achieved by our abstention, and we will see what happens in terms of compensation between now and the next meeting of Coke,” he said. Wall Street also came under the spotlight from a person complaining about why more individuals were not being held criminally responsible for recent misconduct, such as from the 2008 financial crisis. “I don’t think there’s anything that changes behavior more than prosecuting individuals,” Munger said. Buffett agreed, recalling his experience at Salomon Inc more than two decades ago, when he became chairman to help clean up a Treasury auction rigging scandal. “I may be biased from my experiences at Salomon, but I lean more toward prosecution of individuals than corporations,” he said. “It’s way easier to prosecute corporations - it’s somebody else’s money, and the prosecution knows it’s going to get a win. (Corporations’) calculus is such that it just doesn’t make sense to fight if you can just write a check, while the individual is fighting to stay out of jail.” The questions came a day after Berkshire posted first-quarter results that just missed analyst forecasts. That report noted weather-related disruptions at railroad BNSF - another topic of concern on Saturday. Buffett handed off, calling in BNSF executive chairman Matt Rose to talk about the company’s service challenges. “We’re making significant investments,” Rose reassured the audience. Buffett added that Berkshire could spend “many, many billions” to improve operations at the railroad, which is the country’s largest player in the booming oil-by-rail business. In contrast, he said a different business, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, was more able to grow through acquisitions. Indeed, much of Berkshire’s growth as a company has come through acquisitions, but it now takes bigger transactions to move the needle. Buffett signaled he would gladly partner again with Brazilian firm 3G Capital, with which he teamed up to buy ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co last year for $23.3 billion. “We’re very likely to partner with them, perhaps on some things that are very large,” Buffett said. “I think 3G does a magnificent job of running businesses.” Later, he added: “What we really want to do at our present size and scope (is) buy big businesses with good management and prices, and then build them over time. Last year, Berkshire underperformed for the first time in nearly 50 years by Buffett’s own preferred measure: gains in the company’s book value, or worth, lagged the S&P; 500. Shareholders at the meeting also rejected a proposal that Berkshire start paying a dividend, after having not made any cash payouts since 1967. The annual meeting in Omaha draws tens of thousands of people to hear Buffett and Munger talk about business, the economy, and even politics and life. It includes a massive exhibit floor that highlights the breadth of Berkshire’s holdings, including Geico car insurance, Borsheim’s jewelry and Dairy Queen ice cream. Before the meeting, Buffett paid $1 for a Dairy Queen vanilla orange bar. As usual, hundreds of shareholders lined up outside the arena well before the doors opened at 7 a.m. CDT. Michael Rodin, owner of Impact Promotional Marketing Products in Des Moines, Iowa, said he arrived at 1 a.m., after having attended more than 20 prior meetings. “The excitement, to get as close to the action as possible, and see the man close, and not with his face on the video screen,” Rodin explained on his strategy. At one point Buffett was asked if he had lost confidence in Berkshire. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett disclosed that he had suggested to his estate’s trustee that money left to his wife be largely invested in a low-cost S&P; index fund. The question posed: Why an index fund and not Berkshire stock? Because, he said, he’s unconcerned about maximizing the money he will leave his wife after he passes away. “There will be loads of capital left over” for her, Buffett said.

450,KO,"Coke to remove controversial chemical from Fanta, other drinks","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Coca-Cola Company said on Monday it will remove a controversial flavoring stabilizer from some of its drinks, following rival PepsiCo Inc’s announcement earlier this year that it would drop the same ingredient from its drinks. The ingredient, brominated vegetable oil (BVO), is a chemical containing bromine, which is found in fire retardants. Small quantities of BVO are used legally in some citrus-flavored drinks in the United States to keep the flavor evenly distributed. Coca-Cola said the ingredient was dropped from two flavors of its Powerade drink - fruit punch and strawberry lemonade - earlier this year. The company expects to remove it from its Fanta and Fresca sods, and as well as citrus-flavored fountain drinks, by year’s end for U.S. consumers. The company said it will also remove the ingredient in its products sold globally but did not provide a timeline. Coke, which has said its use of BVO was safe for consumers, will use as a replacement sucrose acetate isobutyrate, which it has used for over a decade in some drinks, or glycerol ester of rosin, a ingredient commonly found in chewing gums and drinks, the company said. The use of the chemical in sports drinks has drawn concern from consumers as well as from a Mississippi teenager, Sarah Kavanagh, who circulated two online petitions to put pressure on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo to remove the ingredient from their drinks. Kavanagh’s PepsiCo petition received more than 200,000 signatures and, after the company announced the change in late January, the teenager declared victory. The Coca Cola petition had been signed by some 60,000 people as of Monday. “I knew that if Gatorade could do the right thing, so could Powerade,” Kavanagh said. “I’m glad to know the Powerade sold at my school and consumed by people around the world will be a little bit healthier without BVO in it.” According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a food safety watchdog group, BVO is a “poorly tested and possibly dangerous food additive and there’s no reason to use it in Gatorade or other drinks.” ",5052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-beverages-coke-bvo/coke-to-remove-controversial-chemical-from-fanta-other-drinks-idUSKBN0DL17L20140505

452,KO,Buffett says Congress may look at tax-driven mergers: CNBC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett said on Monday that tax-driven mergers could attract the attention of Congress and would cause a “fight” in corporate America. Buffett, in reference to U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc.’s aim to lower its tax rate by changing its domicile to Britain as part of its pursuit of Britain’s AstraZeneca Plc, said that more companies were seeking mergers for tax-driven reasons. “It will gather momentum and my guess is that when you get to companies of this size, this prominence, and with this speed up of momentum, my guess is that Congress one way or another addresses this,” Buffett told cable television network CNBC. “This whole thing on the foreign situation I think will cause one hell of a fight in corporate America,” he said. Buffett said that while there could be a new resolution to corporate taxes beyond the topic of foreign tax rates, U.S. companies were flourishing under the current tax code. “American business, I will tell you, whether it’s Berkshire Hathaway or Pfizer or Apple, are doing wonderfully under this tax code.” Buffett also said that moves in U.S. government bond interest rates did not affect how Berkshire operated. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 2.572 percent on Monday, its lowest level in over three months. “If it moved up 50 basis points or down 50 basis points, we would not do anything differently. We don’t react to macro factors at Berkshire,” he said. He said the 10-year yield would likely be higher than 3 percent by the end of the year. Buffett also reiterated that he had no desire to “go to war” with Coca-Cola Co, and that his approach to the company’s controversial equity compensation plan was more effective than the style that might be used by activist investor Carl Icahn. Buffett, responding to criticism from Icahn regarding Buffett’s decision to abstain from the shareholder vote, said, “I think our style actually would be more effective than the style that might be proposed by Carl.” Buffett told CNBC he had not spoken to Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent since the company’s annual meeting on April 23. Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger said later in the interview that he agreed with Buffett’s decision to abstain from the vote, and that it was not a “difficult decision.” “It took about 10 seconds,” Munger said. “I thought he handled it perfectly.” Munger also said that he was against exporting natural gas given how “precious” it is. “I’m totally against exporting natural gas. I don’t like oil to be exported either,” he said. Buffett also praised Berkshire Hathaway portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, and said that while they were not candidates to succeed him as chief executive, their duties in investing would aid the next chief executive. “They will not be the chief executive officer, but they will be there to help the chief executive officer in that arena,” he said.

454,KO,Coca-Cola to close two Russian juice plants as market shrinks,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) is closing two of its four fruit juice plants in Russia in response to falling demand, putting at risk hundreds of jobs in a business which the U.S. company had bought for $276 million four years ago. The company will close the two plants run by its Nidan unit on June 1 and transfer some of their capacity to the other juice unit, Multon, before the year-end, spokesman Vladimir Kravtsov said on Thursday. The plants being closed are located in Novosibirsk in Siberia and in the Moscow region. Some of the unit’s 1,000 staff will be offered jobs at Multon, Kravtsov added. “The juice market fell by 5 percent last year and the performance of Nidan was worse than the market,” said Kravtsov, adding the company had been considering the move for some time and made the closure decision at the end of last year. Coca-Cola bought Nidan, then the fourth-biggest juice maker in Russia, in 2010. Multon, which it acquired in 2005, has two plants with a combined production capacity of more than 790 million liters a year. The Russian juice market fell by 6 percent year-on-year in volume terms in January-September 2013, according to market researchers Nielsen. In addition to falling market volumes, Coca-Cola and its rival PepsiCo PEP.N are faced with increased competition from local Russian brands. The decision also coincides with an economic slowdown in Russia. Having started to shrink in the first quarter this year, the economy is on the brink of recession, in large part because of capital outflows and declining investments resulting from Moscow’s involvement in the Ukraine crisis. Based on Euromonitor data, Coca-Cola had a 23.5 percent share of the Russian juice market, worth an estimated $4.6 billion in 2013, while PepsiCo PEP.N had 35.5 percent. That was down from 24.4 percent and 37.2 percent respectively in 2012, while local producers Sady Pridonya, Sunfruit-Trade as well as France’s Lactalis all increased their market shares last year. Kravtsov said Nidan accounted for around one third of Coca-Cola’s juice production in Russia.

Both the Dow and the S&P; 500 hit record intraday highs and then pulled back a bit, holding slim gains in afternoon trading. In contrast, the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks was down 0.7 percent. “Technically new highs are usually a bullish event, but we’re not seeing news to really inspire people, so we’re holding in here at these new highs,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. Homebuilders’ shares gained, while the common stock of mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  jumped as Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mel Watt laid out new policies that could make it easier for many Americans to obtain mortgages. Fannie Mae shot up 8.3 percent to $4.59 while Freddie Mac jumped 6.9 percent to $4.49. Keurig Green Mountain Inc was the S&P; 500’s biggest percentage gainer, up 9.6 percent at $121.30 after Coca-Cola Co  said it will raise its stake in the company, the maker of  the popular Keurig one-cup coffee brewer, to 16 percent from 10 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.91 points or 0.12 percent, to 16,715.38.

The dip in the Russell 2000 follows its biggest daily percentage gain since early March. At its session low on Friday, the index was down exactly 10 percent from the intraday record high set in early March. O’Rourke said he expects more consolidation in the Russell 2000, given how long it had outperformed the S&P; 500. Among homebuilders, the stock of D.R. Horton Inc rose 2.3 percent to $23.11. The PHLX housing sector index  gained 0.7 percent. In deal news, DirecTV shares fell 0.8 percent to $86.49 a day after sources told Reuters that AT&T; Inc was in active talks to buy the company in a deal that could be worth close to $50 billion.

The S&P; 500 rose above 1,900 for the first time, extending its year-to-date rise to 2.7 percent. Retail sales rose 0.1 percent in April, less than expected, though March’s read was revised upward. Separately, April import prices fell 0.4 percent while export prices dropped 1 percent. Analysts were expecting both to have risen 0.3 percent. “The retail number was weak, but last month was revised higher and there are few places to go other than equities in this market,” said James Liu, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds in Chicago. “Even though we’re at an all-time high, which is psychologically important, we’re not especially overstretched from a performance basis, given our gains this year. There’s still room for us to move to the upside.” Homebuilders were among the biggest gainers on the day. D.R.

The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7.19 points, or 0.17 percent, at 4,151.05. Gains this year have come on improving signs of domestic growth, though traders continue to worry about the pace of economic expansion as well as tensions between Ukraine and Russia, which many fear could escalate into further violence. Keurig Green Mountain Inc was the S&P;’s biggest gainer, up 9.9 percent to $121.64 after Coca-Cola Co said it will raise its stake in the company to 16 percent from 10 percent.

AT&T; fell 1.6 percent to $35.98. In the latest from Ukraine, Russia said new European Union sanctions would hinder efforts to defuse the situation, urging the West to persuade Kiev to hold discussions on the country’s future structure before a May 25 presidential election. China’s economic activity showed across-the-board weakness in April, with economic indicators on investment and consumption missing expectations.

461,KO,UPDATE 2-Coca-Cola to boost stake in Keurig to become biggest shareholder,"(Adds comment from industry expert, background; updates shares) By Maria Ajit Thomas May 13 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co plans to raise its stake in Keurig Green Mountain Inc to 16 percent from 10 percent, which will make it the largest shareholder of the maker of the popular Keurig one-cup coffee brewer. Keurig’s shares jumped as much as 12 percent in morning trading on the Nasdaq. Coke’s shares were up nearly 1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. Coke’s move to raise its stake within months of its initial $1.25 billion investment in Keurig fits with its strategy of investing in brands before eventually acquiring them. Coke bought both Honest Tea and Zico, a coconut water brand, a few years after initially picking stakes in them. Coke said on Tuesday the additional 6 percent stake in Keurig would be acquired over the next few months under an accelerated purchase agreement with Credit Suisse. “These incremental purchases demonstrate our continued belief that Keurig Green Mountain has substantial growth potential,” Coke said in an emailed statement. Jeff Cioletti, editor-in-chief of Beverage World magazine, said Coke’s move was interesting in light of recent speculation that at-home soda maker Sodastream International was in early talks to sell a stake of up to 16 percent. In April, Israeli financial news daily Calcalist identified PepsiCo Inc, Dr Pepper Snapple Group or Starbucks Corp as potential investors in Sodastream. “In some ways, (Coke’s move) could be a preemptive measure to get there first ... and assert itself in the custom-beverage space,” Cioletti said. Coke and PepsiCo have been struggling with declining soda sales in developed markets such as the United States as consumers become more health conscious. Under a 10-year agreement announced in February, Coke and Keurig are developing a machine that will serve both carbonated and non-carbonated drinks. Keurig’s machines use pods filled with coffee, tea or hot chocolate powder to brew one-cup drinks at home. Coke said in February it had bought a 10 percent stake in Keurig, with the option to raise its holding to a maximum of 16 percent through open market purchases. Once it completes the purchase, Coke will own about 26 million shares of Keurig, up from 16.7 million as of Feb. 27, according to a regulatory filing. (link.reuters.com/qak39v) Keurig’s shares were up 9.7 percent at $121.49 in afternoon trading on Tuesday. Up to Monday’s close, the stock had risen about 38 percent since Coke disclosed its initial stake.

465,KO,FTSE edges higher to end near 14-year peak,"* FTSE 100 index finishes 0.2 percent higher * Supermarkets advance, bid rumours around Wm Morrison * Coca-Cola HBC falls as results disappoint * House builders under pressure, Barratt down By Atul Prakash LONDON, May 16 (Reuters) - Britain’s top equity index edged higher to finish near a 14-year high on Friday, with supermarkets advancing on a defensives-led bounce and bid speculation boosting Wm Morrison. Sainsbury climbed 4.5 percent, outpacing a 3.8 percent gain by Morrisons and a 2.6 percent rise in Tesco shares . The companies were the top three gainers on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index. “Supermarkets are the best performers, with vague chatter surrounding a possible bid for Morrisons,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. Morrison’s advance was helped by mounting speculation that a U.S.-led private equity consortium was weighing a bid for the company, traders said. The Daily Mail’s market report noted talk of a possible 6.4 billion pound ($10.8 billion), or 275 pence a share, cash offer. Morrison declined to comment. The sector built on gains seen in the previous session when there was a strong bias towards defensive stocks. These often lag when markets rise, supporting a view that the good times will not roll for long. Frothy valuations are stopping investors from aggressively putting money to work in equities. The FTSE 100 is trading on a 12-month forward price/earnings ratio of 13.7 times, against its 10-year average of 11.7 times, Thomson Reuters Datastream shows. “The recent defensive rotation in equity markets underscores our view that the wider risk-on rally now looks tired,” said Graham Bishop, senior equity strategist at Exane BNP Paribas. The FTSE 100 rose 0.2 percent to 6,855.81 points to finish near this week’s 14-year high. It fell 0.6 percent in the previous session, taking its cue from Wall Street, which sold off after results from Wal-Mart disappointed and as small-cap shares extended their retreat. The UK small cap index was down 0.8 percent, while the mid-cap index fell 1.4 percent, underperforming the wider stock market. The FTSE 100’s gains were capped by losses at bottler Coca-Cola HBC after disappointing results, and as UK homebuilders fell on concerns that authorities may intervene to prevent a housing market bubble. Coca-Cola HBC, the world’s No. 2 bottler of Coca-Cola  drinks, fell 4.6 percent, the worst performing stock on the FTSE 100 after a bigger-than-expected currency-related quarterly loss  in its Russian and Ukrainian operations. Home builders fell on growing expectations that the Bank of England may try to stop a housing bubble by tightening standards for mortgage lending. Speculation is rife that the central bank’s Financial Policy Committee will toughen lending rules when it meets on June 17. Barratt Developments, the country’s biggest housebuilder by volume, fell 3.8 percent, while Persimmon  was down 1 percent. “Investors are watching house prices, which have risen quickly. The Bank of England is clearly monitoring the situation and could take some action to stop the situation turning into a bubble,” said Keith Bowman, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Britain’s housing market has made a swift recovery from the global financial crisis, with prices up about 10 percent in the past 12 months. Mining shares fell on growth concerns in countries such as China, the world’s biggest metals consumer. The UK mining index  fell 1.6 percent, led by a 2.9 percent drop in Anglo American shares.

The UK mining index was down 2.2 percent, with investors switching to defensive stocks. The FTSE 100 index was down 0.1 percent at 6,837.71 points by 1427 GMT, having dropped 0.6 percent in the previous session, taking its cue from Wall Street which sold off after results from Wal-Mart disappointed and as small-cap shares extended their retreat.

Russia, CC HBC’s biggest market in terms of sales, grew by a high single digit percentage in the first quarter. The company said Russia will remain its main growth driver, despite a likely slowdown in business over the rest of the year. “What we have seen in the last couple of quarters in the external (macro) environment will filter through to the consumers and that will be reflected in the overall trading,” chief executive officer Dimitris Lois told Reuters. “We still believe that Russia will be a key growth driver,” he said. The bottler, which buys syrup concentrate from Coca-Cola and then bottles and distributes the U.S. group’s drinks in 28 countries in Europe and Nigeria, had a net loss of 35.8 million euros ($49.1 million) in the first three months of the year, excluding restructuring and other one-off items. This was much higher than analysts’ average forecast of a 17 million euro loss in a Reuters poll. The sharp devaluation in the Russian rouble and Ukrainian hryvnia against the euro due to political tensions in Ukraine damaged CC HBC’s results. The group warned foreign exchange losses for the full year would be higher than initially expected, at around 90-100 million euros in 2014 versus the 51-70 million euros projected in February. But it was taking action including extra cost cutting in Ukraine and Russia to mitigate the impact. Greece, a significant market in terms of profit, grew for the first time after four years. But the company said it was still cautious, citing record unemployment and falling household incomes in the country.

471,KO,Exclusive: Goldman's Cohn takes on Washington to defend commodities,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President Gary Cohn, who’s from Cleveland, are friendly enough that Brown has been known to rib Cohn for abandoning the Cleveland Indians baseball team in favor of the New York Yankees. The two men first met years ago, and Cohn and his family, who are also Democrats, have contributed to Brown’s campaigns. They may like each other, but the two men are antagonists in a battle over whether Goldman can maintain its lucrative role in physically trading stuff ranging from aluminum to coal to natural gas to zinc. Brown, 61, has been a critic of the role that banks, particularly Goldman, play in commodities markets, accusing Wall Street of driving up prices for businesses and consumers. Cohn, Goldman’s No. 2 executive, met this month with lawmakers including Brown as well as U.S. Federal Reserve officials to explain why a Wall Street bank’s presence in the commodities market is actually good for Main Street. The meetings with lawmakers and the Fed, which haven’t been previously reported, show how hard Goldman is fighting to hang on to its commodities business. “For more than 30 years, we have been helping our clients manage commodity and other risks and we believe that experience has given us an important perspective on the policy debate under way today,” Goldman said in a statement. Goldman reported $902 million in commodities revenues for 2013, up from $492 million the prior year. The bank says those figures, reported in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, do not accurately reflect the way it runs its commodities business. Cohn’s meetings come after consumers, including beer-can and steel-railings manufacturers, prompted Brown to hold hearings on the subject of banks and physical commodities through a congressional subcommittee he oversees. Brown has also been considering whether to bring bankers in front of the committee to publicly question their role in the raw materials supply chain, sources said. This week, Goldman said it began a process to sell one part of its physical trading operations, a metals warehousing business called Metro International Trade Services, that has been the center of controversy over its influence on consumer prices. The Metro sale announcement follows exits from physical commodities trading businesses by top rivals including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Barclays PLC and Deutsche Bank AG. Though Goldman is selling Metro, it still would like to hold on to other physical commodities assets. The bank is counting on Cohn and other Goldman executives, including Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, to persuade regulators and lawmakers not to force its exit. The Metro sale is meant to rid Goldman of a controversial holding and appease regulators, said Kristofer Tremaine, a former commodities trader and founder of a London-based commodity trade finance fund. Goldman wrote in April to the Fed in response to a call for public comment about possible new rules on commodities trading. “The letters we and many others sent to the Fed explain the importance to the economy of managing commodity risk and we feel it is important to continue talking with those in Washington who are open to engaging on the subject,” Goldman said in its statement to Reuters. Being in the physical commodities market give banks insight into supply and demand, potentially making trading more profitable. Critics contend that Wall Street’s involvement hurts consumers and businesses, because banks can restrict the flow of material through the supply chain to drive prices higher. During their meeting, Cohn, 53, told Brown that the fears are misdirected. In practice, he said, Goldman acts as an important facilitator between buyers and sellers of commodities. Cohn argued that the bank’s role as an intermediary - with the ability to maintain inventories, lend money, be patient with debts and provide hedging products - actually helps the economy flourish, sources said. It could not be determined whether Cohn discussed the future of the Metro business with Brown in their meeting. Following the announcement, Brown put out a statement celebrating the potential sale. “This is good news for consumers, taxpayers, and manufacturers that depend on aluminum,” he said. “Banks should focus on core banking activities rather than owning physical assets like warehouses, pipelines, and tankers. Today’s announcement is a victory for beer and soft drink makers and for the safety and soundness of our financial system.” Cohn did not respond to requests for comment, and Goldman Sachs declined to make him available for an interview. Metro became the center of controversy after big consumers such as MillerCoors LLC and The Coca-Cola Co accused warehouses and their owners of exploiting London Metal Exchange storage rules to boost rental income, distorting supplies, inflating physical prices of aluminum and costing consumers billions of extra dollars annually. The issue captured public and political attention last year and the Department of Justice and Commodity Futures Trading Commission are looking into the issue. Another congressional panel, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has subpoena power, is also probing banks’ role in the commodities market. And the Fed is considering rules that could restrict such activities, or make them less profitable by requiring a capital surcharge on those it deems risky. Wall Street executives say although the Fed has not said what it wants banks to do yet, the regulator has raised the bar on banks explaining why they should be allowed to stay in such businesses. Cohn also met with Fed staff on his recent trip to explain Goldman’s position. One source close to Goldman said its outreach efforts to senators such as Brown were important as long as the Fed is “being hauled up in front of Congress.” A Fed spokeswoman declined to comment. If Goldman fends off new regulations, it could solidify its position as the leading Wall Street bank in the commodities market. Banks that have announced plans to significantly scale back their commodities trading operations have cited regulatory pressure as well as higher capital requirements that are denting profits. Wall Street banks took in as much as $14 billion in commodities trading revenue in 2008, but that figure declined to just $4.5 billion in 2013, according to data from the consulting firm Coalition. Although Goldman is facing those same pressures, the business is known to have been very profitable for it over the long term. In a January earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz described the business as “too important” to its clients to give up. “The real victor in the mass exodus of the major banks from commodity trading will likely be Goldman Sachs,” Bernstein Research analyst Brad Hintz said in a recent report. Some rivals expect Goldman to feel compelled to exit physical commodities trading. To be sure, Goldman’s ability to stay in commodities trading was grandfathered into the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. One senior Wall Street executive whose firm has decided to exit those businesses said it would not be fair to banks that have gotten out in anticipation of new Fed regulations. If Goldman is successful in its push to remain in physical commodities, rivals will see it as proof that the bank - known for its history of senior executives moving to roles in policy and regulation - still enjoys a cozy relationship with the government, the executive said. “Sen. Brown is open to hearing the viewpoints of stakeholders affected by legislation before the Banking Committee,” said spokeswoman Meghan Dubyak, in an email. “He hopes that even people he disagrees with will find him knowledgeable, accessible, and open to argument. But anyone the least bit familiar with him knows that he has the same message to all audiences - banks should stick to banking.” ",5232014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-goldman-sachs-commodities/exclusive-goldmans-cohn-takes-on-washington-to-defend-commodities-idUSBREA4M03L20140523

Coca-Cola GB, which also owns Fanta, Sprite and Dr Pepper, will spend 3 billion pounds to promote the launch in August, the newspaper said. (link.reuters.com/ruq59v) Jon Woods, general manager of Coca-Cola GB & Ireland, told The Times it had learned its lesson from the experience with Dasani, which was made from purified tap water from Sidcup yet sold at a then-premium price of 95 pence. Woods told the newspaper that although glacéau smartwater would be a premium product, it would be sold “without the premium price”, and that it would be made from natural spring water. The recommended retail price for a 600 ml (20 fluid ounce) bottle would be 57 pence, the same price charged by rivals for a 500 ml bottle, while an 850 ml bottle would sell for 89 pence, the price of rival brands’ 750 ml bottles, The Times reported. Coca-Cola, which has 106 water brands, already sells glacéau vitaminwater, a range of fruit-flavored drinks, in Britain.

474,KO,Hacker group threatens cyber-attack on World Cup sponsors -source,"SAO PAULO/BRASILIA, May 30 (Reuters) - The hacker group Anonymous is preparing a cyber-attack on corporate sponsors of the World Cup in Brazil to protest the lavish spending on the soccer games in a country struggling to provide basic services, said a hacker with knowledge of the plan on Friday. Earlier this week, Anonymous attacked the Brazil’s Foreign Ministry computer networks and leaked dozens of confidential emails. “We have already conducted late-night tests to see which of the sites are more vulnerable,” said the hacker who operates under the alias of Che Commodore. “We have a plan of attack.” “This time we are targeting the sponsors of the World Cup,” he said in a Skype conversation from an undisclosed location in Brazil. Asked to name the potential targets he mentioned Adidas , Emirates airline, the Coca-Cola Co  and Budweiser, which is owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev. Reuters had no means of confirming Che Commodore’s identity or his affiliation with Anonymous. The sponsors did not immediately respond to requests to comment on the threat. A DDoS or Distributed Denial-of-service is a low-cost attack aiming at taking a website offline by simultaneously requesting access from thousands of computers in order to jam the host server. The threat of cyber-attacks is yet another headache for the organizers of the World Cup kicking off on June 12 in Brazil. The 32-nation soccer tournament has already been marred by embarrassing delays in the building of stadiums and widespread discontent in Brazil over the excessive cost of hosting the  event in a country with deficient public services. In what could be the biggest cyber-security breach since the U.S. National Security Agency allegedly spied on President Dilma Rousseff’s personal communications, Anonymous this week posted   333 documents extracted from the Foreign Ministry’s computing network. They include a briefing of talks between Brazilian officials and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden during a visit to Brazil in May last year and a list of sport ministers that plan to attend the World Cup. A hacker known as AnonManifest used a phishing attack to break into the Foreign Ministry’s databases and eventually access its documentation system, Che Commodore told Reuters. “Until yesterday afternoon the hacker still had access to the system,” he said. The Foreign Ministry closed down its email system after the attack and instructed its 3,000 email account holders to change their passwords. Federal police is investigating the breach. A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters on Friday that only 55 email accounts were hacked and the only documents that were obtained where attached to emails and from the ministry’s internal document archive. “The problem has been resolved. Nothing important was leaked,” said the official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the matter. But Brazilian diplomats abroad were left without email communications with their headquarters for several days. One diplomat in a European capital told Reuters on Friday the email service was still down.

475,KO,UPDATE 5-Soccer sponsors raise pressure on FIFA over Qatar claims,"* Sponsors signal unease on Qatar 2022 bribe allegations * Allegations cloud build-up to Brazil tournament this week * Sponsors, broadcasters would benefit from move to another venue   (Adds Coca-Cola reaction) By Keith Weir and Ossian Shine LONDON/RIO DE JANEIRO June 8 (Reuters) - Sponsors Adidas , Sony, Visa and Coca-Cola on Sunday called on soccer’s rulers to deal thoroughly with allegations of bribery to secure the 2022 World Cup for Qatar, an issue overshadowing this week’s kickoff in Brazil. With its four yearly showpiece event only four days away, soccer’s governing body FIFA is on the defensive, conducting an internal investigation into the decisions to hold the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 Cup in Qatar. Both countries have denied any wrongdoing. Qatar’s bid has attracted controversy from the outset because of the extreme summer heat during the months when the Cup is played and the tiny country’s lack of domestic soccer tradition. If it goes ahead, the tournament is expected to be switched to a date later in the year, creating scheduling headaches for broadcasters and European club soccer clubs. The signs of unease from some of FIFA’s paymasters will raise pressure on the body, led by its 78-year-old Swiss president Sepp Blatter, to get to the bottom of the allegations and tackle underlying concerns about how it is run. “The negative tenor of the public debate around FIFA at the moment is neither good for football nor for FIFA and its partners,” said German sportswear company Adidas, which has signed up as FIFA sponsor until 2030, extending a partnership dating back to 1970. Coca-Cola concurred. “Anything that detracts from the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup is a concern to us,” a company statement read. “But we are confident that FIFA is taking these allegations very seriously and is investigating them thoroughly through the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee. “The FIFA World Cup is a platform that unites people all over the world, inspiring and celebrating the world’s most popular sport while creating memorable experiences for athletes and fans. We believe that through our partnership and continued involvement with FIFA we can help foster optimism and unity, while making a positive difference in the communities we serve.” Britain’s Sunday Times newspaper has over the last two weekends printed what it says are leaked documents showing bribes were paid to secure the event for Qatar, which Qatar denies. Former U.S. prosecutor Michael Garcia, leading FIFA’s internal investigation, is due to report in July, around a week after this year’s World Cup final. FIFA issued a statement from the body’s marketing director Thierry Weil as it sought to take heat out of the situation. “We are in constant contact with our Commercial Affiliates including adidas, Sony and Visa and they have 100 percent confidence in the investigation currently being conducted by FIFA’s independent Ethics Committee,” Weil said. “Our sponsors have not requested anything that is not covered by the on-going investigation by the Ethics Committee.” Payment card company Visa, which has a contract as a FIFA sponsor until 2022, said it was monitoring the progress of the Garcia investigation. “We expect FIFA will take the appropriate actions to respond to the report and its recommendations,” it said in a statement. Japanese consumer goods company Sony took a similar line, saying said it expected the allegations to be “investigated appropriately”. It is unusual for sponsors to say anything publicly on such a sensitive issue and the comments reflect concern over the knock-on effects on their image. “This underlines that companies need to make sure that any high profile association enhances their reputation rather than damages it,” said Andy Sutherden, Global Head of Sports Marketing & Sponsorship at communications firm H+K Strategies. FIFA, which Blatter has led since 1998, earned almost $1.4 billion last year, including more than $600 million from the sale of broadcasting rights and more than $400 million from sponsors and other marketing partners. Sony, Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola are among six main FIFA sponsors who collectively paid around $180 million last year. Sony’s sponsorship agreement, which also included the 2010 World Cup,  expires this year, giving it particular leverage as it negotiates a new deal. Airline Emirates, whose sponsorship deal is also up for renewal at the end of the year, declined to comment, as did South Korean carmaker Hyundai/Kia. The Sunday Times printed new accusations on Sunday, just four days before the 2014 tournament kicks off in Brazil, alleging that then-Asian football chief Mohamed Bin Hammam, a Qatari, had brokered meetings between Qatari officials and governments to discuss bilateral trade deals. Qatar denies Bin Hammam was connected to its bid for the Cup. Bin Hammam has not commented. FIFA has already banned Bin Hammam for life from soccer over accusations he paid bribes to win votes for a bid to become FIFA president. That ban was overturned but another was imposed for conflicts of interest. FIFA is now facing calls to strip Qatar of the World Cup should Garcia’s investigation prove that it bought the votes needed to host the tournament. The United States, Australia, Japan and South Korea were the rivals who lost out to Qatar in the 2010 vote and are all safer choices as former hosts of major sporting events and developed markets for consumer brands. U.S. broadcaster Fox, which paid an estimated $425 million for rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, was already unhappy with plans to switch the dates of the Qatar tournament to later in the calendar year when it would clash with the NFL American football programme. Both fans and sponsors would be likely to cheer a switch to a different venue, although Qatar would be certain to mount a legal challenge to keep the Cup. “None of the sponsors would want it to be held in Qatar,” said David Peters, managing director of marketing company Dentsu Aegis Network Sport & Entertainment. “FIFA haven’t given a great deal of consideration to sponsors. The sport is so big, they are less beholden than other sports,” he added.

477,KO,U.S. rules for POM against Coke in labeling dispute,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that drink producer POM Wonderful LLC can sue over allegations that Coca-Cola Co(KO.N) has misled consumers over its marketing of Minute Maid pomegranate blueberry juice. The court ruled in favor of POM on an 8-0 vote, with Justice Stephen Breyer recused. POM had filed a lawsuit against Coca-Cola saying it had misled customers by selling a pomegranate blueberry juice even though it had 0.5 percent of the two juices. POM, which makes a drink that is 100 percent pomegranate, said the label would hurt sales for its own product.  Although the case pitted two businesses against each other, POM hailed the ruling as a victory for consumers.     “We believe that when people better understand what they are consuming, they can make healthy and more informed decisions about what they buy,” the company said in a statement. POM Wonderful also makes food products. Both a U.S. District Court in California and a federal appeals court said that POM could not bring its claims under the federal Lanham Act but the Supreme Court reversed that finding. “We intend to defend against POM’s claims that our labeling is misleading and the evidence at trial will show that our product was not the cause of POM’s poor sales,” Coca-Cola said in a statement.  Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote on behalf of a unanimous court that challenges such as POM’s are permitted even though food and beverage labels are regulated under another federal law, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The lower courts had said that it was the prerogative of the Food and Drug Administration, and not private parties, to object to juice labels which are potentially misleading.  Various business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Beverage Association, had backed Coca-Cola in the case. The federal government filed a brief supporting neither side, saying some claims could move forward but not others. Kennedy wrote that, contrary to what Coca-Cola argued, the two laws complement each other. He noted, for example, that the FDA “does not have the same perspective or expertise in assessing market dynamics that day-to-day competitors possess.” POM has itself run into legal problems over allegations of misleading consumers. In January 2013, the Federal Trade Commission said the company was deceptive in advertising that its pomegranate juice and other products had been clinically proven to reduce the risk of heart disease and other ailments. That case is currently on appeal. Justices do not usually reveal why they recuse themselves in cases so it was not disclosed why Breyer did not participate. The case is POM Wonderful LLC v.

480,KO,"Coca-Cola invests in Egypt and Pakistan, sees big sales growth","CAIRO (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) expects to start production in five new factories in Egypt and Pakistan over the next 18 months, seeing double-digit percentage growth in sales for both markets this year, its Middle East and North Africa president told Reuters. The U.S. soft drinks maker’s investment is a particular boost for Egypt, which is desperate to attract foreign direct investment after three years of political and economic turmoil that has seen its foreign currency reserves shrink and budget deficit swell to around 14 percent of GDP last year. “Egypt is going to be one of our key anchor countries,” Curt Ferguson said on Wednesday, citing the country’s large and growing population as a big positive. “For sure the other key anchor will be Pakistan.” As part of a $500 million investment plan announced for Egypt in March, Coca-Cola will start constructing a new juice plant in 6th of October city near Cairo next year in a joint $100 million dollar project with Saudi Arabia’s Aujan Coca-Cola Beverages Company. The $500 million will be spent over the next three years, Ferguson said. The beverage group is in talks to buy a plot of land between Cairo and Alexandria to build a plant for sparkling drinks and water which should go online next year, Ferguson added. The rest of the $500 million will be used to increase production at existing plants such as its concentrate factory in Cairo, the only one of its kind in the Middle East, and to cover capital spending. In Egypt, the company wants to redevelop production lines and keep distributing tens of thousands of Coca-Cola branded fridges to small supermarkets every year. Just to keep its business ticking over, Coca-Cola needs to spend more than $75 million a year in the country on such costs. The Cairo concentrate plant exports more than 30 percent of its produce and Coca-Cola wants to double exports from this facility within about three years, Ferguson said, sipping a can of coke light in the regional headquarters in Cairo. When asked about recent tax increases in Egypt, Ferguson said Coca-Cola could live with the tax rates and understood Egypt’s need to increase its revenues, but added lower taxes and clear, well-organized economic reforms would help investors.  “Business needs certainty,” he said, listing recent presidential elections as helping stability in the country. “The clearer, the easier, the lower the tax rate, you’re going to attract the most investment. It’s that easy.” Surpassing Egypt for its sales growth, Pakistan will see three new plants open in the next 18 months in Karachi, Multan and Islamabad to serve the domestic market with sparkling drinks such as Coke, Fanta and Sprite. “We watch the needle in Pakistan and almost every month we red-line on what our capacity is,” Ferguson said, adding he expected sales growth of around 20 percent in Pakistan this year. “We’re just scratching the surface there.” Coca-Cola has also purchased land in the Palestinian Gaza Strip for a bottling factory for which it has already paid $20 million and which should go online in the first quarter of 2015, Ferguson said. The company hopes U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry might open the Gaza plant, Ferguson said, adding the group had received all necessary permits from Israel, which has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip. Kerry has not visited the Gaza Strip since becoming Secretary of State. Further expanding into the region, Coca-Cola has started building its first factory in Qatar for $40 million, to be finished before an expected surge in demand for the 2022 soccer World Cup in the desert country. “It’s us and nine stadiums,” Ferguson joked of the construction.

The bottler, which moved its tax base from Greece to Switzerland and its primary listing from Athens to London last year, said its ADR programme was not contributing much to facilitating trading in its securities, accounting for only about 1.3 percent of total volume in the past 12 months. “Since our premium listing on the London Stock Exchange  on 29 April 2013, the United Kingdom has become the principal trading market for our shares”, CC HBC said in a statement. The delisting is expected to take effect around the end of July.

485,KO,Coke yearns for higher margins to tempt franchisees,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co may have annual profits of about $9.3 billion, but that princely sum could fall short of what the world’s largest soda maker needs to tempt would-be franchisees into taking over more of its regional bottling operations. That is one of the biggest puzzles the Atlanta-based soft drink company is struggling to solve as it prepares to report second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. North American profit margins will likely show an improvement from the roughly 14.5 percent in the year-ago period, but may still fall short of what is needed to lure more independent bottlers to bid for Coke’s North American bottling operations. Following a similar move by rival PepsiCo Inc, which reports earnings on Wednesday, Coke bought back its top bottler in the region in 2010 to streamline decision-making and cut costs. Now Coke has changed direction again and is seeking to sell the bottling operations to franchisees in a bid to shift away from the capital intensive and low-margin business of distribution to focus on what it is best at: branding and innovation. Some progress has already been made on that front. According to the trade publication Beverage Digest, Coke directly controlled 78.7 percent of U.S. distribution at the end of last year. Today that number is lower: In February, Coke announced deals to sell bottling operations in the greater Chicago and central Florida areas. Irial Finan, Coke’s head of bottling investments, said at a conference in June that the company was being “methodical” in its approach, adding that the company would go faster if it could but wanted to get it right. But analysts say it could be difficult for Coke to hand over distribution to independent bottlers on a wider scale unless its North American profits grew enough to give bottling partners a large enough share to cover their cost of capital. “Right now the profit pool is too low for it to be split up in a sustainable way,” said Stephen Powers, a beverage analyst at UBS. That is partly because U.S. consumers are buying less soda as they become more health conscious, a trend that has pressured carbonated soft-drink sales for years. The concern may help explain why Coke shares have edged up just 2.6 percent this year, underperforming the Standard & Poor’s 500, which is up 6.8 percent over the same period.  Powers said he expects North American profit margins to improve in the second quarter from a year ago after a first quarter decline, with the help of the Easter holiday, which fell in the second quarter this year. Margins are stronger outside North America where Coke does most of its business. But the region still accounts for about 45 percent of Coke’s cost base, he said.  Investors will also be looking for commentary on pricing during Coke’s conference call. The company said last quarter that the overall prices that it charges to customers increased 2 percent globally.     That bodes well for both Coke and PepsiCo, which usually move in tandem. When it comes to soft drinks, “both have to be more concerned about growing the category than beating each other up,” said Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “They should play nice.” As of Friday afternoon, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting Coke to earn 63 cents a share on $12.8 billion in revenue. Analysts expect Pepsi to earn $1.23 per share on revenue of $16.8 billion.

To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at . Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)   Apple offers Wall Street a glimpse into its quiet second quarter, but investors are already looking ahead to the fall, when the iPhone maker typically unveils the latest iteration of its best-selling smartphone. Hope persists that the company, which has not unveiled a product in a new category since 2010, will also have another trick up its sleeve, such as the oft-rumored iWatch.   Microsoft is expected to report a slightly lower fiscal fourth-quarter profit, partly due to the acquisition of Nokia’s handset business in April, but investors are already looking past that - pushing the stock up to new 14-year highs - and want to hear more details from new CEO Satya Nadella about the recent 18,000 job cuts and get more color on how exactly he plans to reshape the company as a mobile and cloud-focused competitor to Google and Apple.   Verizon is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings. Some investors have been skeptical of the company’s reluctance to follow its competitors’ aggressive discounts in a near-saturated market. Investors will look closely at Verizon’s revenue and churn, or wireless customer defections, to gauge how customers are responding to some of the most competitive pricing the industry has seen. Separately, Comcast, which made a $45.3 billion bid to acquire Time Warner Cable in February, is scheduled to report its second-quarter results.   Beverage giant Coca-Cola is expected report second-quarter earnings before the market opens. The company has posted three straight quarters of sales declines due to weak demand for sodas, but investors have started to see glimmers of hope that the worst might be behind it. Stagnating sales in North America, Coke’s biggest market, and the continuing fall in demand for sodas have some investors on the edge. They will be watching out for unit volume growth in developed markets and sales trends in international regions. Coke is expected to marginally miss sales expectations this quarter.   The Labor Department is expected to report that inflation rose 0.3 percent in June, after rising food prices pushed the index to its biggest increase in more than a year in May. (0830/1230) Investors will also watch for a report from the Commerce Department on existing home sales, which likely rose to 4.97 million in June. (1000/1400) The Federal Housing Finance Agency is scheduled to release its House Price Index for May. (0900/1300) Meanwhile the Cleveland Fed is expected to issue its median CPI for June. (1130/1530) Also, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond is likely to issue Manufacturing and Services indices for July. (1000/1400)   McDonald’s, likely to post second-quarter results, is struggling to turn its business around - particularly in its home market, the United States. Investors are looking to see if its new back-to-basics strategy focusing on value and new products is gaining traction.   Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon’s largest supplier, is expected to report second-quarter results. The company has been hit by U.S. government budget cuts over the past year and a half. Its sales to the U.S. military are likely to drop by about 6 percent in 2014 on top of a 4 percent drop last year. However, the company said it expects foreign sales to offset some of the drop in U.S. orders. Analysts will also be keen for comment on the impact of the grounding of the F-35 - the world’s most expensive weapons project - after the engine on a plane failed at a Florida airbase in June.   Credit Suisse is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings after a multi-billion dollar settlement and a guilty plea in a tax evasion investigation by U.S. prosecutors.   Activist investor William Ackman, on a 19-month long public relations campaign to prove his allegations that nutrition company Herbalife is running a pyramid scheme, is planning another public presentation where he is expected to discuss the company’s nutrition clubs. State and federal regulators are already probing the company’s business model and the stock price came under pressure at the end of the week amid news that Ackman has scheduled a presentation. (1000/1400)   Travelers Cos, expected to report earnings, may benefit from low claims during the second quarter. The Dow 30 component said it incurred after-tax catastrophe losses of about $150 million in the second quarter. Travelers said it was looking to grow market share through discounting auto insurance prices. The company’s results are a bellwether for the property and casualty insurance industry.   United Technologies is expected to report second-quarter results, with analysts watching orders for the Otis elevator division, which is heavily leveraged to China. Analysts will also keep an eye on the company’s potentially slowing residential building market, and the aftermarket of spare parts for its aerospace businesses. The diversified U.S. manufacturer said last month it would record a $440 million charge in the quarter tied to a revamped helicopter contract with Canada for its Sikorsky unit.   Video game maker Electronic Arts is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings as titles for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles like “FIFA” gain steam but sales of games for older versions of the devices continue to slip. Analysts expect the company to report in-line results driven by the robust sales of the Xbox One exclusive “Titanfall.” Investors will keep an eye on Electronic Arts’ full-year guidance, which analysts expect will remain unchanged, as the company steps up its efforts to rein in costs and bring about margin expansion from digital sales.   Omnicom, the No.1 U.S. advertising company’s second-quarter profit and revenue is likely to beat analysts’ estimates. Omnicom is expected to benefit from higher ad spending in the United States.   Witnesses not yet announced for hearing where Democrats are likely to call for immediate steps by Congress and the White House to stem the surge in corporate inversion deals by U.S. companies moving their tax domiciles overseas to avoid U.S. taxes. Republicans will likely urge that the issue be set aside until comprehensive tax reform can be undertaken, which is unlikely until mid-2015 at the earliest.   Virtualization software maker VMware is expected to report second-quarter revenue in line with estimates. Analysts expect the early closing of some deals and robust demand for the company’s cloud infrastructure services to add to revenue. They also expect the company’s booking rate to grow.   Discover Financial Services’ second-quarter results are expected to top estimates. Discover, like Capital One, is also expected to benefit from lower loan-loss reserves and rise in consumer spending. Discover is also making an attempt to tap Asian markets.    Broadcom expected to release its second-quarter report. Wall Street is going to want details of how the chipmaker plans to remain competitive in mobile now that it has given up on building its own leading edge LTE chips. Separately, Xilinx, the programmable chipmaker, will likely post results slightly below consensus estimates, as sales from its aerospace, defense and wired telecom customers are expected to be flat in the quarter.    TD Ameritrade is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results that are expected to continue to be mixed, with a healthy growth in client assets, continuing low returns on client cash because of low rates and seasonally weak trading (June) trading revenue.     Intuitive Surgical looks to bounce back from a dismal first quarter that rocked shareholders accustomed to solid quarterly sales and earnings growth. Investors will be looking for signs that sales and use of the expensive da Vinci robotic surgical system have picked up after sales fell more than 20 percent in the first quarter, and for an updated forecast, including details of whether expansion of sales in Japan can help offset declines in the United States.   A sluggish housing recovery in the United States is likely to affect Ingersoll Rand’s second-quarter results. The company is likely to report lower orders for its climate controls business. Investors will be looking out for order numbers on the company’s commercial HVAC business. Johnson Controls HVAC business recorded a 4 percent decline due to lower orders from North America and Middle East in its third quarter    Juniper Networks’ first-quarter profit is expected to beat analysts’ expectations. The company has been benefiting from higher spending by U.S. telecom carriers on their network. Some analysts speculate that Juniper, which already undertook a round of job cuts this year, could slash more jobs.   Rockwell Collins, a supplier of avionics and other electronics for airplanes, is expected to report a lower fiscal third-quarter profit as it struggles to overcome weaker defense sales and lower equipment sales for business jets. Analysts expect profit of $1.17 a share, compared with $1.20 a year earlier.    CIT Group, the small business lender is expected to report a drop in second-quarter profit, hurt by lower net interest margins, as commercial and industrial lending market remains competitive. Analysts expect CIT to deliver strong loan growth in the long term, but margins to remain compress.   Gannett, the largest newspaper chain in the U.S., is expected to report its second-quarter results tomorrow as the print industry continues its struggle with declining ad revenue and readership. To counter that, Gannett has been bulking up its broadcast holdings which will likely prompt analysts and investors if the company will spin out its newspapers.   Peabody Energy, the coal miner is expected to report a second-quarter loss, compared with a year ago profit. Analysts expect output form Peabody’s North Goonyella Coal Mine in Australia to improve in the third quarter. Investors will look for comments on the impact of steel-making coal price cuts on the company’s forecast, which could be offset by improving thermal coal demand.   Asbury Automotive Group is expected to post a higher revenue and profit for the second quarter, as low interest rates and a brighter economic outlook drive U.S. new-vehicle sales.    Chemicals company DuPont is expected to post a lower second-quarter profit, hurt by weakness in its agriculture business. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Fund Management LP disclosed a stake in DuPont last year and the activist investor has called DuPont shares undervalued, but hasn’t made public his plans for the company.   PayPal, in conjunction with First Bank Nigeria, will launch the PayPal platform in the West African country.

488,KO,Coca-Cola sales miss estimates on flat North America growth,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co is still grappling with a problem even as sales of traditional Coke rise in North America: U.S. consumers are drinking less diet soda.  The world’s largest soda maker said on Tuesday that global sales volume rose 3 percent in its second quarter, boosted by growth in sparkling beverages. Sales were helped in part by the fact that Easter fell in the second quarter this year.  But Coke reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue as sales volume in North America, its biggest market, was flat partly because of a decline in diet Coke sales. JP Morgan analysts had expected volume to be up 1 percent to 2 percent in North America, which accounted for 45 percent of total revenue in the second quarter. Coke’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said that while the drop in diet Coke sales had improved from the first quarter, “we recognize we have more work to do here.” Coke, like rival PepsiCo Inc, has been struggling with declining soda sales in developed markets like the United States as consumers become more health conscious.  In a conference call on Tuesday, the company attributed the slipping diet Coke sales to insufficient marketing, a shift toward natural sweeteners and consumer skepticism about the safety and quality of artificial sweeteners. One bright spot in the quarter: Sales volume of regular Coke rose 1 percent in North America. Kent cited demand for smaller packages of the product, which Coke has found to have generated more “brand love.” The company said that its still beverage volume in North America - which includes flavored water - grew 1 percent, although juices and juice drinks drew lower volume as Coke raised prices to cover higher commodity costs.  Shares of Coca-Cola, which also makes Sprite, Minute Maid and Powerade, fell as much as 4.2 percent to $40.61 in early trading and recovered to $41.17 by early afternoon. The stock, a Dow component, has slipped 0.3 percent this year. The Dow Jones industrial average has climbed about 3.3 percent so far this year. Stephen Powers, a beverage analyst at UBS in New York, called the results “mildly disappointing” in a research note, pointing out that global volumes slightly missed expectations and North American margins were not up as much as hoped.

Analysts on average had expected earnings of 63 cents per share, on revenue of $12.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

492,KO,UPDATE 2-Mexico's Coca-Cola Femsa reports lower second-quarter profit,"(Adds detail on sales volumes, sugary drinks tax) MEXICO CITY, July 23 (Reuters) - Mexican Coke bottler Coca-Cola Femsa said on Wednesday its second-quarter profit fell 4.6 percent in spite of higher sales as it faced restructuring charges and paid more interest on debt it took on to acquire businesses in Brazil. Femsa reported a second-quarter profit of 2.68 billion pesos ($206 million), compared to a profit of 2.81 billion pesos in the year-earlier period. The jump in revenue, an increase of 14.3 percent to 41.434 billion pesos, was helped by the company’s acquisitions of two bottlers in Brazil, Spaipa and Fluminense, and another Mexican bottler, Yoli. Those acquisitions also helped quarterly operating profit rise 11.7 percent to 5.742 billion pesos from 5.142 billion pesos a year earlier. Excluding those three acquisitions, however, sales volumes fell 1.5 percent. The company attributed that drop to price increases because of a new tax on sugary beverages in Mexico. Sales of fizzy drinks in Mexico have slumped this year since the government introduced junk-food and sugary-drinks taxes. Coke Femsa has said it expects sales volumes in Mexico to drop between five and seven percent this year as a result of the 1 peso (8 cents) a liter (34 ounces) tax on sugary drinks. Excluding the integration of Yoli, Coke Femsa said its revenue fell 2.1 percent in Mexico. Latin America’s No. 2 economy accounts for close to half of Coke Femsa’s total revenue, even after a string of acquisitions outside of Mexico in the last few years. Not all of Coke Femsa’s recent acquisitions had a positive effect on quarterly results. The company recorded a 100-million-peso loss related to its participation in Coca-Cola’s Philippines bottling operation and a bottler in Panama.

494,KO,"Facebook goes express to mega-cap status - now valued more than AT&T;, Coke","NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the days after its infamously mishandled initial public offering in May 2012, it looked as if Facebook would struggle to become a must-own for fund managers.  Now the company’s $190 billion market value makes it bigger than such bellwethers as Coca-Cola and AT&T.; It’s not a member of the Dow industrials, but if it were, it would be larger than two-thirds of that index’s 30 members.  Shares of the world’s No. 1 social network touched a record high of $76.74 on Thursday after earnings and revenues easily topped analysts’ forecasts, boosting its market value to nearly $194 billion. That ranks it 15th in the Standard & Poor’s 500 benchmark index, just below the $196 billion market cap of International Business Machines Corp.  “A 100-year-old company with real assets versus a company admittedly with virtual assets and they are trading at the same market cap – crazy,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. The speed of Facebook’s rise to mega-cap status is what’s notable. It took Apple Inc nearly three decades to achieve such a market value; Google Inc needed five years. Facebook has only been public for a little more than two years, and only joined the S&P; 500 seven months ago. Since S&P; Dow Jones Indices announced the addition on Dec. 11, Facebook shares have risen 54 percent. The gains represent a reversal of fortune for the social media company. After a botched IPO that infuriated investors in May 2012, the stock slumped, underperforming for 15 months before finally eclipsing its offering price of $38 in August 2013. Since then, Facebook shares have been unstoppable, doubling in less than a year. “People understand the world is moving to mobile, and when you look at the time spent on mobile, Facebook has the lion’s share,” said Walter Price, senior portfolio manager and managing director of the AllianzGI Global Technology fund, which owned more than a million shares as of June 30.  The firm has leveraged its position by selling put options, or negative bets on the stock, and buying more call options, or bets on the shares rising further. “This is a momentum stock you can put a P/E on,” Price said. Facebook’s rally has left e-commerce giant Amazon Inc in the dust. That company’s value peaked around $187 billion in January, but closed Thursday at $165 billion. Amazon reported disappointing results afterwards, which dragged down its stock by 7 percent, valuing the company around $153 billion. Facebook’s market cap is still dwarfed by the roughly $403 billion in combined market cap for the two classes of Google shares, arguably the most similar in terms of revenue generation. However, Facebook tops The Coca-Cola Co by about $15 billion and Disney by more than $40 billion. Apple, the S&P; 500’s most valuable company, needed nearly three decades before its market value finally rose to more than $190 billion, surpassing that level in late December 2009.  Google’s move was swifter. The company went public in August 2004, and posted a closing market value of more than $190 billion for the first time in October 2007, right around the S&P;’s peak before the financial crisis. That’s not to say there aren’t detractors. StarMine, a Thomson Reuters company, sees Facebook as more overvalued than 95 percent of the companies in its stock universe. Using expected growth rates over the next decade, StarMine puts an intrinsic value of $29 on the stock. It has a high price-to-earnings ratio of 42, more overvalued than 90 percent of the stocks StarMine tracks. However, the stock’s relentless march has left few willing to stand in its way. Investors betting on the stock falling have dried up. In August 2012, more than 80 percent of shares available for short bets were being borrowed by investors expecting the stock to drop, according to Markit. Now, just 0.4 percent of shares available are being used for short bets.   Of the 43 analysts with recommendations on the stock, 37 are “strong buy” or “buy” ratings, with six “hold” ratings.  “If you were looking to short names that were ridiculously overvalued and people were not even thinking the growth was going to continue, I wouldn’t put Facebook in that category,” said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco.  “That being said, do I buy Facebook here? From my perspective, I am a value investor - I wouldn’t get anywhere near it with a 10-foot pole.”          That acceptance of Facebook’s legitimacy as a successful and viable company makes the comparison to the classic names that now surround it on the market cap list more palatable. “In some respects, Facebook speaks to a demographic shift in the way retailing, social media and virtually every other component of people’s lives is being bundled,” said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York.  “Investors are starting to see the brilliance of this platform in ways that haven’t to date really captured the imagination of many.”  ",7242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-facebook-markets-analysis/facebook-goes-express-to-mega-cap-status-now-valued-more-than-att-coke-idUSKBN0FT2K720140724

496,KO,CORRECTED-China brands beat global rivals with tea toothpaste & pickled plums,"(Corrects figures in paragraph 3) By Adam Jourdan and Clare Baldwin SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, July 29 (Reuters) - With green-tea flavoured toothpaste and pickled plum juice, an army of Chinese retailers is tapping local tastes to whittle away market share from global rivals that are banking their future growth on the world’s second-largest consumer market. Senior executives at companies such as The Coca-Cola Co , Procter & Gamble Co and Colgate-Palmolive Co  are being forced to adapt as the challenge posed by local firms intensifies in a slowing economy. Last year, China’s 1.15 trillion yuan ($185.31 billion) consumer goods market grew at 7.4 percent annually, half the rate of three years ago, according to a report this month from Bain & Company and Kantar World Panel. In this tougher market, both local and foreign brands are targeting the same customers, and increasingly, the domestic firms are winning: nearly two-thirds of foreign brands surveyed lost market share in China last year, according to the report. “The good domestic brands are closing the gap really quickly and are able to play off the idea that they know how to develop something that a Chinese person is going to want,” said Ben Cavender, a principal at China Market Research Group. Understanding the needs of Chinese consumers has given local companies an edge. Privately owned Jiaduobao Group (JDB) makes canned herbal tea which it says can put out internal “fires”, playing on a concept in traditional Chinese medicine. The firm also sponsors a popular TV talent show, “The China Voice”. “Our campaign around ‘fearing internal fire’ has helped JDB herbal tea become the highest selling canned drink in China...,” said Wang Yuegui, a senior executive at the firm. JDB accounted for 6.1 percent of the soft drinks market in 2013 by value, up from 4.2 in 2009, according to data from consumer consultancy Euromonitor. Coca-Cola had 13.1 percent, while Pepsi had 3.9 percent. With a population of 1.2 billion and a rapidly expanding middle class, China is the largest consumer goods market after the United States and even with a slowing economy, remains key to the future of global brands. China’s economy is expected to grow at its slowest pace in 24 years this year, but that’s still 7.4 percent. The U.S. economy, by comparison, is expected to grow at just 1.7 percent. Many of the Chinese firms taking on the international conglomerates are little-known abroad, but their local know-how is helping them broaden their appeal at home. Hawley & Hazel, a joint venture owned by Colgate-Palmolive and its Hong Kong-based founders, makes Darlie toothpaste which leads the domestic market according to Kantar and Bain, playing to Chinese tastes with green tea and jasmine flavours. Another popular toothpaste brand is made by Yunnan Baiyao Group Co Ltd, which uses its history as one of the biggest and oldest traditional Chinese medicine makers in the country as a selling point. Taiwan-based drinks maker Tingyi Cayman Islands Holding Corp , which bottles and distributes PepsiCo Inc  products in China, also says it makes a point of developing traditional Chinese flavours such as snow pear and pickled plum. “There are a lot of things that Chinese prefer localized,” said Bruce Rockowitz, chief executive of Global Brands Group  and former CEO of global sourcing firm Li & Fung. “Foreign brands haven’t adapted well enough.” In a bid to fend off competition, market leader Coca-Cola launched small-sized products, which helped boost its China sales. It also offered shoppers discounts, like rival PepsiCo. Coca-Cola, however, saw its market share drop more than 3 percentage points to 13.1 percent last year, while PepsiCo Inc  fell 1.8 percentage points to 3.9 percent, according to Euromonitor data. Coca-Cola International president Ahmet Bozer said he was happy with the company’s 9 percent sales volume growth in China during the second quarter. “From a competitive standpoint, we are quite pleased,” he said on a conference call with reporters. Pepsi said in an email to Reuters that its China revenue grew by low double-digits in the second quarter. It also said its relationship with Tingyi and a research and development centre in Shanghai helped it develop products geared to the local market. Even traditional strongholds for foreign brands are under attack in China, including the market for infant milk formula. That market is one of largest and fastest growing, expected to be worth $25 billion by 2017, according to Euromonitor data. Global companies including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co , Nestle SA, Danone SA and Abbott Laboratories have long dominated the premium formula segment but they have increased tie-ups with Chinese partners and boosted domestic supply chains to protect their position. Chinese milk powder firms including Biostime International Holdings and Beingmate Baby & Child Food Co Ltd  increased their market share last year, helped by a food scare that hit foreign brands as well as government drives to consolidate the sector. In diapers, another area traditionally dominated by foreign brands, local firms are becoming more credible rivals, said a spokesman for Japanese diaper maker Kao. “The potential challenge from Chinese domestic manufacturers has grown remarkably,” he said.

498,KO,"Coke, Pepsi try to fatten bottom line with smaller servings","NEW YORK (Reuters) - About a year ago, Texas rancher George Krueger worried about his weight, and decided it was time to downsize - his Coke cans, that is. Like increasing numbers of U.S. consumers, Krueger bet that by switching from regular-sized soda cans to 7.5 ounce “mini”-sized ones, he could make a dent in his daily calorie intake. “It’s kind of a happy medium,” said the 62-year-old, who generally drinks a can a day, but sometimes goes for an extra one for more caffeine. “I can have my sweet fix but not feel guilty for having so much.” U.S. soft drink companies are betting that soda drinkers like Krueger and their willingness to buy smaller cans, even for a higher unit price, will be a potential antidote to weak sales as consumers shift away from sugary soft drinks. The mini-can is the latest move by food and beverage companies to boost their product offerings of smaller portion sizes that supposedly help consumers limit their caloric intake - even if there are signs that some end up reaching for another package or can. Mini can sales grew 3 percent in 2013 while the rest of the carbonated soft drink category dropped, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.  Coca-Cola (KO.N) and Pepsi PEP.N said the cans were one of the few bright spots in U.S. soda sales in their second quarter earnings calls last month. “Consumers are paying more and more attention to calories now,” said Simon Lowden, chief marketing officer at Pepsi Beverages North America, in a phone interview last week. While such concerns might have once helped diet drinks, growing health worries about artificial sweeteners have hurt that category, experts say.      Coke, the world’s largest soda maker, said there was double-digit growth in mini cans even while sales volumes of sparkling beverages in North America were flat. Smaller sizes, which include mini cans, accounted for more than 60 percent of the volume growth in traditional Coke. Pepsi’s mini can business in the United States has grown 24 percent year-to-date in 2014 and was up 34 percent last year. The company said that this year, it has also seen a significant increase in the number of in-store displays of mini cans. There’s still a lot of room for growth. In 2013, mini cans comprised just 3 percent of carbonated beverage cans sold in the U.S., according to Euromonitor International. Earlier this year, the mini can was featured for the first time in a television ad starring actor Cuba Gooding Jr. which ran during the Oscars, the second most visible time frame behind the Super Bowl, Lowden said. Even beer companies are experimenting in the U.S. with smaller packaging. MillerCoors, a U.S. joint venture between SABMiller Plc SAB.L and Molson Coors Co, (TAP.N) offers 7-ounce bottles of Miller High Life as well as 10-ounce cans of Redd’s Wicked Apple and Coors Light Summer Brew. Heineken has rolled out a new 8.5-ounce “slim” can, citing “explosive growth” in smaller sized cans in the international market.  The shift toward smaller cans “is almost the industry admitting that volume is not going to be growing very much,” said Ali Dibadj, a beverage analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.  It is one way that companies can drive higher prices and larger margins: Consumers may feel as though they’re buying a cheaper, smaller soda, but they are often paying more per fluid ounce, analysts said. Indeed, there is a price difference between mini cans and regular cans at retail. At a Fairway grocery store in Manhattan last week, 7.5-ounce cans of regular Coke and Pepsi were $4.49 for an eight-pack. Twelve-ounce cans, on the other hand were $4.89 for a 12-pack. That works out to roughly 7 cents per ounce versus 3 cents an ounce. Teresa Votaw, 47, of Sugar Land, Texas, doesn’t mind the higher prices. “I shop a lot at Whole Foods and am very particular about my children’s diet,” said Votaw. “I don’t want my kids drinking sugary drinks, but I don’t want them to be completely deprived.” Jennifer Harris, director of marketing initiatives at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, said that smaller package sizes can help reduce soda consumption. “Studies show that people drink whatever package it comes in,” she said.  That’s not necessarily the case with all food products, such as 100-calorie snack packs. A 2008 study by Arizona State University researchers found that dieters actually consumed more of the food in smaller packages than they would if it was regular sized. Krueger, the Texas rancher, hasn’t lost weight as a result of the mini cans but said they are likely keeping him from gaining more bulge. “If I was really sensible, I wouldn’t drink them at all, but I just love the taste,” he said.

500,KO,"UPDATE 2-Russia escalates economic battle with U.S., EU with food import ban","* Russia ban is in retaliation for Western sanctions * Putin orders food import curbs * Central bank warns bans will hurt inflation fight   (Recasts lead, adds comment from U.S. exporters) By Polina Devitt and Dmitry Zhdannikov MOSCOW, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Russia has escalated an economic battle set off by the crisis in Ukraine with a ban on all food imports from the United States and on fruit and vegetables from the European Union, dropping any pretence these might be for food safety reasons. The import ban, reported by state news agency Ria Novosti on Wednesday, comes after Russia President Vladimir Putin ordered retaliation for Western sanctions against Moscow. Russia is a major buyer of European fruit and vegetables but ranks 23rd among buyers of food from the United States, accounting for less than 1 percent of America’s agricultural exports. Putin signed a decree on Wednesday halting or limiting imports of agricultural products from countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia, ordering his government to come up with a list of imports to be banned for a year. “(All food products) that are being produced in the U.S. and being supplied to Russia will be banned,” Ria Novosti quoted Alexei Alekseenko, spokesman for the VPSS food standards agency, as saying. “Fruit and vegetables from EU will be covered by the total ban,” he added. No one was available for comment at the VPSS (Phytosanitary Surveillance Service), but earlier Alekseenko told Reuters that retaliatory action would be “quite substantial,” and include U.S. poultry. Russians have a strong appetite for U.S. chicken, buying 276,100 tonnes of it last year, or 8 percent of U.S. exports. A spokesman for the European Commission in Brussels said he had no immediate comment. Russians bought 21.5 percent of EU vegetable exports and 28 percent of the bloc’s fruit exports in 2011. The U.S. National Chicken Council and Poultry & Egg Export Council said it did not expect a great impact on the industry from the ban, while farmers said ordinary Russians could suffer. “This is clearly a political move. It is unfortunate that the biggest losers in this will be Russian consumers, who will pay more for their food now as well as in the long run,” said Bob Stallman, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. In the past, Russia has banned a variety of U.S. foods citing health and safety concerns, but Wednesday’s action makes  its language on terms similar to that of the United States and European Union, which have imposed sanctions on Moscow. Explicitly banning a country’s products for political reasons would violate the rules of the World Trade Organization, which Russia joined in 2012. After Putin issued his decree, the VPSS said it would discuss an option to increase food imports from Ecuador, Brazil, Chile and Argentina with the countries’ ambassadors on Thursday. Brazilian producers could send an additional 150,000 tonnes of chicken per year to Russia to make up the shortfall, Francisco Turra, president of the country’s animal protein association, ABPA, said in Sao Paulo. Washington and the EU first imposed sanctions after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March and tightened them after a Malaysian airliner was shot down last month over territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Moscow rebels. Moscow rejects Western allegations that the rebels used a missile it supplied to bring down the airliner, killing all 298 people on board. East-West relations soured yet further on Wednesday as NATO said Russia might use the pretext of a humanitarian mission to invade eastern Ukraine. Until now, smaller or poorer countries have featured prominently among those targeted by the Russian response. Moscow has already suspended beef and cattle imports from Romania, citing an outbreak of mad cow disease, and banned Ukrainian juice and dairy produce, Polish vegetables and Australian beef. Russia’s central bank warned that such bans on importing cheap products could make it harder to control inflation, which fell to an annual 7.5 percent in July, but remains well above the 6.5 percent rate in 2013.

501,KO,Finland fears sanctions crisis as Putin curbs food imports,"* Putin orders food import curbs in muted retaliation * Central bank warns bans will hurt inflation fight * Finland says EU must share burden of retaliation * Western bank still expects robust Russia profits * Coca-Cola cuts TV commercials in Russia By Sakari Suoninen and Dmitry Zhdannikov ESPOO, Finland/MOSCOW, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Finland warned on Wednesday that Russian retaliation against EU sanctions could push its economy into crisis, while President Vladimir Putin ordered curbs on food imports from countries that join the Western action over Ukraine. Despite the deepening crisis, Putin held back from imposing any broad ban or restrictions that might cause food shortages or risk stoking inflation. East-West relations, already at their worst since the Cold War, soured yet further on Wednesday as NATO said Russia might use the pretext of a humanitarian mission to invade eastern Ukraine. Although rhetoric levels are rising, Putin’s response to EU sanctions targeting Russia’s banking, energy and defence industry remains relatively muted. On Wednesday, he signed a decree banning or limiting imports of agricultural products from countries that have imposed the sanctions. Putin ordered his government to come up with a list of goods to be banned for one year, the Kremlin said. However, with the central bank warning that import restrictions could push up food prices and general inflation, Putin said the list should not hurt Russian consumers - who are fond of U.S. chicken pieces known as “George Bush’s leg”. Nevertheless, the prospect of tit-for-tat economic restrictions has raised concern among smaller European Union nations that have close trading ties to Russia. Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, said it feared a repeat of the turmoil suffered by most Western economies in 2008-09. “This has the potential - and I stress potential - to become Economic Crisis 2.0,” Prime Minister Alexander Stubb told reporters in the Finnish city of Espoo. Neutral Finland traded heavily with its huge neighbour even during the Cold War, and suffered badly when the Soviet Union collapsed almost a quarter of a century ago. Today, Russia is Finland’s third largest export market, while Russian tourists spend roughly 2 billion euros ($2.7 billion) a year in Finland. Stubb said he expected Moscow to retaliate but defended the sanctions, imposed after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in March and tightened after a Malaysian airliner was shot down over territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Moscow rebels. However, he made clear the burden of retaliation had to be shared among EU members: “If sanctions hit Finland disproportionately, we will seek aid from our EU partners.” So far, smaller or poorer countries have featured prominently among those targeted by the Russian response. Veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor said it was suspending beef and cattle imports from Romania, citing an outbreak of mad cow disease. Moscow has already imposed bans on Ukrainian juice and dairy produce, Polish vegetables and Australian beef, saying it might target Greek fruit and U.S. poultry. The central bank warned that bans on importing such cheap products could make it harder to control inflation, which fell to an annual 7.5 percent in July, but remains well above the 6.5 percent increase seen in 2013. Rosselkhoznadzor said Russia would look to other suppliers to compensate for the bans. “We are talking about a significant increase of meat and dairy imports from Brazil,” said Alexei Alekseenko, spokesman for the watchdog. The sanctions have effectively frozen Russian banks out of EU financial markets, and yet one Western bank active in Russia said it expected to keep making solid profits there despite losing some business. Bank Austria, the central and eastern European arm of Italian bank UniCredit, said its pretax profit in Russia rose 3 percent to 247 million euros in the first half of this year. That was more than a quarter of its total pretax profit, making Russia its most profitable market. Bank Austria said it would be able to keep raising money locally. “Given what we know now about sanctions, we assume that in Russia we will continue to have a very significant profit contributor. We feel we are set up well,” Chief Executive Willibald Cernko said. Federico Ghizzoni, UniCredit’s chief executive, also expressed confidence. “The bank seems strong enough to go through this storm,” he said in Milan. “This is not to say that we are not looking at the situation with concern, but there is no systemic problem,” he said, adding the bank estimated a hit of up to 10-15 million euros in lost revenues. In a research note, Berenberg analysts said UniCredit was among the European banks most exposed to Russia - whose economy is already teetering on the verge of recession. While the direct effect of sanctions would be limited, it said the indirect fallout could include weaker demand for Russian debt, and funding restrictions and deteriorating asset quality - meaning more Russian borrowers are likely to default on their loans. In a sign of the economic slowdown, soft drinks giant Coca-Cola Co said it had taken advertisements off four television channels there as a fall in second-quarter sales prompted a rethink of its marketing plans. Two of the channels named by the Russian business daily Kommersant are owned by St Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya, which is owned in turn by Yuri Kovalchuk, a close ally of Putin. Kovalchuk was hit by U.S. sanctions in March and blacklisted by the EU last month. However, a Coca-Cola spokeswoman said by email that “there is no political motive in this decision”.

502,KO,Coca-Cola takes ads off four Russian TV channels,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co confirmed on Wednesday it had taken advertisements off four Russian television channels, saying a fall in second-quarter sales had prompted a rethink of its marketing plans. Russian business daily Kommersant reported earlier that Coca-Cola had stopped placing ads on REN-TV, Channel Five, Domashny and Russia’s Defense Ministry’s channel Zvezda. The newspaper quoted sources saying this was probably linked to U.S. and European sanctions over Ukraine because a businessman hit by the Western measures is linked to three of the TV channels in question. Coca-Cola denied there was any political motive behind its decision to change its TV advertising. “As a result of the evaluation of Coca-Cola’s beverage sales  in the second quarter of 2014 in Russia, we have made a decision to change the plan of promotional activities on TV and focus on key federal channels and most efficient channels with regards to our target audience,” a company spokeswoman said by email. “There is no political motive in this decision,” she said. The first two channels mentioned by Kommersant - REN-TV and Channel Five - are part of the media holding company National Media Group, which is owned by Yuri Kovalchuk’s St-Petersburg-based Bank Rossiya. A close ally of President Vladimir Putin, Kovalchuk was hit by U.S. sanctions in March and blacklisted by the European Union last month. Washington said Kovalchuk had been targeted because he was a “personal banker” for Putin and other officials. Kovalchuk also owns a 25-percent stake in CTC Media, the parent of the Domashny Channel, through Bank Rossiya’s subsidiary Telcrest. Coca-Cola, however, pointed out that it had not withdrawn ads from the other two channels controlled by CTC Media - CTC and Peretz. The U.S. company said it would still be advertising on 13 Russian channels, after dropping the four. The company said in its second-quarter report last month that it saw a mid single-digit decline in Russian sales volumes and recorded a loss of $25 million related to restructuring its Russian juice operations. It had earlier predicted that volume growth in Russia would slow to “mid single digits” this year after high single digit volume growth previously. According to Kommersant, Coca-Cola is one of the biggest advertisers in Russia with annual spending of 2.5 billion roubles ($69 million), while rival Pepsico spent some 7 billion roubles on promotions in Russian media last year.

Under the agreement, Coke will have two directors on Monster’s board. Coke will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy business including NOS, Full Throttle and Burn, to Monster. Monster will issue Coke shares of common stock, and transfer its non-energy business, which includes Hansen’s Natural Sodas and Peace Tea, to Coke. Coke will become Monster’s preferred distribution partner globally, while Monster will become Coke’s exclusive energy drinks partner.  For Coke, the transaction represents an opportunity to increase its footprint in a faster growing category than soda. Coke said last month that its quarterly revenue in North America its biggest market was flat, partly driven by a decline in diet coke sales.

513,KO,"UPDATE 1-Buffett's Berkshire reveals Charter stake, cuts DirecTV","NEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed a new  $366 million stake in cable TV operator Charter Communications Inc and pared its holdings in two other pay-TV companies, part of a flurry of changes in its stock investments during the second quarter. Shares of Charter shares rose about 2 percent after-hours after Berkshire reported a new 2.3 million share stake, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that detailed its domestic equity investments as of June 30. Charter is “the play of choice on cable consolidation,” said Wunderlich Securities analyst Matthew Harrigan. “You’ve got a good story on an as-is basis and if they do more deals they can do a lot more value,” he said. DirecTV is awaiting regulatory approval to sell itself to AT&T; for $48.5 billion. Charter declined to comment. A message left with DirecTV was not immediately answered. Shares of companies often rise after Berkshire reveals new  investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett and try to copy him. Berkshire did not disclose whether the Charter investment was made by Buffett or one of his portfolio managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Buffett has said he generally makes Berkshire’s larger investments such as Wells Fargo & Co and Coca-Cola Co , while other investments, especially in sectors he is less familiar with, are often made by Combs or Weschler, who have smaller sums to invest. Within the pay TV sector, Berkshire said its stake in DirecTV fell by about 11 million shares since the end of March to 23.5 million. It is also no longer reporting any stake in premium TV cable network Starz. The sales of stocks contributed to a significant increase during the quarter in Berkshire’s cash pile, which ended June at $55.5 billion. That gives Buffett power to make at least one big acquisition and still retain his desired $20 billion cushion. In Thursday’s filing, Berkshire reported a new stake in Now Inc, an energy distribution business recently spun off from oilfield equipment provider National Oilwell Varco Inc , whose stock Berkshire also owns. Among the companies in which Berkshire reported higher share stakes were General Motors Corp, IBM Corp, Suncor Energy Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. It also reported lower holdings in many companies, including oil company ConocoPhillips, former Washington Post owner Graham Holdings Co, National Oilwell Varco, and former Starz owner Liberty Media Corp. U.S. regulators require large investors to disclose their stock holdings every quarter, and the disclosures can offer a window to their strategies for buying and selling stocks. Berkshire ended June with more than $119 billion of equities, about 90 percent of which are on U.S. exchanges. It also owns more than 80 businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance to railroads.

Wintergreen Advisors still owns 2.5 million shares of Coke. “We no longer felt that Warren Buffett was looking out for his shareholders’ interests,” Winters said in an emailed statement. Coke declined to comment. Berkshire did not return a phone call late Friday afternoon.

517,KO,Coke's Monster deal underlines caution on full-blown M&A;,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co’s (KO.N) $2.15 billion wager on a stake in Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O) highlights the growth-starved soft drink company’s embrace of deals that fall short of a full-blown merger and acquisition but allow it to test-drive potentially risky targets. The world’s largest soda maker said Thursday that it was  buying a 16.7 percent stake in Monster. Coke will get two directors on Monster’s board as well as Monster’s non-energy brands, such as Hansen’s Natural Sodas and Peace Tea. Monster will get Coke’s energy brands, which include NOS and Full Throttle, as well as access to Coke’s extensive distribution system.  Taking a minority stake instead of acquiring Monster outright gives Coke the opportunity to get the perks of being in  a $27 billion global energy drinks market without taking on the financial and public relations risks that come with the controversial category, analysts said. If the deal closes as expected, Coke will distribute energy drinks but will not actually own them anymore.  One advantage for Coke is that deal involves less cash upfront than a full-on acquisition, which would have been at least $12 billion at Thursday’s closing stock price. That is roughly equivalent to the amount of cash Coke had in hand at the end of July. “A couple of billion is something that Coke could handle without much difficulty,” said Linda Montag, senior vice president at Moody’s Investors Service.  Also, the gradualist approach allows Coke to sample at a distance a market in which it has a small presence and thus limited experience, with both the risks and rewards. The category enjoyed double-digit global growth in the mid-2000s, but as of late that has slowed. According to Euromonitor International, energy drink sales increased 7 percent in 2013 from the previous year.  There are other hazards with which Coke may want to get more familiar before doing a full deal. Energy drinks have been wrought with controversy in both the United States and international markets. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in 2012 that it was probing five deaths possibly linked to Monster Energy. The agency says it is still studying energy drinks but has not taken any action so far. Earlier this year, Lithuania banned the sale of high-caffeine drinks to minors, raising the question of whether other countries could follow its lead.  A Coke spokesman said Friday that the company has done its due diligence in evaluating Monster’s legal proceedings. The deal notably keeps Coke at an arm’s length from any future public relations battles facing the energy drinks industry.  “This is a category that faces ongoing scrutiny, fair or not,” said Stephen Powers, an analyst at UBS. “Coke has always been wary of that because they face a lot of scrutiny themselves.”  A deal between Coke and Monster has been speculated about for years. Coke shares were up 2 percent at $40.93 in Friday’s trading while Monster’s surged 30 percent to $93.07.  Indeed, a cautious approach does not necessarily mean the company is shutting the door on owning Monster some day. The company made investments in both Honest Tea and Zico Beverages, the maker of coconut water, before eventually buying them.  It could be pursuing a similar strategy with Keurig Green Mountain Inc GMCR.O: Coke bought a 10 percent stake in the single-service coffee brewing company earlier this year and raised it to 16 percent in May, making it Keurig’s largest shareholder.  “This seems to be an evolving and accepted method for Coke to diversify and do it in baby steps before they go all in,” Powers said.

The market continued to take its cue from news overseas. Ukrainian border guards crossed the frontier to inspect a huge Russian aid convoy, which some had speculated could be a cover for a military invasion. The inspection comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin struck a softer tone in comments regarding Ukraine. In Iraq, Nuri al-Maliki stepped down as prime minister, paving the way for a new coalition that world and regional powers hope will be able to quash a Sunni Islamist insurgency that threatens Baghdad. “While no one is discounting the possibility that these issues could get worse next week, there hasn’t been anything untoward yet with the inspections or in Iraq, and that’s a positive,” said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group in New York. In the latest economic data, the New York Federal Reserve’s report on manufacturers showed business conditions improved in August, though at a slower rate than expected.  Separately, U.S. consumer sentiment fell in August to its lowest since last November, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers. “These are disappointing, but there’s a growing feeling that the U.S. is going to be the best market to be in for the rest of the year,” Colas said. “U.S. equities look like a better value than U.S. Treasuries, or certainly European equities.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.05 points or 0.31 percent, to 16,764.63, the S&P; 500 gained 7.92 points or 0.41 percent, to 1,963.1 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 28.24 points or 0.63 percent, to 4,481.24. For the week, the Dow is up 1.3 percent, the S&P; is up 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq is up 2.5 percent.

521,KO,Coca-Cola pays $2.2 billion for major stake in Monster Beverage,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) said Thursday it is making a cash payment of $2.15 billion for a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O) as the world’s largest soda maker seeks to expand into faster-growing categories such as energy drinks. Under the agreement, Coke will have two directors on Monster’s board. Coke will transfer ownership of its worldwide energy business including brands like Full Throttle and Burn, to Monster. Monster will transfer its non-energy business, which includes Hansen’s Natural Sodas and Peace Tea, to Coke. Coke will become Monster’s preferred distribution partner globally, while Monster brands will be the only energy drinks distributed by Coke. For Coke, the transaction represents an opportunity to increase its footprint in energy drinks, a $27 billion market globally, according to Euromonitor International. It comes at a time when people are drinking less soda in developed markets. Coke said last month that its quarterly revenue in North America, its biggest market, was flat, partly driven by a decline in diet Coke sales.  In turn, Monster will gain access to Coke’s extensive global distribution system. The companies have a distribution agreement in the U.S. and Canada and will amend it to expand into additional territories. On a conference call with media, Rodney Sacks, chief executive officer of Monster, said that the company would also convert distribution agreements it has with Anheuser-Busch InBev in the U.S. to Coke.  “We believe it will be a win-win strategy” Sacks said.    A person familiar with the transaction said that the deal enables Monster to enter markets where it doesn’t have a presence, like China and Russia, and increase its footprint in places where the company thinks it can gain share, like Brazil. Coca-Cola shares rose 1.2 percent in after-hours trading, while Monster surged 22 percent.  Coke’s Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent said the company has the option to increase its stake to 25 percent and cannot exceed that amount in the next four years. Coke is under no obligation to make additional investments.  The transaction is expected to close late in 2014 or early in 2015.  The deal comes two years after Coke took the unusual step of shooting down a report by the Wall Street Journal that said it was in talks to buy Monster. Coke and Monster had discussed a possible deal as recently as 2011, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time.

524,KO,"UPDATE 1-Australia's Coca-Cola Amatil warns on profit, launches new products","* H1 net profit falls 15.6 percent to $169.50 mln * Strategic review report due end of October * New products include 250ml, A$2 Coke can   (Recasts, updates throughout with more detail, CEO and analyst comment, share price) SYDNEY, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Struggling Australian food and beverage company Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd (CCA) warned on Wednesday it expects to post a second consecutive drop in full-year earnings amid weak consumer confidence and thanks to a few management “own goals.” CCA is scrambling under new Chief Executive Alison Watkins to address the changing tastes of its core market, launching a smaller, cheaper Coke can and promising more sugar-free products. Still, those introductions will be too late for the current year, when it expects full-year profit to be “materially lower” than last year. In its first set of results under Watkins, the company revealed on Monday that first-half net profit slid 15.6 percent to A$182.3 million ($169.50 million), from A$215.9 million a year ago. That was largely in line with analyst expectations of A$184.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, but shares fell 2.9 percent as analysts focused on the weak earnings outlook. Watkins, who took the post in March, conceded the poor operational result was not entirely due to external factors like domestic price competition from Asahi Group Holding Ltd’s  Pepsi. “Some of that is due to market forces, some is due to what we can only describe as own goal factors,” Watkins said on a conference call. Decisions by the company last year to cut its sales staff and stand back from promotional activity in Australia were poorly made in hindsight, she said. CCA in February booked an 83 percent decline in annual net profit, its worst profit in 20 years. Watkins is overseeing a strategic review that seeks to restore brand value and save the company A$100 million in costs over the next three years partly by streamlining its supply business. The company is drawing up plans for more low and no-calorie drinks and on Wednesday unveiled a new 250ml, A$2 coke can - an attempt to gain leverage in Australia’s price wars. Further initiatives would be coming in the summer, Watkins said. “As a business, we have been slow to adapt to these changes in market conditions and shifting consumer trends,” Watkins said. Analysts said the first-half results were extremely disappointing and wanted to see more detail on the review, which is not expected until a scheduled analyst day in October. “Management is still in rebase mode and we recommend caution until it is clear this has come to an end,” Citi analyst Gino Rossi said in a note to investors. First-half earnings before interest and tax in Australia, which generates more than 80 per cent of profits, fell 14.1 per cent to A$226.5 million, while earnings in Indonesia plummeted 83.4 per cent to A$5.2 million. There has long been speculation that CCA’s 30 percent shareholder, The Coca-Cola Co, was keen to buy the business back from CCA or team up with a partner like Mexican bottler Coca-Cola FEMSA. But Watkins said on Wednesday CCA was committed to both Indonesia and its alcoholic beverages unit, which is unlikely to reach the 1 percent contribution to profit growth that had been flagged for this year. CCA returned to the beer market in December after a two-year break, but it said sales had been slower than expected due to increased competition. CCA shares were 2.9 percent lower at A$9.45 in mid-afternoon trade on the Australian stock exchange, off an intraday low of A$9.23. Shares have fallen around 22 percent since the start of the year, compared with an 4.8 percent rise in the S&P;/ASX 200 .

527,KO,An in-form Horschel two ahead at Tour Championship,"ATLANTA (Reuters) - Billy Horschel, seeking a second consecutive PGA Tour victory, birdied three of the last eight holes to move two strokes clear of the chasing pack in the Tour Championship second round on Friday. The American, ranked second in the FedExCup standings coming into this week, fired a second successive four-under-par 66 at East Lake Golf Club to seize control of the fourth and final playoff event with an eight-under total of 132. However, Northern Irish world number one Rory McIlroy was in hot pursuit after carding a best-of-the-day 65 in hot and humid conditions to soar into a three-way tie for second at six under. McIlroy has already enjoyed a brilliant 2014 campaign, clinching two major titles among four wins worldwide, and has now set his sights on claiming playoff honors on the U.S. circuit for the first time after a season-long race. “I just want to finish my season off the way I feel like I should and the way I feel like it deserves to be finished off,” McIlroy told reporters after piling up six birdies and a sole bogey with a sizzling display in the second round. “I’m not putting too much pressure on myself because it’s already been a great year, but I still want to win this thing.” Level with McIlroy at six under were Australian Jason Day (67) and American Chris Kirk (68), the FedExCup points leader who had been joint pacesetter with Horschel after the opening round. Horschel, who tied for second at the Deutsche Bank Championship two weeks ago and then won the BMW Championship on Sunday, did well to par the short 18th after hitting his tee shot into a greenside bunker and splashing out to seven feet. He coolly sank the par putt to end his day with an overall tally of six birdies and two bogeys, in pole position heading into the weekend with his sights set on victory and the staggering FedExCup playoff bonus of $10 million. “Drove the ball really well today,” said the 27-year-old Horschel, arguably the hottest player in the game. “Just didn’t hit very good chips, but played pretty solid coming in. Probably could have hit some better iron shots. “But I’m happy with the way I played today. I’ll take two more 66s, see where that puts me on Sunday.” Horschel, McIlroy, Kirk, Day and American Patrick Reed all held at least a share of the lead in the second round as the players jostled for position in the PGA Tour’s season-ending event. Kirk, who won the second playoff event earlier this month, slipped back with two bogeys in the first six holes but rebounded in style as he drained successive birdie putts from 26 feet at the seventh and eighth. He picked up another shot at the par-five ninth, where he sank an eight-footer, to join Day in a tie for the lead at six under, then knocked in a six-foot birdie putt at the 10th to edge a stroke in front. However Kirk stumbled with a three-putt bogey at the short 11th to drop back into a three-way tie at the top with Day and Horschel, who moments earlier had rolled in a 13-foot birdie putt on the 11th green. Day and Horschel both birdied the 14th to get to seven under, Horschel by draining a 25-footer, but the Australian faltered with a bogey at the last after missing the green to the right off the tee. McIlroy had ended his round with a birdie-birdie flourish for a brief share of the lead but Horschel moved two strokes clear at the top after hitting a superb approach to four feet at the 17th and knocking in the birdie putt. Any of the top five in the points standings would clinch the FedExCup by winning the Tour Championship - and that quintet comprises top-ranked Kirk, Horschel (second), Bubba Watson (third), McIlroy (fourth) and Hunter Mahan (fifth). Tee times for the second round were brought forward by three hours due to the threat of thunderstorms forecast for Friday afternoon.

528,KO,"McIlroy lurks after rare bounce, strong finish","ATLANTA (Reuters) - A bizarre bounce of his ball into a spectator’s pocket and an unexpected birdie-birdie finish helped Rory McIlroy surge into contention for the Tour Championship with a sizzling display in Friday’s second round. The world number one, hunting his fifth victory of the year worldwide, fired a five-under-par 65 on a steamy day at East Lake Golf Club to finish at six under, two strokes off the lead in the PGA Tour’s fourth and final playoff event. After sinking a nine-foot birdie putt at the 12th, McIlroy did well to par the 14th after his tee shot sailed into trees before the ricocheting ball ended up in the right-hand pocket of a spectator’s shorts. McIlroy shook hands with the bemused golf fan and shared a brief laugh with him before getting a free drop in the right rough, from where he hit his second shot to 20 feet and comfortably two-putted for par. The Northern Irishman then stunningly moved into a brief share of the lead with a birdie-birdie finish, sinking a 20-footer at the 17th before coaxing in a curling 27-footer at the uphill par-three last. “It was a really good way to finish,” four-times major champion McIlroy told reporters after mixing six birdies with a lone bogey to shoot the best score of the day. “I think it really started out when I made a good par putt on 16. “That kept the momentum of the round going,” he said of a 13-foot putt for par at the 16th. “Did exact same thing yesterday, was able to birdie 17. “And 18 was a bit of a bonus. I had a decent shot in there, but it was a pretty tricky putt up that hill with a lot of right-to-left breaks. I was trying to get it somewhere close to the hole. Once I hit it, I knew I had a chance. It dropped in.” McIlroy has already enjoyed a brilliant 2014 campaign, clinching two major crowns among his four wins, and has now set his sights on claiming FedExCup playoff honors, a title he has never won and has specifically targeted this week. Three strokes off the pace going into Friday’s second round at East Lake, he recorded three birdies and a bogey at the fourth, where he found a fairway bunker off the tee, to reach the turn in two-under 33. His bogey-free back nine, highlighted by his birdies at the 12th, 17th and the last, kept him in contention for the Tour Championship and the mind-boggling playoff bonus of $10 million. Giving McIlroy extra motivation this week is the fact that he narrowly missed out on FedExCup honors two years ago after he had arrived at East Lake heading the point standings following consecutive wins in the four-event playoffs. He ended up tying for 10th in that year’s Tour Championship, his only previous start in the elite limited-field event, and was edged out by tournament winner Brandt Snedeker in the race for the FedExCup. “It would be the icing on the cake,” McIlroy said of what a victory would mean to him after his impressive major victories at the British Open and PGA Championship. “Before coming into these FedExCup playoffs, having won four times in a season, two majors, a World Golf Championship, the flagship event on the European tour, it was going to be a great season anyway. “I wanted to cap it off in style and I’ve given myself a chance to do that over the next two days,” said the Northern Irishman, who trails pacesetting American Billy Horschel by two shots heading into Saturday’s third round. As for the fortunate bounce of his ball at the par-four 14th, McIlroy said it was the second time this year he has contended with a similar situation. “I hit it off someone’s leg at the Scottish Open in Aberdeen,” he grinned. “I need to stop hitting it off line. “I was happy,” McIlroy said of his adventure at the 14th on Friday. “That ball could have hit the tree and went anywhere. It hit up on the tree and ricocheted straight into his pocket. I just felt fortunate I was able to drop it there and make a par.” ",9122014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-mcilroy/mcilroy-lurks-after-rare-bounce-strong-finish-idUSKBN0H725G20140912
529,KO,$10 million takes precedence over labor day for Horschel,"ATLANTA (Reuters) - In-form American Billy Horschel has a great deal on his mind at this week’s Tour Championship, where a staggering playoff bonus of $10 million is up for grabs while he also prepares for the arrival of his first child. Horschel’s wife, Brittany, is scheduled to give birth in two weeks’ time but they have agreed that tournament golf and the chance to win FedExCup playoff honors will take precedence if their baby girl makes an earlier arrival than expected. “My wife and I are due two weeks from Saturday,” Horschel told reporters after charging into a share of the first-round lead at East Lake Golf Club with a four-under-par 66. “On the golf course I’m not thinking about it. “We have decided that if she (Brittany) goes into labor while I’m playing, I will just keep playing, because $10 million is a lot of money and I’m not going to pass that by. “And I’ll just fly home after the round and fly back (to the tournament) a couple hours later, spend some time with them.” Horschel, who rose to second in the FedExCup points list after finishing runner-up at the Deutsche Bank Championship two weeks ago and then winning the BMW Championship on Sunday, said he did not want to be notified while out on the course. “We’ve talked about that,” the 27-year-old explained after recording four birdies in a flawless display to end the opening round of the PGA Tour’s season finale level with fellow American Chris Kirk. “I’m going to stay put on the golf course. I’ll find out after the round. I won’t find out on the course, because my focus may be taken away from the task at hand. “But after the round’s over with, I will be flying home, spend a few hours and then fly back later that day or the next morning before the round of golf.” Asked whether he was more nervous about the baby’s impending arrival or the chance to win the Tour Championship and the FedExCup bonus of $10 million, Horschel replied: “I’m not too nervous about having a kid. My wife and I are very excited. “I’m just anxious for it to happen. I’m anxious for the baby to get here, our child to get here. And I’m anxious to have a chance to win $10 million. “Having a chance to win $10 million and our first child on the way, it’s pretty amazing, especially the time of year that it’s happening.” Horschel, one of only five players in the 29-man field at East Lake who is automatically guaranteed the overall FedExCup prize by winning the Tour Championship, is playing his sixth week in a row on the PGA Tour. Some players on a similarly busy run have cited fatigue as the season draws to a close but Horschel said he had “no issues with that” as he continued his bid for a third career title on the U.S. circuit. “Maybe it’s just the way that I take care of myself. I try to work out and do the right things, make sure I get enough sleep and everything else,” he said. “But, listen, this is the FedExCup Playoffs. If you can’t get yourself in shape and get up for it on a daily basis, then why are you playing this game? ‘It’s our playoffs. It’s like the World Series or the NBA Championships and NFL playoffs. You have to get up for it. It’s our postseason. We’re all tired and we all just gotta figure out how to put it out of our mind and go out and play golf.” ",9122014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-horschel/10-million-takes-precedence-over-labor-day-for-horschel-idUSKBN0H702320140912
530,KO,Late eagle lifts McIlroy into tie for lead,"ATLANTA (Reuters) - Rory McIlroy spectacularly eagled the par-five 15th to join Billy Horschel in a tie for the lead in the Tour Championship  on Saturday and set up a thrilling conclusion to the 2013-14 PGA Tour season. With the FedExCup playoff title and a bonus jackpot of $10 million on the line at East Lake Golf Club, world number one McIlroy sank a 26-foot putt to draw level at the top, then parred the last three holes to card a three-under-par 67. That left the Northern Irishman at nine-under 201 in the fourth and final playoff event, level with his American playing partner Horschel, who had been three ahead at the turn before losing momentum over the closing stretch on the way to a 69. McIlroy has already enjoyed a superb 2014 campaign, clinching two major titles among four wins worldwide, and has set his sights on claiming the FedExCup crown for the first time after a season-long race. “I haven’t played my best golf by any stretch this week, but I’m just sort of grinding out scores and trying to keep myself at the top of the leaderboard,” McIlroy told reporters after carding three birdies, his timely eagle and two bogeys. “Being tied for the lead going into the last day tomorrow with the way I’ve played this week, I can’t really ask for any more,” said the 25-year-old, who twice three-putted for bogey during the third round. “I feel like I’ve had the best year out of anyone on Tour and I’ve came here with the ultimate goal of trying to cap it off, trying to put an exclamation point on it.” Horschel is also seeking to end his season with a flourish, having tied for second at the Deutsche Bank Championship earlier this month before winning the BMW Championship six days ago. “It was like two different nines today,” said Horschel, who mixed three birdies with two bogeys. “I played really good on the front side ... but after that I was holding on to the reins pretty tight. “But I was able to keep it together, battle and turn in a number that I can be somewhat happy with and put me in a great position going into Sunday.” Veteran American Jim Furyk, who has not triumphed on the PGA Tour since his 2010 victory at the Tour Championship, was alone in third place at seven under after firing a four-birdie 67. English world number five Justin Rose (66), American young gun Rickie Fowler (67) and Australian Jason Day (70) were a further stroke back on a high-quality leaderboard after charging into contention on what is traditionally known as ‘Moving Day’. Horschel, two ahead of his closest pursuers overnight, had his lead briefly cut to one when first Day and then McIlroy birdied the opening hole on a steamy afternoon in Atlanta. However, both Day and McIlroy bogeyed the par-three second where Horschel drained a bomb, a 50-foot birdie putt giving him a three-stroke cushion. McIlroy rebounded by sinking a 22-foot birdie putt at the third but Horschel regained a three-shot lead when he struck a superb approach to six feet at the par-four eighth and knocked in the putt. Both players birdied the par-five ninth after reaching the green in two and two-putting for Horschel to reach the turn in three-under 32, three ahead of the chasing pack at 11 under. Horschel dropped his first shot of the day at the 10th, where he missed the fairway off the tee and failed to reach the green in two, but McIlroy also bogeyed the hole, three-putting from long range, to remain three shots adrift. After lipping out with a birdie attempt from 16 feet at the 11th, Horschel found a bunker off the tee and also with his approach to bogey the 13th and slip to nine under. McIlroy then upped things a gear, almost reaching the green in two at the 15th before draining the eagle putt from just off the fringe to join Horschel in a two-way tie at the top. Watched by the largest galleries of the day, they parred the last three holes to remain at nine under, each of them staying on track for the biggest payday of their respective careers.  Any of the top five in the points standings would clinch the FedExCup by winning the Tour Championship, a group that comprises top-ranked Chris Kirk, Horschel (second), Bubba Watson (third), McIlroy (fourth) and Hunter Mahan (fifth).

532,KO,Fitch Rates Coca-Cola's $2B Notes Issuance 'A+',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The  Coca-Cola Company's (Coca-Cola) issuance of EUR2 billion senior notes including  EUR800 million of 1.125% notes due 2022 and EUR1.2 billion of 1.875% notes due  2026. The Rating Outlook is Negative. Coca-Cola had approximately $40.2 billion  of debt as of June 27, 2014. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of  this release.  The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with the company's  senior unsecured obligations. Coca-Cola will use the net proceeds from the  offering for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital,  capital expenditures, acquisitions of or investments in businesses or assets,  redemption and repayment of short-term or long-term borrowings and purchases of  our common stock. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong Global Brands Coca-Cola's ratings are supported by its position as the world's largest global  beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has 17 $1  billion brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute Maid,  and Dasani. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's  beverage portfolio, the ratings consider the multiyear decline in CSD volumes in  the U.S., growing scrutiny over artificial sweeteners affecting diet CSD demand  in North America, and modest CSD growth in other developed countries. However,  this risk is mitigated by Coca-Cola's market strength in developing, higher  growth geographies with low per capita consumption characteristics that should  provide an important longer-term offset. Debt Structure, Elevated Leverage Fitch remains concerned with Coca-Cola's high gross leverage that has been  elevated by substantial commercial paper (CP) balances. Coca-Cola's gross  leverage is weak for the rating category at 3.0x on a total debt-to-operating  EBITDA basis for the second quarter ending June 27, 2014, up from 2.4x at the  end of 2012. FFO adjusted leverage was 3.9x and FFO fixed charge coverage was  14.8x.  Coca-Cola's commercial paper (CP) balance remains substantial at $19.9 billion  as of June 27, 2014. The CP mix is approximately half of the firm's overall  capital structure which Fitch believes increases Coca-Cola's financial risk.  Coca-Cola has indicated that $20 billion is the upper limit for its CP program.  The growth in CP balances results from Coca-Cola's mismatch between its U.S.  cash outflows and its significant international cash inflows which the company  has not felt a need to repatriate at this time. Coca-Cola maintains a comparable  cash balance along with its committed bank lines to provide backup to its CP  borrowings. Fitch believes Coca-Cola should advance a longer-term plan to  address the structural mismatch and the large CP balance including any reduction  in cash matching any corresponding reduction in CP levels, thus lowering gross  debt.  Strong Cash Generation, Liquidity Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to consistently generate  considerable cash flow from operations (CFFO) and free cash flow (FCF). For the  LTM period ending June 27, 2014, Coca-Cola generated $11.1 billion and $3.5  billion (after adjusting for dividends) of CFFO and FCF, respectively, after  generating $10.6 billion and $3.3 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012. Fitch expects Coca-Cola's FCF in 2014 to be in excess of $3.5 billion driven in  part by reduced pension contributions and improved working capital. Coca-Cola  has committed to $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net share repurchases in 2014,  after repurchasing a net $3.5 billion in 2013. Net share repurchases was $1.3  billion for the first half of 2014. LTM dividends were $5.1 billion representing  a cash flow payout ratio of 59%. Coca-Cola's long-term debt maturing in the next  12 months was $1.5 billion. As of June 27, 2014, Coca-Cola's $27.9 billion liquidity position consisted of  $18.1 billion of cash and short-term investments, $3.5 billion of marketable  securities, and $6.3 billion of availability under its committed credit lines  and revolving credit facility that mature August 2019. As part of Fitch's  corporate policy, off shore cash is viewed as not readily accessible due to a  general reluctance of firm's to repatriate because of incremental tax cost  although Fitch recognizes the significant cash balances that back Coca-Cola's CP  program is a key mitigating ratings factor.  Consistent Operating Performance Coca-Cola has demonstrated good execution and resiliency in the past with  top-line and cash flow growth driven by increasing volume, price/mix and  improved operating expense leverage. Persistent global macroeconomic pressure,  higher taxes, negative perceptions of artificial sweeteners and weather-related  issues has made past volume growth more challenging. During the six-month period  ended June 27, 2014, consolidated net operating revenue excluding the negative  effects of currency and structural changes grew 3%. Concentrate volumes rose 1%  while price/mix contributed 2%. Operating income increased 6% excluding the  impacts of currency and structural changes. Coca-Cola's first half 2014  performance was in line with Fitch's expectations.  Coca-Cola's expectations for an incremental $1 billion in productivity savings  by 2016 that will be primarily redirected for increased media investments should  further support brand development. M&A; Investments The ratings also consider the potential for future acquisitions given the  company's transaction history. Fitch views KO's investments in minority  positions of Monster Beverage and Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. as relatively low  risk and having key strategic benefits of improving product diversification and  distribution. The shifting secular trends within the soft drink industry make  these investments essential to create an additional avenue for growth.  Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) Ratings Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and CCR  issued obligations, since default risk is very low at this level on the rating  scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to the notes issued by Coca-Cola. Fitch currently rates The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its subsidiaries as  follows: The Coca-Cola Company --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Bank credit facilities 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --CP 'F1'.

534,KO,"Horschel wins Tour Championship, $10 million bonus","ATLANTA (Reuters) - Billy Horschel took the limelight from world number one Rory McIlroy to win the biggest title of his career at the Tour Championship on Sunday, along with FedExCup honors and an eye-popping $10 million bonus. Tied for the lead overnight with Northern Irishman McIlroy in the PGA Tour’s season-ending playoff event, American Horschel held his nerve to triumph by three shots, clinching his third career victory on the U.S. circuit and second in two weeks. Helped by a clutch par-saving putt from 30 feet on the 16th hole, the in-form Horschel signed off with a two-under-par 68 on a damp day at East Lake Golf Club for an 11-under total of 269. “I’m on cloud nine, it’s unbelievable,” Horschel said after being presented with the Tour Championship and FedExCup trophies by PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem. “It’s just unbelievable, everything that’s happened the last two weeks, and especially having a kid on the way. I’m not sure life can be better than this.” Horschel’s wife, Brittany, is scheduled to give birth to their first child in two weeks’ time. McIlroy, seeking his fourth PGA Tour win of the year, fell out of contention with a double at the sixth and three consecutive bogeys from the ninth before closing with a 71, tying for second with American Jim Furyk (69). “It was a week too far,” McIlroy told NBC Sports after competing in his eighth tournament in a hectic 10-week run. “I was making mistakes that I don’t normally make. But Billy deserved it. He played the best golf.” Horschel, one of five players who came into the tournament knowing that victory would automatically secure him the prized playoff crown, mixed three birdies with a lone bogey on Sunday to keep his closest challengers at bay. The 27-year-old American ended his season with a spectacular flourish, having tied for second at the Deutsche Bank Championship earlier this month before winning last week’s BMW Championship outside Denver. Furyk made a sizzling start to the final round on a cool and overcast afternoon at East Lake, birdies on the second and third holes lifting him briefly into a three-way tie at the top with McIlroy and Horschel. However McIlroy and Horschel made matching birdies at the par-four fourth to move one stroke clear, McIlroy sinking an 18-foot putt after missing the fairway off the tee and Horschel holing out from 11 feet. MCILROY DOUBLE-BOGEY Horschel edged one ahead by draining an 18-footer to birdie the par-four fifth, and was then handed a two-stroke lead when McIlroy double-bogeyed the tricky par-three sixth after dumping his tee shot into water. Furyk trimmed Horschel’s advantage by one with a birdie at the par-five ninth before faltering with a bogey at the 10th and McIlroy again stumbled with a bogey at the ninth after hitting a wild tee shot that sailed way right. Horschel, who had reached the turn with a two-stroke cushion at 11 under, made his first mistake of the day with a bogey at the 10th where he ended up in the right rough both off the tee and with his second shot. McIlroy also bogeyed the hole after three-putting, missing a three-footer for par, to slide four strokes off the pace. Furyk joined Horschel in a tie for the lead at 10 under after very nearly holing out with a delicate chip from greenside rough for eagle at the par-five 15th, settling instead for a tap-in birdie. But Horschel responded with a birdie of his own at the 15th, getting up and down from a greenside bunker to edge one stroke clear. Just when it seemed that Horschel would bogey the par-four 16th, where his tee shot sailed right into trees from where he could only punch his second out on to the fairway, he sank an uphill 30-footer to save par before pumping his fist in relief. Furyk gave Horschel welcome breathing space and a two-shot advantage when he bogeyed the par-four 17th after ending up short of the green in two. “This one, Billy was out ahead,” said Furyk, who also bogeyed the final hole and has not won on the PGA Tour since his victory at the 2010 Tour Championship.  “I was trying to chase him down all day. I just couldn’t make enough birdies.” Horschel, playing in the final pairing right behind Furyk, narrowly missed a birdie attempt from 15 feet at the 17th before comfortably parring the last to seal a three-stroke triumph.

The newly-formed group, called The CEO Council on Health and Innovation, said it came together “to lead the U.S. business community” in improving employee and community health and reducing costs. The council’s members also include Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), Aetna Inc (AET.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Walgreen Co WAG.N, McKinsey & Co, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association and the Institute for Advanced Health. Combined, the group said its healthcare benefits cover 150 million people. In a report released at a press conference in Washington, D.C. in conjunction with the Bipartisan Policy Center, the council called on employers to accelerate the adoption of wellness programs to improve nutrition and weight management, promote physical activity, help employees quit smoking and manage chronic diseases.

The company’s sugary soft drinks have been the target of public health advocates who argue they contribute to obesity and related diseases such as diabetes. Workplace wellness programs, a $6 billion-a-year industry, are popular because they promise to improve productivity, cut absenteeism and reduce medical costs by averting expensive illnesses.  Some employers, including Bank of America, offer financial incentives for employees to get screened, while others have begun to penalize workers who don’t participate in wellness requirements. Despite the rising popularity of such programs, some independent research has shown that wellness campaigns do not always cut costs as hoped.

538,KO,White House partners with industry to tackle greenhouse gas,"WASHINGTON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday announced steps to tackle a potent greenhouse gas used in refrigeration and air conditioning, of which the United States is the world’s largest producer, a week ahead of a major UN summit focused on addressing climate change. The Obama administration unveiled a batch of voluntary private sector commitments and executive actions to phase out the use of  Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which would result in the equivalent reduction of 700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide through 2025. Industry leaders from companies such as Coca Cola, Dupont, True Manufacturing and Honeywell attended an event at the White House on Tuesday where they pledged to invest in the next generation of HFC alternatives and to adopt more climate-friendly technologies. HFCs are factory gases that were used to replace ozone-depleting substances in air conditioning, insulation and refrigeration. Support is now growing to phase them out under the UN’s Montreal Protocol. They are 10,000 times more potent than the most prevalent greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and are growing at a rate of up to 15 percent per year. “Today’s commitments and actions demonstrate significant U.S. leadership in advance of the United Nations Climate Summit next week and build on progress made earlier in the Administration,” the White House Council on Environmental Quality said in a statement. They will also help build momentum for an amendment to the Montreal Protocol to phase down the use of HFCs. Additional announcements on HFCs are expected to be announced at the UN Secretary General’s Climate Summit in New York City on Sept. 23, according to the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development. “This is another important step by the White House in their effort to capture the biggest climate prize in near term by the phasing down of HFCs under the Montreal Protocol, a strategy now supported by over 100 countries,” said Stephen Andersen, Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will carry out some of the executive actions announced by the White House. It will require companies to list additional fluorinated and non-fluorinated chemicals as acceptable alternatives, identify refrigerant management options to reduce HFCs from air conditioning and refrigeration equipment and set up sector-specific workshops on phasing out HFCs. Industry also announced new investments and measures on phasing out HFCs. Stephen Yurek, president of industry group the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute announced the industry will invest $5 billion in research and development over the next decade to develop the next generation of refrigerants. Individual companies also made voluntary pledges Tuesday. Coca Cola  set a goal for all of its newly purchased cold drink refrigerators to be HFC-free. It currently has more than 1 million units in use throughout the globe. Rival PepsiCo said it will begin buying new HFC-free equipment starting in 2015 with a goal to be HFC-free by 2020. DuPont, which invented fluorinated refrigerants, announced its new products would reduce the greenhouse gas content of refrigerants by 90 million tons carbon dioxide equivalent in the U.S., and 245 million tons worldwide by 2025.

539,KO,Medinah motivation could backfire on U.S.: Rose,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The ploy by the United States to draw extra motivation from a stinging loss to Europe at Medinah two years ago could prove to be “a double-edged sword” for them at next week’s Ryder Cup in Scotland, Justin Rose told Reuters. U.S. captain Tom Watson has already pinpointed that 2012 defeat outside Chicago as a focal point for his team, saying the Americans will be driven to make amends for one of their most harrowing experiences in the biennial competition. “It could be very powerful, and it could be exactly the right thing to do — or it could lead to a lot of frustration if they get off to a bad start,” Englishman Rose said of the U.S. tactic. “Either way, it’s a ploy, it’s a tactic that is probably the right one but if the Europeans can get an upper hand, it’s going to feel very similar to what they have faced probably the last 10, 15 years,” the world number five added. The Americans have had very little to celebrate at the Ryder Cup over the past 20 years, losing seven times in the last nine editions with their most recent victory coming on home soil at Valhalla in 2008. At Medinah, they were seemingly poised to clinch a rare win when leading by four points going into the last-day singles, but the Europeans pulled off one of the greatest team comebacks on a golf course to triumph by 14-1/2 points to 13-1/2. “I can tell you that all the players I have talked to, every one of them without a doubt, had one thing to say about the Ryder Cup,” Watson said earlier this month about what came to be known as the ‘Meltdown at Medinah’. “They want to go back and make amends for what happened at Medinah. Our team has that one focus. The Europeans played great in the last round in 2012 and that was a hard loss for the American players and it still sticks with a lot of them.” The hosting Europeans, who have four of the top six ranked players in the world in their 12-man lineup, are being billed heavy favourites for the Sept. 26-28 matches at Gleneagles. Former U.S. Open champion Rose, however, does not buy into the notion of Ryder Cup favourites and underdogs. “We’ve got a good team and we believe in our team but I think the U.S. has a good team with some naturally strong pairings and partnerships,” said the 34-year-old, who will represent Europe for a third time in the competition. “The last two Ryder Cups have come down to one point, each time, so I don’t really buy into favourites, I don’t really buy into all of that stuff. “It’s going to be the team who wants it the most on the week and is prepared to dig deep for it that I think is going to be the team that wins. There will be no false sense of security from the Europeans’ point of view.” Rose is especially thrilled by the prospect of competing in his first Ryder Cup on European soil, having made his debut on a losing team at Valhalla in 2008 before savouring success at Medinah two years ago. “I am really excited,” said the Englishman, who has achieved an impressive win-loss-half record of 6-3-0 at the Ryder Cup where he is unbeaten in the singles, having twice beaten Phil Mickelson. “It’s going to be my first Ryder Cup playing in front of a home crowd and hopefully the energy of that will really spur me on at Gleneagles.” ",9182014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-ryder-rose/medinah-motivation-could-backfire-on-u-s-rose-idUSKBN0HD07R20140918
540,KO,"All the Americans will be gunning for McIlroy, says Monty","GLENEAGLES Scotland (Reuters) - World number one Rory McIlroy will have a metaphorical target on his back at this week’s Ryder Cup in the same way Tiger Woods did in his heyday, according to Europe’s triumphant 2010 captain Colin Montgomerie. Montgomerie believes all 12 members of the United States team will relish the chance of claiming McIlroy’s scalp if they are drawn against the British Open and U.S. PGA champion in the foursomes, fourballs or singles matches. “Rory is the one player that America wants to play because they’ve nothing to lose,” the 51-year-old Scot told the Daily Express newspaper on Monday. “It was a bit like that for us against Tiger. When we did draw him we would say ‘Game on, I’ve got a chance here. “If he beats me he’s supposed to beat me, if he doesn’t, well, what a day for me and what a day for the team.” Montgomerie, who also featured in eight Ryder Cups as a player, said European captain Paul McGinley may be tempted to “hide” McIlroy in the opening foursomes or fourballs on Friday and Saturday. “I think a lot of pressure is on Rory’s shoulders,” explained the eight-times order of merit winner. “If the rest of the team see Rory winning it gives them confidence. “If the team see Rory losing in one of the first groups then it’s difficult to think ‘we’ve got to pick up the pieces’ so it’s a huge temptation to hide him away. “You don’t want to put your main star out at number one because the rookies in the American team can play and any one of them can score a 66 and win,” said Montgomerie who is Europe’s third highest Ryder Cup points scorer of all time with 23 1/2. “I would definitely be for hiding Rory the way Tiger was many times. We expected him at number one in the singles in 2006 for instance when America were well down at the K Club and he turned up at number four.” ",9222014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-ryder-mcilroy/all-the-americans-will-be-gunning-for-mcilroy-says-monty-idUSKCN0HH1EV20140922
541,KO,"McIlroy will love being top dog, says mind coach","GLENEAGLES Scotland (Reuters) - The U.S. team have made no secret of the fact they are gunning for Rory McIlroy at this week’s Ryder Cup but the world number one will lap up the challenge, according to his mind coach Dr Bob Rotella. Visiting captain Tom Watson told reporters on Monday that it always boosts the confidence of a side “whenever you beat the stud on the opposing team”. Rotella, however, said McIlroy would use the comment as an extra incentive to perform well for holders Europe when the biennial event gets underway with Friday morning’s fourballs. “Rory has a great attitude about it,” Rotella told Reuters in a telephone interview from his home in Charlottesville, Virginia. “He will embrace it. “I think he is very comfortable with being the top dog and he’s going to enjoy the experience. The more people talk about how badly they want to beat him, the more he’ll relish it and use that to take pressure off himself. “The way Rory has played recently he’s very comfortable with high expectations and people putting pressure on him. That’s why he’s the number one player in the world.” The 65-year-old American said four-times major winner McIlroy would also be able to share the burden of being the figurehead of the European team behind the scenes. ""My guess is that one advantage Rory is going to have is that he won't have to be the leader in the locker room,"" added Rotella who is an ambassador for sports bookmaker Betway (betway.com). “Europe have players like Sergio Garcia, Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter who have all been around a long time and had a lot of success. “They will be the team leaders,” said Rotella. “Rory will be talked about and he’ll be the star player but I think it will help him in that he won’t have to be the team leader between matches. “That’s very different to what we’ve had with Tiger Woods over here.” Rotella, who also operates as a performance coach and has worked with nine of the 24 players who will be doing battle at Gleneagles, said British Open and U.S. PGA champion McIlroy’s easy-going personality would be his biggest ally. “All Rory has to do is go out there and play great golf,” he added. “The fact is that he enjoys his team mates, he gets along with everybody and he’s great with the media. “If you look at him in interviews he’s a lot more open and comfortable than some of our top players have been. I think he’ll handle everything just fine,” said Rotella. “If he gets beaten it will be because the other man has played better, not that he has beaten himself or didn’t handle the pressure.” Former world number one Woods is missing this week after declaring himself unfit following back surgery but the 14-times major champion has a mediocre Ryder Cup record and has only once been on the winning side. Rotella, who has coached the winners of 74 major championships in men’s, women’s and senior golf since 1984, said the U.S. may benefit from the absence of Woods. “The Americans are going to have to embrace the fact they are underdogs for the first time,” he added. “Some of them will feel less pressure because Tiger is not on the team. “All of them will remember the last time Tiger was not on the team that we won,” said Rotella in reference to the victory at Valhalla, Kentucky in 2008. “That’s an omen and I think it will take some pressure off. If we win without Tiger it will be an incredible accomplishment. “Some of them may think they’ve taken it too seriously and got too worked up about it all and they will say, ‘I’m just going to go and have some fun’,” said Rotella.

545,KO,CORRECTED-India's Modi promises U.S. CEOs a return to market reforms,"(Corrects day of U.N. speech to Saturday from Friday) By James B. Kelleher Sept 29 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told nearly a dozen U.S. company chiefs on Monday that he is committed to liberalizing his country’s economy, which has underperformed other emerging markets recently after years of breakneck growth. Modi spoke at a breakfast with 11 chief executive officers during his first U.S. visit since coming came to power in May, vowing to get India’s economy back on track. The prime minister was headed to Washington for a private working dinner with President Barack Obama on the fourth day of the visit. Modi, however, is fasting. Among those attending the breakfast at the New York Palace Hotel were the CEOs of Caterpillar Inc and Boeing Co . “He wasn’t at all like the politicians we’re used to here,” said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Doug Oberhelman, who shared his impressions of the breakfast meeting with Reuters. “He acknowledged that the last five years have been very difficult for the Indian population, the Indian economy and the world in general, and he vowed and promised to change that. I believed him. He was very serious. ... I was genuinely quite impressed.” However, some U.S. business groups have questioned Modi’s reformist credentials. Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 15 other business associations representing various sectors gave a more cautious assessment of the prime minister’s record so far. Modi also alarmed some foes of government tinkering with business last week when he said in India that multinational soft-drink giants PepsiCo Inc and Coca-Cola Co  should help increase sales by Indian farmers by adding fresh fruit juices to their fizzy drinks. In a letter to Obama, the U.S. business groups urged the president to press Modi to remove barriers to trade when the two leaders meet on Monday and Tuesday The letter highlighted India’s blockage of a key World Trade Organization agreement reached last year, which overshadowed a July 30-Aug. 1 visit to India by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. The business alliance also complained about India’s raised tariffs and “burdensome” new testing requirements on imported information and communication technology products. Last week, U.S. congressional leaders on trade and finance wrote to the U.S. International Trade Commission calling for a second investigation into India’s “unfair” trade practices, detailing any changes under Modi. In a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank on Monday before heading to Washington, Modi reiterated India’s WTO stance, saying that while India supported the trade pact, its demands for food stockpiles were not incompatible with it. He stressed his campaign to encourage manufacturing in India and the country’s desire for U.S. research and technology, something U.S. firms have been reluctant to share without stronger Indian intellectual property protections India, which once seemed to vie with China for the title of fastest-growing developing economy, has stumbled in recent years as a spate of scandals undermined business confidence in the government’s commitment to economic reform. Still, Modi had won the confidence of at least one other high-profile U.S. CEO even before the U.S. visit. Cisco Systems Inc Chief Executive John Chambers last week praised him as a leader who had “captured the imagination” of Indian business, adding that he would make the needed “tough decisions” to revive the company’s economy. One of Modi’s priorities on this trip is to gather more such endorsements and - judging from Oberhelman’s reaction - he won some more converts at Monday’s CEO breakfast. “I deeply believe that he’s committed to changing India,” Oberhelman said. “There’s no question that part of his mission is to enhance and increase the investment climate in India, both for domestic companies and for direct investment.” Caterpillar is the world’s largest maker of earthmoving construction and mining equipment. The Peoria, Illinois-based company operates several plants and research and development centers in India and - together with its two independent dealers - employs more than 10,000 people there. Monday’s events follow three momentous days for India’s new leader. On Saturday, Modi addressed the United Nations General Assembly, taking a jab at Pakistan over the disputed region of Kashmir. That evening, he appeared before some 60,000 people at a musical event in New York’s Central Park aimed at ending global poverty and bringing essentials such as sanitation to all. And on Sunday, the prime minister received a rapturous welcome from Indian-Americans in an appearance in New York’s Madison Square Garden arena. It was all a far cry from 2005, when the former chief minister of Gujarat was denied a U.S. visa over rioting in his home state that killed more than 1,000 people, mainly Muslims, three years before. Modi, who denies wrongdoing, has been exonerated by an Indian Supreme Court probe.

547,KO,"Coca-Cola, bowing to pressure, amends employee equity plan","(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co, facing criticism from Warren Buffett and other investors for its outsized employee share rewards, said it had adopted new guidelines that would limit its stock compensation plan and improve transparency. The company said its new guidelines would extend the number of years award shares will last, formalize its practice of share repurchases to minimize dilution and renew commitments to open dialogue with shareholders on compensation matters. About 83.16 percent of shareholders voted for the company’s 2014 equity plan when it came up for renewal in April, according to a Coca-Cola filing following the company’s annual meeting. However, the approval figure included a significant number of shareholders who had abstained from the vote, according to Reuters calculations. Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc holds 9.1 percent of Coca-Cola and is the company’s biggest shareholder, was among those who abstained. The billionaire said in an interview with Bloomberg that while he considered the plan to be “excessive” he did not vote against it out of loyalty to the company.  But it has been Wintergreen Advisers, which owns less than 1 percent of Coca-Cola on behalf of clients, which has been the most vocal critic of the company’s equity plan, saying it greatly diluted the holdings of current shareholders. “Coca-Cola has finally conceded that the equity compensation plan it put to a vote of shareholders in April was outrageously excessive and inconsistent with past plans,” Wintergreen Chief Executive David Winters said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. “No amount of backtracking by the Coca-Cola board of directors can hide the fact that we believe it tried to sneak one by shareholders in Coca-Cola’s proxy materials and statements at the April shareholder meeting,” he added. Wintergreen said in September that proxy filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that funds managed by State Street, Fidelity and Capital Group voted against the plan. “It looks to be a very unique approach to tell shareholders how the shares under this equity plan will be used with a great deal of responsibility, while addressing the criticisms about the plan from Berkshire as well as the other shareholders,” Frank Glassner, chief executive of Veritas Executive Compensation Consultants, told Reuters. Under the new guidelines, Coke’s compensation committee will limit the grants under the equity plan to an annual “burn rate” of no more than 0.8 percent in 2015. The burn rate refers to the number of shares granted as a percentage of outstanding shares. The guidelines will also facilitate a shift toward performance shares and be less heavily weighted toward stock options. “We consider the shift positive in that it means lower “automatic” payout of equity,” Stifel analysts wrote in a note. Coca-Cola said it expected shares authorized under the equity plan to last the full term of 10 years.

The company said its new guidelines would facilitate a shift towards performance shares and cash awards and be less heavily weighted toward stock options. Coke said it decided to amend its plan based on shareholder input and the move would minimize dilution to shareholders. Coca-Cola shares were up 13 cents to $42.79 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. “We heard positive feedback, not so positive feedback, and everything in between,” said Maria Elena Lagomasino, chair of Coke’s compensation committee, in a letter to shareholders posted on the company’s blog. “We know that not all of our shareowners agree on every issue, especially on a topic like equity compensation where views can vary greatly.” About 83.16 percent of shareholders voted for the company’s 2014 equity plan when it came up for renewal in April, according to a Coca-Cola filing following the company’s annual meeting.

It says the plan greatly diluted the holdings of current shareholders. “We think this is a major capitulation by the Coca-Cola Co.,” said Wintergreen Chief Executive David Winters in an interview Wednesday. He said, of the new guidelines, “we think the announcement is vague, and that we have a lot of questions which hopefully, they’re going to answer.” Winters said that until he saw more details of the plan, he couldn’t agree that it was less dilutive to shareholders. “Furthermore, it appears they want to pay out a lot more cash, and cash comes out of shareholders’ profits,” he said. Wintergreen said in September that proxy filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that funds managed by State Street, Fidelity and Capital Group voted against the plan. But another shareholder applauded the move by Coke. “Clearly communicating to the market how the company plans to use its equity is always a positive move as CalSTRS sees things,” said Ricardo Duran, spokesman for the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, the second largest U.S. pension fund.

Referring to Maria Elena Lagomasino, chair of Coca-Cola’s compensation committee, Buffett said, “I tip my hat to her.” Buffett said he felt as good as ever about his investment in Coca-Cola. He told CNBC earlier this year he had abstained from a shareholder vote on its controversial equity compensation plan when it came up for renewal in April, even though he considered it excessive. Buffett also said Burger King Worldwide Inc’s BKW.N $11.5 billion purchase of Tim Hortons Inc THI.TOTHI.N was not a tax-motivated deal. “Overwhelmingly, most inversion deals have had a huge tax motivation in doing them, I can tell you this one didn’t,” he said.  Berkshire committed $3 billion in preferred equity for 3G Capital, which controls Burger King, to buy Tim Hortons. Investors and tax experts have said the main reason for Burger King to move its domicile to Canada was to avoid double taxation on profits earned abroad.  Buffett said Berkshire’s investment in Tesco Plc (TSCO.L), Britain’s biggest retailer, was a “huge mistake.” Berkshire had a roughly 3.96 percent stake in Tesco’s shares, according to an early May regulatory filing. Tesco shares have fallen about 46 percent this year. Buffett also said his company’s purchase of auto dealership group Van Tuyl Group, announced Thursday, was an all-cash deal. He said Berkshire would likely buy “a lot more” dealerships over time. Buffett said if he was invested in asset manager Pimco, he would not have changed his investment after the departure of Bill Gross, the co-founder and chief investment officer. “I would assume that Pimco has got all kinds of professionals there managing money,” Buffett said. “I would not change, myself, just because Bill Gross left, I mean if I was happy with the personnel at Pimco.” Gross, one of the bond market’s most closely followed investors, quit Pimco, or the Pacific Investment Management Co, for distant rival Janus Capital Group Inc JNS.N last Friday.

555,KO,US STOCKS-Coca-Cola stays bubbly amid market rout,"NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were mostly lower on Friday, but consumer staples rose amid the market uncertainty, with beverage giant Coca-Cola Co again lifting the sector. Coke was up 1.6 percent to $44.55 and on track for a record close. Earlier this week, the Dow component hit a new all-time high, taking out a level that had persisted since 1998. Over the past 20 sessions, it has only dropped five times. “Investors are seeking to get more defensive, and that means buying high-quality names like Coca-Cola,” said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. The stock has some attributes that could lead to investor caution. More than half of its revenue comes from abroad, according to Thomson Reuters data, which could leave it vulnerable to both global weakness and a stronger U.S. dollar. Earlier this week, PepsiCo Inc warned of “continued macro and political volatility” overseas. Despite that, Pepsi also posted a strong profit in its most recent quarter and raised its full-year earnings outlook. “It is true that [large cap multinationals] have more exposure to the dollar, which could be a headwind for some, but if you look at the performance of stocks since the dollar bottomed, there’s been no correlation between international exposure and performance,” said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Chicago-based Northern Trust Asset Management. “So far, it hasn’t had a headwind.” Coke will report its quarterly results on Oct. 21.

Just ball on the fairway, ball on the green and made a few putts.”  Simpson endured a wretched Ryder Cup, playing only two matches (for a halve and a loss) after being one of captain Tom Watson’s three wild-card picks.

558,KO,Coca-Cola announces growth plan as profit falls 14 percent,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) on Tuesday announced new cost-cutting measures and a timeline for selling its bottling operations after its quarterly profit slumped 14 percent and the world’s largest beverage maker struggles to find growth amid a soft market for soda. The Atlanta-based company said it would hand back, or refranchise, about two-thirds of its North American bottling territories by the end of 2017, and a substantial portion of the remaining territories no later than 2020.  It is the clearest timeline that Coke has given to date as it seeks to sell the bottling operations to franchisees in a bid to shift away from the capital intensive and low-margin business of distribution. Coke also said that it was targeting $3 billion in cost savings by 2019, up from its announcement in February of $1 billion.  But the moves failed to impress investors. Coke shares were down 6 percent to $40.54 on Tuesday morning and down 1.8 percent this year while the S&P; 500 was up 4.3 percent. Coke is grappling with deteriorating economic conditions in major emerging markets as well as softness in consumer spending in the United States and Europe.  “This is placing strong pressure on the short-term performance of our business,” said Chief Executive Muhtar Kent on the company’s earnings conference call.   U.S. sales of carbonated soft drinks have been declining for nearly a decade, and more recently, consumers have shifted away from diet soda because of health concerns over artificial sweeteners.  Coke has tried to diversify its business by taking a smaller stake in companies in faster-growing markets and in some cases, eventually acquiring them. In August, Coca-Cola said it was buying a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O). Earlier this year, it bought a 10 percent stake in Keurig Green Mountain Inc GMCR.O which it raised to 16 percent in May to become Keurig’s largest shareholder.  Still, analysts said investors have been agitating for further cost-cutting. On the earnings conference call, Kent declined to give specifics on how much of the $3 billion would be reinvested in operations as opposed to flowing through to the bottom line but said the company would achieve a balance.  Industry watchers also have been waiting for more specifics on Coke’s North American bottling operations. Following a similar move by rival PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, Coke bought back its top bottler in the region in 2010 to streamline decision-making and cut costs.  The company also said it expected to miss its long-term earnings growth target in 2014, due in part to currency fluctuations.  Net income for the third quarter declined to $2.1 billion, or 48 cents a share, from $2.4 billion, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier.  Excluding charges for refranchising some North American bottling operations and other special items, earnings per share were 53 cents, in line with analysts’ expectations.

Apple Inc rose 2.4 percent to $102.18 a day after revenue topped expectations, helped by strong iPhone sales. It also gave a strong outlook for the holiday quarter. The largest percentage gainer and decliner on the S&P; 500 were both related to earnings. Waters Corp rose 9.3 percent after reporting early Tuesday, while Coca-Cola  fell 6.2 percent in its biggest one-day decline since October 2008. The largest percentage gainer on the Nasdaq 100 was Illumina Inc, which rose 8.6 percent a day after it said it expects full year adjusted net profit to be well above Wall Street’s expectations, while the largest decliner was Mattel , down just 0.2 percent. While earnings have largely come in strong so far this quarter, concerns continue to swirl over the pace of global economic growth. China’s gross domestic product grew 7.3 percent in the third quarter, the slowest pace since the first quarter of 2009.

The company also said it expected to miss its long-term earnings growth target in 2014, due in part to currency fluctuations. Net income for the third quarter declined to $2.1 billion, or 48 cents a share, from $2.4 billion, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges for refranchising some North American bottling operations and other special items, earnings per share were 53 cents, in line with analysts’ expectations. Overall revenue was flat at $11.97 billion versus expectations of $12.12 billion.

568,KO,Kirk aims to make major splash on 2014-15 PGA Tour,"(Reuters) - Eleven months ago, Chris Kirk clinched The McGladrey Classic by one shot, setting the tone for a landmark PGA Tour campaign highlighted by two tournament wins and a lofty second place in the final FedExCup standings. That career-best season is now behind him and the American is back in Georgia this week to defend his McGladrey Classic title at Sea Island with his sights set on at least maintaining the high level of play he produced on the 2013-14 PGA Tour. “Winning (The McGladrey Classic) last year was a huge boost for me,” former Sea Island resident Kirk told reporters on Wednesday while preparing for Thursday’s opening round in the tournament hosted by Davis Love III on the Seaside Course. “I was coming off a pretty solid season the year before that but just didn’t quite give myself any legitimate chances to win a tournament. “So to put myself in that position, especially here at Sea Island, a place that is so important to me ... was pretty amazing and then I was able to keep the momentum for most of the season after that.” Kirk, who won his maiden PGA Tour title at the 2011 Viking Classic, produced stellar form during the 2013-14 season, recording five top-10s in 28 starts, including victories at the McGladrey and Deutsche Bank Championship. He finished second in the season-long FedExCup standings and narrowly missed out on securing his place as a rookie on the 2014 U.S. Ryder Cup team. As he approaches his first tournament on the 2014-15 PGA Tour, Kirk has a clear idea of how he wants his golfing progress to continue. “Contending and possibly wining majors is where I’d like to go,” said the 29-year-old from Knoxville, Tennessee. “Just to maintain the level of play I have had over the last year would be a pretty good accomplishment in itself too. “I really had a great year last year and it takes a lot of hard work and a lot of good breaks to do that. “So I’m hoping to just play as much good golf as I can and if I can just improve a little bit here and there, my game will translate well and my comfort level in majors will increase.” Kirk, who clinched the third PGA Tour victory of his career by two shots at the Deutsche Bank Championship in Massachusetts early last month, will play the first two rounds at Sea Island in high-profile company. He has been grouped with compatriots Ben Martin, who won his maiden PGA Tour title at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open on Sunday, and tournament host Love, Kirk’s long-time golfing idol. Also competing this week are 11-time PGA Tour winner and Sea Island resident Zach Johnson, fellow American and world number nine Matt Kuchar and Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama, who has launched the new season with consecutive top-10 finishes.

580,KO,"Berkshire invests in Express Scripts, makes confidential disclosure","Nov 14 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  disclosed a new stake in healthcare management company Express Scripts Holding Co and shed its stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co, among several changes in its stock investments during the third quarter. In a regulatory filing, Berkshire also revealed it has disclosed confidential information about its investments to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC often allows Buffett to do this to let him amass a large investment without worrying about copycat investors.  Berkshire disclosed last week that it had bought more than $2.3 billion of equity securities in the third quarter. Berkshire bought 449,489 shares of Express Scripts in the quarter, making it among the smallest holdings in its portfolio. Shares of Express Scripts rose 0.4 percent in after-hours trading to $78.20. Companies’ shares often rise when Berkshire reveals new investments because some investors consider it a vote of confidence by Buffett. In contrast, Berkshire eliminated its stake in Deere, which it had originally bought two years ago. Berkshire did not disclose what investments were made by Buffett’s portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. Buffett has said he generally makes Berkshire’s larger investments such as Wells Fargo & Co and Coca-Cola Co , while Combs or Weschler, who have smaller sums to invest, make other investments, especially in sectors he is less familiar with. Other changes to Berkshire’s stock portfolio simply adjusted already-existing positions. Berkshire raised its share stakes in several companies including DirecTV, General Motors, MasterCard and Suncor Energy. It also cut its share stakes in Bank of New York Mellon, ConocoPhillips, National Oilwell Varco and Phillips 66. U.S. regulators require large investors each quarter to disclose their stock holdings, offering a window to their investment strategies. The view is limited because investors are not required to list short positions, foreign holdings and bonds, and because it reflects the just-completed quarter. Berkshire ended September with about $118.9 billion of equities, the vast majority of which are on U.S. exchanges. It also owns more than 80 businesses ranging from ice cream to insurance to railroads.

582,KO,"UPDATE 2-SABMiller, Coke team up to bottle Africa's fizzy drinks","* Non-cash deal to help speed up African expansion * Coke to buy SABMiller some non-alcoholic brands * SABMiller says merger to save soft drink expansion spending   (Adds details, SABMiller Africa comment ) By Tiisetso Motsoeneng and Helen Nyambura-Mwaura JOHANNESBURG, Nov 27 (Reuters) - SABMiller   and Coca-Cola will combine the operations which mix, bottle and distribute their soft drinks in Africa, creating a group with sales of $2.9 billion and ambitions to corner a fast-growing market. Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will be the continent’s largest soft drinks bottler, accounting for 40 percent of all Coke volumes sold in Africa. It will serve 12 southern and eastern African countries, including South Africa. The broader deal — which will also hand Coca-Cola an extra 20 brands, including Appletiser — will extend both firms’ distribution networks and presence. It comes as brewers like SABMiller bulk up on low-margin fizzy drinks in emerging markets, where soft drinks are outpacing more lucrative sales of beer. For SABMiller, bottling soft drinks may be less profitable than packaging beer, but it is also a cheaper way to grow. “The idea behind the merger is to expand quicker, and over time we will look for more bottlers to acquire to grow the business further,” Mark Bowman, Africa head of SABMiller. “The capital we would have spent today to expand our soft drinks business in Africa is probably half what we expect to spend in the future.” Coke and SABMiller did not say how much they expected to save with the deal. Households in Africa’s growing economies are finding themselves with more disposable income, which they are spending on what previously would have been considered luxuries. Africa’s consumer spending on shopping, banking, telecoms and tourism could grow to $978 billion by 2020, from $570 billion in 2010, according to McKinsey. While many U.S. and European companies are taking a serious look at Africa, both Coke and SABMiller are veterans. SABMiller was founded as South African Breweries, while Coke has built a distribution network that allows its drinks to reach tiny tuckshops in far-flung townships. The all-equity deal pulls together SABMiller, Coke and Coke’s South African bottling partner, the Gutsche family. SABMiller will own 57 percent of the group, Coke will hold 11.3 percent and the rest will be in the hands of the Gutsches. As part of the deal, Coke will acquire SABMiller’s sparkling soft drink Appletiser brands globally, and buy or be licensed for a further 19 non-alcoholic names in Africa and Latin America for about $260 million. SABMiller will retain its non-alcoholic malt beverages in Africa and Latin America and also keep Coke’s franchises in El Salvador and Honduras. Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will have more than 30 bottling plants when the deal is completed. Nomura and NLA advised Coca-Cola Sabco and Rothschild advised SAB Miller on the deal.

585,KO,"A selfie on your shoes? Personalised gifts for ""Millennials""","* “Millennial” generation keen on self-expression * Mars, Coca-Cola, Nike, Adidas offer personalised products * Co-creation trend spreads as technology advances * Personalisation helps retailers draw shoppers to stores By Emma Thomasson BERLIN, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Looking for a unique Christmas gift to wow friends or family? Try some specially tailored perfume, chocolates stamped with a personal message or sneakers embossed with a selfie. Products with that individual twist are not really new. It has long been possible to get a basic T-shirt, baseball cap or umbrella printed with a name or photo. But big consumer brands, including major names like Coca-Cola, and Nike have latched on to personalised products because they seem to have a particular appeal to consumers known as “Millennials” in marketing speak. Used to posting selfie mobile phone shots on social media, this generation, who came of age from around 2000, wants something more than just the latest hot brand name. Millennials still like brands but expect them to listen and react to their ideas and criticism in real time and allow them a role in shaping future products. They have become a big focus of marketing experts as their spending power grows. “They’re drawn to brands who are rethinking the way things are done. They want to be heard,” Maryleigh Bliss, trends editor at youth marketing firm Ypulse, told the World Retail Congress earlier this year. Early to respond was Mars Inc, which prints tiny personal messages and photos on M&Ms; chocolates, and Coca-Cola which scored a hit by putting people’s names on its bottles, selling more than 150 million. “It was a crazy idea but ... it really connected because it has all the characteristics that appeal to Millennials,” Coca-Cola chief marketing officer Joe Tripodi said. “It was customisable, it was social.” Coca-Cola has gone a step further to produce its first fully user-generated commercial, including shaky videos showing its fans enjoying a Coke. It has also come up with the Freestyle machine which allows people to mix their own soft drink. The “co-creation” fad is spreading to more complex products and processes as technology brings down costs. U.S. sportswear firm Nike allows people to customise colours of shoes and accessories. German rival Adidas has tapped into the selfie obsession by offering shoppers the option to put personal images on the uppers of ZX Flux sneakers. While Adidas customers currently have to wait three to four weeks for the delivery of “selfie shoes,” the proliferation of technology like 3-D printing means it might not be long before personalised products can be made on the spot in a store. Ben Perkins, a consumer expert at consultants Deloitte, said brands and retailers have to act fast to keep up with rising expectations for more personalisation. “As speeds improve, this kind of real-time product design, development and manufacture is going to be increasingly scaled,” he said. “Don’t look at your customer base today but look at them tomorrow and think about how you need to embed these approaches and technologies ... in your organisation now.” Retailers trying to cope with the growth of online shopping are also looking at co-creation as a way to attract consumers back into their stores. British department store Selfridges and Swiss fragrance maker Givaudan created a “lab” installation where shoppers can develop a perfume, bottle shape and label tailored to their personality. Australian online start-up Shoes of Prey allows customers to choose from 170 different fabrics to design their own shoes. It launched studios in six branches of upscale U.S. department store chain Nordstrom last month. Shoes of Prey delivers within four weeks but is working towards a two-week turnaround. Chief Executive Michael Fox said that the business model was more profitable and involved less waste as there was no need to discount excess stock. “Customers are looking to participate in the design process to get exactly what they want. Together we see customisation and manufacturing on demand as the future of retail,” Fox said.       (Reporting by Emma Thomasson.

(bit.ly/1zgoDKY)  “The strategic investments made by CEO Muhtar Kent have destroyed shareholder value. His blunders on failed acquisitions alone have cost shareholders $16.3 billion,” Wintergreen said in a statement accompanying an analysis of Coca-Cola’s performance. The investment firm also said Coca-Cola’s new equity compensation guidelines could continue to reward its top managers unjustly, and an emphasis on cash bonuses could cost shareholders as much as $10.20 per share. “We utterly reject David Winters’ (Wintergreens CEO) claims,” Coca-Cola said in an email.  “Muhtar Kent and the company’s leadership team have outlined meaningful strategic plans to accelerate sustainable and profitable growth and deliver long-term value to our shareowners.” Coca-Cola bought Glaceau, the maker of Vitaminwater, for $4.1 billion in 2007 and Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc’s CCE.N North American business for $12.2 billion in 2010. Wintergreen said the two acquisitions have destroyed shareholder value. This year alone, Coca-Cola spent $3.5 billion in buying minority stakes in beverage companies Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O) and Keurig Green Mountain Inc GMCR.O. Following criticism from Warren Buffett and other investors for its outsized employee share rewards, Coca-Cola said in October it had adopted new guidelines that would limit its executive compensation plan starting next year.  The company had said the guidelines would facilitate a shift toward performance shares and cash awards and be less weighted toward stock options. Wintergreen said on Monday Coke’s problems could be resolved by fixing its compensation plan, cutting expenses and replacing the board and management. Kent has served as Coke’s CEO and chairman since April 2009. Up to Friday's close, Coke's shares had fallen about 1 percent this year, compared with an 8 percent rise in the S&P; 500 index .SPX.

Emad al-Hindi, director-general of the Palestinian National Beverage Company which produces the soft drink in the occupied West Bank, said 10 truckloads of machinery had arrived in Gaza via a crossing with Israel.  Israel confirmed it had allowed nine truckloads from Jordan to reach Gaza for an enterprise it hoped would provide jobs for hundreds of people in the coastal territory. Hindi said he expected more equipment to be shipped from Germany and Turkey and hoped the machines would be installed at a location in central Gaza by March “so that we can launch operations before the end of 2015.”  “The factory building is ready, lines of produce are ready,” Hindi said, adding “we hope to be able to conclude all the stages without any obstacles.” Hindi estimated total investment would come to $20 million and hoped the factory would employ 360 Palestinians by 2016 and more at a later stage, a small but critical economic opportunity in a territory plagued by poverty and where war has destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of buildings. The plant would be the first to produce Coca Cola in Gaza, which already has a Pepsi plant PEP.N. Israel’s approval of the plant, a plan for which was developed over the past two years, preceded a July-August war involving Israel and Hamas Islamists who dominate in Gaza, in which more than 2,100 Palestinians and 70 Israelis were killed. Post-war reconstruction in Gaza has been slow, with donations from abroad trickling in slowly and Israel tightly monitoring Gaza’s imports of construction equipment to prevent Hamas militants from rebuilding tunnels to launch attacks. In a related development, President Mahmoud Abbas’s Palestinian Authority took a step towards implementing a key truce term that ended the Gaza war by naming a panel on Monday to take control of Gaza’s crossings with Israel from Hamas. A statement by Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Al-Hamdallah said the committee would meet with Gaza officials to “enhance the work of the crossings and speed up reconstruction.” Their mission would also involve talks with Hamas officials to agree to a handover of the Islamists’ role at the crossings.

595,KO,U.S. Postal Service eyes e-commerce to offset declining mail,"CHICAGO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Facing a slump in the mail it had been delivering since the days of America’s Revolutionary War, in 2012 the U.S. Postal Service began aggressively targeting e-commerce and lapsed customers as the way to salvage its declining business. “Really it started almost at the level of cold-calling, talking to people who really hadn’t spoken to us in a long time,” said Nagisa Manabe, who joined the USPS in May 2012 as chief marketing and sales officer from Coca-Cola Co after a career in the private sector. “And really trying to persuade them to consider us as a very viable alternative in the shipping market.” With further drops in its traditional bread-and-butter products ahead, the USPS wants to capitalize on e-commerce, which consulting firm Detroit LLP has predicted should grow 14 percent this holiday season alone. But industry experts question whether the USPS has enough space in its delivery vans and whether its unionized work force can handle a greater proportion of the e-commerce market. Over the past two years the USPS has rolled out real-time scanning for packages, a vital tool for online retailers and consumers alike to track their packages. It is also upgrading all of its delivery workers’ handheld scanners. The rise of the Internet has taken a heavy toll on first-class mail, the USPS’s most profitable product. That falling business played a significant role in the USPS’s fiscal 2014 loss of $5.5 billion, its eighth consecutive year in the red. From 2009 to 2013, the volume of first-class mail deliveries dropped more than 20 percent. In the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, USPS deliveries declined to 155.4 billion pieces from 158.2 billion. First-class deliveries accounted for 2.2 billion pieces of that decline. But package deliveries rose to more than 4 billion pieces from 3.7 billion, accounting for $1.1 billion of the USPS’s revenue growth of $1.9 billion. In the run-up to Christmas, the USPS has been doing Sunday deliveries for Amazon.com Inc  in a number of cities. Manabe adds that the agency will handle the online retailer’s push into same-day and next-day deliveries “in many markets.” EBay Inc is another major customer and Manabe says “pretty much anyone who’s in the e-commerce space at least does some volume with us.” Many in the delivery industry are waiting to see how the USPS has handled surging e-commerce volumes in the days before Christmas. The USPS’s competitive advantage lies in the fact that it already delivers to every house in America and analysts estimate it can do so for around a quarter of the cost charged by United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp, which are both competitors and customers of the USPS. “The U.S. Postal Service has the ultimate last-mile delivery network, so it has a real opportunity here,” said Vinnie DeAngelis, vice president of postal relations at Neopost USA, which provides tracking and other software for e-commerce retailers and delivery companies. According to shipment-tracking software developer ShipMatrix Inc, in 2013 the USPS accounted for 59.2 percent of e-commerce deliveries, while UPS accounted for 31.9 percent and FedEx 8.9 percent. The USPS has predicted holiday package volume growth of around 12 percent this year from Nov. 17 to Christmas. In the years ahead, the USPS expects 80 percent of U.S. ZIP codes will see “significantly more business,” Manabe said. But many of the USPS’s current delivery vehicles are more than 25 years old and built for mail instead of larger packages. “They (the USPS) tend to operate smaller vehicles that really cube out (fill up) pretty quickly as opposed to the network we have in place,” FedEx Executive Vice President Michael Glenn said during a Dec. 17 earnings conference call with analysts. Delivery companies measure their vehicles’ three-dimensional space in cubes. The USPS plans to spend more than $10 billion over the next four years on a new fleet of vehicles. Manabe said that could mean three or four different sizes of vehicles to handle different package volumes in urban and rural areas. Some industry experts are concerned that the USPS, whose operations are dictated by Congress, may have trouble handling e-commerce growth due to its quasi-government unionized workers. “When I think about the USPS business model, I don’t believe they are ever going to get the productivity of FedEx or UPS,” said Brian Hancock, a board member of the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals. But Manabe insists the unionized work force is on board and recognizes the importance of e-commerce. The last few delivery days before Christmas have been a test for the USPS. After struggling with a late surge in online orders last year that left an estimated 2 million packages stranded on Christmas Eve, UPS and FedEx both made it clear this year that they would reject a last-minute flood of packages if it threatened their systems. Rick Jones, a former UPS executive and now CEO of regional delivery company Lone Star Overnight, says that for many retailers this holiday season, the USPS may have become the carrier of last resort. “The question is whether their smaller vehicles, which are designed for mail rather than packages, could handle the extra volume,” he said.

596,KO,New putting grip helps Kirk sign off with a 62,"KAPALUA, Hawaii (Reuters) - Chris Kirk ended a roller-coaster week at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions in record-equalling style, profiting from a new putting grip as he fired a sizzling 11-under-par 62 in Monday’s final round. Dead-last overnight in the elite winners-only field of 33, Kirk rocketed up the leaderboard with a barrage of birdies on the hilly Plantation Course at the Kapalua Resort to post a 13-under total of 279. The 29-year-old, a three-times winner on the PGA Tour, employed a ‘claw’ grip on his putter as he picked up four shots before the turn, then covered the back nine in a scintillating seven-under 30 to match the tournament course record. “I haven’t got to practise a whole lot but something kind of clicked for me on the back nine,” Kirk, who booked his place in the elite field by winning the Deutsche Bank Championship in September, told reporters. “I hit a lot of wedges close, and I drove it way better today. I drove it right where I was looking all day, which was nice.” South Korean K.J. Choi was the first player to shoot a 62 at the Kapalua event, doing so in the third round in 2003. Northern Ireland’s Graeme McDowell then followed suit in the final round in 2011. Kirk, who opened with a 68 at Kapalua before plummeting down the leaderboard with a 76 and 73, introduced the claw putting grip for the first time during Sunday’s third round. With a claw grip, the bottom hand comes off the putter grip and rests gently against the shaft. “It’s something that I’ve been practicing with for probably six months, and I hadn’t put it in play yet until yesterday,” said the American, who raced around the Plantation Course in under three hours as he did not have a playing partner. “I putted really well last year ... but there were some times I didn’t feel like I was getting the ball started on line as well as I could. I generally am a very good putter out here because I have good speed and I read the greens really well. “So if I can find a way to consistently start the ball on line a little bit better, I should be able to have more days like today.” ",1132015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-golf-pga-kirk/new-putting-grip-helps-kirk-sign-off-with-a-62-idUSKBN0KM01K20150113

599,KO,Coke's Fuze and Gold Peak brands top $1 billion in sales,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three years ago, Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) ended a joint venture with Nestle SA NESN.VX to sell iced tea in the United States and focused on the ready-to-drink teas it was developing in-house. The decision is paying off when it comes to sales of two of the soda giant’s tea brands, Fuze and Gold Peak. The company says they both now produce annual revenues of at least $1 billion.  “Increasingly, we’ve seen this category being very fertile and growing in quite a few regions across the world,” said Samir Bhutada, the company’s global director of tea and ready-to-drink coffee, in an interview. The company launched Gold Peak in 2006 and Fuze in 2012.  Global sales in the ready-to-drink tea category have more than doubled in the last decade, and sales are expected to reach $53.9 billion this year, according to Euromonitor International. For companies that sell soft drinks like Coke and PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, the category represents an opportunity to diversify the portfolio as both have faced pressure from investors amid a decade long decline in U.S. soft drink sales.  Pepsi’s chief executive Indra Nooyi last year said the company’s Lipton Pure Leaf tea, which it markets through a joint venture with Unilever PLC	(ULVR.L), was among its products that achieved more than $100 million in retail sales in its launch year and generated double digit retail sales growth in the second year.  Coke had roughly 9 percent of global market share for tea last year, according to Euromonitor. Gold Peak is positioned as a homebrewed tea for U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, Fuze, which combines tea and fruit juice, has performed well in overseas markets like Turkey and Mexico. “The concept is to sort of take this as an alternative to sodas, especially as we’re seeing more and more consumer backlash to carbonated soft drinks in Latin America as well as Europe,” said Jonas Feliciano, senior beverages analyst at Euromonitor.

Rexam said it had received a proposal from Broomfield, Colorado-based Ball valuing it at 610 pence per share. Rexam’s London-traded shares closed significantly lower, at 541.5 pence. Under UK takeover rules, Ball has until March 5 to say whether it will make a formal offer or walk away. Ball executives declined to take questions about the proposal during a post-earnings conference call on Thursday. Packaging deals are heating up as low interest rates and robust cash flows coincide with growing demand. Last week, corrugated box makers MeadWestvaco Corp and Rock-Tenn Co  agreed to form a $16 billion company. Rexam and Ball, suppliers to Coca-Cola Co and Anheuser-Busch InBev, are two of the three big players in the global beverage can market. Each controls slightly more than a fifth of the market. Their nearest competitor, Crown Holdings Inc, has a 19 percent share, according to Vertical Research Partners. “The combination, strategically, just makes a ton of sense,” said Macquarie Research analyst Albert Kabili. It might also, however, spark antitrust concerns. Kabili said both companies would probably have to divest some assets given the potential size of their combined market share in the United States, Brazil and Europe. Jonathan Klarfeld, partner at law firm Ropes & Gray LLP, said consolidation in the U.S. packaging industry was “one of the ways to bring additional value” out of a sector with modest growth prospects. Can makers are also contending with record-high aluminium premiums. The cost of getting the metal out of storage is expected to peak again by mid-2015 due to a supply deficit in the United States and Europe.

Jefferies & Co analyst Philip Ng said the proposal, at a premium of 36 percent to Rexam’s Wednesday close, was more expensive than other deals in the metal packaging sector.

603,KO,REFILE-US STOCKS-Wall St rises on Greek deal hopes even as energy drops,"(Changes “Sahran” to “Sarhan” in paragraph 4) * Coca-Cola up after earnings, Apple up after bond pricing * Pfizer rises after share buyback news * Indexes up: Dow 0.78 pct, S&P; 1.04 pct, Nasdaq 1.26 pct By Sinead Carew NEW YORK, Feb 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday on hopes that Greek debt negotiations could result in a deal that stabilizes Europe although a drop in oil prices limited the advance. S&P; 500 utilities and healthcare stocks led the market increase as those sectors bounced back after they declined the day before, while the energy sector was hurt the fall in oil prices. Investors are sticking to trading within a narrow range as they wait for geopolitical news from Greece and Ukraine, said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital in New York. “Today you’re bouncing off a 50 day moving average, which is a pure technical play. The fundamentals are improving a little bit because the situation in Ukraine did not explode. That was a concern over the weekend. Also Greece hasn’t fallen off the radar,” Sarhan said. “Investors are looking at this as a cup that’s half full, not half empty.” The European Commission said there was no formal proposal for resolving Greece’s debt problems, although talks were intensive ahead of a series of meetings of euro zone finance ministers and EU leaders in Brussels. But the Commission is expected to introduce a compromise proposal, according to a report by MNSI, citing unnamed sources. “Clearly the market thinks some resolution’s going to come out of this that’s going to make bondholders not suffer the consequences,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. The first drop in oil prices in four sessions pushed the energy index, down 0.5 percent, making it the only S&P; sector in the red. U.S. crude prices fell 5 percent after the International Energy Agency warned of more selloffs in the near term as stockpiles continue to rise. At 3:07 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average rose 139.02 points, or 0.78 percent, to 17,868.23, the S&P; 500  gained 21.25 points, or 1.04 percent, to 2,067.99 and the Nasdaq Composite added 59.42 points, or 1.26 percent, to 4,785.43. Coca-Cola Co shares climbed 3 percent boosting both the Dow and S&P; 500 after it reported a better-than-expected profit. Apple Inc shares rose 1.9 percent and helped boost the Nasdaq and the S&P; 500 after it priced Swiss franc bonds. Pfizer Inc rose 3 percent, lifting the S&P; healthcare sector after saying it would buy back $5 billion of its stock. Even with high-profile earnings misses from multinationals, largely as a result of dollar strength, Thomson Reuters data through Tuesday morning showed that 72.7 percent of S&P; 500 companies beat earnings estimates, above the 69 percent beat rate in the past four quarters. NYSE advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 1,698 to 1,355, for a 1.25-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,649 issues rose and 1,082 fell for a 1.52-to-1 ratio favoring advancers. The benchmark S&P; 500 index was posting 28 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 51 new highs and 34 new lows.

604,KO,Coke's price increase encourages beverage company shareholders,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) raised the overall prices it charges its retail customers in North America 4 percent in the latest quarter, the company said on Tuesday, a signal to industry watchers that soft-drink rival PepsiCo PEP.N probably raised prices too. Analysts said the increase PepsiCo would likely report on Wednesday would probably not be as steep, since Coke had several promotions in the year-earlier period.  If other beverage companies like Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc DPS.N and Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O) also report increases, soda company investors will view it as a good start to the year. “The more reinforcement that you get of a constructive pricing environment, the better it is for its prospects for 2015,” said UBS analyst Stephen Powers. He added that the 4 percent increase “certainly exceeded our expectations...I would be very impressed if they could sustain that run rate.” Analysts said they do not expect Coke to be as aggressive with prices in North America in 2015 as commodity costs come down.  “Competitors could take advantage of those and play the price game and hence, gain market share,” said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones, in an email. The increase does not mean Coke hiked the prices on all the products it sells. Beverage companies can raise prices through the mix of products and packaging they offer. Coke and PepsiCo have said that smaller portion sizes, which enable them to charge higher prices per fluid ounce, have been popular with U.S. consumers. The company said on its earnings conference call that mini-can sales rose 15 percent in the quarter. Investors care about Coke’s prices because sales volumes have been sluggish. Raising prices is one way a company can try to boost profitability and offset currency impacts in overseas markets. For Coke, North American profitability is important to watch since the company is in the process of selling off its bottling operations in the region, and boosting profit margins would help tempt would-be franchisees.  Coke said commodities were unlikely to have much of an effect on pricing. On the company’s earnings conference call, Irial Finan, president of bottling investments, said Coke had found a balance between prices and volume growth in North America.  “Our plan is to deliver again next year in the same way,” he said.

On the company’s earnings conference call, Irial Finan, president of bottling investments, said Coke had found a balance between prices and volume growth in North America. “Our plan is to deliver again next year in the same way,” he said.

The European Commission will introduce a compromise proposal in which Greece should ask for a six-month period to discuss with lenders any pending issues and post-bailout plan, according to a report by MNSI, citing unnamed sources. The Commission said there was no formal proposal for resolving Greece’s debt problems, although talks were intensive ahead of a series of meetings of euro zone finance ministers and EU leaders in Brussels. “Clearly the market thinks some resolution’s going to come out of this that’s going to make bondholders not suffer the consequences, and that’s why the market is up,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. The first drop in oil prices in four sessions weighed on the S&P; energy index, sending it down 1.1 percent, the only  one of 10 S&P; sectors to decline. U.S. crude was off 5 percent at $50.22 per barrel after the International Energy Agency warned of more selloffs in the near term as stockpiles continue to rise. “We are going to bounce around here until there is some clarity and some stability in the price of oil and economically in the European Union,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. At 2:03 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average rose 75.78 points, or 0.43 percent, to 17,804.99, the S&P; 500  gained 12.96 points, or 0.63 percent, to 2,059.7 and the Nasdaq Composite added 43.98 points, or 0.93 percent, to 4,769.99. Coca-Cola Co shares climbed 2.6 percent to $42.21 to help lift both the Dow and S&P; 500. It reported a better-than-expected profit and sales in North America, its biggest market, rose for the first time in four quarters to offset the impact of a strong dollar on its overseas business. Apple Inc shares rose 1.6 percent and helped boost the Nasdaq and the S&P; 500 after it priced Swiss franc bonds. Pfizer Inc helped boost the S&P; healthcare sector after saying it would buy back $5 billion of its stock. Even with high-profile earnings misses from multinationals, largely as a result of dollar strength, Thomson Reuters data through Tuesday morning showed that 72.7 percent of S&P; 500 companies beat earnings estimates, above the 69 percent beat rate in the past four quarters.

Futures had surged to a session high after MNSI reported the EU Commission will propose a 6-month debt extension, citing sources. The European Commission said there was no formal proposal for resolving Greece’s debt problems, although talks were intensive ahead of a series of meetings of euro zone finance ministers and EU leaders in Brussels. “Markets have been driven by this Greek drama and, as it plays out in real time in front of us, anything that looks like we are getting closer in negotiations and resolution is certainly going to be positive here,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. “Anything that makes us believe we can avoid a sloppy Greek exit is going to be a positive for markets overall, and that is where we are at right now.” The Dow Jones industrial average rose 85.03 points, or 0.48 percent, to 17,814.24, the S&P; 500 gained 9.84 points, or 0.48 percent, to 2,056.58 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 25.29 points, or 0.54 percent, to 4,751.31. Coca-Cola Co shares climbed 3.7 percent to $42.75 as one of the biggest boosts to the Dow and S&P; 500. It reported a better-than-expected profit and sales in North America, its biggest market, rose for the first time in four quarters to offset the impact of a strong dollar on its overseas business. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc rose 6.3 percent to $75.74 after the company posted quarterly results and announced plans to spin off its vacation timeshare business. General Motors said Harry Wilson, a former member of the U.S. auto task force that helped restructure the company in 2009 during its bankruptcy, wants to join the board of directors and have the automaker commit to a $8 billion share buyback program.

612,KO,Coca-Cola profit beats estimates; North American soda sales up,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported a  slightly higher-than-expected profit on Tuesday as sales in North America, its biggest market, rose for the first time in four quarters, offsetting the impact of a stronger dollar on its overseas business. Shares of the world’s largest beverage maker rose 3.2 percent to $42.56 in premarket trading. Coke’s sales in North America have declined or remained flat for the last three quarters as U.S. consumers opt for healthier beverages and shift away from diet sodas due to concerns about artificial sweeteners. North American sales rose 2 percent to $5.37 billion in the fourth quarter, accounting for about half of total sales. Analysts say U.S. consumers are still drinking less soda but are paying more for it. Coke’s prices in North America rose 4 percent overall in the quarter.  Low gasoline prices and a brighter job market have encouraged many consumers to dig a little deeper into their pockets. U.S. consumer confidence is at its highest in more than seven years, according to a report released in January. In a research note, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg called the fourth quarter a “silver lining quarter,” saying efforts to improve growth should eventually bear fruit. Coke said in October that it was targeting $3 billion in cost savings by 2019. It also announced a timeline for selling its lower-margin bottling operations.  In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Kathy Waller said the cost-cutting plan, as well as the timeline for refranchising bottlers, was on track.  At the end of last year, the company said it would eliminate 1,600 to 1,800 positions. Those workers are being notified, Waller said.  Coke has said it would reinvest $1 billion of the cost savings into its brands. Waller said it would do the same with the remaining $2 billion, as well as invest in research and  development, “if we see a great opportunity.” The company said net income attributable to shareholders fell to $770 million, or 17 cents per share, in the quarter from $1.71 billion, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items such as the effects of cost-cutting measures and the refranchising of bottlers, the company earned 44 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 42 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net operating revenue fell 2 percent to $10.87 billion, exceeding analysts’ estimates of $10.76 billion.

The world’s second-largest bottler of Coca-Cola drinks, which counts Russia as its biggest market, surged 7 percent after Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko announced the ceasefire agreement following peace talks in Minsk with his Russian, French and German counterparts. “Traders were not holding out much hope for the talks in Minsk, but the market was pleasantly surprised by the announcement. At least one set of talks that are taking place in Europe has ended well, and dealers are still seeking an outcome for the Greek debt discussion,” IG market analyst David Madden said. “The markets are more concerned about Greece’s fate as the indebted nation is just over two weeks away from its bailout deadline, and no solution is in sight yet.” After seven hours of crisis talks in Brussels, Greece’s new leftist government and its international creditors failed to agree on a way forward on an unpopular bailout and will try again on Monday. The FTSE 100 index was up 0.2 percent at 6,830.13 points by 1524 GMT after falling in the previous four sessions. Basic resources stocks were in demand, with the UK mining index rising 2.1 percent, helped by a 2.6 percent rise in Rio Tinto after the global miner announced plans to return $2 billion to shareholders and offered a higher than expected dividend. “Rio numbers are well received as expectations of a buyback were fulfilled and a higher dividend will keep shareholders happy. With not much out there on the acquisition front, the best thing it could do was to reward its shareholders,” Securequity sales trader Jawaid Afsar said.

Strong British labour-market data also reinforced expectations of an interest-rate hike soon, pushing gilt yields up to their highest since the end of last year and further emphasising the contrast between the UK and the euro zone - where the European Central Bank has pledged to buy bonds to compress rates further. The FTSE 100 index rose to 6,921.32, its highest since January 2000 and only 0.4 percent off the record high of 6,950.60 set in December 1999, before easing back to a closing level of 6,898.08. “Markets reacted most to the idea that the inflation drop is temporary and that inflation will pick up sharply at the end of 2015 spurring a rate-hike sooner than (mid-2016),” said Jasper Lawler, analyst at CMC Markets. Technical analysts said that while the new peak could spur the market on towards a record high, a failure to close above 6,900 could see the market drop away again. “This could turn out to be a false breakout for, after all, it is not the first time the FTSE has peaked above 6,900 only to then stage a sell-off,” said Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Gain Capital. “A decisive close above 6,900 would be a particularly bullish outcome, while below this key level would be bearish.” By 1430 GMT it was down 18.11 points, or 0.3 percent at 6,880.02.

Coca-Cola Hellenic dropped 3.1 percent after the company reported a 11.4 percent drop in profits and on concern about developments in Ukraine.

The company reported profit of 1.583 billion pesos ($107 million), up from 1.284 billion pesos in the year earlier period. Revenue rose 6 percent to 16.2 billion pesos, and sales volumes were up 0.7 percent, marking the first quarter of volume growth in the year, the company reported. Mexico approved a tax of 1 peso per liter on sugary drinks and an 8 percent tax on fast food in 2013 as part of a wider tax overhaul that took effect at the start of 2014. Mexicans are the world’s biggest consumers of soda per person, drinking an average 707 8-ounce (0.24 liter) servings each year, according to U.S. newsletter Beverage Digest. Since the tax changes, sales of Coke products have fallen for Arca and its bigger rival, Coca-Cola Femsa. Both companies have been trying to offset that by offering more types of beverages, such as juices and teas, as well as water. Arca shares were up 2.43 percent at 94.85 pesos in morning trading.

CC HBC distributes Coke products in 27 countries in Europe and Nigeria. Sales volume in Greece, where CC HBC operates four plants, grew two percent last year for the first time since 2008 as the country emerged from a crippling six-year recession. Lois said that despite the improvement, trading conditions in the country remained tough as austerity was still hurting households’ disposable income. But the bottler was not holding back its Greek investments. “There is a 360 (degree) approach in our investment strategy in Greece and we are continuing with that. We are absolutely committed,” Lois said.

The company warned that conditions this year will remain challenging, lowering slightly its 2013-2015 target for free cash flow to between 1.1 and 1.2 billion euros from about 1.3 billion due to the adverse impact of currency depreciation. Net profit reached 30.4 million euros ($35 million) from 34.3 million in the same period last year. Russia is CCHBC’s biggest market and has been its main growth driver in recent years. But a stagnating economy due in part to Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis has squeezed consumer spending, hurting demand for Coke products. The acquisition of a new juice brand in Russia helped growth resume in the country, with sales volume rising by a mid-single digit percentage in the fourth quarter, it said. Total group sales volume rose 0.8 percent to 485.1 million unit cases, reversing from a 3.9 percent drop in the nine months to September. In Greece sales volume grew 2 percent last year, rising for the first time since 2008 as the economy stabilised, but the company said it remained cautious due to fragile economic conditions. CCHBC said it would continue increasing prices to mitigate the impact of currency weakness, while lower input costs due to the drop in oil prices are expected to help its bottom line. The bottler said it will pay a dividend of 0.36 euros per shares on 2014 results, versus 0.35 euros the year before.

625,KO,UPDATE 2-Mexico's Coke Femsa reports flat fourth-quarter profit,"(Adds details on currency losses, operating profit, context) MEXICO CITY, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Femsa, the biggest Coke bottler in Latin America, on Wednesday reported a 0.3 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings, hurt by muted sales and currency weakness in Venezuela and Mexico. Coke Femsa, which took on heavy debt to finance a string of acquisitions in recent years, is struggling to adapt as consumers turn away from its sugary drinks and Mexico, a core market, last year slapped a tax on such beverages. The company reported a profit of 3.075 billion pesos ($209 million), compared with 3.066 billion pesos a year earlier. A 12 percent decline in Mexico’s peso against the dollar in the fourth quarter drove up the costs of servicing debt denominated in the U.S. currency. The company, which is a joint venture between Coca-Cola Co  and Mexico’s Femsa, said a further decline in Venezuela’s bolivar currency also hurt its revenue, which fell 8.5 percent to 39.567 billion pesos in the quarter. Coke Femsa said that on a currency-neutral basis and excluding recent acquisitions, revenue rose 23.3 percent, but sales volumes remained weak. Excluding the acquisition of Spaipa in Brazil, sales volumes fell 0.4 percent to 878.6 million cases, Coke Femsa said. Operating profit declined 3.6 percent to 6.374 billion pesos.

628,KO,Coke CEO declines bonus as company performance falls short,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) said on Thursday its chief executive declined a $2.5 million bonus in 2014 while other top-level employees received lower-than-expected compensation as the world’s largest soda maker struggles to boost revenues amid sluggish demand for soft drinks. While Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent’s total compensation, which includes salary, stock options and changes in pension value, rose 23 percent to $25.2 million from the previous year, he didn’t take an annual bonus because of “difficult but necessary decisions” taken to accelerate sales.      Excluding a $7.1 million change in pension value, his actual remuneration was $18.1 million, down slightly from $18.2 million the previous year.  Coke has struggled to increase sales as consumers in developed markets shift from soda to healthier options. Carbonated soft drink sales have been declining for nearly a decade in the United States, according to the trade publication Beverage Digest.  Coke has diversified into faster-growing areas such as tea and energy drinks and announced cost-cutting plans at the end of 2014 to eliminate 1,600 to 1,800 positions as it aims to save $3 billion by 2019. “While we saw a number of positives in 2014, the company’s performance was not up to our high expectations,” Coke’s board said in a letter to shareholders on Thursday. “This performance is directly reflected in compensation decisions and how prior awards pay out.” Coke shares were up 1.6 percent at $40.40 in Thursday afternoon trading. Last year, the company faced criticism from Warren Buffet and other investors for its executive compensation plan. Its most vocal critic, David Winters of Wintergreen Advisers, which owns less than 1 percent of Coke, said the plan was dilutive to shareholders.  In a statement on Thursday, Wintergreen called for the board to replace Kent, saying “it’s encouraging to see that the Coca-Cola board is beginning to take a tougher line with management.” The company said in October it had adopted new guidelines limiting executive pay plans starting in 2015 and shifting away from stock options in favor of performance shares and cash awards. On the company’s most recent earnings call in February, Kent said that compensation would be tied to revenue. According to the company’s proxy filing, long-term incentives are now tied to net revenue growth for individual business units. Meanwhile, net revenue and profit before tax growth have been added as metrics to determine annual bonuses.

631,KO,Coke CEO's declined bonus not enough for pay critic Winters,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A decision by Coca-Cola Co’s chief executive to decline his 2014 bonus did not go far enough, a well-known pay critic said Friday, indicating the company could face more scrutiny of its compensation ahead of its shareholder meeting this spring.  While Coke Chairman and Chief Executive Muhtar Kent declined a $2.5 million bonus, that amount was offset by increases in the value of his stock-based awards, said David Winters, whose Wintergreen Advisers owns about 2.5 million Coke shares. “The problem is, he’s created an impression he took a hit, and he didn’t take the hit,” said Winters, who runs the $1.3 billion Wintergreen Fund, in an interview. Excluding a change in the value of Kent’s pension, his total compensation last year was $18.1 million, or about the same as in 2013, according to Coke’s pay disclosures. However, Coke spokesman Petro Kacur noted how the value of stock and option awards to Kent will be cut in half this year, to an estimated $7.7 million from the $15.8 million he received in 2014. The decline reflects performance challenges as Coke’s total return for shareholders last year was 5.25 percent, lagging the 13.69 percent total return on the benchmark S&P; 500 Index. Kent declined his 2014 bonus “in light of the difficult but necessary decisions required as the company implements strategic actions to accelerate growth,” according to Coke’s proxy statement released on Thursday.    Coke of Atlanta has struggled to boost revenue amid sluggish demand for soft drinks. Winters’ criticism last year made the company’s pay plan a battleground, though it was ultimately approved by shareholders. Coke spokesman Kacur said Kent’s pay details were clearly and fully disclosed. “Mr. Winters continues to make statements that are without merit in an attempt to try to grab headlines,” Kacur said via e-mail. After last year’s criticism Coke made changes that drew some praise from Winters and Liz Cohernour, Wintergreen’s chief operating officer, such as giving more details around pay calculations. Winters said his firm plans to cast its ballots against Coke’s pay in an advisory vote scheduled for the company’s annual meeting on April 29.

Plug Power, whose fuel cells offer a pollution-free alternative to power forklifts, said revenue more than doubled to $21.5 million for the fourth quarter. Analysts on average, however, had expected $26.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Plug Power, which counts Daimler AG, Wal-mart Stores Inc and Coca-Cola Co among its customers, has been under investors’ radar for uneven revenue recognition as some customers delayed payments to work out financing.

Cost of product revenue jumped 71 percent to $10.4 million. The company reiterated its 2015 sales forecast of at least $100 million. Analysts on average were expecting $107.1 million. Net loss attributable to common shareholders narrowed to $7.2 million, or 4 cents per share, from $28.9 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier when it recorded a $21 million charge related to stock warrants.

633,KO,Coke's zero tolerance for land grabs proves difficult to fulfill,"WASHINGTON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The Coca-Cola Co has made a good start in axing land grabs from its supply chain, but it must work harder in proving that its bottlers and sugar suppliers do not violate land rights, development experts told the company. Coke declared two years ago that land grabbing is unacceptable, and as a major buyer of sugar pledged to help protect land rights of local communities, including evaluating its top 16 cane sugar-sourcing countries by 2020. In the first of those reports released earlier this month, Coke said it found no evidence of land rights abuses by five sugar mills it buys from in Guatemala. However, those findings raised questions at a World Bank conference on Land and Poverty, given Guatemala’s long and often violent history of land conflict and human rights abuses. Karol Boudreaux, land expert at the Cloudburst Group consulting firm, said the report was too superficial, relying on the word of sugar mill operators without digging deeply into their land acquisition methods. “How did the owners acquire title documents? Were communities consulted? Were they compensated for their land? Were women’s title considered?” Boudreaux said at the World Bank session on Tuesday. “I cannot tell from the evidence that Coke presents,” she told Ed Potter, the company’s director of global workplace rights, who agreed to take her advice and improve the company’s review processes. In Cambodia, Coke faced criticism for benefiting from massive land thefts orchestrated by government officials for agribusinesses, including one of Coke’s major sugar suppliers, said David Pred of the human rights group Inclusive Development International. Thousands of Cambodians were violently displaced by police and military, who stole their crops, burned their homes and bulldozed their land for sugar companies, said Pred, managing director of the California-based organization. “What we are talking about here is grand theft,” he said, adding that Coke failed to conduct serious due diligence on its supplier. Coke’s Potter acknowledged that more work lies ahead for    the company to live up to its 2013 pledge of zero tolerance for land grabbing. But the company is determined to “do its best and get its arms around it”. “This is hard-going, difficult work,” he said.  Land tenure and legal issues are complicated, records incomplete or non-existent, and working through supply chains for 207 countries will take a long time. In India, for example, after three years and $25 million invested, Coke has yet to obtain clear land title for half of its bottling operators there, he said. Moreover there are few experts available to perform the high-quality, in-country checks needed of suppliers on the widening array of issues that range from slavery, child labor and land grabbing to environmental degradation, he said. Additionally, the guidance documents issued by human rights groups are multiplying, leaving no clear standards or measurements for declaring that supply chains are “clean” - let alone helping corporate boards decide when to pull out of supplier relationships, he and other participants said. Chris Jochnick, a director at Oxfam America, which scores the 10 biggest global food companies on social justice issues, said big corporations have a responsibility to remain engaged and use their influence on the world stage to create change around human rights issues. The exact rules of engagement though are a work in progress.  “At what point does zero tolerance for land grabs mean you cut off the supplier versus engaging with them?

636,KO,Pepsi takes over NBA sponsorship rights from Coke,"(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc is taking over league sponsorship rights for the National Basketball Association, ending a 28-year partnership that the league has had with Coca-Cola Co. Starting next season, PepsiCo will be the official food and beverage partner of the NBA, the Women’s National Basketball Association, NBA Development League, and USA Basketball, the company and association said in a joint statement. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

641,KO,Stocks end stronger as investors look beyond mixed earnings,"(Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended stronger on Wednesday as Visa’s potential expansion into China and talk of a turnaround at McDonald’s helped investors look beyond a mixed bag of quarterly earnings. All of the 10 major S&P; 500 sectors rose, with the tech index gaining 1.09 percent, propelled by Visa and MasterCard.  Visa ended 4.07 percent higher at $68.01 after hitting a record high of $69.98, while MasterCard closed up 3.91 percent after China said it would open up its market to foreign firms for clearing domestic bank card transactions. McDonald’s surged 3.13 percent after it said it was working on a plan to reverse its shrinking sales.  A week ago, more than 80 percent of the S&P; 500 companies to have posted their March-quarter earnings had beaten estimates. But with 121 reports now in, that number has slipped to 71.9 percent - just above the 70 percent earnings beat rate seen over the past four quarters. Many have blamed misses on revenue on a strong dollar for making their products more expensive overseas.     “We’re sorting through earnings. It’s mixed, but there’s no drastic change to the general economic recovery.” said Michael Sansoterra, portfolio manager of the RidgeWorth Large Cap Growth Fund in Atlanta. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 88.68 points, or 0.49 percent, to end at 18,038.27. The S&P; 500 gained 10.67 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,107.96 and the Nasdaq Composite added 21.07 points, or 0.42 percent, to 5,035.17. The Nasdaq Composite is now just 13 points shy of its record high close, set in March 2000, that signaled the limit of the dot-com bubble. By October 2001, 70 percent of its value had evaporated. “I do think there are valuation concerns, and some tech companies are trading at extremely high multiples,” said Derek Hoyt, chief investment officer at Minneapolis-based KDV Wealth Management. “People need to be cautious about what they buy, but I don’t think the situation calls for a 70 percent decline.” Major tech earnings on tap for Thursday include Amazon.com , which trades at over 400 times earnings, as well as Microsoft  and Google . Yum Brands ended 3.95 percent higher after the restaurant operator said late on Tuesday it was recovering from a meat scare in China and expected a strong year-end finish. After the bell, eBay was up 5 percent after it posted March-quarter earnings above estimates and said its growth was hurt by the strong dollar. Facebook Inc  posted its slowest growth in quarterly revenue in two years and its stock fell 2.1 percent in extended trade.    On Wednesday, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,737 to 1,230, for a 1.41-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,483 issues rose and 1,267 fell for a 1.17-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.

642,KO,"Coke profit tops estimates, announces bottler deals","(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) on Wednesday reported better than expected profit and revenue, helped by price increases in North America, as the beverage maker struggles to grow amid sluggish demand for soda. The world’s largest beverage maker showed the first revenue rise in nine quarters and shares gained 1.3 percent to $41.30 in midday trading.  U.S. sales of carbonated soft drinks have been declining for nearly a decade, with consumers shifting away from diet soda because of health concerns. Global Diet Coke sales volumes were down in the quarter, while Coke Zero, Sprite and other brands showed growth.  Coke has called 2015 a transition year as it attempts to figure out how to increase soda sales. It kept its 2015 forecast unchanged Wednesday and said it will spend up to $3 billion this year buying back stock.  “Investors will need patience here, but get paid a healthy dividend while they wait for better times,” Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones, said in an email.  The company has said it is targeting $3 billion in annual cost savings by 2019 and plans to reinvest part of that in marketing.  The company has said it will hand back, or refranchise, about two-thirds of its North American bottling territories by the end of 2017. With new agreements to give seven U.S. bottlers greater control of operations, Coke said it was on track to meet those goals.  “We still have much to do, and the full benefits from the announced initiatives are going to take time to materialize,” Chief Executive Muhtar Kent said on a conference call.  Coca-Cola’s net income attributable to shareholders fell to $1.56 billion, or 35 cents per share, in the quarter, from $1.63 billion, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned 48 cents per share in its fiscal first quarter ended April 3. Net operating revenue rose 1.3 percent to $10.71 billion. A strong dollar partly offset higher volumes and prices. Consumers bought more teas, dairy and water, but fewer juice drinks. Coke said the dollar will remain a headwind for the balance of 2015. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 42 cents per share on revenue of $10.66 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company benefited from six additional selling days and the timing of Easter.  Net operating revenue in North America, its biggest market, rose 6 percent to $5.10 billion. Revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and currency impact, increased 10 percent, helped by higher concentrate sales and prices, which rose 2 percent.

Mexicans are the world’s biggest consumers of soda per person, drinking an average 707 8-ounce (0.24 liter) servings each year, according to U.S. newsletter Beverage Digest. Since the tax change, sales of Coke products have fallen for Arca and its bigger rival, Coca-Cola Femsa.

648,KO,Coca-Cola faces renewed pressure over executive pay,"NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co faces renewed pressure over its executive pay from large proxy advisory firms ahead of a shareholder meeting on Wednesday and at least two major pension funds disclosed they voted against the company’s compensation. Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises pension funds, mutual funds and other money managers, has recommended investors cast advisory votes against the pay of the Atlanta beverage company’s top leaders, including chairman and chief executive Muhtar Kent, who earned $25.2 million in 2014. Another proxy adviser, Glass Lewis & Co, is recommending investors support the pay, but said in a report it is concerned that bonus limits at the company are too high.  The tough reviews from the advisers come despite changes Coke made to its equity plan last fall, adopting new guidelines that would be less heavily weighted toward stock options. The company said it revamped its plan based on shareholder feedback. While it called those changes positive, ISS said in a recent report that “it remains to be seen whether they will lead to concrete performance improvement.” Meanwhile, two large pension fund overseers, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, which each hold less than 1 percent of Coke shares, have already voted against the pay detailed in Coke’s proxy released in March, according to disclosures on their websites. While the result of the shareholder vote on pay will not be binding on Coke, weak support would likely lead to more criticism after the company faced an investor revolt over its executive pay last year. At the time one of its largest investors, Warren Buffett, abstained from voting for the company’s 2014 equity plan and called it excessive.  Spokespeople for CalSTRS and Canada Pension declined to comment on their latest votes. In October, a CalSTRS spokesman had called Coke’s new equity guidelines a positive move. Coke said while it respects CalSTRS’ vote, “we are seeing support from a number of investors on executive compensation through ongoing shareowner engagement,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday. “Our executive compensation is tied to the performance of the company and linked to the long-term interests of shareowners.” Michael McCauley, governance officer for the Florida State Board of Administration, which has Coke shares, said it supported Coke’s executive pay in this year’s advisory vote because of the changes the company made last fall.

Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises pension funds, mutual funds and other money managers, has recommended investors cast advisory votes against the pay of the Atlanta beverage company’s top leaders, including chairman and chief executive Muhtar Kent, who earned $25.2 million in 2014. Another proxy adviser, Glass Lewis & Co, is recommending investors support the pay, but said in a report it is concerned that bonus limits at the company are too high. The tough reviews from the advisers come despite changes Coke made to its equity plan last fall, adopting new guidelines that would be less heavily weighted toward stock options. The company said it revamped its plan based on shareholder feedback. While it called those changes positive, ISS said in a recent report that “it remains to be seen whether they will lead to concrete performance improvement.” Meanwhile, two large pension fund overseers, the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, which each hold less than 1 percent of Coke shares, have already voted against the pay detailed in Coke’s proxy released in March, according to disclosures on their websites. While the result of the shareholder vote on pay will not be binding on Coke, weak support would likely lead to more criticism after the company faced an investor revolt over its executive pay last year. At the time one of its largest investors, Warren Buffett, abstained from voting for the company’s 2014 equity plan and called it excessive. Spokespeople for CalSTRS and Canada Pension declined to comment on their latest votes. In October, a CalSTRS spokesman had called Coke’s new equity guidelines a positive move. Coke said while it respects CalSTRS’ vote, “we are seeing support from a number of investors on executive compensation through ongoing shareowner engagement,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday. “Our executive compensation is tied to the performance of the company and linked to the long-term interests of shareowners.” Michael McCauley, governance officer for the Florida State Board of Administration, which has Coke shares, said it supported Coke’s executive pay in this year’s advisory vote because of the changes the company made last fall.

Coke said preliminary results from its annual shareholders meeting in Atlanta showed 80.4 percent of votes cast were in favor of its executive compensation, about 10 percentage points below the average for a company in the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX.  While the vote is only advisory, it indicates shareholder sentiment, and the company faced an investor revolt over its executive pay last year. “The vote should pressure the Coca-Cola board to not only reform pay practices further but to move faster on fixing Coca-Cola’s business,” said a statement from David Winters, chief executive officer of Wintergreen Advisers, Coke’s most vocal critic on executive pay.  Coke, which is struggling to grow amid weak demand for carbonated soft drinks, said some of its largest shareholders supported its executive compensation. “This outcome reflects support for the enhancements made in the past year to strengthen executive compensation as well as the direct engagement with shareowners,” the Atlanta company said in a statement. Last fall, Coke revised its equity plan to make it less heavily weighted toward stock options.  Pay consulting firm Semler Brossy said shareholder support for executive pay among S&P; 500 companies averaged 92 percent in 2014. It was running at a similar level so far this year among 65 companies that have held their advisory votes.

The remarks from Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), come as several of his core holdings, including International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and Coca-Cola (KO.N), have showed declining revenue trends in recent years. Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire had bought more shares of IBM during the first quarter, and forecast higher earnings at the company over the next 10 years. He also praised IBM’s stock buyback program, which he said had been “enormously beneficial” for shareholders, though he stressed that in general, buyback programs should be done based on share price and not as an all-purpose strategy. Coca-Cola continues to have a “strong competitive position,” he said. Referring to the broader market, Buffett said equity valuation would appear “on the high side” if interest rates were normalized from their currently low levels, while U.S. bonds currently appear “very overvalued.”  The comments on equity valuation repeated remarks he had made over the weekend at an annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting.  While he acknowledged that investors expect interest rates to rise this year, Buffett said it would be difficult for the United States to raise rates “significantly” if European rates remain low.

657,KO,UPDATE 2-Starbucks moves Ethos water bottling out of drought-hit California,"(Adds Coca-Cola comment, bottled water consumption data) By Lisa Baertlein LOS ANGELES, May 8 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp on Friday said it would stop sourcing water for its Ethos Water brand in California, which is in the fourth year of a serious drought that has prompted the state’s first-ever mandatory cuts in water use. Beginning in May and over the next six months, Starbucks said it plans to move production to its Pennsylvania supplier. The Seattle-based coffee chain also is looking for a new source and supplier for its West Coast Ethos Water distribution. The announcement comes a week after the magazine Mother Jones published a report showing that Ethos Water was sourced in areas deemed to be in “exceptional drought.” Starbucks bought privately held Ethos Brands LLC for $8 million in April 2005. It does not break out sales for Ethos. Starbucks donates 5 cents for every bottle of water sold to the Ethos Water Fund, which is part of the Starbucks foundation. Starbucks says that so far, more than $12.3 million has been granted to help support water, sanitation and hygiene education programs in water-stressed countries in Africa, Indonesia and Latin America. Starbucks says its California cafes have cut their water use by 26 percent since 2008. Several other large bottled water sellers source water from California, among which are Coca-Cola Co’s Dasani brand and PepsiCo Inc’s Aquafina. Coca-Cola’s California facilities no longer use water for things like truck washing and landscaping, spokeswoman Nancy Limon said in an email. But Coca-Cola is not moving bottled water operations out of the state. “We are committed to keeping jobs in California, while reducing our water use and replenishing water back to nature,” Limon said, adding that Coca-Cola is involved in several water stewardship projects around the state. Representatives from PepsiCo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The total volume of bottled water consumed in the United States hit 11 billion gallons last year, up more than 7 percent from 2013. That translated into an average of 34 gallons per person, according to the International Bottled Water Association, citing data from the Beverage Marketing Corp. Starbucks shares gained 0.9 percent to close at $49.78 on Friday.

659,KO,"UPDATE 1-Buffett's Berkshire adds to favorites IBM, Wells Fargo","(Adds details of holdings, comment, byline) By Jonathan Stempel May 15 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc  on Friday said it has boosted its holdings in some of the billionaire’s favorite companies, including Wells Fargo & Co  and International Business Machines Corp. The changes were disclosed in a regulatory filing detailing Berkshire’s U.S.-listed stock portfolio as of March 31. Berkshire also boosted its share stake in U.S. Bancorp , another large holding, while other portfolio managers adjusted their stakes in several companies. No new stocks were added to the portfolio, which shrank to $107.1 billion from $109.4 billion in December. Berkshire bought $1.62 billion and sold $1.11 billion of equities overall. Buffett has long praised his “Big Four” stock holdings Wells Fargo, IBM, Coca-Cola Co and American Express Co, which comprise roughly 58 percent of Berkshire’s equity investments. Buffett has stuck with them despite recent adversity including IBM’s stagnant stock price, concern over Coca-Cola’s sugary products and executive pay structure, and a February court ruling that American Express violated antitrust law. “Too many fund managers are more interested in seeing stocks to which they have committed perform well” in the short term, said Andy Kern, a University of Missouri professor who teaches a class on Buffett’s investment strategies. “Berkshire has such a long time horizon that it can afford to watch the stock price go down so it can buy more.” Friday’s regulatory filing does not disclose who makes which investment at Berkshire. Smaller investments are often made by portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who may succeed Buffett as chief investment officers after he departs. In the first quarter, Berkshire raised its stake in Wells Fargo by about 2 percent to 470.3 million shares, and in IBM by roughly 3 percent to 79.6 million shares. The U.S. Bancorp stake grew about 5 percent to 83.8 million shares. Other holdings that grew include Deere & Co, Liberty Global Plc, Phillips 66, Precision Castparts Corp and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. Holdings declined in Bank of New York Mellon Corp, Charter Communications Inc, National Oilwell Varco Inc , Viacom Inc and Wabco Holdings Inc. Berkshire also owns more than 80 businesses, including the Burlington Northern railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and Geico car insurance. Buffett, 84, this month celebrated his 50th anniversary running his Omaha, Nebraska-based company, whose market value is fifth-highest among publicly-traded U.S. companies.

663,KO,"WRAPUP 7-World soccer rocked by U.S., Swiss arrests of officials for graft","(Adds ex-FIFA vice president Warner court appearance, statements by FIFA sponsors, Nike and Coca-Cola) * Nine FIFA officials, five corporate executives indicted * Seven top soccer figures arrested in Switzerland * Authorities seek arrests of others - U.S. prosecutors * High-ranking officials in Switzerland for FIFA Congress * Swiss criminal probe related to Russia, Qatar World Cups By Mike Collett, Brian Homewood and Nate Raymond ZURICH/NEW YORK, May 27 (Reuters) - The world’s most popular sport was plunged into turmoil on Wednesday as seven senior soccer officials were arrested on U.S. corruption charges and faced extradition from Switzerland, whose authorities also announced a criminal investigation into the awarding of the next two World Cups. The arrests in a dawn raid at a five-star Zurich hotel mark an unprecedented blow against soccer’s governing body FIFA, which for years has been dogged by allegations of corruption but always escaped major criminal cases. U.S. prosecutors said they aimed to make more arrests but would not be drawn on whether FIFA President Sepp Blatter, for long the most powerful man in the sport, was a target of the probe. Blatter, 79, is standing for re-election to a fifth term at the FIFA Congress in Zurich on Friday, and FIFA said the vote would go ahead as planned. The European soccer body UEFA called for the election to be postponed, saying “the European associations will have to consider carefully if they should even attend this Congress.” In a scathing indictment of corruption in soccer, U.S. authorities said nine officials and five sports media and promotions executives were charged in cases involving more than $150 million in bribes over a period of 24 years. They said their investigation exposed complex money laundering schemes, millions of dollars in untaxed incomes and tens of millions in offshore accounts held by FIFA officials. Swiss police arrested the seven, all from the Latin American and Caribbean region, and detained them pending extradition proceedings to the United States, which could take years if they contest the process. The Federal Office of Justice in Switzerland said that six would contest extradition, but that one person agreed to be extradited. “As charged in the indictment, the defendants fostered a culture of corruption and greed that created an uneven playing field for the biggest sport in the world,” said Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey. “Undisclosed and illegal payments, kickbacks, and bribes became a way of doing business at FIFA.” Blatter, who has denied and survived allegations of his involvement in corruption, said in a statement: “Let me be clear: such misconduct has no place in football and we will ensure that those who engage in it are put out of the game.” The statement also said that FIFA welcomed the actions and the investigations “and believe that it will help to reinforce measures that FIFA has already taken to root out any wrongdoing in football.” Separate from the U.S. investigation, Swiss prosecutors said they had opened their own criminal proceedings against unidentified people on suspicion of mismanagement and money laundering related to the awarding of rights to host the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 event in Qatar. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch told reporters at a news conference in New York her office did not want to impede the 2018 and 2022 World Cups but looked forward to working with Swiss authorities investigating the award of the tournaments. “FIFA has a lot of soul searching to do,” she said. The indictment accused the officials of using a variety of schemes to take kickbacks and bribes from sports marketing firms connected to major tournaments, and also alleged corruption in the selection of the 2010 World Cup host and the 2011 FIFA presidential election. One of those indicted, former FIFA Vice President Jack Warner of Trinidad, solicited $10 million in bribes from the South African government to host the 2010 World Cup, the Justice Department said. Warner directed a number of co-conspirators to arrange the payment, which was eventually sent from a FIFA account in Switzerland to a Bank of America account in New York that Warner controlled, the indictment said. The South African Football Association called the bribe allegations “baseless and untested.” Warner, former FIFA vice president and executive committee member of CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central America, Caribbean Association Football), said in a statement that he was innocent of any charges. Warner surrendered to the police mid-afternoon in Port of Spain, made an initial court appearance on 12 charges of corruption, money laundering and racketeering and was granted TT$2.5 million ($400,000) bail. The United States took jurisdiction of the case in part because the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI secured the cooperation of U.S. citizen Chuck Blazer, a former top FIFA official, who U.S. officials said had not paid taxes for years. Blazer’s lawyer, Eric Corngold, declined to comment. Kelly Currie, the acting U.S. attorney in Brooklyn said Wednesday’s charges brought in the New York City borough represent “the beginning of our effort, not the end.” Early Wednesday, FBI agents carrying bags and boxes to execute a search warrant went into the group’s office in Miami Beach. Agents also used a search warrant at the offices of Traffic Sports in Miami. CONCACAF said in a statement it was “deeply concerned by today’s developments” and that “the Confederation will continue to cooperate with the authorities to its fullest capacity.” In addition to Blazer, 70, others who pleaded guilty were José Hawilla, 71, owner of the Traffic Group, a sports marketing firm founded in Brazil, and two of his companies; Daryan Warner, 46, and Daryll Warner, 40, sons of Jack Warner. Their lawyers declined comment or were not available to comment. “It is clear that the case is based in large part on some cooperating insiders who have already plead guilty,” said Miami lawyer David Weinstein, former prosecutor. The FIFA officials appeared to have walked into a trap set by U.S. and Swiss authorities. The arrests were made at dawn at a plush Zurich hotel, the Baur au Lac, where officials are staying before the vote. Suites at the hotel cost up to $4,000 a night. The arrests could have implications for sponsorship. The indictment said that in 1996, an unidentified global sports company agreed to pay $160 million over 10 years to become Brazil’s exclusive footwear, apparel, accessories, and equipment supplier. That was an apparent reference to Nike Inc , which sponsored the Brazil national team. Nike said that it was cooperating with authorities. “Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport...,” a company statement said. The indictment said that the company agreed to additional financial terms not in the initial contract. This included paying an additional $40 million to “a Traffic affiliate with a Swiss bank account” and referred to as “marketing fees.” German sportswear company Adidas, long associated with FIFA, said the soccer body should do more to establish transparent compliance standards. Anheuser-Busch InBev, whose Budweiser brand is a sponsor of the 2018 World Cup, said it was closely monitoring developments at FIFA. Coca-Cola Co, another FIFA sponsor, said the charges had “tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations.” Officials said that following the arrests, accounts at several banks in Switzerland had been blocked. The officials arrested in Zurich are: Jeffrey Webb, vice-president of world body FIFA, president of North and Central American body CONCACAF and head of soccer in the Cayman Islands; Eduardo Li, who runs Costa Rica’s soccer federation; Julio Rocha, who headed Nicaragua’s federation; Eugenio Figueredo, another FIFA vice-president who used to run Uruguayan soccer; Rafael Esquivel who is the sport’s boss in Venezuela; Jose Maria Marin, who used to be the head of Brazil’s federation; and Costas Takkas, another CONCACAF official. Those detained or their representatives were not available to comment. Lynch said in a statement that the charges span “at least two generations of soccer officials who, as alleged, have abused their positions of trust to acquire millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks.” The international governing body of football collects billions of dollars in revenue, mostly from sponsorship and television rights for World Cups. It has been dogged by reports of corruption which it says it investigates itself. “The chickens are finally coming home to roost and this sounds like a hugely significant development for FIFA,” said Damian Collins, a British member of parliament who founded the reform group New FIFA Now. FIFA’s decision to award the World Cup to Qatar, a tiny desert country with no domestic tradition of soccer, was heavily criticised by soccer officials in Western countries. FIFA was forced to acknowledge that it is too hot to play soccer there in the summer when the tournament is traditionally held, forcing schedules around the globe to be rewritten to move the event. Qatar’s stock market fell sharply as news of the Swiss investigation emerged.

664,KO,UPDATE 4-Visa threatens to ditch FIFA as sponsor dismay mounts,"* Visa says disappointment with FIFA is “profound” * Consumers attack brands on Twitter * Nike says cooperating with authorities * Adidas, Coca-Cola Hyundai, McDonald’s, Anheuser-Busch concerned * World Cup seen as too lucrative to ditch   (Adds comment, background) By Anjali Athavaley and Emma Thomasson NEW YORK/BERLIN, May 28 (Reuters) - Visa Inc has told FIFA it could end its sponsorship if soccer’s governing body does not act fast to restore the reputation of the game after senior officials were arrested on  corruption charges. The statement from Visa was the strongest so far as sponsors lined up to express concern about the scandal engulfing the world’s most popular sport and their customers took to social media to threaten a boycott of brands associated with FIFA. Sponsors are trying to balance the growing sensitivity of consumers to corruption, human rights abuses and environmental issues against their relationship with the organisation that holds the keys to a billion soccer fans worldwide. “Our disappointment and concern with FIFA in light of today’s developments is profound. As a sponsor, we expect FIFA to take swift and immediate steps to address these issues within its organization,” Visa said. “This starts with rebuilding a culture with strong ethical practices,” it said. “Should FIFA fail to do so, we have informed them that we will reassess our sponsorship.” U.S. prosecutors issued an indictment on Wednesday accusing nine officials from soccer’s world governing body and five sports media and promotions executives of bribes involving more than $150 million over 24 years. Airline Emirates and Japanese electronics maker Sony Corp announced in November they would not renew deals with FIFA, although rivals Qatar Airways and Samsung  are reportedly in talks to replace them. Emirates and Sony were among FIFA’s six main partners who together paid a total of $177 million in 2014 for the right to advertise in World Cup stadiums and use the FIFA trademark. A source familiar with the Sony decision said suspected corruption was one factor behind Sony’s withdrawal although the main reason was the high cost of the sponsorship deal. Sponsors have long faced risks to their brands from sports scandals ranging from doping to match fixing to misbehaviour of top players on and off the pitch. Sponsors including Nike Inc dropped American cyclist Lance Armstrong in 2012 after he was banned for doping, but Germany’s Adidas decided last year to stick with Uruguay’s Luis Suarez after FIFA banned him for nine matches for biting an Italy defender. “Brands have to take a longer-term view. Any sport is littered with controversy on and off the field,” said Paul Smith, founder of sports marketing research group Repucom. “What fans care about most of all is the game itself rather than the business of the game... Being a sponsor of FIFA implies you are a sponsor of the game, not of the organisation.” FIFA’s longest standing partners are Adidas and Coca-Cola Co . Adidas has been the provider of the World Cup match ball since 1970 and has a partnership lasting until 2030, while the current deal for Coca-Cola, which has had a formal association since 1974 and has advertised in every World Cup stadium since 1950, lasts until 2022. That perhaps explains why they stopped short of threatening to cut ties like Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit card company, which only became a FIFA partner in 2007 and recently extended the relationship until 2022. “This lengthy controversy has tarnished the mission and ideals of the FIFA World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns about these serious allegations,” Coca Cola said. Adidas, which is the world’s biggest manufacturer of soccer balls, boots and shirts, side stepped outright criticism, calling instead for FIFA “to continue to establish and follow transparent compliance standards”. Its shares fell 1.5 percent on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nike, which is not a FIFA partner but is challenging Adidas’ dominance in soccer by sponsoring many of the world’s top players and teams, said it was cooperating with authorities after it was indirectly identified in the U.S. indictment in relation to a 1996 deal with the Brazil team. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch declined to comment on whether there was any liability for companies that had won marketing rights and if they were being investigated. But she said “the investigation is continuing and covers all aspects.” She declined to comment when asked if one of the companies was Nike. Nike later said in a statement it was “concerned by the very serious allegations, adding: “Nike believes in ethical and fair play in both business and sport and strongly opposes any form of manipulation or bribery.” FIFA’s main sponsors were already getting uneasy even before the latest revelations. Adidas, Visa and Coca-Cola all made statements last week pushing FIFA to take seriously the issue of rights for migrant workers in Qatar, responding to reports of abuses at the 2022 World Cup construction sites. That came after campaigners designed spoof ads for major FIFA sponsors subverting their brand images, including a Coca-Cola can dripping with oil and the iconic three stripes of Adidas tweaked to look like a line of gravestones. The pressure only mounted after Wednesday’s news, with social media full of appeals for brands to cut ties with FIFA. “Adidas, Visa, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Budweiser, Hyundai: stop supporting corrupt FIFA or I stop buying your brands,” wrote Stefan-Joerg Goebel on Twitter. The Institute of Directors (IoD), a leading UK authority on corporate governance, said risks were mounting for sponsors. “They have a responsibility to their shareholders to make certain that the company’s cash is not going towards sporting events mired in bribery and corruption allegations,” said Roger Barker, IoD director of corporate governance. South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor, the sole Asian FIFA partner for the 2018 World Cup due to be held in Russia, said it was “extremely concerned” about the legal proceedings, while Bud-owner Anheuser-Busch InBev and McDonald’s Corp said they were in contact with FIFA. Australian sportswear company SKINS, which announced in a tongue-in-cheek campaign in January that it was the first “official” FIFA non-sponsor, urged the brands to clean up FIFA. “The only people FIFA will listen to are the sponsors. The real money is with the broadcasters but their brands aren’t exposed in the same way as the sponsors,” said SKINS chairman Jaimie Fuller. But brand experts were sceptical of a mass exodus of FIFA sponsors. “Football is one of the few global properties that enables you to connect with people around the world,” said Interbrand Chief Executive Jez Frampton. Rob Prazmark, president of 21 Sports & Entertainment Marketing Group, a global sports and event sales agency agreed: “These sponsors put a lot of money into associating with the World Cup,” he said. “They’ll give them a little bit of time to get their house in order.”   (Additional reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir, Nate Raymond, Steve Slater, Ando Ritsuko and Hyunjoo Jin; Editing by David Stamp and Giles Elgood)",5282015,http://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-fifa-sponsors/update-4-visa-threatens-to-ditch-fifa-as-sponsor-dismay-mounts-idUSL1N0YJ06M20150528

671,KO,Coca-Cola HBC says keeps investing in Russia juice production,"MOSCOW, June 4 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola HBC, the world’s second-largest bottler of Coca-Cola brand drinks, continues to invest in juice production in Russia, confident of the market’s recovery, its Russian head said on Thursday. Stefanos Vafeidis, Russia General Manager at Coca-Cola HBC Eurasia, told Reuters the company would open a new juice production line at its plant in the southern Russian city of Rostov next week. “We continue - for instance now in juice production - to increase our production capacity,” Vafeidis said at a retail conference in Moscow. “We continue to invest because we believe in the long-term perspective of Russia, we are not here for either six months or one year,” he said. “Yes, there is a crisis, yes, consumption temporarily, we believe, is down ... It will come back.” Vafeidis said per-capita consumption in Russia was still low compared to many other European countries and should start catching up when the economy recovers from weak oil prices and Western sanctions over Ukraine. “The answer to crisis is get closer to the consumer, give more innovative products, take care of your pricing to be relevant,” he added. “This crisis will pass, brighter days will come and whoever is ready and whoever is here and does the right thing, he will enjoy it.” Last year, Coca-Cola HBC added eight new juice production lines at Multon, its Russian joint venture with Coca-Cola Co , and at its carbonated drink plants while Coca-Cola Co closed its juice unit, Nidan. In 2015, apart from Rostov, Coca-Cola HBC will open at least one more new juice manufacturing line, a spokeswoman for the bottler said on Thursday.

672,KO,Greek bank closures may deplete supermarket shelves,"* Ban on int’l bank transfers crimps local operations * Finance Ministry: Firms can fax requests to wire money * Firms are finding solutions but remain cautious By Martinne Geller and Lefteris Karagiannopoulos LONDON/ATHENS, July 3 (Reuters) - A halt to international payments from Greek bank accounts is hurting Greek businesses and their foreign partners and threatening supplies of vital goods like food and clothing into the debt-crippled country. With banks closed, people limited to withdrawing 60 euros  ($66.62) per day and Greece’s future in the euro possibly hinging on a referendum on Sunday, Greek shoppers have been stocking up on essentials like sugar, flour, pasta, rice, beans, canned and paper goods. Shelves remain full for now as retailers have inventories in storage. But capital controls put in place after Greece defaulted on a loan to international creditors have essentially frozen companies’ cash flows and credit. This has severely hampered production and shipping, meaning that goods are in finite supply. With this week’s rush to supermarkets, shortages could be around the corner although budget limits are providing some cushion. “At this stage there is no problem of shortages. There is sufficient stock in our warehouses and we renew it frequently,” said Melina Varoutsikou, spokeswoman for Sklavenitis, one of Greece’s largest supermarket chains. “However, nobody knows how much these can last. It all depends on which product we are talking about.” With no international bank transfers, imports and exports have been clobbered, according to SEV-Hellenic Federation of Enterprises, meaning there are fewer raw materials, even for local production, and less petrol available for deliveries. The Greek finance ministry said on Friday that companies wishing to process bank transfers abroad to pay suppliers must submit a request to the Committee of Approval of Bank Transfers through their commercial bank. The ministry said companies can get further information by going to their home branch or calling their bank’s central number. But for quicker processing, the ministry recommended faxing the requests. It made no mention of e-mail, the medium often used for international business. Meanwhile, sellers of perishable items like fresh fruit and vegetables stand to realize losses as shipments are stalled. “The food and beverage industry suffers heavily,” said George Xirogiannis, director of industrial and sectoral policies for SEV, a trade group involved in lobbying the government to reconsider its position on cross-border transactions. “Cash flow problems are spread throughout the economy, regardless of the size of the enterprise.” Large multinationals such as Nestle, Procter & Gamble, L’Oreal and Coca-Cola operate in Greece and could see a sales hit, since wholesalers that lack online banking facilities or international accounts have been unable to execute any payments abroad. “Payment transactions have been severely affected,” said an official from an international consumer goods company who spoke on condition of anonymity. Over the past five years the retail market in Greece has shrunk by nearly a quarter to about $29.7 billion this year, according to estimates from market research firm Euromonitor International, as its austerity-hit population of 11 million has cut back on everything from groceries to clothes to appliances. The less essential the product, the deeper the drop. “Unnecessary items saw a dramatic decline already. With what’s happening now we expect the decline to be even deeper,” said Euromonitor analyst Dimitrios Dimakakos, based in London. He noted however that retailers in Greece were reporting sharp increases in sales, versus a year ago, of staple items in the days since Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras announced a referendum on the country’s bailout. With Tsipras’s leftist Syriza party having come to power in January, multinational companies have had months to plan for various scenarios and to consider options such as sending Greek profits to neighbouring countries to ease payments to suppliers, or by raising money from physical assets in Greece. “They have done all the scenarios. They are ready to face the crisis,” said Spyros Christodoulatos, managing partner of consulting firm CS Compass, adding that the Greek business community remained on edge ahead of Sunday’s referendum. Yet Yannis Perrotis, managing director of Atria Property Services, a Greek affiliate of CBRE Group that offers real estate consulting services to investors and developers, said some Greek subsidiaries of international companies had stopped getting supplies from parent companies. “It’s a really peculiar situation, like a patient whose oxygen level is going down by the day and the heart will stop at some point as the systems stop functioning,” Perrotis said. The head of one of Greece’s largest wholesale clothing importers said that since the capital controls were announced, the market has been frozen, with suppliers demanding different forms of security on orders, probably cash. Credit insurers are reconsidering offering coverage to companies carrying out trade with Greece, according to the executive, who declined to be identified by name. “Last season, when things started looking up for the first time since 2009, they were willing to provide Greek companies in our sector with a certain credit limit. They are now having second thoughts,” he said. “The good scenario is that there is going to be a drop in consumption in our markets, so we try to be proactive and bring less goods inside the country.”   ($1 = 0.9007 euros)   (Additional reporting by Tom Pfeiffer in London; Editing by Mark Heinrich)",7032015,http://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-greece-consumergoods/greek-bank-closures-may-deplete-supermarket-shelves-idUSL8N0ZJ2PN20150703

Coca-Cola Co and McDonald’s Corp both made it clear that they are deeply unhappy with the way FIFA is governed and want major change.  Their intervention comes only days ahead of a crucial FIFA executive committee meeting on Monday at which both possible reforms and a timetable to elect a new president to replace Sepp Blatter, who has run FIFA for 17 years, will be discussed.

Coca-Cola urged Zurich-based FIFA to support the creation of an independent body to reform the way it is run. “We have written to FIFA and asked them to support an independent third-party commission for reforms,” a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola said on Friday.

Coke has called 2015 a transition year as it tries to cut costs and boost sales of its mainstay carbonated soft drinks.  Global sales volumes of its sodas rose 1 percent in the second quarter, helped by growing demand for Coke Zero, Sprite and Fanta.  Sales volumes of still beverages were up 5 percent, with increases in ready-to-drink tea and packaged water offsetting declines in juice and juice drinks.  For the second straight quarter, sales rose in North America, which accounts for nearly half of the total. Prices there increased 4 percent in the quarter, while volume was up 2 percent.  Coke effectively raised prices by switching to smaller-sized packaging, and it boosted ad spending for its brands.  Expanded distribution of energy drink maker Monster Beverage Corp’s products (MNST.O) in North America contributed to the increase. The company bought a stake in Monster last year as a way to diversify into faster-growing beverage categories.  Coke’s net revenue fell 3 percent to $12.16 billion, but it would have increased 4 percent without the impact of the strong dollar, acquisitions and divestitures. Analysts on average were expecting $12.06 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to shareholders rose nearly 20 percent to $3.11 billion, or 71 cents per share.  The company said it would buy back shares worth up to $2.0 billion to $2.5 billion this year. Earlier, it had earmarked $2 billion to $3 billion. “We looked at where we were for the first half of the year, and we looked at cash, particularly because of the currency getting worse in the back half and just tightened the range,” Chief Financial Officer Kathy Waller said on a conference call. Cowen and Co analyst Vivien Azer said in a note that the tighter range seemed “consistent with the share repurchase revision that we saw last October, where the company narrowed their outlook for buybacks.” Coke’s shares were down 0.3 percent at $41.05 in midday trading.

FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said that Coca-Cola, Visa and McDonald’s had written asking for information about what was being done to clean up governance of the sport. He admitted that scandal had made it difficult to attract new sponsors. “Clearly, there were a number of sponsors, mainly three, its Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Visa, who have expressed and sent a letter to FIFA, asking for information,” he told a new conference in the Russian city of St Petersburg. “Two or three days ago we received a letter from all of them offering to meet together, so there will there will be a meeting next month.” Criticism of FIFA’s governance came to a head in May when U.S. prosecutors indicted nine soccer officials, most of whom had FIFA positions, and five marketing and broadcasting company executives over a range of alleged offences. These included fraud, money-laundering and racketeering. Valcke added that FIFA has been keeping its partners informed of developments. “We sent (information) to all our commercial partners, not just those three,” he said. “We sent them an update, a summary, of all that has happened within FIFA since 2012 since the first reform process started, (of) what has been changed within FIFA’s administration and around FIFA.”  “Definitely, the current situation doesn’t help to finalize any new agreements, it’s a fact, and I’m sure that until the next election, until February 26, there (will be) no major (sponsorship) announcements.” FIFA President Sepp Blatter is stepping down and a replacement will be chosen in February.

683,KO,U.S. private sector vows to ante up on climate finance,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some of the biggest U.S. corporate names on Monday offered their support - and billions of dollars in green financing pledges - to buttress the Obama administration’s quest for a global agreement on combating climate change. Google, Apple, Goldman Sachs and 10 other well-known companies joined the White House in launching the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, a campaign that the White House said would inject $140 billion in low-carbon investments into the global economy. Massive private sector commitments are seen by participants as essential to getting a global agreement on climate change in Paris in December. Emerging nations have demanded that any agreement include tens of billions of dollars in financing from developed nations to help their economies adapt to a low-carbon future. Although not all the corporate pledges represented new commitments, Monday’s announcement showed the administration’s ability to get private sector buy-in for international climate change financing.  Mindy Lubber, president of environmental investor group Ceres, applauded the announcements but said the White House cannot rely solely on these pledges. “Voluntary commitments alone will not get us the meaningful reductions we need,” she said. “Strong carbon-reducing policies are hugely important.” None of the companies involved in Monday’s announcement were from the fossil fuel sector of the economy, though the White House said there could be a second round of pledges in the fall ahead of the Paris conference. Other companies included General Motors, Bank of America, Microsoft and Coca Cola, many of which also announced measures to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions and deploy more clean energy. The White House said the companies’ promises would lead to at least 1,600 megawatts of new renewable energy being brought on line. Water-use intensity would be reduced by 15 percent and the companies would target zero net deforestation in their supply chains.  Google, which claims to be the biggest corporate purchaser of renewable power globally, pledged to triple those purchases over the next decade.  In a blog post on Google’s website, CEO Eric Schmidt said while the private sector can play a leadership role on climate change, it needs political certainty to encourage companies to scale up their investments. “We need the world’s political leaders to confirm that investments in clean energy are sound, and that the laws and policies meant to enable such investment will be designed for the long term,” Schmidt wrote. Among other elements of the plan, Apple, one of the 13 companies, pledged to bring nearly 300 MW of renewable energy online in five states and the Sichuan province in China. Berkshire Hathaway said it will retire 75 percent of its coal-fueled generating capacity in Nevada by 2019.  Soft-drink manufacturers Coca Cola and Pepsi Co. vowed to reduce the carbon footprint of their businesses: Pepsi pledging to expand its sustainable farming initiative for its supply chain, and Coca Cola saying it would reduce the carbon footprint of the “drink in your hand” by 25 percent by 2020. Obama needs voluntary private sector participation because the Republican-controlled Congress, which has power over public financing, appears reluctant to authorize extensive spending on renewable energy investments.

685,KO,Earnings-day blues drags UK shares down,"* FTSE 100 down 0.5 pct, in line with Europe * Travis Perkins, Standard Life down after results * Smiths Group lifted by report of activist stake * Coca-Cola HBC falls after Goldman downgrade LONDON, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Top UK shares opened on a downbeat note on Tuesday, with a mixed bag of corporate earnings and weakness in the technology sector offsetting reports of activist stake-building. The FTSE 100 index was down 0.4 percent at 0804 GMT, broadly in line with peers across Europe, though it has so far this year underperformed the region as a commodities sell-off and worries over China demand weigh on London-listed mining and energy shares. While early trading on Tuesday saw something of a rebound for miners, with investors focusing on their ability to cut spending in the face of the commodity price drop, sluggish trade kept energy stocks such as BG Group and BP in negative territory. Technology stocks including ARM Holdings were also weak after rocky Asia trading that saw Apple suppliers fall. “The continuation of this commodity drag has meant the UK index underwent another lifeless open,” said Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex. Home-improvement company Travis Perkins was among the FTSE 100’s worst performers after it published a trading update that it said was in line with forecasts, though some analysts said the figures were disappointing. Insurer Standard Life saw first-half profits dented by a drop in sales of fixed-rate annuities. The shares fell nearly 3 percent. International Airlines Group also fell after reiterating annual growth but slightly reduced capacity growth. Bottling company Coca-Cola HBC fell after a broker downgrade from Goldman Sachs, which cited pressures on revenue growth and profitability and a lack of takeover potential. Deal hopes were much stronger with Smiths Group, whose shares jumped more than 6 percent on reports of stake-building in Smiths Group.

686,KO,Three European Coca-Cola bottlers to merge,"LONDON (Reuters) - Three European bottlers of Coca-Cola (KO.N) drinks have agreed to merge in what will be one of the continent’s largest consumer products deals ever, as they hope greater scale and cost cutting will revitalize sluggish soft drink sales.  Coca-Cola Enterprises CCE.N said on Thursday it would combine with Coca-Cola Iberian Partners (CCIP) and the German bottling business of Coca-Cola to create a new company that will be the world’s largest independent bottler of Coke drinks by net revenue, with business in 13 countries including Spain, France and Britain. The transaction will give the new company, Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP), a value of 28 billion euros ($31 billion) including debt, a source involved in the deal said, adding that was based on the core earnings of the companies, planned synergies and CCE’s current valuation.  CCEP will have annual revenue of $12.6 billion and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $2.1 billion. “It’s a major milestone and major transaction that will benefit all parties involved,” said Coke Chief Executive Muhtar Kent on a conference call. “There’s no question we all believe that increased investment potential will lead to a better trajectory in terms of increased revenue growth going forward.”   CCE, whose drinks include Coke, Fanta and Capri-Sun, is struggling with weak sales in Western Europe, where austerity-hit consumers are drinking less soda, forcing producers to discount them, which hurts revenue and profit.  Combining the bottlers, which buy drink concentrate from Coca-Cola and package and distribute the drinks, will remove duplicate functions and free up cash to be reinvested in marketing and sales.  The formation of CCEP is the latest example of bottlers consolidating to face industry challenges. Coke and SABMiller  agreed in November to combine their soft drink businesses in Africa, while four Coke bottlers in Japan merged in 2013. The German and Spanish bottlers themselves are also the product of several bottlers merging.   “This is not something that just came out of a hat,” said CEO Kent. “It’s an evolution of what you’ve seen in other parts of the world.”  CCE shareholders will receive one share in the new company and a one-time payment of $14.50 a share. The cash portion, about $3.3 billion, will be funded via new debt issued by CCEP, the companies said. The deal is structured as a so-called tax inversion, with CCE moving corporate headquarters to London and cutting exposure to higher U.S. taxes. CCE, now based in Atlanta, used to be the biggest Coke bottler in North America, but sold its U.S. operations to Coke in 2010, leaving it operating solely in Europe.  CCE itself was spun off from Coca-Cola in 1986 as a way to boost Coke’s profit margins and balance sheet by separating the capital-intensive, low-margin bottling business into a different company.     CCE shareholders will own 48 percent of the new entity, with CCIP’s shareholders owning 34 percent. Coke will own 18 percent. Between the three parties there will be 17 board members, a factor causing concern about accountability for some investors, said Bernstein Research analysts. They also noted concerns about the “somewhat vague” cost-savings targets and the tax rate not being lower. The merger is expected to result in savings of $350 million to $375 million within three years of closing. “Net-net, we see synergies, look for clarity on cross-market accountability/cooperation and believe regulatory hurdles are limited,” Bernstein said.  CCEP will be incorporated in London and its shares will trade on Euronext Amsterdam, the New York Stock Exchange and the Madrid Stock Exchange.    While Coke’s CEO said the focus now was on executing the current deal, industry observers said there could be scope down the road for more consolidation. Europe’s other sizeable bottlers include Coca-Cola HBC (CCH.L) Coca-Cola Icecek (CCOLA.IS).   John Brock, current chief executive of CCE, will be CEO of the new group, while Sol Daurella, executive chairwoman of CCIP, will be chairwoman. Shares of CCE were up 2.8 percent in New York, where Coca-Cola shares were down 0.5 percent. News of the deal was reported last week by the Wall Street Journal, which sent CCE shares higher.  Rothschild acted as financial adviser to CCIP, while Deutsche Bank advised Coca-Cola. Lazard advised CCE, while Credit Suisse advised the franchise relationship committee of CCE’s board of directors.

689,KO,FIFA sponsor McDonald's backs independent reform body: group,"ZURICH (Reuters) - World Cup sponsor McDonald’s has joined Coca-Cola and Visa in urging FIFA to adopt an independent reform commission in response to the scandals that have plagued world soccer’s governing body. The campaign group New FIFA Now on Thursday published an email from a McDonald’s saying the fast food giant supports the creation of an independent body to deal with FIFA’s problems.     “In regards to an independent reform commission, we do believe this is an important step in the greater reform that has to happen within FIFA,” McDonald’s vice-president of global media relations and issues management, Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem wrote in the email.       Previously, McDonald’s had been critical of FIFA and urged change without specifically calling for an independent reform process.     “An independent commission would bring an appropriate level of credibility, transparency, and neutrality to the role, and ultimately provide sponsors and fans across the globe with the confidence that the reform effort is both meaningful and a step in the right direction,” wrote Sa Shekhem.     World soccer’s governing body has been in crisis since May, when nine officials and five marketing executives were charged by the U.S. Justice Department with exploiting the sport for their own gain through bribes of more than $150 million over 24 years.     In the wake of the scandal, FIFA President Sepp Blatter has said he will stand down next February.     Last month FIFA announced they were creating a Reform Task Force made up of ten representatives of its regional confederations and to be chaired by someone from outside of soccer.     That body, which has yet to have its membership announced, is scheduled to make its proposals to FIFA’s executive committee in late September.    Campaigners were critical of the move, saying only an entirely independent body could bring about effective change.      “We applaud McDonald’s for joining with Coca-Cola and Visa. They understand just how vital it is that reform of FIFA is independent of the deep vested interests surrounding the organization and its personnel,” said New FIFA Now co-founder Jaimie Fuller.

Carbonated beverages have suffered from slow growth in recent years as consumer sentiment shifts toward healthier beverages. Coca-Cola’s investment would value Suja, a start-up that counts Hollywood celebrities as investors, at around $300 million, the sources said.  The deal, which gives Coca-Cola the option to buy the remainder of Suja in three years, would strengthen the Atlanta-based company’s hold on the cold-pressed juice sector and better position it to compete against PepsiCo Inc’s PEP.N Naked Juice brands. It would be Coca-Cola’s second investment in the sector, following the purchase of Odwalla in 2001.  The sources asked not to be identified because the investment is not yet public. Representatives for Coca-Cola and Suja did not respond to requests for comment. Based in San Diego, Suja makes juices and smoothies under cold pressure to kill harmful bacteria and preserve nutrients and taste. It sells its drinks through SujaJuice.com, Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and at health food stores and national grocery chains. Suja was founded in 2012 by entrepreneurs Annie Lawless, Eric Ethans, Jeff Church and James Brennan. Its investors include Alliance Consumer Growth Partners and Evolution Media Partners, as well as actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Jared Leto and Sofia Vergara.  Coca-Cola created a venture and emerging brands division in 2007 to find and invest in growth opportunities. It has invested in firms such as Honest Tea and Zico Coconut Water.

697,KO,"Coca-Cola names Quincey president, fuelling succession speculation","(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) on Thursday named James Quincey president and chief operating officer, setting up the long-time company veteran to possibly one day take the helm of the world’s largest soda maker. The company also said Ahmet Bozer, another Coke veteran who had been widely seen as a possible successor to Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent, will retire. Bozer, executive vice president and president of Coca-Cola International, will stay on as an adviser until March of 2016, the company said. “We believe this structure will allow Kent to focus more on longer-term strategy across the entire Coke system versus day-to-day operations,” said Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog in a note.  “Given Quincey’s favorable regard in the organization and relatively young age, we believe this new role potentially positions him to become (Coke’s) next CEO.”  Quincey, 50, is a 19-year veteran of the company and most recently served as president of Coke’s Europe group, the company’s most profitable business.  The announcement means that Quincey could succeed Kent, 62, who was elected CEO in 2008. Under the new management structure, the heads of Coke’s international businesses, as well as Irial Finan, president of bottling investments, and Sandy Douglas, who oversees North America, will report to Quincey.  In a conference call with reporters, Kent declined to speculate on succession plans but said the board unanimously supported Quincey’s appointment.  Quincey was instrumental in leading the negotiations for the recently proposed merger of Coke’s bottlers Coca-Cola Enterprises CCE.N, Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and the German bottling business to form Coca-Cola European Partners Plc.  The proposed deal, valued at 28 billion euros ($31 billion), will make Coca-Cola European Partners the world’s largest independent Coca-Cola bottler based on net revenues. His team in Europe also helped Coke acquire juice maker Innocent in 2009.  “Given Quincey’s global background and significant deal experience, we can’t help but wonder if (Coke) will accelerate growth through stepped-up acquisitions,” Herzog said in the note. Before he joined Coke in 1996, Quincey was a partner in strategy consulting at the Kalchas Group, a spin-off from Bain & Company and McKinsey. He went on to serve in a number of roles at Coke in Latin America, including president of the Mexico division, where he oversaw the relaunch of Coca-Cola Zero and the acquisition of fruit juice maker Jugos de Valle.  The COO position had not been filled at Coke since Kent left the role in 2008. In 2012, the beverage giant announced a new operating structure, dividing its global business into three main units and giving then possible CEO successors Bozer and Steve Cahillane, who ran the North American bottling operations, much larger roles. Cahillane left in 2013 in another reorganization.

In a conference call with reporters, Kent declined to speculate on succession plans but said the board unanimously supported Quincey’s appointment. Quincey was instrumental in leading the negotiations for the recently proposed merger of Coke’s bottlers Coca-Cola Enterprises, Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and the German bottling business to form Coca-Cola European Partners Plc. The proposed deal, valued at 28 billion euros ($31 billion), will make Coca-Cola European Partners the world’s largest independent Coca-Cola bottler based on net revenues. His team in Europe also helped Coke acquire juice maker Innocent in 2009. “Given Quincey’s global background and significant deal experience, we can’t help but wonder if (Coke) will accelerate growth through stepped-up acquisitions,” Herzog said in the note. Before he joined Coke in 1996, Quincey was a partner in strategy consulting at the Kalchas Group, a spin-off from Bain & Company and McKinsey. He went on to serve in a number of roles at Coke in Latin America, including president of the Mexico division, where he oversaw the relaunch of Coca-Cola Zero and the acquisition of fruit juice maker Jugos de Valle. The COO position had not been filled at Coke since Kent left the role in 2008. In 2012, the beverage giant announced a new operating structure, dividing its global business into three main units and giving then possible CEO successors Bozer and Steve Cahillane, who ran the North American bottling operations, much larger roles. Cahillane left in 2013 in another reorganization. The company’s shares were little changed at $41.10 in afternoon trading.

699,KO,"CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Coca-Cola names Quincey COO, raising succession question","(Corrects spelling of Muhtar Kent in second paragraph) By Anjali Athavaley Aug 13 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co named James Quincey president and chief operating officer, a management shake-up that prompted questions of whether Quincey is now positioned to one day take the helm of the world’s largest soda maker. Quincey, 50, is a 19-year veteran of the company and most recently served as president of Coke’s Europe group. The COO role has not been filled since CEO Muhtar Kent left the role in 2008. Coke also said that company veteran Ahmet Bozer, who had been widely seen as a possible successor to Kent, will retire. Bozer, 55, executive vice president and president of Coca-Cola International, will stay on as an adviser until March, the company said on Thursday. The announcement means that Quincey could succeed Kent, 62, who was elected CEO in 2008. Under the new management structure, the heads of Coke’s international businesses, as well as Irial Finan, president of bottling investments, and Sandy Douglas, who oversees North America, will report to Quincey. “We believe this structure will allow Kent to focus more on longer-term strategy across the entire Coke system versus day-to-day operations,” said Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog in a note. “Given Quincey’s favorable regard in the organization and relatively young age, we believe this new role potentially positions him to become (Coke’s) next CEO.” In a conference call with reporters, Kent declined to speculate on succession plans but said the board unanimously supported Quincey’s appointment.

The meeting will take place in Zurich, the source told Reuters, although no further details were available. FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said last month that Coca-Cola, Visa and McDonald’s had written asking for information about what was being done to clean up governance of the sport and offering to meet soccer’s ruling body. Valcke’s announcement came after Coca-Cola and Visa urged FIFA to support the creation of an independent body to reform the way it is run. McDonald’s said it had told FIFA that its internal controls and compliance culture were not consistent with the expectations it had for its business partners. Coca-Cola confirmed in a statement that they would be involved. “The Coca-Cola Company will be participating in the working session with FIFA. We are not providing any further details at this time,” it said. FIFA was thrown into turmoil in May when U.S. prosecutors indicted nine soccer officials, most of whom had FIFA positions, and five marketing and broadcasting company executives over a range of alleged offences. The charges included fraud, money-laundering and racketeering. Visa and McDonald’s did not initially respond to requests for comment on the meeting.

Details of the investments were not disclosed. Reuters reported earlier this month that Coca-Cola was nearing a deal to acquire a minority stake in Suja, valuing the company at about $300 million. The deal illustrates Coca-Cola’s determination to get into fast-growing beverage categories amid sluggishness in its soft drinks business in recent years, especially in the U.S. market.

The bottlers, Coca-Cola Bottling Co Consolidated (COKE.O), Coca-Cola Bottling Company United and Swire Coca-Cola USA, will acquire the nine plants, valued at about $380 million, from Coca-Cola Refreshments, which Coke created after buying its top bottler in North America in 2010.  Additionally, Coke said all four entities, along with Coke’s operating group in North America, will form a new supply group to work together on decisions in areas such new packaging launches and ingredient purchases, Coke said.

Under a settlement made public late Wednesday and ending more than six years of litigation, Coca-Cola would add the words “with sweeteners” in two places on Vitaminwater bottles, and display calorie counts more prominently. It would also stop making some claims about the beverages, including the phrase “vitamins + water = all you need” and that drinking Vitaminwater may improve metabolic or immune functions or reduce the risk of eye disease. The settlement requires approval by a federal judge in Brooklyn, New York. Coca-Cola would begin making the changes within three months, and complete them within two years. The Atlanta-based company would also pay up to $2.73 million to cover fees and expenses of the plaintiffs’ lawyers. Food and beverage companies are often targeted in lawsuits claiming that their products are less healthy than advertised. PepsiCo Inc in 2013 agreed to stop calling its “Naked” juices “all natural” as part of a $9 million settlement. Vitaminwater is part of a beverage category sometimes called “enhanced water,” filling a gap between soft drinks and water. “We are pleased to reach an amicable resolution of these cases,” a Coca-Cola spokeswoman said. “Although we remain confident in our legal position, it simply made no sense to continue this costly legal battle.” The plaintiffs are represented by the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), and the law firms Scott + Scott LLP and Reese LLP. In court papers, the plaintiffs’ lawyers called the accord reasonable given the litigation risks, and said that even if Coca-Cola could settle for more “it is more important that a class receive some relief than possibly ‘yet more’ relief.” Maia Kats, director of litigation for the CSPI, said: “Injunctive relief is critical to protecting consumers moving forward, and our plaintiffs fully support that goal and end.” Vitaminwater comes in flavors such as acai-blueberry-pomegranate, dragonfruit and tropical citrus.

In court papers, the plaintiffs’ lawyers called the accord reasonable given the litigation risks, and said that even if Coca-Cola could settle for more “it is more important that a class receive some relief than possibly ‘yet more’ relief.” Maia Kats, director of litigation for the CSPI, said: “Injunctive relief is critical to protecting consumers moving forward, and our plaintiffs fully support that goal and end.” Vitaminwater comes in flavors such as acai-blueberry-pomegranate, dragonfruit and tropical citrus. A typical 20-ounce (591 ml) bottle contains 120 calories and 32 grams of sugar. The cases are Ackerman et al v. Coca-Cola Co et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 09-00395; and Ford v. Coca-Cola Co et al in the same court, No. 11-02355.

719,KO,"Exclusive: Pepsi, Coca-Cola competing for investment in Chobani","(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc PEP.N and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) are in talks to invest in Chobani LLC, in a deal that the Greek yogurt maker hopes could value it at as much $3 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. The negotiations illustrate how soft drink giants are making a push to diversify beyond the slow-growth carbonated beverage sector into the U.S. consumer market’s faster-growing healthy lifestyle segment. Chobani is exploring selling a minority stake, including warrants owned by private equity firm TPG Capital LP that account for between 10 percent and 20 percent of the yogurt maker’s equity depending on its financial performance, the people said. Chobani is looking for a strategic investor to help expand its supply chain, distribution, manufacturing base and geographic footprint for its popular yogurts like Flip, which combine yogurt with flavors such as peanut butter and coffee, the people added.  The deal under negotiation could change and there is no certainty that either Pepsi or Coca-Cola will reach an agreement, the people said. Other companies are also in talks with Chobani about a potential investment, the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Chobani, TPG and Cola-Cola declined to comment. Pepsi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Based in New Berlin, New York, Chobani was founded in 2005 by Turkish immigrant Hamdi Ulukaya, its majority owner and chief executive. While its yogurt has become one of the top-selling Greek brands in the United States, Chobani has also experienced some growing pains. Private equity firm TPG Capital LP gave a $750 million loan to the company last year to help it fund a turnaround. Pepsi and Coca-Cola are no strangers to the dairy sector. In 2012, Pepsi started selling yogurt through a joint venture with German dairy company Theo Müller. This year, Coca-Cola began national distribution of a milk product called FairLife, which it created through a joint venture with Select Milk Producers.  Pepsi, whose snack category includes “better for you” products such as Quaker Oats, as well as Frito-Lay chip and other offerings, has a broader snack portfolio than Coke.  Coca-Cola has a track record of minority investments in growth consumer segments, including stakes in coffee company Keurig Green Mountain Inc GMCR.O, energy drink Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O) and juice brand Suja Life LLC.

The soda maker, which gets more than half of its total revenue from markets outside North America, said a strong dollar would lower its full-year revenue by 7 percentage points compared with 6 percentage points estimated earlier.  The dollar has risen 12 percent against a basket of major currencies in the past year.  Coke has called 2015 a transition year as it tries to cut costs and boost sales by raising prices and diversifying into beverages beyond soft drinks such as cold-pressed juices and energy drinks.

The company said on Wednesday it signed letters of intent with three U.S. bottlers to expand distribution areas in seven states.

727,KO,Fitch Rates Coca-Cola's Issuance 'A+'; Outlook Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The  Coca-Cola Company's (Coca-Cola) multi-tranche issuance of senior notes  including: --$750 million senior fixed rate notes due 2017; --$1.5 billion senior fixed rate notes due 2020; --$1.75 billion senior fixed rate notes due 2025.  The Rating Outlook is Negative.  Coca-Cola had approximately $46.2 billion of debt as of Oct. 2, 2015. A complete  list of ratings follows at the end of this release. The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with the company's  senior unsecured obligations. Coca-Cola will use the net proceeds for general  corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures,  acquisitions of or investments in businesses or assets, redemption and repayment  of short-term or long-term borrowings and common stock purchases. KEY RATING DRIVERS Debt Structure, Elevated Leverage The Negative Outlook reflects Coca-Cola's elevated gross leverage of 3.4x on a  total debt-to-operating EBITDA basis for the first half of 2015, up from 2.8x at  the end of 2013. Since 2010, total debt has increased by approximately $21  billion to $46 billion at the end of the third quarter 2015. At July 2, 2015,  commercial paper balances totalled approximately $16 billion or 36% of the  firm's total debt. Coca-Cola does not generate sufficient domestic cash combined with dividend and  royalties from international sources to fund domestic cash requirements for the  dividend, U.S. capital investment, share repurchase program and strategic M&A;  activities. The company has also been reluctant to repatriate foreign earnings  given the tax consequences. As a result, the past growth in total debt including  Coca-Cola's large commercial paper balances, is due to domestic borrowing as a  large portion of the firm's cash flows are generated offshore. Sizeable Offshore Cash Position Coca-Cola maintains a sizeable offshore cash position due to the company's  substantial international cash generation. Of the $20.9 billion in cash,  short-term investments and marketable securities, $18.2 billion was held by  foreign subsidiaries excluding accounts held in Venezuela and Argentina as of  the second quarter 2015. For U.S. issuers, Fitch currently excludes foreign cash balances from its  definition of readily available cash used to calculate net leverage metrics.  Fitch recognizes that these cash balances are an asset that may be accessed and  used to reduce debt in the event it is necessary. For certain issuers with significant levels of foreign cash positions like  Coca-Cola, supplemental adjusted net leverage ratios are used when gauging the  level of tolerance/cushion within the assigned ratings. The foreign cash  balances are reduced by applying a generic 35% tax haircut and a further  adjustment capturing expectations for additional foreign cash balances that  could be used for shareholder-friendly actions. The supplemental adjusted EBITDA  net leverage for Coca-Cola at the end of the first half 2015 was 2.5x compared  to 2.0x at the end of 2013. Deleveraging Key to Outlook Stablization  Fitch had expected Coca-Cola's supplemental adjusted EBITDA net leverage to  increase to the mid 2x range driven by an estimated $4 billion of borrowing to  fund domestic requirements. Fitch views the increase in net leverage as  concerning since it has been due to Coca-Cola's aggressive financial policies. Continued progress by Coca-Cola toward developing and implementing an  appropriate longer-term plan during the next 12 months to reduce aggregate debt  balances including sustaining lower commercial paper (CP) balances that would  lead to an improved financial structure is key. Past CP levels were roughly half  of the total debt compared to 36% for the second quarter of 2015. If Fitch  believes the company cannot realize improvement within its credit profile that  is comparable to Fitch's 2016 expectations, a downgrade is likely. Strong Global Brands Coca-Cola ratings are supported by its position as the world's largest global  beverage company and the value of the Coca-Cola brand. Coca-Cola has 20 $1  billion plus brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute  Maid, Fanta Orange, Schweppes and Dasani. The strong brands, market position and  diversification lend considerable support to Coca-Cola's business profile. Given  the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's beverage  portfolio, the ratings consider the multiyear decline in CSD volumes in the  U.S., continued concern over artificial sweeteners affecting diet CSD demand in  North America, and modest CSD growth in other developed countries. However, this risk is mitigated by Coca-Cola's market strength in developing  geographies with greater long-term growth characteristics driven by low per  capita CSD consumption characteristics and expanding middle class that should  provide an important longer-term offset. CCEP Bottling Combination a Positive Fitch views the new bottling combination of Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP)  that will have pro forma 2015 revenue and EBITDA of $12.6 billion and $2.1  billion respectively, as a positive step toward improving the sustainability of  cash generation for the Coca-Cola System's underlying business operations in  Western Europe. As such, Coca-Cola's segment results should benefit longer-term  as its largest independent bottler improves its strategic operating profile. Coca-Cola's European bottling business has faced persistent headwinds caused by  a macro environment characterized by reduced consumer spending, higher  unemployment and the negative effects of austerity programs in Western Europe.  In addition, structural challenges due to health and wellness trends are  affecting the demand for carbonated soft drinks in developed markets. The  challenging environment thus places more importance on the need for Western  European consolidation. The merger increases operational scale, creates synergy opportunities, better  leverages best practices and improves operational strategy across 13 contiguous  countries. This should improve efficiencies, thus increasing CCEP's ability to  invest behind the brands. Fitch believes The Coca-Cola Company's 18% ownership  position, which includes two board seats, should also enhance the strategic  alignment within the Coca-Cola system between the two companies. The transaction  is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016. Innovation Pivotal Innovation and M&A; will continue to play pivotal roles for nonalcoholic beverage  companies including Coca-Cola to evolve their product portfolios beyond CSDs and  adapt to changing consumer taste or preferences. CSDs constitute approximately  74% of Coca-Cola's global portfolio. Diet CSD declines in the U.S. are in the  mid- to high single-digit range as perceptions toward artificial sweeteners,  fueled by social media attacks, remain highly negative. U.S. diet volume trends  are also inherently more volatile given the relatively narrow drinker base. As the shift in consumer attitude has become more centered on health and  wellness, companies are targeting new beverages that are fresh, natural,  minimally processed, and have a shorter ingredient list with flavorful taste  profile. Fitch believes innovation to bring back lapsed consumers to the CSD  category given the numerous alternative choices could prove challenging and  places a greater importance on having a well-rounded beverage portfolio. Regular  CSD retail trends should remain stable in North America in 2015, buoyed by  positive price/pack mix, innovation, marketing investments and an improving U.S.  economy. Operating Results For the quarter ended Oct. 2, 2015, revenue declined 5% to $11.4 billion and  operating income declined 12% to $2.4 billion on a reported basis. Organic  revenue growth, which excludes a 7% negative impact from currency, increased 3%  driven by 3% price/mix and modest growth in concentrate shipments. Organic  revenue growth was positive in all divisions except Asia Pacific which declined  1%. Currency neutral operating income increased 8% after adjusting for a 12%  foreign exchange headwind and other structural items. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Additional key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include: --Underlying organic sales growth of approximately 3.5% with volume growth of  1.5% and price/mix growth of almost 2% and an estimated foreign currency  headwind of approximately 7%; --Coca-Cola generates at least $10 billion of cash flow from operations (CFFO)  with approximately 50% of Coca-Cola's CFFO available for domestic use; --Coca-Cola continues to borrow debt to fund domestic cash requirements in 2015  such that total debt increases to $46 billion; --Net share repurchases of $2 billion for 2015; --Capital spending of $2.75 billion for 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  positive rating action include:  Fitch currently does not anticipate a positive rating action given Coca-Cola's  high financial leverage. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include:  A lack of meaningful progress toward developing and implementing an appropriate  longer-term plan during the next 12 months to reduce aggregate debt balances  including CP that would lead to an improved financial structure. Parameters of a  deleveraging plan could include the following:  --Meaningful debt reduction from 2015 debt levels of at least 10%. Longer-term  rating expectations are for Coca-Cola to maintain supplemental adjusted EBITDA  net leverage of approximately 2x or less; --Long-term gross leverage of approximately 3x or less; --An improved long-term alignment of domestic cash availability versus domestic  cash requirements such that Coca-Cola does not need to meaningfully increase  total debt on an annual basis to fund domestic cash needs;  --A less aggressive financial strategy related to dividend and share  repurchases; --Sustained reduction in commercial paper reliance.  If Coca-Cola successfully executes a deleveraging plan, Fitch could affirm the  ratings with a Stable Outlook.  Other factors that could individually or collectively, lead to negative rating  action include: --Large debt-financed acquisition; --Coca-Cola materially underperforms Fitch's expectations for organic growth  including volume and price/mix; --Further slowing growth in emerging and developing market regions; --Margin erosion from channel mix shifts, competition, increased spending that  result in reduced profitability; --Lack of progress with executing on productivity based initiatives. LIQUIDITY Strong Cash Generation, Liquidity Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to generate considerable CFFO  and free cash flow (FCF). For the second quarter ending 2015, Coca-Cola  generated $11.3 billion and $3.2 billion (adjusting for dividend payment) of  CFFO and FCF, respectively, after generating $10.6 billion and $2.9 billion for  the year ended Dec. 31, 2014. For 2015, Fitch expects CFFO of at least $10.5  billion. Coca-Cola's long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months totalled $2.7  billion. As of July 3, 2015, Coca-Cola's $29 billion liquidity position consisted of more  than $17 billion of cash and short-term investments, approximately $3.4 billion  of marketable securities, and $8.1 billion of availability under its committed  credit lines and revolving credit facility with rolling maturities through 2019. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Coca-Cola and its subsidiary as follows: The Coca-Cola Company --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Bank credit facilities 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'. Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (CCR) --Long-term IDR 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

728,KO,China environment bureau says Coca-Cola bottling plant falsified pollution data,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - An environmental protection bureau in northwest China said police temporarily detained an executive at a Coca-Cola Co bottling facility in Gansu province after it found the facility had falsified pollution data. In a report on its website, the Lanzhou city office of China’s Environmental Protection Bureau said authorities found Gansu COFCO Coca-Cola Beverage Co Ltd had tampered with data by altering the way it sampled and monitored its sewage output. The news was carried by local media outlets on Thursday. Police detained at least one of the facility’s executives for five days earlier this month as punishment, the Lanzhou environmental bureau’s statement said. Coca-Cola officials did not respond to repeated telephone calls and emails seeking comment. The Gansu facility, part of a joint venture between Chinese food processor COFCO Corp [CNCOF.UL] and Coca-Cola, said in a statement that it “attached great importance” to the matter and that an internal investigation had determined irregularities with monitoring equipment led to false data. The company would “rigorously strengthen internal oversight and put an end to the future occurrence of similar issues”, the statement said. Companies have been scurrying to boost their environmental credentials after China introduced tougher regulations this year to combat the country’s unwanted image of smog-choked cities, fouled waterways and heavy-metal tainted soil. China will ban water-polluting paper mills, oil refineries, pesticide producers and other industrial plants by the end of 2016, as it moves to tackle severe pollution of the water supply which has left one-third of China’s major river basins and 60 percent of its underground water contaminated.

730,KO,UPDATE 3-President says Indonesia intends to join TPP trade deal,"(Adds investment deals, paragraphs 6-7) WASHINGTON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo, speaking after a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday, said his Southeast Asian country intends to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal the United States has forged with 11 other nations. “We are the largest economy in Southeast Asia,” Widodo said through a translator. “And Indonesia intends to join the TPP.” U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said the United States would keep sharing information about the TPP, which will set common standards on issues ranging from workers’ rights to intellectual property protection. “As we have said from the beginning, TPP is intended to be an open platform to which other countries who are able and willing to meet the standards can potentially accede,” he said at a business summit hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. More broadly, Indonesia had work to do on cutting red tape, addressing barriers such as local content and local packaging requirements, eliminating import and export restrictions and protecting intellectual property rights, Froman said. President Widodo finalized more than $20 billion worth of U.S. deals during his trip, including a $500 million infrastructure investment from Coca-Cola and up to $1 billion from General Electric for Indonesia’s energy and healthcare sectors, according to the Indonesian embassy in Washington. Both deals were for a five-year period. Indonesia’s state oil firm Pertamina, and Corpus Christie Liquefaction, a subsidiary of Cheniere Energy, also finalized a shale gas deal valued at $13 billion. Widodo and Obama also discussed climate change, strengthening Indonesia’s maritime security powers and forest fires in Indonesia. The Indonesian government said earlier on Monday Widodo would be cutting short his trip to the United States in order to address the “haze crisis” caused by forest fires. Widodo linked the fires to the effects of climate change felt by Indonesia.

731,KO,UPDATE 2-Mexico's Coke Femsa 3rd-qtr profit slumps on volatile forex,"(Adds comments from conference call) MEXICO CITY, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Latin America’s largest Coke bottler, Coca-Cola Femsa, reported lower third-quarter profit on Wednesday, hurt by currency volatility and weak sales. Coke Femsa, which has been on a buying spree in recent years in an attempt to offset slowing Coke sales, is focusing on improving its operations and managing costs in its existing businesses, Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino said on a call with analysts. While Coke Femsa may still consider possible acquisitions in Latin America and elsewhere, the company is focused on increasing sales of existing products, particularly still beverages and juices “where we see lots of opportunities for growth,” he said. The bottling company said profit fell to 2 billion pesos ($118 million), from 3.5 billion pesos in the year-earlier quarter, and total revenue dropped 10 percent to 37.7 billion pesos. Still, the company’s success in hedging raw materials’ costs helped it increase its profit margin and investors appeared to react positively to that news, sending the share price up 1.9 percent to 126.63 pesos after the results statement. Coke Femsa has also been trying to raise prices where it can, at least in line with inflation, said Trevino. “We are trying to protect those margins,” he said. Sales of million-unit cases increased by only 1.1 percent, hurt by a dip in sales volume in Brazil, which is heading toward a prolonged recession. Coke Femsa has been trying to increase sales of bottled water and other non-carbonated beverages, to offset a dip in Coke sales in its main market since Mexico’s government introduced a fizzy-drinks tax. Coke Femsa’s parent company, Femsa, is due to report full results after the market close. Femsa operates the Oxxo convenience store chain and holds a 20 percent stake in Dutch brewer Heineken.

736,KO,UPDATE 2-Pricey beers lift SABMiller's quarterly underlying sales,"* Second-quarter revenue up 6 pct, volume up 2 pct * Currency depreciation curbed sales, profits * Says committed to performance, employees during takeover period   (Adds comments by CEO, analyst) By Martinne Geller LONDON, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Demand for higher-priced beers helped SABMiller to report a pick-up in quarterly underlying sales despite currency headwinds, a day after it formally received a $100-billion-plus takeover bid from industry leader Anheuser-Busch InBev. The maker of beers such as Peroni and Grolsch said on Thursday its performance accelerated in the second quarter, with underlying revenue rising 6 percent and beverage volume up 2 percent from the prior year. Fueled by strong gains in Africa and Latin America, and success in selling more higher-priced drinks including Castle Lite in South Africa and Cusquena in Peru, the results are an improvement from a 3 percent rise in revenue and flat volumes in the first quarter. Yet SABMiller is being hammered by the weakness of various operating currencies including the Colombian peso, Australian dollar and South African rand, which make raw materials like barley and aluminum more expensive for local units, and then reduces the value of those units’ revenues. “It’s a good business, but it’s under an awful lot of pressure,” Bernstein Research analyst Trevor Stirling said, adding that currencies were a major reason for a decline in the share price earlier this year. Its shares had fallen 18 percent in the four months to mid-September, when SABMiller revealed AB InBev’s approach. Many analysts say that decline had prompted AB InBev to finally launch a takeover offer that had been speculated about for years. On a reported basis, including the currency impact, revenue fell 12 percent to $10.0 billion and earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) fell 11 percent to $2.9 billion in the six months to Sept. 30. SABMiller said growth would continue to be driven by developing markets and its focus on more premium drinks, though foreign exchange and higher raw material costs would still weigh on results. It said it planned to deliver more than $430 million in annual savings by the end of its fiscal year, on 31 March 2016. That is ahead of its original target, for savings of $500 million by 2018. “The SABMiller board does believe that our strategy would have delivered further value to our shareholders over the long term. However, AB InBev’s offer secures that value today, which is why the board unanimously recommended it,” SABMiller Chief Executive Alan Clark said on a conference call. The takeover of the company, one of the largest in corporate history, is not expected to close until the second half of 2016, due to various antitrust approvals needed. In the meantime, SABMiller said it was committed to keeping employees motivated, despite what Clark described as a general tone of uncertainty among staff around future job security. He said the combination of its African soft drink bottling assets with those of Coca-Cola, a deal announced nearly a year ago, was on track to complete in coming months. He declined to say what would happen to the business after the takeover by AB InBev, which serves as a bottler for PepsiCo. He also told reporters it was too early to talk about SABMiller’s stakes in France’s Castel Group and Turkey’s Anadolu Efes or his own career intentions following the takeover.

737,KO,Varanasi villagers blame Coca-Cola for water scarcity,"NEW DELHI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Eighteen village councils in Uttar Pradesh are demanding a local Coca-Cola bottling plant be prohibited from extracting water from the ground, claiming its over usage has led to water scarcity in the area, said an environmental campaign group. The villages, which are located in Mehdiganj area of Varanasi district — the constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi —  claim they have been facing water shortages since 1999 when the plant began operations. “Elected village council heads represent the voice of the people, and they are clear that Coca-Cola is not welcome in Mehdiganj. It is time for Coca-Cola to pack up and leave,” said Amit Srivastava of the California-based India Resource Center, which is supporting the village councils. “Coca-Cola paints a pretty picture of itself internationally as a responsible user of water, but the reality in India is that it exploits groundwater at the expense of the poor, the women, children, farmers and livestock who have to live with less water because Coca-Cola mines groundwater in a water scarce area for profit.”   Mehdiganj is largely agrarian and communities here rely on groundwater to meet most of their needs, including for personal drinking and washing, irrigation and for livestock.   Coca-Cola uses the same groundwater source to meet its production needs — placing it in direct competition with the local community, environmentalists say. Srivastava said the 18 village councils had written to State Pollution Control Board, which granted a license to Coca-Cola, urging authorities to prohibit the company from extracting any more groundwater in the area. He also pointed to recent data released by the Central Ground Water Authority which declared Arajiline block, where the bottling plant in located, as “over exploited” in 2011. Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt ltd said a 2012 study by another authority called the Central Ground Water Board into a complaint by villagers of ponds, wells and hand pumps drying up found no evidence that the company was responsible. “The Central Ground Water Board observed that this depletion was not due to withdrawal of ground water by Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages Pvt. Ltd (HCCBPL) plant,” said a company statement emailed to the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “The report further mentioned there was a clear trend of water depletion in seven blocks of Varanasi district and particularly in Arajiline block, the rate was higher.” Despite the decline, the report also said there was enough water in ponds, dug-wells and good crops of wheat and mustard were observed in the fields, the statement added.

741,KO,Stumptown in a K-Cup? Keurig deal brings margin opportunity,"NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Taking coffee maker Keurig Green Mountain Inc private will give JAB Holding Co an opportunity to press for higher margins and even increase prices for the single-serve K-Cups used in about 21 million U.S. homes, analysts and industry bankers said. JAB said on Monday it would buy Keurig for $13.9 billion, its biggest acquisition in a quest to build a global coffee powerhouse to better compete with Switzerland’s Nestle SA . The announcement prompted comparisons on Wall Street between JAB’s strategy and that of brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev , though some industry watchers were sobered by the high price paid for Keurig, which is struggling with competition in single-serve pods and a failed product launch. While some of the more immediate benefits of a deal would come from JAB’s heightened leverage in sourcing coffee beans, the bigger opportunity lies in the greater profit of distributing JAB’s expanding portfolio of brands, including higher-end “craft” names like Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Caribou and Stumptown Coffee Roasters, analysts and bankers said. Some of those brands already produce K-Cups for Keurig machines under licensing agreements, but as company-owned brands those arrangements would provide higher margins. Overall, Keurig’s dominance of the U.S. single-serve market is a clear competitive advantage, said Jonathan Feeney, an analyst at Athlos Research. “They (JAB) can handle the brand strategy, the partner strategy, any way they want.” JAB could also raise prices on pods, especially since Keurig will be privately held and face far fewer requirements to disclose how it runs its business, Feeney said. As a result, partners who have licensing agreements with Keurig to make the pods, such as Starbucks Corp and Dunkin’ Brands Group , would not know how much Keurig is making from those deals and could find it harder to demand a greater cut. Whether Keurig will help JAB make greater inroads in Europe at the expense of Nestle remains a question, industry experts said, particularly in the single-serve market where Nestle serves espresso-style drinks rather than the American-style K-Cup which more closely resembles filter coffee. “I suspect they would need a modified machine,” said Robert Waldschmidt, a research analyst at investment bank Liberum. Others see room for more filter-style coffee in Europe. “Every meeting you go to, there is still a pot of coffee on the table that’s not espresso,” said one industry banker who was not involved in the deal. “There’s a lot of people drinking Americanos in Europe. There should be a market for this machine.” While significant risk exists that brands like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts could cut ties with Keurig once it is owned by JAB and opt for other partners to manufacture branded pods, analysts and bankers said it was unlikely. “These are significant streams of cash flow to these companies,” Feeney said. “It’s not trivial for them to say ‘OK we’ll just do this ourselves.’” Starbucks did not respond to a request for comment. Dunkin’ said in a statement that “we anticipate no change in how we work with Keurig.” JAB’s plan does not come cheap, as it will pay a 78 percent premium to Keurig’s closing share price as of Friday. “I do suspect they wanted to act quickly and in this instance certain key minority partners like (Coca-Cola Co ) are made whole,” Waldschmidt said. “This likely ensures that they get the deal done quickly with no competing bids.” ",12082015,http://www.reuters.com/article/keurig-ma-jab/stumptown-in-a-k-cup-keurig-deal-brings-margin-opportunity-idUSL1N13X2MI20151208

745,KO,UPDATE 2-Coca-Cola India says may have to shut factories if new sin tax passed,"(Adds Pepsi quote) By Tommy Wilkes NEW DELHI, Dec 11 (Reuters) - The Indian subsidiary of Coca-Cola Co said on Friday it may have to close some bottling plants if the government pushes through a proposal that would subject fizzy drinks to a 40 percent “sin” tax, as part of a broader fiscal overhaul. The beverage maker, which operates 57 factories and bottling plants across India, said a proposal to group sugary sodas with higher-taxed luxury cars and tobacco would hurt demand for its drinks. “It will lead to a sharp decline in consumer purchase,” Coca-Cola India said in a statement. “In these circumstances, we will have no option but to consider shutting down certain factories.” India’s ruling party is trying to push a national goods and services tax (GST) through parliament that would replace a myriad of state sales taxes and shake-up government revenue. A government-appointed panel examining GST has suggested a standard rate of 17 percent to 18 percent, and a higher tax of 40 percent on some goods including the carbonated drinks Coca-Cola sells. Several countries are debating so-called “sugar taxes” to tackle obesity and encourage healthier lifestyles. While more than a fifth of India’s population lives below the official poverty line, the country is home to the third-highest population of obese people after the United States and China, according to medical journal The Lancet. The chairman of Coca-Cola rival PepsiCo Inc in India, Shiv Shivakumar, said the company supported a unified tax in principle, and said he was confident the government would “take a balanced view of taxation with respect to our industry”.

746,KO,"South Africa's antitrust watchdog gives SABMiller, Coke deal preliminary approval","JOHANNESBURG, Dec 17 (Reuters) - SABMiller and Coca-Cola’s proposed deal to combine their operations that mix, bottle and distribute soft drinks in Africa, cleared a major hurdle on Thursday after South Africa’s competition watchdog gave its preliminary approval. SABMiller and Coca-Cola agreed in November 2014 to team up to create the continent’s largest soft drinks bottler, a group with annual sales of $2.9 billion and ambitions to corner a fast-growing market. The group, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, will account for 40 percent of all Coke volumes sold in Africa, serving 12 southern and eastern African countries. Coca-Cola Beverages Africa will be headquartered in South Africa, its largest market. South Africa’s Competition Commission said the deal can go ahead on several conditions that include the enlarged group limiting job cuts to 250 and making sure it purchases cans, glass, sugar and crates from local suppliers. The Commission investigates deals for any antitrust issues and recommends remedies to the Competition Tribunal, which makes a final ruling. There is no set timescale. The all-equity deal would also hand Coca-Cola an extra 20 brands, including sparkling soft drink Appletiser, whose fruit juice concentrate is sourced from South African producers. The Commission said the merged entity has agreed to continue sourcing fruit concentrate in South Africa to ensure that producers did not shut down or cut jobs.

748,KO,Coca-Cola blames ad agency for map showing Crimea as part of Russia,"MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - U.S. drinks firm Coca-Cola on Wednesday blamed a marketing agency for a map used in an online advertising campaign that showed Crimea to be part of Russia and which drew protests and threats of a boycott from angry Ukrainians. Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014, leading to condemnation from Western governments which imposed sanctions on Russia in response. Only a handful of countries have recognized Crimea’s incorporation into Russia. In a statement on Wednesday, Coca-Cola said: “We, as a company, don’t support any political movements. The company has removed the post and apologizes for the situation that occurred.” Coca-Cola said that the map, which appeared on Dec. 30 on Coca-Cola’s page on VKontakte, a Russian social networking site similar to Facebook, had been changed by an advertising agency without Coca-Cola’s approval. Furious Ukrainians took to social media to vent their anger against Coca-Cola, and some threatened to boycott the company’s products. Ukraine’s embassy in the United States said in a statement on its Facebook page that it had expressed concerns to the company and to the U.S. State Department.    “The Embassy emphasized that Coca-Cola’s actions violate the official U.S. position condemning Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea, which is and has always been an integral part of Ukraine,” the statement said. Coca-Cola is not the only multinational company to have inadvertently faced embarrassment recently because of the festering tensions between Russians and Ukrainians. Google said on Tuesday that problems experienced by some users in translating terms into Russian from Ukrainian using Google Translate were the result of errors in its automated algorithms, Russian agency RBC reported.

752,KO,New $130 million project aims to cut food waste from fields to tables,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - More than a third of the world’s food goes uneaten, and many crops harvested in Africa are discarded rather than sold, according to an initiative announced on Thursday by the Rockefeller Foundation to cut food waste and loss by half. The seven-year, $130 million project aims to tackle food waste from crops in the fields to dinner tables in industrialized nations, the Foundation said in its announcement at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Sub-Saharan Africa will receive much of the initiative’s resources, the Foundation said. In Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania, up to half of some crops are lost due to inefficient harvesting, storage, processing and time to market, it said. “The amount of food lost or wasted before it ever reaches a table is simply unacceptable, with devastating impacts on people, profit and planet,” said Judith Rodin, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, in a statement. Enough food is grown to feed the 1.2 billion hungry or undernourished people worldwide, but a third is never eaten, according to United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization figures cited by the Foundation. That lost food is worth about $1 trillion, according to the FAO. The initiative, called YieldWise, aims at cutting food waste and loss in half by 2030, the Foundation said. Last year, the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama also announced a goal of reducing food waste by 50 percent by 2030. In France, legislators have banned big supermarkets from destroying unsold but edible food.  The Foundation said it is counting on partnerships with food giants Coca-Cola Co and Dangote Group to help small farmers bring produce to market. Training at mango farms in Kenya, maize farms in Tanzania and tomato farms in Nigeria is already in the works, the New York-based philanthropic organization said, teaching farmers such skills as the use of crop-preserving technologies and strategies against crop loss.

The U.S. drinks giant bought the stake from unlisted TGI Group, the two companies said in a joint statement, but did not disclose the value of the sale.  Coca-Cola “intends to increase ownership within three years, subject to regulatory approvals while working on other long-term commercial structures”, the statement said. It already has a significant presence in Nigeria selling its fizzy drinks.  One industry source said Coca-Cola was paying a “triple-digit-million-dollar” amount for the stake. Sources told Reuters last year Chi was valued at as much as $1 billion. Lagos-based Chi Ltd, whose owners had been considering a sale for some time, produces mostly fruit drinks, iced teas, snacks and dairy products. TGI is owned by a European family, according to industry sources. “The parties have agreed to jointly discuss and explore other opportunities in the region to further develop this relationship,” the statement said, without elaborating. The investment comes as Nigeria faces one of its worst economic crises for decades as a slump in oil prices has eroded public finances, hammered its currency and hit consumer sentiment. In August 2014, Coca-Cola said it would invest $5 billion with African bottling partners in new manufacturing lines and equipment, as well as safe water access programs, over six years.

In the year since the last Super Bowl, shares of companies selling everyday consumer products like food and cleaning supplies have outperformed most other sectors, partly because they are seen as relatively safe bets in world of growing macroeconomic worries. But even that sector is vulnerable. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are set to report December-quarter results on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. Wall Street expects lower revenue and net income than a year ago for both, according to Thomson Reuters data. They and other U.S. multinationals, including Super Bowl advertisers Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD.N) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL.N), have been clipped by a strong dollar that is cutting into revenues in Latin America and Asia. They also face lackluster demand in the United States, where money saved from low gasoline prices has failed to fuel a long-awaited lift in spending at stores. Tepid economic growth has pushed companies to spend more on marketing in a bid to steal rivals’ customers. That increase is reflected in pricing for Super Bowl ads, up 76 percent over the past decade, according to market research firm Kantar Media. More than 100 million viewers in the United States and millions more around the world are expected to view Sunday’s Super Bowl in Santa Clara, California. Many familiar consumer brands are also struggling with the trend toward healthier foods and reduced loyalty to decades-old brands.  “Smaller niche brands are popular, they’re cooler among the millennials and the incumbents are challenged,” said Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj. Larger brands “have to get the consumer to think the brand is worth something and that’s why, in our opinion, they have to advertise more.” Coca-Cola and Pepsi are expanding their lineups of healthier drinks and snacks to appeal to changing tastes, while Anheuser-Busch is playing defense to growing numbers of small, local breweries catering to a thirst for premium, craft beers.

762,KO,"Cost cuts, cheaper commodities help Coca-Cola top profit estimates","(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported a better-than-expected profit in the last three months of 2015, helped by aggressive cost-cutting and lower commodity costs. The soda maker’s revenue fell 8 percent, but surpassed analysts’ average estimate, boosted by price hikes and the company’s bet on smaller can and bottle sizes. Coca-Cola’s shares rose about 1 percent to $43.02 in morning trading on Tuesday. The company, which is targeting $3 billion in annual savings by 2019, has been cutting costs through job reductions and selling some of its bottling operations and factories.  Coca-Cola said on Tuesday it would refranchise all its North America bottling operations by the end of 2017, three years earlier than expected, and also refranchise its bottling operations in China.   The refranchising would significantly reduce capital needs, while boosting margins and returns, the company said. Coca-Cola’s global sales volume rose 3 percent in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. “In the United States, in particular, we have a price-pack architecture strategy promoting the mini cans and the 8-ounce glass bottles,” Chief Financial Officer Kathy Waller told Reuters, adding that the strategy was doing well in the region. The company is expanding the smaller-package strategy globally, Chief Operating Officer James Quincey said on a media call.   Sales in China slowed in the quarter, the company said. China, together with Mexico, Brazil and Japan, accounted for nearly a third of the company’s 2014 global sales volume. Coca-Cola’s net operating revenue fell to $10 billion in the three months ended December, the third straight quarterly drop, largely due to a strong dollar, but beat analysts’ expectation $9.91 billion.  Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency, revenue declined 1 percent.

763,KO,"UPDATE 3-Cost cuts, cheaper commodities help Coca-Cola top profit estimates","(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported a better-than-expected profit in the last three months of 2015, helped by aggressive cost-cutting and lower commodity costs. The soda maker’s revenue fell 8 percent, but surpassed analysts’ average estimate, boosted by price hikes and the company’s bet on smaller can and bottle sizes. Coca-Cola’s shares rose about 1 percent to $43.02 in morning trading on Tuesday. The company, which is targeting $3 billion in annual savings by 2019, has been cutting costs through job reductions and selling some of its bottling operations and factories.  Coca-Cola said on Tuesday it would refranchise all its North America bottling operations by the end of 2017, three years earlier than expected, and also refranchise its bottling operations in China.   The refranchising would significantly reduce capital needs, while boosting margins and returns, the company said. Coca-Cola’s global sales volume rose 3 percent in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. “In the United States, in particular, we have a price-pack architecture strategy promoting the mini cans and the 8-ounce glass bottles,” Chief Financial Officer Kathy Waller told Reuters, adding that the strategy was doing well in the region. The company is expanding the smaller-package strategy globally, Chief Operating Officer James Quincey said on a media call.   Sales in China slowed in the quarter, the company said. China, together with Mexico, Brazil and Japan, accounted for nearly a third of the company’s 2014 global sales volume. Coca-Cola’s net operating revenue fell to $10 billion in the three months ended December, the third straight quarterly drop, largely due to a strong dollar, but beat analysts’ expectation $9.91 billion.  Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency, revenue declined 1 percent. However, net income attributable to shareholders jumped nearly 61 percent to $1.24 billion, or 28 cents per share.  Selling, general and administrative expenses fell 9.2 percent to $3.94 billion.

767,KO,Coca-Cola hopes to refresh corporate Kangaroo market,"SYDNEY, Feb 16 (IFR) - The Coca-Cola Company  (Aa3/AA/A+) looks set to provide the first real test of the year for the corporate Kangaroo market, having mandated Deutsche Bank to arrange investor meetings from March 7 for a potential debut trade. The stellar A$2.25 billion ($1.59 billion) triple-tranche issue last August from Apple, rated Aa1/AA+ (Moody’s/S&P;), raised hopes that Australia would become a key second-tier destination for overseas credits, alongside the sterling, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar markets. Intel, rated A1/A+ (Moody’s/S&P;), followed three months later with a slightly underwhelming inaugural A$800 million dual-tranche sale, which, despite being the second-largest corporate Kangaroo, failed to match hopes for a A$1 billion-plus issue. Intel’s average order sizes were back at the typical A$20 million-A$50 million levels rather than the bumper Apple tickets of up to A$150 million, as the world’s biggest chip-maker struggled amid a more difficult market backdrop than the one Apple had faced. Limited credit analyst coverage among Australian fund managers also weighed on the Intel trade, while several Asian investors felt the pick-up offered over Intel’s US dollar curve was insufficient to compensate for the lower liquidity in the Australian market. The latter is a particularly important consideration during times of global market stress. Local funds are more familiar with Coca Cola, especially with regional bottler Coca-Cola Amatil, rated A3/A- (Moody’s/S&P;), having previously issued Australian dollar bonds, including a A$150 million seven-year MTN in November 2012. With the Aussie dollar, a proxy for China risk, now trading at around 70 US cents after being near parity between October 2010 and October 2014, a Kangaroo issue must now exceed A$700 million to reach the equivalent US dollar benchmark size of $500 million. It will be a very impressive result if Coca-Cola matches the size of its first Matterhorn transaction in September 2015, a SFr1.325 billion ($1.345 billion) three-trancher. Coca-Cola debuted in the euro market 12 months earlier with a 2 billion euro ($2.23 billion) dual-trancher and followed up with a whopping 8.5 billion euro five-note issue last February. The company, historically a large issuer, printed its last US dollar transaction in October 2015 with a $4 billion SEC-registered three-part senior unsecured offering. Deutsche Bank’s role as arranger for the Coca-Cola roadshow underlines its position as the go-to international bank for US corporate blue chips looking to visit Down Under. Deutsche was joint lead manager for the Apple Kangaroo with CBA and Goldman Sachs and also led the Intel debut alongside Westpac. Although the Korea National Oil Corporation A$325 million three-year floating-rate-note sale on February 2 was technically 2016’s first corporate Kangaroo, the state-owned company is seen as sovereign rather than corporate risk, while only 2 percent of the bonds were allocated to Australasian investors.

770,KO,UPDATE 2-Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway quarterly profit jumps almost one third,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc on Saturday said fourth-quarter profit rose 32 percent, helped by improved results in its insurance operations and higher gains from investments and derivatives. Net income rose to $5.48 billion, or $3,333 per Class A share, from $4.16 billion, or $2,529 per share, a year earlier. Quarterly operating profit rose 18 percent to $4.67 billion, or $2,843 per share, from $3.96 billion, or $2,412 per share. Analysts on average had forecast operating profit of $2,814 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 7 percent to $51.82 billion. Book value per share, which reflects assets minus liabilities and which Buffett considers a good yardstick for Berkshire’s intrinsic worth, rose 3 percent from the end of September, to $155,501. For all of 2015, profit rose 21 percent to $24.08 billion, or $14,656 per share. The gain from the merger that created Kraft Heinz Co prevented profit from edging lower, Berkshire said. Operating profit rose 5 percent to $17.36 billion, or $10,564 per share. Buffett, 85, has run Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire for nearly 51 years. He has transformed it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with roughly 90 businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food, apparel and real estate. Buffett’s largest-ever acquisition, the $32 billion purchase of industrial parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, closed last month. It ended the year with $71.73 billion of cash. Berkshire expects on Monday to close its acquisition of Procter & Gamble Co’s Duracell battery business, in exchange for P&G; shares that Berkshire now owns. Quarterly profit from insurance operations rose 25 percent to $1.34 billion, as improvement in reinsurance offset higher claims payouts in the Geico auto insurance unit.  Berkshire said gains from investments and derivatives quadrupled to $805 million. This in part reflected profits on stock sales and gains on long-term options contracts whose value is tied to the performance of the stock market. Profit at the BNSF railroad unit fell 9 percent to $1.08 billion, reflecting lower demand, especially in coal and some industrial products, as oil prices fell.  Buffett said BNSF’s profit could decline further in 2016. Berkshire’s insurance units ended 2015 with $87.7 billion of float, the amount of premiums held before claims are paid, Buffett said. Berkshire uses float to help fund acquisitions and other investments. The company has well over $100 billion of equity investments. Berkshire said it plans to keep its big stake in IBM Corp despite a $2.6 billion paper loss as of Dec. 31. In Friday trading, Berkshire’s Class A shares closed at $198,190.50, and its Class B shares closed at $131.92. Both are nearly unchanged this year.

776,KO,CORRECTED-UK sugary drink tax could be sweet for food ingredient suppliers,"LONDON (Reuters) - The British government’s planned levy on sugary soft drinks means more business for suppliers of specialty ingredients that boost sweetness without adding calories and can mask aftertastes or add texture.  The surprise levy announced on Wednesday would go into effect in two years. That gives manufacturers including Coca-Cola (KO.N) or PepsiCo PEP.N and their UK partners such as Coca-Cola Enterprises CCE.N or Britvic (BVIC.L) time to roll out more low-calorie drinks.  Beneficiaries could include PureCircle (PURE.L), which sells the natural low-calorie sweetener stevia, Tate & Lyle (TATE.L), which sells sweeteners such as sucralose, and Kerry Group (KYGa.I), which sells natural flavours and coloring agents. Such companies are profiting from growing demand for lower-calorie foods and are free of competition from independent start-ups or own-brand players, since they often supply all major manufacturers.  They are also high-margin, high-growth and have high barriers to entry, said Neil Brown, investment manager of pan European equities on Alliance Trust’s Sustainable Investment team. His fund has owned shares of Kerry and peers Chr. Hansen (CHRH.CO), Naturex (NATU.PA) and DSM (DSMN.AS) for years. “Obesity is a serious issue, and most of us are trying to eat more healthily,” Brown said. “We’d rather be in the company that gets the phone call to try and fix it, rather than the company that faces clear headwinds.”  U.S. firm Ingredion (INGR.N), which sells corn syrup and other ingredients, has seen “double-digit” growth in its specialty ingredients business in Mexico since that country implemented a tax on sugary drinks and foods in 2014. “It created an environment for a company like ours to come up with affordable, healthy solutions,” CEO Ilene Gordon told Reuters recently.  “We quickly took formulations that we had in the rest of the world, solutions from Europe, and we adjusted them for the Mexican market, in flavor, taste and affordability,” she said, citing as an example a Mexican yogurt that Ingredion reformulated using a less expensive starch.  For Investec analyst Nicola Mallard, the two-year window before implementation of the UK levy is a sign the government  wants manufacturers to reformulate drinks, rather than merely raise prices, which can have limited effect if people get used to the new price and eventually return to old habits. “The easiest way to get people to consume less sugar is to not put it in the product in the first place,” Mallard said. Yet Coke, Pepsi and others have been changing their product line-ups for the past decade, adding more lower-calorie juices, teas and water drinks as well as low-calorie versions of their flagship colas, to match consumer demand. “If you go back 20 years, the proportion of low- or no-calorie products on the market was 30 percent,” said Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association. “Now it’s about 60 percent,” including bottled water. In January, for example, Coke announced a “one brand” approach to marketing its flagship cola that allows for the classic full-calorie version in red packages, but also Diet Coke in silver, Coke Zero in black and most recently, Coke Life in green.  The variety means Coke never has to change the recipe of the classic cola, said Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt, though it has changed the recipe for Coke Life in the UK.  Instead of one-third less sugar as it had for its 2014 launch, the new mid-calorie Coke Life has 45 percent less, due to the addition of more stevia, which comes from a South American shrub.  “Reformulation is biggest on new products because there’s no preset notion of what it should taste like,” Waldschmidt said.  Brands are reluctant to change recipes too fast, he said, citing last year’s rocky performance for Diet Pepsi in the United States after it replaced aspartame with sucralose.  Consumers complained of an unpleasant aftertaste in the new version, which highlights the opportunity for a class of specialty ingredients that do not provide sweetness or flavor, but have functional benefits like masking an aftertaste, boosting a sweetness, or providing bulk or texture. There will also be growing demand for ingredients such as Tate & Lyle’s Dolcia Prima, made from allulose, which has 70 percent of the sweetening power of sugar but only 10 percent of the calories.  Allulose, which occurs naturally in figs, raisins and jackfruit, can be used in the United States, but has not yet been approved in Britain.

777,KO,Fitch Affirms Coca-Cola's IDRs at 'A+/F1'; Outlook Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings  (IDRs) and the debt ratings of The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its  subsidiaries at 'A+/F1'. The Rating Outlook is Negative. A full list of rating  actions follows at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The Negative Outlook reflects Coca-Cola's elevated leverage (on both a gross  leverage and supplemental net leverage basis) as currently high for the ratings.  Moreover, Fitch needs to see progress related to refranchising and evidence that  Coca-Cola will adhere to a more balanced capital allocation stragegy related to  share repurchases, dividends and debt reduction. The Outlook could be stabilized  with a public commitment over the next 12 months toward a deleveraging policy.  Fitch would need to see clear visibility and traction on gross leverage  declining below 3x and supplemental net leverage below 2x as the company  transitions to a franchising model, produces at least 3% organic top-line growth  and sees EBITDA improvement through targeted productivity initiatives.  Long-term Business Model Strengthened Fitch believes Coca-Cola's long-term business model will strengthen as a result  of accelerated refranchising plans. While refranchising will cause some  near-term EBITDA dilution, Coca-Cola will receive upfront cash proceeds that  will be used for debt reduction and an annuity stream related to bottling assets  to offset this decline. Moreover, over time, the refranchising will  substantially reduce SG&A; costs, increase gross margins to the upper 60% range,  result in operating margins that improve to the mid-30% range from approximately  24%, and significantly reduce capex intensity. Consequently, upon completion of  refranchising in 2017, Coca-Cola's underlying cash flows are expected to be more  stable providing greater support to its longer-term credit profile.  Coca-Cola's $3 billion productivity program to be completed by 2019 also  provides additional benefits to operating profit and cash generation. While  Coca-Cola is using a portion of these savings to support brand strength by  increasing media and R&D; spending, cost reductions should help drive future  growth in operating profit. Consequently, Fitch views Coca-Cola's long-term  mid-single-digit revenue and high-single-digit profit before tax financial  targets as achievable. More Balanced Capital Allocation Expected Coca-Cola generates substantial overseas cash flows due to its position as the  world's largest non-alcoholic beverage company and has been reluctant to  repatriate foreign earnings given the tax consequences. Accordingly, foreign  cash balances have grown along with debt including larger commercial paper (CP)  balances to fund domestic cash requirements for the dividend, U.S. capital  investment, share repurchase program and strategic M&A; activities.  Coca-Cola is in the process of implementing a more appropriate longer-term  capital allocation policy to improve the alignment of domestic cash generation  versus domestic cash requirements that should benefit its longer-term financial  structure. These steps include: a reduced reliance on CP usage to below $15  billion, a more balanced long-term share repurchase policy including reductions  for material M&A; activity, a more conservative pace of dividend growth, and  using a portion of refranchising proceeds for debt reduction.  CP balances have declined to $13 billion at the end of 2015 from approximately  $19 billion a year ago as Coca-Cola committed to reduce its reliance on this  funding source, although overall debt increased by $2.2 billion in 2015. CP as a  percent of total debt was approximately 30% for 2015 which compares to peak  usage of approximately 50% of total debt. Fitch expects Coca-Cola will maintain  CP balances below $15 billion over the long term which compares to a past soft  cap of $20 billion. Supplemental Net Leverage Expected to Decline For U.S. issuers, Fitch currently excludes foreign cash balances from its  definition of readily available cash used to calculate net leverage metrics.  Fitch recognizes that these cash balances are an asset that may be accessed and  used to reduce debt in the event it is necessary. Therefore, for certain issuers  with significant levels of foreign cash positions, like Coca-Cola, supplemental  adjusted net leverage ratios are used when gauging the level of  tolerance/cushion within the assigned ratings. Foreign cash balances are reduced  by applying a generic 35% tax haircut and a further adjustment capturing  expectations for additional foreign cash balances that could be used for  shareholder-friendly actions. In our calculations, Fitch haircuts after-tax  foreign cash balances by 25% to accommodate for share buybacks.  Fitch expects long-term gross debt, inclusive of CP, to decline during the next  several years with a more balanced capital allocation policy. Supplemental  adjusted EBITDA net leverage for Coca-Cola at the end of 2015 was approximately  2.6x compared to 2.3x at the end of 2014. After a modest increase in 2016, Fitch  expects supplemental net leverage will decrease to around 2x in 2018/2019 due to  debt reduction and EBITDA growth.  Strong Global Brands  As the world's largest global beverage company, Coca-Cola ratings are supported  by it strong market shares, extensive geographic diversity, strong distribution  platform and valuable brand equity. Coca-Cola has more than 20 $1 billion-plus  brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute Maid, Fanta  Orange, Schweppes and Dasani. The strong brands, geographic reach, market  position and diversification afford considerable support to Coca-Cola's business  profile that has led to stable, sustainable cash flows. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's beverage  portfolio and constituting approximately 73% of the mix, the ratings consider  the multiyear declines in CSD volumes in the U.S., continued concern over  artificial sweeteners affecting diet CSD demand in North America, risks  associated with excise tax increases and slowing growth in other developing  countries. Fitch believes this risk is mitigated in part by Coca-Cola's market  strength in developing and emerging geographies with greater long-term growth  characteristics driven by low per-capita CSD consumption characteristics,  urbanization, population growth, and expanding middle class that should provide  an important longer-term offset.  Coca-Cola along with the rest of the beverage industry have also modified their  price/mix strategy, primarily in developed markets, to focus on both smaller  pack size and premium/alternative packaging to drive a higher price per unit  versus its past volume focus. Consumers are increasingly seeking premium and  smaller-sized offerings as evidenced by the low-double-digit growth rates within  this packaging combination mix. Underlying Growth Should Improve Fitch expects underlying revenue growth in 2016 of approximately 3.6% with  volume growth of 1.8%, price/mix growth of 1.8% and foreign currency pressure of  4%. Beyond 2016, Fitch believes Coca-Cola should be able to improve organic  growth rates during the medium term to close to 5% on volume growth of 3% and  product/mix of 2%. Fitch expects underlying operating income growth will  increase in 2016 by almost 7% driven by productivity benefits and organic  growth. Coca-Cola's productivity savings program enables additional financial  flexibility over the next several years to cover incremental investments and  costs that will be used in part for increased media investments and brand  support development. Coca-Cola has already redirected $600 million in previous  productivity savings toward increased media spending and expects to increase  spending by up to $200 million-$400 million more during the next two years. CCR Ratings:  Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola  Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations, since default risk is very low  at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to the  notes issued by Coca-Cola. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our 2016 rating case for Coca-Cola include: -- Underlying revenue growth of approximately 3.6% with volume growth  approximately 1.8%, price/mix growth of approximately 1.8% and foreign currency  pressure of 4% in 2016; -- Underlying operating income growth is estimated to increase by almost 7%; -- Coca-Cola generates approximately $10 billion of cash flow from operations  (CFFO) with more than 50% of Coca-Cola's CFFO available for domestic use. Free  cash flow (FCF) in excess of $1.5 billion in 2016; -- Total debt increases marginally as borrowings to fund domestic cash  requirements are expected to moderate; -- Net share repurchases of $2.25 billion; -- Capital spending of $2.5 billion; -- Gross leverage of 3.7x and net supplemental leverage of 2.7x. Over the forecast period through 2019 and once refranchising is complete,  assumptions include: --Gross margin increasing to the high 60% range; --Operating margins increasing to the mid 30% range; --Gross debt levels declining from a current level of $44.2 billion through  proceeds from asset sales combined with a more balanced capital allocation  policy; --Gross leverage of 3x times and net supplemental leverage reducing to less than  2x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  stabilization of the rating outlook include:  --A public commitment toward a deleveraging policy over the next 12 months. This  commitment would be reflective of achieving a more balanced capital allocation  policy with a pullback in share repurchases and a commitment to reduce gross  debt levels. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include:  --A lack of deleveraging such that gross leverage is sustained above 3x and  supplemental adjusted EBITDA net leverage is sustained above 2x over the  long-term; --A lack of public commitment to debt reduction; --A lack of execution with refranchising plans; --Productivity program does not fully deliver expected cost benefits;  --A more aggressive financial strategy related to dividend, M&A; and share  repurchases. LIQUIDITY Strong Cash Generation, Sizeable Offshore Cash Position Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to generate considerable CFFO  and (FCF). For 2015, Coca-Cola generated $10.5 billion and $2.2 billion  (adjusting for dividend payment) of CFFO and FCF, respectively, modestly ahead  of Fitch's expectations of $10.3 billion and $1.8 billion. As of Dec. 31, 2015,  Coca-Cola's approximate $28 billion liquidity position consisted of $19.9  billion of cash, short-term investments and marketable securities, and $8.3  billion of availability under its committed credit lines and revolving credit  facility with rolling maturities through 2019. Coca-Cola's long-term debt  maturing in the next 12 months totals $2.7 billion. Coca-Cola maintains a sizeable offshore cash position due to the company's  substantial international cash generation. Of the $19.9 billion in cash,  short-term investments and marketable securities, the majority was held by  foreign subsidiaries. Foreign cash balances will increase during the first  quarter of 2016, when Coca-Cola receives $2.4 billion for its ownership interest  in Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. following its acquisition by JAB Holding Company.

778,KO,"Weak Europe demand, strong dollar take fizz out of Coke's sales","(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co’s sales fell for the fourth straight quarter as demand weakened for its fizzy drinks in Europe and a strong dollar ate into revenue from other markets outside the United States, including Latin America. Shares of the world’s largest beverage maker, which maintained its revenue and earnings growth forecasts for 2016, fell as much as 5.5 percent to $44.06 on Wednesday.  Coke and smaller rival PepsiCo Inc have been hurt as consumers increasingly turn health-conscious, cutting back on fizzy drinks and opting for teas, fruit juices and smoothies. The rise in the dollar has also hit the companies, which have a sizeable presence in markets outside the United States, including China and Brazil.  The average value of the dollar rose 2.6 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.  Coke’s sales in Europe, its third biggest market, declined 1 percent in the quarter ended April 1, while Latin America sales plunged 12.2 percent.  Sales in Asia Pacific, including China, dropped 4 percent, but volumes increased as the company sold more lower-margin products. In Asia, pricing is expected to be a “little volatile and bumpy” in the coming quarters, Chief Operating Officer James Quincey said on a post-earnings conference call.  He said the impact of the “challenging” macro environment in China on the industry was worse than expected and demand in Brazil had suffered due to macroeconomic headwinds.  Coke is banking on new marketing initiatives, such as the “One Brand” program rolled out on Wednesday, to boost sales.  All cans and bottles of its Coca-Cola branded sodas will have a similar appearance, prominently featuring the red color associated with regular Coke, but sporting a band of the color that distinguishes Diet Coke, Coke Zero and Coke Life.    The company has also introduced smaller packs, which typically bring higher margins.  Coke’s net operating revenue fell 4 percent to $10.28 billion. However, total organic revenue, which excludes the impact of currency movements, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 2 percent.  The net income attributable to shareholders fell 4.5 percent to $1.48 billion, or 34 cents per share. Excluding items, Coke earned 45 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate by a cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Coke maintained its 2016 forecast of 4-5 percent growth in organic revenue and 4-6 percent growth in earnings per share on a constant-currency basis.

779,KO,US STOCKS-Wall St flirts with record high levels as companies report,"(Reuters) - Wall Street ended less than 2 percent short of a record-high close on Wednesday as a rebound in oil prices added to optimism sparked by a raft of earnings reports. Driven 15 percent higher since mid-February by a recovery in weak oil prices and helped by a softer dollar, the S&P; 500 stood less than 30 points below last May’s all-time peak. Investors fixated on a parade of first-quarter results, including an upbeat report from VMWare and a disappointing scorecard from Coca-Cola.  Weighed down by the energy sector, first-quarter earnings at S&P; 500 companies are expected to have slumped 7.5 percent on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Due to the market’s recent oil-fueled gains and the tempered outlook for corporate profits, the S&P; 500 is trading at about 17.8 times expected earnings, its most expensive level since 2004, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. Crude on Wednesday gained about 2 percent after a report showed U.S. inventories grew less than expected last week. “It would be overly optimistic to assume it’s clear sailing from here,” said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta. “The good news has to keep on coming for this market to keep moving higher.”  Data on Wednesday showed U.S. home resales rose more than expected in March, pointing to a continued recovery in the housing market, despite signs of sluggish first-quarter economic growth. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.24 percent to end at 18,096.27 points and the S&P; 500 gained 0.08 percent to 2,102.4. The S&P; earlier traded as high as 2,111 points. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.16 percent to 4,948.13. Five of the 10 major S&P; sectors rose, led by an 0.89 percent rise in financials and an 0.8 percent increase in energy.  After the bell, Qualcomm reported a 19.5 percent drop in quarterly revenue and its stock lost 0.5 percent. During the session, better-than-expected quarterly profits pushed several stocks higher, with VMWare jumping 13.74 percent, Discover Financial Services rallying 8.16 percent, St. Jude Medical gaining 3.99 percent and Yahoo rising 4.16 percent. Coca-Cola fell 4.78 percent after sales dropped for the fourth straight quarter. Lexmark jumped 9.38 percent after it agreed to be taken private by a group of investors led by China-based Apex Technology Co and PAG Asia Capital in a deal valued at $3.6 billion net of cash.

Crude reversed course sharply and gained about 2 percent after a report showed U.S. inventories grew less than expected last week. A three-day strike by Kuwaiti workers had driven prices higher and helped the S&P; 500 breach 2,100 on Tuesday, about 30 points shy of its record high. Investors are focused on the earnings season as they seek catalysts that will drive stocks. Big-bank earnings reports last week were better than expected and helped lift sentiment, even though expectations for profit growth this quarter are bleak. First-quarter earnings at S&P; 500 companies are expected to have fallen 7.5 percent on average and revenues are seen dipping 1.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The momentum is still skewed to the positive despite the earnings data and some of the mixed economic data,” said Anthony Valeri, an investment strategist for LPL Financial in San Diego. Valeri said the improvement in China and continued stability in the price of oil were also adding to the positive sentiment. Data on Wednesday showed U.S. home resales rose more than expected in March, pointing to a continued recovery in the housing market, despite signs of sluggish first-quarter economic growth. At 12:39 p.m. ET (1640 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 65.98 points, or 0.37 percent, at 18,119.58. The S&P; 500 was up 5.06 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,105.86.

Crude fell about 2 percent after Kuwaiti oil workers called off a strike that drove up prices and helped the S&P; 500 breach 2,100 on Tuesday, about 30 points shy of its record high. A recent rebound in oil and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy helped the index recover from a steep selloff earlier this year. Investors are focused on the earnings season as they seek catalysts to drive stocks higher. Big-bank earnings reports last week were better than expected and helped lift sentiment. “If earnings continue to surprise on the upside, you could see people ... join the rally and that money from the sidelines will move into the market,” said Nadia Lovell, U.S. Equity Specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Lovell expects the market to edge up on Wednesday, but cautioned that investors remained wary. First-quarter earnings at S&P; 500 companies are expected to have fallen 7.6 percent on average and revenues are seen dipping 1.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 9:40 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.45 points, or 0 percent, at 18,054.05, the S&P; 500  was down 1.17 points, or 0.06 percent, at 2,099.63 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 8.70 points, or 0.18 percent, at 4,931.63. Six of the 10 major S&P; sectors were higher. Healthcare  rose 0.35 percent, while consumer staples  fell 0.69 percent, dragged down by Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola fell 4.5 percent to $44.50 after the company’s quarterly sales dropped 4 percent. The stock was the second biggest drag on the Dow. Intuitive Surgical’S 3.9 percent rise to $648 propped up the healthcare sector. The company’s better-than-expected quarterly profit prompted brokerages to raise their price targets on the stock. Better-than-expected quarterly profits pushed VMWare  up 14 percent, Discover Financial Services 5.7 percent, Yahoo 2.5 percent and EMC up 2.8 percent. Lexmark jumped 10.1 percent to $38.16 after it agreed to be taken private by a group of investors led by China-based Apex Technology Co and PAG Asia Capital in a deal valued at $3.6 billion net of cash.

793,KO,"SABMiller, Coke agree concessions with South Africa over bottling deal","JOHANNESBURG/LONDON (Reuters) - SABMiller SAB.L and Coca-Cola (KO.N) have agreed concessions with the South African government to win approval for their plan to merge African soft drink operations into what would be the continent’s biggest Coke drinks bottler. The concessions, announced on Wednesday, agreed with the South African Ministry of Economic Development, include a three-year freeze on layoffs and the companies investing 800 million rand ($54 million) to support small South African businesses. Brewer SABMiller, in the process of the being taken over by Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), agreed in November 2014 to team up with Coke and the South African owners of local bottler Coca-Cola Sabco to create Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which would have annual sales of $2.9 billion and operations in 12 markets across Southern and East Africa. Upon completion of the all-equity deal, Coke will own 11.3 percent of the venture, the Gutsche family that owns Coke Sabco 31.7 percent and SABMiller 57 percent.  Sources familiar with the situation said there is a change-of-control clause that would allow Coke to buy SAB’s stake following SAB’s takeover by AB InBev, expected in the second half of this year. Coke’s ambitions are unknown, but some industry sources said a continuation of the current arrangement was unlikely. They point to AB InBev’s status as a PepsiCo PEP.N bottler in Latin America and the fact that it does not have a history of keeping stakes and joint ventures like SAB.  Coke has been moving away from outright ownership of bottling assets, which are more capital intensive and lower-margin than selling syrup and marketing, meaning there could also be an opportunity for other bottlers, such as Coca-Cola HBC (CCH.L) or Coca-Cola Femsa (KOFL.MX), to expand. Coca-Cola declined to comment on the terms of its agreements or plans for the stake, which one source said could be worth as much as $3 billion.  Last week, during AB InBev’s annual meeting, company executives declined to detail their plan for Coke in Africa. The bottling deal was given a preliminary approval in December by South Africa’s Competition Commission, which said it could go ahead on several conditions including limiting jobs cuts to 250 and making sure it buys cans, glass, sugar and crates from local suppliers. The Commission investigates deals for any antitrust issues and recommends remedies to the Competition Tribunal, which makes a final ruling. A Tribunal hearing on the proposed deal, which would be a last hurdle, is due to start on May 9. South Africa has a history of taking its time over approving deals, partly because regulators have a public interest mandate to safeguard jobs in addition to ensuring there is competition.  “I am very happy that we have reached this agreement and hope we now have a clear path to the conclusion of this transaction,” SABMiller Chief Executive Officer Alan Clark said. The $100 billion-plus takeover of SAB has also included concessions made to the South African government.  Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, which will account for 40 percent of all Coke volumes sold in Africa, will be headquartered in South Africa, its largest market. The deal will also hand Coke an extra 20 brands, including  soft drink Appletiser, whose fruit juice concentrate is sourced from South African producers. Coca-Cola and SABMiller agreed to maintain and grow Appletiser operations for the domestic market and use it as a base for export.

803,KO,Production of Coke halted in Venezuela for lack of sugar,"(Reuters) - The Venezuelan bottler of Coca-Cola has halted production of the sugar-sweetened beverage due to a lack of sugar, a Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) spokeswoman said on Monday. Venezuela is in the midst of a deep recession, and spontaneous demonstrations and looting have become more common amid worsening food shortages, frequent power cuts and the world’s highest inflation. Production of sugar-sweetened drinks has stopped, but output of diet drinks such as Coca-Cola light and other zero-sugar beverages continued, spokeswoman Kerry Tressler wrote by email.  “Sugar suppliers in Venezuela have informed us that they will temporarily cease operations due to a lack of raw materials,” Tressler added. Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL.MX), Latin America’s biggest coke bottler and operator of four plants in Venezuela, added that it was hoping the nation’s sugar inventories would recover “in the short term.” The bottler, which gets some 7 percent of its income in Venezuela, is a joint venture between Coca-Cola and Mexico’s Femsa (FMSAUBD.MX). Over the past several years, the combination of price controls, rising production costs, lack of foreign exchange, restrictive labor laws, and a lack of basic inputs such as fertilizer, have resulted in a drop in Venezuela’s sugar cane production with fewer planted hectares (acres) and lower yields. Many smaller farmers have turned to other crops that are not price controlled and thus provide greater income. The country is expected to produce 430,000 tonnes in 2016/17, down from 450,000 tonnes the previous year, and import 850,000 tonnes of raw and refined sugar, according to the USDA.

808,KO,Fitch Rates Coca-Cola's Benchmark Issuance 'A+'; Outlook Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The  Coca-Cola Company's (Coca-Cola) multi-tranche proposed benchmark issuance of  senior notes including senior notes due 2019 and senior notes due 2026. The  Rating Outlook is Negative. Coca-Cola had approximately $46.8 billion of debt as  of April 1, 2016. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this release. The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with the company's  senior unsecured obligations. Coca-Cola will use the net proceeds for general  corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures,  acquisitions of or investments in businesses or assets, redemption and repayment  of short-term or long-term borrowings and common stock purchases. KEY RATING DRIVERS Persistently Elevated Leverage  The Negative Outlook reflects Coca-Cola's elevated leverage (on both a gross  leverage and supplemental net leverage basis) as high for the current ratings.  Moreover, Fitch needs to see progress related to refranchising and evidence that  Coca-Cola will adhere to a more balanced capital allocation strategy related to  share repurchases, dividends and debt reduction. The Outlook could be stabilized  with a public commitment over the next 12 months toward a deleveraging policy.  Fitch would need to see clear visibility and traction on gross leverage  declining below 3x and supplemental net leverage below 2x as the company  transitions to a franchising model, produces at least 3% organic top-line growth  and sees EBITDA improvement through targeted productivity initiatives.  Long-term Business Model Strengthened  Fitch believes Coca-Cola's long-term business model will strengthen as a result  of accelerated refranchising plans. While refranchising will cause some  near-term EBITDA dilution, Coca-Cola will receive upfront cash proceeds that  will be used for debt reduction and an annuity stream related to bottling assets  to offset this decline. Moreover, over time, the refranchising will  substantially reduce SG&A; costs, increase gross margins to the upper 60% range,  result in operating margins that improve to the mid-30% range from approximately  24%, and significantly reduce capex intensity. Consequently, upon completion of  refranchising in 2017, Coca-Cola's underlying cash flows are expected to be more  stable providing greater support to its longer-term credit profile.  Coca-Cola's $3 billion productivity program to be completed by 2019 also  provides additional benefits to operating profit and cash generation. While  Coca-Cola is using a portion of these savings to support brand strength by  increasing media and R&D; spending, cost reductions should help drive future  growth in operating profit. Consequently, Fitch views Coca-Cola's long-term  mid-single-digit revenue and high-single-digit profit before tax financial  targets as achievable.  More Balanced Capital Allocation Expected  Coca-Cola generates substantial overseas cash flows due to its position as the  world's largest non-alcoholic beverage company and has been reluctant to  repatriate foreign earnings given the tax consequences. Accordingly, foreign  cash balances have grown along with debt including larger commercial paper (CP)  balances to fund domestic cash requirements for the dividend, U.S. capital  investment, share repurchase program and strategic M&A; activities.  Coca-Cola is in the process of implementing a more appropriate longer-term  capital allocation policy to improve the alignment of domestic cash generation  versus domestic cash requirements that should benefit its longer-term financial  structure. These steps include: a reduced reliance on CP usage to below $15  billion, a more balanced long-term share repurchase policy including reductions  for material M&A; activity, a more conservative pace of dividend growth, and  using a portion of refranchising proceeds for debt reduction.  CP balances have declined to $14.9 billion at the end of the first quarter 2016  from a peak of approximately $19 billion as Coca-Cola has committed to reduce  its reliance on this funding source, although overall debt increased by $2.2  billion in 2015. CP as a percent of total debt is currently approximately 32%,  which compares to peak usage of approximately 50% of total debt. Fitch expects  Coca-Cola will maintain CP balances below $15 billion over the long term  compared to a past soft cap of $20 billion.  Supplemental Net Leverage Expected to Decline  For U.S. issuers, Fitch currently excludes foreign cash balances from its  definition of readily available cash used to calculate net leverage metrics.  Fitch recognizes that these cash balances are an asset that may be accessed and  used to reduce debt in the event it is necessary. Therefore, for certain issuers  with significant levels of foreign cash positions, like Coca-Cola, supplemental  adjusted net leverage ratios are used when gauging the level of  tolerance/cushion within the assigned ratings. Foreign cash balances are reduced  by applying a generic 35% tax haircut and a further adjustment capturing  expectations for additional foreign cash balances that could be used for  shareholder-friendly actions. In its calculations, Fitch haircuts after-tax  foreign cash balances by 25% to accommodate for share buybacks.  Fitch expects long-term gross debt, inclusive of CP, to decline during the next  several years with a more balanced capital allocation policy. Supplemental  adjusted EBITDA net leverage for Coca-Cola at the end of the first quarter 2016  was approximately 2.7x compared to 2.3x at the end of 2014. Over the longer  term, Fitch expects supplemental net leverage will decrease to around 2x in  2018/2019 due to debt reduction and EBITDA growth.  Strong Global Brands  As the world's largest global beverage company, Coca-Cola's ratings are  supported by its strong market shares, extensive geographic diversity, strong  distribution platform and valuable brand equity. Coca-Cola has more than 20 $1  billion-plus brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute  Maid, Fanta Orange, Schweppes and Dasani. The strong brands, geographic reach,  market position and diversification afford considerable support to Coca-Cola's  business profile that has led to stable, sustainable cash flows. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's beverage  portfolio and constituting approximately 73% of the mix, the ratings consider  the multiyear declines in CSD volumes in the U.S., continued concern over  artificial sweeteners affecting diet CSD demand in North America, risks  associated with excise tax increases and slowing growth in other developing  countries. Fitch believes this risk is mitigated in part by Coca-Cola's market  strength in developing and emerging geographies with greater long-term growth  characteristics driven by low per-capita CSD consumption characteristics,  urbanization, population growth, and expanding middle class that should provide  an important longer-term offset.  Coca-Cola, along with the rest of the beverage industry, have also modified  their price/mix strategy, primarily in developed markets, to focus on both  smaller pack size and premium/alternative packaging to drive a higher price per  unit versus its past volume focus. Consumers are increasingly seeking premium  and smaller-sized offerings as evidenced by the low-double-digit growth rates  within this packaging combination mix.  Underlying Growth Should Improve  Fitch expects underlying revenue growth in 2016 of approximately 3.6% with  volume growth of 1.8%, price/mix growth of 1.8% and foreign currency pressure of  4%. Beyond 2016, Fitch believes Coca-Cola should be able to improve organic  growth rates during the medium term to close to 5% on volume growth of 3% and  product/mix of 2%. Fitch expects underlying operating income growth will  increase in 2016 by almost 7% driven by productivity benefits and organic  growth. Coca-Cola's productivity savings program enables additional financial  flexibility over the next several years to cover incremental investments and  costs that will be used in part for increased media investments and brand  support development. Coca-Cola has already redirected $600 million in previous  productivity savings toward increased media spending and expects to increase  spending by up to $200 million-$400 million more during the next two years.  CCR Ratings:  Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola  Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations, since default risk is very low  at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to the  notes issued by Coca-Cola. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its 2016 rating case for Coca-Cola include:  --Underlying revenue growth of approximately 3.6% with volume growth  approximately 1.8%, price/mix growth of approximately 1.8% and foreign currency  pressure of 4% in 2016;  --Underlying operating income growth is estimated to increase by almost 7%;  --Coca-Cola generates approximately $10 billion of cash flow from operations  (CFFO) with more than 50% of Coca-Cola's CFFO available for domestic use. Free  cash flow (FCF) in excess of $1.5 billion in 2016;  --Total debt increases marginally as borrowings to fund domestic cash  requirements are expected to moderate;  --Net share repurchases of $2.25 billion;  --Capital spending of $2.5 billion;  --Gross leverage of 3.7x and net supplemental leverage of 2.7x.  Over the forecast period through 2019 and once refranchising is complete,  assumptions include:  --Gross margin increasing to the high 60% range;  --Operating margins increasing to the mid 30% range;  --Gross debt levels declining from a current level of $44.2 billion through  proceeds from asset sales combined with a more balanced capital allocation  policy;  --Gross leverage of 3x times and net supplemental leverage reducing to less than  2x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  stabilization of the Rating Outlook include:  --A public commitment toward a deleveraging policy over the next 12 months. This  commitment would be reflective of achieving a more balanced capital allocation  policy with a pullback in share repurchases and a commitment to reduce gross  debt levels.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include:  --A lack of deleveraging such that gross leverage is sustained above 3x and  supplemental adjusted EBITDA net leverage is sustained above 2x over the  long-term;  --A lack of public commitment to debt reduction;  --A lack of execution with refranchising plans;  --Productivity program does not fully deliver expected cost benefits;  --A more aggressive financial strategy related to dividend, M&A; and share  repurchases. LIQUIDITY Strong Cash Generation, Sizeable Offshore Cash Position  Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to generate considerable CFFO  and FCF. For the LTM period, Coca-Cola generated $9.6 billion and $1.2 billion  (adjusting for dividend payment) of CFFO and FCF, respectively. As of April 1,  2016, Coca-Cola's approximate $28 billion liquidity position consisted of $22.2  billion of cash, short-term investments and marketable securities, and $8.3  billion of availability under its committed credit lines and revolving credit  facility with rolling maturities through 2019. Coca-Cola's long-term debt  maturing in the next 12 months is substantial, totalling $5 billion.  Coca-Cola maintains a sizeable offshore cash position due to the company's  substantial international cash generation. Of the $22.2 billion in cash,  short-term investments and marketable securities, the majority was held by  foreign subsidiaries. Foreign cash balances increased during the first quarter  of 2016, when Coca-Cola received $2.4 billion for its ownership interest in  Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. following its acquisition by JAB Holding Company. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Coca-Cola and its subsidiary as follows: The Coca-Cola Company --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Bank credit facilities 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'. Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (CCR) --Long-term IDR 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

814,KO,"Coke, Coke Femsa to buy Unilever's soy beverage business","(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Femsa (KOFL.MX), said they agreed to buy Unilever’s (ULVR.L) AdeS soy-based beverage unit for about $575 million as the soft-drinks giant bolsters its portfolio of healthy and non-fizzy drinks. AdeS, which is known for its soy-milk and fruit-juice mixed beverages, had revenue of $284 million in 2015. It sold 56.2 million unit cases in the same period. Founded in 1988 in Argentina, AdeS’ drinks are sold in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile and Colombia, the companies said in a statement. Coke has been investing in building its non-carbonated drinks portfolio and is expanding beyond North America, its biggest market, where sales have been falling due to a consumer shift towards healthier beverages. The company bought a 40 percent stake in Nigerian juice maker Chi Ltd in January and spent $400 million to buy multi-grain drinks maker China Culiangwang Beverages Holdings Ltd (0904.HK) in April last year.  Coke, whose non-fizzy brands include vitaminwater, Powerade and Minute Maid, said AdeS will be part of the non-carbonated beverage business that Coca-Cola Femsa shares with Coca-Cola in its franchise territories.  For Unilever, the sale is the latest in a string of divestitures aimed at moving away from slow-growing food brands in order to focus more on personal care businesses, which have higher margins and higher growth prospects.  The Anglo-Dutch company has sold businesses including Slim-Fast diet products, Ragu pasta sauces and Bifi meat snacks.

815,KO,U.S. impounds PureCircle stevia under new forced labor law,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States has seized low-calorie sweetener stevia imported from China by PureCircle Ltd, making it the latest company to be targeted by a new law that bans imports of products made by forced labor. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it moved to crack down on imports of stevia extracts and their derivatives from China brought into the country by PureCircle after it obtained information that they are produced by convict labor. The plant extract is used as a sweetener in Coca-Cola Co’s Coke Life, PepsiCo’s True and other popular sodas. A spokeswoman for PureCircle disputed the allegation, stating the company has provided documentation it has not worked with Inner Mongolia Hengzheng Group Baoanzhao Agricultural and Trade LLC, which was also named in the complaint.  “We have an explicit policy prohibiting use of prison or forced labor in any part of our business,” she said in an emailed statement, noting it is certified by independent auditors to ensure that. Singapore-based Olam International Ltd owns a 17.8 percent stake in PureCircle, a major supplier of sugar and aspartame alternatives, according to PureCircle’s website.   The companies have three months to prove the stevia was not produced by force labor, a spokeswoman for the U.S. agency said on Wednesday. “It is imperative that companies examine their supply chains to understand product sourcing and the labor used to generate their products,” the agency Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske said in a statement. Responding to the news, Coke said its supplier had confirmed it had not received stevia produced by the accused Inner Mongolia company. Company policy prohibits the use of forced labor in its operations and supply chain, Coke said in an email. The action is the latest sign that the new legislation, which bans imports of goods made by forced labor, could have a far-reaching impact on companies that buy ingredients from abroad as the United States pushes to improve transparency across global supply chains. The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 was signed into law in February. This is the third product seizure since the law came into effect.  Imports of potassium and other related products brought in by Tangshan Sunfar Silicon Industries have been impounded and shipments of soda ash and other chemicals by Tangshan Sanyou Group and its subsidiaries have been seized.

818,KO,Wall St pours money into consumer staples as valuations climb,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Investors looking for stability and dividends have been pouring money into consumer staples stocks of late, ignoring warnings from Wall Street’s analysts about pricey valuations for companies like Clorox (CLX.N) and Campbell Soup (CPB.N). Widely viewed as relatively safe bets in a world of macroeconomic worries, shares of companies selling everyday consumer products like processed food and cleaning supplies have outperformed most other sectors in the past year, and fund flow data suggests investors expect more of the same. The number of new institutional owners, like hedge funds, pension funds and mutual funds, of Campbell Soup in the last quarter has jumped 92 percent, according to research firm Morningstar. New institutional owners of Coca Cola Co rose 81 percent. In the past two weeks, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPRD ETF (XLP) attracted $333 million in net flows while just $105 million went into the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR fund (XLY), according to ETF.com. With relatively high dividend yields, including a 4 percent annual payout to shareholders from Philip Morris International (PM.N), consumer staples companies remain a key holding for investors worried about a shaky global economy, even as the United States shows signs of slow improvement.  Consumer staples companies in the S&P; 500 are expected on average to post 3.7 percent higher earnings in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That is better than an expected 0.8-percent increase across the S&P; 500 but not as good as the 12.4-percent earnings jump predicted for the consumer discretionary sector.  “We still want a fair amount of exposure to staples,” said Thomas Martin, a portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments, which owns shares in Campbell, Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O), Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL.N), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N) and tobacco companies.  “The economy is still bumping along on a slow-growth trajectory,” he said. The S&P; consumer staples index .SPLRCS now trades at about 20 times expected earnings, compared with 17 for the consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Following the consumer staples index’s 12 percent rise in the past year, some analysts warn of high valuations, with General Mills (GIS.N), Procter & Gamble (PG.N) and most other companies in the sector trading above 20 times expected earnings, compared with an average of 17 across the S&P; 500. “On the consumer defensive side, we view in general the industry as a bit inflated,” said Morningstar analyst Erin Lash.  A year ago, Campbell Soup, Kellogg (K.N), McCormick & Company (MKC.N) and Clorox were among the 10 S&P; 500 stocks with the worst average recommendations by sell-side analysts. Many of them warned about a strong dollar’s impact on demand overseas and stagnant sales as consumer tastes shifted toward fresher foods. But since then, those stocks have each gained between 21 percent and 31 percent, lifted by cost-cutting initiatives that have improved margins and progress updating their product lineups to appeal to new consumer tastes for “natural” and organic food. The S&P; 500 is up 1 percent from a year ago. ",6062016,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-consumerstaples-stocks/wall-st-pours-money-into-consumer-staples-as-valuations-climb-idUSL1N18S1FH
819,KO,UPDATE 1-AmazonFresh cranks up pressure on British supermarkets,"LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon (AMZN.O) has launched a British version of its U.S. AmazonFresh food delivery service, stepping up the pressure on the traditional big supermarkets already locked in a brutal price war. In a long-anticipated move to break into Britain’s 178 billion pounds ($257 billion) grocery market, the world’s largest online retailer launched AmazonFresh on Thursday in parts of central and east London. Britain has one of the world’s most developed online grocery markets with the big four retailers Tesco (TSCO.L), Sainsbury’s (SBRY.L), Wal-Mart’s (WMT.N) Asda and Morrisons (MRW.L) already competing with specialist delivery firm Ocado (OCDO.L). The online grocery bar is even higher in the capital. “The entry of AmazonFresh into the UK doesn’t come out of the blue but it will further worry investors about the fundamentals and prospects of the UK food retail market,” said Bernstein analysts, who estimate Amazon could eventually take up to 13 percent of all food sales in the country. Britain’s online food market is expected to nearly double to 17.2 billion pounds in the five years to 2020, according to industry research group IGD. “We are launching with a comprehensive offer in a limited area and will take our time to hone and improve our service,” AmazonFresh vice president Ajay Kavan said. AmazonFresh will initially offer a full grocery service from a distribution center in the east of the capital. It plans to use small and medium-sized external carriers for deliveries, which could be on the same day as the order. Shares in Britain’s listed supermarkets have been hammered in recent years as the grocery market has been convulsed by changing shopping habits, the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl and price competition, and analysts see AmazonFresh as a potential challenge to the whole industry over time. “We will be very methodical and considered in how we roll this service out further in the UK,” Kavan said. Shoppers in the eligible London districts, or postcodes, who are members of the Amazon Prime subscription service will be able to choose from a range of more than 130,000 products, including about 20,000 grocery items. Amazon will offer fresh and frozen products from Morrisons, with which it struck a wholesale supply deal in February, brands including Coca-Cola, Kellogg’s, Danone, Warburtons and Walkers as well as products from local food producers and shops in locations such as London’s trendy Borough Market. Amazon Prime members in the United Kingdom pay an annual subscription of 79 pounds. They can sign up for a 30-day trial of AmazonFresh and would then pay 6.99 pounds per month for the service, with unlimited deliveries for orders over 40 pounds. In the short term, Bernstein analysts reckon AmazonFresh’s focus on London and its upmarket bias could mean Sainsbury’s is hit the most out of the Big Four. But they said Tesco and Ocado are also exposed as they have the largest share of London-based online food sales. There was, however, little impact on stock prices following the AmazonFresh launch. In April, Sainsbury’s agreed a 1.4 billion pound takeover of Argos, a move which was seen as a defensive play against Amazon. One food retail executive from one of the big four players said Amazon would only significantly disrupt the market if it could successfully target the 60 percent of store sales that are just small baskets. “If Amazon can work out how to deliver those top up shops profitably and in a timely manner then I think we’ll see other retailers respond and that’s likely to grow the overall market share of online sales from around the 7 percent mark and accelerate the growth,” he told Reuters. Amazon launched a fresh food delivery service in Seattle in 2007 and has since moved to a handful of other U.S. cities, but it has struggled to find the best pricing model. It has offered some food and drink items to British customers since 2010, and in November extended a packaged groceries offer already available in Germany and Japan to Prime members in Britain.

824,KO,"PepsiCo, Coca-Cola still sparkle in Mexico after fizzy drinks tax","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Flat beverages are helping overall sales at Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc stay fizzy in Mexico despite a tax on sodas.  As Mexico moved toward implementing a soda tax to combat soaring rates of obesity and diabetes three years ago, the beverage industry fought back hard, warning that sales in the world’s No. 2 consumer of sugary drinks could take a hit.  But more than two years later, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have found ways to prosper in Mexico thanks to alternative beverages and resilient demand, a Reuters review of corporate filings and executive comments shows. On Thursday, PepsiCo Chairman and Chief Executive Indra Nooyi described the nation, the biggest for net revenue after the United States, as “one of the brightest stars” in Latin America amid turmoil in Venezuela and Brazil. “We feel good about our business in Mexico,” she said in the company’s second-quarter earnings call.     PepsiCo’s shares popped to record highs on Thursday after its earnings of $1.35 a share beat analyst estimates. After the tax was implemented in January 2014, beverage sales volumes declined for one quarter in Pepsi’s case and two quarters for Coke. Since then, both have posted consistent growth in volumes in Mexico. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo both declined to comment.  Growth in other drinks the companies produce, like bottled water and juice, has contributed to that resilience. General economic growth in the country has also helped.  As U.S. municipalities and states, as well as other countries, increasingly entertain the idea of slapping a tax on sugary drinks to help combat obesity and diabetes, the sales bounce-back in Mexico suggests that such policies are not necessarily calamitous for major beverage companies. Mexico is the biggest country with a nationwide tax on sugary drinks, and the outcomes in terms of health and revenue are closely studied by public health researchers and industry groups alike. Soda taxes are a concern for the sugar industry, which is worried about waning long-term demand for sweeteners. The companies’ growth in sales volumes has come as individual Mexicans drink less soda - a sign the tax is having its intended effect, public health advocates say.  Mexico’s per-capita consumption dropped 4 percent to 134 liters in 2014, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor. It continued to fall in 2015 and is forecast to inch down in 2016 to 132.2 liters per capita.  Bottled water consumption, meanwhile, has soared 50 percent in the past decade.  That mirrors declining soda consumption elsewhere in the world. The leading producers are well aware of this and have been diversifying accordingly.  In 2010, still beverages - including waters, teas and juices - represented just 29 percent of Coca-Cola’s U.S. volume and 22 percent elsewhere, a company filing shows. Sparkling beverages, namely sodas, made up the rest.  By 2015, still beverages made up a third and 26 percent of U.S. and worldwide sales volume, respectively.    “It’s not just a carbonated soft drink game anymore,” said Adam Fleck, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago.  Despite the per-capita decline, overall soda volumes are bubbling up.

825,KO,"PepsiCo, Coca-Cola still sparkle in Mexico after fizzy drinks tax","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Flat beverages are helping overall sales at Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc stay fizzy in Mexico despite a tax on sodas.  As Mexico moved toward implementing a soda tax to combat soaring rates of obesity and diabetes three years ago, the beverage industry fought back hard, warning that sales in the world’s No. 2 consumer of sugary drinks could take a hit.  But more than two years later, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have found ways to prosper in Mexico thanks to alternative beverages and resilient demand, a Reuters review of corporate filings and executive comments shows. On Thursday, PepsiCo Chairman and Chief Executive Indra Nooyi described the nation, the biggest for net revenue after the United States, as “one of the brightest stars” in Latin America amid turmoil in Venezuela and Brazil. “We feel good about our business in Mexico,” she said in the company’s second-quarter earnings call.     PepsiCo’s shares popped to record highs on Thursday after its earnings of $1.35 a share beat analyst estimates. After the tax was implemented in January 2014, beverage sales volumes declined for one quarter in Pepsi’s case and two quarters for Coke. Since then, both have posted consistent growth in volumes in Mexico. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo both declined to comment.  Growth in other drinks the companies produce, like bottled water and juice, has contributed to that resilience. General economic growth in the country has also helped.  As U.S. municipalities and states, as well as other countries, increasingly entertain the idea of slapping a tax on sugary drinks to help combat obesity and diabetes, the sales bounce-back in Mexico suggests that such policies are not necessarily calamitous for major beverage companies. Mexico is the biggest country with a nationwide tax on sugary drinks, and the outcomes in terms of health and revenue are closely studied by public health researchers and industry groups alike. Soda taxes are a concern for the sugar industry, which is worried about waning long-term demand for sweeteners. The companies’ growth in sales volumes has come as individual Mexicans drink less soda - a sign the tax is having its intended effect, public health advocates say.  Mexico’s per-capita consumption dropped 4 percent to 134 liters in 2014, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor. It continued to fall in 2015 and is forecast to inch down in 2016 to 132.2 liters per capita.  Bottled water consumption, meanwhile, has soared 50 percent in the past decade.  That mirrors declining soda consumption elsewhere in the world. The leading producers are well aware of this and have been diversifying accordingly.  In 2010, still beverages - including waters, teas and juices - represented just 29 percent of Coca-Cola’s U.S. volume and 22 percent elsewhere, a company filing shows. Sparkling beverages, namely sodas, made up the rest.  By 2015, still beverages made up a third and 26 percent of U.S. and worldwide sales volume, respectively.    “It’s not just a carbonated soft drink game anymore,” said Adam Fleck, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago.  Despite the per-capita decline, overall soda volumes are bubbling up. After falling in 2014 and 2015, volumes grew 2 percent between January and April of 2016 compared with the same period a year earlier, according to Anprac, Mexico’s national beverage industry association.  The per-capita drop is also leveling off, as the tax’s sticker shock wears off.  Despite the refreshing news, the industry has maintained opposition to soda taxes elsewhere.

826,KO,Britain's FTSE pulls back from 11-month closing high,"* FTSE 100 flat at close * Rio Tinto production update underwhelms * Mining stocks top fallers * Coca-Cola HBC gains after upgrade   (Adds detail and updates prices at close) By Kit Rees and Alistair Smout LONDON, July 19 (Reuters) - Britain’s top share index steadied on Tuesday, easing back from an 11-month closing high, with mining stocks dropping after a production update from Rio Tinto. Britain’s FTSE 100 was flat in percentage terms at 6,697.37 points at its close, after closing on Monday at its highest since August last year. Rio Tinto’s decline was among the largest; it fell.5 percent after its latest update. Traders said that Rio Tinto’s second-quarter figures were a little disappointing, even as it reiterated its 2017 outlook. “Growth in iron ore output decelerated from 13 percent year-on-year in Q1 to 8 percent in Q2 but production growth accelerated in bauxite, aluminium and also copper, which will do little to ease the market’s fears that key commodities could remain glutted for some time to come,” said Russ Mould, Investment Director at AJ Bell, in a note. In all, FTSE 350 mining stocks dropped 2.4 percent, their biggest daily loss in a month. Top riser on the FTSE 100 was Coca-Cola HBC, up more than 3 percent after the bottling company was upgraded to “overweight” from neutral by JP Morgan Cazenove. “The soft drinks category is very resilient to macroeconomic volatility, which bodes well for CCH given current uncertainty in Europe,” analysts at JP Morgan said in a note. “We believe CCH is well placed to take on additional bottling assets in key territories.” Reflecting that uncertainty in Europe, the latest German ZEW showed a big fall in economic sentiment since Britain voted to leave the European Union nearly a month ago. In a similar vein, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) cited Brexit-related uncertainty as it cut its global growth forecasts for the next two years. However, the FTSE 100 is up 5.6 percent since the vote, with its substantial international exposure and defensive composition meaning it has weathered the period since the referendum better than major European indexes.

The Fed had not been expected to move interest rates at its two-day meeting but investors have been anxious for hints about when a hike might come following concerns about potential fallout from Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union. The U.S. central bank indicated less worry about possible shocks that could push the U.S. economy off course and noted that inflation expectations were little changed in recent months. “It sounded a reasonably upbeat tone, not a big difference from last time, but a reasonably upbeat tone,” said Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab and Co in New York. Major stock indexes reversed losses following the announcement. At 2:19 p.m. (1819 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average  was up 36.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 18,509.97, the S&P; 500 had lost 0.12 point, or 0.01 percent, to 2,169.06.

830,KO,CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Femsa's profit jumps on Mexico retail strength,"(Corrects to show that Coke Femsa’s partner in new cooperation framework is Coca-Cola Co, not Femsa, paragraph 8) MEXICO CITY, July 27 (Reuters) - Mexican bottler and retailer Fomento Economico Mexicano (Femsa) said on Wednesday that second-quarter net profit rose more than a quarter compared with the year-earlier period, helped by its fast-growing retail division. Femsa said net majority income was up 25.9 percent to 4.873 billion pesos ($267 million) in the April to June period. In its retail division the company opened 263 net new Oxxo convenience stores in the quarter. Retail revenue rose 12.6 percent, while Oxxo same-store sales grew more than 5 percent. Retail sales in Mexico rose for the fourth time in five months in May, as consumer spending continued to support growth in the economy. Revenue also jumped 25.9 percent to 94.543 billion pesos, driven by the integration of Chilean pharmacy operator Socofar, in which it acquired a majority stake last year. Femsa subsidiary Coca-Cola Femsa, Latin America’s largest Coke bottler, reported a 25 percent fall in second-quarter profit on Wednesday, hurt by lower margins and higher raw material costs. Shares of Femsa were down 0.8 percent at 174.26 pesos at about noon local time, while Coke Femsa shares were down 2.3 percent at 144.13 pesos. Coke Femsa said it had reached a new cooperation framework with Coca-Cola Co. Under the deal, concentrate prices for sparkling beverages in Mexico will gradually rise over three years from July 2017, it said. That will cost Coke Femsa around $35 million more a year in 2017, 2018 and 2019, it estimated. Coke Femsa, which operates across Latin America and also in the Philippines, said that second-quarter profit was hurt by higher sugar prices. It added that the depreciation of the average exchange rate of the Argentine peso, the Brazilian real, the Colombian peso and the Mexican peso also increased its raw material costs, which are denominated in U.S. dollars. Coke Femsa said sales rose 9.3 percent to 39.93 billion pesos.

The Fed is scheduled to issue a statement at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) after a two-day policy meeting, which began on Tuesday. While the central bank is expected to keep rates steady for now, the recent set of strong economic data could strengthen the case for an increase earlier than the market anticipates.

832,KO,"Coca-Cola's revenue misses on weak China, LatAm markets","(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue due to weakness in China and certain Latin American economies, and the company warned of no improvement in those markets for the rest of the year. Shares of the world’s largest beverage maker, which also cut its full-year organic revenue growth forecast, fell 3.63 percent to a more than three-month low of $43.25 on Wednesday. Sales in China are being pressured as wholesalers bring down inventory levels in response to weakening consumer environment in the country, Chief Operating Officer James Quincey said on a post-earnings conference call. China’s economy grew 6.7 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace since the global financial crisis.  Coke said it was working to combat changing consumer tastes in China, such as the growing demand for premium water and the falling popularity of its juices, by introducing more premium offerings and expanding in second-tier and rural areas with more affordable products.  The company, like several other multinational companies, is also struggling with high levels of inflation in some Latin American economies, including Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. Quincey said recent steps taken by Argentina to improve its economy caused a near-term contraction that accelerated in the second quarter, impacting the company’s business there. Latin America accounted for 9 percent of Coca-Cola’s total revenue in 2015. Coke reduced its forecast for organic revenue growth to 3 percent in 2016 from 4-5 percent growth estimated earlier. Organic revenue excludes the impact of currency movements, acquisitions and divestitures. Revenue from North America, the company’s largest market, rose 2 percent in the second quarter ended July 1, while revenue fell in all other regions. The company’s net operating revenue fell 5.1 percent to $11.54 billion, the fifth straight quarter of decline. Coke and rival PepsiCo Inc PEP.N have been struggling as consumers increasingly turn health-conscious and cut back on fizzy drinks and opt for teas, fruit juices and smoothies. Coke has responded by building its non-carbonated drinks portfolio, expanding beyond North America and cutting costs by refranchising its bottling operations.  Net income attributable to shareholders rose 11 percent to $3.45 billion, or 79 cents per share, in the quarter. Excluding items, the company earned 60 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 58 cents per share on revenue of $11.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Coca-Cola also said on Wednesday it signed letters of intent with two U.S. bottlers to expand distribution areas in two states.

840,KO,UPDATE 2-Coca-Cola HBC upbeat on full year after first-half profit rises,"LONDON (Reuters) - Soft drink bottler Coca-Cola HBC (CCH.L) forecast modest sales volume growth for the full year after a roughly flat first half, citing slowing declines in Russia and continued growth in Nigeria, helping to lift its shares more than 5 percent. The company, which bottles Coca-Cola (KO.N) drinks in 28 countries, also reported a bigger-than-expected improvement in earnings, helped by cost-cutting and lower commodity costs. Its shares were the top gainer on London's FTSE 100 index .FTSE, up 5.5 percent at 0810 GMT. Comparable earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) rose 4.8 percent to 229.6 million euros in the six months to July 1, topping consensus estimates of around 220 million, according to analysts. Its EBIT margin was 7.5 percent, up from 7 percent a year ago. Sales revenue fell 3.4 percent to 3.04 billion euros ($3.4 billion), but rose 2.4 percent excluding currency fluctuations. It rose 3 percent excluding the impact of one less selling day, which will be given back in the second half of the year. The company cited price increases, selling more higher-priced drinks, and volume growth in markets including Nigeria and Romania. Overall volume though was up 0.1 percent. Despite tough comparisons with a strong year-earlier period, the company said volumes “held up well” in July, making it confident of “volume growth for the year as a whole”. “We do forecast an improvement (in the back half),” Chief Executive Dimitris Lois told reporters. “This improvement reflects one more selling day and additional initiatives we have focusing on very strong marketing calendars.”  The company is also bringing forward some restructuring initiatives from 2017 into 2016, primarily in emerging markets like Russia and Nigeria. It now plans to spend 48 million euros this year, instead of 35 million euros, so it can more quickly benefit from the resulting operational efficiencies.  It said volumes in emerging markets should improve as declines in Russia slow and Nigeria grows, despite the recent depreciation of the Nigerian currency.  After a slowdown in the second quarter, resulting from the devaluation, Lois said conditions in the country should normalize, and he reaffirmed his forecast for Nigerian sales to rise at a mid- to high-single-digit rate this year. In June, the company said its medium-term forecast called for average annual revenue growth of 4 to 5 percent through 2020, with operating expenses dropping to 26 to 27 percent of revenue and an EBIT margin rising to 11 percent.

Comparable earnings per share were 0.42 euros, up 6.9 percent from year earlier period.

844,KO,Coke bottler to rethink South Africa spending plans due to sugar tax,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Africa’s biggest Coke bottler, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, will rethink its spending plans in South Africa if Pretoria’s proposed tax on sugary drinks gets the green light, a spokeswoman said on Thursday.  In a bid to fight a growing obesity rate in the continent’s most lucrative market for Coca-Cola and fast-food chains in sub-Saharan Africa, the government has proposed a 20 percent tax on sugar sweetened drinks under a plan that has delighted health campaigners and angered drink makers. Coca-Cola Beverages Africa was created earlier this year through a combination of SABMiller and Coca-Cola African soft drink operations. The deal won an anti-trust go-ahead on several conditions that included a commitment to spend 800 million rand to develop farmers and retailers. “It is not what the company is wanting to do but when you look at the impact the tax would have, we will have relook at some investment commitments we have made,” said Coca-Cola southern African spokeswoman Vukani Magubane. The proposed levy, which was first announced by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in February, is expected to be implemented this year. Last month, the Treasury has asked the public submit comments on the proposal by Aug. 22. It has already received endorsement from lobby group Public Health Association of South Africa, saying it was a cheaper intervention measure to fight obesity-linked diseases such as diabetes. More than half of South Africa’s adults are overweight, with 42 percent of women and 13 percent of men obese, according to National Treasury data. Sub-Sahara’s most industrialized economy also has its most overweight population, the figures show. A local soft drinks industry body, Beverage Association of South Africa, has already dismissed the proposed tax as “discriminatory” and warned it could lead to job losses. The industry employs about 200,000 people. Britain on Thursday launched a strategy to tax companies selling sugary soft drinks, joining Belgium, France, Hungary and Mexico, all of which have imposed some form of tax on drinks with added sugar. Scandinavian countries have levied similar taxes for many years.

847,KO,Fitch Rates Coca-Cola's Benchmark Issuance 'A+'; Outlook Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 29 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The  Coca-Cola Company's (Coca-Cola) multi-tranche proposed benchmark issuance of  senior notes including senior notes due 2021 and senior notes due 2026. The  Rating Outlook is Negative. Coca-Cola had approximately $48 billion of debt as  of July 1, 2016. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this release. The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with the company's  senior unsecured obligations. Coca-Cola will use the net proceeds for general  corporate purposes, which may include working capital, capital expenditures,  acquisitions of or investments in businesses or assets, redemption and repayment  of short-term or long-term borrowings and common stock purchases. KEY RATING DRIVERS Persistently Elevated Leverage  The Negative Outlook reflects Coca-Cola's elevated leverage (on both a gross  leverage and supplemental net leverage basis) as high for the current ratings.  To stabilize the Outlook, Fitch would need to see progress related to  refranchising and evidence that Coca-Cola will adhere to a more balanced capital  allocation strategy related to share repurchases, dividends and debt reduction.  The Outlook stabilization would be contingent upon demonstration of a public  commitment toward a deleveraging policy including: clear visibility and traction  on gross leverage declining below 3x and supplemental net leverage below 2x as  the company transitions to a franchising model, produces at least 3% organic  top-line growth and sees EBITDA improvement through targeted productivity  initiatives.  Long-term Business Model Strengthened  Fitch believes Coca-Cola's long-term business model will strengthen as a result  of accelerated refranchising plans. While refranchising will cause some  near-term EBITDA dilution, the company will receive upfront cash proceeds that  will be used for debt reduction and an annuity stream related to bottling assets  to offset this decline. Moreover, over time, the refranchising will  substantially reduce SG&A; costs, increase gross margins to the upper 60% range,  result in operating margins that improve to the mid-30% range from approximately  24%, and significantly reduce capex intensity. Consequently, upon completion of  refranchising in 2017, Coca-Cola's underlying cash flows are expected to be more  stable providing greater support to its longer-term credit profile.  Coca-Cola's $3 billion productivity program to be completed by 2019 also  provides additional benefits to operating profit and cash generation. While  Coca-Cola is using a portion of these savings to support brand strength by  increasing media and R&D; spending, cost reductions should help drive future  growth in operating profit. Consequently, Fitch views Coca-Cola's long-term  mid-single-digit revenue and high-single-digit profit before tax financial  targets as achievable.  More Balanced Capital Allocation Expected  Coca-Cola generates substantial overseas cash flows due to its position as the  world's largest non-alcoholic beverage company and has been reluctant to  repatriate foreign earnings given the tax consequences. Accordingly, foreign  cash balances have grown along with debt including larger commercial paper (CP)  balances to fund domestic cash requirements for the dividend, U.S. capital  investment, share repurchase program and strategic M&A; activities.  Coca-Cola is in the process of implementing a more appropriate longer-term  capital allocation policy to improve the alignment of domestic cash generation  versus domestic cash requirements that should benefit its longer-term financial  structure. These steps include: a reduced reliance on CP usage to below $15  billion, a more balanced long-term share repurchase policy including reductions  for material M&A; activity, a more conservative pace of dividend growth, and  using a portion of refranchising proceeds for debt reduction.  CP balances have declined to $13.9 billion at the end of the second quarter of  2016 from a peak of approximately $19 billion as Coca-Cola has committed to  reduce its reliance on this funding source. CP as a percent of total debt is  currently approximately 29%, which compares to peak usage of approximately 50%  of total debt. Fitch expects Coca-Cola will maintain CP balances below $15  billion over the long term compared to a past soft cap of $20 billion.  Supplemental Net Leverage Expected to Decline  For U.S. issuers, Fitch currently excludes foreign cash balances from its  definition of readily available cash used to calculate net leverage metrics.  Fitch recognizes that these cash balances are an asset that may be accessed and  used to reduce debt in the event it is necessary. Therefore, for certain issuers  with significant levels of foreign cash positions, like Coca-Cola, supplemental  adjusted net leverage ratios are used when gauging the level of  tolerance/cushion within the assigned ratings. Foreign cash balances are reduced  by applying a generic 35% tax haircut and a further adjustment capturing  expectations for additional foreign cash balances that could be used for  shareholder-friendly actions. In its calculations, Fitch haircuts after-tax  foreign cash balances by 25% to accommodate for share buybacks.  Fitch expects long-term gross debt, inclusive of CP, to decline during the next  several years with a more balanced capital allocation policy. Supplemental  adjusted EBITDA net leverage for Coca-Cola at the end of the second quarter 2016  was approximately 2.75x compared to 2.3x at the end of 2014. Over the longer  term, Fitch expects supplemental net leverage will decrease to around 2x in  2018/2019 due to debt reduction and EBITDA growth.  Strong Global Brands  As the world's largest global beverage company, Coca-Cola's ratings are  supported by its strong market shares, extensive geographic diversity, strong  distribution platform and valuable brand equity. Coca-Cola has more than 20 $1  billion-plus brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute  Maid, Fanta Orange, Schweppes and Dasani. The strong brands, geographic reach,  market position and diversification afford considerable support to Coca-Cola's  business profile that has led to stable, sustainable cash flows. Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's beverage  portfolio and constituting in excess of 70% of the mix, the ratings consider the  multiyear declines in CSD volumes in the U.S., continued concern over artificial  sweeteners affecting diet CSD demand in North America, risks associated with  excise tax increases and slowing growth in other developing countries. Fitch  believes this risk is mitigated in part by Coca-Cola's market strength in  developing and emerging geographies with greater long-term growth  characteristics driven by low per-capita CSD consumption characteristics,  urbanization, population growth, and expanding middle class that should provide  an important longer-term offset.  Coca-Cola, along with the rest of the beverage industry, have also modified  their price/mix strategy, primarily in developed markets, to focus on both  smaller pack size and premium/alternative packaging to drive a higher price per  unit versus its past volume focus. Consumers are increasingly seeking premium  and smaller-sized offerings as evidenced by the low-double-digit growth rates  within this packaging combination mix.  Underlying Growth Should Improve  Fitch expects underlying revenue growth in 2016 of approximately 3% with volume  growth of 1%, price/mix growth of 2% and foreign currency headwinds of 3%. Fitch  expects underlying operating income growth will increase in 2016 by almost 7%  driven by productivity benefits and organic growth. Coca-Cola's productivity  savings program enables additional financial flexibility over the next several  years to cover incremental investments and costs that will be used in part for  increased media investments and brand support development. Coca-Cola has already  redirected $600 million in previous productivity savings toward increased media  spending and expects to increase spending by up to $200 million-$400 million  more during the next two years.  CCR Ratings:  Fitch does not make a rating distinction between obligations issued by Coca-Cola  Company and Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR), since default risk is very  low at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to  the notes issued by Coca-Cola. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for Coca-Cola include: --Underlying revenue growth of approximately 3% with volume growth approximately  1%, price/mix growth of approximately 2% and foreign currency pressure of 3% in  2016;  --Underlying operating income growth is estimated to increase by almost 7%;  --Coca-Cola generates approximately $10 billion of cash flow from operations  (CFFO) with more than 50% of Coca-Cola's CFFO available for domestic use. Free  cash flow (FCF) in the range of $1.0 to $1.5 billion in 2016;  --Total debt increases as borrowings to fund domestic cash requirements are  expected to moderate;  --Net share repurchases of less than $2.25 billion;  --Capital spending of $2.5 billion;  --Gross leverage of 3.7x and net supplemental leverage of 2.7x.  Over the forecast period through 2019 and once refranchising is complete,  assumptions include:  --Gross margin increasing to the high 60% range;  --Operating margins increasing to the mid 30% range;  --Gross debt levels declining from 2015 of $44.2 billion through proceeds from  asset sales combined with a more balanced capital allocation policy;  --Gross leverage of 3x times and net supplemental leverage reducing to less than  2x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --A public commitment toward a deleveraging policy over the next 12 months. This  commitment would be reflective of achieving a more balanced capital allocation  policy with a pullback in share repurchases and a commitment to reduce gross  debt levels.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include:  --A lack of deleveraging such that gross leverage is sustained above 3x and  supplemental adjusted EBITDA net leverage is sustained above 2x over the  long-term;  --A lack of public commitment to debt reduction;  --A lack of execution with refranchising plans;  --Productivity program does not fully deliver expected cost benefits;  --A more aggressive financial strategy related to dividend, M&A; and share  repurchases. LIQUIDITY Strong Cash Generation, Sizeable Offshore Cash Position  Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to generate considerable CFFO  and FCF. For the LTM period, Coca-Cola generated $9.2 billion and $841 million  (adjusting for dividend payment) of CFFO and FCF, respectively. As of July 1,  2016, Coca-Cola's approximate $32 billion liquidity position consisted of $24.1  billion of cash, short-term investments and marketable securities, and $8.3  billion of availability under its committed credit lines and revolving credit  facility with rolling maturities through 2019. Coca-Cola's long-term debt  maturing in the next 12 months is substantial, totalling $4.9 billion.  Coca-Cola maintains a sizeable offshore cash position due to the company's  substantial international cash generation. Of the $24.1 billion in cash,  short-term investments and marketable securities, the majority was held by  foreign subsidiaries. Foreign cash balances increased during the first quarter  of 2016, when Coca-Cola received $2.4 billion for its ownership interest in  Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. following its acquisition by JAB Holding Company FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Coca-Cola and its subsidiary as follows: The Coca-Cola Company --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Bank credit facilities 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'.

859,KO,Dunkin' partners with Coca-Cola on bottled coffee,"(Reuters) - Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) said on Thursday its doughnut chain will partner with Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) to launch a line of bottled coffee beverages in the United States, its first foray into the ready-to-drink coffee market dominated by rival Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O). The Dunkin’ Donuts chain operator said the beverages, set to launch in early 2017, will be manufactured, distributed and sold by Coca-Cola. The bottled iced coffees, which will include milk and sugar in a variety of flavors, will be sold at supermarkets, convenience stores and in Dunkin’ Donuts shops. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Dunkin’ Brands Chief Executive Nigel Travis told Reuters that the new venture will appeal to existing customers and also build brand recognition.  “Some of our Dunkin’ consumers were drinking other people’s products because we weren’t there,” Travis said.     The cold beverages, like the packaged coffees Dunkin’ Donuts already sells through various retail channels, also are expected to introduce consumers to the chain’s flavor profile. That can help build interest in the brand as it expands into new U.S. markets, Travis said.  Dunkin’ will split net profits from the sales of ready-to-drink coffee sold outside its shops with U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees, with the highest revenue-producing operators receiving the largest percentage of that share. Starbucks, which has sold canned and bottled coffee drinks in North America since 1994, controls about 97 percent of the U.S. ready-to-drink coffee market in a 50-50 partnership with PepsiCo Inc PEP.N. (bit.ly/2dcRuvU) Starbucks reaped more than $2.1 billion from its division that includes packaged drink and coffee sales during the fiscal year ended Sept. 27, 2015.  Travis declined to forecast sales for Dunkin’s ready-to-drink products. Dunkin’ has partnered with Coca-Cola since 2012 to serve Coke beverages at its coffee chains in the United States and certain other countries.

Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), IBM Corp (IBM.N), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Mercedes-Benz (DAIGn.DE) and General Electric Co (GE.N) were also on the Top 10 list, according to Interbrand’s 2016 Best Global Brands report.  Social network Facebook Inc (FB.O), e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN.O) and toy company Lego were the top growing brands. This year, technology and automotive took 29 of 100 rankings on the annual list. The report ranks brands based on financial performance, its influence on customers and its power to command a premium price or drive company sales. Apple’s brand value rose 5 percent from a year ago to $178 billion and Google’s brand value was up 11 percent from a year ago to $133 billion, according to the report.

866,KO,UPDATE 2-Mars Inc buying out Buffett stake in Wrigley,"(Reuters) - The candy maker Mars Inc on Thursday said it would take full control of its Wrigley chewing gum business, acquiring the minority stake held by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).    Mars plans to combine Wrigley with its chocolate business, putting M&Ms;, Snickers, Starburst fruit chews, Doublemint and Extra gum, and Altoids mints under one roof. In 2008, Berkshire invested in Wrigley when it acquired $2.1 billion of preferred stock and $4.4 billion of bonds in connection with privately held Mars’ $23 billion purchase of the chewing gum maker. The bonds were repurchased in 2013, and Berkshire expected Mars to redeem half of the preferred stock, which carries a 5 percent dividend, by early January. Mars will instead redeem all of it. Terms were not disclosed. “I have enjoyed all of Berkshire’s experiences with the Mars family and management and wish them the very best,” Buffett said in a statement. “Both Mars and Berkshire have profited from our investment and that’s the way it should be.” The global confectionery business, worth $183 billion last year according to Euromonitor International, has struggled as more consumers move toward healthier foods, prompting some retailers to reduce shelf space for processed and sugary snacks. “We are grateful for the strong and productive partnership we have with Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway,” Mars Chief Executive Grant Reid said in a statement. “Sole ownership of Wrigley provides us with an opportunity to rethink how we simplify our chocolate and Wrigley businesses.” Mars, the world’s largest candy maker ahead of rivals such as Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and Hershey Co (HSY.N), expects to combine its chocolate and Wrigley businesses during 2017 into Mars Wrigley Confectionery, with about 30,000 employees. The combined business will be based in Chicago, Wrigley’s longtime home, and led by Martin Radvan, Wrigley’s president and a 30-year veteran of Mars. Mars is based in McLean, Virginia.    Known for his taste in less-than-healthy food, Buffett has made Berkshire the largest shareholder of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), and helped Brazil’s 3G Capital take over Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO), which owns Burger King and Tim Hortons. Berkshire also owns See’s Candies. But unwinding the Mars stake will deprive Berkshire of a $105 million annual income stream from the preferred stock. The investment was one of several that Buffett’s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate made during and soon after the financial crisis in brand name companies seeking to shore up their finances, and win the billionaire’s imprimatur. From 2008 to 2011, Berkshire invested well over $20 billion in high-yielding securities from Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Dow Chemical Co DOW.N, General Electric Co (GE.N), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Swiss Re AG (SRENH.S) and Wrigley. But many have been repurchased, forcing Buffett to find other ways to invest Berkshire’s $72.7 billion of cash. He lost $720 million of annual income in June when Kraft Heinz, in which Berkshire still owns a 26.8 percent stake, redeemed preferred stock. The Wrigley notes had thrown off an 11.45 percent coupon.

872,KO,Coca-Cola speeds up efforts to cut sugar in drinks,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, and said it would step up efforts to reduce sugar in its beverages, amid growing pressure from health experts and governments who have blamed sugary drinks for a rise in obesity. The company’s move comes after rival PepsiCo Inc PEP.N announced plans to reduce sugar in its drinks last week. Coca-Cola has over 200 reformulation initiatives underway to reduce added sugar in its drinks and is launching more sugar-free, low- and no-calorie products, Chief Operating Officer James Quincey said on a post-earnings call. The company, which gets about 70 percent of its volume sales from fizzy drinks, is also rolling out Coca-Cola Zero with a “new and improved taste,” he said. Coca-Cola has also been building its non-carbonated drinks portfolio and offloading much of its bottling business to cope with falling demand for carbonated beverages in North America, its biggest market. Volumes of noncarbonated drinks, which include tea, juices and energy drinks, in the region grew 2 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. The world’s largest beverage maker has relied on smaller pack sizes and premium packaging using glass and aluminum to drive margins in developed markets. Total sales in North America rose 3 percent to $2.66 billion. Volume sales of carbonated beverages such as Sprite, Fanta and Coca-Cola Zero rose, while those of Diet Coke fell. Coca-Cola also announced six new franchising agreements with bottlers on Wednesday. (bit.ly/2dJC6DZ) Following these deals, the company would have refranchised territories that account for about 65 percent of total U.S. bottler-delivered distribution volume.  The company aims to refranchise all its North American territories by the end of 2017. Coca-Cola’s net income attributable to shareholders fell 28 percent to $1.05 billion, or 24 cents per share. Excluding items, Coca-Cola earned 49 cents per share. Net operating revenue fell 7 percent to $10.63 billion, the sixth straight quarter of decline.

The company, which bottles and sells Coca-Cola drinks in 28 markets, mostly in Europe, said it is first focused on driving a recovery in some markets that are struggling. “As this happens, we will become more active in M&A;,” Chief Executive Dimitris Lois told reporters, noting that the company would be interested in adding water and juice brands to its business in existing markets. “With regards to geographic expansion, we have said that it’s something we would consider subject to any expansion being in line with our growth aspirations and financially sound,” Lois said, noting, however, that any such moves are not in the bottler’s power, but coordinated by Coca-Cola.

888,KO,Coca-Cola opens new $100 million plant in Cambodia,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) opened a new $100 million facility in Cambodian capital Phnom Penh on Monday to expand its production capacity in the Southeast Asian nation. The plant, situated on a 12-hectare land in a special economic zone on the outskirts of the city, will employ 817 people and it will be powered by solar power, Prime Minister Hun Sen said at the inauguration ceremony. The investment is part of Coca-Cola’s expansion, which began four years ago, said Irial Finan, executive vice president of Coca-Cola. The company began operations in the country in 1993 and the new plant is situated inside the Phnom Penh Special Economic Zone (PPSEZ), a Cambodian-Japanese joint venture and operator of the biggest industrial estate. Hun Sen said Cambodia would have to train more human resources, build necessary infrastructure and supply cheap electricity to respond to rising interest in the country’s industrial and light manufacturing sectors. “This shows that we don’t discriminate against any foreign investments,” Hun Sen said, adding that a new plant by Japan’s Minebea Co (6479.T), a maker of machinery parts and electronics devices, would be open on Wednesday at the PPSEZ.

889,KO,Coke CEO Muhtar Kent hands reins to Quincey in widely expected move,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co said on Friday that Muhtar Kent would step aside as chief executive next year and be replaced by James Quincey, a company veteran credited with several recent changes to help the company cut its dependence on sugary drinks. Quincey’s ascension was widely expected since he became chief operating officer in August 2015 after jobs that included running Coke’s businesses in Europe and Mexico over two decades. Kent, 64, will have completed nine years at the helm when he steps down in May, but he will continue as chairman of the board, a post he has held since 2009, Coke said. Coke’s shares were up 2.6 percent to $42.04 in afternoon trading, making the stock biggest percentage gainer on the Dow Jones industrial average. Quincey, 51, is credited with several changes at Coke including introducing smaller bottles to boost profit and reducing the sugar and calorie content in drinks – initiatives he would continue to focus on, the CEO-designate said on Friday. “The future in terms of the beverage industry in some parts of the world – yes, there’ll be less added sugar, and yes, we think we need to push ahead with the smaller packages and reformulations and innovations,” Quincey said. He said Coke would also concentrate on its sparkling beverage business, push into other drink categories and continue to innovate. Coke still gets about 70 percent of its volume sales from sodas and its sales have fallen in the last three years on sagging demand for sugary drinks, which health experts and governments have blamed for rising obesity levels. Since Kent took over as CEO in July 2008, Coke’s sales have increased by about 39 percent, while the company’s shares have surged 61 percent. Quincey, who joined Coke in 1996, is also credited with streamlining Coke’s bottling operations by merging its three main bottlers in Europe to form Coca-Cola European Partners Plc, now Coke’s largest independent bottler by net revenue. His latest promotion was given a vote of confidence by Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, Coke’s largest shareholder. “I know James and like him, and believe the company has made a smart investment in its future with his selection,” Buffett said in the statement issued by Coke. The CEO announcement comes a day after Coke said Buffett’s son Howard Buffett would retire from its board next year. Some analysts saw the move as potentially paving the way for Buffett’s firm Berkshire Hathaway to sell down its nearly $17 billion stake. “Those counting on an eventual bid some day from 3G Capital and Budweiser for Coke, may think Berkshire Hathaway being out of the picture would make it less awkward for that group to buy Coke,” Susquehanna analyst Pablo Zuanic said in a note. Buffett teamed up with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital last year to buy Kraft and form Kraft Heinz Co. That aside, Wall Street analysts hailed the succession plan. “A move in the right direction as Quincey is a realist with a sense of urgency about diversifying the beverage portfolio and improving local execution via refranchizing,” CLSA analyst Caroline Levy said. Quincey’s background and significant experience in deal making as well as strong understanding and appreciation of the consumer and current trends would accelerate Coke’s growth, Wells Fargo Senior analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a note. His appointment is the second instance of a company elevating its COO to the CEO role in as many weeks. Starbucks Corp said last week that Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson would replace Howard Schultz as CEO.

890,KO,China steel prices fall as demand fears return in volatile trade,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese steel rebar prices fell more than 2 percent, reversing the previous day’s gains, while coke and coking coal remained under pressure on Thursday as concerns about weakening demand returned in volatile end-of-year trading. “The pullback shows traders are not confident about the steel market and future demand during the winter,” said Wang Yilin, steel analyst at Sinosteel Futures. The most-active rebar contract for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange settled down 2.0 percent at 2,951 yuan ($424.35) per ton.  Prices have been seesawing on a daily basis this week amid low turnover with major international exchanges shut for the Christmas holidays and ahead of the New Year. Iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange rose 0.1 percent to settle at 564.5 yuan a ton. Steel mills typically curb their output as the construction industry slows during the quieter winter months and ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday at the end of January. Factory closures due to widespread pollution across northern China last week renewed concerns that consumption of raw materials like iron ore and coking coal may fall harder than is usual for this time of year. The most-active coking coal futures on the Dalian Commodity Exchange were down 1.7 percent at 1,163 yuan per ton, after falling to the lowest since Oct. 18 on Tuesday. Coke fell 2 percent to 1,535 yuan per ton. On Tuesday, prices hit their weakest since Nov. 3.

891,KO,Lawsuit in U.S. says Coca-Cola downplays risks of sugary drinks,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co and the American Beverage Association trade group were sued on Wednesday for allegedly misleading consumers about the health risks from consuming sugary beverages. The nonprofit Praxis Project accused the defendants of downplaying the risks to boost sales, despite scientific evidence linking sugary beverages to obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Praxis accused both defendants of using euphemisms such as “balance” and “calories in, calories out” to mislead consumers, and Coca-Cola, the world’s largest beverage company, of trying to mislead the public into thinking a lack of exercise was the real cause of obesity. “The notion that Coke’s products can be part of a healthy diet is imprinted on the minds of millions if not billions of people, and requires corrective action,” Maia Kats, litigation director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which helped file the lawsuit, said in an interview. Coca-Cola spokesman Kent Landers called the lawsuit “legally and factually meritless. We take our consumers and their health very seriously and have been on a journey to become a more credible and helpful partner in helping consumers manage their sugar consumption.” The American Beverage Association called the lawsuit’s accusations “unfounded.” It also said that, together with its members, it is working with health groups to reduce consumers’ caloric and sugar intake from beverages. Wednesday’s lawsuit seeks to stop misleading marketing and require more consumer warnings, among other remedies. It was filed with the federal court in Oakland, California. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc have pledged to bolster efforts to reduce added sugar in beverages. In October, Coca-Cola Chief Operating Officer James Quincey, slated to succeed Muhtar Kent as chief executive in May, said the Atlanta-based company has more than 200 “reformulation initiatives” toward that end. But according to the complaint, a 16-ounce bottle of Coke has 12 teaspoons of added sugar, a 15.2-ounce bottle of Minute Maid Cranberry Grape Juice drink has 13 teaspoons, and a 20-ounce bottle of Vitaminwater has eight teaspoons. By comparison, the American Heart Association recommends no more than nine teaspoons a day for men, and six for women. A teaspoon of sugar has about 16 calories. Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc is Coca-Cola’s largest shareholder, has said he drinks at least five Cokes a day. The CSPI sued PepsiCo in October over health claims for its Naked juices, but did not target that company in Wednesday’s lawsuit. Kats said PepsiCo “is not promoting itself as a voice of science, or misrepresenting the harms of sugary beverages the way Coca-Cola is.” The case is Praxis Project v Coca-Cola Co et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 17-00016.

896,KO,Exclusive: Top coconut water maker Vita Coco exploring sale - sources,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Vita Coco, the world’s leading brand of coconut water, is exploring a sale of the company that could value it at up to $1 billion, according to sources familiar with the matter.  Vita Coco’s parent company — whose investors include celebrities Madonna and Matthew McConaughey — has hired JP Morgan to advise it on a sale, three sources said. They declined to be identified as the matter is private. Any sale of U.S.-based Vita Coco would come as traditional fizzy drink sales continue to slow and consumers increasingly turn to healthier drinks like coconut water.  The business could attract interest from beverage companies such as PepsiCo PEP.N, Coca-Cola (KO.N) or Dr Pepper Snapple DPS.N, which late last year paid $1.7 billion for anti-oxident drink maker Bai Brands. PepsiCo and Coke are already the No. 2 and 3 producers of coconut water.  Founded in 2004 by two childhood friends in New York, Vita Coco now has sales in 30 countries and is the global leader in coconut water, with 26 percent of a market worth $2.5 billion, according to data tracker Euromonitor International. Extracted from young, green coconuts, coconut water now enjoys prime placement in coolers across North America and Europe and was the world’s fastest-growing cold drink last year, according to Euromonitor, with sales up 19 percent.  “The surging demand for packaged, convenient and enhanced water products is the new engine for the beverages industry,” said Euromonitor analyst Howard Telford. “Energy drinks, ready-to-drink brewed beverages and super-premium juices – most notably, coconut water – were all top global performers.”  Vita Coco and JP Morgan declined to comment on a possible sale. Private investment company Verlinvest, which owns a significant stake in the company, was not immediately available for comment. Verlinvest, the family office of one of the Belgian families related to Anheuser Busch InBev (ABI.BR), took a stake in Vita Coco in 2007.  In 2014, Vita Coco sold a 25 percent stake to the owner of Red Bull China in a deal that brought the drink to the world’s most populous country, and valued its parent company, All Market, at $665 million.   Verlinvest, founded in 1995, manages assets worth more than 1.4 billion euros, in sectors including food and beverages, e-commerce and retail. Its current food and drink investments include Popchips snacks, Le Blon cachaca and Swedish oat drink Oatly. It was an early investor in vitamin water maker Glaceau, which Coca-Cola acquired for $4.1 billion in 2007.

898,KO,Fitch Downgrades Coca-Cola Icecek's Long Term Foreign Currency IDR to 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, February 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded Coca Cola Icecek A.S's  (CCI) Long Term Foreign Currency (FC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior  unsecured rating to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'. The Long-Term Local Currency (LC) IDR is  affirmed at 'BBB'. The IDR Outlooks are Stable.  The downgrade follows the sovereign rating action that resulted in Turkey's Long  Term Foreign Currency (LTFC) IDR being downgraded to 'BB+' from 'BBB-', on 27  January 2017. The Country Ceiling has also been revised to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'.   KEY RATING DRIVERS Foreign Currency Ratings Downgrade The downgrade of CCI's FC IDR and senior unsecured rating results from the  downgrade of Turkey's Country ceiling as CCI's FC ratings are not eligible to be  rated above the country ceiling. While CCI also has a significant international  business (45% of FY15 EBITDA) besides its core Turkish operations (55%), only  one (Kazakhstan, rated BBB, representing 9% of FY15 revenues) of the other  countries in which it operates benefits from a higher sovereign rating than  Turkey.  The ratings of the other countries range between the 'B' (Pakistan, accounting  for 23% of revenues; Iraq) and the 'BB' (Azerbaijan) categories. CCI's FC IDR is  constrained by Turkey's Country Ceiling of 'BBB-', which reflects Fitch's  assessment of transfer and convertibility risk in the country.  Ratings Incorporate Implied TCCC Support: The operational and strategic  relationships between CCI and The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC; A+/Negative), which  owns 20.1% of CCI remain strong. CCI's LC IDR includes a one notch uplift for  strong implied support from TCCC, which includes influence over major decisions,  licensing of strong global brands, price mechanisms that partly protect CCI from  currency fluctuations and marketing expertise. As the fifth largest bottler in  the Coca-Cola system, CCI plays an important role in TCCC's strategy as it  represents an entry point to the fast-growing markets of the Middle East and  Central Asia. Heavy Investments; Stable Credit: Since 2007, CCI has been investing heavily in  capex and M&A; to grow TCCC's franchise in its regions of operations. Due to  strong and growing cash flow from operations, these investments have had limited  adverse effects on CCI's credit metrics. Moreover, CCI's results have shown  resilience to economic cycles and the company's net debt/EBITDA has remained  within 1.5x-2.5x over 2009 - 2015, a level that we do not expect CCI to have  materially exceeded in 2016.  Encouraging 9M16 Performance: Despite weak trading in the summer in Turkey,  which was affected by a contraction of tourism inflow, CCI delivered in 9M16 a  4.1% yoy increase in consolidated net revenue (+8.6% in Turkey; in the  international segment -9.6% in USD terms). Results were achieved on higher  pricing and volumes (9M16: 2.8%: 2015: 1.9%). On a consolidated basis 9M16  EBITDA margin improved to 17.6% (9M15: 17.4%) and should support at least a high  single digit EBITDA growth for 2016 from 2015's TRL1,028 million.   Volumes, Mix Drive Growth: Over the medium-term, once the prospects for the  Turkish economy improve, CCI's performance should continue to benefit from  consistent volume and price per unit case growth, driven by a young population,  low soft drinks penetration in its countries of operations and the ability to  push sales growth, particularly in Turkey, on the more profitable 'immediate  consumption' channel. Forex Exposure and Mitigation: Against a majority of CCI's debt denominated in  dollars and euros at end-September 2016, cash flow remains generated mainly in  Turkish lira and other Middle Eastern and Central Asian currencies. However, we  believe that CCI's credit metrics should recover from the recent TRL  depreciation following counter measures such as raising its sale prices and  scaling down capex.  For 2016, management has announced a scale down of capex and this, together with  benefits from working capital management, has lifted 9M16 free cash flow (FCF)  to TRL531 million from TRL86 million in 9M15. This performance should mitigate  the adverse effect from currency devaluation on leverage. DERIVATION SUMMARY CCI is the fifth-largest bottler in the Coca-Cola system and the highest rated  corporate in Turkey, benefiting from support from TCCC, a conservatively managed  balance sheet and a successful track record of consistent profit growth and of  resilience against past and present macroeconomic challenges. CCI shows strong  credit ratios for the ratings and relative to other Coca-Cola bottlers, with  funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage at between 2.0x and 2.2x and  FFO fixed charge cover above 7.0x. Parent/Subsidiary Linkage is applicable. The Long-Term FC and LC IDRs have been  notched up to reflect the proven support from TCCC. The Country Ceiling  constrains the Long-Term FC IDR at 'BBB-'. No operating environment influence  was in effect for these ratings. No other factors were considered. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: -TL/USD exchange rate at 3.5 at end December 2016, and 3.7 from 2017 onwards;  Turkey volume to grow at low single digits with average selling price (ASP)  rising around 4% for 2016-2019;  -International volume to grow at low single digits combined with decline in ASP  (including foreign currency devaluation) of -6% to 0% per annum for 2016-2019; -Consolidated EBITDA margin at around 15.5% for the period 2016-2019  (2014:15.3%);  -Positive free cash flow (FCF; after dividends) due to lower capex at 7% of net  sales but dividends capped at 35% of distributable net income;  -Minimal M&A; spending. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive  Rating Action As the highest rated corporate in Turkey, an upgrade of the IDRs is unlikely due  to CCI's limited scale, diversification and forex exposure. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative  Rating Action  -A material permanent deterioration in FCF generation or large acquisition  leading to lease-FFO adjusted net debt above 2.5x for an extended period along  with FFO fixed charge coverage below 6x. -A downward revision of the Country Ceiling for Turkey, which would lead to a  downgrade of the sovereign's and CCI's FC IDRs. -Diminishing of CCI's strategic or operational ties with TCCC or geopolitical  developments affecting TCCC's international operations. -Adverse impact of a sharp devaluation of the Turkish lira on the company's  credit metrics not accompanied by adequate cash preservation measures such as  dividend and capex reduction. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity:  Liquidity was supported by unrestricted cash (as defined by  Fitch) of TL811 million at end-2015, approximately USD1.7 billion in undrawn  uncommitted (as typical in Turkey) bank lines, as well as strong relationships  with both local and international banks. CCI's next major maturity is in 2018  when TL1,887.4 million becomes due.

899,KO,Coca-Cola forecasts drop in 2017 profit amid refranchising,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) forecast a surprise drop in full-year profit as costs related to refranchising its U.S. bottling operations are expected to be higher than previously anticipated. The world’s largest beverage maker’s shares fell 3.1 percent to $40.73 in morning trading on Thursday. Coca-Cola has been offloading much of its low-margin bottling business to cope with falling demand for carbonated beverages in North America. It has also been stepping up efforts to reduce sugar in its beverages, amid growing pressure from health experts and governments who have blamed sugary drinks for a rise in obesity. Coca-Cola, like rival PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, has also been building its non-carbonated drinks portfolio. Global volumes of its non-carbonated drinks, which include tea, juices and energy drinks, rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter, while soda volumes fell 2 percent. Costs related to the refranchising of Coca-Cola’s U.S. bottling operations look to be a more meaningful drag on the company’s full-year profit than analysts were expecting, brokerage Cowen & Co said in a note to clients. The company forecast 2017 adjusted earnings to fall 1-4 percent from $1.91 per share in 2016. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $1.97, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company’s shareholders more than halved to $550 million, or 13 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.24 billion, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. The quarter included a $919 million charge related to the refranchising of its bottling operations. Excluding items, the company earned 37 cents per share, in line with estimates. Net operating revenue fell about 6 percent to $9.41 billion, the seventh straight drop, but beat estimates of $9.13 billion, helped by higher sales of its sodas in North America, its biggest market. Volume sales rose 1 percent in North America, including a 1 percent growth in sales of its carbonated sodas such as Sprite and Fanta. However, global volume sales for the company fell 1 percent in the fourth quarter, hurt by high levels of inflation in certain Latin American countries.

903,KO,"UPDATE 2-Berkshire takes huge bite of Apple, boosts airline stakes","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) was an aggressive buyer of stocks in last year’s fourth quarter, nearly quadrupling its stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and increasing its stake sevenfold in the four biggest U.S. airlines. In a regulatory filing, Berkshire reported owning 57.4 million shares of Apple as of Dec. 31, which would now be worth $7.74 billion, up from just from 15.2 million shares in the iPhone maker three months earlier. Berkshire also reported a $9.3 billion airline stake, with investments topping $2.1 billion in each of American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N). It also disclosed new stakes in satellite radio company Sirius XM Holdings Inc (SIRI.O) and seed company Monsanto Co MON.N, which is being bought by Germany’s Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE). Though it is unclear who make which investments, the filing appears to reflect much of the $12 billion of stock that Buffett  said he had bought between the Nov. 8 Presidential election and the end of January. Larger Berkshire investments such as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) are normally Buffett’s, but the 86-year-old billionaire has given his deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler more to invest over the years. Berkshire’s initial investment in Apple got attention last year, given Buffett’s usual aversion to technology companies - apart from IBM - which he considers outside his zone of competence. The new, larger stake makes Berkshire one of Apple’s 10 biggest investors. “I’m stunned to see the size of that Apple position,” said Thomas Russo, who oversees $11 billion of assets, including 12 percent in Berkshire, at Gardner Russo & Gardner in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Berkshire did not respond to a request for comment. The Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns roughly 90 companies such as the BNSF railroad, Geico car insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream. Its Class A shares closed on Tuesday up $2,078.95 at $250,419, a record high closing price and less than 0.2 percentage points below its all-time high on Dec. 14. The plunge into Apple appears particularly well-timed. Shares of Apple closed on Tuesday up $1.73 at $135.02, also a record closing high. Assuming Berkshire has not sold its stake, Apple’s 16.6 percent gain this year would leave it with a $1.1 billion paper profit in 2017 alone. It had been widely believed that Berkshire’s initial investment came from Combs or Weschler. But their decisions have sometimes influenced Buffett, as when Berkshire last year paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, once a Combs investment. “It’s quite possible that Warren woke up and began to understand the virtues of Apple that he had been neglecting or, like with Precision Castparts, Todd or Ted had an affinity for Apple that sparked interest from Warren,” Russo said. Combs and Weschler are the leading candidates to eventually succeed Buffett as Berkshire’s chief investment officer. The airline investments, meanwhile, suggest that Buffett has overcome his two-decade aversion to the sector after an unhappy - though, he has said, profitable - investment in US Air Group. Buffett told talk show host Charlie Rose in an interview last month that it was “in large part” his decision to dive back into airlines. “The industry was once balkanized, but now it is bulking up, and has come to realize that an empty seat is a perishable asset,” Russo said. “More planes are traveling more full.” Shares of American, Delta, Southwest and United, as well as Apple, Monsanto and Sirius, rose in after-hours trading. Such increases often occur when investors perceive that Berkshire has given a company its imprimatur. Monsanto and Sirius did not immediately respond to requests for comment. To make room for new investments, Berkshire appeared to have shed a $1.8 billion stake in agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co (DE.N) and nearly all of what remained from a more than decade-old stake in retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).

907,KO,UPDATE 1-Mexico's Coca-Cola Femsa profit boosted by Central America sales,"(Adds details) Feb 24 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Femsa SAB de CV, the largest Coke bottler in the world, reported a jump in quarterly profit on Friday, helped by higher volume sales in Costa Rica, Nicaragua and the Philippines. The company’s net income attributable to equity holders rose to 3.51 billion Mexican pesos ($178.18 million) in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from 2.69 billion Mexican pesos, a year earlier. The company, a joint venture between Coca-Cola Co and Mexican bottler and retailer Fomento Economico Mexicano (Femsa), said it earned 1.69 Mexican pesos per share, up from 1.30 Mexican pesos per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose to 49.53 billion Mexican pesos from 44.30 billion Mexican pesos. Coca-Cola Femsa said its performance in Central America was driven by Costa Rica and Nicaragua’s highest volume sales growth in the past 10 years. In Mexico, the company said, volume sales rose for sparkling and still beverages. “Our South America division faced the most difficult macroeconomic and consumer environments of our territories,” the company added. Coca-Cola, the world’s largest beverage maker, said this month that global fourth-quarter volume sales fell 1 percent, hurt by high levels of inflation in certain Latin American countries. The Atlanta-based company has been offloading much of its low-margin bottling business to cope with falling demand for carbonated beverages in North America.

908,KO,WRAPUP 4-Warren Buffett rails against fee-hungry Wall Street managers,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett, whose stock picks over several decades have enriched generations of Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) shareholders, delivered a black eye to the investment industry on Saturday, urging ordinary investors to buy plain-vanilla index funds. “When trillions of dollars are managed by Wall Streeters charging high fees, it will usually be the managers who reap outsized profits, not the clients,” Buffett said in his annual letter to shareholders. “Both large and small investors should stick with low-cost index funds,” he added. Buffett, 86, used his investment savvy to build Berkshire into a powerhouse conglomerate and become the world’s second-richest person. Known to fans as “the Oracle of Omaha,” he estimated that the search for outperformance has caused investors to “waste” more than $100 billion over the past decade. On Saturday, he called Vanguard Group founder Jack Bogle “a hero” for his early efforts to popularize index funds. Berkshire itself has done far better, with its stock price gaining 20.8 percent per year since Buffett took over in 1965, dwarfing the Standard & Poor's 500's .SPX 9.7 percent gain, including dividends. Yet Buffett said most stock investors are better off with low-cost index funds than paying higher fees to managers who often underperform. In 2014, Buffett said he plans to put 90 percent of the money he leaves to his wife Astrid when he dies into an S&P; 500 index fund, and 10 percent in government bonds. During the financial crisis, Buffett bet a founder of the asset management company Protege Partners LLC $1 million that a Vanguard S&P; 500 index fund would outperform several groups of hedge funds over years. The index fund is up 85.4 percent, Buffett said, while the hedge fund groups are up between 2.9 percent and 62.8 percent. On Saturday, Buffett said he has “no doubt” he will win the bet. He plans to donate the money to Girls Inc of Omaha. While Buffett said no pension funds or “mega-rich individuals” have taken his advice on index funds and that “human behavior won’t change,” some investors are following his lead. Despite a roaring stock market in the United States, actively managed mutual funds bled $342 billion last year, their second straight year of outflows. Passive index funds and exchange-traded funds, meanwhile, attracted nearly $506 billion of new money. But Tim Armour, CEO of Capital Group Cos, which runs the American Funds and invests $1.4 trillion, said index funds can expose investors to losses when markets turn sour. The funds are one of Berkshire’s biggest investors. “We don’t dispute the data that has led Mr. Buffett and others to form their views,” Armour said in a statement. “However, a fairly simple fact has gotten lost in the debate. Simply put, not all investment managers are average.” Berkshire on Saturday also said fourth-quarter profit rose 15 percent from a year earlier, as gains from investments and derivatives offset lower profit from the BNSF railroad and other units.  Berkshire also owns dozens of stocks including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and the four biggest U.S. airlines, and more than one-fourth of Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O). This year’s letter and Berkshire’s annual report gave no clues about who will succeed Buffett as chief executive officer, a question shareholders and Wall Street have speculated about increasingly in recent years.     But Buffett lavishly praised Berkshire executive Ajit Jain, widely considered a leading CEO candidate, for smoothly running much of the conglomerate’s insurance businesses.     Jain joined Berkshire in 1986, and Buffett put him in charge of National Indemnity’s small, struggling reinsurance operation. Since then, Jain has “created tens of billions of value for Berkshire shareholders. If there were ever to be another Ajit and you could swap me for him, don’t hesitate. Make the trade!” Berkshire, which became one of the top 10 Apple investors in 2016, has gained about $1.6 billion on its Apple investment after shares of the iPhone maker surged. Berkshire’s airline investments suggest that Buffett has overcome his two-decade aversion to the sector after an unhappy - though, he has said, profitable - investment in US Air Group. Buffett, a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton, did not mention U.S. President Donald Trump by name in his letter. But he did, however, talk up the vibrancy of U.S. society and its inclusion of immigrants, one of the most polarizing issues under the Trump administration. And he said the future of American business and markets is bright. “One word sums up our country’s achievements: miraculous,” Buffett said. “From a standing start 240 years ago - a span of time less than triple my days on earth - Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers.”  ",2252017,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-hatha-buffett/wrapup-4-warren-buffett-rails-against-fee-hungry-wall-street-managers-idUSL1N1GA089

912,KO,Corporates break new ground to cope with negative rates,"* Market adapts to ECB effect * Coca-Cola and Pfizer to trigger more supply * Investors guard against political risk By Laura Benitez LONDON, March 3 (IFR) - Coca-Cola and Pfizer broke new ground in the European corporate market this week, pricing the first above par floating-rate notes as the sector adapts to the deeply negative rates sparked by eurozone monetary policy. Coca-Cola priced its FRN on Monday with Pfizer following on Wednesday, in what could trigger a new market trend, bankers say.    “This is the first time we’ve seen an above par pricing on a public corporate deal, and it’s been done by Coca-Cola and Pfizer in a very visible way. It’s a game-changer and it could unlock a reasonable amount of floating-rate supply with above par pricing features,” said Marco Baldini, head of European bond syndicate at Barclays. Pfizer’s €1.25bn two-year floater priced at a cash price of 100.35 with a three-month Euribor plus 20bp coupon floored at a 0%, which rules out investors having to make payments to the issuer. Similarly, Coca-Cola printed a €1.5bn two-year at a cash price of 100.30, with a floored 0% coupon, at three-month Euribor plus 25bp. In October last year, Danone left over €4m on the table when it priced a €1.35bn two-year floater at a margin significantly higher than the market rate required. The French yoghurt maker printed the FRN with a coupon of three-month Euribor plus 15bp, but at a 100 cash price. Given a deeply negative three-month rate, the bond jumped 30 ticks when freed to trade. The securitisation and SSA sectors have long adapted to the complexities created by negative rates, pricing bonds at a premium to par to prevent borrowers losing out. “[The corporate market] has been completely untested,” a lead on the Coca-Cola deal said. “Feedback from lots of accounts has previously been negative when faced with above par pricing. But sentiment has completely changed recently, driven partly by the complete lack of regular supply and investors focusing on the shorter end.” Despite Coca-Cola and Pfizer’s 0% floored coupons offering little if any return at all, demand for the paper sky-rocketed, demonstrating how investors are shielding their portfolios ahead of looming political risk. Investors threw €3.75bn of orders at Pfizer’s €1.25bn floater, while Coca-Cola’s €1.5bn drew a whopping €4bn of demand. “Investors are seeing floaters as super-defensive instruments to put money in, considering the political uncertainly in Europe right now. We’re seeing a number of accounts voicing their concerns around this risk, and floaters are attractive investments,” Baldini said. Mounting concerns over political risk, namely the French presidential election, and poor valuations have began to weigh on investors’ minds, forcing many to ‘park cash’ in safer assets until the market finds some clarity. Cross-border borrowers have flooded the European market in recent years, attracted not just by the low coupons but also the diversification and off-the-run tenors it can offer. Pfizer, rated, A1/AA, returned to the market this week after an eight-year absence to raise €4bn across two, three, five and 10-year tranches. The deal’s proceeds will be used partly to repay the approximately US$6.6bn of commercial paper the borrower has outstanding. Coca-Cola, rated Aa3/AA- (stable/negative) printed a €2.5bn three-tranche transaction across two, four and seven-year tenors, largely to refinance a €2bn bond maturing in March this year.

918,KO,Fitch Affirms Coca-Cola's IDRs at 'A+/F1'; Outlook Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings  (IDRs) and debt ratings of The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its  subsidiaries at 'A+/F1'. The Rating Outlook is Negative. Coca-Cola had  approximately $45.7 billion of debt as of Dec. 31, 2016. A complete list of  rating actions follows at the end of this release. The Negative Outlook reflects Coca-Cola's elevated leverage (on both a gross and  supplemental net leverage basis) which is high for the current ratings. To  stabilize the Outlook, Fitch would need to see a public commitment that  Coca-Cola will adhere to a more balanced capital allocation strategy, with clear  visibility and traction on gross leverage declining below 3x and supplemental  net leverage (as calculated by Fitch) below 2x through a reduction in share  repurchases and gross debt reduction. Following its press release of Feb. 23, 2017, Fitch has reviewed its previous  intention to withdraw rating coverage of Coca-Cola and opted to continue  coverage until further notice. KEY RATING DRIVERS Potential for Leverage Reduction on Debt Paydown Fitch believes Coca-Cola should make substantial progress in the next few years  toward reducing leverage and adhering to a more balanced capital allocation  strategy that would yield improvement to the company's long-term capital  structure as it transitions to a franchising model. Fitch believes Coca-Cola  would benefit materially from corporate tax reform that could provide  significant flexibility for the company to repatriate overseas cash and  accelerate gross debt repayment. Coca-Cola's gross leverage was 3.6x on a total debt-to-operating EBITDA basis at  the end of 2016, an increase from 3.4x at the end of 2015. Its supplemental net  leverage was approximately 2.7x for 2016, which was comparable to 2015. Fitch  anticipates Coca-Cola will reduce debt in 2017 primarily through refranchising  proceeds that would decrease supplemental net leverage to the mid-2.0x range.  Over the longer term, Fitch expects supplemental net leverage could decrease to  around 2x or less by 2019 due to EBITDA growth and to deploy FCF towards debt  reduction.  Commercial paper (CP) balances were $12.5 billion at the end of 2016 from a peak  of approximately $19 billion as Coca-Cola has reduced its reliance on this  funding source. CP as a percent of total debt is approximately 27%, which  compares to peak usage of approximately 50% of total debt.  Long-Term Business Model Should Strengthen Fitch believes Coca-Cola's long-term business model will strengthen as a result  of refranchising plans. While refranchising will cause some near-term EBITDA  declines through 2018, the company will receive upfront cash proceeds that are  projected to be used for debt reduction and an annuity stream related to  bottling assets to offset this decline. Over time, the refranchising will  substantially reduce SG&A; costs, increase gross margins to the upper 60% range,  lead to operating margins that will improve to the approximate mid-30% range  from approximately 24%, and significantly reduce capex intensity.  Consequently, with the expected completion of refranchising in late 2017 to  early 2018, Coca-Cola's underlying cash flows should be more stable, providing  greater support to its longer-term credit profile. Refranchising benefits are  weighed against any challenges with the newly franchised bottlers maintaining a  consistent and unified long-term vision, particularly around future investment  requirements. Productivity Benefits  Coca-Cola's $3 billion productivity program to be completed by 2019 also  provides additional benefits to operating profit and cash generation. Through  2016, the productivity program has resulted in approximately $1.7 billion in  savings. While Coca-Cola is using a portion of these savings to support brand  strength by increasing media and R&D; spending, cost reductions should help drive  future growth in operating profit. Thus, Fitch views the company's longer-term  mid-single-digit revenue and high-single-digit profit before tax financial  targets as achievable once emerging and developing markets fully recover. Strong Global Brands  As the world's largest global beverage company, Coca-Cola's ratings are  supported by its strong market shares, extensive geographic diversity, strong  distribution platform and valuable brand equity. Coca-Cola has more than 20 $1  billion-plus brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute  Maid, Fanta Orange, Schweppes and Dasani. The strong brands, geographic reach,  market position and diversification afford considerable support to Coca-Cola's  business profile which has led to stable, sustainable cash flows. Current Headwinds Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's beverage  portfolio, constituting in excess of 70% of the mix, the ratings consider the  multiyear low-single digit declines in CSD volumes in the U.S., continued  concern over artificial sweeteners affecting diet CSD demand in North America,  risks associated with excise tax increases and slowing growth in certain  developing countries. Fitch believes this risk is mitigated in part by  Coca-Cola's market strength in developing and emerging geographies with greater  long-term growth characteristics driven by low per-capita CSD consumption  characteristics, urbanization, population growth, and an expanding middle class  that should provide an important longer-term offset. Coca-Cola, along with the rest of the beverage industry, has also modified their  price/mix strategy, primarily in developed markets, to focus on both smaller  pack size and premium/alternative packaging to drive a higher price per unit  versus its past volume focus. Consumers are increasingly seeking premium and  smaller-sized offerings as evidenced by the higher growth rates within this  packaging combination mix. Coca-Cola has also focused on relaunching Coca-Cola  Zero Sugar, scaling smaller brands like smartwater and Honest Tea globally and  accelerating global reformulations on more than 500 products to reduce sugar  levels. Fitch expects Coca-Cola will explore bolt-on M&A; opportunities to  broaden its beverage portfolio focusing on still beverages. CCR Ratings  Fitch does not make a rating distinction between obligations issued by Coca-Cola  Company and Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR), since default risk is very  low at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to  the notes issued by Coca-Cola. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for the issuer over the 2017 to  2019 timeframe include: --Underlying organic sales growth of approximately 3-4%;  --Coca-Cola generates approximately $10 billion of cash flow from operations  (CFFO) annually with roughly 50% of Coca-Cola's CFFO available for domestic use;  --Gross Margin increasing to at least 67% and operating margins increasing to  the mid 30% range by 2019; --FCF in the range of $1.6 billion +/- 10% for 2017, growing moderately through  2019; --Gross debt reduction of at least $2 billion in 2017 which is dependent on  timing of refranchising proceeds and South African bottling transaction; --Net share repurchases of $2 billion for 2017; --Capital spending of $2.25 billion for 2017, declining to approximately $1.3  billion. --Supplemental net leverage to the mid-2.0x range in 2017 with visibility  towards getting to 2x by 2019 if the company reduces debt by $2 billion annually  and pulls back on share buybacks.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  stabilization of the Rating Outlook include:  --A public commitment toward a deleveraging policy, with strong visibility of  gross leverage declining to 3x and supplemental net leverage declining to 2x  over the next 24-36 months through a pullback in share repurchases and a  commitment to reduce gross debt levels. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include:  --A lack of progress deleveraging such that gross leverage is expect6ed to be  sustained above 3x and supplemental net leverage is sustained above 2x;  --Proceeds from refranchising materially less than expected;  --Productivity program does not fully deliver expected cost benefits;  --A more aggressive financial strategy related to dividend, M&A; and share  repurchases; LIQUIDITY In 2016, Coca-Cola generated CFFO and FCF of $9.5 billion and $0.5 billion  (adjusting for dividend payment), respectively; lower than Fitch's expectations  of $10.1 billion and $1.4 billion due primarily to a higher than expected  pension contribution of $718 million and the negative effects from foreign  exchange. The pension plan funding was 89% at the end of 2016. Coca-Cola  anticipates making pension contributions of $106 million in 2017. Coca-Cola generates substantial overseas cash flows due to its position as the  world's largest non-alcoholic beverage company and has been reluctant in the  past to repatriate foreign earnings given the tax consequences. Accordingly,  foreign cash balances have grown along with debt including larger CP balances to  fund domestic cash requirements for the dividend, U.S. capital investment, share  repurchase program and strategic M&A; activities. As of Dec. 31, 2016, Coca-Cola's approximate $30 billion liquidity position  consisted of $22.2 billion of cash, short-term investments and marketable  securities, and $8.2 billion of availability under its committed credit lines  and revolving credit facility with rolling maturities through 2022. Coca-Cola  maintains a sizeable offshore cash position as a result of the company's  substantial international cash generation. Of the $22.2 billion in cash,  short-term investments and marketable securities, the majority was held by  foreign subsidiaries. Coca-Cola's long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months  pro forma for the debt issuance in early 2017 is approximately $1 billion. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the ratings for The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its  subsidiaries as follows: The Coca-Cola Company --Long-Term IDR at 'A+'; --Bank credit facilities at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'.

Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments - Financial statement adjustments  that depart materially from those contained in the published financial  statements of the relevant rated entity or obligor are disclosed below: --For U.S. issuers, Fitch currently excludes foreign cash balances from its  definition of readily available cash used to calculate net leverage metrics.  Fitch recognizes that these cash balances are an asset that may be accessed and  used to reduce debt in the event it is necessary. Therefore, for certain issuers  with significant levels of foreign cash positions, like Coca-Cola, supplemental  adjusted net leverage ratios are used when gauging the level of  tolerance/cushion within the assigned ratings. Foreign cash balances are reduced  by applying a generic 35% tax haircut and a further adjustment capturing  expectations for additional foreign cash balances that could be used for  shareholder-friendly actions. In its calculations, Fitch then haircuts after-tax  foreign cash balances by 25% to accommodate share buybacks and determine  supplemental net leverage. --Historical and projected EBITDA is adjusted to add back non-cash stock-based  compensation expense and restructuring as reported in financials. --Bottler dividends ($386 million in 2016) added back to EBITDA.

919,KO,Coke and Pepsi get mixed reviews in bid to clean up Brazil sugar supplies,"WASHINGTON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Coca-Cola and PepsiCo’s efforts to stop illegal land seizures by sugar suppliers in Brazil have made progress but Coke has had the greater impact and its competitor needs to do more, a World Bank conference heard this week. The food and beverages giants committed to ‘zero tolerance for land grabs’ and vowed to clean-up their supply chains as part of charity Oxfam’s ‘Behind the brands’ campaign. Coke and PepsiCo were among companies criticized in 2013 for links to land disputes, with Oxfam saying nearly 800 large-scale land deals by foreign investors had taken 33 million hectares - almost the size of Germany - from poor communities since 2000. This prompted anti-poverty campaigners to call for major multinational companies to do more to stop indigenous communities around the world from being forced from their homes. In light of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo’s commitments, Oxfam commissioned John Wilkinson, an agribusiness specialist at Rio de Janeiro’s Federal Rural University, to conduct an independent review of the companies’ efforts in Brazil. He found the two companies’ commitments were “an important step”, according to an Oxfam report of Wilkinson’s findings presented at the World Bank Land and Poverty Conference in Washington D.C. this week. However Wilkinson concluded while Coca-Cola’s investigation program was “comprehensive in scope”, PepsiCo’s approach “requires improvement”. “(This is needed) particularly around its scope, its stakeholder engagement, and disclosure,” he was quoted in the Oxfam report, adding that PepsiCo recognized it needed to go further in Brazil. PepsiCo did not respond to requests for comment while Coca-Cola had no direct comment on the Oxfam report but highlighted the company’s policy to be proactive on human and workplace rights in its supply chain and the communities where it works. Land is critical for smallholder farmers and indigenous people globally but the majority in developing nations lack secure rights despite living or working there for generations. Farmers are particularly vulnerable in developing nations  where governments, keen to encourage private investment, allow investors to buy, lease, or develop land, creating tension. For while state authorities grant official title, in doing so companies may infringe on communities’ customary land rights. “When companies don’t address these conflicts appropriately, they can even lead to violent outcomes like the murder of Berta Cáceres in Honduras,” Oxfam researchers noted, referring to the fatal shooting of the high-profile land campaigner last March. According to the Oxfam report, the companies chose different ways to assess and clean up their supply chains. Coca-Cola conducted a baseline study which looked at land rights as well as forced and child labor. It has committed to conduct 28 such studies by 2020 to create a new database. PepsiCo initially decided to conduct audits which examined land as well as some social, environmental, and human rights issues. The company committed to publish a “summary of critical findings” from each audit. Oxfam researchers Gustavo Ferroni and Chloe Christman said Coke made a “strong effort” in scope and quantity of interviews and explained how to ensure suppliers followed its land policy. But they recommended Coke commit to a public, time-bound plan to show how it will address findings of its baseline study. The report welcomed PepsiCo’s recognition of needing to do more in Brazil but recommended a shift from an audit-based approach to a full assessment of human rights and land risks. The researchers also urged PepsiCo to embark on due diligence on human rights in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia.

921,KO,Warren Buffett adorns Cherry Coke cans in China,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co is putting the likeness of Warren Buffett on Cherry Coke cans in China, hoping to benefit from its biggest shareholder’s popularity in the country. According to its website, Coca-Cola got permission from the billionaire investor to use his image on cans for a limited time, while supplies last. It launched Cherry Coke in China on March 10. Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which Buffett runs, is Coke’s largest investor, with a 9.3 percent stake worth roughly $17 billion. Buffett has many fans in China, which often sends a large contingent to watch him at Berkshire’s annual meetings in Omaha, Nebraska. Last year, Berkshire webcast its meeting for the first time, and provided simultaneous translation only in Mandarin. Buffett has often said he drinks five Cokes a day, and joked that he is “one quarter Coca-Cola” because the beverage accounts for 25 percent of his caloric intake. The 86-year-old told shareholders at Berkshire’s annual meeting last April that he had no evidence he would be more likely to live to 100 if he switched to “water and broccoli.” ",4032017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-coca-cola-buffett/warren-buffett-adorns-cherry-coke-cans-in-china-idUSKBN1752KT

926,KO,"Coca-Cola to cut 1,200 jobs, boosts savings target","(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) said on Tuesday it would cut about 1,200 jobs as the beverage maker expands its savings target amid falling demand for fizzy drinks globally. Shares of the Dow component were up marginally at $43.39. Coca-Cola and rival PepsiCo Inc’s PEP.N soda sales have taken a hit as consumers in North America and Europe increasingly shun sugary drinks. Global soda sales fell 1 percent in the first quarter ended March 31, Coca-Cola said on Tuesday.  The Atlanta-based company said it was increasing its cost-cutting target by $800 million in annualized savings and now expects to save $3.8 billion by 2019. The majority of the additional savings would come from the corporate job reductions, incoming Chief Executive James Quincey said on a post-earnings conference call. The company, which also reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly profit, said it expects to reinvest at least half of the $800 million saved to mainly boost growth in its non-carbonated drink business. “We are not too worried about this quarter’s miss,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi wrote in a note. “The important thing is that KO is raising its cost-saving estimates and we believe there is more to go.” The job cuts would start in the second half of 2017 and carry into 2018, Coca-Cola said. The company also forecast a smaller decline in 2017 adjusted profit than it had previously expected. Coca-Cola said on Tuesday it expects full-year adjusted profit to fall 1-3 percent, compared with the 1-4 percent decline it forecast in February. The company is offloading much of its low-margin bottling business to reduce expenses, but costs associated with the refranchising have been higher than expected, weighing on profit. Coca-Cola said it recorded a charge of $84 million related to the refranchising in North America in the latest quarter. Net income attributable to the company’s shareholders fell 20.3 percent to $1.18 billion, or 27 cents per share, from a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 43 cents per share, missing analysts estimates by a cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

CCBSA also sold a 4 percent stake to Sipho Excellent Madlala, a manager at CCBSA, as part of merger conditions stipulating it should sell 20 percent of Appletiser to a black economic empowerment holding.   Appletiser, a fruit juice based drink, was previously owned by SABMiller which merged its African soft drink operations with Coca-Cola (KO.N) to become the continent’s biggest Coke drinks bottler. The agreement handed 20 brands including Appletiser, whose fruit juice concentrate is sourced from South African producers, to Coke. SABMiller was acquired by the world’s largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), in a $100 billion plus deal last year in one of the largest corporate mergers in history which takes the company into Africa for the first time. The sale of the shares will give a seat on the board of Appletiser to APG and Madlala. Madlala will retain his role in the company following the transaction, CCBSA said.

938,KO,Fitch Rates Coca-Cola's Issuance 'A+'; Outlook Negative,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' rating to The Coca-Cola Company's (Coca-Cola) issuance of 5- and 10-year senior notes. The Rating Outlook is Negative. The notes will be issued by Coca-Cola and will rank equally with the company's senior unsecured obligations. Proceeds will be used to purchase any notes accepted in Coca-Cola's tender offer, pay any consent payments and general corporate purposes. Coca-Cola had approximately $47.4 billion of debt as of March 31, 2017. A complete list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Leverage Reduction Expected Fitch believes Coca-Cola will make substantial progress during the next 2+ years with reducing leverage and adhering to a more balanced capital allocation strategy that should yield material improvements to Coca-Cola's long-term capital structure as the company transitions to a franchising model. Fitch believes Coca-Cola would benefit materially from corporate tax reform that could provide significant flexibility for the company to repatriate overseas cash that could accelerate gross debt repayment. Coca-Cola's gross leverage was 3.9x on a total debt-to-operating EBITDA basis at the end of first quarter 2017, an increase from 3.6x at the end of 2016. Coca-Cola's supplemental net leverage was approximately 2.7x at the end of first quarter 2017, which was comparable to 2015. Fitch anticipates Coca-Cola will reduce debt in 2017 primarily through refranchising proceeds that would decrease expected supplemental net leverage to the mid-2.0x range. Over the longer term, Fitch expects supplemental net leverage will decrease to around 2x or less by 2019 due to debt reduction and EBITDA growth. Commercial paper (CP) balances were $13.7 billion at the end of first quarter 2017 from a peak of approximately $19 billion as Coca-Cola has reduced its reliance on this funding source. CP as a percent of total debt is approximately 27%, which compares to peak usage of approximately 50% of total debt. Long-Term Business Model Should Strengthen Fitch believes Coca-Cola's long-term business model will strengthen as a result of refranchising plans. While refranchising will cause some near-term EBITDA dilution through 2018, the company will receive upfront cash proceeds that will be used for debt reduction and an annuity stream related to bottling assets to offset this decline. Over time, the refranchising will substantially reduce SG&A; costs, increase gross margins to the upper 60% range, lead to operating margins that will improve to the approximate mid-30% range from approximately 24%, and significantly reduce capex intensity. Consequently, with the expected completion of refranchising in late 2017 to early 2018, Coca-Cola's underlying cash flows should be more stable, providing greater support to its longer-term credit profile. Refranchising benefits are weighed against any challenges with the newly franchised bottlers maintaining a consistent and unified long-term vision particularly around future investment requirements. Productivity Benefits Coca-Cola's $3 billion productivity program to be completed by 2019 also provides additional benefits to operating profit and cash generation. Through 2016, the productivity program has resulted in approximately $1.7 billion in savings. While Coca-Cola is using a portion of these savings to support brand strength by increasing media and R&D; spending, cost reductions should help drive future growth in operating profit. Thus, Fitch views Coca-Cola's longer-term mid-single-digit revenue and high-single-digit profit before tax financial targets as achievable once emerging and developing markets fully recover. Strong Global Brands As the world's largest global beverage company, Coca-Cola's ratings are supported by its strong market shares, extensive geographic diversity, strong distribution platform and valuable brand equity. Coca-Cola has more than 20 $1 billion-plus brands, including: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Sprite, Powerade, Minute Maid, Fanta Orange, Schweppes and Dasani. The strong brands, geographic reach, market position and diversification afford considerable support to Coca-Cola's business profile which has led to stable, sustainable cash flows. Current Headwinds Given the prominence of carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in Coca-Cola's beverage portfolio, constituting in excess of 70% of the mix, the ratings consider the multiyear low-single digit declines in CSD volumes in the U.S., continued concern over artificial sweeteners affecting diet CSD demand in North America, risks associated with excise tax increases and slowing growth in certain developing countries. Fitch believes this risk is mitigated in part by Coca-Cola's market strength in developing and emerging geographies with greater long-term growth characteristics driven by low per-capita CSD consumption characteristics, urbanization, population growth, and an expanding middle class that should provide an important longer-term offset. Coca-Cola, along with the rest of the beverage industry, has also modified their price/mix strategy, primarily in developed markets, to focus on both smaller pack size and premium/alternative packaging to drive a higher price per unit versus its past volume focus. Consumers are increasingly seeking premium and smaller-sized offerings as evidenced by the higher growth rates within this packaging combination mix. Coca-Cola has also focused on relaunching Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, scaling smaller brands like smartwater and honest tea globally and accelerating global reformulations on more than 500 products to reduce sugar levels. Fitch expects Coca-Cola will explore bolt-on M&A; opportunities to broaden their beverage portfolio focusing on still beverages. CCR Ratings Fitch does not make a rating distinction between Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) issued obligations, since default risk is very low at this level on the rating scale. CCR's notes are structurally superior to the notes issued by Coca-Cola. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer over the 2017 to 2019 timeframe include: --Underlying organic sales growth of approximately 3-4%; --Coca-Cola generates approximately $10 billion of cash flow from operations (CFFO) with roughly 50% of Coca-Cola's CFFO available for domestic use. --FCF in the range of $1.6 billion +/- 10% for 2017 with moderate growth through 2019; --Gross debt reduction of at least $2 billion in 2017, which is dependent on timing of refranchising proceeds and South African bottling transaction; --Supplemental net leverage to the mid-2.0x range; --Net share repurchases of $2 billion for 2017; --Capital spending of $2.25 billion for 2017, declining to approximately $1.3 billion. Over the forecast period once refranchising is complete, assumptions include: --Gross Margin increasing to at least 67%; --Operating margins increasing to the mid 30% range; --Supplemental leverage net reducing to around 2x or less by 2019. RATING SENSITIVITIES The Negative Outlook reflects Coca-Cola's elevated leverage (on both a gross and supplemental net leverage basis), which is high for the current ratings. To stabilize the Outlook, Fitch would need to see a public commitment that Coca-Cola will adhere to a more balanced capital allocation strategy including a reduction in share repurchases resulting in gross debt reduction. The Outlook stabilization would be contingent upon demonstration of a public commitment toward a deleveraging policy including: clear visibility and traction on gross leverage declining below 3x and supplemental net leverage below 2x as the company transitions to a franchising model, produces at least 3% organic top-line growth with EBITDA improvement through targeted productivity initiatives. This commitment would be reflective of achieving a more balanced capital allocation policy. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative rating action include: --A lack of progress deleveraging such that gross leverage is expect6ed to be sustained above 3x and supplemental net leverage is sustained above 2x beyond 2019; --Proceeds from refranchising materially less than expected; --Productivity program does not fully deliver expected cost benefits; --A more aggressive financial strategy related to dividend, M&A; and share repurchases; --Consecutive years of materially less than expected FCF. LIQUIDITY Coca-Cola's ratings reflect the company's ability to generate considerable CFFO and free cash flow (FCF). For 2017, Coca-Cola generated LTM CFFO and FCF of $8.6 billion and $2.2 billion (adjusting for dividend payment), respectively. The pension plan funding was 89% at the end of 2016. Coca-Cola anticipates making pension contributions of $106 million in 2017. Coca-Cola generates substantial overseas cash flows due to its position as the world's largest non-alcoholic beverage company and has been reluctant in the past to repatriate foreign earnings given the tax consequences. Accordingly, foreign cash balances have grown along with debt including larger CP balances to fund domestic cash requirements for the dividend, U.S. capital investment, share repurchase program and strategic M&A; activities. As of March 31, 2017, Coca-Cola's approximate $33.5 billion liquidity position consisted of $25.2 billion of cash, short-term investments and marketable securities, and $8.3 billion of availability under its committed credit lines and revolving credit facility with rolling maturities through 2022. Coca-Cola maintains a sizeable offshore cash position as a result of the company's substantial international cash generation. Of the $25.2 billion in cash, short-term investments and marketable securities, the majority was held by foreign subsidiaries. Coca-Cola's long-term debt maturing in the next 12 months pro forma for the debt issuance in early 2017 is approximately $1 billion. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates The Coca-Cola Company (Coca-Cola) and its subsidiaries as follows: The Coca-Cola Company --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A+'; --Bank credit facilities 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper 'F1'. Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. and Coca-Cola Refreshments Canada, Ltd. (CCR) --Long-term IDR 'A+'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A+'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

Madison Street Chicago, IL 60602 Secondary Analyst Carla Norfleet Taylor, CFA Senior Director +1-312-368-3195 Committee Chairperson Monica Aggarwal Managing Director, CFA +1-212-908-0282 Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments - Financial statement adjustments that depart materially from those contained in the published financial statements of the relevant rated entity or obligor are disclosed below: --For U.S. issuers, Fitch currently excludes foreign cash balances from its definition of readily available cash used to calculate net leverage metrics. Fitch recognizes that these cash balances are an asset that may be accessed and used to reduce debt in the event it is necessary. Therefore, for certain issuers with significant levels of foreign cash positions, like Coca-Cola, supplemental adjusted net leverage ratios are used when gauging the level of tolerance/cushion within the assigned ratings. Foreign cash balances are reduced by applying a generic 35% tax haircut and a further adjustment capturing expectations for additional foreign cash balances that could be used for shareholder-friendly actions. In its calculations, Fitch then haircuts after-tax foreign cash balances by 25% to accommodate share buybacks and determine supplemental net leverage. --Historical and projected EBITDA is adjusted to add back non-cash stock-based compensation expense and restructuring as reported in financials. --Bottler dividends ($386 million in 2016) added back to EBITDA.

941,KO,'Food revolution': megabrands turn to small start-ups for big ideas,"LONDON (Reuters) - Food and drink megabrands are seeing their sales chewed away by smaller, nimbler, cooler rivals. They can’t beat them - so now they’re joining them.       Nine of the world’s biggest industry players, including Danone (DANO.PA), General Mills (GIS.N), Campbell Soup (CPB.N) and Kellogg (K.N), have launched venture capital units over the past 18 months, a Reuters analysis of the sector shows.  The aim of the strategy, according to interviews with executives, is to buy into - and learn from - the kind of start-up innovation that has become their nemesis, from micro-distilled spirits and cold-pressed juices to kale chips and vegan burgers. Food and drink multinationals spend far less on R&D; than their counterparts in many sectors like tech and healthcare. They have been wrongfooted over the past five years by the shifting habits of consumers who are increasingly shunning established brands in favor of small, independent names they regard as healthier, more authentic and original.  This is forcing the companies to take a leaf out of Silicon Valley’s venture capital playbook - and their success or failure in harnessing promising new trends at a very early stage could help determine how well they adjust to the changing landscape, and whether they ultimately emerge as winners or losers.     “It’s difficult for companies to have the persistence and to replicate the energy and the passion that these early-stage entrepreneurs have,” said John Haugen, head of General Mills’ venture capital arm 301 Inc, adding innovation was extremely tough because of how quickly market trends were changing. “We’re just a year or a little more than that into these investments,” he said of 301, where his team of about 15 sits down twice a month to pass around dozens of samples from start-ups. “For me it’s part of a total long-term growth strategy for our company.”   In the United States - the world’s biggest packaged food market - small “challenger” brands could account for 15 percent of a $464 billion sector in a decade’s time compared with 5 percent now, according to Bernstein Research.  The researchers point to successful upstart brands like Chobani Greek Yogurt, which they say has stolen more than half of General Mills’ market share in yogurt, and Kind Snack Bars which have taken a big bite out of Kellogg’s snack bars.  The nine companies to recently launch venture capital arms also include Hain Celestial (HAIN.O), Tyson Foods (TSN.N) and Pernod Ricard (PERP.PA). Typically, their funds range in size from about $100 million to $150 million.  While it is still early days for them, the experiences of the handful of food and drink firms that have had funds for several years - Nestle (NESN.S), Unilever (ULVR.L), Coca-Cola (KO.N), PepsiCo PEP.N and Diageo (DGE.L)  - could offer some guide to the future. Coca-Cola, for example, has had a mixed record; its investment in Honest Tea was a success, but a fermented soda and a Japanese tea failed to take off in the United States. So far none of the companies’ venture units has delivered a blockbuster brand, but they say a link to the cutting edge is worth the effort. Diageo, the world’s biggest liquor maker, has invested in 14 start-ups through its venture capital arm Distill Ventures, spending about 30 million pounds over the last four years on minority stakes. It points to last year’s purchase of a 20 percent stake in Seedlip - a British start-up that says it produces the world’s first non-alcoholic distilled spirit - as a prime example of how the strategy is making it more adventurous.  “If we’d had our strategic areas written down four years ago - what does Diageo want to go after - nowhere would we have written down, ‘We think there’s a big opportunity for a non-alcoholic spirit’,” said James Ashall, who heads its innovation unit Diageo Futures. “By Distill Ventures provoking our thinking about the space it allows us to stretch into an area that wouldn’t have been naturally in our gift.”  The company also cites learning gained from investments in craft whiskies, as it develops its own brands in that area, which include Roe & Co and Hilhaven Lodge.  More broadly, Diageo says the venture arm is changing its culture. The global corporation now makes its marketing managers pitch for their ad budgets, like the entrepreneurs who present at Distill Ventures’ laid-back office for 20-30 minutes and get an answer on the spot. “It makes our decision-making faster and more exciting,” said Diageo’s chief marketing officer, Syl Saller. Seedlip founder Ben Branson and other food and drink start-ups are reveling in this surge of investment interest.   “Big companies are saying, wait a minute, we used to beat these guys down,” said Branson, a bearded and tattooed ex-marketing executive who grows some Seedlip ingredients - peas and hay - on his farm in eastern England, where he also dabbles in taxidermy and painting.  “Now I think it’s amazing that there is this switch to let’s not beat them, let’s join them.”  The venture capital divisions are not only for delivering returns or swallowing start-ups, executives say, but also to act as an extension of the companies’ research departments.  This is of particular importance in an industry that PwC says accounted for just 3 percent of the $680 billion spent globally on R&D; last year, well behind the computing and electronics, healthcare and autos sectors, which together spent 62 percent. “This is a form of R&D; for us, or access to places where the company isn’t currently participating,” said Simon Burton, who heads Kellogg’s new venture capital arm, Eighteen94 Capital. Its first investment, announced in January, was in California-based Kuli Kuli, which makes snack bars from the moringa plant. There are more in the pipeline, he said.   As the need for innovation has intensified, the strings that were typically attached to venture capital investments across all sectors - notably the right to buy out the business when it gains scale - have started to disappear in food.  Campbell Soup, Kellogg, Unilever and General Mills have largely scrapped such provisions when investing in early-stage brands because they are often a deterrent for start-up entrepreneurs who fear it will cap their fortunes by keeping other bidders away. Campbell’s general counsel, Adam Ciongoli, said flexibility was needed to attract the best and brightest.   “Why would they want to sign up from the get-go with the idea that they’re not going to be able to maximize their economic leverage and their exit?” said Ciongoli, who sits on the investment committee of Acre Venture Partners, which Campbell set up last year to contend with the “revolution going on in food”.  For investors, experimenting with venture capital is worth the relatively small spend, compared with the risk associated with larger M&A; deals, which the companies are also pursuing.  “Something really good might come out of it, so I don’t have a problem with that,” said Alan Custis, head of UK equities at Lazard Asset Management, an investor in Diageo and Unilever. The risk of buying a successful small brand at substantial cost, rather than investing at a very early stage, is that this will rob the target of the very size and independence that made it cool. One oft-cited example is Kashi cereal, an organic food pioneer whose sales tumbled after it was swallowed by Kellogg.  Olivier Garel used to run M&A; for Unilever and now runs Unilever Ventures. He said the consumer goods sector was relatively late to the venture capital game, but was now being motivated by the need to keep up with new technologies including social media, e-commerce and direct-to-consumer selling models. Unilever Ventures has invested in more than three dozen start-ups and says it is in contact with about 2,500. This month it announced a deal leading a $9.2 million funding round for U.S. organic food delivery service Sun Basket.  Augustin Paluel-Marmont, who sold 40 percent of his French cookie company Michel et Augustin to Danone Manifesto Ventures last year, said it was a good time to be a food start-up.  “It is a lot easier today than before to find funds,” he said. “Entrepreneurs are the new rock stars.” ",5242017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-food-investment-insight/food-revolution-megabrands-turn-to-small-start-ups-for-big-ideas-idUSKBN18K18O
942,KO,INSIGHT-'Food revolution': megabrands turn to small start-ups for big ideas,"LONDON (Reuters) - Food and drink megabrands are seeing their sales chewed away by smaller, nimbler, cooler rivals. They can’t beat them - so now they’re joining them.       Nine of the world’s biggest industry players, including Danone (DANO.PA), General Mills (GIS.N), Campbell Soup (CPB.N) and Kellogg (K.N), have launched venture capital units over the past 18 months, a Reuters analysis of the sector shows.  The aim of the strategy, according to interviews with executives, is to buy into - and learn from - the kind of start-up innovation that has become their nemesis, from micro-distilled spirits and cold-pressed juices to kale chips and vegan burgers. Food and drink multinationals spend far less on R&D; than their counterparts in many sectors like tech and healthcare. They have been wrongfooted over the past five years by the shifting habits of consumers who are increasingly shunning established brands in favor of small, independent names they regard as healthier, more authentic and original.  This is forcing the companies to take a leaf out of Silicon Valley’s venture capital playbook - and their success or failure in harnessing promising new trends at a very early stage could help determine how well they adjust to the changing landscape, and whether they ultimately emerge as winners or losers.     “It’s difficult for companies to have the persistence and to replicate the energy and the passion that these early-stage entrepreneurs have,” said John Haugen, head of General Mills’ venture capital arm 301 Inc, adding innovation was extremely tough because of how quickly market trends were changing. “We’re just a year or a little more than that into these investments,” he said of 301, where his team of about 15 sits down twice a month to pass around dozens of samples from start-ups. “For me it’s part of a total long-term growth strategy for our company.”   In the United States - the world’s biggest packaged food market - small “challenger” brands could account for 15 percent of a $464 billion sector in a decade’s time compared with 5 percent now, according to Bernstein Research.  The researchers point to successful upstart brands like Chobani Greek Yogurt, which they say has stolen more than half of General Mills’ market share in yogurt, and Kind Snack Bars which have taken a big bite out of Kellogg’s snack bars.  The nine companies to recently launch venture capital arms also include Hain Celestial (HAIN.O), Tyson Foods (TSN.N) and Pernod Ricard (PERP.PA). Typically, their funds range in size from about $100 million to $150 million.  While it is still early days for them, the experiences of the handful of food and drink firms that have had funds for several years - Nestle (NESN.S), Unilever (ULVR.L), Coca-Cola (KO.N), PepsiCo PEP.N and Diageo (DGE.L)  - could offer some guide to the future. Coca-Cola, for example, has had a mixed record; its investment in Honest Tea was a success, but a fermented soda and a Japanese tea failed to take off in the United States. So far none of the companies’ venture units has delivered a blockbuster brand, but they say a link to the cutting edge is worth the effort. Diageo, the world’s biggest liquor maker, has invested in 14 start-ups through its venture capital arm Distill Ventures, spending about 30 million pounds over the last four years on minority stakes. It points to last year’s purchase of a 20 percent stake in Seedlip - a British start-up that says it produces the world’s first non-alcoholic distilled spirit - as a prime example of how the strategy is making it more adventurous.  “If we’d had our strategic areas written down four years ago - what does Diageo want to go after - nowhere would we have written down, ‘We think there’s a big opportunity for a non-alcoholic spirit’,” said James Ashall, who heads its innovation unit Diageo Futures. “By Distill Ventures provoking our thinking about the space it allows us to stretch into an area that wouldn’t have been naturally in our gift.”  The company also cites learning gained from investments in craft whiskies, as it develops its own brands in that area, which include Roe & Co and Hilhaven Lodge.

943,KO,"Coke, Cargill enter fray as sugar dispute threatens Mexico trade","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Soda giant Coca-Cola Co and major corn syrup makers have joined the political battle against the U.S. sugar industry in recent weeks, as the deadline to hammer out a years-long trade dispute with Mexico nears. Representatives from Coca-Cola (KO.N), corn syrup makers Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) and Cargill Inc [CARG.UL], and others met on May 10 with White House official Ray Starling, special assistant to the president for agriculture, trade and food assistance, said a number of people who attended the meeting and some of the companies involved.  They warned against potential fall-out for their industries if the United States and Mexico cannot agree to a new trade pact and avert large duties on U.S. sugar imports from Mexico. The deadline for an agreement is Monday. For sugar buyers like Coca-Cola, a failure to come to a new agreement could disrupt supplies and drive up prices. The United States does not produce enough sugar for all its needs and relies on imports to fill the shortfall. For U.S. corn syrup makers, the escalating tensions put them under threat of a trade war with their largest foreign market. The two countries have been embroiled in the dispute for three years. Talks between U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and Mexico, which began in March, are seen as a precursor to more complex discussions over NAFTA. Under NAFTA, Mexico had free access to the U.S. sugar market, but U.S. sugar refiners accused it of dumping subsidized sugar, undercutting their business. In retaliation, the United States slapped large duties on the Mexican sweetener, but a 2014 agreement suspended the tariffs in return for quotas and price floors for Mexican sugar.   The U.S. sugar industry has said the 2014 deal failed to control Mexican dumping and wants Washington to impose much stricter rules. The sugar industry is known for its sway in Washington, especially the politically-connected Fanjul family. But its point of view on Mexican imports is not shared by sugar users such as confectioners and soda-makers. The May meeting was held to emphasize that failure to reach a deal could threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs in sugar-using industries, said Bill O’Connor of the Sweetener Users Association, who attended the meeting. If a deal is not reached, and the U.S. imposes tariffs, Mexico has threatened retaliation, with corn syrup seen as a likely target. U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico totaled $18 billion last year, according to the U.S. Trade Representative. Mexico bought over 80 percent of U.S. fructose, or corn syrup, exports, government data show. “From our perspective, if we meet our sugar import needs from elsewhere, we don’t gain any jobs, but if we lose our corn syrup market in Mexico – that’s irreplaceable,” said John Bode, head of the Corn Refiners Association, who also attended the meeting. For Coca-Cola, an agreement is needed “so that we can continue to expand the range of affordable food and beverage choices available to consumers,” Kate Rumbaugh, Vice President of Government Relations for Coca-Cola North America, said in an emailed statement to Reuters. The company confirmed it attended the meeting. A spokesman for Cargill also confirmed attendance. ADM declined to comment. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.  Lobbying from America’s farm belt has intensified to combat “Big Sugar” as the deadline draws near, said two sources familiar with the discussions. A coalition of Iowa farming groups representing corn, soybean, pork and cattle industries recently wrote to Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, saying agricultural exports are “in peril”. The U.S. sugar industry has said traditional cane refiners like ASR, the maker of Domino Sugar owned by the Fanjuls, and Imperial Sugar, owned by commodities firm Louis Dreyfus Co  [AKIRAU.UL], are being starved of supplies because Mexico is exporting too much refined product.  Recent talks have centered on higher prices and ensuring that raw sugar reaches those types of cane refiners, the sources said. Critics say those terms would drive up prices and limit domestic competition. Phillip Hayes, a spokesman for the American Sugar Alliance, rejected the assertion and said: “Mexico’s predatory trade practices have grossly distorted the domestic sugar market.”  ",6042017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-sugar-industry/coke-cargill-enter-fray-as-sugar-dispute-threatens-mexico-trade-idUSKBN18V138

949,KO,UPDATE 3-Buffett's company to become Bank of America's top shareholder,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s company will become the biggest shareholder in Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), after Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Friday invoked its right to acquire 700 million shares of the second-largest U.S. bank. Berkshire will take a roughly 7 percent ownership stake, worth about $17 billion based on Bank of America’s closing price of $24.32 on Thursday. The transaction will make Bank of America one of Berkshire’s largest equity investments, joining Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), the nation’s third-largest bank. It was made possible by Bank of America’s June 28 decision to boost its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share from 7.5 cents, after passing the Federal Reserve’s latest “stress test” of its capacity to weather difficult markets. Shares of Bank of America were up 16 cents at $24.48 in early trading on Friday. Berkshire will exercise warrants to acquire the 700 million common shares when Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America increases its dividend, expected in the third quarter. It will swap the $5 billion of Bank of America preferred shares it bought in August 2011 for the common stock, in a cash-free exchange. Berkshire is sitting on a roughly $12 billion paper profit, because Bank of America’s stock price is more than triple the $7.14 exercise price for the warrants. After the swap is completed, Buffett will begin collecting $336 million of annual dividends, more than the $300 million he gets from the preferred shares, which have a 6 percent dividend. Berkshire is also the largest shareholder in Wells Fargo, which sends Buffett close to $800 million of annual dividends. The billionaire investor’s Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate also owns more than 90 businesses such as the Geico car insurer, Dairy Queen ice cream and BNSF railroad. Brian Moynihan, Bank of America’s chief executive, accepted Buffett’s investment when many investors worried whether the lender would have enough capital. The bank was only about midway through a multi-year process to clean up its balance sheet, litigation and regulatory probes, largely from its purchases of Countrywide Financial Corp and Merrill Lynch & Co. That process cost more than $70 billion. Buffett has often praised Moynihan’s leadership, telling CNBC in September 2015 that Moynihan resuscitated a bank that had been a “terrible mess.” Bank of America’s current largest shareholder is Vanguard Group, whose 652.4 million shares give it a 6.6 percent stake, Reuters data show.

950,KO,Fitch Upgrades Coca-Cola Icecek's Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR to 'BBB'; Outlook Stable,"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON/MILAN, July 06 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded Coca-Cola Icecek A.S's (CCI) Long-Term Foreign-Currency (FC) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'. The Long-Term Local-Currency (LC) IDR is affirmed at 'BBB'. The Outlooks on the FC and LC IDRs are Stable. The upgrade of the FC IDR and senior unsecured rating to 'BBB' reflects the strong implied and proven support of The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) ('A+'/Negative). CCI enjoys a strong operational and strategic relationship with TCCC, which owns 20.1% of CCI and exercises a large degree of influence over major decisions. In the absence of a formal guarantee from TCCC we believe that CCI could rely on TCCC regarding other financial support in case of need. Consequently, Fitch assesses transfer and convertibility risk as low in line with Fitch's ratings criteria, ""Rating Non-Financial Corporates above the Country Ceiling"", dated February 2017. The 'BBB' IDRs reflect CCI's solid industry operating profile, the quality of its brand portfolio, growth capability in Turkey and the Middle East, and its consistent history of pricing power and profit margin stability through various economic cycles. We expect CCI to maintain a conservative balance sheet with FFO adjusted leverage trending to 3.0x to mitigate the inherent profit/debt mismatch by currency, and its exposure to geopolitical events. KEY RATING DRIVERS Resilient Business Model: Fitch Ratings expect CCI's revenue to grow to TRY9.0 billion by 2018 with margins remaining relatively stable at around 14.8%, which compares to an average of 15.4% since 2003. As the fifth-largest bottler for TCCC, CCI's strong brands and relative pricing power lead to resilience against economic downturns and political instability. Growth stems from its high brand awareness, changing consumer tastes, increasing middle-class incomes, favourable demographics and growing economies. Strong Implied Support: CCI has a strong operational and strategic relationship with TCCC, which owns 20.1% of CCI and exercises considerable influence over major decisions. Moreover in the absence of a formal guarantee from TCCC we believe that CCI could rely on TCCC regarding other financial support in case of need. Fitch assesses transfer and convertibility risk as low due to the strong implied support from TCCC considering its past record of support for CCI and its other bottlers, especially in less developed economies. Consumer Health Trend: Health and wellness trends have resulted in a structural shift away from consumption of sugar sparkling soft drinks. CCI is experiencing a contraction in the volume of sparkling beverages in its core market (Turkey), where sales decreased by 2% in 2016. In contrast, the consumption of still beverages, which altogether represented 29% of 2016 group sales, increased in Turkey by 7% in 2016, an underlying trend which we expect will continue. Fitch expects CCI to address such changes in consumer preferences through innovation in its portfolio in favour of healthier alternatives, and focusing on smaller packaging sizes. Geopolitical Events Limit Growth: Factors that constrain the rating are the events and instability that can hinder what would otherwise be strong top-line growth in its key markets. However, CCI continues to demonstrate its ability to operate under challenging conditions, consistently achieving double-digit revenue growth since 2003, apart from in 2016. We currently assume double-digit sales growth in 2017 partly driven by inflation, and high single digit sales expansion in 2018. Stable Cash-Flow Generation:  FFO margin has averaged 13% over the past five years and Fitch expects it to remain steady, demonstrating the stability of the underlying business model. Over the past five years, CCI generated TRY3.9 billion in cash flow from operations and has adjusted its capex and dividends through the cycle, spending TRY3.0 billion on capex (of which about two thirds is growth) and TRY355 million in dividends. We expect its FCF margin to average 4.8% to 2018. Deleveraging Capacity: We expect FFO adjusted net leverage to fall to around 1.6x by 2018 (gross leverage below 2.5x), partly resulting from expected debt repayments but also profit expansion, demonstrating its deleveraging capacity. In our base case projections we assume that dividends are maintained at a steady payout of 35%. We do not factor in any major acquisitions. Therefore we expect CCI to build up its financial headroom under the current rating over the rating horizon. Management's target is to maintain net debt:EBITDA below 2.0x, which we believe is achievable. DERIVATION SUMMARY CCI is the fifth-largest bottler in the Coca-Cola system and the highest-rated corporate in Turkey, benefiting from support from TCCC, a conservatively managed balance sheet and a record of consistent profit growth and of resilience against past and present macroeconomic challenges. CCI has strong credit ratios for the ratings and relative to other Coca-Cola bottlers, with funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage at 2.3x and FFO fixed charge cover of 6.1x at 2016. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: -USD/TRY exchange rate at 3.7 at end December 2017, and 3.9 from 2018 onwards; -Turkish volumes to grow in the low single digits with the average selling price (ASP) rising at average of 6% for  2017 and  2018; -international volumes to grow in the low single digits combined with an increase in the ASP (including foreign-currency depreciation) of 1.5%-2.0% per annum for 2017-2020; -consolidated EBITDA margin at around 14.8% for the period 2017-2020 (2016:15.5%); -positive free cash flow (FCF after dividends) after capex at 8.5% of net sales (50% maintenance) but dividends capped at 35% of distributable net income; -minimal M&A; spending. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - As the highest-rated corporate in Turkey, an upgrade of the IDRs is unlikely due to CCI's limited scale, diversification and forex exposure Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action For the LC IDR - A material permanent deterioration in FCF generation or large acquisition leading to FFO adjusted net leverage above 2.5x for an extended period along with FFO fixed charge coverage below 6x - Diminishing of CCI's strategic or operational ties with TCCC or geopolitical developments affecting TCCC's international operations - Adverse impact of a sharp devaluation of the Turkish lira on the company's credit metrics not accompanied by adequate cash preservation measures such as dividend and capex reduction For the FC IDR - A downward revision of the Country Ceiling for Turkey, which would lead to a downgrade of the sovereign's and CCI's FC IDRs LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: Liquidity was supported by unrestricted cash (as defined by Fitch) of TRY1,286 million at end-2016, approximately USD 1.3 billion in undrawn uncommitted (as typical in Turkey) bank lines, as well as strong relationship with both local and international banks. Liquidity is supported by our expectation of positive FCF (forecast above TRY300 million per annum post dividends). CCI's next major debt maturity is in 2018 when TRY1,887 million becomes due.

952,KO,Coke Femsa loses key Brazil distribution deal; shares slump,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s Coca-Cola Femsa (KOFL.MX), the world’s largest Coke bottler, said on Monday it is poised to lose a key distribution contract in Brazil, sending its shares down 5 percent, even as it reported an 11.5 percent jump in quarterly net profit.   Coke Femsa said Dutch brewer Heineken (HEIN.AS), which holds a stake in its parent company Femsa, had told the company it would end its distribution of products with bottlers of the Coca-Cola system in Brazil from Oct. 31. Shares in Coke Femsa slumped 5.25 percent to 151.71 pesos as of 1 p.m. local time, and were the biggest drag on Mexico’s benchmark stock index. It was not clear exactly when the distribution contract with Heineken will end, said Hector Trevino, chief financial officer at Coca-Cola Femsa. Heineken maintains the contract can be terminated with six months’ notice, but Coke Femsa disagrees, Trevino said. “We firmly believe that the contract terminates in 2022,” he said.  Heineken acquired the Brazilian breweries of Japan’s Kirin Holdings Co Ltd (2503.T) earlier this year. The Dutch company will use Kirin Brazil’s distribution routes to bring Heineken products to market in the region going forward, Heineken spokesman John-Paul Schuirink said in a statement. “As Heineken, Femsa and the Brazilian Coca-Cola bottlers are still in discussions we are not commenting in more detail,” Schuirink said. The loss of the contract represents a blow to Coke Femsa, said Vector Casa de Bolsa analyst Antonio Montañez, who estimates that beer distribution represents about 5 percent of the company’s revenue in Brazil. Nevertheless, Coke Femsa expressed confidence for its prospects in Brazil as inflation eases. Sales volumes in Brazil increased in June after more than a year of monthly declines, Trevino said. “We have hit the bottom, and from here on, we will see better performance in Brazil,” he said.      Negative currency fluctuations in Venezuela and higher interest rates in Mexico took a toll on Coke Femsa’s results, Credit Suisse wrote in a note to investors. Saying it expected the shares to react negatively, Credit Suisse described the performance in Mexico and South America as weak and also saw the Heineken announcement as negative. The company said net income was 2.232 billion pesos ($123 million) compared with 2.001 billion pesos in the same quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter at Coke Femsa rose 25.5 percent to 50.1 billion pesos. It earned 1.07 pesos per share, the company said.

955,KO,Coca-Cola to sell Coke Zero Sugar in U.S.; profit beats,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) said it would replace Coke Zero with a new sugar-free drink in the United States next month, as the company sharpens its focus on low and no-sugar versions of its sodas that helped best quarterly profit estimates. The new drink, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, is already available in Europe, Middle East & Africa and Latin America, where it grew    in double digits in the second quarter ended June 30. The company said the look and taste of Coke Zero Sugar will be closer to the original Coca-Cola. “It is a reinvention of Coke Zero... it is about helping the zero-calorie part of the portfolio grow,” Chief Executive James Quincey, who took over in May, said on a conference call. Coca-Cola, like rival PepsiCo Inc PEP.N, has been stepping up efforts to reduce sugar in its beverages and building its non-carbonated drinks portfolio as consumers look for healthier options. Volume sales of low and no-calorie soda drinks rose in the mid-single digits in the second quarter.  While Coca-Cola’s net revenue declined 16 percent in the quarter, as the company sells off its low-margin bottling operations, revenue from its core beverage business, or organic revenue, rose 3 percent, indicating strength in demand. “Organic revenue growth in sparkling soft drinks was led by innovation in and marketing support for our low- and no-sugar options like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar,” Quincey said in a statement. Organic revenue was also boosted by higher unit sales of its mini-cans and small bottles, which have gained in popularity even as king-sized bottles fall out of favor. There was some concern that Coca-Cola’s organic revenue growth would be weak in the quarter, based on scanner data that showed weak beverage sales at convenience stores and PepsiCo reporting flat volume sales in North America for the quarter, JP Morgan analyst Andrea Teixeira said in a note.      Coca-Cola said demand also rose for its non-aerated drinks such as innocent juice and smoothies in Europe. Net income attributable to Coca-Cola’s shareholders fell 60.2 percent to $1.37 billion, or 32 cents per share.  Coca-Cola incurred a charge of $653 million related to refranchising its North America bottling operations. Excluding items, Coca-Cola earned 59 cents per share, beating the average analysts’ estimate of 57 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell to $9.70 billion but beat the average analysts’ estimate of $9.65 billion.  Coca-Cola’s shares were up about 1 pct at $45.58 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.

964,KO,UPDATE 2-Drinks bottler Coke HBC's shares soar after sales surprise,"(Adds details) By Martinne Geller LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Soft drink bottler Coca-Cola HBC reported higher-than-expected first-half sales on Thursday, helped by price increases, sending its shares up more than 8 percent to all-time highs. The company, which was the top gainer on London’s FTSE 100 index, said operating profit jumped by nearly 21 percent to 266.4 million euros ($312.5 million) in the first half of the year on sales revenue up 5.6 percent to 3.21 billion euros. Excluding currency fluctuations, sales rose 5.7 percent, beating expectations for growth of 5 percent, according to several analysts. The company, which bottles and sells Coca-Cola drinks in over two dozen countries, sold 1.4 percent more drinks, but the bulk of the sales growth came from price increases and selling a greater proportion of more expensive drinks. The company has raised prices in recent months in countries such as Russia and Nigeria. UBS analysts said the implied growth for the second quarter was 6.1 percent, which was 1.2 percentage points above consensus. They also said the company’s updated guidance implied mid-single-digit upgrades to consensus estimates for the year. “We are on track for broad-based revenue and margin growth for the full year with the organisation energised by the progress we are making towards our 2020 financial targets,” Chief Executive Dimitris Lois said in a statement. The company added that “good volume trends will continue in the second half” with an acceleration in developing markets. At the same time, its price/mix growth should slow in emerging markets and developing markets. The company’s shares were up 8.4 percent to 2572 pence at 0934 GMT on Thursday. They had earlier risen to 2606 pence, their highest level of the company’s four-year tenure on the London Stock Exchange.

966,KO,"Coca-Cola, PespiCo and others agree to cap sugar in drinks in Singapore","SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Seven major drinks companies including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo will limit the sugar content of drinks they sell in Singapore, as part of the city-state’s campaign to fight diabetes. Singapore is one of the first countries in Asia to target sugary drinks, bringing it in line with many Western nations that have sought to mitigate the health risks associated with sugar through measures such as taxes and warning labels. Globally, beverage firms have been reworking recipes, racing to cut sugar and introduced more options to cater to increasingly health-conscious consumers. On Tuesday, Singapore’s ministry of health said the seven firms had signed an industry pledge to remove by 2020 drinks that contain more than 12 percent sugar from their portfolios of sugar-sweetened beverages. As well as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, the companies include F&N; Foods, Malaysia Dairy Industries, Nestle, Pokka [POKKA.UL] and Yeo Hiap Seng. “In addition to this industry commitment, Coca-Cola Singapore is making an additional commitment to reduce the sugar content in our portfolio of sugar-sweetened beverages by 10 percent by 2020,” Coca-Cola said in an email to Reuters. It said it had been reducing sugar and calories across many of its brands, and offering more new drinks with low sugar content or no added sugar. Daily sugar consumption per capita from soft drinks has  risen since 2010 to 6.08 grams in Asia-Pacific in 2016, with Singapore at 11.99 grams, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Consumption has been trending lower in Europe and the United States, but it is still higher than in Asia-Pacific. “Governments in Asia are actively promoting healthy consumption, such as Malaysia which launched its Healthier Choices Logo in April 2017,” said Euromonitor International analyst Nathanael Lim. “Consumers also have an increasing preference for beverages containing natural ingredients with zero sugar.” The World Health Organization said last year drinking fewer calorific sweet drinks was the best way to curb excessive weight and prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes, although fat and salt in processed foods were also to blame. Among Asian countries, the Philippines has slapped levies on sugar-sweetened beverages, while Indonesia and India have been considering similar taxes. Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong mentioned the drinks makers’ agreement in a speech on Sunday, in which he also urged people to drink water, eat wholemeal bread and brown rice, but did provide details.

969,KO,"UPDATE 1-Cereal, drinks companies often overlook risk of forced labor in sugarcane - study","NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Food and beverage companies face the risk of forced labor in countries where they obtain sugarcane but most fall short in efforts to tackle the problem that threatens millions of workers, according to a study released on Tuesday. Most of 10 companies studied offered only limited details of how they assess and monitor risks of forced labor in specific countries, and most of grievance procedures for workers are weak, said KnowTheChain (KTC), a partnership founded by U.S.-based Humanity United. Sugarcane, a major agricultural commodity, can be found in a list of household foods and beverages from cereals to sauces and is often harvested by rural migrant workers with machetes who work long hours for low wages in hazardous conditions. KTC said there is often little law enforcement and those workers are vulnerable to becoming victims of forced labor, especially by recruiters who deceive them about work and wages in other regions or countries. “It is possible that the sugar in the cereal you ate for breakfast or the soda you drank at lunch was produced with forced labor,” said Kilian Moote, KnowTheChain project director, in a statement. “Agricultural workers, particularly migrants, are at most risk of abuse.” Sugarcane produced by forced labor has been found in Bolivia, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Myanmar and Pakistan, according to a list published in 2016 by the U.S. government. Verite, a KTC partner, also found reports of debt bondage of sugarcane workers in India and found sugarcane workers in Guatemala at a high risk of trafficking. Globally, about 21 million people are victims of forced labor, made to work for free after falling into debt or forced to work due to deception, coercion or threat of violence, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO). In Brazil, the world’s largest producer of sugarcane, roughly a half million people work cutting the crop, according to industry statistics. The companies studied were Coca-Cola Co., Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B de C.V (FEMSA), Monster Beverage Corp., PepsiCo Inc., The Hershey Co., Mondelēz International Inc., Nestlé S.A., Archer Daniels Midland Co., Associated British Foods plc plc (ABF) and Wilmar International Ltd. PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, Nestlé and ABF were the only four companies to undertake forced labor risk assessments of sugarcane supply chains in specific countries, the study said. Coca-Cola has committed to conduct 28 country-level studies on child labor, forced labor, and land rights for its sugar supply chains by 2020, it said. Most companies were lacking in revealing details of their risk assessment, monitoring and grievance procedures, it said. “Few companies disclose information explaining how they address forced labor risks in specific countries, and, where they do, the information is typically focused on understanding and assessing risks, with limited information on concrete follow-up steps,” the researchers said. Asked for a response, a Coca-Cola spokesman said the company provided detailed information to KTC. “We believe the report speaks for itself,” a spokesman said, citing Coca-Cola’s policies on human and workplace rights posted on its website. Contacted by email, none of other nine companies responded immediately to requests for comment. The study compared policies and practices and used a questionnaire, to which eight of the 10 companies responded. ADM supplied only limited answers and Monster Beverage, a U.S. maker of energy drinks, did not respond, it said. Coco-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestlé listed the countries they sourced from most, while Hershey, Mondelēz, and Monster Beverage disclosed just one of their sugarcane-sourcing countries, it said. ADM and Monster Beverage disclosed nothing about if or how they monitor working conditions in their sugarcane supply chains, it said.

970,KO,UPDATE 1-Buffett becomes Bank of America's top shareholder,"(Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) has become Bank of America Corp’s (BAC.N) largest shareholder by exercising its right to acquire 700 million shares at a steep discount, more than tripling an investment it made six years ago. Berkshire is now the largest shareholder in the second- and third-largest U.S. banks, with stakes of roughly 6.6 percent in Bank of America and 10 percent in Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), according to Reuters data. It also has an interest in JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), the largest U.S. bank, where Todd Combs, one of Buffett’s deputy portfolio managers, is a director. Bank of America on Tuesday said Berkshire exercised warrants to acquire its shares for roughly $7.14 each, well below their closing price of $23.58, down 14 cents from Monday. The announcement was made after U.S. markets closed. To pay for the shares, Berkshire swapped $5 billion of Bank of America preferred stock it had bought in August 2011. Its new common shares are worth roughly $16.5 billion, giving Berkshire a roughly $11.5 billion paper profit. Berkshire owns more than 90 businesses such as the Geico car insurer, Dairy Queen ice cream and the BNSF railroad. Buffett has run the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate since 1965. The billionaire turns 87 on Wednesday. The swap was made possible by Bank of America’s decision in June to boost its dividend 60 percent, after the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender passed a Federal Reserve “stress test” of its ability to navigate tough markets. It also vindicates Buffett’s confidence in Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan, who accepted his money when the bank was only midway through cleaning up balance sheet and litigation issues tied to the U.S. housing and financial crises. “In 2011, we welcomed Berkshire Hathaway as a shareholder, and we appreciate their continued support now as our largest common shareholder,” Moynihan said in a statement on Tuesday. Berkshire will collect $336 million of annual dividends from Bank of America, more than the $300 million generated by the preferred stock. It also receives close to $800 million of annual dividends from Wells Fargo. Some of Berkshire’s other large equity investments are American Express Co (AXP.N), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O).

971,KO,Fitch Rates Coca-Cola Icecek's Planned Unsecured Eurobond Issue 'BBB(EXP)',"(The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, September 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned Coca-Cola Icecek's (CCI) planned senior notes issue an expected senior unsecured rating of 'BBB(EXP)'. The final rating is contingent upon the receipt of final documents conforming to information already received by Fitch. Proceeds of the notes will be used to refinance the company's 4.75% notes due in 2018. The planned notes will be unguaranteed, ranking equally with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness of the issuer that is not subordinated to the notes, including that under senior credit facilities. The contemplated transaction is leverage neutral and is part of the group's liability management. KEY RATING DRIVERS Resilient Business Model: Fitch expect CCI's revenue to grow to TRY9.0 billion by 2018 with margins remaining relatively stable at around 14.8%, which compares to an average of 15.4% since 2003. As the fifth-largest bottler for TCCC, CCI's strong brands and relative pricing power lead to resilience against economic downturns and political instability. Growth stems from its high brand awareness, changing consumer tastes, increasing middle-class incomes, favourable demographics and growing economies. Strong Implied Support: CCI has a strong operational and strategic relationship with TCCC, which owns 20.1% of CCI and exercises considerable influence over major decisions; it licenses strong global brands to CCI, provides marketing expertise and also has price flexibility in its supply terms that can partly protect profits from currency fluctuations. Moreover in the absence of a formal guarantee from TCCC, we believe that CCI could rely on TCCC regarding other financial support in case of need. Fitch assesses transfer and convertibility risk as low, supported by TCCC's past record of supporting CCI and its other bottlers, especially in less developed economies. This results in a one-notch uplift, applicable to both the Local-Currency (LC) and Foreign-Currency (FC) IDRs from its standalone rating of 'BBB-'. CCI's FC IDR is limited to its LC IDR of 'BBB' and we expect the FC IDR uplift to remain at no more than one-notch from Turkey's country ceiling (currently 'BBB-'). Consumer Health Trend: Health and wellness trends have resulted in a structural shift away from the consumption of sugar sparkling soft drinks. CCI is experiencing a contraction in the volume of sparkling beverages in its core market (Turkey), where sales decreased by 2% in 2016. In contrast, the consumption of still beverages, which altogether represented 29% of 2016 group sales, increased in Turkey by 7% in 2016, an underlying trend which we expect will continue. Fitch expects CCI to address such changes in consumer preferences through innovation in its portfolio in favour of healthier alternatives, and focusing on smaller packaging sizes. Geopolitical Events Limit Growth: CCI continues to demonstrate its ability to operate under challenging conditions, consistently achieving double-digit revenue growth since 2003, apart from in 2016. We currently assume double-digit sales growth in 2017, partly driven by inflation, and high single digit sales expansion in 2018. Stable Cash-Flow Generation: FFO margin has averaged 13% over the past five years and Fitch expects it to remain steady, demonstrating the stability of the underlying business model. Over the past five years, CCI generated TRY3.9 billion in cash flow from operations and has adjusted its capex and dividends through the cycle, spending TRY3.0 billion on capex (of which about two thirds is related to expansion) and TRY355 million in dividends. We expect its FCF margin to average 4.8% to 2018. Deleveraging Capacity: We expect FFO adjusted net leverage to fall to around 1.6x by 2018 (gross leverage below 2.5x), partly resulting from expected debt repayments, but also profit expansion, demonstrating its deleveraging capacity. In our base case projections we assume that dividends are maintained at a steady payout of 35%. We do not factor in any major acquisitions. Therefore, we expect CCI to build up its financial headroom under the current rating over the rating horizon. Management's target is to maintain net debt-EBITDA below 2.0x, which we believe is achievable. DERIVATION SUMMARY Coca-Cola Icecek is the fifth-largest bottler in the Coca Cola system. Compared to the main peers Femsa (A-) and Amatil (BBB+), CCI has smaller size and lower EBITDA margin and operates in markets that require more capex and are vulnerable to volatile demand. On the other side, with funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage at 2.3x and FFO fixed charge cover of 6.1x at 2016, CCI is well positioned in its rating of 'BBB' (which includes a one-notch uplift based on Fitch's parent-subsidiary linkage) and in comparison to other Coca-Cola bottlers. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - USD/TRY exchange rate at 3.7 at end December 2017, and 3.9 from 2018 onwards; - Turkish volumes to grow in the low single digits, with the average selling price (ASP) rising at an average of 6% for  2017 and  2018; - international volumes to grow in the low single digits, combined with an increase in the ASP (including foreign-currency depreciation) of 1.5%-2.0% per annum for 2017-2020; - consolidated EBITDA margin at around 14.8% for the period 2017-2020 (2016:15.5%); - positive free cash flow (FCF after dividends) after capex at 8.5% of net sales (50% maintenance) but dividends capped at 35% of distributable net income; - minimal M&A; spending. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action - As the highest-rated corporate in Turkey, an upgrade of the IDRs is unlikely due to CCI's limited scale, diversification and forex exposure. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action For the LC IDR: - a material permanent deterioration in FCF generation or a large acquisition leading to FFO adjusted net leverage above 2.5x for an extended period, along with FFO fixed charge coverage below 6x; - diminishing of CCI's strategic or operational ties with TCCC, or geopolitical developments affecting TCCC's international operations; or - adverse impact of a sharp devaluation of the Turkish lira on the company's credit metrics, not accompanied by adequate cash preservation measures such as dividend and capex reduction. For the FC IDR: - a downward revision of the Country Ceiling for Turkey, which would lead to a downgrade of the sovereign's and CCI's FC IDRs. LIQUIDITY Solid Liquidity: Liquidity was supported by unrestricted cash (as defined by Fitch) of TRY1,286 million at end-2016, approximately USD1.3 billion in undrawn uncommitted (as is typical in Turkey) bank lines, as well as a strong relationship with both local and international banks. Liquidity is supported by our expectation of positive FCF (forecast above TRY300 million per annum post dividends). The planned issue will add additional comfort to CCI's liquidity profile by shifting major debt maturities.

973,KO,Buffett says success of Trump tax plan may affect stock investments,"Oct 3 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett is closely monitoring whether U.S. President Donald Trump can lower corporate taxes, one of the rare times the billionaire has looked to Washington to help him decide which stocks to buy and sell. “It’s an actual factor at Berkshire,” Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC television. “And it’s very, very, very seldom in my 87 years that it has ever been a factor.” Buffett normally buys stocks for the long term with less focus on tax issues. But when asked if he was thinking about taxes, he said “I think about them plenty” now. “We’ve got actions on both sides that we would take,” referring to taking gains or realizing losses, he said. Berkshire has said it ended June with more than $135 billion of equity investments, which Buffett mainly controls and holds for the long term. The conglomerate is sitting on huge gains in big investments such as American Express Co, Coca-Cola Co and Wells Fargo & Co, while other bets such as International Business Machines Corp have fared less well. Buffett had said at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 6 that he would rather realize losses than take gains if he expected rates to fall. That might be a good strategy now, if Trump and many congressional Republicans succeeded in lowering the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. Buffett explained that he would “feel kind of silly” realizing a $1 billion gain and paying $350 million in taxes, only to have Congress lower the rate and thus his tax bill. He said other investors sitting on “hundreds of billions” of dollars of potential profits might be thinking the same thing. It is unclear whether the Republican-controlled Congress can pass a tax bill that Trump will sign, and Buffett said it has been unable to overhaul the Affordable Care Act or move forward on infrastructure, two of the president’s priorities. He expects to know by year end whether taxes are going down. “I would think the Republicans controlling both houses [of Congress] and the presidency, they would not want to have a shutout, in their first year,” Buffett said. “I think they can get it done.” (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Tom Brown)",10032017,http://www.reuters.com/article/berkshire-hatha-trump-taxation/buffett-says-success-of-trump-tax-plan-may-affect-stock-investments-idUSL2N1ME191

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days. Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision.

Alexander Douglas Jr., who will hand over the reins to Dinkins in Jan. 1, oversaw the company’s refranchising of its U.S. bottling operations in a major cost-cutting initiative.

Dinkins, who is also chief retail sales officer for the North America business, started his career with the company in 1988. Dinkins’ promotion is the first major management change announced under Chief Executive James Quincey, who took over in May from Muhtar Kent. Douglas will retire from the company in March.

983,KO,Coke's North American sales rise fuels market share gains over Pepsi,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) topped profit and revenue estimates for the third quarter on a 3 percent rise in North American sales, gaining market share over arch rival PepsiCo Inc PEP.N as it sold more Sprite, teas and coffees. Over the course of several years, both companies have shifted their strategy, focusing on selling low-calorie versions of their colas and buying healthier beverage brands, as consumers move away from sugary sodas. But Coke seems to be winning the so-called cola-wars by adopting a more aggressive approach to selling juices, teas and vitamin water and taking the lead on franchising its bottling operations to cut costs. “Coca-Cola is clearly gaining share as evidenced by the very wide performance gap between itself and PepsiCo,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi wrote in a note. The company had a 22 percent share of the North American non-alcoholic drinks market last year, ahead of PepsiCo’s 19 percent, according to Euromonitor data. In the third quarter, Coca-Cola’s profit rose 38 percent to $1.45 billion and North America beverage sales rose to $2.75 billion. In contrast, PepsiCo reported a drop in quarterly beverage sales in North America for the first time in two years, hit by weak demand for Gatorade and marketing missteps. Coca-Cola has also reined in costs by refranchising its bottling operations - a move has helped it eliminate costs of operating a low-margin business, and given it a more predictable revenue stream. General and selling expenses were down 20 percent in the third quarter, while cost of goods sold fell 18 percent. Recent acquisitions of non-soda beverages such as salty mineral water brand Topo Chico, Honest Tea and Unilever’s (UNc.AS) AdeS soy-based beverages have increased the options Coca-Cola can offer to consumers. Excluding items, the company earned a profit of 50 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate by a cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue fell 14.6 percent to $9.08 billion due to the refranchising, but beat the average estimate of $8.72 billion. Coca-Cola’s shares, up 11 percent this year, were largely flat on Wednesday.

1007,KO,"Coca-Cola sales beat on strong sales of vitamin water, coffee","(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales on Friday as it sold more teas, coffees and vitamin water, offsetting sluggish sales of fizzy drinks, sending its shares up as much as 2 percent. Coke also said it planned to use cash it held overseas and savings generated from the U.S. corporate tax rate changes to reduce its debt by $7 billion, making it the latest company to take advantage of the new tax law to bolster its balance sheet. For the fourth quarter, however, the company took a $3.6 billion charge related to the tax law, resulting in a net loss compared with a profit a year earlier. Coke and rival PepsiCo (PEP.O) have been struggling with lower sales of their sugary sodas as consumers shift to healthier drinks. Earlier this week, Pepsi also reported weak quarterly sales of sodas and sugary drinks. To stem the decline, Coke relaunched its iconic low-calorie Diet Coke in four new flavors - ginger-lime, feisty cherry, blood orange and twisted mango - earlier this year, and has focused on its non-fizzy beverages such as Georgia coffee and Glaceau vitamin water. Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said the new flavors and packaging were a step in the right direction and that sales of Coke Zero Sugar were picking up following a relaunch. Net operating revenue fell to $7.51 billion from $9.41 billion a year earlier due to ongoing efforts to refranchise its bottling operations, but beat the average analyst estimate of $7.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Global volume growth remained unchanged even as North America volumes increased 1 percent. Wells Fargo analyst Bonnnie Herzog said flat unit case volume growth was a concern but positive momentum in many international markets was encouraging. The Fanta and Diet Coke maker reported a net loss of $2.75 billion, or 65 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, mainly due to a $3.6 billion charge related to the new tax law. A year earlier the company had posted a profit of $550 million, or 13 cents per share.  On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings per share of 39 cents, beating analysts’ average estimate of 38 cents. For 2018, the Coke said it expects organic revenue to grow 4 percent and adjusted earnings per share to grow between 8 and 10 percent.

Net profit in the October-December period was more than 1.83 billion pesos ($93 million), down from nearly 6.7 billion pesos in the same period of 2016.

Higher fuel costs in Mexico, higher labor costs and depreciation in Central America also took a toll on Coke Femsa’s results. Femsa said its retail division, which operates OXXO convenience stores, saw revenues rise 10 percent, but it noted that sales at stores open for at least a year had slowed.

1012,KO,Coca-cola defeats U.S. lawsuit over Diet Coke ads,"(Reuters) - A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit claiming that Coca-Cola Co’s advertising for Diet Coke misleads people into thinking that consuming the soft drink assists in weight loss, and that it actually causes weight gain. The plaintiff, Shana Becerra, claimed that she and others would not have bought Diet Coke, which was launched in 1982, but for the word “diet” and ads such as one showing the soft drink being poured by a bare-chested man with a well-muscled torso. In a decision on Tuesday, however, U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco said 13 studies cited by Becerra were “equivocal” as to whether diet soda causes weight gain, and that she must prove it does to prevail. He also noted that supermarkets do not display Diet Coke in the health food section, and said reasonable consumers would understand that any caloric savings would lead to weight loss only as part of a “sensible diet and exercise regimen” dependent on individual metabolism. “Becerra has overstated the actual science,” Alsup wrote. The judge separately rejected Coca-Cola’s argument that federal law preempted the lawsuit, which sought class-action status. A lawyer for the plaintiff did not immediately respond on Wednesday to a request for comment. Coca-Cola did not immediately respond to a similar request. Becerra, who lives in Santa Rosa, California, claimed that non-nutritive sweeteners such as Diet Coke’s aspartame interfere with the ability to metabolize calories, and raise the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. She sued on behalf of California residents for unspecified damages and an injunction against marketing Diet Coke as “diet.” Coca-Cola relaunched the Diet Coke brand in January to stem falling sales, and added blood orange, cherry, ginger-lime and mango flavors in taller, thinner cans. The case is Becerra v Coca-Cola Co, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 17-05916.

1015,KO,"Coca-Cola, U.S. State Dept to use blockchain to combat forced labor","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and the U.S. State Department along with two other companies said on Friday they are launching a project using blockchain’s digital ledger technology to create a secure registry for workers that will help fight the use of forced labor worldwide. The State Department said this is the government agency’s first major project on this issue using blockchain, reinforcing the technology’s growing application for social causes. According to the International Labor Organization, nearly 25 million people work in forced-labor conditions worldwide, with 47 percent of them in the Asia-Pacific region. Food and beverage companies are under pressure to address the risk of forced labor in countries where they obtain sugarcane. A study released last year by KnowTheChain (KTC), a partnership founded by U.S.-based Humanity United, showed that most food and beverage companies fall short in their efforts to solve the problem.  The study said Coca-Cola, one of 10 global companies looked at by KTC, has committed to conduct 28 country-level studies on child labor, forced labor, and land rights for its sugar supply chains by 2020. The U.S. beverage giant said it has been exploring multiple blockchain projects for more than a year. Brent Wilton, the company’s global head of workplace rights, said in an email to Reuters, “We are partnering with the pilot of this project to further increase transparency and efficiency of the verification process related to labor policies within our supply chain.” The new venture is intended to create a secure registry for workers and their contracts using blockchain’s validation and digital notary capabilities, said Blockchain Trust Accelerator (BTA), a non-profit organization involved in the project. BTA is a global platform for harnessing blockchain to deliver social impact. The State Department said it will provide expertise on labor protection. “The Department of State is excited to work on this innovative blockchain-based pilot,” Deputy Assistant Secretary Scott Busby said in an email to Reuters, noting that while blockchain cannot compel companies or those in authority to abide by the labor contracts, it can create a validated chain of evidence that will encourage compliance with those contracts. The Bitfury Group, a U.S. tech company, will build the blockchain platform for this project, while Emercoin will provide blockchain services as well, Bitfury Chief Executive Valery Vavilov and Emercoin Chief Technology Officer Oleg Khovayko said on Friday.

The firm, a joint venture between Fomento Economico Mexicano (Femsa) and Coca-Cola Co, said it was shuttering operations at its 160-employee distribution center in Ciudad Altamirano in Guerrero state. “The lack of conditions necessary to operate in an efficient and safe way in this area of the state of Guerrero, as well as the recent unwarranted aggression towards one of our workers, led to the company taking this decision,” Coca-Cola Femsa said in a statement.

1021,KO,"As corporate-government tax pacts falter, Coca-Cola challenges huge U.S. bill","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) thought it had a deal with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on how much the company charged foreign affiliates for the rights to make and sell Coke products abroad. Then in September 2015 a letter from the IRS arrived at Coca-Cola’s Atlanta headquarters with a bill for back taxes whose amount, $3.3 billion, stunned the world’s No. 1 soft drinks maker. Coca-Cola sued the IRS, disputing the bill. The case is being tried now in U.S. Tax Court in Washington. A verdict is not expected for some time after the trial ends, expected in mid-April.     The case is being watched closely by tax experts as a sign of rising tension between tax authorities and multinational corporations over transfer pricing, that is, the way companies value the goods, services, trademark and patent rights that they constantly move among foreign units across national boundaries. An important management discipline inside multinationals, transfer pricing is under more scrutiny than ever before from tax agencies worldwide because of strict new global standards, raising legal risks for companies and their investors. The Coca-Cola case goes to trial as interest among corporations in seeking multi-year deals with the IRS covering transfer pricing arrangements has fallen in the past two years. The IRS reported on Friday that it received 101 applications in 2017 for “advance pricing agreements” (APAs), similar to 2016’s level of 98 in 2016, but well below 2015’s peak of 183. APA applications also fell in 2016 in Japan, the top U.S. bilateral APA partner, according to the latest data. Anecdotal evidence suggests the APA process, designed to prevent conflict, is under strain in many countries, with some tax lawyers citing Mexico, Italy and China as challenging.  Corporate tax directors at a conference in Washington earlier this month said APAs are taking longer to negotiate and government tax agencies are less willing to do them. “We’re really living in a different time and we can understand why tax authorities might be reluctant because there’s a lot more external scrutiny than there ever was,” said Amy Roberti, director of global tax and fiscal policy for Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), at the conference. Asked for more details afterward, Roberti said through a company spokeswoman that APAs help Procter & Gamble build “relationships with governments and fiscal authorities.” The IRS did not immediately provide answers to questions about the Coca-Cola case and transfer pricing, in general.  Coca-Cola responded to questions by providing an internal employee memo about the case that said, “The company firmly believes that the IRS’ claims are without merit and will pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies.” The IRS contends that Coca-Cola charged several foreign affiliates royalties that were too low from 2007 to 2009, which reduced the parent company’s U.S. income and resulted in underpayment of its U.S. income taxes by $3.3 billion. Tax agencies often challenge transfer pricing arrangements on the grounds that they are set up to minimize income in high-tax countries and maximize it in low-tax countries. Under a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting framework set up by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2016, one hundred national tax agencies including the IRS expect companies to use an “arm’s length” approach to transfer pricing. That means, in the case of trademark rights, for instance, charging foreign units royalties equal to their open market value. The trouble is that trademarks are usually unique. So approximating their “arm’s length” price is difficult. Coca-Cola says in court filings that the IRS approved the company’s method for setting its transfer prices for the affiliates in a 1996 agreement, but that the IRS later withdrew that approval and issued the bill for back taxes. Coca-Cola did not have an APA with the IRS. Instead, it had an APA-like “audit closing agreement” that dated back to 1996 and was, the company says, reaffirmed in later audits. But much changed in transfer pricing over the more than 20 years since Coca-Cola reached its understanding with the IRS. “It’s an interesting case,” said former IRS Acting Commissioner Steven Miller. “If I were a tax director, I would be thinking about how much I can rely on agreements like this. “It does drive home how important it is not to just assume that an agreement can be relied on forever because apparently, maybe not,” said Miller, now national director of tax at consulting firm Alliantgroup.

Under a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting framework set up by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2016, one hundred national tax agencies including the IRS expect companies to use an “arm’s length” approach to transfer pricing. That means, in the case of trademark rights, for instance, charging foreign units royalties equal to their open market value. The trouble is that trademarks are usually unique. So approximating their “arm’s length” price is difficult. Coca-Cola says in court filings that the IRS approved the company’s method for setting its transfer prices for the affiliates in a 1996 agreement, but that the IRS later withdrew that approval and issued the bill for back taxes. Coca-Cola did not have an APA with the IRS. Instead, it had an APA-like “audit closing agreement” that dated back to 1996 and was, the company says, reaffirmed in later audits. But much changed in transfer pricing over the more than 20 years since Coca-Cola reached its understanding with the IRS. “It’s an interesting case,” said former IRS Acting Commissioner Steven Miller. “If I were a tax director, I would be thinking about how much I can rely on agreements like this. “It does drive home how important it is not to just assume that an agreement can be relied on forever because apparently, maybe not,” said Miller, now national director of tax at consulting firm Alliantgroup.

1023,KO,"RPT-As corporate-government tax pacts falter, Coca-Cola challenges huge US bill","(Repeats to widen readership) By Kevin Drawbaugh WASHINGTON, April 1 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co thought it had a deal with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on how much the company charged foreign affiliates for the rights to make and sell Coke products abroad. Then in September 2015 a letter from the IRS arrived at Coca-Cola’s Atlanta headquarters with a bill for back taxes whose amount, $3.3 billion, stunned the world’s No. 1 soft drinks maker. Coca-Cola sued the IRS, disputing the bill. The case is being tried now in U.S. Tax Court in Washington. A verdict is not expected for some time after the trial ends, expected in mid-April. The case is being watched closely by tax experts as a sign of rising tension between tax authorities and multinational corporations over transfer pricing, that is, the way companies value the goods, services, trademark and patent rights that they constantly move among foreign units across national boundaries. An important management discipline inside multinationals, transfer pricing is under more scrutiny than ever before from tax agencies worldwide because of strict new global standards, raising legal risks for companies and their investors. The Coca-Cola case goes to trial as interest among corporations in seeking multi-year deals with the IRS covering transfer pricing arrangements has fallen in the past two years. The IRS reported on Friday that it received 101 applications in 2017 for “advance pricing agreements” (APAs), similar to 2016’s level of 98 in 2016, but well below 2015’s peak of 183. APA applications also fell in 2016 in Japan, the top U.S. bilateral APA partner, according to the latest data. Anecdotal evidence suggests the APA process, designed to prevent conflict, is under strain in many countries, with some tax lawyers citing Mexico, Italy and China as challenging. Corporate tax directors at a conference in Washington earlier this month said APAs are taking longer to negotiate and government tax agencies are less willing to do them. “We’re really living in a different time and we can understand why tax authorities might be reluctant because there’s a lot more external scrutiny than there ever was,” said Amy Roberti, director of global tax and fiscal policy for Procter & Gamble Co, at the conference. Asked for more details afterward, Roberti said through a company spokeswoman that APAs help Procter & Gamble build “relationships with governments and fiscal authorities.” The IRS did not immediately provide answers to questions about the Coca-Cola case and transfer pricing, in general. Coca-Cola responded to questions by providing an internal employee memo about the case that said, “The company firmly believes that the IRS’ claims are without merit and will pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies.” The IRS contends that Coca-Cola charged several foreign affiliates royalties that were too low from 2007 to 2009, which reduced the parent company’s U.S. income and resulted in underpayment of its U.S. income taxes by $3.3 billion.

1024,KO,UPDATE 3-Russia lawmakers draft list of U.S. imports that could be banned,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s lower house of parliament is to consider draft legislation that would give the Kremlin powers to ban or restrict a list of U.S. imports, reacting to new U.S. sanctions on a group of Russian tycoons and officials. Senior lawmakers in the State Duma, which is dominated by Kremlin loyalists, said they had prepared the list ranging from food and alcohol to medicine and consulting services in response to Washington’s move last week.  It was not immediately clear if the draft legislation - which would allow the government to impose the measures should the need arise - would become law in its current form, or if it had the backing of the Kremlin.  A Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said it was understandable that Russian lawmakers wanted to retaliate against the U.S. measures. He said, though, that the Kremlin had yet to familiarise itself with the draft law. The Russian parliament is often used to send assertive messages to foreign states, but these do not always translate into concrete measures. Large-scale restrictions on U.S. goods and services would hurt American firms but could also cause significant disruption in Russia, where consumers flock to McDonald’s restaurants, fly on vacation in Boeing jets, and use Apple phones. The draft law, according to a text seen by Reuters, is aimed at protecting Russia’s interests and security in the face of “unfriendly and unlawful acts by the United States of America and other foreign states”. Russian currency and stock markets, preoccupied with the threat of U.S. military action in Syria and the fallout from Washington’s new sanctions, did not react to the draft legislation. It is to be discussed in the lower house next week.  The proposed measures are in retaliation for the White House’s imposition of the toughest set of sanctions on Russia since Moscow’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region in 2014, which dragged relations to their lowest point since the Cold War. Moscow reacted then with countersanctions banning a wide range of food imports from Western countries.  Russia imported $12.5 billion worth of U.S. products in 2017, according to official customs data. That included aircraft, machinery, pharmaceutical and chemical products. The draft legislation would give authorities the power to impose bans or restrictions in multiple areas of trade with the United States if they deemed that Washington was threatening Russia’s interests. The sectors listed in the draft which could be subject to bans or restrictions include U.S.-made software and farm goods, U.S. medicines that can be sourced elsewhere, and tobacco and alcohol. It gives the government the power to ban cooperation with the United States on atomic power, rocket engines and aircraft making, and to bar U.S. firms from taking part in Russian privatisation deals. The provision of auditing, legal and consulting services by U.S. firms could also be subject to bans or restrictions, and curbs could be imposed on U.S. citizens working in Russia. Western companies, including Ford Motor Co, PepsiCo Inc and Coca-Cola’s bottler Coca-Cola HBC, have also invested billions of dollars since the fall of the Soviet Union to set up local production in Russia.

1026,KO,"Coke warns of pain from UK sugar tax, U.S. freight costs","(Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) said on Tuesday it would take a hit in the second quarter from the introduction of a British sugar tax on soft drinks and rising freight costs in the United States, overshadowing modestly better than forecast results for the first three months of 2018. The somber forecast undid an initial rise in shares of the world’s biggest drinks maker after it topped forecasts for revenue and profit, helped by a reboot of its Diet Coke brand that has introduced new flavors and cans.  The company said it had reformulated recipes and launched smaller packaging to ensure that two-thirds of its major brands would not be subject to the new tax, but Coca-Cola Classic, its top-selling U.K. brand, will still face the levy, which kicked in on April 6. Company executives during a post-earnings call also cautioned that rising freight costs in North America, up 20 percent from a year earlier, would reduce revenue in the first half of the year. “People assumed that Coke sold to bottlers, and so some didn’t realize how much exposure the company has on freight,” said Brittany Weissman, a consumer analyst with Edward Jones. “But they do distribute and are affected.” U.S. packaged goods companies, already struggling with lower demand and price tensions with retailers, have recently begun flagging higher commodities and transportation costs.  A jump in volumes due to the timing of Easter holiday shipments and price cuts in North America helped Coca-Cola top first-quarter revenue estimate by $300 million. Total volumes rose 3 percent in the first quarter, with growth in both sodas and teas and coffees driving much of the gains.  Organic sales, which exclude gains from acquisitions or divestitures, rose 5 percent in the quarter. “While it’s good to see the underlying volumes improve, people are concerned on the pricing side, if those volumes are gaining at the expense of the price and mix,” said Weissman. First quarter net revenue fell 16 percent to $7.63 billion, due to the divestment of its bottling operations, but beat analysts’ estimates of $7.34 billion. Despite the strong results, Coca-Cola retained its full-year outlook for organic sales growth and earnings per share, which could also have disappointed investors, brokerage Macquarie said. Excluding items, net profit of 47 cents per share beat consensus forecasts by 1 cent, the company said.

1031,KO,"Pepsi tops estimates, promises more investments in North America","(Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc (PEP.O) reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue on Thursday as double-digit growth in developing markets offset another quarter of weak results in its North American beverage unit.   Like rival Coca-Cola (KO.N), the world’s second-biggest beverage maker is introducing new drinks to claw back ground in a U.S. market where sugary soda makers have suffered from consumers shifting toward healthier beverages, but its efforts are only slowly bearing fruit.  Sales in PepsiCo’s North America beverage unit, which accounts for nearly a third of total revenue and sells Lipton tea, Mountain Dew as well as Pepsi itself, fell by less than in previous quarters but were still down 1 percent. Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said on a post-earnings call PepsiCo was determined to reverse three quarters of decline and would step up spending on its marquee soda brand under a new “Pepsi Generations” campaign.  Nooyi said despite a moderate increase in media spending on trademark Pepsi over the past three years, the company’s market share has fallen dramatically relative to its key competitor. “We’ll go toe-to-toe and increase our spending in colas, in particular, but we’re going to remain very responsible on pricing,” Nooyi said. Earlier this week, Coke’s beverage sales blew past estimates, as it introduced four new flavors of Diet Coke and saw demand for Coke Zero sugar increase. PepsiCo’s new marketing efforts could further pressure operating profits, which have already shown weakness in its North American Frito-Lay, Quaker Foods and Beverages businesses, due to higher input costs as well as bonuses paid to employees following President Donald Trump’s Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Shares of the Purchase, New York-based company were around 0.3 percent higher by midday, having risen as much as 1.4 percent.    In contrast to North America, first-quarter sales in Latin American markets rose 14 percent, while those in Europe and sub-Saharan Africa gained 15 percent. Sales in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa were up 7 percent. The company’s Frito-Lay snacking business in North America did better than beverages, rising 3.4 percent in the quarter, although it missed expectations of 4 percent growth. The Quaker business - which includes the eponymous porridge oats - showed flat sales in North America due to cuts in pricing. “All North American units miss (but) LatAm (was) surprisingly strong,” Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein said.    Excluding items, Pepsi earned 96 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

1034,KO,UPDATE 3-Buffett's Berkshire swings to rare loss but performs better,"OMAHA, Neb. (Reuters) - Warren Buffett lost money but had a pretty good quarter. Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) on Saturday reported an unusual quarterly net loss, the result of an accounting change that Buffett had warned would produce “wild” but in his view meaningless swings in results. But Berkshire also ended a long stretch of disappointing operating performance, posting record operating profit as insurance rebounded from a difficult quarter while economic growth bolstered results in railroad, industrial and consumer businesses. Berkshire posted a first-quarter net loss of $1.14 billion, or $692 per Class A share, compared with net income of $4.06 billion, or $2,469 per share, a year earlier. The accounting change required Berkshire to report $6.2 billion of unrealized losses in its marketable stock portfolio, which totaled $170.5 billion at year end, regardless of whether it planned to sell those stocks. Two of Berkshire’s biggest stock investments, Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), had tough first quarters, falling 13.6 percent and 5.3 percent, respectively. Buffett has called the new accounting rule a “nightmare” that would produce “truly wild and capricious swings” in bottom-line results that could, depending on their direction, unnecessarily scare or embolden investors. “It really is not representative of what’s going on in the business at all,” Buffett told shareholders at Berkshire’s annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Berkshire said its operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 49 percent to $5.29 billion, or about $3,215 per Class A share, from $3.56 billion, or $2,163 per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected operating profit of about $3,116 per Class A share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating profit had previously fallen for five straight quarters, and missed Wall Street forecasts for eight straight. Book value, which measures assets minus liabilities, also took a hit from falling stock prices, falling 0.3 percent to $211,184 per Class A share, even though Buffett boosted his stake in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) by $12.5 billion in the quarter. Some analysts have said the stock losses have weighed on Berkshire shares, which are 10 percent below their record highs set on Jan. 29. In Friday trading, the Class A shares closed at$292,600, and the Class B shares at $195.64. Buffett, 87, and Vice Chairman Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 94, are answering five hours of questions from shareholders, journalists and analysts at the annual meeting. Despite the Apple purchase, Berkshire ended the quarter with $108.6 billion of cash and equivalents, giving Buffett ammunition to make one or more “huge” non-insurance acquisitions he has said he wants. Berkshire’s insurance businesses, which had been struggled with losses from hurricanes and other events, posted a $407 million underwriting profit, compared with a year earlier $267 million loss. Buffett said the Geico car insurer had “quite a good-sized turnaround in profitability.” Pre-tax underwriting gains nearly quadrupled, as it sold more policies despite having raised rates, while the rate of policyholder losses fell. “The trends look pretty good,” Tony Nicely, Geico’s chief executive, told Reuters on Friday. “The number of claims are down somewhat. Yet the costs keep going up.” An improving economy led to higher business volume at the BNSF railroad, which saw profit rise 37 percent to $1.15 billion. Pretax profit at industrial businesses such as Precision Castparts rose 32 percent, while lower taxes helped boost profit at the Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit by 22 percent.
