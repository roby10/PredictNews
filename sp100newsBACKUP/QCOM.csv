Qualcomm shares fell 2.27 percent in late trading on Wednesday after its forecast wireless chip shipments in a range of 120 million to 125 million was below analyst expectations for 130 million and higher and just above its third-quarter report of 120 million shipments.   While the company is known to issue cautious forecasts, some investors worried the lower than expected volume could be a sign of weakening demand.   “The market’s nervous that the economy is slowing. Any hints of that in quarterly calls is not being taken well by investors,” said Morgan Keegan analyst Tavis McCourt who had expected 135 million chip shipments this quarter.

4,QCOM,How to play it: Apple surges after stellar results,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Apple Inc’s stellar quarterly results trounced Wall Street expectations and sent the company’s shares up more than 5 percent on Wednesday. The iPhone maker said revenue nearly doubled in its fiscal third quarter.  The question: What’s the best way to take advantage of Apple’s climb and is there any downside?  The number one way to benefit from Apple’s momentum is to buy the company’s shares and hold onto them for at least two years, said Steve Coleman, a portfolio manager with Daedalus Capital who has owned Apple stock for seven years.  “It’s dirt cheap and its prospects are fabulous,” Coleman said. “I think it’s its own asset class and its own store of value.”  Apple shares’ record high of $396.27 hit on Wednesday marked a more than 20 percent gain from the start of the year and a more than 50 percent rise from a year ago to date. But given the high profile of Apple and company CEO Steve Jobs — who has been on leave since January for undisclosed medical reasons — the stock is also susceptible to short-term market swings.  “If something happens to Steve Jobs tomorrow, the stock may go down 50 bucks, so you have to be careful and have it in moderation,” said Gary Bradshaw, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management, who recommends starting with a 5 percent position. “There are always things that could trip them up.”  The stock has also benefited from the bullish sentiment in the tech sector after International Business Machines Corp, a bellwether for the industry, delivered strong earnings earlier this week. The S&P information technology index jumped 2.7 percent, the best performing sector, on Tuesday.  Ticonderoga Securities raised its 12-month price target for Apple to $666 from $612 on Wednesday, citing the combination of Apple’s inexpensive valuation and momentum.  While suppliers may benefit down the line from Apple’s business growth, many of these companies are not necessarily known because Apple makes it a point not to disclose names.  As a consequence, there is not as much certainty over to what extent Apple suppliers are poised to benefit from Apple’s profit climb. Even among the known suppliers, their stock will not necessarily jump in tandem with Apple’s because of additional factors like individual company earnings or announcements.  Cirrus Logic and OmniVision Technologies are two Apple suppliers that have benefited from Apple’s upswing. Cirrus shares closed up 4.4 percent on Wednesday, while OmniVision shares rose 3.3 percent.  “The suppliers will definitely benefit,” said Bradshaw, who owns both Cirrus and OmniVision and calls them “top positions.”  Among other known Apple providers, shares of semiconductor provider Marvell fell 0.7 percent on Wednesday, while digital wireless product maker Qualcomm shares were up 0.6 percent and chip maker Intel Corp shares were down 0.3 percent. APPLE OPTIONS  Apple shares have been a winning bet for a long time but with the stock nearing $400 some option strategists suggest investors could look to minimize their risk by betting on more gains, only not exorbitant ones.  Assuming a stock will only rally a little bit is not normal for someone who only invests in stocks. But for investors who use the options market, it’s a common occurrence, says Steve Place, a founder of options analytics firm InvestingWithOptions in Mobile, Alabama.  The way to put on trades like this is not easy — it takes a bit of knowledge about how options work. Unlike a stock, options have other components that influence pricing, one of which is time decay — an erosion of the options premium as it nears expiration.  One trade suggested by Place is a so-called “iron butterfly” strategy. He recommends the September Apple options contracts to implement this strategy. The iron butterfly is a short volatility bet and has a limited risk, limited reward that makes money if the stock stays around a certain price of the investor’s choosing, said Place.  This trade involves selling a straddle — that is, selling a put option and a call option at the same strike price and expiration date. For instance, selling a call at a $400 strike price and selling a put with the same strike price — that is a bet against volatility.  The next step is to buy a “strangle,” which involves buying a call and a put with two different strike prices — both out-of-the-money — with the same expiration date.  Adding a strangle would limit the risk of a strong move in the underlying shares. The bet makes money if the stock remains close to the strike price of the straddle — such as $400.

6,QCOM,Qualcomm weak shipment forecast worries investors,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) said it will ship fewer cellphone chips than expected this quarter because its customers are shaving product inventories, sending its shares down almost 3 percent as investors worried the move could signal weakening demand due to an economic slowdown.  Qualcomm raised its financial targets for the quarter, but this was not enough to impress investors who expected higher volume chip sales for a quarter during which devices like the next Apple Inc (AAPL.O) iPhone are expected to launch.  Chief Financial Officer William Keitel said wireless device makers are reducing inventories because they had built excess stockpiles on concerns about supply shortages in the aftermath of the earthquake in Japan earlier this year.  Keitel said Qualcomm customers were being cautious even as he saw no evidence of slowing demand from consumers.  “With a relatively modest world economy, it’s an environment where our customers are extra judicious,” Keitel said in a telephone interview.  By the end of this quarter Qualcomm customers will have cut about a week’s worth of inventory, according to Keitel, who said they had kept roughly enough inventory for 15 weeks at the end of June.  “It’s a fairly small adjustment,” Keitel said, who added that inventory levels averaged between 15 and 20 weeks over the last several years, but inventories in general had become leaner after the 2008/2009 global economic crisis.  Qualcomm forecast wireless chip shipments for the current quarter in a range of 120 million to 125 million compared with analyst expectations for 130 million and higher and its fiscal third-quarter report of 120 million shipments.  “The market’s nervous that the economy is slowing. Any hints of that in quarterly calls is not being taken well by investors,” said Morgan Keegan analyst Tavis McCourt who had expected 135 million chip shipments this quarter.  While quarter ending in September usually shows modest sequential growth the forecast was “a little lighter than normal,” McCourt said.  Qualcomm’s report came on the same day that chip giant Intel Corp (INTC.O) trimmed its forecast for 2011 personal computer unit sales, sending its shares down.  However, Qualcomm raised its earnings per share guidance for the full year 2011 to a range of $3.15 to $3.20 from its previous expectation for $3.05 to $3.13.  It also increased its revenue target for the year to a range of $14.7 billion to $15 billion from its previous expectation of $14.1 billion to $14.7 billion.  Keitel attributed the higher revenue and profits to improving technology license sales because a greater percentage of phones being sold were smartphones, which command higher license fees.  Qualcomm’s profit rose to $1.035 billion, or 61 cents per share, for its fiscal third quarter ended in June 26 from $767 million, or 47 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  Excluding unusual items, it earned 73 cents per share, ahead of analyst expectations for 71 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $3.62 billion from $2.7 billion.

12,QCOM,Economic jitters threaten holiday chip cheer,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Makers of chips for TVs, game consoles and other consumer electronics aren’t expecting much for Christmas, but insatiable demand for high-end gadgets like Apple’s iPad will likely deliver some cheer.  Texas Instruments, Intel and Qualcomm are normally busy this time of year churning out microchips for consumer electronics — typically the hottest tickets during the annual holiday season from November to December.  But persistently high U.S. unemployment and the risk of further economic slowdown, along with the danger of a European financial crisis, have soured many manufacturers’ moods, according to a growing chorus of chip executives.  Even blockbuster expectations for smartphones have cooled slightly.  “Wherever we look right now there’s macroeconomic uncertainty,” ARM Holdings Chief Executive Warren East told analysts on a conference call on Tuesday. “There is uncertainty about consumer expenditure.”  Cambridge, England-based ARM, whose chip technology is widely used in smartphones and tablets, warned that an uptick in chip manufacturing typically seen ahead of Christmas might be smaller than normal this year.  “Consumer spending is cautious,” said Longbow Research analyst JoAnne Feeney. “(Product manufacturers) are in a wait-and-see holding pattern. They want to see whether demand materializes before they build more televisions, set-top boxes and cameras.”  Last week, Intel cut its outlook for 2011 PC shipments and said growth would come from China and other emerging markets instead of the United States or Europe.  3M Co said on Tuesday its display and graphics segment fell in the June quarter, reflecting less demand for LCD TVs and a tighter consumer electronics market.  Because many of its products are low-cost, quickly used and sold all over the world, 3M is a barometer of global industrial health.  Texas Instruments said on Monday computing and consumer electronics customers concerned about the economy were ordering fewer chips than usual for this time of year. It said store shelves could fill up later than usual this holiday shopping season.  As well as tough economic times, ripples from Japan’s earthquake in March are still affecting the industry.  Electronics manufacturers that deliberately ordered extra components following the disaster are now less worried about shortages and are beginning to work through their inventories, leading to fewer new orders, said CLSA analyst Srini Pajjuri.  Consumer appetite for Apple’s smartphones is as strong as ever, but growth at competitors like Nokia, Research in Motion and LG Electronics has faltered.  And a slew of tablets meant to compete with the iPad have failed to take off, adding to inventories of chips that had been manufactured in anticipation of higher sales but have gone unused.  “Demand for smartphones and tablets is OK, but it’s not as good as people were thinking,” said MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum. “Plus smartphones and feature phones have a big headwind in Europe, which is a very important market.”  Smartphone shipments this year will grow about 38 percent, according to market research firm IHS iSuppli. Analysts earlier this year had forecast expansion of around 50 percent.  Shares of Broadcom, which makes Bluetooth and other wireless chips and counts Apple as a key customer, soared 9 percent after the Irvine, California company gave a rosier-than-expected quarterly outlook.  Some investors expect larger wireless chipmaker Qualcomm to supply key chips for Apple’s next iPhone and to continue to increase its content in Apple’s devices.  Qualcomm last week raised its guidance for the current quarter, although Chief Financial Officer William Keitel warned that economic uncertainty was making customers “extra judicious”.  Chipmakers that do their own manufacturing, instead of contracting it out, and that have inventories on hand, may be able to respond in time to any last-minute holiday orders should the outlook for consumer demand improve.

14,QCOM,UPDATE 2-ARM cautious on Christmas holiday sales," * Q2 sales, profit beats expectations   * Sees sequential rise in industry revenue in current quarter   * Says Q4 harder to predict due to worries on consumer confidence   * Shares reverse early gains, down 2.2 pct   (Adds CEO comments, analyst reaction, shares)	   By Paul Sandle	   LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - ARM Holdings sounded a note of caution about electronic goods sales this coming Christmas, overshadowing a better-than-expected second-quarter where its technology, already dominant in mobile phones and tablets, was licensed for more and more uses.	   The Cambridge-based company, whose processor designs are used by Samsung Electronics , Qualcomm and Texas Instruments , sold 29 licenses in the quarter, helping pretax profit rise 25 percent to 54.2 million pounds ($88.3 million) on 18 percent higher revenue of 117.8 million pounds.	   ARM said it expected industry revenue in the second quarter, which drives its third-quarter royalties, to tick up quarter-on-quarter, but it kept forecasts for the year unchanged, indicating less confidence on sales ahead of the key Christmas period.	   “There’s obviously a number of broad macro economic uncertainties that make us cautious as to whether the normal seasonal uptick you see at the end of the year, ahead of Christmas, is as significant as it had been in some other years,” Finance Director Tim Score told reporters on Tuesday. 	   Shares in the company rose as much as 2.6 percent as the market welcomed strong license sales, before reversing the gains on worries about consumer spending.	   They were 2.4 percent lower at 601.5 pence by 0907 GMT, underperforming a 0.2 percent weaker FTSE 100 index . 	   Analyst Paul Morland at Peel Hunt said the results were “excellent”, but with the shares trading at 54 times this year’s earnings, they were vulnerable to a set of quarterly results that did not meet the market’s high expectations.	   “With royalties recognised one quarter in arrears and several semi stocks recently reporting something of a slowdown for Q3, there is a risk that Q4 could be a disappointing quarter for ARM,” he said.	   Score said the strong license sales would drive future royalties as ARM chips were designed into products ranging from cars, air conditioners and running machines to smartphones and computers.	   “We are building that installed license base quicker than we ever have done in the past,” he said.	   ARM shipped 1.1 billion processors based on its architecture in smartphones and tablets, including Apple’s iPhone and iPad, in the quarter. Sales of its chips in smartphones tend to deliver the biggest royalty payments for the company.	   But while consumers’ appetite for Apple’s products is as strong as ever, growth at competing handset makers such as Nokia  , Research in Motion , and LG has faltered. 	   Score said increasing competition among smartphone makers would be good for ARM even if average selling prices of chips fell.	   “The more competitive the environment the better it is for the ARM business,” he said. “We don’t try to pick winners, we try to enable the field. The chipmakers that win will end up paying us the most royalties.”	   ARM is also eyeing the PC and eventually server markets, which are the strongholds of Intel. 	   Microsoft is already designing the next generation of Windows software for ARM-based processors, and a number of manufacturers are planning ARM-based notebooks running Google’s  Chrome operating system later this year.	   “The computing space generally is a longer-term opportunity for us in terms of meaningful royalties,” Score said. “For those to come through the building blocks need to be being put in place now.”	   Analysts had expected the group to report pretax profit of 45.3 million pounds on revenue of 109.1 million pounds.

16,QCOM,Alibaba launches smartphone running its Cloud OS,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Alibaba Group launched its first self-developed mobile operating system and smartphone on Thursday in a bid to capture a slice of China’s rapidly growing mobile Internet market.  The cloud computing-based operating system, Aliyun, will run the K-Touch Cloud Smartphone, to be launched at the end of July in 10 colors, said Wang Jian, president of Alibaba Cloud Computing, a unit of Alibaba Group.  A tablet PC running the Aliyun OS, which is based on a customized Android system, will also be launched in China by the end of the year, Wang told reporters after a presentation in Beijing.  Handset manufacturer Tianyu will manufacture the K-Touch as well as the tablet, Wang said.  “Mobile users want a more open and convenient mobile OS, one that allows them to truly enjoy all that the Internet has to offer, right in the palm of their hand, and the cloud OS, with its use of cloud-based applications, will provide that,” said  The Aliyun operating system will feature cloud services such as email, Internet search and support for web-based applications. Users will not be required to download or install applications onto their mobile devices, Wang said.  Alibaba Cloud plans to integrate the operating system with other devices including mobile phones with larger screens and tablet computers in the coming months.  Wang said the company was looking to launch tablet computers running Aliyun by the end of the year.  The company is currently in talks with Qualcomm Inc to develop a lower-end chipset optimized to run Aliyun OS in lower-end mobile phones, Wang said. The K-Touch phones use a high-end chipset from Nvidia Corp for crisp display of intricate games.  Alibaba Group, which is 40 percent owned by Yahoo Inc, operates China’s largest B2B online marketplace, Alibaba.com, and China’s largest online consumer shopping site, Taobao.com.  Wang said Alibaba does not have sales targets for the K-Touch. “We are not responsible for selling the phone; we just provide the system, so there is no hard number,” he said, adding that within 15 minutes of the end of Thursday’s presentation, Alibaba sold 1,000 of the phones on Taobao.  Alibaba will have an English-language version of the Aliyun OS ready by the end of this year, but Wang could not say when English versions of the phones and tablets might go on sale.  Nor will Alibaba get into the phone-manufacturing business, Wang said. “We shouldn’t make a phone,” he said. “We’re not in that ecosystem, and it’s a very good decision not to make a phone.”  China, the world’s largest mobile phone market, has nearly 907 million mobile subscribers, according to statistics provided by the three leading telcos in June.  The firm has been busy diversifying away from its core business of e-commerce into search, logistics and now mobile computing. Baidu, Alibaba’s big Internet rival in China, has also been diversifying away from its core business of search into e-commerce and it has hinted that it is developing a mobile operating system as well.

20,QCOM,UPDATE 3-RIM tilts at iPhone with new BlackBerry phones,"   * RIM says browser 40 percent faster than original Torch   * Touchscreens for all; faster processors, better display   * RIM stock, market share down since last phone launch   * Shares up 5 percent  (Adds analyst quote, updates with closing stock price)   By Alastair Sharp   TORONTO, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Research In Motion RIM.TO unveiled two new versions of its touchscreen BlackBerry Torch on Wednesday as it seeks to regain ground it has lost to Apple and Google with powerful consumer-friendly models.   Investors reacted favorably, pushing RIM’s deflated stock price up more than 5 percent. But some analysts were skeptical, given delays leading up to this launch. They said a radically new software package due next year would be RIM’s big test.   The new Torch models include an all-touch version that mimics the popular style of Apple’s iPhone and most Android devices. Along with a previously announced upgrade to its workhorse Bold model, they are part of what the Canadian company called the biggest global launch in its history.   “The pure touch model could be very interesting. It has some great tech in terms of computing horsepower,” said Will Stofega, a mobile device analyst at research firm IDC.   He dismissed concern that consumers would snub the devices while waiting for “superphones” due out next year using the QNX operating system that powers RIM’s PlayBook tablet and said the phones could tempt buyers away from the iPhone.   “What people seem to want is a vibrant, iconic, shiny device,” he said.   RIM has lagged its competitors in bringing out must-have phones with speedy browsers, and its PlayBook competitor to Apple’s iPad launched to dismal reviews in April.   The company is slashing 2,000 jobs to reduce costs and streamline operations after reporting a fall in quarterly profit and a dismal earnings outlook. [ID:nL3E7IP251]   It has already promised “superphones” next year using the QNX-based operating system that runs the PlayBook, so analysts are looking beyond this launch.   “This is a necessary product refresh in advance of the big bang that we hope and expect will happen with QNX-based phones,” said John Jackson, vice-president of research at CCS Insight.   The three touchscreen BlackBerrys are RIM’s most powerful yet. They run on an upgraded operating system, boast improved displays and pack a 1.2 GHz processor from Qualcomm (QCOM.O) as well as dedicated graphics processor that should make video and gaming sharper and more responsive.   RIM says the browser is 40 percent faster than the original Torch, its last major phone launch, which hit shelves almost a year ago. [ID:nLDE67301J]   “RIM’s new BlackBerry smartphones could well be the most important devices in the Canadian smart device vendor’s history, following a recent slowdown in device shipments, staff cuts and doubts over the company’s strategy and leadership,” Ovum analyst Tony Cripps said.   All three devices will be launched by carriers around the world by the end of August, RIM said. The slider Torch, with both a keyboard and a touch screen, will be exclusive to AT&T (T.N) in the United States from this month, the carrier said, while AT&T will offer the other phones later in the year.   The all-touch Torch is RIM’s first attempt at the popular style since two versions of its Storm model failed to excite.   “It’s definitely an acknowledgment that there are people that want that full-touch device,” RIM’s newly promoted global head of sales, Patrick Spence, said in a phone interview.   The timing could boost RIM’s earnings for the quarter to late August as it sells the phones to carriers. But figures for user sales won’t be available until the following quarter.   RIM shipped 13.2 million phones in the three months to late May — its first fall in shipments from a previous quarter since at least mid-2007 — as it pushed the launch of the latest products back to August.   RIM’s aging hardware and software have looked increasing outdated as manufacturers such as Motorola (MMI.N), Samsung (005930.KS) and HTC (2498.TW) push out sleek, large-screen devices using Android and its applications.   Its market share has fallen steeply in the United States, according to data compiled by research firm Gartner. The global fall has been less severe, but from a smaller starting point.   “What would constitute success for these guys is essentially holding the fort,” CCS’s Jackson said. “A stop-loss outcome would be a success for these products in developed markets.”   Shares of Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM have dropped 65 percent from their peak in February. The stock rose $1.18 to $25.33 on the Nasdaq and was up C$1.19 at C$24.42 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.   The shares closed Tuesday at their lowest level in five years.

21,QCOM,RIM launches two new BlackBerry Torch phones,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Research In Motion went on the offensive on Wednesday, unveiling two new and powerful versions of its touchscreen BlackBerry Torch, including an all-touch model, as it seeks to regain ground lost to Apple and Google.  The new phones, along with an upgrade to its Bold model shown earlier, are part of what the Canadian company called the biggest global launch in its history as it seeks to claw back North American market share from Apple’s iPhone and a slew of devices running on Google’s Android software.  The refreshed lineup is designed to buy RIM time until it introduces a radically new software package for its smartphones next year.  Investors reacted favorably, pushing RIM’s deflated stock price up 5 percent by midday.  “RIM’s new BlackBerry smartphones could well be the most important devices in the Canadian smart device vendor’s history, following a recent slowdown in device shipments, staff cuts and doubts over the company’s strategy and leadership,” Ovum analyst Tony Cripps said.  RIM is slashing 2,000 jobs from its global workforce to reduce costs and streamline operations after posting a fall in profit and a dismal earnings outlook in its last quarterly report.  The three touchscreen phones, running on the new BlackBerry OS 7, boast improved screen displays and pack a 1.2 GHz processor from Qualcomm, the most powerful ever for a BlackBerry phone. They also have a dedicated graphics processor that should make video and gaming sharper and more responsive.  The browser is 40 percent faster than the original Torch, RIM’s last major phone launch, which hit shelves almost a year ago.

The timing could boost RIM’s earnings for the quarter ending in late August as it sells the phones to carriers, but evidence of uptake among users won’t be available until the following quarter.  Since Co-Chief Executive Mike Lazaridis has already promised “superphones” next year using the QNX-based operating system that runs RIM’s PlayBook tablet computer, analysts are looking beyond this launch.  “This is a necessary product refresh in advance of the big bang that we hope and expect will happen with QNX-based phones,” said John Jackson, vice-president of research at CCS Insight.

RIM’s aging hardware and software have looked increasing outdated as manufacturers such as Motorola, Samsung and HTC push out sleek, large-touchscreen devices using Android and its extensive offering of applications.  The slider Torch looks identical to the original touchscreen device with a slideout Qwerty keyboard, but it packs more powerful insides.  The Bold upgrade includes a near-field communications (NFC) chip to turn the phone into a mobile wallet. It was first shown at RIM’s BlackBerry World conference in May.  RIM’s North American market share has fallen in the past year as high-end Android devices proliferate and U.S. carrier Verizon added Apple’s iPhone to its lineup. Globally the fall has been less severe, but from a smaller starting point, according to data compiled by research firms CCS Insight and Gartner.  U.S. sales accounted for less than 27 percent of RIM’s revenue in the most recent quarter, down from 50 percent a year earlier, as international markets picked up some of the slack.  “What would constitute success for these guys is essentially holding the fort,” CCS’s Jackson said. “A stop-loss outcome would be a success for these products in developed markets.”  Shares of Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM have dropped 65 percent from their peak in February as the company’s earnings and outlook missed expectations and its PlayBook failed to dent the iPad’s dominance of the tablet market.  The stock was up more than a dollar at $25.37 on the Nasdaq and at C$24.47 on the Toronto Stock Exchange at midday on Wednesday. It closed on Tuesday at its lowest level in five years, giving the company a market capitalization of $12.7 billion.

22,QCOM,RIM launches two new BlackBerry Torch phones,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Research In Motion RIM.TO on Wednesday took the wraps off two more powerful versions of its touchscreen BlackBerry Torch, aiming to buy time until it can introduce a radically new software package in its smartphones.  The new phones, along with a Bold upgrade unveiled earlier, are part of what the Canadian company called its biggest global launch ever as it seeks to claw back North American market share losses from Apple’s (AAPL.O) iconic iPhone and a slew of devices running on Google’s (GOOG.O) Android software.  Investors reacted favorably, pushing RIM’s deflated stock price up 3 percent.  “RIM’s new BlackBerry smartphones could well be the most important devices in the Canadian smart device vendor’s history, following a recent slowdown in device shipments, staff cuts and doubts over the company’s strategy and leadership,” Ovum analyst Tony Cripps said.  The three touchscreen phones, running on the new BlackBerry OS 7, boast improved screen displays and pack a 1.2 GHz processor from Qualcomm (QCOM.O), the most powerful ever for a BlackBerry phone. All three devices will launch with carriers globally by the end of August, RIM said.  The browser is 40 percent faster than the original Torch, hit shelves almost a year ago.  But since co-chief executive Mike Lazaridis has already promised “superphones” next year using the QNX-based operating system that runs RIM’s PlayBook tablet computer, analysts are looking beyond the launch.  “This is a necessary product refresh in advance of the big bang that we hope and expect will happen with QNX-based phones,” said CCS Insight vice-president of research John Jackson.

24,QCOM,UPDATE 1-US regulators link reviews of AT&T;'s transactions," * AT&T’s proposed deals to undergo coordinated FCC review   * FCC stops clock on review of Qualcomm deal  (Adds comments from analysts and AT&T)   By Jasmin Melvin   WASHINGTON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc’s (T.N) $1.9 billion offer for some of Qualcomm Inc’s (QCOM.O) wireless licenses will be tied to a simultaneous review of AT&T’s $39 billion proposed takeover of T-Mobile USA, U.S. communications regulators said in a letter sent late on Monday.   The Federal Communications Commission, citing the many related issues, dropped the agency’s informal 180-day timeline for review of the Qualcomm deal.   The move could significantly delay completion of the smaller Qualcomm deal because the review of AT&T’s bid for Deutsche Telekom AG’s (DTEGn.DE) T-Mobile is expected to extend at least into the first quarter of 2012.   Qualcomm said swift action on its deal was in line with the FCC’s goal to free up more airwaves for mobile broadband use.   The company said the deal would not only re-purpose unused spectrum for wireless Internet services, but it would also allow it to invest and deploy more spectrum efficient technology.   “The FCC should approve the pending AT&T-Qualcomm spectrum sale now because of the clear benefits to the public from the sale that stand on their own and are totally unrelated to the proposed AT&T-T-Mobile merger,” Dean Brenner, vice president of government affairs for Qualcomm, said in a statement.   But the FCC said it was concerned about AT&T amassing spectrum across the country, especially in overlapping areas, among other issues.   “We have concluded that the best way to determine whether either or both of the proposed transactions serve the public interest is to consider them in a coordinated manner at this time,” the FCC’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau said in a letter to AT&T and Qualcomm.   The decision does not prevent the agency from considering the deals separately at a later date.   An AT&T spokesman said the company is hopeful the Qualcomm deal could still be resolved ahead of the merger.   However, Stifel Nicolaus analysts said in a research note that a decision on the Qualcomm deal will likely not be made until review of the T-Mobile merger nears or is completed.   The FCC is weighing whether the proposed merger with T-Mobile is in the public interest, while the Justice Department is conducting an antitrust review.   If approved as proposed, the merger would concentrate 80 percent of the U.S. wireless market in just two companies: AT&T/T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless, a venture of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) and Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L).   AT&T argues the purchase of T-Mobile will help it expand faster service to more customers. Critics charge that less competition will increase prices and limit consumer choice.   Public interest groups, including the Consumers Union, Free Press, the Media Access Project, Public Knowledge and the New America Foundation, asked the FCC in April to link the reviews of AT&T’s transactions, saying the deals would “further empower an already dominant wireless carrier to leverage its control over devices, backhaul, and consumers in ways that stifle competition.”   AT&T has said U.S. government remedies to free up more U.S. airwaves for wireless services are not coming fast enough and were an important driver behind its plans to acquire T-Mobile.   AT&T estimates it will carry the equivalent of the volume of all the mobile traffic it handled last year in just the first six or seven weeks of 2015, as explosive demand continues for wireless devices such as Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhone.   A spectrum shortage would mean clogged networks, more dropped calls and slower connection speeds for wireless customers.

27,QCOM,"Apple, Qualcomm, others eye InterDigital","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc, Nokia and Qualcomm Inc are among several technology companies pondering bids for InterDigital Inc, sources familiar with the situation said.  The auction of the wireless telecommunications specialist — expected to be heavily contested as giant tech companies fight to shore up patent portfolios — will be postponed from next week until after Labor Day, the sources said.  Shares in InterDigital, which has a market value of about $3 billion, leaped as much as 12.2 percent on the news. But it quickly backtracked and was up $4.38 or 6.8 percent at $68.41 in afternoon trade.  Key potential bidder Google Inc has not formally withdrawn from the auction but it is unclear whether the Internet leader will bid for the company, the sources told Reuters.  InterDigital is up for sale and is forging ahead with its auction, despite Google agreeing to buy Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc for $12.5 billion. That triggered a 23 percent drop in InterDigital’s shares on Monday.  First-round bids have been postponed because bidders asked for more time to complete due diligence on the company’s patents, the sources said.  To make up for that delay, the King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based company expects to accelerate the second round, the sources said.  Google’s presence in the auction would be crucial to how much InterDigital could fetch, an analyst said.  “The problem InterDigital has is that Elvis has left the building. He’s got his date,” Deutsche Bank analyst Brian Modoff said.  Modoff also questioned whether any other technology companies need InterDigital enough to pay the high price at which its shares are currently trading.  He noted that Qualcomm already has a good portfolio of patents, and so may not want to pay up for the business.  “The problem is finding somebody else to whom it’s necessary.” Modoff said. “It could get acquired, but not at where the stock is at (now).”  InterDigital’s stock had soared last month on reports that Google was in talks to buy the company. Bidders have been eager to get their hands on the company’s 8,800 patents — including crucial 3G and 4G/LTE patents to strengthen operating software for smartphones.  Some analysts have said that InterDigital has one of the best quality patent portfolios that remains on the market after bankrupt Nortel Network’s sold its patents to a consortium led by Apple and Microsoft Corp last month.  Just over 50 percent of the current 3G market is already under license with InterDigital. Its partners include Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Apple, Research In Motion Ltd and HTC Corp, among others. The company’s 4G portfolio is relatively unlicensed.

30,QCOM,"Marvell's outlook reassures investors, shares up","(Reuters) - Shares of Marvell Technology Group (MRVL.O) rose 13 percent in pre-market trading on Friday, a day after the company gave third-quarter outlook largely above estimates which allayed Street concerns that its mobile business was hurting.  The company, which makes processor chips used in smartphones and also provides microcontrollers to hard drive makers, projected third-quarter revenue of $940-$980 million, largely above prior consensus of $958.1 million.  “Marvell’s product cycles in TDMA based-Smartphones, Solid-State Drive controllers ... provide visibility into growth in 2012,” Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis said.  Shares of the company have been battered at the stock market and have lost over almost half their value since touching a high of $22 in January.  “We think that the case that Marvell is out of favor in the investment community is an easy one to make. For starters, Marvell is the worst-performing semiconductor stock in 2010-11 and third-worst performer year-to-date,” Lipacis said.  Lipacis, slashed his target price by a $1 to $17 on the company’s stock on valuation concerns but maintained his “buy” rating on the stock.  At least three other brokerages also cut their target price on similar concerns.  “We view July quarter results and guidance as a positive catalyst relative to investor expectations and Marvell’s recent stock performance,” Kauffman Brothers analyst Mike Burton said.  Marvell shares have lost 36 percent in value since the beginning of the year, trailing the broader Dow Jones US Semiconductor Index .DJUSSC, which has lost 16 percent during the period.  Shares of the company were trading up 7 percent at $12.78 before markets opened. They had closed at $11.97 on Thursday on Nasdaq.

31,QCOM,Talent agency CAA mulls Silicon Valley office,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Creative Artists Agency, the largest talent representation firm in Hollywood, is considering opening an office in Silicon Valley to expand ties with the technology community, according to two people familiar with the firm’s plans.  CAA, whose client roster includes Brad Pitt, Oprah Winfrey and Peyton Manning, wants an “on the ground presence” in Palo Alto, these sources said. An outpost in Silicon Valley would help ease the travel load of CAA agents, some of whom already shuttle between Los Angeles and Palo Alto, California, three or four times a week.  Currently, the agency’s business in Silicon Valley is divided into three: advising tech companies about Hollywood, partnering with venture capital firms to incubate start-ups and matching clients who have digital media ideas with companies that can help bring them to fruition.  Having regular contact with tech executives will also give CAA the opportunity to sign them up for representation on the speaking circuit and other endeavors outside of technology, both sources said.  The agency already represents Twitter co-founder Biz Stone, former Facebook executive Randi Zuckerberg — the sister of Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg — and other tech executives through its CAA Speakers division.  The plans under consideration by CAA underscore the idea that software developers and computer engineers are the new creative community and tech executives — not media moguls — are the rock stars of the business world.  A representative for CAA declined comment. One of the sources said CAA is extremely methodical about its business plans and is likely to “proceed very slowly” with any proposal to set up its own shingle in Silicon Valley.  “They aren’t going to put up a big building with signage on it and dispatch a dozen agents to the Valley,” this source said. “It’ll be much more of a subtle presence.”  Hollywood’s talent agencies started circling around Silicon Valley in the late 1990s, but were scared off after the dotcom bubble burst in 2000. Over the last few years, however, they have resumed efforts to diversify their client base and create new revenue opportunities.  But David Siminoff, a former partner with venture capital firm Venrock Ventures, said culture clashes often make it hard for Hollywood and Silicon Valley to work together.  Technology types tend not to pay much attention to movies and television shows, and the relatively paltry sum of studio revenues compared with those of hi-tech giants such as Apple Inc mean they do not take Hollywood seriously, Siminoff said.  On the Hollywood side, the appetite for risk when it comes to tech investments is too low and the ongoing threat of disruption to an already eroding business model too great.  “Most old media guys are afraid of technology,” Siminoff told Reuters.  Siminoff has first-hand experience with this dynamic. While at Venrock, he was instrumental in setting up an incubator fund with talent agency William Morris Endeavor, venture capital firm Accel Partners, and AT&T Inc. Known as the Mail Room Fund, it had between $30 million and $50 million under management, but only invested around $5 million of that in three companies before shutting down in April.  Similarly, United Talent Agency helped incubate online video site 60Frames, but that wound down in 2009 after two years of operation because of a lack of funding.  CAA has experienced its own blips as well. In 2007, the agency was in preliminary talks to raise a $150 million to $200 million fund for start-up investments with venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson that ultimately broke down.  That same year, CAA teamed up with Internet television service Joost, tapping relationships with movie studios, television networks and record labels to supply programing. That website never gained traction against Google Inc’s YouTube and was shut down less than two years after its launch.  CAA now holds equity stakes in several digital media companies, including Will Ferrell’s comedy site Funnyordie.com; Encore Career Institute, which offers extended education through online courses for baby-boomers; and a social media site for celebrities called Whosay.  The agency is not expected to set up an incubator fund or raise new money for Silicon Valley investments, said one of the sources. Instead, CAA plans to continue its strategy of investing directly in start-ups with venture capital firms.  The agency is likely to follow the model it established with wireless chip maker Qualcomm Inc. The two companies are partners on a venture called Creative Mobile Labs, which marries ideas for mobile apps from CAA’s talent roster with Qualcomm engineers who can build the apps.  Technology companies are cultivating their own relationships with Hollywood outside the talent agencies as well. Last November, Twitter recruited former CAA executive Omid Ashtari to be its “L.A. person” as he told AllThingsD.com. Twitter told the blog that Ashtari will be charged with “entertainment business development.”  ",8242011,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-creativeartists/talent-agency-caa-mulls-silicon-valley-office-idUSTRE77N6CR20110824

Ottawa-based Zarlink designs mixed-signal chip technology for communications and medical applications, an area that industry giants such as Intel (INTC.O), Texas Instruments TXN.N and Qualcomm (QCOM.O) are either entering or are already active in.  “They should not have too much of a problem generating interest,” said an industry analyst who could not comment publicly on the deal. “The process is set up, they’ve opened their data room.”  Zarlink says California-based Microsemi’s (MSCC.O)’s C$3.35 a share offer undervalues both the company and its prospects. Markets also seem confident that a higher bid will come, with Zarlink shares trading consistently above the offer price.  “The Microsemi bid seems to only reflect the known cash flows Zarlink will generate,” said Jeff Mo, a portfolio manager at Mawer Investment Management, who, according to Thomson Reuters data, owns 2.4 percent of Zarlink shares, and who is looking for a higher bid.  “We feel Microsemi is undervaluing the growth opportunities of Zarlink.”  Zarlink shares were at C$3.50 on Thursday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, more than double last November’s year low. But that is still below the C$3.55 that Microsemi says it would pay under the right circumstances.  Microsemi went hostile with a formal offer on August 17, following up on a public proposal in July, and after behind-the-scenes talks with Zarlink that started in January.  Zarlink, which builds wireless chips for implantable medical devices like pacemakers and defibrillators, is a tiny player in an industry dominated by giants that typically operate many semiconductor lines to take advantage of economies of scale.  In an August 17 research note, GMP Securities analyst Michael Urlocker said Zarlink could be worth as much as C$4.30 a share if were sold in two or three parts.  “We think there is a basis on which to consider that Zarlink would be attractive to other companies,” he said.  Urlocker named Intel, a $100 billion company that bought Zarlink’s consumer products business in 2005, and which could be interested in expanding into medical applications. He also named Texas Instruments, Qualcomm and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI.O), which in 2009 bought another semiconductor business from Zarlink Chairman Adam Chowaniec.

Zarlink said third parties were interested in buying either part or all of the Ottawa-based company, which designs computer chips for communications and medical applications.  “Based on the level of interest which has been expressed to date ... it is likely that a transaction will emerge from the board’s strategic process which is superior to the Microsemi offers,” Zarlink Chairman Adam Chowaniec said in a statement.  Zarlink did not identify the suitors, but analysts say its award-winning medical applications technology - it builds wireless chips for medical devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators - could attract such industry giants as Intel, Texas Instruments and Qualcomm, which are either entering or active in the sector.  California-based Microsemi has offered C$3.35 a share for Zarlink, but the shares have consistently traded higher than that since Microsemi first made its proposal public in July, suggesting the market thinks a higher bid is likely.  Zarlink said several parties have started due diligence and expressed interest in pursuing a transaction.  “Fifteen is a big number, and I’ve always thought, from day one since this thing was announced, that there was a high probability of at least one rival bid. I continue to hold to that view,” said Brian Piccioni, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets.  Jeff Mo, a portfolio manager whose firm Mawer Investment Management holds a 2.4 percent stake in Zarlink, also expects a higher bid.  “In our sensitivity analysis we felt that Zarlink could be worth between C$3.50 and C$4.50 a share,” he said.  But Microsemi held to its cash offer price on Thursday, saying the Zarlink board had yet to reveal an alternative.  “There is nothing in Zarlink’s circular that would lead us to conclude there is additional value in the company that was not understood by us, or the market, prior to our bid,” the company said.  Zarlink stock closed up 2.79 percent at C$3.69 in Toronto on Thursday.  The shares have lagged their peers, but analysts say a turnaround in its financial performance in the past three to four years, and a significant build-up in its medical business, are promising growth, making Zarlink more attractive to strategic buyers.  “The Microsemi offers are highly opportunistic,” Chowaniec said. “They come at an inflection point in Zarlink’s financial, technological and operational repositioning.”  Microsemi went hostile with a formal offer to shareholders on August 17, following its public proposal in July and unofficial talks with Zarlink that started in January.  The U.S. company has been an aggressive buyer in recent years, acquiring nine companies since 2009.

Microsemi, which has bought nine other companies since 2009, has offered C$3.35 a share for Ottawa-based Zarlink, and the bid expires September 22. Zarlink, a Canadian specialty chipmaker, says it has held talks with 15 potential suitors and that they will likely yield a higher offer.  “If they have a party that’s fully funded, they should really name the baby ... who is it?” Microsemi Chief Executive Jim Peterson told Reuters in an interview on Friday.  “At this point, come 22 September, in these market conditions I might take my fully funded money and go to what I call Plan B or Plan C and quite frankly, we’ll find out where it trades on the 23rd.”  Microsemi has been courting Zarlink since the beginning of the year, and at one point offered to pay as much as C$3.55 a share for the Ottawa-based designer of computer chips for communications and medical applications.  It made its interest in Zarlink public with a takeover proposal in July, and followed that with an official hostile bid on August 17.  Zarlink shares have consistently traded above the Microsemi bid, suggesting the market thinks a higher bid is likely.  “At C$3.35, this is a good company, and I’m here to tell you that it is not worth where it’s trading at today,” Peterson said.  “Here’s my open offer.

TI, which had already warned in July of a modest quarter, said on Thursday demand had weakened further across “a wide range of products, markets and customers.”   “Macroeconomic weakness is resulting in lower demand from consumers and enterprises,” Ron Slaymaker, TI’s head of investor relations, told analysts on a conference call.   He ruled out any inventory adjustments as a reason for slowing demand.   The executive noted that TI is cutting expenses such as variable compensation to stop profits from falling as quickly as sales. Because the shortfall is economy related, Slaymaker said he had no way of knowing when demand would improve.   “The only solace to take away from this is that it’s not TI specific,” said Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree who cited warnings about weak demand across the semiconductor industry.   Investors also took the news in their stride as rivals such as Fairchild Semiconductor FCS.N had already signaled a weak market by cutting its revenue guidance earlier this week. [ID:nL3E7K62AE]   Also on Thursday another technology company, Corning Inc (GLW.N), cut its forecast for glass demand, citing sluggish television sales. [ID:nL3E7K82A5]   Acree said he was encouraged by Slaymaker’s mention on the call that TI’s applications chips for cellphones were selling well despite the overall weak demand and competition from rivals such as Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O).   TI, which makes chips for products ranging from cellphones to cars, now expects quarterly earnings per share of 56 cents to 60 cents compared with its previous expectation for 55 cents to 65 cents.   It forecast revenue of $3.23 billion to $3.27 billion compared with its earlier target for $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion. The new forecasts missed Wall Street expectations for earnings of 59 cents per share on revenue of $3.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.   “It’s probably a bit lower than people were thinking,” said MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum. “Demand is slow.”   TI shares fell just 25 cents or just under 1 percent to $25.55 in extended trading after closing at $25.80 on the New York Stock Exchange. Its stock has already fallen about 18 percent since it reported its results in late July.

40,QCOM,Momentum grows for U.S. wireless spectrum bill,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington insiders have high hopes for legislation this year that would open up large swaths of spectrum to wireless companies desperate to meet the booming demand for data-heavy wireless devices.  Language giving the U.S. Federal Communications Commission authority to auction some airwaves currently held by TV broadcasters is popping up in bills in both chambers of Congress, as well as in President Barack Obama’s jobs plan.  Analysts say these incentive auctions, where some of the proceeds would go to the broadcasters giving up spectrum, are also likely to be part of the debate for the bipartisan congressional “super committee” tasked with slashing at least $1.2 trillion from the U.S. deficit over 10 years.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated auctions of TV spectrum would generate $24.5 billion, while Obama’s proposed jobs bill eyes some $28 billion in proceeds from the auctions.  “This is one of the rare instances where you see moving on an idea will actually generate revenues for the Treasury,” said Rhod Shaw, executive director of the High Tech Spectrum Coalition that includes Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Nokia Corp NOK1V.HE, Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and Qualcomm Inc  (QCOM.O).  “The issue now becomes what is the final deal ... And I think there is a reason to believe this can actually get done.”  The need for a national, common communications system for first responders has added momentum to the debate.  First responders still cannot easily talk to emergency personnel outside of their division or unit a decade after airliners hijacked by al Qaeda operatives killed nearly 3,000 people.  “Shame on the Congress,” Representative Anna Eshoo, the top Democrat on the House Communications and Technology Subcommittee, told Reuters last week.  Auction proceeds not set aside for TV broadcasters giving up spectrum would help fund the construction and maintenance of a wireless public safety network. Any money left over after that would go toward reducing the U.S. budget deficit.  Although they failed to pass a bill before the symbolic September 11 date, Democrats say the momentum is there to get a bill signed this year.  Eshoo said she is hopeful her subcommittee is on the threshold of introducing bipartisan legislation for a nationwide broadband network for first responders.  Republicans are also keen to usher in improved communications capabilities for emergency personnel while generating revenue for deficit reduction.  “The nice thing is this discussion has not been should we do incentive auctions, it’s now how do we do incentive auctions,” said David Redl, counsel for the Republican-led House Energy and Commerce Committee.  Still, much of the talk about incentive auction authority is tied to the public safety network and lawmakers remain split on fundamental elements of its build-out.  Of particular contention is how to handle 10 megahertz of highly sought after airwaves called the D Block, which will provide the infrastructure for the network.  Generally, Democrats want to allocate the airwaves to public safety, while Republicans want to see it auctioned to a wireless company who would be required to give first responders priority access on its network during emergencies.  “It won’t be easy to come to a meeting-of-the-minds because you’re coming up on an election year,” said Medley Global Advisors analyst Jeffrey Silva.  But the revenue-generating potential of the auctions, coupled with the super committee’s need to find trillions of dollars in savings, left Silva believing there is a “decent chance” of passing public safety and incentive auction legislation this year.  “It’s a very powerful legislative vehicle for that legislation to ride on,” Silva added.

Republicans are also keen to usher in improved communications capabilities for emergency personnel while generating revenue for deficit reduction.   “The nice thing is this discussion has not been should we do incentive auctions, it’s now how do we do incentive auctions,” said David Redl, counsel for the Republican-led House Energy and Commerce Committee.   Still, much of the talk about incentive auction authority is tied to the public safety network and lawmakers remain split on fundamental elements of its build-out.   Of particular contention is how to handle 10 megahertz of highly sought after airwaves called the D Block, which will provide the infrastructure for the network.   Generally, Democrats want to allocate the airwaves to public safety, while Republicans want to see it auctioned to a wireless company who would be required to give first responders priority access on its network during emergencies.   “It won’t be easy to come to a meeting-of-the-minds because you’re coming up on an election year,” said Medley Global Advisors analyst Jeffrey Silva.   But the revenue-generating potential of the auctions, coupled with the super committee’s need to find trillions of dollars in savings, left Silva believing there is a “decent chance” of passing public safety and incentive auction legislation this year.   “It’s a very powerful legislative vehicle for that legislation to ride on,” Silva added.

43,QCOM,Tech start-up targets emerging corporate mobile mkt," HELSINKI, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Venture capital-backed telecom gear startup SpiderCloud Wireless aims to tap into the emerging market of small wireless networks which can be used inside offices, shopping centers and stadiums.	   Telecom operators around the world are struggling with a shortage of network capacity as the use of video on smartphones and tablets proliferates, and are seeking new solutions to the issue.	   Many of them have added new sites to manage the growing problem, but the technology just for a large base station can cost up to 40,000 euros ($55,000), while site and tower costs in towns could be much larger.	   By comparison a basic small cellsite costs as little as $100. Such sites can then by linked together with SpiderCloud’s technology, to be rolled out later on Monday,  replacing the need to buy additional large base stations.	   “We are seeing growing demand for ultra cheap, operator owned and managed small cell solutions for creating high speed mobile data coverage and capacity in enterprise environments,” said Pal Zarandy, a partner at Helsinki-based consultancy Rewheel, which advises operators on data strategy.	   Research firm Mobile Experts has forecast the market for such small cells to reach 7 million units in 2013 and grow to 15.5 million by 2016. 	   “There is a huge macro trend towards smaller cells,” said  Mike Gallagher, chief executive of SpiderCloud. “We can build a very big franchise here.”	   Analysts said the demand for solutions like SpiderCloud’s was growing, but warned it could still be a tough sell to large operators.	   “It would fit the job, but getting operators to buy in on it is still tough,” said Earl Lum, founder of research firm EJL Wireless.	   SpiderCloud said it was working with a few major operators already, but declined to give any names.	   CEO Gallagher is a former president of Flarion Technologies, which was sold to Qualcomm for $600 million in 2006, and has worked for several technology firms which have been sold over the years to bigger players like Nortel Networks.	   SpiderCloud is trying to find a niche in a market dominated by major firms like Ericsson (ERICb.ST), Nokia Siemens Networks  , Huawei and Alcatel-Lucent , but Gallagher said there was no plan for quick sale.   “It would be nice to take one public,” said Gallagher.	   Founded in 2008, SpiderCloud Wireless has raised around $70 million from Charles River Ventures, Matrix Partners, Opus Capital and Shasta Ventures.

45,QCOM,Zarlink accepts sweetened Microsemi takeover bid,"(Reuters) - Microsemi Corp (MSCC.O) has reached a friendly agreement to buy Canadian specialty chipmaker Zarlink Semiconductor Inc ZL.TO, ending a hostile standoff with a sweetened deal worth $632 million that will bolster Microsemi’s medical technology product portfolio.  California-based Microsemi, which had courted Zarlink since January, said it will pay C$3.98 for each Zarlink share, or 19 percent more than its earlier C$3.35 bid, which Zarlink had rejected.  The total transaction value is $525 million, net of Zarlink’s cash of $107 million, Microsemi said.  After the announcement, Zarlink shares jumped 14 percent at the market open to C$3.94. The stock had hit a one-year low of C$1.55 last November, and in March 2009 it was worth just 21 Canadian cents.  Ottawa-based Zarlink designs mixed-signal chip technology for communications and medical applications, a sector that is widely viewed as poised for strong growth in an otherwise largely consolidated semiconductor industry.  The deal helps Microsemi diversify its revenue stream, almost 40 percent of which comes from the defense market, said Tore Svanberg, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.  “There is a lot of nervousness about defense budgets and things like that, so longer term, I think Microsemi is just trying to be prudent,” he said.  Several industry giants are either involved in or entering the medical device technology area, including Intel (INTC.O), Texas Instruments TXN.N, Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI.O).  “I expected a higher bid, I just expected it to come from somebody else,” said BMO Capital Markets analyst Brian Piccioni.  Before reaching the friendly deal with Microsemi, Zarlink said it had talked to at least 15 other potential suitors interested in buying the company in its entirety or in part.  But Zarlink never said which companies it was talking to, and Microsemi had not been expected to raise its bid unless another, higher offer surfaced.  “Entering the process and performing diligence enabled us to confirm the compelling strategic fit between the two companies,” Microsemi Chief Executive Jim Peterson said in announcing the deal on Thursday.  Under the terms of the deal, Microsemi agreed to pay C$1,624.49 per C$1,000 principal amount of debentures, also a 19 percent increase over an earlier offer.  Zarlink was not available for immediate comment.  “I think that most shareholders will be quite pleased with the turn of events,” Piccioni said.

The new iPhone, which goes on sale Friday at 8 a.m. in seven countries, looks similar to the previous iPhone 4 but has new hardware, including a faster processor, better camera and a voice-activated personal assistant feature dubbed “Siri” that has been well-reviewed. The phone, which sold over a million in pre-orders during the first 24 hours it was on sale, is expected to draw the usual throngs eager to grab a piece of the final gadget unveiled during Steve Jobs’ lifetime. The companies that supplied parts for the new phone include TriQuint , Skyworks Solutions and Avago Technologies Inc , according to iFixit, famous for stripping down and revealing the innards of Apple devices. Supplying major parts for Apple’s iPhones and iPads, the industry’s gold standards, is considered a coup for any company. Apple doesn’t disclose which company makes the components that go into its smartphones, and suppliers — including Toshiba, Infineon and Broadcom — in previous versions kept quiet for fear of angering the company. But analysts and industry experts had expected Qualcomm, Avago and Skyworks to be among the suppliers for the latest version. Shares of TriQuint were up 25 percent in late afternoon trading on Nasdaq after iFixit revealed that it was a supplier to Apple’s new phone. Shares of Skyworks rose 3 percent while shares of Avago were up 1 percent. Qualcomm shares were up 2 percent. The Qualcomm chipset is an upgrade from the one used in the previous version of the phone while Toshiba Corp  supplied the NAND flash memory for the phone, iFixit said. Among the other suppliers not confirmed in iFixit’s teardown were Samsung and LG for displays, Texas Instruments for touchscreen controllers, Sharp and LG Innotek for camera modules and Broadcom for wireless-bluetooth chips. Micron , which made its appearance in the iPhone 4 after buying Numonyx, was also not confirmed. There can be multiple suppliers even for one type of component, experts say. Teardown firms are hired by an array of clients, their data used for competitive intelligence, in patent disputes or to keep current on industry benchmarks. Investors also rely on the likes of iFixit and iSuppli to crack open Apple devices to reveal suppliers and component prices. Such news can boost the shares of a component maker, particularly one new to the device.

Some of the other chipmakers identified include Skyworks Solutions and Avago Technologies Inc, which has a power amplifier chip in the phone. Shares of Skyworks and Avago rose over 1 percent and nearly 3 percent, respectively, on the news. Shares of TriQuint, which makes radio chips for wireless communication, rose nearly 20 percent after an iFixit photo of the internal parts of the iPhone 4S appeared to show two chips with TriQuint’s name on it.

56,QCOM,Qualcomm upbeat for 2012 on mobile devices,"(Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc forecast double-digit sales growth this fiscal year, banking on continued strong demand for smartphones and mobile devices as its quarterly results beat Wall Street estimates. San Diego based Qualcomm makes chips for a number of mobile devices, including Apple Inc’s newest iPhone, which has seen record sales since its launch last month and helped to boost Qualcomm’s earnings in the past quarter. Chief executive Paul Jacobs said on Wednesday he anticipated demand for smartphones and tablets to remain strong and said the company would also benefit from further expansion of data network technology in emerging countries. The mobile chip maker estimated full-year revenue of $18 billion to $19 billion, an increase of 20 to 27 percent from a year ago, and 7 percent to 13 percent growth in earnings per share. For the current quarter and holiday shopping season, it expects sales to jump 30 percent to 42 percent. By comparison, rivals Broadcom Corp and Texas Instruments Inc both warned last month that revenue could slip on weaker demand this quarter. However, while Broadcom also makes chips for Apple products and other cellphone makers, it has a larger exposure to the declining PC market as does Texas Instruments. Analysts welcomed Qualcomm’s outlook saying there was little not to like. “They really don’t have any PC exposure and they have been picking up some market share, plus they are benefiting from a pickup in Apple and Nokia,” said Aalok Shah D.A. Davidson & Co. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co’s Stacy Rasgon said Qualcomm was “baking in some economic uncertainty ... but to have them guide this way is good.” Qualcomm said on a conference call with analysts that consumers would likely hang on to their phones longer before replacing them in countries where GDP growth was lower and that the company had factored in that the global economy was a little weaker. Qualcomm, which also makes money off licensing royalties for its chip patents, posted fourth quarter net earnings of $1.06 billion, or 0.62 cents per share, compared with $865 million, or 53 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue in its fourth quarter, which ended September 30, rose 39 percent to $4.12 billion, compared with Wall Street expectations for almost $4 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

61,QCOM,Qualcomm keeps long-term growth target,"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Wednesday affirmed its long-term growth target of at least 10 percent for annual revenue and earnings per share, citing strong demand for smartphones and other wireless devices. The target for “double-digit” growth, first announced in 2010, is good through 2015, Chief Financial Officer Bill Keitel said at the chip maker’s annual meeting with Wall Street analysts. The guidance implies stronger growth for the company’s chip business than its wireless technology licenses, he added. Strong demand in emerging markets such as China would help the company offset more sluggish growth in longer-established regions with economic worries such as Europe and the United States, Keitel said. San Diego-based Qualcomm, which competes with companies such as Texas Instruments Inc and Broadcom Corp, is hoping to benefit from the increasing popularity of devices such as tablet computers. Because most people already have cellphones Keitel noted that growth in that market is heavily dependent on consumers trading in their handsets for newer models. He said he expects the overall phone replacement rate to remain around 34 percent in 2012, similar to 2011. On November 2 Qualcomm reported stronger than expected quarterly results and gave an upbeat forecast for its current fiscal year. Revenue for its fourth quarter ended September 30 was $4.12 billion.

64,QCOM,Qualcomm wins first deal for new screens,"(Reuters) - Qualcomm has won a first deal for its new Mirasol display technology by supplying the South Korean Kyobo Book Center’s new e-reader. Qualcomm, the world’s largest wireless chip maker, has said the new technology would be key to reducing battery drain in smartphones, which have increasingly high power requirements as consumers use them for Web surfing or watching videos. Qualcomm and Kyobo said on Tuesday the Kyobo e-Reader, featuring a 5.7 inches Mirasol display, allows for weeks of reading without charging under typical usage. “This is a very important validation point for Qualcomm. It shows that there are volume categories that Mirasol can address,” said CCS Insight analyst John Jackson. Qualcomm said earlier this month its Mirasol division — its entry to the display industry — would incur an operating loss of more than $300 million for its fiscal year 2012 as it ramps up production. Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree said that it was good news that the company was able to announce a customer and that the product should see a lot of demand as consumers turn increasingly to devices like tablet computers and e-readers. “It’s obviously a high growth market and it’s a very large market. The only question is that it’s a fairly fluid market,” he said. “There are a lot of R&D; efforts in display. There are very good efforts out there today.” Qualcomm’s display technology rivals include Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Corning Corp.

65,QCOM,UPDATE 2-Imagination Technologies boosted by new licensees,"* H1 profit up 52 pct to 15.3 mln stg * New licensees include Qualcomm for display tech * Remains confident of continued good progress * Shares up 13 pct By Paul Sandle LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - British graphics chip designer Imagination Technologies posted a jump in first-half profit, boosted by strong sales of smartphones like Apple’s iPhone and wider licensing of its technology, including to new customer Qualcomm. Chief Financial Officer Richard Smith said the firm’s graphics, video and display technologies were increasingly in demand in feature-packed handsets and other connected devices. “Mobile phones, and smartphones in particular, is our main market, but we are also seeing good growth in tablets, personal media players, digital radio and even automotive markets as well,” he said in an interview on Tuesday. The company reported an adjusted pretax profit of 15.3 million pounds ($23.9 million) on revenues 28 percent higher at 56.3 million pounds. Its shares, which have risen more than 50 percent since touching a 12-month low of 285 pence in August, were 13.3 percent higher at 495 pence by 0930 GMT. JP Morgan Cazenove said Imagination was “chugging along the high growth path, getting important new licensees on the way”. The bank said licence revenue, up 65 percent year-on-year, was ahead of consensus, and while royalty revenue growth was hit by the timing of product launches such as Amazon’s Kindle and the iPhone 4S, it was more than compensated by a 18 percent rise in royalty per device to $0.31. Jefferies analyst Lee Simpson said it was “a strong set of numbers fortified by the news that Qualcomm is on board”. Smith said customers were shipping chips carrying more and more of its higher-priced technology. “They can take graphics, they can take graphics and/or video, they can take our display technologies, and we find they are taking an increasing number of technologies in each unit that they ship,” he said. Licensing was particularly strong in the half, Smith said, with new deals signed with existing partners Sony, Intel and Samsung, and new customers including MStar, and Qualcomm, the world’s largest wireless chip maker, which is taking its display technology. Imagination, which also owns the “PURE” digital radio brand, said it was confident of its continued progress despite the on-going challenges to the global economy, due to its licensing prospects, growth in design wins and momentum in chip volumes. Some 123 million chips containing its technology were shipped by its partners in the six months to end-October, up from 107 million a year earlier, it said. Reported pretax profit of 10.4 million pounds beat analysts’ forecasts of 10.1 million pounds, according to a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll.

But as with most years, avid - and hardy - attendees can always find a few gems that stand out from the inevitable tidal wave of headphones, Internet-enabled home appliances and gadget casings.

A minute GPS unit clipped to pet collars will send an alarm text or email to your app-installed smartphone should Snuggles wander outside of a prescribed zone. - Hewlett-Packard’s all-glass-encased Spectre was probably the most eye-catching of the so-called ‘Ultrabooks’ and drew throngs of onlookers. Intel is hoping the new generation of ultra-thin, instant-on, lightweight laptops - essentially a riposte to Apple’s MacBook Air - will safeguard its market share as tablets and smartphones encroach on its traditional personal-computing turf. - The Tobii, which tracks eye movements to execute commands - what it calls “gaze interaction” - taking gesture-controlled interfaces a step further and upping the sophistication ante. Along with Nuance’s voice controls and Microsoft’s Kinect gesture-recognition technology, it offers an alternative to the fast-getting-old keyboard-mouse input model in an era of touchscreens. Zoom, auto-center, destroy virtual asteroids - moving just your eyes. - Samsung Note, the beefed up “phablet” with a 5.3 inch screen that sits somewhere between a phone and a tablet. It may seem unwieldy held up to one’s ear, and the screen - at half the iPad’s size - might seem wanting as well, but its sleek lines, pin-sharp Android apps and unique shape drew in the crowds. - Nokia’s Lumia 900 phone, running Windows, marked the once-mighty Finnish handset maker’s return to the U.S. market - and Microsoft’s biggest phone gambit yet. People clamored for a feel, but demos were limited and there is no release date yet. - Massive, 55-inch “OLED” TVs from Samsung and LG, which are both cautiously hopeful the costlier, but crisper screens will re-energize a faltering global TV market after flat sales in 2011. Bonus: look at them sideways and they almost disappear. Misses: - Microsoft Corp signed off after 14 show-opening keynotes with a bizarre, news-free presentation featuring a “Twitter choir” and a Q&A; anchored by Ryan Seacrest. The company is reportedly revamping its marketing organization. - Panasonic Corp’s combo digital photo frame and Skype terminal. “The idea of some engineer who has been locked in a room for 10 years,” one observer quipped. - Dish Network Corp's stunt with a fidgety live kangaroo onstage, to launch its new ""Hopper"" package. For a video, click here - A Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s fridge that streams Pandora and Twitter. It’s OK to take a break from the Internet every now and then. - And last but not least: Sony Corp’s strange “Wedding Invitation” promo for its Internet-enabled TVs.

83,QCOM,"UPDATE 3-Dissected iPad reveals Samsung, Qualcomm parts","* Teardowns a key glimpse into Apple supply chain * Qualcomm supplies LTE * Memory from Elpida, Toshiba By Noel Randewich and Poornima Gupta SAN FRANCISCO, March 15 (Reuters) - Apple’s  new iPad uses chips made by Qualcomm, Broadcom , Samsung Electronics and other semiconductor makers, according to a firm that cracked open one of the devices. The newest iPad went on sale in Australia early on Friday, and at the front of a line of fans hoping to get hold of the 4G-ready tablet computer was a tinkerer from California gadget-repair firm iFixit, who quickly took one apart for a Web blog. Supplying parts for Apple’s iPhones and iPads, the industry’s gold standards, is considered a coup for chipmakers and other manufacturers. The iPad includes a Qualcomm LTE cellphone chip as well as a Qualcomm wireless modem for 3G and 4G. Broadcom supplies a semiconductor handling wireless tasks like WiFi and Bluetooth, according to iFixit. Fueled by cans of carbonated caffeine drinks, iFixit cofounder Luke Soules’ before-dawn teardown at a Melbourne computer shop found that Apple suppliers Qualcomm, Broadcom and Samsung have maintained their key roles in the newest iPad. The iPad’s new A5X application processor, with improved graphics horsepower, is based on energy-efficient technology licensed from Britain’s ARM Holding and is manufactured by Qualcomm, as in past Apple devices. Apple doesn’t disclose which company makes the components that go into its smartphones, and insists its suppliers keep quiet. Analysts recommend caution in drawing conclusions from the teardowns because Cupertino, California-based Apple sometimes uses more than one supplier for a part. What is found in one iPad may not be found in others. Still, teardowns remain a key source of information for investors interested in betting on Apple’s suppliers, and the appearance of unexpected chips can move stocks. “There are a whole lot of hedge funds out there that like to shoot first and ask questions later,” said Alex Gauna, an analyst at JMP who covers technology stocks. The third-generation iPad from Apple - which sports a high-definition “retina” display and comes with a better camera - is capable of operating on high-speed 4G “LTE”. A source familiar with the device’s components told Reuters this week that Samsung and LG Electronics will both supply their liquid crystal displays for the iPad. iFixit said the iPad’s display, removed using two bright orange suction cups, appears to be from Samsung. A NAND flash memory chip, used to store media like music and video, is supplied by Toshiba. Japan’s Elpida  provides the DRAM chips. The iPad teardown also revealed chips from Avago Technologies, Triquint Semiconductor and Fairchild.

84,QCOM,WRAPUP 2-Apple touches record high as iPad 3 sales run hot,"* Shares hit record soon after first iPad sold * Teardown shows same key suppliers as for earlier model * New iPad seen as series or improvements, not major innovation By Lee Chyen Yee and Pauline Askin HONG KONG/SYDNEY, March 16 (Reuters) - Apple’s  new iPad proved to be another hot-seller on Friday, with hundreds queueing at stores across Asia to be the first to get their hands on the 4G-ready tablet computer as the company’s share price hit $600 for the first time. As consumers lined up around city streets to buy the iPad, one firm that took the new device apart said Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Samsung Electronics had all held onto their prized roles as key parts suppliers. David Tarasenko, a 34-year-old construction manager who was the first to pick up the iPad from a Telstra store at midnight in Sydney, said ever since Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook revealed the tablet’s third iteration, he couldn’t wait to get one. “When Tim Cook announced it, it sounded like such a magical tool. I just got hyped into it, I guess,” he said. The new iPad is a progressive development of Apple’s tablet, with a more powerful CPU and screen and better camera. It was not marketed as a revolutionary product like earlier versions, yet Apple devotees still snapped up the latest version. “The iPad is already a pretty mature product and it’s hard to revolutionise it any further,” said Dickie Chang, an analyst with research firm IDC based in Hong Kong. “It’s slightly heavier than its predecessors and I think Asian consumers will be more concerned about that,” he said. “Going ahead, with Tim Cook at the helm now, I think he may have to come up with another product to mark his stamp. That could come in the form of launching a smaller iPad with a longer battery life, for instance.” Crowds were down on previous Apple launches, but there was still excitement as stores opened. “I’ve got the first one and I skipped the second one. This is a big difference from the first one. The processing speed, memory, graphical capabilities and everything like that,” said Michael Kelly in Sydney. The buzz helped propel Apple shares to record highs in U.S. trade on Thursday, with Apple stock touching a high of $600.01 before easing back. It peaked half an hour after the first iPad went on sale in Australia, extending the market worth of the world’s most valuable company to almost $560 billion. Only a month earlier, the stock price had crossed $500 for the first time. The stock has jumped 45 percent this year. At Thursday’s closing price of $585.56, the stock is far more expensive than the $499 starting price for a Wi-Fi iPad. The new iPad goes on sale on Friday in 10 countries, including the United States, Canada, Singapore, France and Britain, with diehards lining up overnight in front of Apple stores in Munich, Paris, London, Singapore and Hong Kong. “After this, well, I’ll first of all open it up and check it’s as beautiful as I thought. Then I’ll get some sleep,” said Shintaro Aizawa, 16, who waited 15 hours outside a Tokyo store. Just across the border from Hong Kong in the Chinese city of Shenzhen, people keen to get their hands on the new iPad had to wait for the tablet to be smuggled into mainland China. “We don’t have iPad 3s yet, but some will arrive later in the day when the students deliver them to us. We’ll have more supplies over this weekend,” said a store operator in Shenzhen. “Customs has become stricter, but if you take one at a time across the border, that’s still pretty safe. At most they’ll ask you to take it out of the box to prove that it’s for self use.” Wall Street expects a strong start for the latest iPad and some analysts even expect sales of the current model to overtake the iPad 2.  Apple will continue to sell the iPad 2 but dropped its price by $100 to start at $399. Apple may sell 65.6 million iPads, according to an estimate by Canaccord Genuity analysts who also raised their target price on Apple stock to $710 from $665. So far, the company has sold 55 million iPads since it was launched in 2010. Tablet sales are expected to increase to 326 million by 2015 with Apple largely dominating the market, according to research firm Gartner. The iPad competes with Samsung Electronic’s Galaxy and Motorola’s Xyboard, among others. The third-generation iPad is seen more as a collection of incremental improvements, such as a high-definition “retina” display and a better camera, rather than a major innovation. The inner workings of the iPad are similar to previous models, based on a “teardown” by a tinkerer from California gadget-repair firm iFixit, who queued up in Australia to get one of the new tablets and quickly took it apart for a Web blog. iFixit cofounder Luke Soules’ pre-dawn teardown at a Melbourne computer shop found Apple suppliers Qualcomm, Broadcom and Samsung had maintained their key roles in the newest iPad. The iPad includes a Qualcomm LTE cellphone chip and a Qualcomm wireless modem for 3G and 4G. Broadcom supplies a semiconductor handling wireless tasks like WiFi and Bluetooth, according to iFixit. The iPad’s new A5X application processor, with improved graphics horsepower, is based on energy-efficient technology licensed from Britain’s ARM Holding and is manufactured by Qualcomm, as in past Apple devices. Supplying parts for Apple’s iPhones and iPads, the industry’s gold standards, is considered a coup for chipmakers and other manufacturers.

86,QCOM,Qualcomm supply constraints to limit revenue,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) warned on Wednesday that it will have trouble meeting demand for some of its advance cellphone chips for the rest of the year due to manufacturing constraints and that will increase operating expenses faster than expected. While the leading mobile phone chip maker maintained its previous revenue outlook for its fiscal year 2012, its shares fell 3 percent as investors had hoped it would be able to raise its targets. “At this stage we cannot secure enough supply to meet the increasing demand we are experiencing,” Chief Executive Paul Jacobs told analysts on a conference call, adding that the issue would limit revenue growth this year. The San Diego-based company not see a significant improvement in supply until the December quarter as it will take a few quarters to get up and running with new suppliers for the cutting edge 28 nanometer chip manufacturing technology along with TSMC (2330.TW), the world’s top contract chipmaker. Chief Financial Officer Bill Keitel said he is now planning for a 23 percent increase in operating expenses this year, up from the 18 percent rise he forecast three months ago mostly because Qualcomm is looking to alternative suppliers. The shortage is costing “tens of millions” extra, he said. “Demand went so far ahead of availability that we’ve decided to start spending more money to get more supply as soon as possible,” he told Reuters. “Any time we can’t make a customer totally happy I’m going to worry. You don’t want to give a customer a reason to go elsewhere.” However, Keitel noted that rivals are also complaining about 28 nanometer shortages. Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) last month warmed of delays in ramping up of the new manufacturing technology. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said Qualcomm’s forecast for third quarter chip shipments of 144 million to 152 million also fell below his expectation for 157 million. But while investors were disappointed by the current quarter numbers, they were relieved that the problem is not related to any weakening in end-customer demand, analysts said. “Given that it’s supply related and not demand related the shares will rally back,” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley, who expects a “nice recovery” for Qualcomm by the end of the calendar year 2012. However, since the chips that are in short supply are used for the latest high-speed cellphones based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology Bernstein’s Rasgon said it could lead to a slowdown in the roll out of the most advanced LTE phones. For example, analysts widely expect Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to come up with its first LTE phone later this year. Rasgon would not comment on Apple specifically but said the supply shortage could hurt LTE progress in general. “There are implications here,” the analyst said. Qualcomm kept its target for full-year revenue even as it raised its earnings per share forecast to a range of $3.61 to 3.76 from its previous range of $3.55 to $3.75. Keitel would not give an estimate as to how much extra revenue and earnings the company was missing out on because of the constraints. The company posted a profit of $2.23 billion or $1.28 per diluted share for its second fiscal quarter ended March 25, compared with $999 million or 59 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Qualcomm said revenue rose 28 percent to $4.94 billion from $3.87 billion in the year ago quarter and handily beat Wall Street expectations for $4.84 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Qualcomm shares fell to $64.74 in late trade after closing at $66.98 on Nasdaq. ",4182012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm/qualcomm-supply-constraints-to-limit-revenue-idUSBRE83H1B120120418

Macquarie downgraded Texas Instruments Inc to “neutral” from “outperform,” saying the company’s earnings power may be limited by the absence of organic share gains. The brokerage also cut its rating on Altera Corp  and Xilinx Inc to “neutral,” citing limited evidence of superior growth potential for programmable logic chips.

India typically grants radio airwaves for a period of 20 years. In Qualcomm’s case, the telecoms ministry cut the validity of the spectrum by 18 months and asked the company to roll out services in 3-1/2 years, compared with the five years given to other 4G winners, a source with direct knowledge said. The telecoms ministry, which initially rejected Qualcomm’s application for an internet service license needed to use 4G spectrum, agreed to grant the permit in October.

98,QCOM,Qualcomm restructures to help protect patents,"(Reuters) - Cellphone chip supplier Qualcomm Inc is changing its internal structure to protect its technology licensing business by creating a new subsidiary that will work on open source wireless developments. The biggest developer of cellphone chips also derives a huge amount of its revenue from selling licenses for use of its vast portfolio of technology patents to companies such as cellphone makers whether or not they use Qualcomm chips. The restructuring comes at a time when the wireless industry is beset with litigation related to technology patents. Under the new structure, Qualcomm Inc as the parent company, will include its technology licensing division and corporate functions as well as most of its patent portfolio. Qualcomm Technologies Inc (QTI), the new subsidiary, will include its research and development arm and its wireless chip business. Qualcomm said it needed to make the change to protect its patent licensing business because its new subsidiary QTI plans to increase its work with open source software. Open source projects typically involve the sharing of technology with the broader development community. While the parent company will keep most of Qualcomm’s patents, QTI will hold some patents that are specifically developed to provide open source software contributions. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said the move should not worry shareholders as it would not change Qualcomm’s finances. He saw it as a forward looking effort to protect the patent business which generates a much higher profit margin than Qualcomm’s chip business. “If they do see a risk that their patents could leak out as part of their open source efforts obviously this is good,” Rasgon said. Under the new structure, QTI will have no rights to grant licenses held by the parent company, Qualcomm said. Qualcomm said the restructuring was not aimed at spinning out either its chip business or its licensing business and nor was it in response to any third party actions. The company said the restructuring, which will be completed during the first fiscal quarter of 2013, will not change the way it reports its financial results. Qualcomm shares were down $1.01 or 1.83 percent at $53.90 in afternoon trade on Nasdaq.

102,QCOM,Brain tissue from former NFL star Seau to be studied for damage,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Tissue from the brain of former San Diego Chargers star Junior Seau, who committed suicide in May, has been sent to the National Institutes of Health for analysis amid growing concerns over the long-term effects of football-related head injuries. The brain sample was sent to the NIH, the U.S. government’s primary biomedical research institution, at the request of Seau’s family members, said Sarah Gordon, spokeswoman for the San Diego County Medical Examiner’s office. Gordon declined to comment further on the decision. The family’s pastor previously said family members were considering having Seau’s brain studied for evidence of football-related injuries. “The National Institutes of Health is not directly involved in an analysis of former NFL player Junior Seau’s cause of death, but physicians at NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke conduct research on traumatic brain injury and have agreed to carry out an analysis of the autopsied tissue,” the institutes said in a written statement. “In order to protect Mr. Seau’s children’s right to privacy, NIH will not discuss the status of the tissue or any subsequent findings,” the institutes said. Seau, a 20-year National Football League veteran and fan favorite widely regarded as one of the best defensive players of his generation, shot himself in the chest on May 2. He left no suicide note. His death at age 43 came during heightened scrutiny of the effects of repeated blows to the head in football, ice hockey and other contact sports and the potential for such injuries to contribute to depression and other health problems in players. It also marked at least the third suicide by a former NFL player since February 2011, when ex-Chicago Bears defensive back Dave Duerson, 50, killed himself with a gunshot to the chest after complaining of headaches, blurred vision and memory loss. Duerson left a note with the request: “Please, see that my brain is given to the NFL’s brain bank.” More than 2,000 former NFL players and spouses have sued the league, saying it deliberately concealed the risk of brain damage from repeated blows to the head suffered by players. The NFL has called the suit groundless, saying it has long made player safety a priority and calling attention to its benefits programs for former players. The league has focused in recent seasons on health and safety issues. It has cracked down on hits to the head and stiffened rules that bar players from using their helmets as a weapon through head-first contact, which is subject to fines and suspension for repeat offenders.

103,QCOM,"Qualcomm cuts outlook for current quarter, sees strong December","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) cut its revenue and earnings forecast for the current quarter on weaker-than-expected demand for semiconductors, but investors took heart as it said that sales would improve for a strong last quarter of 2012. Qualcomm shares rose 6 percent in late trade after the leading provider of chips for cellphones said it expects a “strong December quarter” as it will have overcome a shortfall in its advanced chip supply by year end. The San Diego-based company is expected to supply chips for the next Apple Inc (AAPL.O) iPhone model, which analysts widely expect to go on sale in time for the holiday shopping season. Qualcomm said it expects big smartphone launches to boost chip sales in the holidays despite a weaker economic outlook. It said that lower-than-expected sales in the current quarter would be mostly due to customers’ cutting inventory to prepare for new holiday product launches. “We think there’s a number of flagship devices that phone manufacturers will be launching. Like last year the consumer uptake was quite strong so we’re expecting a similar situation this coming December” Chief Financial Officer William Keitel told Reuters, but declined to name the phone makers. “They’re saying everything they can to point to Apple without saying Apple,” said Charter Equity Research analyst Ed Snyder. “People are looking past the current quarter into the holiday season and they like what they see.” Qualcomm also said it had made big progress in expanding its chip manufacturing capacity. The company warned in April that it would lose out on a lot of revenue as it was unable to meet demand for advanced chips due to a 28 nanometer manufacturing capacity shortfall at contract manufacturer TSMC (2330.TW). Keitel said that Qualcomm is now ramping up production of 28 nanometer chips with four different manufacturing companies. Analysts said this was good enough news that it distracted investors from the weakness in the current quarter. Investors also appeared to overlook Chief Executive Paul Jacob’s admission on a conference call that it had to inform U.S. regulators that it gave gifts or other benefits to people associated with state-owned companies or agencies in China. The finding was part of an investigation that Qualcomm says arose from a “whistleblower’s” allegations made in December 2009 to the company’s audit committee and regulators. Qualcomm said it believes the total monetary value of the benefits in question to be less than $250,000. Jacobs said he was unable to predict the outcome of the investigation. Qualcomm cut its revenue target for its fiscal full year 2012, which ends in September to a range of $18.7 billion to $19.1 billion from $18.7 billion to $19.7 billion. It cut its non-GAAP earnings per share target to a range of $3.61 to $3.67 from its prior target of $3.61 to $3.76. Another analyst, James Faucette of Pacific Crest Securities, said investors were brushing off the worse-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter outlook and focusing on the fact “that the ramp in 28 nanometer chips is happening.” Qualcomm posted a profit of $1.207 billion, or 69 cents per share for its second quarter ended June 24, compared with a profit of $1.035 billion or 61 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding certain items, Qualcomm earnings per share would have been 85 cents compared with Wall Street expectations of 86 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $4.63 billion from $3.62 billion, compared with analyst expectations of $4.677 billion. Qualcomm shares rose to $59.28 in late trade after closing at $56.05 in regular Nasdaq trade. The stock had fallen 16 percent from its $66.99 close on April 18 just before it warned of the 28 nanometer shortage.

The new company will develop and sell chips that control wireless communications and signals, while production will be outsourced, the Japanese daily said. Qualcomm is estimated to command 70 to 80 percent of the market for core microchips for smartphones, the daily added. The three Japanese firms aim to reduce their reliance on the U.S. firm and secure a stable supply through the venture, the Nikkei said. The venture will also help the companies to gain greater freedom in chip development and enable them to supply to other smartphone makers in the future, the report said. Access Network Technology will develop products for the LTE (Long Term Evolution) market and pursue next-generation high-speed technologies, the Nikkei added.

108,QCOM,UPDATE 1-Liberty Media unit mobile phone lawsuit can proceed-US judge,"* Liberty unit’s technology can locate emergency callers * Company says conspiracy kept technology out of 4G phones * US District judge refuses to dismiss lawsuit By Nate Raymond Aug 21 (Reuters) - A unit of Liberty Media Corp can proceed with its lawsuit against Ericsson, Qualcomm Inc and Alcatel-Lucent SA that accuses the three manufacturers of conspiring to exclude Liberty’s positioning technology from being adopted in 4G mobile phones, a judge decided on Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Robert Kelly in Philadelphia wrote that TruePosition Inc’s allegations of an illegal conspiracy “are plausible when viewed in context and as a whole”. TruePosition is a Liberty Media subsidiary that sells technology to assist carriers in locating mobile phones when someone calls the U.S. emergency number 911. The company accused Ericsson, Qualcomm and Alcatel-Lucent of hijacking the organizations that set global standards for what technologies would be included in LTE 4G networks. “Ericsson is in the process of reviewing the judge’s opinion,” said Kathy Egan, a spokeswoman for the company. “We have no additional comment at this time.” Roger Brooks, a lawyer for Qualcomm, said it was “unfortunate we will go through the expense of discovery, but we intend to prove there wasn’t any conspiracy and isn’t any substance to the complaint.” Charlie Guyer, a spokesman for Alcatel-Lucent, said it was company policy not to comment on pending litigation. A spokesman for TruePosition had no immediate comment. TruePosition filed the lawsuit in June 2011, citing what it called violations of federal antitrust laws. The lawsuit accused the companies of seeking to block TruePosition’s technology from being adopted in the future LTE 4G wireless networks to gain an advantage for their own location technologies. In January, Kelly dismissed an earlier version of the lawsuit but allowed TruePosition to file an amended complaint. In his decision on Tuesday, Kelly said TruePosition had failed to establish direct evidence of an agreement to prevent standardization of its technologies. But the judge said TruePosition had adequately claimed circumstantial evidence. The case is TruePosition, Inc. V.

109,QCOM,"""Intel Inside"" ignites mobile branding war","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As the mobile computing wars heat up, chipmakers that supply the crucial components inside smartphones and tablets aim to grab more of the glory. Not content to remain in the shadows of hot consumer brands like Apple or Samsung, chipmakers - including Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia - want consumers to get to know the processors that power their mobile devices. They hope to build brand loyalty in the process. Intel is leading the charge by extending its hugely successful “Intel Inside” marketing campaign beyond personal computers. Launched in 1991, “Intel Inside” stickers turned commodity electronic components into premium products, and eventually became ubiquitous on laptops. This year, the Intel Inside logo has appeared on the backs of smartphones launched in the United Kingdom, India and Russia. Intel hopes to bring the phone campaign to the United States next year, seeking a marketing advantage over rivals like Qualcomm and Nvidia, which are not as well-known among consumers. “Without a doubt, my goal would be to have consumers walk into stores and have Intel Inside as a key driver of which phone or tablet they choose, just like we’ve done in the PC space,” said Brian Fravel, Intel’s head of branding. The world’s top chipmaker dominates the PC market but lags smaller competitors in the fast-growing mobile industry. Intel is flexing its branding muscle to try to catch up. It remains to be seen how many handset manufacturers agree to put the Intel Inside logo on their devices. For emerging smartphone brands, with little name recognition of their own, partnering with Intel may be a “no brainer.” At the other extreme, Apple refuses to share branding with any of its suppliers. The highest-profile smartphone maker so far to use Intel’s branding is Google’s Motorola Mobility, which launched the Razr i in London on Sept 18. Until now, space on most smartphones has been reserved for the vendor, such as Apple or Samsung, and carriers like Verizon Wireless. Providers of operating systems, such as Google’s Android, also covet consumer loyalty - their logos sometimes appear briefly on screens when devices are turned on. A logo-happy approach to smartphones and tablets, though, would run the risk of confusing consumers with what some experts call the NASCAR effect. As a rule, it’s seen as a good idea to add extra branding to products only when the additional brand strongly conveys a quality that the handset maker’s own brand lacks. “Can you generate end-user demand for your processors? That’s what they’re all looking at, and that’s not an easy thing to do in the mobile space where people aren’t accustomed to it,” said Jack Gold, a tech industry analyst at J. Gold Associates. Part of the reason the Intel Inside campaign has been unrivaled in the chip industry is that no one else can match Intel’s $2.1 billion annual budget for advertising and marketing. Intel helps pay for the PC makers’ own ads, as long as they include Intel Inside. A TV ad promoting a phone launched by Orange in the United Kingdom in February features a supersonic car driven by a dark-clad pilot whose clothes are emblazoned with Intel Inside. Intel surveyed customers who bought Orange’s phone. “It wasn’t as though these were tech-savvy people who were reading all the benchmarks. They said Intel Inside meant performance to them,” Intel’s Fravel said. Badly underestimating how quickly the mobile market would grow, Intel was slow to develop application processors, the punchy but energy-efficient chips that drive web surfing, games and other advanced features of smartphones and tablets. Along with Qualcomm, Samsung is a major producer of mobile processors, most of which it manufactures on behalf of Apple’s iPads and iPhones. Texas Instruments and Broadcom also make mobile processors, but do not advertise much to consumers. Since the 1990s, Qualcomm has been a major player in the mobile chip industry. For most of that time, advertising has been an afterthought for the San Diego-based company. Most of Qualcomm’s marketing has been directed at a specific category of tech enthusiasts keenly interested in the components used in their devices. It has taken the form of YouTube videos, Internet ads and social media instead of TV commercials and other pricey campaigns. In October, Qualcomm is set to start a new branding campaign, coinciding with the launch of tablets and other devices using its chips and Microsoft’s next-generation Windows platform. As part of the drive, Qualcomm will share advertising with manufacturers to showcase features of its chips, said Tim McDonough, a Qualcomm vice president responsible for marketing the company’s Snapdragon mobile processors. “You’ll start to see the Snapdragon brand appearing in a lot more places. But the key is having it appear in places where it has value to the user as a starting point. Right now, the consumer is saying, ‘I’m ready for my next phone, I’m not sure what to buy, and I need some help,’” McDonough said, in a telephone interview. McDonough would not say how much Qualcomm plans to spend on advertising to counter Intel, which last year even paid hit Korean pop group Girls’ Generation for TV ads and a single written for Intel. Signaling its growing interest in creating brand awareness, Qualcomm renamed a professional football venue in San Diego “Snapdragon Stadium” for a few days last year. And suggesting Qualcomm sees the PC industry as a model for its marketing, it hired a new chief marketing officer, Anand Chandrasekher, a veteran Intel senior executive, in August. As much smaller Nvidia transitions to the mobile market, it aims to capitalize on game enthusiasts who are passionate about its PC graphics chips. Its well-oiled marketing department hosts tournaments and aggressively interacts with industry pundits. Last year, Nvidia spent just $9.5 million on advertising, a sum that can’t buy anything close to Intel’s broad recognition. But it can help win loyalty from a narrow but influential group of young men. “Intel spends way more money branding Intel Inside, but we’ll go to events, and gamers will come up to us with the Nvidia logo tattooed on their body, shaved on their head,” said Ujesh Desai, Nvidia’s vice president of corporate marketing. Leveraging its popularity with game fans, Nvidia has created Tegra Zone, a collection of games optimized to work better on mobile devices using Nvidia’s Tegra processors. Ads for tablets like Google’s Nexus 7 boast of Nvidia’s punchy graphics. “Our tack doesn’t start with, ‘How much are we going to pay you so you put our logo on there?’ Our tack is more, ‘Here’s how we can partner with you so we can create a great experience,’” Desai said. With stagnant PC sales, executives see mobile gadgets as the future. Annual sales of processors used in smartphones and tablets could hit $25 billion by 2016, compared with $9 billion last year, according to market research firm Strategy Analytics. As formidable as the Intel Inside brand may be, extending it from PCs to a new world of smartphones and tablets has risks. Competition in mobile is fierce. If Intel fails to deliver the top performance that people associate with “Intel Inside,” the chipmaker could damage its prized image. “Putting an ingredient brand on the outside of your product should be like driving a sports car, something you want people to see you do because it’s better,” said Andy Smith, a former Intel employee who was involved with the “Intel Inside” campaign in the late 1990s. “But if the reality is that there’s nothing great about the chips, then it’s going to be hard for them to repeat it.” ",9242012,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-technology-chips-marketing/intel-inside-ignites-mobile-branding-war-idUSBRE88N08T20120924

112,QCOM,"Qualcomm revenue beats Street, shares rise","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) reported quarterly earnings and revenue that blew past Wall Street expectations as demand increased for chips in devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, sending its shares up more than 8 percent. The leading supplier of chips for cellphones also gave a bullish forecast for the current quarter and the year ahead, in stark contrast with bleak outlooks from other chip companies. San Diego, California-based Qualcomm forecast first quarter revenue of $5.6 billion to $6.1 billion compared with Wall Street expectations for $5.6 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It forecast full-year 2013 revenue growth in a range of 20 percent to 26 percent from 2012. The company’s fourth-quarter sales were helped by the launch of the latest Apple Inc (AAPL.O) iPhone and other smartphones from Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS). “Clearly Apple is playing a part here, as is Samsung,” said Charter Equity Research analyst Ed Snyder. But he noted that the company was also helped this quarter by pent-up demand for its most advanced wireless chips as its revenue was stunted earlier this year by a shortage of 28 nanometer manufacturing capacity. “The question is if it’s a one-time shipment thing. How much of this was catch-up?” Snyder said. Qualcomm told analysts on a conference call that it was able to boost its 28 nanometer chip supply significantly in the fourth quarter and that it is on track for supply to match demand for these chips by the end of December. Chief Executive Paul Jacobs said the company is expecting strong growth in demand for its wireless chips “despite a somewhat cautious macroeconomic outlook.” “We believe our long-term growth drivers remain intact,” Jacobs told analysts on the conference call. “Smartphone adoption continues at a rapid pace with many increasingly capable devices at a variety of price points being launched on a global basis.” Qualcomm’s revenue rose 18 percent to $4.87 billion from $4.12 billion in the year-ago quarter and compared with Wall Street expectations for $4.66 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Qualcomm said profit for its fiscal fourth-quarter ended September 30 rose to $1.27 billion, or 73 cents per share, from $1.06 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding unusual items, Qualcomm earned 89 cents a share compared with Wall Street expectations for 82 cents according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Qualcomm estimated first quarter earnings of 90 to 98 cents a share. Shares of Qualcomm rose more than 8 percent to $62.95 in late trade after closing down almost 4 percent at $58.12 on Nasdaq.

Qualcomm told analysts on a conference call that it was able to boost its 28 nanometer chip supply significantly in the fourth quarter and that it is on track for supply to match demand for these chips by the end of December. Chief Executive Paul Jacobs said the company is expecting strong growth in demand for its wireless chips “despite a somewhat cautious macroeconomic outlook.” “We believe our long-term growth drivers remain intact,” Jacobs told analysts on the conference call. “Smartphone adoption continues at a rapid pace with many increasingly capable devices at a variety of price points being launched on a global basis.” Qualcomm’s revenue rose 18 percent to $4.87 billion from  $4.12 billion in the year-ago quarter and compared with Wall Street expectations for $4.66 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Qualcomm said profit for its fiscal fourth-quarter ended Sept. 30 rose to $1.27 billion, or 73 cents per share, from $1.06 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding unusual items, Qualcomm earned 89 cents a share compared with Wall Street expectations for 82 cents according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The leading supplier of chips for cell phones also gave a bullish forecast for the current quarter and the year ahead, in stark contrast to bleak outlooks from other chip companies such as Texas Instruments (TXN.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O). San Diego-based Qualcomm was helped by pent-up demand for its most advanced wireless chips after their sales were stunted earlier this year by a shortage of 28 nanometer manufacturing capacity. Fourth-quarter sales were also boosted by the launch of the latest iPhone at the end of the quarter and the popularity of smartphones from Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS). “Clearly Apple is playing a part here, as is Samsung,” said Charter Equity Research analyst Ed Snyder. However, Qualcomm, which is well ahead of rivals such as Broadcom Corp BRCM.O and Intel in developing chips for high-speed wireless devices, may start to see more pressure once its rivals bring out new products next year, Snyder said. Even though he expects Qualcomm to have better products than newer offerings from its rivals, it will still see price pressure as phone makers want more than one supplier, said Snyder, who is also worried about worsening global economic conditions. “I think this is the peak. The air will slowly come out of the balloon in the next couple of quarters,” he said. “The macro trends they’ve been able to buck they won’t be able to buck forever.” Qualcomm forecast first quarter revenue of $5.6 billion to $6.1 billion compared with Wall Street expectations for $5.6 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Qualcomm told analysts on a conference call that it was able to boost its 28 nanometer chip supply significantly in the fourth quarter and that it is on track for supply to match demand for these chips by the end of December.

120,QCOM,"Intel, Qualcomm may invest $378 million in Sharp: sources","TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S.-based Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc are in talks to jointly invest about 30 billion yen ($378 million) in debt-stricken Japanese consumer electronics maker Sharp Corp, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Details of the talks were not known, but Sharp, whose displays are used in Apple Inc’s iPads and iPhones, is looking to small displays to spark a revival in its fortunes and sees the new generation of high-end laptops as a fresh market. Intel, which has been promoting a new category of thin “Ultrabook” laptops with touch screens, has long been interested in Sharp’s power-saving IGZO displays, as it responds to a shift from PCs to smartphones and tablets. Sharp may reach an agreement as early as the end of this month with Qualcomm, said one of the sources, who asked not to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media, adding talks with Intel are less concrete amid the chipmaker’s unclear financial picture. Shares in Sharp jumped 11 percent on the news, but brokers said the rally was likely to be brief as the potential investment would do little to address the firm’s fundamental problems as it struggles with a TV business in retreat, aggressive competition and a $13.8 billion debt load, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Sharp has talked about cutting debt and inventory, but they haven’t made it clear how they plan to generate cash flow and strengthen their capital base,” said Toshiyuki Kanayama, senior market analyst at Monex Inc. Japan’s top LCD maker has been in talks for months with Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, which is considering becoming the century-old Japanese firm’s biggest shareholder, but has said it is looking at other alliances as well. A Sharp spokeswoman said no decisions have been made about accepting investments from other companies, while an Intel official declined to comment. Qualcomm officials were unable to immediately comment. The Osaka-based firm, which has lost three-quarters of its value so far in 2012, nearly doubled its forecast full-year net loss to 450 billion yen ($5.7 billion) earlier this month after booking a $1.1 billion restructuring charge in July-September. Effectively shunned by the debt capital markets because of its massive losses and falling market share, Sharp received a guarantee for 360 billion yen in loans from its two main lenders, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ and Mizuho Corporate Bank, in September. The loans are enough to sustain the company through its next financial year to March 2014, which includes the redemption of 200 billion yen in convertible bonds next September, Sharp Chief Financial Officer Tetsuo Onishi told a briefing.

Intel is promoting ultrabooks to counter tablet computers from Apple and earlier this year signed deals with several panel makers to ensure adequate supplies for a wave of ultrabooks with touch screens that use Microsoft Corp’s Windows 8. In late morning trade, Sharp shares stood at 162 yen, up 6.6 percent, while the benchmark Nikkei 225 was little changed. “Those who shorted the stock are covering their positions, so the rallies will likely be short-term,” said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management.

Given that semiconductor companies such as Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Texas Instruments (TXN.O) have been giving bleak forecasts in their quarterly reports, Rasgon said Qualcomm’s guidance looked impressive compared with his expectations for the semiconductor industry. “We’re going to be lucky if semiconductors are flat next year and they’re guiding up,” he said.

132,QCOM,UPDATE 2-Qualcomm to invest $120 mln in Japan's troubled Sharp,"TOKYO, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc will invest as much as $120 million in Sharp Corp, a cash injection likely to make it the struggling Japanese TV maker’s biggest shareholder, and to boost Sharp’s efforts to remain viable. As part of the agreement Qualcomm, through its Pixtronix subsidiary, will work with Sharp - which supplies screens to Apple Inc for its latest iPhone - to develop new power-saving screens based on Sharp’s IGZO technology, Sharp said. The two firms will also consider collaborating in the fabrication of chipsets. Sharp’s capital and business tie-up with the high-profile U.S. chipmaker may help reassure investors worried about the prospects of the debt-laden company that earlier this year averted failure with a $4.4 billion bank bailout . “With this agreement Sharp will accelerate its strategy for growth in small-to medium-sized LCDs,” the Japanese company said. The investment from Qualcomm will help Sharp bolster its shareholder equity ratio, which at the end of September stood at 9.9 percent, half the 20 percent level usually considered the minimum for financial stability. Qualcomm will make an initial investment of 4.93 billion yen ($59.91 million) by the end of the year in a private placement of stock at 164 yen per share, 10 yen less than Tuesday’s closing price. That will give the U.S. company a 2.64 percent stake after dilution. The timing and amount of the remaining investment has yet to be decided and will be conditional on Sharp returning to profit in the second half of the business year ending March 31. Sharp, which posted a 168 billion yen operating loss in the six months ending Sept. 30, forecast a loss of 155 billion yen for the full 12 months, meaning an implied profit of 13 billion for the second half. Achieving a profit would also allow its banks, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Mizuho Financial Group, to justify their bailout. Sharp had been expected to make Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd its biggest shareholder, adding to an earlier agreement to sell the Taiwanese company a stake in its advanced television LCD panel plant in Sakai, western Japan. That agreement, however, unravelled as losses mounted at the maker of Aquos TVs. Talks with Hon Hai to renegotiate its investment have since stalled, but it may buy some of Sharp’s overseas TV assembly plants. The Sankei newspaper reported on Sunday that Hon Hai plans to purchase three factories in China, Malaysia and Mexico for $667 million. Sharp’s shares rose 1.2 percent to 174 yen in Tokyo after the Nikkei business daily earlier reported the deal. That gain compares with a 0.3 percent dip in the benchmark Nikkei 225 index.

The world’s largest chipmaker dominates the PC industry but has been slow to adapt its processors for mobile gadgets that depend on batteries and demand power efficiency. At an industry conference in San Francisco on Monday, Intel reported on the progress of its technology for making SoCs, or “systems-on-a-chip” with features measuring 22 nanometers. “Intel’s 22 nm SoC technology will be ready for high volume manufacturing in 2013,” Intel said in a copy of the presentation. Intel’s current mobile SoCs are manufactured at 32 nm, while Qualcomm makes its top-end SoCs at 28 nm and Nvidia uses 40 nm technology. Manufacturing chips with smaller features allows for better performance and power efficiency. Intel already makes PC processors at 22 nm, but since SoCs pack more features onto one piece of silicon, manufacturing them at 22 nm is more complicated, said Patrick Moorhead, of Moor Insights & Analysis. “They (Intel) have all the right ingredients to make a very competitive mobile chip but we won’t know if they do until 2013,” Moorhead said.

142,QCOM,NY pension fund sues Qualcomm for political records,"(Reuters) - New York State’s $150-billion public pension fund has sued Qualcomm Inc., seeking to force the chipmaker to reveal its political spending, according to the state comptroller. The suit was filed late on Wednesday in Delaware Court of Chancery, after Qualcomm refused the request by the New York State Common Retirement Fund — a Qualcomm shareholder — to inspect records detailing the use of corporate resources for political activities, said state comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees the fund. “Without disclosure, there is no way to know whether corporate funds are being used in ways that go against shareholder interests,” DiNapoli, a Democrat who is up for re-election in 2014, said in a statement. The suit opens a new front in the fight over corporate political spending, which has risen dramatically since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling in Citizens United. That decision lifted restrictions on corporate political spending and led in part to an unprecedented $6 billion of spending on the recently held U.S. elections. While other companies have agreed to increase their disclosure of political spending, Qualcomm has not, the lawsuit said. A spokeswoman for San Diego, California-based Qualcomm said the company had no immediate comment. The New York State fund, the third-biggest public pension plan in the United States, owns more than 6.1 million Qualcomm shares, which are valued at about $396 million, based on Thursday’s share price. The stake represents 0.36 percent of outstanding Qualcomm shares and makes the fund the company’s 52nd largest shareholder, according to Thomson Reuters data. New York is Qualcomm’s largest U.S. public pension fund shareholder. The California Public Employees Retirement System, the largest U.S. pension fund with $241 billion in assets, owns about 4.3 million Qualcomm shares. Since at least August 2012, the pension fund has repeatedly attempted to get the information from Qualcomm, but the company has refused to divulge it, the suit claimed. New York’s pension fund is “concerned that it cannot determine whether senior executives and directors of Qualcomm are spending corporate resources to support their favored political candidates” or on causes that aren’t focused on boosting shareholder value, the complaint said. Other sources show that in 2012, Qualcomm spent more than $4.7 million on federal lobbying efforts, according to the complaint. The precise total is not known, DiNapoli told Reuters. “Qualcomm has been particularly resistant in terms of disclosure,” he said. “The real question is we don’t know what kind of spending they’re doing,” he said. “We have the right to have access to books to see where the spending is going.” In 2010, the fund and a group of other institutional investors asked most of the 500 biggest U.S. companies to disclose contributions. Over the past two years, the group filed 27 related shareholder resolutions seeking more transparency, reaching deals with 10 companies, the comptroller said. The suit is believed to be the first in Delaware, where Qualcomm and most major U.S. companies are incorporated, to use the state’s books-and-records law to compel political spending disclosures, a DiNapoli spokesman said. As an institutional investor, the fund could attempt to remove directors from Qualcomm’s board or sue board members if they were found to have wasted assets, the complaint said. DiNapoli’s office previously asked Qualcomm to provide documents that identified the date, recipient and amount of each political expenditure the company has made since January 21, 2010, as well as documents detailing the company’s expenses for trade associations and other tax-exempt groups. DiNapoli’s office also asked for minutes of board meetings during which political causes or candidates were discussed. The case would be tough to win if New York State claims that shareholders are entitled broadly to all documentation about political spending, according to Larry Hamermesh, a professor at Widener University School of Law in Wilmington, Delaware. “I can’t see a court saying that is correct any more than what a company spends on business in China are a legitimate subject for shareholder inspections,” he said. Hamermesh said investors might gain access if they take a targeted approach such as seeking contributions to specific races or contributions approved by the CEO. Charles Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said that if DiNapoli’s legal team cannot point to evidence — such as news reports that raised suspicions about the company’s spending — the lawsuit might not survive scrutiny by a judge who sees it as a fishing expedition, But if it passes muster, the suit could become a model for other shareholders, Elson said. DiNapoli’s complaint said that studies indicate that corporate political spending is, in general, negatively correlated with enterprise value and can indicate widespread deficiencies in corporate governance. Political donations can also backfire on corporations. For instance, Target Corp. in 2010 donated $150,000 to a political group that supported Minnesota gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer, who opposed same-sex marriage. The contribution sparked backlash and led Target to later apologize, the suit noted.

Jacobs opened the annual Consumer Electronics Show on Monday with a “Born Mobile” theme, saying that as many as a million new smartphones are being added to mobile networks every day, roughly double the number of babies born daily. CES, which attracts thousands of exhibitors and is expected to be attended by more than 150,000 people, is used by the industry each year to showcase upcoming products ranging from cellphones to giant televisions. In the keynote, which was historically reserved for Microsoft Corp, Jacobs streamed a clip for an upcoming movie using his company’s new chip Snapdragon 800. Qualcomm is the world’s biggest maker of chips for cellphones. He also showed how the chip, which will be available in the second half this year, would support mobile video games with a much greater level of detail than today’s most powerful phones. “This is console quality gaming on a mobile device,” Jacobs said. The Snapdragon 800 chip can also support recording and playback of ultra high-definition video, which has roughly four times the resolution of high-definition TV.

148,QCOM,Microsoft profit dips ahead of Office revamp,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said its quarterly profit fell as Office software sales slowed ahead of a new launch, offseting a solid start for its new Windows 8 operating system. Profit at the world’s largest software company slid to $6.4 billion, or 76 cents per share, in the fiscal second quarter, from $6.6 billion, or 78 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Wall Street had expected 75 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Overall sales rose 3 percent to $21.5 billion, Microsoft said on Thursday, in line with analysts’ estimates. With the loss of some deferred revenue to account for discounted upgrades to new software, Office revenue fell about 10 percent to $5.7 billion, which is not unusual ahead of a new launch, expected next week. Windows sales, which included some deferred revenue from the launch of Windows 8 last October, jumped 24 percent to $5.9 billion.

Microsoft shares fell slightly in after-hours trading. ",1242013,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-results/microsoft-profit-dips-ahead-of-office-revamp-idUSBRE90N17W20130124
149,QCOM,Microsoft profit dips ahead of Office revamp,"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp’s quarterly profit edged lower as Office software sales slowed ahead of a new launch, offsetting a solid but unspectacular start for its Windows 8 operating system and sending the company’s shares down 1.4 percent. The results mark a stark change from the 1990s, when Microsoft was the unchallenged king of computing and the release of a new Windows operating system would supercharge sales, generate excitement and generally boost its stock. None of that appears to be true now, as Microsoft has been overtaken by Apple Inc and Google Inc in the rush toward mobile computing, while sales of traditional desktop computers are in decline. “There’s still no sign that Windows 8 is a gangbuster,” said Andrew Bartels, an analyst at Forrester Research. “Compared to prior periods, where you saw a big increase when a new one came out, you’re not seeing that.” Profit at the world’s largest software company slid to $6.4 billion, or 76 cents per share, in the fiscal second quarter, from $6.6 billion, or 78 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Wall Street had expected 75 cents per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Overall sales rose 3 percent to $21.5 billion, Microsoft said on Thursday, in line with analysts’ estimates. The biggest factor weighing on Microsoft was a 10 percent decline in sales at its Office unit to $5.7 billion, which took into account the loss of deferred revenue relating to discounted upgrades to the new version of the software, expected shortly. “It’s a pause before a product launch, which is typical,” said Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones. Windows sales jumped 24 percent to $5.9 billion, slightly ahead of analysts’ average expectations, which had been gradually lowered over the last few months. That also included some deferred revenue relating to discounted upgrades. Microsoft said it has sold more than 60 million Windows 8 licenses since its late-October launch, an unexceptional start for a product which has not gripped the public’s imagination in the way of Apple’s iPad. The company already announced 60 million Windows 8 sales two weeks ago, broadly in line with Windows 7 sales three years before. “Windows 8 continues to have an uphill battle in convincing investors this is going to be the key to the growth story for Microsoft,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. “It continues to be a major prove-me product cycle.” Microsoft did not detail sales of its new Surface tablet - a direct competitor to the iPad - although chief financial officer Peter Klein said the company was expanding production and distribution. Windows executives suggest that Windows will win more people over when new touch-screen devices start hitting the shelves in coming months. “Demand is stronger than supply across a number of key device types, whether Windows tablets, convertibles, or all-in-ones,” Tami Reller, chief financial officer of Microsoft’s Windows unit, told Reuters earlier this month. “Most of the opportunity is still ahead of us.” Analysts seem prepared to give Microsoft more time to prove its point. “It’s been disruptive but the PC market is far from dead,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. “Even if they have minimal success with Surface, they don’t need much to move the needle.” Microsoft shares have fallen 2 percent since Windows 8 was launched on October 26, compared to a 5 percent gain in the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index. They fell to $27.06 in after-hours trading, after closing at $27.23 on Nasdaq.

Qualcomm shares rose 6 percent in late trade on Wednesday as the outlook from the leading supplier of chips for cellphones wowed investors in contrast with sluggish demand at chip makers such as Texas Instruments and Broadcom Corp. The company, which also announced the retirement of its chief financial officer on Wednesday, said it was seeing strong growth in emerging markets such as China and Latin America. But outgoing CFO Bill Keitel said on the company’s conference call with analysts that the outlook also reflects macro economic weakness. “Given continued global macroeconomic uncertainties, we are continuing to maintain a cautious outlook for the year ahead,” said Keitel, who will be replaced by George Davis, currently CFO of Applied Materials, in March. San Diego-based Qualcomm is benefiting from strong demand for smartphones and a move by network operators around the world to a high-speed wireless technology known as Long Term Evolution (LTE), where Qualcomm is ahead of rivals. “That trend is continuing to work in Qualcomm’s favor. They’re the only viable option for LTE right now,” said MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum. “It’s a very strong quarter and the guidance is very strong.” As well as supplying chips for cellphones and tablet computers, Qualcomm also receives royalty payments from any cellphone makers that do not use its chips. “It looks like in the quarter, a little bit of the upside came from chipsets,” said Berenbaum. “In the guidance, chipsets came in around expectations. It looks like royalties are the upside to guidance.” Qualcomm raised its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $23.4 billion to $24.4 billion from its previous target of $23 billion to $24 billion.

152,QCOM,"Qualcomm beats street, raises guidance, shares rise","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue and raised its financial targets for 2013 due to growing demand for smartphones and high-speed wireless services. Qualcomm shares rose 6 percent in late trade on Wednesday as the outlook from the leading supplier of chips for cellphones wowed investors in contrast with sluggish demand at chip makers such as Texas Instruments (TXN.O) and Broadcom Corp BRCM.O. The company, which also announced the retirement of its chief financial officer on Wednesday, said it was seeing strong growth in emerging markets such as China and Latin America. But outgoing CFO Bill Keitel said on the company’s conference call with analysts that the outlook also reflects macro economic weakness. “Given continued global macroeconomic uncertainties, we are continuing to maintain a cautious outlook for the year ahead,” said Keitel, who will be replaced by George Davis, currently CFO of Applied Materials (AMAT.O), in March. San Diego-based Qualcomm is benefiting from strong demand for smartphones and a move by network operators around the world to a high-speed wireless technology known as Long Term Evolution (LTE), where Qualcomm is ahead of rivals. “That trend is continuing to work in Qualcomm’s favor. They’re the only viable option for LTE right now,” said MKM Partners analyst Daniel Berenbaum. “It’s a very strong quarter and the guidance is very strong.” As well as supplying chips for cellphones and tablet computers, Qualcomm also receives royalty payments from any cellphone makers that do not use its chips. “It looks like in the quarter, a little bit of the upside came from chipsets,” said Berenbaum. “In the guidance, chipsets came in around expectations. It looks like royalties are the upside to guidance.” Qualcomm raised its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $23.4 billion to $24.4 billion from its previous target of $23 billion to $24 billion.

157,QCOM,UPDATE 1-Broadcom unveils its first LTE chip to rival Qualcomm,"NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Broadcom Corp said customers are now testing its first chip based on the latest high-speed wireless technology, creating new competition for bigger rival Qualcomm Inc, which was years ahead of the rest of the market. Broadcom said on Tuesday it expects its chips for Long Term Evolution (LTE) high-speed devices to go into production in 2014. Many of the world’s biggest service providers are building or already offering services based on LTE. Broadcom, the maker of chips used in devices from companies such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  said in December that it would start sampling its LTE chips in 2013, but it did not say when exactly, disappointing some investors at the time. Rivals, including Intel Corp, Marvell Technology Group Ltd and Nvidia Corp, are expected to follow shortly with their own LTE products, further heating up the market. But Broadcom may have better chance than most of Qualcomm’s rivals if its customers like the product, Brean Capital analyst Mike Burton said. “Broadcom has the scale that’s going to be required to be a successful supplier going forward,” Burton said. He added that phone makers will be anxious to add at least one more supplier of LTE chips to improve their negotiating power and so they do not have to depend on one supplier in case of shortages. “The (device makers) want choices. They want somebody to keep Qualcomm honest,” he said. Broadcom shares were up 34 cents, or 1 percent at $33.73, in afternoon trading on Nasdaq, where Qualcomm shares were down $1.10 or almost 2 percent at $66.08. J.P.

160,QCOM,RF chipmakers shares rebound as Qualcomm entry concerns ease,"(Reuters) - Shares in specialist radio frequency chipmakers Skyworks Solutions Inc and RF Micro Devices Inc regained lost ground on Friday as analysts debated the significance of looming competition from cellphone chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. Skyworks shares rose 5 percent and RFMD shares 4 percent, recouping some of the losses suffered on Thursday after Qualcomm unveiled plans for its own radio frequency (RF) chip. Qualcomm’s low-power radio chipset, dubbed RF360, promises to work across various bands, raising concerns that the entry of a mobile chip heavyweight would limit growth of the radio chipmakers. Lazard Capital Markets analysts said on Friday they would be surprised if Qualcomm would risk damaging integrated circuit partnerships to seek a maximum operating income opportunity of about $400 million to $600 million. “We believe QCOM’s front-end RF360 solution is largely a ‘proof of concept’ to pressure the industry to solve ‘band fragmentation’ vs a dominant solution that could threaten RFMD,” Lazard analysts wrote in a note. The brokerage upgraded RF Micro’s stock to “buy” from “neutral.” However, analysts at Raymond James downgraded their ratings on both RF Micro and Skyworks stocks by a notch on Thursday. “Qualcomm’s entry into new markets tends to be a bit underwhelming in the first 1-2 years, but almost universally successful in the longer term, sometimes through acquisition,” Raymond James analysts said. San Diego-based Qualcomm is benefiting from strong demand for smartphones and a move by network operators around the world to a high-speed wireless technology known as long-term evolution (LTE), where the company is ahead of its rivals. Countries deploy LTE with various bands of radio spectrum leading to band fragmentation. There are about 40 cellular radio bands worldwide and that poses a challenge for manufacturers looking at which bands to support in their devices. RF Micro shares were up 3 percent at $4.75, while Skyworks shares 2 percent at $21.76 on the Nasdaq. Qualcomm shares were trading flat. Shares in IQE Plc fell as much as 19 percent on Friday on the London Stock Exchange as Qualcomm’s radio frequency front-end chip could pose a threat to its compound semiconductors.

163,QCOM,Intel debuts new smartphone chip as mobile market consolidates,"SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 24 (Reuters) - PC chipmaker Intel Inc  hopes its new smartphone processor will help it find a foothold in a mobile market coalescing around Apple AAPL.O>, Samsung Electronics and Qualcomm. Intel says its latest processor for mainstream smartphones, dubbed Clover Trail+, delivers up to double the computing performance and three times the graphics horsepower of its first smartphone chip, which was used last year in devices sold in Europe, Africa, China and India. Intel dominates the PC industry but shipments have been falling due to the growing popularity of smarpthones and tablets - markets the chipmaker underestimated. The company has been rushing to catch up with Qualcomm, Apple and Samsung, which design chips with technology licensed from ARM Holdings. The Santa Clara, California chipmaker has made progress improving the power-efficiency and computing power of its mobile processors. The Clover Trail+ chips, built with two cores and launched ahead of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Monday, have been chosen by Lenovo to power an upcoming smartphone for China, Intel said in a press release. Intel’s single-core Medfield smartphone processor was launched last year and have been used in 10 handsets across 20 countries, although the company’s global market share in smartphone chips remains below 1 percent, according to Strategy Analytics. After delays, Intel expects in the next few months to start shipping phone chips with Long Term Evolution, or LTE, a high-speed wireless technology already offered by Qualcomm and increasingly found in smartphones launched in the United States, including Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy S3. Intel-powered phones with LTE, which allows for faster downloads of movies, songs and other content, could appear in stores next year. CEO Paul Otellini has often described Intel’s strategy for expanding into mobile as “a marathon, not a sprint”, but the cut-throat market for smartphone chips increasingly appears to be a three-man race between Apple, Samsung and Qualcomm. Samsung and Apple together accounted for 51 percent of the smartphone market in the December quarter, compared to 46 percent in the same period the year before, according to IDC. Samsung manufactures processors for the iPhone and iPad on behalf of Apple and also increasingly makes its own smartphone chips. Top mobile chipmaker Qualcomm’s stock market value overtook Intel’s for the first time in November. “The issue is the customer environment. Apple and Samsung make their own and the rest of the world has gone Qualcomm,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “They (Intel) need LTE and they need to show that their products aren’t just a little better. They have to be massively better.” In January, Intel announced a new processor platform, codenamed Lexington, targeted at low-priced smartphones in emerging markets like Latin America and Asia where Apple, Qualcomm and Samsung are less dominant and LTE is not a must-have. With Wall Street increasingly worried about slowing PC sales and Intel’s lack of market share in mobile, the chipmaker’s stock has lost a quarter of its value over the past 12 months.",2252013,http://www.reuters.com/article/intel-mobile/intel-debuts-new-smartphone-chip-as-mobile-market-consolidates-idUSL1N0BK8OL20130225

166,QCOM,Game on for chip makers as mobile devices seek competitive edge,"* Graphics chips the latest battleground * Qualcomm, NVIDIA, STMicro among big players * Online gaming key for phones and tablets By Harro Ten Wolde BARCELONA, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Chip makers are battling fiercely to satisfy the appetite of lookalike smartphones and tablets trying to differentiate themselves by claiming supremacy in gaming graphics, previously the preserve of PCs and consoles. To try to steal a march on its rivals, Qualcomm has added a team of 35 developers to create games that test new processing chips to their maximum capacity and show app developers the brave new world they can conquer. “It is not to bring (the games) to the market, but to show what the opportunities are,” Raj Talluri, Qualcomm’s head of product management, said at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. “With our new processors you will see more high resolution, high complexity, true 3D games on mobile.” The challenge for the likes of Qualcomm, Intel and NVIDIA is to make chips that are faster and can process clearer graphics, but which also use less power and cost less, making them suitable for as many phones and tablets as possible. “The best is yet to come, Talluri said. “Right now the games are good, but I think we still haven’t taken advantage of everything we have.” The improved technology will enable phones and tablets to offer online games more sophisticated than hits such as Rovio’s Angry Birds and Zynga’s FarmVille, which have drawn many new users to gaming. New chips should allow gamers to play against each other live and put graphics more usually associated with the likes of the Call of Duty series on mobile and tablet screens as well as consoles such as Microsoft’s Xbox. Global revenues from online games will reach $35 billion in 2017, from $19 billion in 2012, and account for 40 percent of the market, according to research firm DFC Intelligence. Following that money is the smartphone applications processor market, which hit $3.8 billion in the third quarter of 2012, up 58 percent from a year earlier, says Strategy Analytics. The main battleground, however, is the graphics processing unit (GPU), which generates the ever-more realistic pictures on screen. “Graphics capability is really important,” said Ben Wood, analyst at CCS Insight. “All the phones just look the same now ... You need to differentiate on the experience.” Wood’s research shows that gaming is one of the primary activities for tablet users. LOW-END RICHES Adding to the attraction of smartphones and tablets are “mirroring programmes” such as Miracast and Apple’s  AirPlay Mirroring, which connect to television screens and dispense with the need for a separate gaming console. The other battleground is latency, or the response time between the movement of the device and the action on the screen. To cut the delay, the chip needs more power, which can lead it to overheat the device. “(Our new chip) gives the power you need without burning in your hands,” said Jean-Marc Chery, of chip maker STMicroelectronics. Qualcomm is also making lower-end versions of its graphic chips for cheaper phones, broadening the potential audience and luring young users who are often heavy gamers but cannot afford high-end smartphones. “The low end is where the biggest audience for gaming is, said Qualcomm’s Talluri. “That’s why mobile and 3D gaming has only just started taking off.”",2282013,http://www.reuters.com/article/mobile-world-chips/game-on-for-chip-makers-as-mobile-devices-seek-competitive-edge-idUSL6N0BR94S20130228

171,QCOM,UPDATE 1-Sharp to miss March 29 deadline for Qualcomm investment,"TOKYO, March 18 (Reuters) - Sharp Corp said it will miss a March 29 deadline to receive the second half of a $120 million investment from  Qualcomm Inc after it failed to complete a plan to begin fabricating power-saving screens the two companies are jointly developing. Qualcomm, which paid half the $120 million in December, set conditions for the remainder that included having completed the specifications for the smartphone and tablet PC screens and preparations for their production. San Diego-based chip maker Qualcomm also said Sharp would have to make an operating profit in the second half of its business year and have at least 100 billion yen ($1.05 billion) of net assets. “The financial targets are not the reason for the delay,” Sharp spokeswoman Miyuki Nakayama said. Sharp and Qualcomm will now fall back to a June 30 deadline for the Japanese company to meet conditions for the second payment, she added. The two companies said in December that Qualcomm, through its Pixtronix subsidiary, would work with Sharp to develop new power-saving screens based on Sharp’s IGZO technology. Missing the second deadline would add pressure on cash-strapped Sharp as it looks for money to repay a $2.1 billion convertible bond in September. Japan’s leading LCD panel maker has also failed to renegotiate an agreement for Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co to buy a 9.9 percent stake, with a March 26 deadline expected to pass with no revised agreement in place. Samsung Electronics Co this month agreed to invest $110 million in Sharp, which supplies screens for Apple Inc’s iPhone5 and iPad, in return for a 3 percent stake and a promise from Sharp to bolster panel supplies to the Korean company. To meet its financial obligations sources at Sharp and its banks, as well as analysts, have told Reuters they expect the Osaka-based company will resort to equity financing to make up any shortfall after it adds up available cashflow and gains from asset and stake sales. Sharp is in talks to sell its Chinese TV assembly plant to Lenovo Group Ltd and its Mexican TV factory to Hon Hai. Sharp, however, is limited in its ability to sell assets because last year it had to mortgage most of its domestic plants and offices to secure a $3.8 billion bank bailout, A junk rating from credit agencies has also made raising money in the credit markets expensive.",3182013,http://www.reuters.com/article/sharp-qualcomm/update-1-sharp-to-miss-march-29-deadline-for-qualcomm-investment-idUSL3N0CA05R20130318

176,QCOM,Google to sell second-gen Nexus 7 tablet from July: sources,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Google Inc will launch a new version of its Nexus 7 tablet powered by Qualcomm Inc’s Snapdragon processor around July, two sources told Reuters, as the software giant pushes deeper into the cut-price mobile hardware market. Google is aiming to ship as many as eight million of the Asustek-made tablets in the second half of the year, throwing down the gauntlet to other low-end tablets such as Amazon.com Inc’s Kindle Fire and Apple Inc’s iPad mini, the sources with knowledge of the new product said. This is the first time details about the timing and sales targets for Google’s new tablet have been unveiled, although the company has not publicly released any information. Google, which gets almost all of its revenue from online advertising, wants the aggressively priced Nexus tablets to be a hit as more Nexus users would mean more exposure for Google’s ads. The latest version will have a higher screen resolution, a thinner bezel design and adopt Qualcomm’s chip in place of Nvidia Corp’s Tegra 3, which was used in the first Nexus 7s released last year, the sources said, declining to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media. In a blow to Nvidia, Google weighed both U.S. chipmakers’ processors but finally decided on Qualcomm’s for power reasons, one of the sources added. Qualcomm and Nvidia are competing aggressively in the tablet market as they seek to expand from their traditional strongholds of cellphones and PCs respectively. A Google spokesman declined to comment on its new tablet. Qualcomm and Nvidia also declined to respond to questions. Google and other traditionally non-hardware companies like Amazon and Microsoft Corp have begun making inroads into mobile devices as consumers increasingly access the Web on the go. Google introduced its first tablet last June, hoping to replicate its smartphone success in a hotly contested market now dominated by Kindle Fire and iPad. The Nexus 7 joined the ranks of smaller, 7-inch tablets popularized by Amazon and Samsung Electronics, among others. Pricing is yet to be determined and Google’s plans are fluid, the sources said. Market leader Apple is expected to launch new iPads this year as well, possibly forcing its competitors to change their assumptions. Google may choose to sell the new gadget for $199, the same as the first generation rolled out last June, while the old model may be discounted, one of the sources said. Alternatively, the new tablet could be priced more competitively at $149 and the previous model discontinued, the source added. The cheapest iPad mini goes for more than $300. Though pricing has not been finalized, discounting could play to Google’s and Amazon’s strengths by getting cheaper hardware into more consumers’ hands to drive revenue from their core Internet-based businesses. “This is the ‘zero margin strategy’,” said Fubon Securities analyst Arthur Liao. “Ninety-seven percent of Google’s revenue comes from advertisement, so it needs to sell more mobile devices in order to reach more consumers.” The Internet search giant, which has never disclosed tablet sales, plans to ship six to eight million of the new Nexus 7s in the second half of this year, the sources said. That compares to an estimated 4.6 million Nexus 7s sold in the same period last year, according to Enders Analysis mobile industry analyst Benedict Evans. The large volume could help to accelerate development of tablet-specific applications for its Android operating software. Asustek, a netbook PC pioneer, will continue to co-brand with Google on the new Nexus 7.

178,QCOM,Qualcomm's earnings outlook points to competition in Asia,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm forecast earnings below expectations on Wednesday as competition in smartphones intensifies and shifts toward Asia, and its stock fell sharply. San Diego-based Qualcomm is benefiting from strong demand for smartphones and a shift by network operators worldwide to a high-speed wireless technology known as long-term evolution (LTE), where the chipmaker is ahead of rivals. But the market potential is attracting growing competition from smaller rivals eager to expand their mobile presence in Asia and other developing regions. Qualcomm said it expects full-year revenue of $24.0 billion to $25 billion, up from its prior forecast of between $23.4 billion and $24.4 billion. But investors focused on its full-year earnings per share forecast, which fell short of some expectations. “You’re seeing revenue upside but not the earnings upside you’d want to come with it,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “Whether it’s because of competition or they’re investing to stop competition, either way - it can lead to margin decline.” With investors concerned that Apple’s growth may be slowing, shares of Qualcomm, which makes chips for the iPhone, have risen about 7 percent this year, less than the 13 percent increase in the Philadelphia Semiconductor index. Smartphone shipments are increasing, but less quickly than last year. The global smartphone market is likely to expand 27 percent this year, less than the 46 percent growth last year, according to IDC. Qualcomm’s chips are not only found in high-end devices like the iPhone and Samsung Electronics’ soon-to-launch Galaxy S4. They are also are used in lower-priced handsets popular in Asia and other developing areas that are expected to drive future smartphone growth as the United States reaches saturation. Low-cost handsets weigh on Qualcomm’s profitability. Manufacturers of lower-cost phones pay lower royalties for Qualcomm’s network technology and also buy cheaper components from the chipmaker, instead of its top-tier offerings. The growing importance of developing countries also means Qualcomm will face more challenges from Mediatek, Spreadtrum Communications and other chipmakers that are improving their technology and are happy to sacrifice profits in exchange for market share in Asia. “When you’re trying to stay on top, and you’ve got players trying to knock you off, you have to spend to stay there,” Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree said of Qualcomm. Qualcomm said it expects full-year earnings per share between $4.40 and $4.55. Analysts expected $4.54, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It reported fiscal second-quarter revenue of $6.12 billion, an increase of 24 percent from a year ago. It said revenue in the current quarter would be between $5.8 billion and $6.3 billion. Analysts on average expected second-quarter revenue of $6.085 billion and third-quarter revenue of $5.883 billion. Qualcomm said second-quarter net income was $1.87 billion, down 16 percent year over year. It said earnings per share were $1.06. Its non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.17, in line with expectations. Shares of Qualcomm fell 6 percent to $61.80 in extended trade after closing up 1 percent at $66.00.

183,QCOM,"Qualcomm steps up chip branding campaign, plans TV ad","SANTA CLARA, California (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc is stepping up its Snapdragon chip branding campaign, including a commercial for movie theaters and television, in a bid to build customer loyalty in an increasingly competitive smartphone industry. Chief Marketing Officer Anand Chandrasekher showed analysts a commercial playing in US theaters and said it would also be rolled out in other countries, including China. Qualcomm plans to air it on national TV within the next couple of months. “We’re trying to build an emotional bond with our customers,” Chandrasekher said. San Diego-based Qualcomm is benefiting from strong demand for mobile devices and a shift by network operators worldwide to a high-speed wireless technology known as long-term evolution (LTE), where the chipmaker is ahead of rivals. Its Snapdragon processors are widely used as the brain in tablets and smartphones. But last week Qualcomm forecast earnings below expectations as competition in smartphones intensifies and shifts toward Asia. Since the 1990s, Qualcomm has been a major player in the mobile chip industry but like most electronics component makers, branding has been a low priority during most of that time. As a rule, it’s seen as a good idea to add extra branding to products like smartphones only when the additional brand strongly conveys a quality that the handset maker’s own brand lacks, industry experts say. Intel’s “Intel Inside” ad campaign has been a notable exception and the top chipmaker has extended it from personal computers to the handful of smartphones in Europe, Asia and Africa made with its processors. “It’s not our intention to compete with our customers’ or partners’ brands. ... Our brand should be accretive to big brands, not dilutive,” Chandrasekher said. Last year, Qualcomm began to step up its branding efforts, targeting its ads at technology enthusiasts through social media and other online efforts.

185,QCOM,Intel revamps Atom chips in bid to find mobile footing,"SANTA CLARA, California, May 6 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  on Monday unveiled the most extensive overhaul of its Atom mobile processors, with improved performance that the PC chipmaker expects will help it challenge Qualcomm in smartphones and tablets. The new microarchitecture, code-named Silvermont, will be a key building block in upcoming Intel chips for mobile gadgets, microservers and car entertainment systems, Chief Product Officer Dadi Perlmutter told reporters at an event on Monday. “We have not only reduced the power in a significant manner but it comes with significant performance,” Perlmutter said. Intel’s chips dominate the PC industry but the company has struggled to adapt its processors for smartphones and tablets, a market dominated by Qualcomm. The Silvermont microarchitecture is analogous to redesigning an automobile engine that will be used a range of car models with different features, Perlmutter said. He said it offers up to three times more computing performance than current chips and as much as five times lower power consumption. Qualcomm and other mobile chipmakers design their processors using power-efficient technology licensed from Intel-rival ARM Holdings. Intel introduced its Atom mobile processors for netbooks in 2008 and they have so far failed to be widely adopted in smartphones and tablets despite improvements made to them. Silvermont will be the basis for Intel’s 22-nanometer Bay Trail tablet chips due out later this year and Intel says it will more than double the performance of its current tablet chips. It will also be used in Intel’s upcoming Merrifield smartphone chips and Avoton chips for microservers. While Silvermont improves the performance of Intel’s processors, the Santa Clara, California company faces other major challenges in mobile. It has fallen behind in launching chips with Long Term Evolution, or LTE, a high-speed wireless technology already offered by Qualcomm and increasingly found in smartphones launched in the United States, including Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy line.",5062013,http://www.reuters.com/article/intel-atom/intel-revamps-atom-chips-in-bid-to-find-mobile-footing-idUSL2N0DN0YY20130506

188,QCOM,CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Qualcomm quarterly revenue beats Street; stock up,"(Corrects analyst’s last name in fourth paragraph) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, July 24 (Reuters) - Shares of Qualcomm Inc  rose more than 3 percent after the leading mobile chipmaker posted third-quarter results that met expectations and eased concerns about slower growth of smartphone sales. Few semiconductor companies have benefited more from the mobile revolution than Qualcomm, but the supplier of chips for Apple Inc’s iPhones and Android devices has begun to face pressure as growth in smartphone sales shifts to Asia. In its fiscal third-quarter report on Wednesday, Qualcomm met expectations for earnings and was ahead on revenue. “It looks like momentum is continuing. It doesn’t feel like the smartphone story is over,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. In Apple’s quarterly report on Tuesday, the Cupertino, California company said it sold more iPhones than Wall Street had expected. Network operators worldwide are shifting to a high-speed wireless technology known as long-term evolution (LTE) that Qualcomm is a leader in, helping the company grow much faster than Intel Corp and other suppliers of chips for personal computers. But Qualcomm faces competition from small Asian mobile chipmakers as well as market leader Intel, whose mobile push is showing promising signs after failing to attract device makers in recent years. “We watch those who we consider our competitors very closely,” said Qualcomm Senior Vice President Bill Davidson. “Intel hasn’t seen great success in terms of market traction yet but we clearly watch them just based on their capabilities.” Qualcomm posted fiscal third-quarter revenue of $6.24 billion and net income of $1.58 billion, or 90 cents a share, boosted by growing demand for smartphones in Asia. It said revenue in the current quarter, which ends in September, would range from $5.9 billion to $6.6 billion. Analysts on average had expected third-quarter revenue of $6.055 billion and fourth-quarter revenue of $6.293 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “This is better than the Street had been girding for, given what’s been going in the smartphone markets,” said Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree. For the fiscal third quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.03, in line with expectations. Qualcomm estimated fiscal 2013 non-GAAP earnings of $4.48 to $4.56 per share. Its previous forecast was $4.40 to $4.55. Shares of Qualcomm rose 3.53 percent in extended trade after closing down 1.46 percent at $61.39 on Nasdaq.

190,QCOM,Renesas plans to close major chip plant in Japan - sources,"TOKYO, July 27 (Reuters) - Japan’s Renesas Electronics Corp  plans to close a system LSI chip plant in northern Japan that makes chips for Nintendo Co Ltd’s Wii game consoles and other consumer electronics, after failing to find a buyer for the facility, sources familiar with the matter said on Saturday. The state-of-the-art Tsuruoka plant’s 1,000 employees will be offered reassignments or voluntary redundancy, the sources said, as Renesas restructures to focus on making microcontrollers for automotive electronics, where it holds the top global market share. The sources had no estimate for the cost of the shutdown, expected to take place over the next two to three years. A Renesas spokesman declined to comment. Several of Japan’s chip makers, like the game console and consumer electronics makers they supply, have struggled as consumers start using their smartphones and tablets to play games and take photographs, instead of dedicated devices. Some, however, have benefited from the smartphone boom, including NAND memory chip maker Toshiba Corp and image sensor chip maker Sony Corp, although Sony’s consumer electronics operations are struggling. Renesas had been in talks to sell the Tsuruoka plant to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, although the sources said the two companies could not reach an agreement. The sources gave no reason for the failed talks, although Japan’s system LSI manufacturers have struggled to compete with Taiwan’s chip foundries, which produce chips for design firms such as Qualcomm Inc and have invested aggressively in new technologies. Renesas is due to receive a 150 billion yen ($1.53 billion) investment by end-September led by the state-run Innovation Network Corporation of Japan.

193,QCOM,"Alcatel posts strong second-quarter, signs Qualcomm partnership","PARIS (Reuters) - Struggling telecom equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent surfed on strong growth in its key U.S. market to beat analysts’ estimates and said mobile chip maker Qualcomm would buy a minority stake as part of a research partnership. In the first full quarter under a new Chief Executive Michel Combes, the smaller competitor to Sweden’s Ericsson and China’s Huawei posted a quarterly sales rise of 1.9 percent to 3.61 billion euros ($4.78 billion). Demand for so-called IP products, which help direct data traffic inside telecom networks, grew sharply and pushed up profits, supporting Combes’ decision to put them at the center of his strategy to deliver a rebound that has eluded his successors. But recovery at Alcatel-Lucent, which has lost more than $10 billion since it was created through a 2006 merger, will depend in part on whether telecom operators increase overall spending in the coming years to build superfast mobile broadband or if they trim budgets elsewhere to compensate. Alcatel-Lucent will have to duke it out with its bigger competitors, including Nokia-Siemens Networks and Ericsson, for contract wins. Adjusted operating profit was 46 million euros or 1.3 percent of revenues. Analysts had predicted losses. Shares in Alcatel-Lucent were up 8.8 percent at 0748 GMT(3.48 a.m. ET) Combes said he would seek three to five partnerships like the Qualcomm deal in a bid to increase Alcatel’s R&D; firepower. The U.S. chip maker will take a less than 5 percent stake, he said, and the pact is worth some 100 million euros in research funding. “Other discussions are underway... we hope to make announcements on in the coming quarters,” said Combes. Despite investors’ euphoria, the group’s second-quarter results were marked by a net loss of 871 million euros caused by a writedown of its sub-scale wireless business. And Alcatel-Lucent consumed more cash - 248 million euros - in its operations than it generated, a perennial problem for the group. Alexandre Peterc, analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said the quarterly results could lead to upgrades to consensus but cautioned that investors should avoid the risky stock. “Alcatel shares remain extremely risky and volatile,” said Peterc in a note. “Though Q2 is good, beating consensus, cash is still worsening faster than anticipated.” In June, Combes pledged to focus the group on high-growth products in IP networking and high-mobile and fixed broadband, while maximizing profits out of older products. One billion euros of unspecified asset sales and a billion of cost cuts are also slated through 2015.

195,QCOM,Facebook-led project seeks Internet access for all,"(Reuters) - Facebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg has enlisted Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Qualcomm Inc and other technology companies to help him in a project aimed at making Internet access affordable for the 5 billion people around the world who are not online. The group, called internet.org, is the latest effort by an Internet company to seek to expand Web access to emerging economies. It follows a similar thrust by Facebook rival Google Inc, which uses everything from balloons to fiber connections to expand connectivity. While short on specifics, Zuckerberg’s group intends to explore everything from lower-cost smartphones and providing Internet access to underserved communities, to working out ways to reduce the amount of data downloads required to run mobile Internet applications such as Facebook. Zuckerberg did not give an estimate on how much it would cost to connect the world’s population to the Internet. He said the key is to cut network operators’ costs for providing data services so they can in turn lower the prices charged to consumers. The 29-year-old who founded Facebook in his university dorm room said in a 10-page document released on Wednesday that he hopes the efficiency of data delivery will improve 100-fold in the next five to ten years. Keith Mallinson, a longtime telecom industry analyst, said that while the concepts and technologies Zuckerberg cites could be viable, the commercial interests of big companies and government politics could create bigger obstacles. “There has to be a lot of heavy lifting to make all these things happen and to coordinate them,” said Mallinson, who founded research firm WiseHarbour. While 2.7 billion people are already online, the number is increasing by less than 9 percent annually, a rate that Zuckerberg said was too slow. Two-thirds of the world’s population still has no Internet access. While many of today’s Facebook members use the service just to keep in touch with friends, Zuckerberg said future Internet users may have more lofty needs. “They’re going to use it to decide what kind of governments they want, get access to healthcare for the first time ever, connect with family hundreds of miles away that they haven’t seen in decades,” he told CNN’s “New Day” show on Wednesday. The world’s largest social network with 1 billion-plus members, Facebook once harbored ambitions of becoming an all-encompassing Web destination with everything from searches to messaging and shopping, analysts say. But a succession of forays into new areas, such as its “Home” interface for smartphones, fizzled. Zuckerberg said in the CNN interview that internet.org was for now a “rough plan.” He said the project was not just about making money for Facebook, which needs to keep expanding to boost revenue. He noted that the first billion Facebook members “have way more money” than the rest of the world combined. Facebook recently surprised Wall Street by reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly results, helped by an increase in advertising revenue from mobile users. The earnings report was a much-needed boost for the company, which has struggled to regain credibility after a rocky initial public offering in May 2012. It remains under pressure to sustain its high growth rate by expanding into new markets. Besides Facebook, other players in internet.org include Ericsson, MediaTek Inc, Nokia and Opera Software ASA. While the list did not include mobile network operators, Zuckerberg said these companies would play a central role. For example, he suggested improvements such as new antenna technology and data-caching, new types of partnerships and better use of wireless airwaves, which are typically auctioned to carriers for billions of dollars in government sales. He also suggested that linking consumers’ Facebook accounts with carriers could provide operators more consumer data. Analyst Mallinson said it may be difficult to get governments to change their policies on spectrum but suggested that Internet and telecom companies could change how they do business. For example, Internet firms like Facebook and Google, which do not have to build or maintain vast public networks that carry Internet traffic, could pass some advertising revenue on to carriers that spend billions of dollars on networks to help reduce data prices for consumers, he said. Google has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on fledgling network projects such as local high-speed fiber networks. But it now depends almost completely on traditional telecom companies to deliver its services to consumers. In June, Google announced a small network of balloons over the Southern Hemisphere in an experiment it hopes to use to bring reliable Internet access to remote regions. The pilot program, Project Loon, took off from New Zealand’s South Island, using solar-powered, high-altitude balloons that ride the wind about 12.5 miles, or twice as high as airplanes, above the ground.

200,QCOM,Samsung and Qualcomm make foray into smartwatch market,"BERLIN/SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Qualcomm Inc unveiled smartwatches on Wednesday, tapping a potential “wearables” market worth an estimated $50 billion as the high-end mobile phone market becomes saturated. The companies launched the devices at nearly simultaneous events in Berlin and San Diego, and some analysts immediately questioned whether the devices were too costly, with expected prices near $300. Samsung’s Galaxy Gear smartwatch works as an accessory to its market-leading Galaxy smartphone, with a small screen offering basic functions such as photos, hands-free calls and instant messaging. Qualcomm’s “Toq” smartwatch can play music and handle phone calls and messages. It will be the first smartwatch with a touch-enabled “Mirasol” color screen that can be viewed easily in bright sunlight. The launch by Qualcomm, which dominates the global market for applications processors for smartphones and tablets, is seen not so much as a hot seller but as a “reference” design or device to show off the Mirasol screens, in hopes the display technology will be more widely adopted as wearables of all types take off. Samsung, which is the world’s top handset maker, hopes the Galaxy Gear will boost the appeal of its range of Android-powered smartphones, as it battles to maintain supremacy against arch rival Apple Inc. Its launch, timed to coincide with the start of the IFA consumer electronics trade show in Berlin, also signals that the South Korean giant is more than just a fast follower in innovation behind Apple, which is preparing to release a new iPhone next week but has yet to go public with any wearable devices. “I believe it will become a new fashion icon in the world,” J.K. Shin, Samsung’s co-chief executive and head of mobile business, said at its “Unpacked 2013 Episode 2” event. The market potential for wearable devices is significant. Leveraging advances in voice technology, biometrics, communications, cloud storage and power consumption, smartwatches and other wearable devices could be a $50 billion market by 2017, according to Credit Suisse. Apple Inc and Google Inc are also widely believed to be working on “wearables” such as wrist-worn devices, in what analysts expect to be the next phase of the mobile communications boom. The exploration of such wearable-computing devices has accelerated in recent years as smartphone growth tapers off. Samsung’s smartwatch features a 1.63-inch (4.14-cm) screen as well as a basic camera, and will connect to Samsung’s latest Galaxy Note 3 smartphone via wireless Bluetooth technology. It will make calls, display messages, record videos and snap photos, all while the user’s phone stays in their pocket or handbag. Clunky, earlier versions of Samsung’s smartwatch in 1999 and 2009 didn’t go down well with consumers. But the success of the company’s latest release will be measured as much in how it affects sales of high-end Galaxy smartphones as in sales of the device itself. “We had smartwatch-type products before, but they were mainly for making phone calls. What’s different with the Gear is it’s got far more useful functions. It’s usability has increased significantly and design is not bulky,” Shin said. The Gear will go on sale later this month for $299 while Qualcomm’s Toq will begin selling in the fourth quarter. Qualcomm did not specify a price. Tech blog Cnet reported it will sell for $300. “The real question is, will this app enhancement make the purchase of yet another smart device worth it?” said Brian Proffitt, author of several books on mobile technology and an adjunct instructor of management in the University of Notre Dame. “It’s great to have hands-free capabilities to take notes or snap a picture, but is it $299 great? That’s going to be the real test for the Galaxy Gear.” Both devices don’t have a flexible or curved display that some industry watchers had hoped to see on Samsung’s newest products. The Gear’s OLED touch screen features half the picture quality of high-end smartphone displays and the camera nestling in the strap has only 1.9 megapixels - compared with a 13-megapixel rear camera on the Galaxy S4. “People are really ready for flexible. As the smartphone market matures, brands are looking for something to break through new technology that will bring new opportunities to the market,” said Sweta Dash, director Display Research and Strategy at IHS Electronics and Media. “But the technology is not ready for the mass market because it is too expensive.” Samsung’s smartwatch will not be a game changer, CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood predicts. “Samsung will do a great job in raising the profile of this new category, but I don’t think we will see a massive shift.” “I think it will only really come alive if Apple would push into it real hard, because they would then make it a fashionable item.

203,QCOM,UPDATE 2-Qualcomm jumps into 'wearables' fray with Toq smartwatch,"* Qualcomm creates smartwatch to show off technology * Chipmaker hopes to encourage manufacturers to use its tech * Features low-power screen visible in sunlight By Noel Randewich SAN DIEGO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc has unveiled the Toq, a smartwatch that can play music and handle phone calls and messages, and said it would start selling the device in the fourth quarter, marking the chipmaker’s entry into the emerging arena of wearable computing. The company, which dominates the global market for applications processors for smartphones and tablets, introduced the device on Wednesday in a bid to showcase its own technology to manufacturers as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  unveiled its own much-anticipated “Galaxy Gear” in Berlin. The Korean company’s gadget also performs basic functions like calls, photos and messaging in concert with a smartphone. Apple Inc and Google Inc are also widely believed to be working on “wearables” such as wrist-worn devices, in what analysts expect to be the next phase of the mobile communications boom. The exploration of such wearable-computing devices has accelerated in recent years as smartphone growth tapers off. Qualcomm is using the watch, which works as a second display for a smartphone, to promote proprietary features including a low-power always-on display, wireless charging and stereo Bluetooth audio. “We are in conversation with partners and our hope is that if we make a great product now and continue to improve it, it will make their offerings better as well,” Anand Chandrasekher, Qualcomm’s chief marketing officer, told Reuters at the company’s annual developer event in San Diego. Qualcomm executives said they would divulge more details on how to buy a Toq later this month, and did not specify a price. Tech blog Cnet reported it will sell for $300, similar to Samsung’s $299 price tag for Gear. The U.S. company said its Google Android-compatible Toq will be the first smartwatch with a touch-enabled “Mirasol” color screen that can be easily be viewed in bright sunlight. Shares of Qualcomm gained 0.8 percent to close at $67.28 on the Nasdaq on Wednesday.

204,QCOM,New Formula E series gains two corporate sponsors,"LONDON (Reuters) - The new Formula E electric motor racing series has signed up technology company Qualcomm and logistics provider DHL as corporate sponsors before its launch next September. Californian company Qualcomm will be the official technology partner to the championship, while German-owned DHL will help to move cars and equipment between the 10 cities that will host races, officials said on Monday. The support of two major corporate backers from either side of the Atlantic is a boost for Formula E, a new series of races that will feature cars powered by electric energy scheduled for launch in September 2014. Races are due to be staged in the heart of major cities including London, Beijing and Los Angeles in a 10-team series that will offer a quieter contrast to the well established Formula One. Qualcomm will offer technology that will allow safety cars to be charged wirelessly in the first Formula E season and plans to make this available to race cars in subsequent years. “New technologies in connectivity, wireless and mobile fit perfectly with a Championship open to new technology, not only for the cars but for everything around the venue,” Alejandro Agag, chief executive of Formula E Holdings said in a statement. DHL, owned by Germany’s Deutsche Post, said its involvement with the new series mirrored a similar agreement it already had with Formula One to help it shift vehicles and other material from venue to venue. The new tasks would be taken on by the company’s existing motor sports team that operates from bases in Britain and Italy, a company spokesman said. The new series is attracting interest among Formula One teams who are keen to expand into new markets for engineering and technology. The Williams team have agreed to provide batteries for the new cars, while rival McLaren has signed up to provide engines, transmission and electronics.

206,QCOM,UPDATE 2-Supplier shares fall as Apple's 5C iPhone stirs doubts,"* Apple to sell lower-cost iPhone at $730 in China * Concerns iPhone 5C demand will be weak in emerging markets * Shares of U.S., Chinese, Japanese suppliers fall   (Adds U.S. supplier share movements, Apple’s share drop) By Dominic Lau and Clement Tan TOKYO/HONG KONG, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Shares of Apple Inc’s  component suppliers came under pressure on Wednesday as investors locked in recent gains on concerns that its lower-cost iPhone was still too expensive for its target audience in China and other emerging markets. Apple’s own shares were down more than 5 percent a day after it unveiled its flagship iPhone 5S with a fingerprint scanner to help it stand out among the smartest of phones. It also introduced the colourful 5C plastic model for emerging markets. The cheaper, plastic-backed iPhone 5C will sell for 4,488 yuan ($730) in China, almost $200 more than the United States retail price of $549 and only 800 yuan less than its top-of-the-line sibling, the 5S. “People were all expecting the 5C would be a low-cost model, but it doesn’t look like it will be too competitive now,” said Jackson Wong, Tanrich Securities vice president for equity sales in Hong Kong. “Everybody is now looking to the China Mobile announcement, which can happen anytime now.” Markets have been speculating that Apple is on the verge of signing a distribution pact with China Mobile Ltd, the country’s biggest wireless carrier with more than 740 million subscribers. China Mobile shares fell just under 1 percent in Hong Kong and about 3 percent in New York. Shares of component suppliers Broadcom Corp and Qualcomm Inc fell 2 and 3 percent respectively in New York while those of Cirrus Logic Inc, which gets about 82 percent of its revenue from Apple, fell as much as 5 percent. Brokerage Susquehanna Financial Group said that since the iPhone 5s’ connectivity features were not upgraded, Broadcom could experience pricing pressure. Broadcom is widely believed to be providing connectivity solutions for the new iPhone. Among Japanese component makers, Taiyo Yuden Co Ltd , Murata Manufacturing Co Ltd and Ibiden Co Ltd  dropped between 1.6 and 3.3 percent. Hong Kong-listed AAC Technologies Holdings Inc  sagged 4 percent. Goertek Inc, which supplies speakers to Apple, plunged the maximum 10 percent limit in Shenzhen, while Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd  eased a more modest 1.3 percent. Traders also said the cheaper model, which will go on sale on Friday and come in five colours - blue, green, pink, yellow and white - could crimp margins at suppliers. “In terms of components, it’s all a volume game with low margins. It’s not a huge positive for component makers,” a senior dealer at a foreign bank in Tokyo said. Apple has been losing ground to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in emerging markets like China and India. Other Japanese part suppliers that were hit on Tuesday included Mitsumi Electric Co Ltd, Japan Aviation Electronics Industry Ltd, Minebea Co Ltd, Alps Electric Co Ltd and Nidec Corp, off between 1 and 4.3 percent. Another Tokyo-based trader disagreed that margins were under threat, saying Apple has long been squeezing its part suppliers so if the tech giant can increase sales, it would benefit component makers as well. “It’s not negative for the component makers because it’s about volume. If anything, it is positive for component makers because you are now arguably going to be selling even more iPhones,” he said, adding that the selloff in the Japanese component makers offered buying opportunities. “The potential you’ve got here is not that you are going to be selling fewer iPhone 5S...What you are doing here is attacking a brand new market,” the trader said. “Now they have come up with a mid-range phone because there is a huge market for entry level smartphones.” According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, suppliers Taiyo Yuden, Murata and Ibiden were 14 to 37 percent below their intrinsic value, which evaluates a stock based on projected growth over the next decade, using a combination of analyst forecasts and industry growth expectations.

The court ruled that Qualcomm infringed on four patents of ParkerVision related to radio-frequency receivers and the conversion of electromagnetic signals in wireless devices and improperly used them in Qualcomm’s semiconductor chips. The trial is now in its second phase, to determine how much Qualcomm should pay as damages and whether the infringement was intentional, ParkerVision said. According to the pre-trial statement by the two companies in September, ParkerVision is seeking damages of nearly $500 million. If found guilty of willful patent infringement the damages awarded may be increased by up to three times. Qualcomm, the supplier of chips for Apple Inc’s iPhones and Android devices, was not immediately available for comment. Qualcomm’s chips are a key component in mobile phones and tablets as they help to convert frequencies of electromagnetic signals. ParkerVision shares were up 58 percent at $5.32 in late-afternoon trading. They hit a five-year high of $5.90. Shares of Qualcomm were down about 1 percent at $68.44. ParkerVision, which makes chips used in wireless communications, sued Qualcomm in July 2011, saying that Qualcomm infringed seven of its patents. In March 2013, the court denied Qualcomm’s motion to dismiss the company’s claims of indirect infringement.

215,QCOM,Qualcomm curbs spending as revenue guidance disappoints,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Wednesday forecast revenue below expectations and said it would curb fast-growing operating expenses, stoking concerns the leading mobile chipmaker faces tough competition in Asia, and sending its stock down. San Diego-based Qualcomm’s components are used in smartphones made by Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Inc and its patents pulling in revenue from licensees across the cellphone industry. But with growth in the smartphone industry shifting away from wealthy markets such as the United States and toward emerging economies such as China, analysts have been concerned that less expensive phones could impact Qualcomm’s profitability. Qualcomm posted double-digit growth in the fiscal fourth quarter for the 13th consecutive time, but its revenue forecast suggests the company’s explosive growth in recent years might be slowing as smaller competitors challenge it in Asia. “We know you can’t get the same royalty revenue off of a sub-$200 phone that you get off an iPhone or the Galaxy line,” said Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree. “We’re seeing evidence that the emerging-market impact is having pressure on revenue and earnings trends and it’s forcing the company to react and cut its spending.” Qualcomm said it operating expenses in fiscal 2014 would grow between 5 percent and 7 percent, much less than the 20 percent annual growth seen in the past three years. For fiscal 2014, Qualcomm expects the average selling prices of phones using its CDMA technology to be between $216 and $230, down about 1 percent from 2013. Average prices for cellphones in the June quarter, used to calculate licensing revenue for Qualcomm in the September quarter, were between $227 and $233, the company said. Qualcomm expects the second half of 2014 to be better than the first because of the anticipated launch in China of a high-speed wireless technology known as long-term evolution (LTE), an advanced cellphone standard in which Qualcomm is a leader. “With the upcoming launch of LTE, we expect increased demand for smartphones across many tiers of devices. It’s not just about smartphones,” Chief Executive Officer Paul Jacobs told analysts on a conference call. While the majority of Qualcomm’s revenue comes from selling baseband chips that let phones communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its ubiquitous CDMA cellphone technology. As phone prices edge lower, Qualcomm receives less revenue. Network operators worldwide are shifting to LTE, but other chipmakers are launching their own LTE chips and stepping up competition. Qualcomm shares are up about 7 percent year to date and trade at about 14 times expected earnings. Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc, a major player in low-end smartphones sold in Asia, has seen its shares jump over 30 percent in 2013 and they trade at 18 times expected earnings. Qualcomm said in its report on Wednesday that fiscal 2014 revenue would range from $27.5 billion to $26 billion, on the low end of analysts expectations of $27.5 billion. The chipmaker posted fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $6.48 billion, up 33 percent from the year-ago quarter. It had net income of $1.50 billion, up 18 percent. GAAP diluted earnings per share were 86 cents. Is non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.05. It said revenue in the fiscal first quarter, which ends in December, would range from $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion. Analysts on average had expected fourth-quarter revenue of $6.346 billion and first-quarter revenue of $6.989 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

For fiscal 2014, Qualcomm expects the average selling prices of phones using its CDMA technology to be between $216 and $230, down about 1 percent from 2013. Average prices for cellphones in the June quarter, used to calculate licensing revenue for Qualcomm in the September quarter, were between $227 and $233, the company said. Qualcomm expects the second half of 2014 to be better than the first because of the anticipated launch in China of a high-speed wireless technology known as long-term evolution (LTE), an advanced cellphone standard in which Qualcomm is a leader. “With the upcoming launch of LTE, we expect increased demand for smartphones across many tiers of devices. It’s not just about smartphones,” Chief Executive Officer Paul Jacobs told analysts on a conference call. While the majority of Qualcomm’s revenue comes from selling baseband chips that let phones communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its ubiquitous CDMA cellphone technology. As phone prices edge lower, Qualcomm receives less revenue. Network operators worldwide are shifting to LTE, but other chipmakers are launching their own LTE chips and stepping up competition. Qualcomm shares are up about 7 percent year to date and trade at about 14 times expected earnings. Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc , a major player in low-end smartphones sold in Asia, has seen its shares jump over 30 percent in 2013 and they trade at 18 times expected earnings. Qualcomm said in its report on Wednesday that fiscal 2014 revenue would range from $27.5 billion to $26 billion, on the low end of analysts expectations of $27.5 billion. The chipmaker posted fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $6.48 billion, up 33 percent from the year-ago quarter. It had net income of $1.50 billion, up 18 percent. GAAP diluted earnings per share were 86 cents. Is non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.05. It said revenue in the fiscal first quarter, which ends in December, would range from $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion. Analysts on average had expected fourth-quarter revenue of $6.346 billion and first-quarter revenue of $6.989 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The broader market was hurt by weak earnings from Whole Foods and Qualcomm. The European Central Bank’s decision to cut interest rates helped offset some of the negativity, however, said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. “My expectation was that there would be some profit-taking” after markets made gains on Wednesday, he said. Shares of Twitter surged 77 percent to $45.98 from its $26 IPO price, after at one point reaching $50.09 a share. “This crowns Twitter probably as the most expensive IPO on a price-to-sales metric ever,” said Channing Smith, managing director at Capital Advisors in Tulsa, Oklahoma. “With this multiple, you’re leaning on everything going right,” Smith said. The rest of the market was more downbeat. Qualcomm  shares fell 4.6 percent to $66.59, the biggest drag on both the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes after the company forecast revenue below expectations.

Stock futures had jumped early in the day after the European Central Bank cut interest rates, responding to a slump in inflation that sparked fears the euro zone’s economic recovery could stall. The ECB move reinforced expectations global central banks will continue to buoy struggling economies. Separately, data showed that the U.S. economy grew 2.8 percent in the third quarter, but that estimate, which will be revised, was affected by a larger-than-expected build-up of inventories, which tends to subtract from growth later on. Initial jobless claims fell 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 336,000 last week, roughly in line with expectations. Those reports, as well as Friday’s much-anticipated jobs numbers, will give investors some insight into how long the Fed will keep buying $85 billion a month in bonds.

Unveiling his new capital return commitment, Jacobs said Qualcomm would increase dividends faster than earnings and continue repurchases as well. Many investors have called for the debt-free and cash-flush company to distribute more profits to shareholders and make firm commitments rather than occasional buybacks. Its plans for capital returns have been a major question for analysts going into this year’s investor day in New York. “I was looking for something systematic rather than one-time - seems like we’ve got that,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Qualcomm is among a growing number of technology companies, including Yahoo Inc and Microsoft Corp, that investors have urged to pay out more capital as earnings growth loses steam. Activist investor Carl Icahn has urged Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook since August to buy back $150 billion in stock. In fiscal 2013, Qualcomm returned $6.7 billion, or 86 percent of free cash flow, to shareholders in the form of $2.1 billion in dividends and $4.6 billion of repurchased stock. That percentage of cash return is a bit above average for companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index, according to Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri. Earlier this month, Qualcomm committed to buy back $4 billion in shares in fiscal 2014 and pay $2.5 billion in dividends, but some on Wall Street wanted the chipmaker to make a long-term capital return commitment. At the end of September, Qualcomm had $8 billion in cash onshore. It also had $21 billion offshore, which was held by foreign subsidiaries and would be taxed if the company brings it to the United States. Qualcomm’s shares traded down 0.1 percent after Jacobs’ described the capital return plan. They are up 16 percent year to date, less than the S&P; 500’s 27 percent increase. Earlier on Wednesday, Qualcomm announced a handful of new chips for mobile and networking gadgets ahead of the investor event, where analysts are concerned about a shift in smartphone growth from the United States to China and other developing countries. Qualcomm said the fourth generation of its Long-Term Evolution chip, used for fast data transfer in top-tier smartphones, would begin sampling by manufacturing customers early next year. Qualcomm is the world’s leading mobile chipmaker and is far ahead of Intel Corp and smaller rivals in LTE technology. With growth in the smartphone industry shifting away from wealthy markets such as the United States and toward China and other emerging economies, Wall Street has been concerned that less-expensive phones may affect Qualcomm’s ability to sell high-end chips and hurt its profitability. This month, Qualcomm said it would curb fast-growing operating expenses and release new chips a little less often as it focuses more on less-costly devices.

228,QCOM,Qualcomm faces antitrust probe in China,"(Reuters) - Chinese regulators have launched an anti-trust investigation into Qualcomm, the U.S. mobile chipmaker said on Monday, and some experts suggested China’s government may be seeking leverage in royalty negotiations. China’s largest cellphone carrier is preparing a major move to 4G wireless technology next year, and Qualcomm has been hoping that will provide it with a major new source of royalty revenue. The company said it was not aware of any antitrust violations but would cooperate with the probe by China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The NDRC did not say why the company was being investigated, according to Qualcomm. China’s state media on Sunday quoted an NDRC official saying regulators would focus antitrust investigations on six industries, ranging from technology to medicine. Qualcomm, the world’s biggest maker of cellphone chips, sees China as a key market as growth in smartphones shifts away from the United States to developing countries. China Mobile has been preparing to upgrade to high-speed networks using technology developed by Qualcomm. The U.S. company reported $12.3 billion in revenue from China in the 12 months through September, equal to 49 percent of its total revenue. But many of the smartphones made in China are exported, so the Chinese market actually accounts for about a fifth of Qualcomm’s chip shipments and licensing revenue, according to Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt. Some analysts speculate China’s antitrust investigation may be an attempt to gain leverage in royalty negotiations with Qualcomm ahead of the expected rollout of new 4G wireless infrastructure in 2014. Analysts also theorized that Beijing may be moving to support local suppliers trying to compete with Qualcomm, the global leader in 4G technology, also known as Long-Term Evolution (LTE). In February, the NDRC attracted attention when it fined six Korean and Taiwanese makers of liquid crystal displays about $57 million for price fixing. With Broadcom Corp, Intel Corp and other chipmakers missing targets for the their own LTE components, Qualcomm is the main player in LTE, which China Mobile plans to roll out next year to allow for faster data transfer rates over cellphones. “We suspect this investigation is related to the forthcoming launch of TD-LTE by China Mobile in early 2014 and the negotiations on chip pricing and license pricing between Qualcomm and Chinese-based handset (manufacturers) that are likely occurring right now,” McCourt wrote in an note to clients. A Qualcomm spokesman declined to comment but at the company’s annual investor day last week, CEO Paul Jacobs and other senior executives focused on China and the upcoming LTE rollout there as big opportunities to sell more smartphone chips and collect new royalties as LTE is implemented. With growth in the smartphone industry shifting away from wealthy markets toward China, Qualcomm and other U.S. chipmakers have increased their focus on supplying components for low-cost phones. And they are competing more with local chipmakers. A new wave of Asian smartphone makers has also emerged to help meet demand for low-end handsets: companies such as Lenovo Group Ltd, ZTE Corp and Xiaomi Tech, the rising star of cheap, made-in-China smartphones. The Chinese government appears to be pushing for local technology suppliers, said Evercore Partners analyst Mark McKechnie. In the last few months, organizations affiliated with the Chinese government spent nearly $3 billion to buy Chinese mobile chipmakers Spreadtrum Communications Inc and RDA Microelectronics Inc. Both companies have technology that competes with Qualcomm’s. China Mobile, the world’s biggest mobile carrier with 800 million subscribers, is investing billions of dollars to upgrade its infrastructure to LTE so clients can enjoy speedier Internet and data access. “You’re getting ready to have this battle over 4G royalties and now you have this antitrust investigation,” said Williams Financial analyst Cody Acree. “It may well be that this reform commission is beginning to throw up reasons and excuses for why China doesn’t pay royalties on 4G.” The NDRC is China’s top economic planning body and regulates prices. It has launched nearly 20 pricing-related probes of domestic and foreign firms in the last three years, according to official media reports and research published by law firms. The NDRC fined six companies, including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co, Danone SA and New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra, a total of $110 million in August following a four-month investigation into price fixing and anti-competitive practices by foreign makers of baby formula. In August, sources told Reuters that a senior Chinese official had put pressure on about 30 foreign firms, including General Electric Co and Siemens, to admit to antitrust violations and warned them against using external lawyers to fight accusations from regulators. Shares of San Diego-based Qualcomm closed 0.64 percent lower at $72.49 on the Nasdaq. Infrastructure spending on 4G will nearly triple to $24.3 billion in 2013 from $8.7 billion in 2012, according to research firm IHS iSuppli, fueled by network expansions in major markets such as China, Japan and Germany.

232,QCOM,China probe may be aimed at Qualcomm's 4G royalties,"(Reuters) - China’s anti-trust investigation into Qualcomm, the world’s biggest smartphone chip maker, is likely tied to the impending $16 billion rollout of commercial fourth-generation services by China’s big telecoms carriers. The probe by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s top economic planning body and price regulator, is a likely pre-emptive measure that will allow China’s telecom providers to gain leverage in royalty negotiations ahead of the rollout of new high-speed mobile networks, analysts said. China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom are investing more than 100 billion yuan ($16.4 billion) in system equipment for the next-generation wireless networks, which are expected to be introduced nationwide over the coming year. Qualcomm is positioned to reap the vast majority of licensing fees for the chip sets used by handsets in the world’s biggest smartphone market, providing the San Diego-based chipmaker with a fresh source of royalties. “This is a big deal for Qualcomm,” said Alen Lin, a telecoms analyst at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong. “For the first 6-9 months Qualcomm will be the only chipset provider that can support a handset using both 3G and 4G in the China market.” China is a key market for Qualcomm as smartphone growth shifts from the United States to developing countries. Qualcomm reported $12.3 billion in revenue from China in the 12 months through September, almost half its total revenue. Many of the smartphones made in China are exported, however, so the Chinese market actually accounts for about a fifth of Qualcomm’s chip shipments and licensing revenue, according to Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt.

234,QCOM,Qualcomm plans smartphone chips with 64-bit technology,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc said on Monday it will make smartphone chips with 64-bit features typically found in personal computers, following Apple Inc and opening the way to more efficient mobile gadgets. Qualcomm said its new Snapdragon 410 component will also include 4G cellphone connectivity technology and be aimed at the fast-growing Chinese market, where it should start appearing in low-cost smartphones in the second half of 2014. Along with 4G, 64-bit technology will become standard across Qualcomm’s products, said Michelle Leyden Li, a Qualcomm senior director in charge of marketing its Snapdragon line. Led by Apple’s iPhones, the smartphone industry’s evolution toward 64-bit chips reduces the gap between low-power mobile processors and punchier chips used in laptops, desktop PCs and servers. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has also said it plans to use 64-bit processors in its smartphones. Processors with 64-bit features can take advantage of more memory than 32-bit processors now found in most mobile devices, potentially letting them work faster and more efficiently. Current smartphones don’t have enough memory to give 64-bit processors an advantage of 32-bit chips, but future phones probably will include enough memory to give the 64-bit processors a performance boost. Taking advantage of 64-bit processors also requires changes to software originally designed for 32-bit processors. “It’s a little bit chicken and the egg,” Leyden Li said. “We see this transition happening and we want to be there to help enable the ecosystem.” In September, Apple unveiled its first iPhone made with a 64-bit processor, leading to speculation the company plans to merge its iOS mobile platform with the operating system used for its Mac laptop and desktop personal computers. Future Macs could be built with the same line of chips Apple that uses in its iPhones and iPads. Intel Corp already includes 64-bit features in its mobile chips but the company’s “x86” architecture has failed to catch on in smartphones and tablets. A competing, low-power architecture has been licensed to chipmakers by Arm Holdings Plc and has become ubiquitous in devices.

The official English-language China Daily attributed the comment to Xu Kunlin, head of the National Development and Reform Commission’s (NDRC) anti-price-fixing bureau, in the agency’s first public comment on the case. The report gave no further details. A China-based public relations official for Qualcomm said the company had no comment on Xu’s remarks. Qualcomm, the world’s biggest maker of cellphone chips, said in November that it would cooperate with the NDRC in an antitrust investigation, though it was unaware of any anti-monopoly law violations. The NDRC has been stepping up its crackdown on anti-monopoly violations over the past several months. It handed down record fines to six milk powder companies, including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co and Danone, in August and has also punished domestic jewelers for antitrust violations. Xu was also quoted as saying the agency would add at least 170 people to its price-fixing enforcement teams as it redoubles efforts to tame anti-competitive behavior in major industries, including the automotive sector. Twenty of those employees will join its Beijing office, boosting its size from its current 46 employees, the China Daily said. The expansion “reflects the country’s determination to deal with price fixing”, the newspaper said. Xu also called for the merger of his bureau with antitrust divisions at the Ministry of Commerce and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, two agencies with which it has “overlapping” duties.

Qualcomm shares were flat at $72.73 on Nasdaq, suggesting investors saw little impact from the change. Jacobs, who replaced his father Irwin as Qualcomm CEO in 2005, will serve as executive chairman and focus on developing new technology and long-term opportunities, the company said. “Paul is a visionary guy and Mollenkopf really knows how to run things. So I think this division of labor makes a ton of sense, although it’s a little earlier than I would have expected,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.

The replacement of current CEO Paul Jacobs, the 51-year-old son of a Qualcomm co-founder, comes a day after Bloomberg News reported that Microsoft has been considering Mollenkopf as a candidate to replace retiring CEO Steve Ballmer. “Obviously Paul is still a very young man, so (this is) not something that many of us were expecting but something that has likely been in the works for some time,” said Williams Financial Group analyst Cody Acree. “I think the consideration of Microsoft of Mollenkopf may have prompted a bit of a speedier announcement.” Mollenkopf, 44, will take the reins at the world’s biggest maker of cellphone chips in March, as Qualcomm faces an antitrust investigation in China, its largest market. At least one investment fund has been pushing for a return of capital to shareholders, among other options. The company had a cash pile of $29.4 billion as of Sept. 29. Qualcomm shares were up 0.7 percent at $73.21 in late-morning trading on the Nasdaq, suggesting investors saw little impact from the unexpected change of CEO. “We believe that Mollenkopf had effectively been running the day-to-day operations of the company, so we don’t expect daily operations to change materially,” JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall said in an email. Mollenkopf led Qualcomm’s $3.1 billion acquisition of radio frequency chipmaker Atheros Communications Inc in 2011, its biggest acquisition. An engineer, he will replace Jacobs on March 4, after the annual shareholder meeting. Jacobs has been CEO since 2005, taking over from his father Irwin who co-founded Qualcomm in 1985.

Mollenkopf focuses mostly on the semiconductor side of the business, said Argus Research analyst Jim Kelleher. “If anything, Mollenkopf in the lead means (an) intense commitment to the semi business,” he said. Morningstar analyst Brian Colello said the appointment brought important continuity to Qualcomm’s chip leadership team at a time when its dominance in almost all high-end phones faces challenges from the likes of Intel Corp. The antitrust investigation in China will be a key concern for the new CEO.

Investors have been trying to gauge the timing of when the U.S. central bank may begin to scale back its stimulus measures, with many market participants expecting the Fed to announce a tapering of its monthly bond purchases in March. However, recent signs of strength in economic data have led some investors to be wary of the possibility of an earlier pullback by the Fed, which holds a two-day policy meeting next week. “The last couple of days selloff with (bond) yields rising a little bit definitely tells you the taper talk is back, and people are starting to build a little of that into it,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. “You have a lot of guys who are sitting back; maybe they are up, averages are better, so why risk it here?” Economic data on Friday showed producer prices declined in November for a third straight month, indicating a lack of inflation that could give the Federal Reserve pause regarding the stimulus. The S&P; 500 fell 1.8 percent over the previous three sessions, putting the benchmark index on track for its worst weekly decline since the end of August. The index is up nearly 25 percent for the year, largely fueled by the Fed’s stimulus. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.51 points or 0.17 percent, to 15,765.94. The S&P; 500 gained 1.83 points or 0.1 percent, to 1,777.33. The Nasdaq Composite  added 7.643 points or 0.19 percent, to 4,006.045. Adobe Systems Inc jumped 11.4 percent to $60.10, giving the biggest boost to both the S&P; 500 and the Nasdaq 100  indexes after the maker of Photoshop and Acrobat software forecast current-quarter results below analysts’ estimates, but reported a surge in the number of subscribers to its Creative Cloud suite from the previous quarter. Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc said Chief Operating Officer Steve Mollenkopf will become its chief executive officer in March, replacing Paul Jacobs, who will be executive chairman. Qualcomm shares rose 0.3 percent to $72.95. In the energy sector, shares of Anadarko Petroleum Corp  slumped 8 percent to $76.97 a day after a U.S. judge ruled that Anadarko and its Kerr-McGee unit acted with “intent to hinder” when they spun off Tronox, a paint materials company that later went bankrupt. The judge ruled that Anadarko and Kerr-McGee should pay billions of dollars in environmental cleanup costs. The decision had been awaited for about a year since a trial wrapped up in late 2012.

Data showing a third straight month of decline in producer prices supported the day’s gains as it pointed to a lack of inflation that could give the Federal Reserve pause as it weighs the future of its monthly bond purchases. Investors have been concerned that recent signs of strength in the economy may persuade the Fed, which holds a two-day policy meeting next week, to soon scale back its market-friendly stimulus. “The market is digesting a three-day decline, taking a pause from the selloff. Once we get the Fed news out of the way next week, then I expect the seasonal factor to kick in and we may see historical highs again leading up to the new year,” said Ryan Detrick, analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. Despite the day’s gains, the S&P; 500 index was on track to end the week lower. The benchmark was now set for its worst decline since the end of August. Global equities were headed for their biggest two-week drop since June and the dollar hit 5-year highs against the yen on Friday amid concern U.S. stimulus may be wound down following the Fed policy meeting on Dec. 17-18. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.97 points or 0.03 percent, to 15,744.4, the S&P; 500 gained 0.87 points or 0.05 percent, to 1,776.37 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 8.994 points or 0.22 percent, to 4,007.397.

243,QCOM,"UPDATE 1-China official says has ""substantial"" evidence in Qualcomm antitrust case - media","* Qualcomm: believes its practices are lawful * Qualcomm: will continue to cooperate fully with NRDC * China to add 170 people to anti-price fixing offices By Michael Martina BEIJING, Dec 12 (Reuters) - China’s top economic planning agency has “substantial evidence” against chipmaker Qualcomm Inc  in an antitrust probe, state media on Thursday quoted a senior official at the price regulator as saying. The official English-language China Daily attributed the comment to Xu Kunlin, head of the National Development and Reform Commission’s (NDRC) anti-price-fixing bureau, in the agency’s first public comment on the case. The report gave no further details. Qualcomm, the world’s biggest maker of cellphone chips, said it believed its business practices were “lawful and pro-competitive”. The company will continue to cooperate fully with the NDRC and is looking forward to a first meeting with the agency, Christine Trimble, Qualcomm’s vice president for public affairs said in an emailed statement. Qualcomm sees China as a key market as growth in smartphones shifts away from the United States to developing countries and as China Mobile prepares to upgrade to high-speed networks using technology developed by Qualcomm. The NDRC has been stepping up its anti-monopoly enforcement over the past several months. It handed down record fines to six milk powder companies, including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co  and Danone, in August and has also punished domestic jewellers for antitrust violations. Xu was also quoted as saying the agency would add at least 170 people to its price-fixing enforcement teams as it redoubles efforts to tame anti-competitive behaviour in major industries, including the automotive sector. Twenty of those employees will join its Beijing office, boosting its size from its current 46 employees, the China Daily said. The expansion “reflects the country’s determination to deal with price fixing”, the newspaper said. Xu also called for the merger of his bureau with antitrust divisions at the Ministry of Commerce and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, two agencies with which it has “overlapping” duties. Experts have argued that China’s antitrust enforcers are woefully understaffed even as they embrace new-found global clout in regulating monopolistic practices and mergers. China is trying to restructure the economy so that growth is driven by consumption and antitrust agencies have said they will target industries where practices could lead to “unreasonably” high consumer prices. Regulators have said they will focus on six sectors - aerospace, chemicals, automobiles, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals and home appliances.",12132013,http://www.reuters.com/article/china-antitrust/update-1-china-official-says-has-substantial-evidence-in-qualcomm-antitrust-case-media-idUSL3N0JS0GQ20131213

The world’s biggest software company is down to a “handful” of candidates with no clear leader, including a hitherto unconsidered technology executive, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters this week. In the past few months, most attention has focused on Ford Motor Co CEO Alan Mulally, a friend of Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s current CEO who announced his plans to retire earlier this year. Mulally is credited with rescuing the beleaguered auto giant, but sources said an external tech executive is in the running, plus one or two internal executives. Microsoft declined comment on its CEO search, and Qualcomm declined comment on Mollenkopf’s potential candidacy. People familiar with the process expect Microsoft to select a new CEO before the end of the year, although the committee formed to find Ballmer’s successor gave itself 12 months to do its work when it was formed in August. Mulally, who helped Ballmer create his ‘One Microsoft’ overhaul and has seemed so far to be the most likely candidate to succeed him, is under pressure this week from Ford’s board to clarify his plans. “I love serving Ford,” Mulally told Reuters on Thursday, without addressing the speculation surrounding him. Mollenkopf, an engineer who holds several wireless patents and has risen to the top management ranks at Qualcomm since joining the company in 1994, appears to meet the requirements of the Microsoft CEO job laid out by Chairman Bill Gates last month.

China’s powerful National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is investigating InterDigital for violating Chinese anti-monopoly law, the company said in a securities filing on Oct. 31. The NDRC told InterDigital it had initiated the investigation because the company had filed a complaint to the U.S. International Trade Commission against Chinese companies, alleging patent infringement, InterDigital said in a letter addressed to Chinese officials that was seen by Reuters. The company has been locked in a legal battle over patent royalty rates it has been seeking from Chinese network equipment maker Huawei Technologies. NDRC officials were not immediately available for comment on the investigation, which InterDigital says it has fully cooperated with until now. “We are simply unable to comply with any investigation that is accompanied by a threat to the safety of our executives,” InterDigital Chief Executive William Merritt said in a statement on Monday. InterDigital, which has a market capitalization of about $1.3 billion, makes money from licensing its portfolio of technology patents. The NDRC has been stepping up its anti-monopoly enforcement this year. The agency handed down record fines to six milk powder companies, including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co  and Danone, and has also punished domestic jewelers for antitrust violations. It is also investigating Qualcomm Inc, another large U.S. holder of mobile patents. In October, the Guangdong High Court awarded Huawei 20 million yuan ($3.3 million) after a legal battle between the Chinese network gear maker and InterDigital. Shenzhen-based Huawei claimed InterDigital charged it a royalty rate far above what it obtained from Apple Inc  and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. InterDigital said it expects the U.S. trade agency verdict on its complaint be issued on Dec. 19, a day after the scheduled meeting with the Chinese authorities. Chinese officials want to meet Merritt, but he replied in the letter to the NDRC that he was unable to attend the meeting because of a company board meeting. In the letter, the company said its Chinese lawyer was told by NDRC that it would not ensure the safety of executives it planned to send to China in place of Merritt and they may be arrested or detained. InterDigital is also involved in a regulatory row in the United States, where it is a member of an alliance of patent holders opposed to a bill in Congress aimed at reining in “patent trolls,” companies that buy or license patents from others then seek licensing fees from technology companies.",12162013,http://www.reuters.com/article/interdigital-china/interdigital-execs-fear-arrest-wont-meet-china-antitrust-agency-idUSL3N0JV10020131216
249,QCOM,ASE's clients may slash orders after plant said to pollute -reports,"TAIPEI, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc and other clients of Advanced Semiconductor Engineering Inc (ASE)  have started to consider shifting some of their business elsewhere after the Taiwanese company’s main plant was accused of polluting a river, local media said on Monday. Shares in ASE, the world’s top chip packaging and testing firm, slid 6.5 percent on Monday after the newspaper reports. They have lost 14 percent since early last week when news about the plant broke. Local government officials have said they want to shut company’s main plant in southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung, accusing the company of discharging water contaminated by heavy metals into a river. Kaohsiung prosecutors have also said they want to question ASE Chairman Jason Chang. Qualcomm and MediaTek Inc have started looking at shifting orders to ASE’s smaller rivals such as Siliconware Precision Industries Co Ltd and Amkor Technology Inc , the Commercial Times and the Economic Daily newspapers said, citing unidentified industry sources. Qualcomm could not be reached for comment, while Mediatek said they had no comment. ASE said last week that its test results for the water from the plant had differed from those of government officials as the tests were taken at different times. The company has said it did not falsify the test results. Representatives for ASE officials were not immediately available for comment on Monday.

Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Mollenkopf said Qualcomm had no specific microserver products to announce, but he left the door open to a future move into the data center and cloud computing. “I think there’s going to be a tremendous amount of growth in computing and resources dedicated to supporting the cloud,” Mollenkopf said in response to a question. “We look at that as an opportunity for a company like ours.” Qualcomm is the leading mobile chipmaker and a potential move into microservers could create a formidable challenge to smaller companies, like Advanced Micro Devices, working on their own microserver chips.

253,QCOM,Qualcomm CEO says still in the dark on China antitrust probe,"LAS VEGAS, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Qualcomm’s CEO Paul Jacobs said on Wednesday that the U.S. mobile chipmaker still has not been notified about why it has come under antitrust scrutiny in China since late last year. In November, Qualcomm announced that China’s National Development and Reform Commission had launched an antitrust probe into the company. The chipmaker said it was unaware of any possible violations. “We really don’t know yet,” Jacobs told Reuters in an interview at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. He added that it is not unusual for authorities in various countries not to disclose reasons for their antitrust probes. Qualcomm has since handed over requested documents to the NDRC. The NDRC has launched nearly 20 pricing-related probes of domestic and foreign firms in the last three years, according to official media and research published by law firms. In December, state media quoted a senior official at the NDRC saying the regulator had “substantial evidence” against the chipmaker. Some experts have suggested China’s government may be seeking leverage in royalty negotiations or moving to support local suppliers trying to compete with Qualcomm, the global leader in 4G technology, also known as Long-Term Evolution (LTE). In the last few months, organizations affiliated with the Chinese government spent nearly $3 billion to buy Chinese mobile chipmakers Spreadtrum Communications Inc and RDA Microelectronics Inc. Both companies have technology that competes with Qualcomm’s. “We’re good with the operators because we help the operators out a lot,” Jacobs said. “China has a couple of chipset manufacturers that just got bought by a government university so there are all sorts of dynamics going on.” Qualcomm, the world’s biggest maker of cellphone chips, sees China as a key market as growth in smartphones shifts away from the United States to developing countries. China Mobile has been preparing to upgrade to high-speed networks using technology developed by Qualcomm. “I wouldn’t single out any particular company at this point but we definitely have friends and we definitely have companies that we know are more antagonistic,” said Jacobs, who will step aside as Qualcomm’s CEO in March. He will be replaced by Chief Operating Officer Steve Mollenkopf.",1092014,http://www.reuters.com/article/qualcomm-china/qualcomm-ceo-says-still-in-the-dark-on-china-antitrust-probe-idUSL2N0KJ0DV20140109
254,QCOM,Qualcomm acquires patents from HP to bulk up portfolio,"(Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc acquired a patent portfolio from Hewlett-Packard Co, including those of Palm Inc and its iPaq smartphone, in a move that will bulk up HP’s offerings to handset makers and other licensees. The portfolio comprises about 1,400 granted patents and pending patent applications from the United States and about 1,000 granted patents and pending patent applications from other countries, including China, England, Germany, Japan and South Korea. The San Diego-based chipmaker did not say how much it paid for the patents. The majority of Qualcomm’s profits come from licensing patents for its ubiquitous CDMA cellphone technology and other technology related to mobile devices. Instead of licensing patents individually, handset vendors, carriers and other licensees pay royalties to Qualcomm in return for access to a broad portfolio of intellectual property. The patents bought from HP, announced in a release on Thursday, cover technologies that include fundamental mobile operating system techniques. They include those that HP acquired when it bought Palm Inc, an early player in mobile devices, in 2010 and Bitfone in 2006. HP tablets made using Palm’s webOS operating system failed to catch on. “There’s nothing left at Palm that HP could get any use out of so it’s better to sell the patents, which are always valuable to Qualcomm,” said Ed Snyder, an analyst with Charter Equity Research. “They have to keep that bucket full.” The new patents will not lead to increased royalty rates for existing Qualcomm licensees, a Qualcomm spokeswoman said.

Bucking the day’s trend and limiting gains on the Nasdaq and S&P; 500, shares of Apple Inc dropped 7.7 percent to $507.63, a day after holiday iPhone sales missed expectations. Shares of Pfizer boosted both the Dow and S&P; 500 after its better-than-expected quarterly profit. The market rebound came after heavy losses tied to concerns about withdrawal of U.S. monetary stimulus as well as worries about emerging markets, including slowing Chinese growth and political turmoil from Turkey to Thailand. Last week, the S&P; 500 marked its worst percentage loss since June 2012. “Maybe some relief of the selling pressures is the cause for the rally,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Market participants were looking at recent soft economic data, a mixed earnings season and concerns about what’s happening in non-U.S. equity markets, he said. As a result,  “there is a growing collection of wisdom the Fed may postpone its tapering regime tomorrow.” Orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods unexpectedly fell 4.3 percent in December, and a gauge of planned business spending on capital goods also slid, which could cast a shadow on an otherwise bright economic outlook.

Neutral investors don’t know what to expect.” The S&P; 500 has declined for three consecutive sessions on concerns about more withdrawal of U.S. monetary stimulus and slowing Chinese growth, which amplified country-specific political turmoil from Turkey to Thailand.

260,QCOM,RPT-UPDATE 2-European chipmaker STMicro expects return to profit in 2014,"* STMicro aims to outperform market in 2014 - CEO * Sees drop in first-quarter revenue * Says orders jumped 20 pct between Q3 and Q4 By Gwénaëlle Barzic PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - European chipmaker STMicroelectronics forecast a return to profit in 2014 after suffering two years of losses, hit by a decline in orders from phone maker Nokia. The Franco-Italian company, whose chips are used in cars, computers and mobile phones, posted a ninth straight quarterly loss but said it expects this year to outperform market growth forecasts, currently around 4.2 percent. It said its performance would be boosted by an improved order book, cost cuts and having exited its loss-making ST-Ericsson joint-venture with telecom network gear maker Ericsson last year. “We are definitely positive on generating a profit in the fiscal year 2014,” Chief Financial Officer Carlo Ferro told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday. Orders jumped 20 percent between the third and fourth quarter of 2013, Chief Executive Carlo Bozotti said. STMicro is the eighth-largest semiconductor maker by global sales but has lost ground to rivals like Qualcomm, Intel and Samsung in recent years because of its higher cost base and difficulties suffered by Nokia, once its largest customer. In the past year, it has particularly focused on cars, high-end smartphones and motion sensors but that move has yet to pay off in terms of profit. For the fourth quarter of 2013, the company reported an operating loss of $11 million on revenue of $2.01 billion, broadly in line with analysts’ forecasts. That compared with a loss of $730 million on revenue of $2.16 billion in the same period of 2012. It said it expected 2014 first-quarter revenue to fall by about 9.5 percent on a quarterly basis, plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, due to its exit from the ST-Ericsson joint-venture.

261,QCOM,STMicro's fourth-quarter revenue stagnates,"(Reuters) - STMicroelectronics NV (STM.PA) posted lower quarterly revenue and a narrow loss on Monday underscoring how the European chipmaker is losing ground to rivals as orders from its key customer Nokia NOK1V.HE shrink. The company, whose chips are used in cars, computers and mobile phones, reported an operating loss of $11 million on fourth-quarter revenue of $2.01 billion. The revenue was lower than the $2.1 billion logged a year ago but largely unchanged from the previous quarter. Analysts had forecast revenues of $2.03 billion on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company had earlier predicted that fourth-quarter sales would be unchanged from the prior three months, plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. After a loss-making third quarter, STMicro pushed back a key profit margin target by six months, blaming higher sales of chips for low-end mobile phones that are not as profitable as chips for high-end phones like Apple’s iPhone or Samsung’s Galaxy line. Last year, STMicro and telecom network gear maker Ericsson ended their joint venture to make chips for mobile phones. Since then, STMicro has refocused on product lines for automobiles, video game consoles, and high-end smartphones, but that move has yet to pay off in terms of higher profits. Franco-Italian STMicro is the eighth-largest semiconductor maker by global sales, but has lost ground to rivals like Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Intel (INTC.O) and Samsung (005930.KS) in recent years because of its higher cost base and the decline of Nokia. Worldwide semiconductor revenue rose 5.2 percent last year to $315.4 billion from $299.9 billion in 2012, according to market research group Gartner. Intel kept the leading spot by sales, despite lower demand for computers that caused its chip sales to fall 2.2 percent, while Samsung and Qualcomm both notched up growth, according to Gartner. STMicroelectronics shares climbed 8.8 percent last year, while Europe’s Stoxx 600 technology index .SX8P rose 27 percent.

262,QCOM,"Qualcomm posts higher first-quarter revenue, says year on track","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc posted higher fiscal first-quarter revenue that slightly missed expectations as smartphone growth shifted to China but it bumped up its full-year earnings outlook on the strong start to 2014. With growth in the smartphone industry moving away from wealthy markets such as the United States and toward China and other emerging economies, where consumers favor less expensive devices, Qualcomm has been focusing on costs to preserve its profit margins. Qualcomm slightly raised its full-year forecast for earnings per share to a range of $5.00 to $5.20, from $4.95 to $5.15, essentially adjusting for first-quarter earnings that came in above the company’s own previous estimate. “We raised the full-year EPS guidance but really just to reflect the positive results of Q1. We see the rest of the year playing out pretty much in line with our original expectations,” Chief Financial Officer George Davis said in an interview. Qualcomm had first-quarter net income of $1.88 billion, down 2 percent. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.09. Its non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.26, above its previous forecast of between $1.10 and $1.20. On Monday, lower-than-expected holiday iPhone sales and a weak revenue forecast by Apple Inc renewed fears on Wall Street about Chinese demand and a tepid global market. While the majority of Qualcomm’s revenue comes from selling baseband chips that let phones communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its ubiquitous CDMA cellphone technology. As phone prices edge lower, Qualcomm receives less royalty revenue. Average prices for cellphones in the September quarter, used to calculate licensing revenue for Qualcomm in the December quarter, were between $219 and $225, the company said.

265,QCOM,Qualcomm faces prospect of record antitrust fines in China,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc, the world’s biggest cellphone chip maker, may be hit with a record fine exceeding $1 billion in a Chinese antitrust probe, raising the specter of harsh penalties for foreign firms facing an increasingly aggressive regulator. China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) initiated an investigation into Qualcomm last year and is currently holding talks with the U.S. company, which this month said it was still in the dark about the basis of the scrutiny. The probe and the potential fine - the amount of which could hinge on negotiations - come as the NDRC zooms in on information technology providers, especially companies that license patent technology for mobile devices and networks. Industry experts say the NDRC, the government’s main economic planning body, is trying to lower domestic costs as China rolls out its faster 4G mobile networks this year. “It is, in some ways, a game of chicken,” said Yee Wah Chin, a New York-based antitrust expert at law firm Ingram, Yuzek, Gainen, Carroll and Bertolotti. “While the (fine) money may be very attractive to the NDRC, they would also be happy if Qualcomm were to make all sorts of commitments regarding its technology and the licensing of the technology,” she told Reuters. San Diego-based Qualcomm, which is scheduled to report quarterly results later on Wednesday, is positioned to reap the vast majority of licensing fees for the chip sets used by handsets in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market. Chinese telecom firms may invest as much as 100 billion yuan ($16.4 billion) in equipment for 4G networks. Under the anti-monopoly law, the NDRC can impose fines of between 1 and 10 percent of a company’s revenues for the previous year. Qualcomm earned $12.3 billion in China for its fiscal year ended September 29, or nearly half of its global sales. Lawyers say the fine is likely to be extremely high if Qualcomm fails to make concessions in its talks with the NDRC. “We intend to continue cooperating fully with the NDRC,” Qualcomm spokeswoman Christine Trimble said when asked about the probe. In December, the head of the NDRC’s anti-price-fixing bureau told state media there was “substantial evidence” against Qualcomm in the antitrust probe. Details, however, remain sketchy. The Qualcomm probe is a prime example of the uncertainty foreign firms are grappling with as China’s regulators target key industries to shield consumers from practices that could lead to what they call “unreasonably” high prices. It also shows the NDRC’s seriousness in using its antitrust rules. In 2011, the agency imposed one of its first major penalties against a foreign company, a $300,000 fine on Unilever Plc for violations of the pricing law. The NDRC has also slapped Chinese and foreign companies with investigations and fines in the past year. In August, the regulator fined six infant formula manufacturers, including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co, Danone and Fonterra, a record $110 million after a probe into price fixing and anti-competitive practices. The anti-monopoly law provision does not specify whether the 10 percent ceiling for fines applies to global or domestic sales, or to a particular product line. At the lowest legal threshold, the fines on Qualcomm could surpass those in the infant formula cases. Fines at the top of the range would put the Qualcomm case on par with major antitrust rulings in the United States and Europe. “They (NDRC) keep as much discretion for the decision maker as possible,” said Peter Wang, a China-based antitrust expert with law firm Jones Day. “Technically it would appear they can’t go below one percent, though they have other ways to reduce the fines based on cooperation.” Qualcomm is no stranger to substantial fines. In 2009, South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission fined the company 273 billion won ($252 million), the agency’s biggest ever penalty against a single company, for abusing its dominant position in CDMA modem chips which were then used in handsets made by Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics. Falling afoul of Chinese regulators would be painful for Qualcomm, which saw revenues in China more than double over the last two years. Revenues, which include domestic sales as well as licenses for devices assembled in China and then exported, rose to $12.3 billion in 2013 from $4.7 billion in 2011. Shipments of 4G enabled smartphones, many of which use Qualcomm’s technology, are expected to increase by about a third to top half a billion units in Greater China in 2015, according to data firm Canalys, compared with the 385 million units shipped in 2013. Qualcomm charges handset manufacturers differing royalty rates, which usually range from 1 to 6 percent of the wholesale price of a handset. Some experts suggest the NDRC’s scrutiny of IT providers stems from its desire to lower domestic costs as China rolls out its 4G mobile networks. Last year, the NDRC started an investigation of U.S. firm InterDigital Inc to assess antitrust complaints by Huawei Technologies Co related to technologies for wireless devices and networks. Delaware-based InterDigital has ongoing legal proceedings with Huawei in the United States, Europe and China. “They (NDRC) have particular markets in mind and they have particular views of what the prices should be in the market,” said New York-based lawyer Chin.

268,QCOM,UPDATE 2-Smartphone slowdown hits ARM's royalties in fourth quarter,"* Q4 royalties revenue $130.4 mln vs forecasts of $137.9 mln * Company sees royalties up about 19 pct in 2014 * Licensing beat expectations * Shares fall sharply By Paul Sandle LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - British chip designer ARM Holdings  said a slowdown in demand for Apple and Samsung  smartphones was behind a smaller than expected rise in fourth-quarter royalty revenues. ARM, whose technology is in nearly every smartphone, reported processor royalties of $130.4 million, up 7 percent, but short of analyst forecasts of $137.9 million. The top-end smartphone market has showed signs of reaching saturation, with Apple and Samsung, both ARM customers, last month reporting lower than expected sales of the iPhone 5S and Galaxy S4 phones in the holiday season. But the Cambridge-based company also said there was strong demand for licensing its technology across a whole range of applications from servers to dishwashers, exercise machines and wearable technology such as smart watches. ARM said its royalties continued to grow faster than the broader semiconductor market, but the degree of outperformance was impacted by slower sales of chips for high-end smartphones in the second half of the year. Chief Financial Officer Tim Score said the smartphones, which provide just under half of ARM’s royalty revenue, were “slowing down” at the very high end, but cheaper devices were selling well. “Overall royalties in 2014 we expect to grow at a similar rate to the last three years, broadly 19-20 percent,” he said. Royalties make up just over half of ARM’s revenues, with licenses accounting for slightly less than half. ARM shares fell to a five-month low after the results, and were down 3.1 percent at 902.5 pence at 1034 GMT. Score said ARM continued to see strong demand for the licensing of its energy-efficient technology for new uses in networking, servers and wearable devices. Processing licensing revenue rose 26 percent to $107.2 million in the fourth quarter, beating market consensus expectations of $94.7 million. “We continue to benefit from the growth of digital electronics ... from smart consumer electronics such as phones, tablets and TVs, to energy efficient enterprise networking and serves to more embedded computing into things like smart sensors and wearable technology,” he said. Analyst Julian Yates at Investec said: “Royalties were slightly below expectations due to slower high end smartphone sales.” He said he expected to trim royalty estimates by about 3 percent, having forecast 22 percent year-on-year growth. But the stronger licensing outlook would compensate, he said, resulting in no change to his headline numbers, which were about 5 percent below consensus. He sees 2014 pretax profit of 419.8 million pounds. ARM licenses its designs to partners, such as Qualcomm Inc  and Samsung and receives a small royalty on every chip shipped. Some 10 billion ARM-based chips were shipped in 2013, Score said. The chips in the latest smartphones, such as the first 64-bit processors in the iPhone 5S, carry higher royalty rates than those in simpler phones. Score said, however, mid and low-tier smartphones, where most of the growth will come in the next five years, were  incorporating more and more ARM technology, enabling it to stick to its medium-term forecast of 15-25 percent per year growth in smartphone royalties over the next five years. Overall, ARM posted a 19 percent rise in pretax profit to 95.5 million pounds ($156 million) on revenue up 15 percent at 189.1 million pounds, broadly in line with expectations. The company said it expected to meet analyst forecasts for 2014 revenue, which Score said stood at $1.28 billion.",2042014,http://www.reuters.com/article/arm-results/update-2-smartphone-slowdown-hits-arms-royalties-in-fourth-quarter-idUSL5N0L90VZ20140204
269,QCOM,UPDATE 1-Chipmaker Wolfson Micro misses out on early 4G demand,"By Paul Sandle LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - British microchip maker Wolfson Microelectronics swung to an underlying loss in the final quarter of 2013 after it struggled against Qualcomm’s  dominance in 4G mobile phone technology. The Edinburgh-based company that specialises in audio technology is a supplier for the 3G version of Samsung’s  Galaxy S4 smartphone but its chips were not in the 4G model of the top-selling handset. Chief Executive Mike Hickey said the company paid the price for a “faster than anticipated transition from 3G to 4G smartphones that benefited a competitor”. He acknowledged that Qualcomm is the dominant provider of processing technology for first-generation 4G phones, but expects Wolfson to catch up as more platforms compatible with its chip technology enter the market. “There are a lot of other silicon providers, such as Samsung LSI, Broadcom, Intel and Nvidia, all bringing to market alternative LTE (4G) platforms, and we are the natural choice for our customers with those platforms,” Hickey said. Wolfson posted an underlying operating loss of $4.5 million for the final quarter of 2013, against a profit of $1.5 million for the same period a year earlier, on revenue that dipped to $42 million from $56.1 million. Hickey said he expects the company to resume its growth trajectory in the second half of 2014 as customers, including Chinese smartphone makers, launch new products using Wolfson’s technology and as new LTE platforms come to market. Shares in Wolfson fell to a two-year low of 109 pence after the results, which analysts said were slightly worse than expected. They were trading down 9 percent at 120 pence by 1147 GMT. The outlook for first-quarter revenue of between $28 million and $36 million was also below consensus, which stood at $36.8 million, Citi analysts said.",2052014,http://www.reuters.com/article/wolfson/update-1-chipmaker-wolfson-micro-misses-out-on-early-4g-demand-idUSL5N0LA15Q20140205
270,QCOM,Analysis: Taiwan's MediaTek sets up backyard brawl with Qualcomm,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc, the world leader in smartphone microchips, may want to shore up its defensive tactics. Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc, the leading chip supplier for Chinese smartphones, is barreling into the U.S. market with a new major global branding campaign and setting up shop in San Diego, California, home to Qualcomm. This year, MediaTek plans to hire about 150 engineers, business development and marketing staff in the United States, adding to a 300-strong U.S. workforce, said Kristin Taylor, MediaTek’s vice president of U.S. corporate marketing. Outside the United States, the company plans to add 1,000 employees in 2014, increasing its ranks by around 10 percent. “We really feel that it’s a strategic area,” she said of San Diego’s Sorrento Valley, where MediaTek plans to open its new office in the next few months. It is home to many technology companies clustered around Qualcomm, one of the city’s largest employers. “A lot of our technology partners sit in that area and we want to be able to serve them,” said Taylor, a former Qualcomm veteran who joined MediaTek last year. MediaTek is relatively unknown outside Asia, where it has grown in the past decade to become the dominant supplier of low-cost cellphone chips, instrumental in helping companies such as China’s Xiaomi and South Korea’s LG Electronics Inc produce handsets that sell for less than $100 each. MediaTek plans this month to launch a rebranding campaign highlighting its expansion beyond China and into the United States and other developed markets led by Qualcomm. “We need to redefine that we really are at this point serving the entire globe and not just small pockets of the world,” Taylor said. She declined to give more details ahead of its launch. Lacking relationships with U.S. phone carriers, MediaTek is unlikely to challenge Qualcomm’s command of the high-end phone market soon, analysts said. In the mid- and low-tier categories, the Taiwanese company’s ability to produce chips very cheaply is giving it an edge over other U.S. players like Broadcom Corp, Nvidia Corp and even Intel Corp, which are all trying to compete with Qualcomm. MediaTek, whose stock market value of $18 billion surpasses Broadcom and Nvidia, far outsells Qualcomm in handsets aimed at Chinese consumers but it supplies processors for less than 3 percent of smartphones sold in the United States, according to Strategy Analytics analyst Sravan Kundojjala. MediaTek believes its future chips will help manufactures make cheap phones that can compete in quality against more expensive devices made with Qualcomm’s components. “The opportunity lies in picking up one of the fringe (manufacturers), giving them an excellent platform, great performance and a good price,” said Evercore analyst Patrick Wang. “Get a couple of those who get traction at a carrier in the U.S. and suddenly you see MediaTek’s export share increase a lot.” Founded in 1997, MediaTek got its start designing chips for digital televisions and optical devices like DVD players, before turning its attention to cellphones. Last year, it sold over 200 million smartphone chips in Asia and became the world’s 14th largest semiconductor company, according to research firm IHS. MediaTek’s expansion into the U.S. market comes as it faces more competition in China, where Qualcomm as well as up-and-coming rivals like Shanghai-based chipmaker Spreadtrum are replicating its low-cost model. Analysts on average expect MediaTek’s revenue growth to slow to 30 percent in 2014, from 36 percent in 2013. While that far outpaces Qualcomm’s forecast 8 percent revenue growth, JPMorgan has warned that MediaTek could be hurt by the slower rollout of next-generation wireless products in China. With a strategy that centers on offering manufacturers turnkey blueprints for quickly making inexpensive phones, MediaTek’s sights are set on mid-range smarpthones from the likes of Lenovo or Huawei, rather than premium devices from Apple Inc or Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Some analysts expect mid-range phones to gain popularity in the U.S. market, where a price war between carriers is expected to intensify this year. MediaTek’s move into mid-priced devices in China and around the world, along with efficient cost controls, may push its 2013 operating margin of 18 percent up another 4 percentage points over the next two years, said Evercore’s Wang. Like competitors, MediaTek is rushing to roll out wireless chips featuring Long-Term Evolution, an advanced technology for faster data transfer. LTE has become standard in U.S. phones and it is slowly being introduced in other parts of the world. So far, that technology is dominated by Qualcomm as rivals have run into delays launching their own LTE chips due to the technology’s complexity. That has left handset manufacturers craving an alternative. “Qualcomm owns 90-plus percent of the LTE modem market. That’s not a comfortable place for many of these OEMs (original equipment manufacturers),” said IDC analyst Les Santiago. “That alone will create an opportunity for a second-place LTE player. The issue is - who will that be?” For its part, Qualcomm said rivals have underestimated the challenge of making LTE chips that work well on different carriers’ networks. The company has made four generations of LTE products, a much longer track record than MediaTek and others. “We’ll see what happens when the products show up,” Qualcomm Senior Marketing Director Peter Carson said of rivals’ plans for LTE. “We know the industry continues to underestimate the increasing complexity of the LTE roadmap. We believe we have a performance advantage.” ",2072014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mobile-us-mediatek/analysis-taiwans-mediatek-sets-up-backyard-brawl-with-qualcomm-idUSBREA161RL20140207
271,QCOM,"China accuses Qualcomm of overcharging, abusing dominance","BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s anti-monopoly regulator on Wednesday said Qualcomm Inc. was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position, allegations which could see the U.S. chip giant hit with record fines of more than $1 billion. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) also said it was in talks with another U.S. technology firm, InterDigital Inc, about a possible settlement to a separate anti-monopoly probe as the regulator focuses on the rapidly evolving information technology market. Foreign firms from drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline to Apple Inc are facing tougher scrutiny in the world’s second-biggest economy as China targets key industries to protect consumers from bloated prices and second-rate products. In its first public statements about the Qualcomm investigation, the watchdog said it began making enquiries after receiving complaints that the San Diego-based company was charging higher prices in China than it does in other countries. “We received reports from relevant associations and companies that Qualcomm abuses its dominant position in the market and charges discriminatory fees,” Xu Kunlin, who heads the NDRC’s anti-monopoly and price supervision bureau, told a press conference in Beijing. The NDRC dual investigations are part of a focus on information technology providers, especially companies that license patent technology for mobile devices and networks. Industry experts say the NDRC, which is also the government’s main economic planning body, is trying to lower domestic costs as China rolls out its faster 4G mobile networks this year. Earlier this month, the China Mobile Communications Industry Association said it had filed a complaint against Qualcomm for overcharging for use of its patents. Under the anti-monopoly law, the NDRC can impose fines of between 1 and 10 percent of a company’s revenues for the previous year. Qualcomm earned $12.3 billion in China for its fiscal year ended September 29, or nearly half of its global sales. The NDRC said it conducted raids at Qualcomm’s Beijing headquarters and at its Shanghai offices in November. Officials subsequently met William Bold, Qualcomm’s senior vice president for government affairs, and Fabian Gonell, vice president and counsel for Qualcomm’s technology licensing, in December, the official Xinhua news agency reported. Qualcomm spokeswoman Christine Trimble said the company was cooperating with the investigation. “We haven’t seen the transcript of today’s press conference but we intend to continue cooperating fully with the NDRC,” she said. “The NDRC has advised us the investigation is confidential.” Any settlement with InterDigital or Qualcomm is likely to include commitments to lower patent licensing fees for Chinese customers, analysts say, along with a fine. On InterDigital, senior NDRC official Lu Yanchun said the company had to “make promises on what steps it will take in light of problems we’ve raised” about its licensing content. InterDigital, which develops patent technologies for wireless devices and networks, had been “very cooperative” and had “taken some positive steps,” Lu said. Executives from the Delaware-based company met with NDRC officials on January 3 to discuss ways to resolve the investigation, according to a stock exchange filing. InterDigital also apologized for “misunderstanding Chinese laws” in a December statement, in which the company said its executives feared arrest if they were to travel to Beijing. The NDRC, which is ramping its use of price-gouging and anti-monopoly oversight, has launched a number of investigations into Chinese and foreign companies over the past year.

274,QCOM,China's state planning body grows more assertive as revamp looms,"BEIJING, March 3 (Reuters) - China will present proposals to revamp its behemoth economic planning agency at an annual session of parliament this week, sources said, but the organisation’s role as an antitrust regulator could eventually be enhanced. Chinese and foreign companies, including U.S. technology firms Qualcomm Inc. and InterDigital Inc., have fallen afoul of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in recent months as its anti-monopoly arm has become more assertive. The mammoth agency, which has several thousand employees and has sweeping powers to decide on investment, prices and other issues in the world’s second-biggest economy, is striving to retain as much power as possible as it undergoes restructuring. The crackdown on price-fixing and monopolistic practices should become more pronounced as the NDRC has said it is ramping up staffing in its antitrust division. Academics and senior officials have forecast a streamlining of the NDRC since President Xi Jinping vowed to make the economy more responsive to market forces and shift to consumer-focused investment from a state-led model. Two sources close to senior leaders said proposals have been readied to restructure the NDRC and these will be discussed at the National People’s Congress annual session beginning on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if any decisions would be taken. But the NDRC’s role as one of three national antitrust regulators - along with the Commerce Ministry and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce - is set in the country’s five-year-old Anti-Monopoly Law that is unlikely to be cut back or revised soon. “The NDRC is getting ready for a new role. This corresponds with the flurry of antitrust actions,” said a Beijing-based foreign diplomat who asked not to be named. Xu Kunlin, the head of the NDRC’s price supervision and anti-monopoly bureau, has hinted at more unified antitrust powers, underlining speculation that the agency is seeking for primacy among the three regulators. “Having a relatively independent, authoritative or strong and unified antitrust body is a trend. Many antitrust structures around the world are under one roof,” Xu said last month. Xu’s comments could be part of the NDRC’s attempt to focus on the antitrust role, and stay relevant as its broader powers are slashed, said Yee Wah Chin, a New York-based antitrust expert at law firm Ingram, Yuzek, Gainen, Carroll and Bertolotti. “The NDRC will continue to expand its AML (anti-monopoly law) enforcement scope by the investigations it conducts, and it is entirely possible that some formal restructuring of AML enforcement will be made after several more years,” Chin said. Last year, the NDRC slapped Chinese and foreign companies with investigations and fines after high-profile pricing probes. In August, the regulator fined six infant formula manufacturers, including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co, Danone  and Fonterra, a record $110 million after a probe into price fixing and anti-competitive practices. The agency confirmed last month it had opened anti-monopoly investigations into Qualcomm and InterDigital, saying it had received complaints that the companies charged discriminatory high prices in China. Adam Dunnett, secretary general of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said he expects the pricing investigations to maintain their momentum in the medium term. “The European Chamber has encouraged its members to review their own practices and closely monitor further developments,” he said, adding that the anti-monopoly law would play an important role in a more market-oriented China if evenly enforced. At the moment, the NDRC sets policy for strategic industries, approves big investments and has the authority to influence prices for everything from liquor to gasoline. Its powers are so sweeping that it is often called the mini cabinet. Beijing has promised to reduce its involvement in matters like the approval of new industrial projects, allowing it instead to focus on improving rules and regulations. According to one proposal, the agency would be renamed the National Development, Reform and Planning Commission and fold in functions of other departments, including the Development Research Centre, a cabinet think-tank. “Eventually, the NDRC will just be a think-tank. Its main functions will be to formulate (policies) and conduct research on macro (economic) planning,” one source with ties to the leadership said on condition of anonymity. “The views of various ministries and provincial governments have been solicited,” a second source said. The party announced after a conclave last November that a high-powered committee would be created to oversee the gamut of China’s reforms, including coordination between ministries. President Xi heads the group which experts have said could signal changes to the NDRC’s discretionary powers. “I do expect the NDRC’s wings to get clipped,” said Scott Kennedy, director of the Research Centre for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University. “The creation of the leading group on economic reform is already a big signal that the NDRC’s powers will be cut,” he said. The NDRC did not respond to Reuters questions sent by fax. However, a rapid transition is unlikely within such a huge bureaucracy. “The government has been cutting red tape but we cannot see any signs of downsizing,” an NDRC researcher told Reuters on condition of anonymity, noting that there would be stiff federal-level employees. “The NDRC will still approve investment plans involving state spending. It will still be responsible for coordinating economic policies,” the researcher said.",3022014,http://www.reuters.com/article/china-parliament-ndrc/chinas-state-planning-body-grows-more-assertive-as-revamp-looms-idUSL3N0LJ32D20140302
275,QCOM,Qualcomm's new CEO says smartphone innovation still strong,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Steve Mollenkopf, the new chief executive of Qualcomm, said on Tuesday that the mobile chipmaker is developing technologies that will drive continued demand for smartphones even as others worry that the smartphone market’s best days are behind it. Mollenkopf, 45, who was previously chief operating officer, officially took over as chief executive officer at the company’s annual shareholders meeting on Tuesday. He was named in December to replace Paul Jacobs, the son of a Qualcomm co-founder. “A lot of people talk about the fact that everyone has a smartphone. That’s true to some degree in some parts of the world, but the world is a big place and there are a lot more smartphones coming,” Mollenkopf told the shareholders meeting. Qualcomm’s shares have underperformed the S&P; 500 for the past 12 months as smartphone demand shifts from the United States and other developed countries, where top-tier phones like the iPhone have become ubiquitous, to China, where consumers tend to buy less expensive devices with lower-end displays and other features. Mollenkopf pointed to wireless connectivity, cameras, sensors and audio as key smartphone technologies Qualcomm is improving and which he said will help drive demand. “We’re working on technologies that emulate how the brain processes information. Ultimately, I think you get to the point where the phone becomes an extension of all of your senses,” Mollenkopf said. After increasing 39 percent last year, smartphone shipments are expected to expand by 19 percent in 2014, and growth is expected to continue to slow, falling to just 6 percent in 2018, according to market research firm IDC. China’s local market is becoming increasingly important for Qualcomm as China Mobile, the world’s largest wireless carrier, rolls out an advanced network this year based on technology the U.S. chipmaker effectively dominates. But Mollenkopf, who joined Qualcomm in 1994 as an engineer and was named chief operating officer in 2011, also faces an antitrust investigation in China that may affect future licensing revenue from smartphones made there. China’s country’s competition regulator said in February it suspected Qualcomm of overcharging and abusing its market position. While most of Qualcomm’s revenue comes from chips that allow phones to communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its CDMA cellphone technology - a component in new fourth-generation mobile phones. Also on Tuesday, Qualcomm raised its dividend by 20 percent and upped its share repurchase authorization by $5 billion to $7.8 billion. Shares of Qualcomm rose 3.74 percent to $76.38 following after the company announced its dividend increase.

280,QCOM,"TCL's Li doubles down on global markets, nudges Qualcomm on fees","BEIJING, March 10 (Reuters) - TCL Corp expects group revenues to surpass 100 billion yuan ($16.32 billion) this year for the first time as the Chinese electronics giant increasingly turns to Europe, Latin America and the United States to sell more smartphones and televisions. TCL expects to see sustained revenue growth at its handset company, now the world’s fifth-biggest, while profits at its television unit are expected rebound, company chief executive Thomson Li Dongheng told Reuters. Li also called on Qualcomm Inc., the U.S. chipset maker, to lower the fees it charges Chinese companies. TCL Multimedia Technology Holdings, TCL’s Hong Kong-listed television unit, posted losses of HK$119 million ($15.33 million)last year even as revenue increased 9.6 percent to HK$39.5 billion, as overstocking of raw materials and supplier mishaps raised sales costs. “We have to be more competitive and speed up the transformation of the television business,” Li said in an interview on the sidelines of China’s annual parliamentary session in Beijing. Li said revenue for the TV set business should increase about 10 percent this year. TCL is targeting international markets, which now account for 42 percent of total sales, as cheaper technology makes Chinese-made electronic goods affordable in both emerging and developed markets. The percentage of global sales is expected to increase, Li said. TCL reported group revenue last year reached 85.32 billion yuan, an increase of 22.9 percent, while net profit jumped to 2.88 billion yuan. TCL Communication Technology Holdings, the group’s Hong Kong-listed handset maker, makes more than 90 percent of its revenue offshore, primarily in the Americas and Europe. Last year, TCL purchased the rights to rename Grauman’s Chinese Theater, along Hollywood’s Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, the TCL Chinese Theatre.. Handset sales in 2013 reached 55.2 million units, including 17.6 million smartphones, and have been a main driver for the company since last July. TCL Communications, which sells under the Alcatel brand overseas, also competes against Huawei Technologies Co, ZTE Corp and Lenovo Group . TCL’s mobile phone sales should increase by 50 percent this year, Li said. Profitability remains an issue, particularly as increased competition forces handset makers to lower prices. “We remain concerned about how the company can cope with mounting smartphone margin pressure in both emerging and matured markets,” wrote Andrew Hsu, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd in a research note last month. “Chinese companies are becoming more competitive. There are five Chinese brands in the world’s top ten, but our profitability is poor compared with Samsung or Apple,” Li said. “Chinese firms do better against brands like LG, Nokia and Motorola.” The TCL chief also said he supported efforts by China’s anti-monopoly regulator to help lower the license fees on chipsets paid to Qualcomm Inc. “Qualcomm’s patent fees, frankly speaking, are relatively high,” said Li. “Our profits last year were only a little more than 1 percent. It’s clear this standard isn’t reasonable.” TCL on average paid royalty fees amounting to 5 percent of sales for chipsets used in its 3G and 4G handsets. China’s National Development and Reform Commission, which in November started investigating Qualcomm’s rates, said in February that the San Diego-based firm was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position. Li said a more suitable level for all mobile royalties would be 3 percent.

282,QCOM,Qualcomm talks up future top-tier smartphone chip,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Qualcomm gave details on Monday about a future high-end smartphone chip, including faster download speeds as well as 64-bit technology, which is quickly becoming standard. Due to appear in smartphones in 2015, the Snapdragon 810 is Qualcomm’s latest bid to use its edge in wireless technology to maintain its marketshare lead in semiconductors for mobile devices. The 810 chip includes new, faster WiFi features as well as a 4G modem that Qualcomm says downloads data at twice the speed of chips made with its previous technology. The chip also allows for video recording and playback at “4K” ultra-high resolution. Following Apple’s launch last year of its first iPhone made with a 64-bit processor, Qualcomm and other chipmakers have been rushing to roll out their own 64-bit technology, which reduces the gap between low-power mobile processors and punchier chips used in laptops, desktop PCs and servers. Qualcomm is announcing its newest chip before the preceding chip in its high-end lineup, the 805, has even begun to appear in smartphones. The 805 is due to appear in smartphones around mid-2014. Current smartphones, including Apple’s, do not have enough memory to give 64-bit processors an advantage over more widely used 32-bit chips, but future phones will be made with enough memory to give the 64-bit processors a performance boost. Before 64-bit features can be taken advantage of in phones, the software and operating systems they rely on will also have to be overhauled, a major undertaking for the industry. Qualcomm in December announced its first 64-bit chip, part of its low-end lineup and aimed for use this year in inexpensive smartphones in the fast-growing Chinese market. “We’re basically saying it’s difficult to call exactly when 64-bit operating systems and applications will become mainstream, but by integrating them now we’re future-proofing all of our platforms going forward for the benefit of our (customers),” Executive Vice President Murthy Renduchintala told Reuters. Qualcomm dominates the market for advanced 4G wireless technology and its Snapdragon chips are widely used in smartphones made by Samsung Electronics, Motorola, HTC and other manufacturers. But the San Diego, California chipmaker faces a smartphone market that is beginning to grow less quickly. Smartphone demand is shifting from the United States and other developed countries, where top-tier phones like the iPhone have become ubiquitous, to China, where consumers tend to buy less expensive devices with lower-end displays and other features. After increasing 39 percent last year, smartphone shipments are expected to expand by 19 percent in 2014, and growth is expected to continue to slow, falling to just 6 percent in 2018, according to market research firm IDC. Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf has told investors who are worried about a less vigorous smartphone market that Qualcomm’s future chip innovations will drive fresh demand for smartphones.

283,QCOM,Qualcomm talks up future top-tier smartphone chip,"SAN FRANCISCO, April 7 (Reuters) - Qualcomm gave details on Monday about a future high-end smartphone chip, including faster download speeds as well as 64-bit technology, which is quickly becoming standard. Due to appear in smartphones in 2015, the Snapdragon 810 is Qualcomm’s latest bid to use its edge in wireless technology to maintain its marketshare lead in semiconductors for mobile devices. The 810 chip includes new, faster WiFi features as well as a 4G modem that Qualcomm says downloads data at twice the speed of chips made with its previous technology. The chip also allows for video recording and playback at “4K”  ultra-high resolution.

Pantech, South Korea’s No.3 smartphone maker, has been under a debt-restructuring programme after suffering six consecutive quarters of losses due to fierce competition. “Micromax told Pantech that it was interested in a stake in the company,” one of the sources said, declining to elaborate on the size of a potential deal and other details. Nine creditor banks own a combined 37 percent of Pantech, while Qualcomm Inc has a 12 percent stake and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd holds 10 percent. “Micromax is among those who are interested in Pantech,” another source said. The two sources declined to be identified because of the confidentiality of the sales process. High-end smartphone maker Pantech has struggled against competition from giant rivals Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics Inc in South Korea, where nearly 70 percent of mobile users have smartphones. Pantech also sells phones in such markets as the United States and Japan. Micromax has brought smartphones to the masses in India’s  price-sensitive market where basic handsets still dominate, with heavy advertising and phones based on Google Inc’s  Android software starting at $50 - almost half the price of a comparable Samsung model. Now the unlisted company backed by private equity firms TA Associates and Sequoia Capital is trying to push into pricier segments dominated by global brands and break into overseas markets.

288,QCOM,"UPDATE 3-Qualcomm's quarterly revenue growth dwindles, shares fall","(Adds detail on results and investigation, analyst comment) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, April 23 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Wednesday posted its smallest quarterly revenue increase since 2010 as it wrestles with a smartphone market that is losing steam and shifting to China, sending its shares lower. With expansion in the smartphone industry moving away from wealthy markets such as the United States and toward China and other developing countries, where consumers favor less expensive devices, Qualcomm’s once-impressive revenue growth is tapering off and it is focusing on costs to preserve its profitability. The chipmaker reported fiscal second-quarter revenue of $6.37 billion, up 4 percent from the year-ago period. Analysts on average had expected $6.479 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That was the smallest year-over-year percentage increase since the June quarter of 2010 when revenue shrank by 2 percent. It was far lower than the quarterly growth rates of over 20 percent that Qualcomm investors until recently have been accustomed to. Less growth than expected in recent months in China, where China Mobile is preparing to launch a new, faster network with 4G, or LTE, technology, hurt Qualcomm’s results in the quarter, Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf told Reuters. “We think that what’s happening there is that is in anticipation of the launch of LTE,” Mollenkopf said. He said he expects improvements later in fiscal 2014 as China Mobile, the world’s largest cellphone carrier, rolls out its new 4G network. “The hope is the China lift will drive their recovery,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “But anytime you have semiconductor companies looking for a back-half recovery it makes people nervous.” Also on Wednesday, Qualcomm said it received a notice from the SEC advising the company of a preliminary determination recommending enforcement action in connection with a previously disclosed China-related bribery investigation. The company denied wrongdoing and said it was cooperating with the investigation. Qualcomm is also being investigated by China’s anti-monopoly regulator, which says it suspects the U.S. company of overcharging and abusing its market position, allegations which could lead to fines of more than $1 billion. China and other developing countries are a major opportunity for the San Diego company as consumers upgrade from feature phones to smartphones and as China Mobile rolls out its 4G network with technology that Qualcomm dominates. But China also presents challenges for Qualcomm as its competes with local rivals like MediaTek to sell chips used in smartphones made by Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and Xiaomi, which sell for much less than phones popular in the United States. While the majority of Qualcomm’s revenue comes from selling so-called baseband chips that enable phones to communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its widespread CDMA cellphone technology. Average prices for cellphones in the December quarter, used to calculate licensing revenue for Qualcomm in the March quarter, were between $221 and $227, the company said. That was more than the $219 to $225 range that Qualcomm estimated for the September quarter in its previous earnings statement. Founded in 1985, Qualcomm has become the top chip supplier for smartphones, and its stock value has surpassed that of Intel Corp. Intel is still the world’s largest chipmaker by revenue but it has struggled to move beyond personal computers and gain a foothold in mobile. Global smartphone shipments are likely to grow 19 percent this year, far less than the 39 percent increase in 2013, according to IDC. Qualcomm had second-quarter net income of $1.96 billion, up 5 percent. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.14. Its non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.31, above its previous forecast of between $1.15 and $1.25. Analysts on average expected $1.22. Qualcomm said it now expects full-year non-GAAP earnings per share between $5.05 and $5.25. It had previously forecast 2014 EPS between $5.00 and $5.20. It said revenue in the fiscal third quarter, which ends in June, would be between $6.2 billion and $6.8 billion. Analysts on average expected third-quarter revenue of $6.592 billion. Qualcomm shares were down 4.98 percent in extended trading after closing up 0.12 percent at $80.71 on Nasdaq.

290,QCOM,Qualcomm faces China bribery allegations from U.S. regulator,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm said on Wednesday it could face a civil action from U.S. authorities over alleged bribery of officials associated with state-owned companies in China. With smartphone sales tapering off in the United States, China is a major market for Qualcomm, but doing business there has included disagreements over royalties and an antitrust investigation. In its fiscal second-quarter report, Qualcomm said it has received a notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Los Angeles office advising it of a preliminary determination to recommend an enforcement action against the company for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Qualcomm said the civil action could seek remedies including “disgorgement of profits, the retention of an independent compliance monitor to review the company’s FCPA policies and procedures, an injunction, civil monetary penalties and prejudgment interest.” Qualcomm said it first learned of and disclosed the SEC investigation in 2012. In its own investigation, Qualcomm said it found instances in which “special hiring consideration, gifts or other benefits were provided to several individuals associated with Chinese state-owned companies or agencies.” The chipmaker believes the total value of the benefits was less than $250,000. Qualcomm said it received a from the SEC’s Los Angeles office on March 13 advising it of the preliminary determination. On April 4, the San Diego company submitted an explanation of why it believes it has not violated the FCPA. Earlier this month, Hewlett-Packard said it would pay $108 million to settle potential violations of the FCPA in Russia, Poland and other countries. They include allegations that an HP executive paid bribes worth over $500,000 in exchange for help winning contracts to supply computer equipment to Polish police headquarters. China’s anti-monopoly regulator is also investigating Qualcomm, which it suspects of overcharging and abusing its market position. Those allegations could lead to fines of more than $1 billion. On a quarterly conference call with analysts on Wednesday, Qualcomm executives repeatedly denied the company had broken the law but declined to provide more details on the SEC allegations. Scrutiny of Qualcomm’s practices in China come at a key moment in its transformation from a smartphone manufacturing hub to a major consumer market in its own right. China Mobile, the world’s largest cellphone carrier, is set to roll out a new network this year using 4G technology that Qualcomm dominates. “China is an important part of their story. It’s where all their unit growth is coming from,” said FBR analyst Chris Rolland. “I think the (bribery investigation) will have limited financial impact by the time it’s all said and done, but it certainly isn’t good.” (Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Prudence Crowther) ",4242014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-corruption/qualcomm-faces-china-bribery-allegations-from-u-s-regulator-idUSBREA3N00M20140424

292,QCOM,"STMicro posts lower first-quarter revenue, smaller loss","SAN FRANCISCO, April 28 (Reuters) - STMicroelectronics  posted lower first-quarter revenue and a loss that narrowed after the European chipmaker exited its mobile joint venture with ST-Ericsson. Franco-Italian STMicro, whose chips are used in cars, computers and mobile phones, posted first-quarter revenue of $1.825 billion, down from $2.009 billion in the year-ago quarter. Six analysts polled by Reuters on average had expected first-quarter revenue of $1.836 billion. Its net loss in the first quarter shrank to $24 million from $171 million in the same quarter the year before. Its non-GAAP loss per share was 1 cent. Last year, STMicro and telecom network gear maker Ericsson ended their money-losing joint venture to make chips for mobile phones. Since then, STMicro has refocused on product lines for automobiles, video game consoles, and high-end smartphones, but that move has yet to pay off in terms of higher profits. Excluding legacy ST-Ericsson products, the chipmaker’s revenue grew 1 percent in the quarter. The company said its total revenue in the second quarter would rise 2 percent compared to the first quarter. STMicro is the eighth-largest semiconductor maker by global sales but it has lost ground to rivals like Qualcomm, Intel and Samsung in recent years because of its higher cost base and difficulties suffered by Nokia, once its largest customer.

The indictment alleges the men learned that Qualcomm was about to acquire Atheros Communications Inc, then a publicly traded technology company headquartered in California. Cohen and Herman, according to the indictment, placed more than $500,000 in trades on various Atheros securities issued one day before Qualcomm officially announced the acquisition. After the news became public, Cohen and Herman sold the securities, which earned them a total profit of nearly $230,000, according to the indictment. Cohen, who was arrested on Saturday, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment on Monday in Los Angeles federal court, according to government prosecutors. Herman remains at large.

Shares of ParkerVision, which designs wireless chips, plunged as much as 76 percent on Monday. In a decision dated June 20, U.S. District Judge Roy Dalton in Jacksonville, Florida, said expert testimony offered by a key ParkerVision witness provided “an insufficient evidentiary basis” for a finding of patent infringement. He also said Qualcomm deserves a new trial if an appeals court disagrees. “While the court is loath to overturn the jury’s verdict, on this record, it is the court’s only choice,” Dalton wrote. He also rejected Qualcomm’s request to rule the patents invalid. ParkerVision Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Parker said in a statement that he was “obviously disappointed” by the outcome, and that the Jacksonville-based company would appeal. “We are very pleased,” Alex Rogers, head of litigation at San Diego-based Qualcomm, said in a statement. “Qualcomm simply does not use the techniques claimed in ParkerVision’s patents.” In court papers, ParkerVision had charged that Qualcomm in 2006 began infringing its patents for radio signal converion technology, incorporating it in products sold for use in mobile devices such as smartphones. ParkerVision claimed it had sought without success to license the technology to Qualcomm in the late 1990s, only to learn more than a decade later that the rival chipmaker had begun using it. The $173 million award had been seen as a disappointment for ParkerVision, which had sought more than twice as much. Jurors also rejected ParkerVision’s argument that Qualcomm’s alleged infringement was willful, which could have resulted in triple damages. ParkerVision also has a separate lawsuit against Qualcomm and HTC Corp over other patents that relate to radio frequency transmitters. In afternoon trading on the Nasdaq, ParkerVision shares were down $2.92, or 58.3 percent, at $2.09, after earlier falling to $1.21. Qualcomm was down 6 cents at $79.80.

The $173 million award had been seen as a disappointment for ParkerVision, which had sought more than twice as much. Jurors also rejected ParkerVision’s argument that Qualcomm’s alleged infringement was willful, which could have resulted in triple damages. ParkerVision also has a separate lawsuit against Qualcomm and HTC Corp over other patents that relate to radio frequency transmitters. In morning trading on the Nasdaq, ParkerVision shares were down 64.9 percent at $1.77 after falling to $1.21. Qualcomm dipped 0.5 percent to $79.43. The case is ParkerVision Inc v Qualcomm Inc, U.S. District Court, Middle District of Florida, No. 11-00719.

302,QCOM,RPT--Microsoft sides with Qualcomm in showdown over connected home,"(Repeats article originally sent on July 1 with no changes to text.) By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO, July 1 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp  has joined Qualcomm Inc and other technology companies in a bid to establish standard ways for household devices like light bulbs and thermostats to talk to each other. The Qualcomm-backed AllSeen Alliance is among a growing number of efforts for companies working alone or in groups to promote protocols for how smart devices should work together in a trend increasingly referred to as the Internet of Things. Microsoft on Tuesday joined 50 other members in the AllSeen Alliance, including major consumer electronics players Panasonic Corp, LG Electronics Inc  and Sharp Corp , the group said. But chipmakers that compete with Qualcomm plan to launch a rival standards consortium as early as next week, an industry source who was familiar with the plans but not authorized to discuss them, also told Reuters on Tuesday. Battle lines are being drawn as manufacturers roll out growing numbers of Internet-connected burglar alarms, televisions and baby monitors. But like the early days of video cassette recorders, many of the smart home products being launched are incompatible with each other. Qualcomm and other tech companies believe the quick establishment of standards across home-connected gadgets, cars and wearable computing devices will accelerate the introduction of new devices by manufacturers. Making it easy for software developers to design apps that let household devices work together in useful ways, like making living room LED light bulbs flash red when food is burning on the stove, may also stir more interest from consumers who have yet to become excited by smart products currently on offer, the companies hope. To that end, Qualcomm led the development of a connection standard called AllJoyn and made it free for other companies to use in their products. But, like the rivalry between Betamax and VHS video formats over three decades ago, Silicon Valley is far from agreement on what standards should rule. Apple Inc, known for strictly controlling how other companies’ products interact with its own, in June announced plans for HomeKit, which will integrate control of devices like garage door openers, lights and thermostats. Last week, Google said it partnered with Mercedes-Benz, Whirlpool Corp  and light bulb maker LIFX to integrate their products with Google’s Nest thermostats and smoke detectors. “All these things need a standard. Nobody wants to buy a TV and have to make sure their speakers are compliant,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “But we’re in an experimentation phase with the Internet of Things. It’s early days and nobody knows what it’s eventually going to look like.” Asked whether Intel Corp  would join Qualcomm’s alliance, an Intel spokeswoman said in an email, “There are multiple forums driving different approaches to solve the challenge of IoT connectivity.

304,QCOM,Qualcomm turns to China's SMIC for Snapdragon chip production,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Qualcomm, which makes mobile chips, said on Thursday that Chinese contract manufacturer SMIC would produce its Snapdragon processors. The agreement with SMIC suggests Qualcomm aims to shore up capacity for future demand but it could also improve Qualcomm’s relationship with the government in China, a key growth market where the U.S. chipmaker has been under antitrust scrutiny. Qualcomm said in a news release it is working in China with SMIC, or Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, on 28 nanometer manufacturing technology used to make its Snapdragon chips, which are used widely in smartphones. SMIC has previously made power management and other chips on behalf of Qualcomm but the Snapdragon agreement signifies a technological step up in the two companies’ relationship.  Qualcomm is a major customer of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, the world’s leading contract chip manufacturer. In 2012, a slower-than-expected launch of 28 nm production at TSMC affected the supply of chips to customers including Qualcomm and Nvidia.  “You’re going to have an iPhone launch, then holiday selling season. There could be a pretty substantial increase in wafers for back half (of 2014), said FBR analyst Chris Rolland.  SMIC is the world’s fifth largest contract chipmaker, according to market research firm IC Insights, and it trails TSMC in technology.  China’s anti-monopoly regulator has accused Qualcomm of overcharging and abusing its market position, and the chipmaker could face a fine more than $1 billion. Helping SMIC with 28 nm production will mean a boost to China’s semiconductor industry and could help SMIC offer similar services to customers beyond Qualcomm. The Chinese government has placed enormous emphasis on moving the world’s second-largest economy up the technology value chain in areas such as semiconductors. TSMC is now ramping up newer 20 nm manufacturing technology, allowing for increased power and efficiency by packing more transistors onto each chip.

306,QCOM,"Taiwan's TSMC shares fall on Apple, Qualcomm order loss reports","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) fell as much as 6 percent on Thursday after an analyst and Taiwanese media reported the likely loss of orders for next-generation chips from Apple Inc and Qualcomm Inc. The world’s largest contract chip manufacturer on Wednesday reported its highest quarterly profit since the end of 2006, and said it expected revenue to grow at least a record 20 percent this year. Behind the bullish outlook was likely increased demand from Apple which recently chose TSMC over Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to make the majority of chips for the successor to its iPhone 5 series of smartphones, industry insiders said. But both Apple and Qualcomm will likely buy a larger proportion of 14 nanometer smartphone chips from Samsung rather than TSMC beginning in the second half of 2015, KGI Securities analyst Michael Liu said in a note to clients. Liu did not detail the source of the information in the note, issued late on Wednesday following an investor conference held after TSMC reported second-quarter earnings. The Commercial Times on Thursday, citing market speculation, said Qualcomm has already started working with Samsung to develop the chips. The Economic Daily News said without citing sources that Qualcomm had placed orders with Samsung. The reports sent shares of TSMC down as much as 5.75 percent in Thursday trade compared with a 1 percent decline in the benchmark index. Yuanta Securities Analyst George Chang, who also attended the conference, said of Apple and Qualcomm on Thursday that “This is still just a lot of speculation.” “We haven’t even seen the iPhone 6 yet, so it’s too early to say anything about future products,” Chang said. During the conference, TSMC Chairman Morris Chang said the company’s market share in 16 nanometer chips - which perform similarly to 14 nanometer chips - will be smaller than “a major competitor” next year, and that TSMC will regain a leading share from 2016. The size of chips in the latest high-end smartphones is 28 nanometers, according to TSMC. On Thursday, spokespeople at TSMC in Taiwan and Apple in China could not be reached for comment. A Qualcomm representative in China said she had not seen the reports and so declined to comment. A Samsung representative in South Korea also said she had not seen the reports and declined to comment.

308,QCOM,Former Qualcomm executive pleads guilty to insider trading,"(Reuters) - A former president of Qualcomm Inc’s global business operations pleaded guilty on Monday to insider trading in shares of the mobile phone chipmaker and a company it bought in 2011, as well as to a related money laundering charge. Jing Wang, 51, entered his plea before U.S. District Judge William Hayes in San Diego over trades that resulted in about $250,000 of illegal gains, the U.S. Department of Justice said. Prosecutors said Wang used nonpublic information to trade in Qualcomm shares in 2010 before a surprise dividend increase and stock repurchase, and in 2011 before record results were announced. They said he also traded illegally in Atheros Communications Inc shares in 2010 hours after learning that Qualcomm had made a nonpublic offer to buy that company. Wang also pleaded guilty to laundering proceeds through a shell company based in the British Virgin Islands, in an effort to disguise ownership and avoid taxes, prosecutors said. “Jing Wang blatantly and repeatedly abused the trust placed in him by Qualcomm and the company’s shareholders,” U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said in a statement. Wang had been indicted in September along with his brother Bing Wang and broker Gary Yin, who worked at Bank of America Corp’s Merrill Lynch unit. Yin pleaded guilty in September to conspiring to help the brothers obstruct justice and launder money. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 15. An arrest warrant is outstanding for Bing Wang, who is believed to live in China. Thomas McNamara, a lawyer for Jing Wang, said his client “accepts full responsibility” for his actions. “He wants to express his sincere remorse to the community and, in particular, he apologizes to his many friends at Qualcomm,” McNamara added. Sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 17, another lawyer for Jing Wang said. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in September filed related civil charges against Jing Wang and Yin.

311,QCOM,China's Xiaomi hopes Mi 4 smartphone can take on Apple,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Xiaomi launched its flagship Mi 4 smartphone at a glitzy event in Beijing, where the Chinese budget handset maker’s chief executive sought to challenge larger U.S. rival Apple Inc. The Mi 4 comes as budget handset makers in China are competing more aggressively on price and generous features, with even high-end manufacturers feeling the pressure. South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Ltd said this month that its disappointing smartphone shipments were due to poor sales in China, which had 1.27 billion mobile subscribers in June. Dressed in a black T-shirt and blue jeans, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun took aim repeatedly at iPhone maker Apple during the presentation on Tuesday, comparing the design and manufacturing process of his new 4G handset to the U.S. firm’s more expensive offerings.  “Our product really is better than the iPhone,” said Lei.  “Our white version is also better than their white version,” he joked. “Even our white color is whiter!”  Apple, which was due to announce second-quarter earnings later on Tuesday, was not immediately available to comment. The forthright Jun spent nearly an hour on stage describing the Mi 4 phone’s construction - particularly its beveled metal rim whose similarity with Apple’s phones drew murmurs of “iPhone” from the journalists at the event. The Mi 4, which goes on sale July 29 for 1999 yuan ($320), has a 5 inch, 1080p screen and a Qualcomm Inc Snapdragon 801 2.5 Ghz processor. An equivalent iPhone 5s costs $650. Analyst Neil Shah at technology consultant Counterpoint said that while Xiaomi was gaining swiftly in emerging markets, it did not pose a real threat to Apple just yet. “Right now it’s more a big talk rather than real threat to Apple,” said Shah. “In emerging markets they are growing in leap and bounds, attracting buyers who aspire to Apple but they can’t afford to buy Apple.  “But if tomorrow Xiaomi raise their price to Apple levels, they won’t sell. They’re trying to build that brand equity by comparing themselves to Apple.” Founded in 2010 by Lei and seven others, Xiaomi seeks to cut costs by eschewing brick-and-mortar stores in favor of web-based distribution and word-of-mouth marketing. Xiaomi became the world’s sixth-largest smartphone vendor in the first quarter of 2014, according to data firm Canalys, after repeatedly doubling its sales. The company was valued at $10 billion last year, drawing industry speculation that the fast-rising company could threaten Apple and Samsung, which dominate the premium market. Xiaomi sold 18.7 million smartphones in 2013 and on Tuesday maintained a 60 million sales target for 2014. For comparison, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] has said it is targeting 80 million smartphone sales for the year.

312,QCOM,"Qualcomm struggles to collect royalties in China, stock falls","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc’s outlook for the September quarter was below Wall Street’s expectations and its shares fell on Wednesday after the leading mobile chipmaker said it was having trouble collecting royalties in China. A new high-speed 4G network in China is driving fresh demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm has also faced legal and regulatory problems there, including an ongoing investigation by the country’s antitrust regulator.  Now Qualcomm is struggling to collect licensing revenue from some device makers in China, including a growing number of local manufacturers the U.S. chipmaker has done little or no business with in the past. “There was some impact in the quarter that we just reported in Q3 and we expect the impact will be larger in the next quarter and potentially for a number of quarters until we can get these things resolved,” Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said in an interview. While most of Qualcomm’s revenue comes from selling chips that enable phones to communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its widespread CDMA cellphone technology. Qualcomm has had royalty disputes in the past in China and the recent proliferation of local companies making low-cost gadgets for Chinese consumers is complicating the picture.  “There’s a lot of new guys ramping up new 4G phones and tablets over there,” said Evercore analyst Mark McKechnie. “They have a lot of licensees there already that are paying them, but this is going to be a pretty big challenge for the company in the coming years.”  With smartphone shipments tapering off in wealthy markets like the United States, China has become a key market for Qualcomm.  The ongoing investigation by China’s anti-monopoly regulator could lead to fines of more than $1 billion. It concerns Qualcomm’s licensing business as well as interactions between its licensing business and its chipset business, Aberle later told analysts on a conference call.  The investigation is making it harder to negotiate new 4G licenses with manufacturers in China, he said. The chipmaker reported third-quarter revenue of $6.81 billion, up 9 percent from the year-ago period. It said revenue in the fourth quarter, which ends in September, would be between $6.5 billion and $7.4 billion, with a midpoint of about $6.95 billion.

The handset, which includes four cameras that track a user’s head movements to enable special screen effects, ships this week to customers in the United States who ordered the device. The phone, powered by a Qualcomm quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, also touts a “Firefly” feature that allows users to point the phone at an object and be directed to Amazon’s online store to buy it. Dismantling a just-delivered Fire handset, tear-down and device-repair specialist iFixit discovered radio frequency, power amplifier, audio and WiFi chips that were also from Qualcomm. As well as the four face-tracking cameras, the phone includes a 13 megapixel rear-facing camera and a 2.1 megapixel front-facing camera. Although those features failed to impress reviewers,  similar features could become prevalent in future handsets launched by other companies. [ID:nL4N0PZ59P] The device opened by iFixit includes 32 gigabytes of NAND memory chips made by Samsung Electronics for storing pictures, music and other media.

319,QCOM,China regulator determines Qualcomm has monopoly: state-run newspaper,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s antitrust regulator has confirmed that Qualcomm Inc, one of the world’s biggest mobile chipmakers, has a monopoly, the state-run Securities Times newspaper reported on Thursday, as Qualcomm’s chief executive held talks in China.   The regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), is investigating Qualcomm’s local subsidiary after it said in February the U.S. chipmaker was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards, allegations which could see it hit with record fines of more than $1 billion. The Securities Times report, based on unidentified sources it said were close to the NDRC, did not say whether the regulator had determined that Qualcomm had abused its monopoly. Angela Zhang, an antitrust expert at King’s College London, said the report was a “loose expression that the NDRC has gathered facts that Qualcomm has abused its dominant position.” “It seems likely that the decision will be announced soon,” she said, noting that having a monopoly alone is not a violation of China’s anti-monopoly law. Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf, who launched a $150 million “strategic venture fund” in China on Thursday, declined to take questions from reporters. A spokeswoman travelling with Mollenkopf also declined to comment on the newspaper report.    The NDRC declined to provide immediate comment. China is a key market for Qualcomm, accounting for nearly half of its revenue. The country is the world’s biggest market for smartphones and is preparing to roll out faster 4G mobile networks this year. While most of Qualcomm’s revenue comes from selling chips that enable phones to communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its widespread CDMA cellphone technology. The Securities Times report said the NDRC was probing Qualcomm’s local sales data and that Qualcomm’s Aberle has been communicating with the NDRC over issues relating to the anti-monopoly investigation.    Analysts say that the process of confirming sales data is common in the late stage of an anti-trust investigation, and that the NDRC is likely calculating the extent of fines. Qualcomm President David Aberle, speaking as the company reported a lower-than-expected outlook for the September quarter on Wednesday, said “some loss would be probable” from the probe. “We are really not in a position to be able to estimate what that might look like, we just believe whatever the resolution may be, will likely include some form of payment,” he added.  Aberle said the investigation concerns Qualcomm’s licensing business as well as interactions between its licensing business and its chipset business, and that the probe was making it harder to negotiate new 4G licenses with manufacturers in China. Qualcomm was also struggling to collect licensing revenue from some device makers in China, including a growing number of local manufacturers it has done little or no business with in the past, Aberle added.  Some Chinese customers of San Diego-based Qualcomm, such as electronics giant TCL Corp, complain the firm is using its dominant market position to charge high patent fees on its chipsets.  Industry experts, however, say the NDRC, which is also the government’s main economic planning body, is trying to lower domestic costs as China rolls out the 4G mobile networks. The Securities Times said Qualcomm was charging lower royalties for patents to undercut competitors who have similar technology and maintain market share. The report also said that Qualcomm, as the only provider of chips for high-end phones, can dictate those fees. During the launch of the China fund, Qualcomm CEO Mollenkopf defended the company’s licensing programme, saying the $30 billion spent in research and development over the company’s lifetime had allowed it to spread its technology in China.  “It’s really why anybody that signs up on a license, actually does it voluntarily – because it is a way of leveraging all of that R and D,” Mollenkopf said. Under China’s six-year-old anti-monopoly law, the NDRC can impose fines of between 1 and 10 percent of a company’s revenues for the previous year. Qualcomm earned $12.3 billion in China for its fiscal year ended September 29, or nearly half of its global sales.   Qualcomm has previously said it is cooperating with the investigation.

324,QCOM,"UPDATE 1-Symantec, Kaspersky downplay Beijing effort to exclude products","(Adds Kaspersky and analysts’ comments) By Soham Chatterjee and Jim Finkle Aug 4 (Reuters) - U.S. security software maker Symantec Corp  and Russia’s Kaspersky Lab downplayed a move by Beijing to exclude them from a list of anti-virus vendors whose products are approved for sale to central government agencies in China. The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, said on its English Twitter feed on Sunday that the government’s procurement agency has excluded Symantec and Kaspersky from a list of security software suppliers. Kaspersky confirmed on Monday that authorities in Beijing had moved to restrict government purchases of software from non-Chinese companies. “Chinese Central Government Procurement Center temporarily rescinded its endorsements of all foreign security providers,” Kaspersky spokeswoman Susan Rivera said. “However, this restriction only applies to national-level institutions whose funding comes from the central government procurement budget, and does not include regional governments or large enterprises.” Symantec said in a statement that the list referred to in Chinese media reports only affected some types of products. “It is important to note that this list is only for certain types of procurement and Symantec products are not banned by the Chinese government,” the statement said.  “We are investigating this report and will continue to bid for and win government projects in China.” Shares of Symantec closed up 1.7 percent at $23.56 on the Nasdaq on Monday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.72 percent. The People’s Daily also tweeted that it had approved the use of five Chinese anti-virus software vendors: Qihoo 360 Technology Co, Venustech, CAJinchen, Beijing Jiangmin and Rising. FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said he sees the development becoming a more contentious issue over the coming months. “It’s another headwind for the company as Symantec already faces numerous challenges to show growth again. China remains a headache situation for Symantec as well as other U.S. tech providers across the board.” Ives said. Symantec said last month it was in talks with Chinese authorities following reports that China had banned use of one of its products, data loss prevention software. Sunday’s report is the latest sign that Beijing is intent on promoting use of domestic information technology amid concerns about U.S. spying and the indictment of five Chinese military officers on cyber espionage charges. Still, Eric Johnson, dean of the business school at Vanderbilt University and an expert on cyber security issues, said the Chinese government’s move is only a “symbolic one” and will have “little meaningful impact” on Symantec. Chinese technology corporations like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp have grown into sophisticated global conglomerates in past years, and some analysts speculate that Beijing is promoting its local industry standard-bearers on its own home turf at the expense of U.S. corporations. Chinese state media have lashed out at Google Inc, Apple Inc and other U.S. technology companies, calling on Beijing “to punish severely the pawns” of the U.S. government for monitoring China and stealing secrets. U.S. tech companies such as Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc have recently faced anti-trust investigations, while IBM Corp and Cisco Systems Inc  have reported declining sales in China.

Calls and emails to Qualcomm’s media relations department in Beijing seeking comment went unanswered. There was no immediate response to emails requesting comment sent to the company’s U.S. headquarters in San Diego. In a short, emailed response to questions from Reuters, Zhang wrote: “(My) individual strength is too insignificant, and the machine of state too powerful. There can only be silence”.

Xinhua said “certain multinational companies” had been attempting to delay such probes into them, including spending money to gain support on experts groups and complaining of being picked on for being foreign. “Against this backdrop, hiring relevant ‘experts’ from government departments to ‘speak on behalf of foreign companies’ is a violation of discipline ...

Xinhua said Zhang had “contravened work discipline” and been removed from his position on the committee, the report said.

The NDRC has said it has targeted domestic telecoms companies, including China Unicom and China Telecom Corp, and domestic financial institutions for anti-trust practices. U.S. companies aside from Qualcomm have also been caught up in the investigations, including software giant Microsoft Corp.

329,QCOM,Qualcomm denies direct financial links with Chinese antitrust expert,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc, under investigation for possible monopolistic practices in China, said it had no direct financial links with an antitrust expert sacked from a government advisory post after state media reported he had received payments from the firm.  The San Diego-based company has been under investigation since November by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), one of China’s three antitrust regulators, over how the company licenses its patents and prices its chipsets.  Qualcomm is among an array of foreign firms that have been scrutinized by the government as China intensifies efforts to bring companies into compliance with its 2008 anti-monopoly law. At stake are financial penalties equivalent to as much as 10 percent of a company’s annual revenue.   As part of the NDRC probe, Qualcomm hired Global Economics Group to produce an economic analysis for submission to the regulator, Christine Trimble, a spokeswoman at the chipset maker, told Reuters on Thursday.  She said the Chicago-based consultancy employed Zhang Xinzhu, a member of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and one of China’s leading antitrust experts, to co-write the report.  Zhang was dismissed from the State Council’s expert commission on competition issues for taking “huge rewards” from Qualcomm, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Wednesday. “Qualcomm paid Global Economics its standard rates for the firm’s services,” Trimble said, and did not have “any financial dealings” with Zhang directly.  David Evans, chairman of Global Economics Group, declined to comment.  The Qualcomm analysis was submitted to the NDRC in May and had three principal authors, including Zhang. Earlier, the 40-year-old professor also provided expert analysis for several domestic conglomerates including China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unionpay, as well as foreign firms involved in antitrust investigations such as Yum!

330,QCOM,UPDATE 3-Qualcomm denies direct financial links with Chinese antitrust expert,"* Chinese academic took “huge rewards” from Qualcomm -Xinhua * Certain multinationals trying to delay probes -Xinhua * European Chamber of Commerce concerned over series of probes   (Adds Qualcomm reaction, background on the academic Zhang) By Ben Blanchard and Matthew Miller BEIJING, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc, under investigation for possible monopolistic practices in China, said it had no direct financial links with an antitrust expert sacked from a government advisory post after state media reported he had received payments from the firm. The San Diego-based company has been under investigation since November by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), one of China’s three antitrust regulators, over how the company licenses its patents and prices its chipsets. Qualcomm is among an array of foreign firms that have been scrutinised by the government as China intensifies efforts to bring companies into compliance with its 2008 anti-monopoly law. At stake are financial penalties equivalent to as much as 10 percent of a company’s annual revenue. As part of the NDRC probe, Qualcomm hired Global Economics Group to produce an economic analysis for submission to the regulator, Christine Trimble, a spokeswoman at the chipset maker, told Reuters on Thursday. She said the Chicago-based consultancy employed Zhang Xinzhu, a member of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and one of China’s leading antitrust experts, to co-write the report. Zhang was dismissed from the State Council’s expert commission on competition issues for taking “huge rewards” from Qualcomm, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Wednesday. “Qualcomm paid Global Economics its standard rates for the firm’s services,” Trimble said, and did not have “any financial dealings” with Zhang directly. David Evans, chairman of Global Economics Group, declined to comment. The Qualcomm analysis was submitted to the NDRC in May and had three principal authors, including Zhang. Earlier, the 40-year-old professor also provided expert analysis for several domestic conglomerates including China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unionpay, as well as foreign firms involved in antitrust investigations such as Yum! Brands Inc. “Hiring economists to provide such economic analysis to antitrust authorities is routine practice in government investigations in China and around the world,” Trimble said.

331,QCOM,China taps South Korea for ideas in Qualcomm antitrust case,"BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - Chinese antitrust officials have met with their South Korean counterparts to discuss violations by U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), sources said, as Beijing reaches out to regulators overseas to complete a case that could result in record fines at home. Qualcomm is one of at least thirty foreign firms to come under scrutiny as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law - efforts some critics say have unfairly targeted overseas businesses, raising protectionism concerns. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fined San Diego-based Qualcomm more than $200 million in 2009 for abusing its dominant market position, but the stakes are bigger in China, where an investigation by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) could trigger changes to Qualcomm’s licensing deals and fines of as much as a tenth of a company’s annual revenue.  Qualcomm had total revenue of almost $25 billion in the year to Sept. 29, 2013, about half of it in China.  “The Chinese authorities were very interested in how South Korea handled such issues and asked a lot of questions about South Korea’s experiences,” said a person who was present at meetings in May and June between the KFTC and the NDRC’s price supervision and anti-monopoly bureau.   It’s unlikely the NDRC could use exactly the same rationale as South Korea against Qualcomm, added the person, who didn’t want to be named because of the sensitivity of the case.  “What China takes most exception to is that royalties on intellectual properties are comparatively higher in China. But high price itself shouldn’t be an antitrust matter. It’s only a problem when there are elements like discriminatory practices,” the person said. Qualcomm has been under investigation by the NDRC, one of China’s three antitrust regulators, since November last year over how it licenses its patents and prices its chipsets.  Exchanges between regulators are not uncommon, but some experts say the NDRC has relied on pressure tactics instead of detailed economic analysis to drive its cases. That the NDRC went to the KFTC months after the case was announced, they say, could indicate the bureau is looking for a legal justification for a case it had already launched. There are concerns that a central aim of the meetings between China and South Korea was to “solicit advice in an economic argument against Qualcomm,” a person in the U.S. business community familiar with the case said. “It’s putting the cart before the horse. They have reached a conclusion and attempted to get the facts later,” the person said. In a statement about the meeting that took place in South Korea, the KFTC said: “China’s NDRC, seeking to advance its regulatory enforcement, requested that the Fair Trade Commission share economic analysis techniques used to deal with actual cases.” A KFTC official declined to comment further on the meetings when contacted by Reuters. The NDRC antitrust bureau, its delegation led by Director General Xu Kunlin, said in statements issued after the meetings that the two sides held “thorough exchanges”. The NDRC did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. None of the statements specifically mentioned Qualcomm. Xu, an outspoken advocate of expanding the use of China’s anti-monopoly law, has publicly stated that his bureau is hamstrung by under-staffing. That, lawyers say, is one likely element behind the bureau’s reputation of employing less rigorous analysis in its investigations. At a conference in May, Xu said that because he had only around 40 staff - compared to hundreds at U.S. and European agencies - he had to rely on tip-offs of violations when pursuing cases. “If you increased my staff by 100 workers, perhaps then I could actively investigate,” he said. “I think everybody would agree they are understaffed – they don’t have enough people – and they are very new at this,” said Peter Wang, an antitrust expert and Shanghai-based partner for law firm Jones Day. “It’s often easy to find theories for possible antitrust problems, but it takes an extensive amount of experience to be in a position to make good decisions about when something is likely to be a real problem and, just as important, when it’s not.” Nonetheless, a slew of recent high-profile probes into overseas firms has rekindled concerns that Beijing may be using the investigations to support domestic industry. The NDRC this week fined Japanese auto parts makers a record 1.235 billion yuan ($201 million) for manipulating prices in China.  The agency has also said it would punish Audi (NSUG.DE) and Fiat SpA’s FIA.MI Chrysler for monopoly practices, and last year hit foreign milk powder makers with hefty fines.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce in April sent a private letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew urging Washington to get tough with Beijing on its use of the Anti-Monopoly Law to pursue “China’s industrial policy goals”.  The issue was raised at high-level strategic talks between Washington and Beijing in July. The NDRC’s Xu told Reuters recently his agency gives equal treatment to all market participants.

The sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 21. Co-defendant Derek Cohen, who was also a director in Qualcomm’s North America sales department, has pleaded not guilty. Qualcomm is based in San Diego. Federal authorities said Herman and Cohen invested more than $500,000 in Atheros stock and options on Jan. 4, 2011, soon after learning about Qualcomm’s plan to buy the company, which was announced officially the following day.  News of the $3.2 billion acquisition leaked a few hours after the defendants made their purchases, prompting them to sell their holdings and reap nearly $230,000 of profit, prosecutors said. Herman’s share was $29,318, they added. According to a parallel U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil complaint, Herman and Cohen claimed during an internal Qualcomm investigation of possible insider trading  that they learned about the Atheros acquisition from news media.

340,QCOM,U.S. business lobby says concerned China antitrust probes unfair,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Foreign companies are increasingly concerned they are being targeted by Chinese regulators, a U.S. business lobby said on Tuesday, as a Chinese antitrust agency defended probes into firms such as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O).  The American Chamber of Commerce in China is the latest business lobby to air its grievances over a series of investigations scrutinizing at least 30 foreign firms, as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law. There are growing perceptions that multinational firms are under “selective and subjective enforcement” using “legal and extra-legal approaches”, the Chamber said in a report. A survey of 164 members showed 49 percent of respondents felt foreign companies were being singled out in recent pricing and anti-corruption campaigns, compared to 40 percent in a late 2013 survey of 365 members. Twenty-five percent said they were uncertain, or did not know, and 26 percent said no. Chamber Vice Chairman Lester Ross told reporters the major expansion of enforcement was welcome in principle, but regulators were using “extra-legal” means to conduct investigations. “They have taken what are, in many instances, vague or unspecified provisions in the law and moved to enforce them, and  sought to enforce those means through processes that do not respect the notion of due process or fairness,” Ross said. Sixty percent of respondents in the survey also reported they felt foreign business was becoming less welcome in China. In an April letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Washington to get tough with Beijing on its use of anti-competition rules, which it said had been seized by China to advance industrial policies that nurture domestic companies. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China in August expressed its concern over the antitrust investigations, saying China was using strong-arm tactics and appeared to be unfairly targeting foreign firms. Xu Kunlin, director general of price supervision and the anti-monopoly bureau at the National Development Reform Commission (NDRC), reiterated that local and foreign companies were being treated equally by the agency. “Such accusations are groundless and baseless,” Xu told the official China Daily newspaper. “Some of the NDRC monopoly investigations involve overseas multinationals, but that does not mean that we are targeting them,” Xu said in an interview with the paper.  “Some business operators in China have failed to adjust their practices in accordance with the anti-monopoly law,” he added. “Others have a clear understanding of the laws, but they take the chance that they may escape punishment.”  Xu said the NDRC, one of China’s three antitrust regulators, was also handling cases involving state-owned firms and Chinese private sector companies. The automotive industry has been in focus for the last two or three years, Xu said. Last month, the NDRC slapped a record fine of $201 million on 12 Japanese automakers it said had engaged in price manipulation. The NDRC is investigating Qualcomm’s local subsidiary after it said in February that the company was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards, accusations that could lead to record fines of more than $1 billion. Another antitrust regulator, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said on Monday it had given Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) 20 days to reply to queries on the compatibility of its Windows operating system and Office software suite amid its probe into the world’s largest software company. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang responded to a question on the chamber’s paper at a regular press briefing, saying he hoped foreign companies “will abide by Chinese law”. “Anti-monopoly is to protect consumers’ rights and to create a more open, fair and impartial market environment,” Qin said. “It is transparent and just.” ",9022014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-antitrust-ndrc/u-s-business-lobby-says-concerned-china-antitrust-probes-unfair-idUSKBN0GX04820140902

349,QCOM,U.S. antitrust official concerned by China anti-competition stance,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. antitrust enforcer expressed concern on Wednesday about China’s enforcement of its antitrust law after Beijing opened a probe into Qualcomm Inc for allegedly abusing its market position. China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which is among the agencies that enforce antitrust law, said in February that the U.S. chipmaker was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards. The allegations could mean fines of more than $1 billion. In Washington, Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez noted media reports that Beijing may decide to prosecute a company based on the royalty payments that it demands to use its patents. Ramirez did not mention Qualcomm by name but said: “I am seriously concerned by these reports, which suggest an enforcement policy focused on reducing royalty payments for local implementers as a matter of industrial policy, rather than protecting competition and long-run consumer welfare.” In July, a Chinese state-run newspaper said China’s NDRC had determined that Qualcomm had a monopoly but did not say whether the regulator had determined that the company had abused this monopoly. Qualcomm, one of the world’s biggest mobile chipmakers, is one of at least 30 foreign firms to come under scrutiny as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law which some critics say is being used to unfairly target overseas businesses, raising protectionism concerns. Also in Washington, Joaquin Almunia, the top European antitrust enforcer, warned against criticism of other jurisdictions with different laws.  “I think we need to be careful in assessing how competition enforcement is carried out in different jurisdictions than our own,” he said at a press conference when asked about China. But he said that he had been disappointed that China had not yet joined the International Competition Network, an informal network of competition agencies from 92 jurisdictions, and said that cooperation with China when both Beijing and Brussels were working on the same issue fell short. “With the Chinese we are still at the starting point of this cooperation,” he said. Companies being investigated in China for antitrust issues include Microsoft Corp and automaker Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE). This week, the NDRC slapped a record $201 million fine on 12 Japanese automakers it said had engaged in price manipulation.",9102014,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-antitrust/u-s-antitrust-official-concerned-by-china-anti-competition-stance-idUSKBN0H52EG20140910

352,QCOM,UPDATE 2-China's antitrust regulators defend probes; Qualcomm inquiry nearly over,"(Adds quotes, background) By Michael Martina and Xiaoyi Shao BEIJING, Sept 11 (Reuters) - China’s three anti-monopoly regulators on Thursday launched a vigorous defence of their recent investigations into foreign companies, which have prompted mounting international criticism, and said they are not targeting multinational firms. At least 30 foreign firms, including U.S. companies such as Qualcomm Inc and Microsoft Corp, have come under scrutiny as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law that some critics say is being used to unfairly target overseas businesses, raising protectionism concerns. “Our anti-trust enforcement work is strictly conducted according to regulations,” said Xu Kunlin, director general of the National Development and Reform Commission’s (NDRC) Price Supervision and Inspection and Anti-Monopoly Bureau. “It is fair and transparent. It is not targeting any market player, and of course, it is not targeting any foreign invested or foreign enterprises.” Xu added the investigation of Qualcomm, one of the world’s biggest makers of mobile chips, was “basically done” and that the NDRC planned to meet the company’s president, Derek Aberle, on Friday. Thursday’s rare joint press conference, which also included anti-trust heads from the Ministry of Commerce and State Administration for Industry and Commerce, showed the regulators presenting a united front. It comes days after Premier Li Keqiang defended at a global forum a series of probes into overseas companies amid snowballing concern from the foreign business community. In the last two weeks, four leading international business lobbies have raised alarm over the investigations. Their complaints range from worries that foreign companies are being unfairly targeted by probes motivated by China’s industrial policy aims, to concerns over the use of strong-arm tactics by Chinese regulators. On Wednesday, U.S. Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez spoke publicly about reports of China’s enforcement of its anti-trust law and its investigation of Qualcomm. “I am seriously concerned by these reports, which suggest an enforcement policy focused on reducing royalty payments for local implementers as a matter of industrial policy, rather than protecting competition and long-run consumer welfare,” Ramirez said, without mentioning Qualcomm by name. Xu, said he had read the reports thoroughly but dismissed them as unrepresentative and lacking a factual basis. “We asked some of the companies we were investigating about the criticism in these reports. The companies told me they didn’t know why they would issue these kinds of statements. They said they didn’t make those criticisms and they didn’t represent their opinions,” Xu said. “Our communication with all of the companies we are investigating is extremely free-flowing.” China’s anti-trust enforcers have gone after an array of industries, including foreign automakers and tech firms. Last month, the NDRC fined Japanese auto parts makers a record 1.235 billion yuan ($201 million) for manipulating prices. The Qualcomm case could yield record fines of more than $1 billion. Regulators also on Thursday announced their first-ever punishments of foreign carmakers for price-fixing, fining a Chinese venture of Volkswagen AG and the China sales unit of Fiat’s Chrysler a combined $46 million. Qualcomm Executive Chairman Paul Jacobs declined to comment when asked about Aberle’s meeting. “We have a good business in China and we work very closely with the partners here,” Jacobs said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum event in China’s northern city of Tianjin. Separately, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) defended its investigation of Microsoft Corp., the world’s biggest software company. Earlier this month, SAIC gave Microsoft 20 days to reply to queries on the compatibility of its Windows operating system and Office software suite. Director General Ren Airong, of SAIC’s Anti-monopoly and Anti-unfair Competition Enforcement Bureau, said that “many firms” had reported that Microsoft was suspected of monopoly practices. Ren also said that Microsoft had “more lawyers” than any case the regulator has investigated and that the SAIC’s “every move” was conducted under their view. The regulators said they were focused on domestic firms as well as foreign companies, though critics argue that fines on Chinese companies are typically lower. China took action against white liquor makers Kweichow Moutai Group and Wuliangye Group, imposing more than $70 million in fines collectively. They also have fined local insurance companies and cement producers. On Tuesday, China’s Premier Li Keqiang waded into the fray, telling executives that the investigations were conducted “legally, transparently and fairly”, in some of the highest level official comments on the issue to date. Li said that only 10 percent of companies impacted by anti-trust investigations were foreign.

353,QCOM,Sharp aims to mass-produce new generation of display panels by 2017,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Sharp Corp said it would begin mass-producing a new type of next-generation displays with Qualcomm unit Pixtronix from 2017, in the hopes that innovation would pay off in the long term as the firm nurses its finances back to health.  Qualcomm and Sharp said the new type of panel, called MEMS-IGZO after their respective display technologies, uses less energy and can withstand harsher temperatures than the liquid crystal displays (LCD) used in most smartphones and tablets.  “LCD is really hitting its limits in a lot of things. We can go brighter and this is the first generation of this technology,” said Greg Heinzinger, senior vice president of Qualcomm’s technology licensing division and president of Pixtronix, at a briefing at Sharp’s Tokyo office on Friday.  Sharp is hoping that innovative display technologies can sustain its recovery from a massive 545.4 billion yen ($5.34 billion) net loss in the year to March 2013, with its dependence on panels for operating profit approaching 50 percent. The MEMS-IGZO panels, which use a high-speed shutter to display images, boast brighter colours than LCD panels as they do not require a color filter, allowing more illumination from the backlight.  Sharp said it will market the new technology to automakers, and makers of industrial devices, smartphones and tablets, and aims to start mass-production in 2017. It has built a test line for the technology at its factory in Tottori prefecture on Japan’s northern coast.  Before then, Sharp hopes to release curved LCD panels with its ‘Free Form Display’ technology, unveiled in June, which it showcased on Friday with a car dashboard featuring three illuminated circular dials.  Qualcomm entered a capital alliance with Sharp in December 2012, investing 10.8 billion yen in the company over the following six months, making it Sharp’s third-largest shareholder at end-March.

Qualcomm and Sharp said the new type of panel, called MEMS-IGZO after their respective display technologies, uses less energy and can withstand harsher temperatures than the liquid crystal displays (LCD) used in most smartphones and tablets. “LCD is really hitting its limits in a lot of things. We can go brighter and this is the first generation of this technology,” said Greg Heinzinger, senior vice president of Qualcomm’s technology licensing division and president of Pixtronix, at a briefing at Sharp’s Tokyo office on Friday. Sharp is hoping that innovative display technologies can sustain its recovery from a massive 545.4 billion yen ($5.34 billion) net loss in the year to March 2013, with its dependence on panels for operating profit approaching 50 percent. The MEMS-IGZO panels, which use a high-speed shutter to display images, boast brighter colours than LCD panels as they do not require a colour filter, allowing more illumination from the backlight. Sharp said it will market the new technology to automakers, and makers of industrial devices, smartphones and tablets, and aims to start mass-production in 2017. It has built a test line for the technology at its factory in Tottori prefecture on Japan’s northern coast. Before then, Sharp hopes to release curved LCD panels with its ‘Free Form Display’ technology, unveiled in June, which it showcased on Friday with a car dashboard featuring three illuminated circular dials. Qualcomm entered a capital alliance with Sharp in December 2012, investing 10.8 billion yen in the company over the following six months, making it Sharp’s third-largest shareholder at end-March.

With an explosion in smartphones in recent years tapering off, Qualcomm and handset manufacturers are eager to show consumers and investors that they have more innovation in store to drive demand for new devices. The company discussed progress in 4G LTE and technology and 3D cameras, but demonstrations of robots made with Qualcomm smartphone technology stole much of the show. Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf demonstrated a three-wheeled robot that picked up and sorted a number of small toys such as stuffed animals and building blocks, based on their shapes. In another demonstration, engineers quickly trained a one-foot tall robot decked out with wheels, glowing ears and camera sensors to come and go based on simple hand gestures. “The concept that a processor can enable a product to learn a behavior and change behavior based on learning is powerful,” said Qualcomm Senior Vice President Raj Talluri. “Now imagine your phone ... You buy a phone and it learns your behavior and in time the phone starts getting better and better and more and more personal.” Global smartphone shipments will increase 19 percent this year, less than last year’s 39 percent growth and driven by the adoption in developing countries of handsets selling for under $150, according to Juniper Research.

It was unclear how much Intel is paying or what portion of the companies the U.S. chipmaker is buying. The acquisition could be made through Tsinghua Unigroup, a government-affiliated private equity firm controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing, one of the sources said. Tsinghua Unigroup owns Spreadtrum and RDA. Intel, which has struggled to gain traction in the smartphone and tablet market, recently has sought to partner with mobile chipmakers in the hope they can help it gain the market dominance it has enjoyed with personal computers. An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Tsinghua Unigroup did not respond immediately to a request for comment. This week there have been several reports in China of a potential deal, including one on the sina.com.cn news portal quoting unnamed sources as saying Intel would get 20 percent of Tsinghua Unigroup for $1.5 billion. The Beijing government has said in published policy papers it views semiconductors as an industry of vital strategic importance and hopes to spur its development domestically. China is the world’s largest smartphone manufacturer and smartphone market. Intel, under Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, has pursued an array of deals and strategies to ensure its chip technology gets  into more smartphones and tablets. The newest investment comes less than six months after Intel reached an agreement with Chinese chip maker Rockchip to make inexpensive tablet chips with Intel’s architecture and branding. Since taking over as Intel’s CEO last year, Krzanich has also opened the chipmaker’s prized, cutting-edge factories to paying customers. More recently he has struck partnerships in the fashion world with companies such as Fossil Group  and Opening Ceremony to design stylish smart clothing. “Intel’s new CEO has proven to be willing to take on new partnerships and approach new business opportunities that stray from prior conventions,” said Suji Da Silva, an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets. “They should do as much of this as they need to be in markets that are important to them.” While Intel excels at developing processors for laptops and desktop computers, it has less experience designing “system on chips” or SoCs, the key processors on mobile devices, which combine features such as modems, WiFi and memory. The company’s stock has risen 32 percent this year, in part because of stabilization of demand for personal computers.

367,QCOM,UPDATE 3-Intel to invest up to $1.5 bln in two Chinese mobile chipmakers,"(Adds confirmation of the deal) By Gerry Shih and Noel Randewich BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Intel Corp  said it will pay as much as $1.5 billion for a 20 percent stake in two mobile chipmakers with ties to the Chinese government, in the hopes of catching up in a smartphone chip industry dominated by rival Qualcomm Inc. Intel will acquire the stake in Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics through a deal with Tsinghua Unigroup, a government-affiliated private equity firm which owns the two mobile chipmakers. The U.S. semiconductor company, more known for chips used in personal computers, has struggled to gain traction in the smartphone and tablet market. The landmark deal would give Intel a greater foothold in the Chinese mobile chip market, which has become a nexus of the global smartphone industry. Conversely, the deal would provide two Chinese chipmakers support from a U.S. semiconductor giant on chip design and development, an area deemed to be of vital strategic importance by the government in Beijing. “It has become a national priority of China to grow its semiconductor industry,” said Tsinghua Unigroup Chairman Zhao Weiguo in a statement released by Intel on Friday. “The strategic collaboration between Tsinghua Unigroup and Intel ranges from design and development to marketing and equity investments, which demonstrate Intel’s confidence in the Chinese market and strong commitment to Chinese semiconductor industry.” Speculation of the deal has been rife in the Chinese press for several weeks. The announcement confirmed a report by Reuters earlier Friday. Intel’s stake will be via a newly created holding company that owns the units Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics, Unigroup said, adding that the deal is still waiting for government approval. Unigroup is controlled by the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing. The institution counts China’s President Xi Jinping as one of its alumni. The government in Beijing has said in published policy papers that it views semiconductors as an industry of vital strategic importance and hopes to spur its development domestically.

368,QCOM,Intel gains a new ally in China's chip wars: Beijing,"BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel’s investment of up to $1.5 billion in two fast-growing Chinese mobile chipmakers has effectively aligned the U.S. giant with a third party - a Beijing government intent on producing a viable domestic challenger to the likes of Qualcomm and Samsung. For more than a decade, China has targeted semiconductor design and manufacture as a major focus of its industrial policy. Activity has picked up markedly over the past year with a spate of cross-border mergers and cooperation deals. “We’ve entered an inflection point where government policy has started to work - it’s started to help the local semiconductor industry,” said Nomura analyst Leping Huang. The deal hashed out by Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich over 24 hours in Beijing in early August extends Intel’s beachhead in China, the biggest battleground in the smartphone industry, and boosts the company’s years-long effort to catch up to leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. A key visit during the trip was to Yang Xueshan, the deputy chief of China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), who gave his blessing for the deal. The agreement, unveiled on Sept. 26, gives Intel a 20 percent stake in Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics through shares in a Tsinghua University holding company, with the aim of jointly developing and marketing smartphone chips. China is the world’s largest consumer and manufacturer of smartphones yet relies heavily on imported chips - particularly the processors that power the latest devices - made by San Diego-based Qualcomm, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co, or MediaTek Inc of Taiwan. China’s ramped-up activity also arrives on the heels of revelations about the U.S. surveillance program PRISM, which has prompted Beijing to undertake a slew of actions to enhance the security of its information technology industry. For Intel, the world’s leading manufacturer of chips for personal computers, the Tsinghua deal offers an additional path into the world’s biggest chip market after it was slow to recognize the mobile revolution and design new processors for smartphones and tablets.  Intel spokesman John Mandeville declined to comment. The China Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that revenue from China’s chip industry reached 251 billion yuan($40.98 billion) in 2013, while domestic demand for chips amounted to 917 billion yuan, representing more than half of global semiconductor consumption. Deng Zhonghan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and National People’s Congress, said in March that China’s $210 billion worth of annual chip imports exceeds the value of the country’s entire yearly petroleum imports. In June, the State Council offered the country’s most comprehensive guidelines for the development of the semiconductor industry, outlining specific revenue targets for 2015 and 2020, with chip revenue set to grow at a better-than 20 percent annual clip, to reach 350 billion yuan by 2020. An important part of Beijing’s effort, analysts and industry insiders say, was consolidation of Spreadtrum and RDA, two companies formerly trading independently on Nasdaq. The two companies were acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion and $900 million respectively by Tsinghua Unigroup, government-affiliated private equity group controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing. As part of its recent deal, which is expected to close early next year, Intel and Unigroup will form a new holding company that contains Spreadtrum and RDA. Beijing wants the Unigroup companies to become competitive with Taiwan’s MediaTek within five years and overtake Qualcomm within 10 years, according to a person familiar with Unigroup. Since taking over in 2013, Krzanich has aggressively positioned Intel to catch up with Qualcomm, the leading mobile chipset maker. A central part of that strategy is China, where consumers are snapping up low-end smartphones made with low-cost chips from local suppliers like Spreadtrum and MediaTek. Intel started investing in local operations 20 years ago, and presently operates factories across the country for manufacturing, assembling and testing microprocessors. Intel also has research and development operations in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.  In May, Intel said it reached an agreement with Fuzhou-based Rockchip to produce chips for tablets based on Intel’s architecture. “With China, what they want is for you to be a true partner,” Krzanich told reporters in September. “We go in and we partner, we build factories, we build R&D; and we help local companies.” Intel’s deal with Tsinghua Unigroup comes three months after Qualcomm agreed to partner with Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China’s largest foundry, to produce some of Qualcomm’s smartphone chips. As part of the agreement, Qualcomm will help SMIC implement its first high-end 28 nanometer manufacturing technology. It also coincides with a year-long Chinese anti-monopoly investigation into Qualcomm. Critics say the probe unfairly targets foreign companies in order to help domestic companies, which Chinese authorities flatly deny. Krzanich first discussed ways to collaborate with the Chinese firms during a visit to Tsinghua University in April, where he and Intel China head Yang Xu met Tsinghua Holding’s Xu Jinhong, Unigroup’s Zhou Weiguo, Spreadtrum founder Li Liyou, who is also a Tsinghua University alumnus. He made a second trip to Beijing, the whirlwind visit in August, after which the deal fell into place. “Tsinghua University is an important driving force for the development of national science and technology, and Tsinghua Holdings is a key part of that effort,” Tsinghua Holdings Chief Executive Xu Jinhong told Reuters by email. Xu characterized the Intel investment as “a new model for cooperation between Chinese and U.S. companies in the chip industry.” Analysts say that Intel’s deal will give the Santa Clara-based company a moderate boost by gaining a partner with strong relationships with local phone manufacturers. The deal should also give Intel enough protection of its intellectual property through licensing arrangements and other conditions, said Scott Kennedy, director of the Research Centre for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University. “There’s potential benefits for everyone,” Kennedy said.

369,QCOM,Intel gains a new ally in China's chip wars - Beijing,"BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 14 (Reuters) - Intel’s investment of up to $1.5 billion in two fast-growing Chinese mobile chipmakers has effectively aligned the U.S. giant with a third party - a Beijing government intent on producing a viable domestic challenger to the likes of Qualcomm and Samsung. For more than a decade, China has targeted semiconductor design and manufacture as a major focus of its industrial policy. Activity has picked up markedly over the past year with a spate of cross-border mergers and cooperation deals. “We’ve entered an inflection point where government policy has started to work - it’s started to help the local semiconductor industry,” said Nomura analyst Leping Huang. The deal hashed out by Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich over 24 hours in Beijing in early August extends Intel’s beachhead in China, the biggest battleground in the smartphone industry, and boosts the company’s years-long effort to catch up to leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. A key visit during the trip was to Yang Xueshan, the deputy chief of China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), who gave his blessing for the deal. The agreement, unveiled on Sept. 26, gives Intel a 20 percent stake in Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics through shares in a Tsinghua University holding company, with the aim of jointly developing and marketing smartphone chips. China is the world’s largest consumer and manufacturer of smartphones yet relies heavily on imported chips - particularly the processors that power the latest devices - made by San Diego-based Qualcomm, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co , or MediaTek Inc of Taiwan. China’s ramped-up activity also arrives on the heels of revelations about the U.S. surveillance programme PRISM, which has prompted Beijing to undertake a slew of actions to enhance the security of its information technology industry. For Intel, the world’s leading manufacturer of chips for personal computers, the Tsinghua deal offers an additional path into the world’s biggest chip market after it was slow to recognize the mobile revolution and design new processors for smartphones and tablets.

370,QCOM,U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm hopes for knock-out blow with $2.5 billion CSR bid,"LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) agreed to buy CSR Plc CSR.L for $2.5 billion, offering what it hopes is a knock-out blow to win the British Bluetooth specialist which is growing in areas like automotive and wearable devices. Qualcomm, the world’s number one mobile chipmaker, has agreed to pay 900 pence a share in cash for CSR, a 56.5 percent premium on the share price before the start of the offer period in August, CSR said on Wednesday. At that time, the British company rebuffed an approach from U.S. chipmaker Microchip Technology (MCHP.O), saying its undisclosed offer was not enough. The two had remained in talks to reach a deal, with a deadline imposed by UK regulators for Wednesday.         There is a chance alternative bidders may emerge, Jeffries analyst Robert Lamb told investors in a research note, although he cautioned that the high multiple relative to recent chip mergers which Qualcomm is paying may prove difficult to trump. “With a firm price now in the open, it could tempt others to play their hand,” Lamb said. Qualcomm Chief Executive Steven M. Mollenkopf said the addition of CSR would allow it to diversify into the markets for short-range, wireless Bluetooth chips and audio processing used in portable audio, automotive controls and wearable devices. “Combining CSR’s highly advanced offering of connectivity technologies with a strong track record of success in these areas will unlock new opportunities for growth,” he said. Qualcomm, the dominant maker of chips used in smartphones, has been looking to expand beyond the phone market into emerging areas such as wireless home appliances and other connected devices that fly under the banner of “The Internet of Things.” In May, it agreed to acquire Wilocity, a maker of wireless HDMI connections, used to transmit video between computers and displays, and it developed AllJoyn, an open-source platform that allows devices to share information with other nearby devices. CSR Chief Executive Joep van Beurden said the two companies were a good combination. “If you look at us, we are focused on all the accessories around the phone,” he told Reuters. “In voice and music, we are strong in headsets, soundbars and speaker docks; and we are strong in cars, which more and more are an extension of the phone with infotainment.” Jeffries analyst Lamb labeled the merger “a good fit”, advising clients that, “Clearly they (Qualcomm) have gone down the ‘buy’ rather than ‘make’ route.” CSR, short for Cambridge Silicon Radio, specializes in connectivity, with its chips used in products such as portable audio speakers and Apple-owned (AAPL.O) Beats headphones. It was a pioneer in the market for wireless Bluetooth technology, which is now mushrooming in popularity for use in wireless audio speakers, network-connected appliances in homes and for use in so-called “connected car” features in autos. Microchip, a diversified maker of analog and digital chips based in Chandler, Arizona, together with CSR, had announced in late August that they were in preliminary talks on a merger. Last week, Microchip shocked stock markets worldwide by warning it expected lower quarterly sales and going further to make a sweeping prediction that the chip industry at large was likely to suffer a broad downturn over the coming quarters.

373,QCOM,INSIGHT-Big Tech winning battle with 'patent trolls',"Oct 22 (Reuters) - For two decades, companies that buy software patents to sue technology giants have been the scourge of Silicon Valley. Reviled as patent trolls, they have attacked everything from Google’s online ads to Apple’s iPhone features, sometimes winning hundreds of millions of dollars. But now the trolls are in retreat from the tech titans, interviews and data reviewed by Reuters show. In the wake of several changes in U.S. law, which make it easier to challenge software patents, patent prices are plummeting, the number of court fights is down, and stock prices of many patent-holding companies have fallen. Some tech firms say they are punching up research budgets as legal costs shrink, while support for major patent reform is under fire as trolls get trounced. “Their entire business model relies on intimidation, and that has lost its edge,” said Efrat Kasznik, president of intellectual property consulting firm Foresight Valuation Group. “If the patents are not enforceable in court anymore... the troll has no legs to stand on.” Brokers who work with the patent acquisition companies acknowledge the new climate. “In some cases, there are just no current buyers for these patents at all,” said Robert Aronoff, founder of the patent brokerage Pluritas, citing new legal standards for the change. NetApp, a Silicon Valley maker of sophisticated data storage devices, last month used a new legal precedent to force a patent holder to pay its legal fees. The judge called the case “reckless and wasteful.” The new playing field allows NetApp to spend more on developing its own patents, as opposed to litigation defense. “It is freeing up dollars,” said Douglas Luftman, NetApp’s chief intellectual property counsel. To be sure, not all litigious patent owning companies are losing ground. Some with court-tested patents are doing well. And not all big tech companies are convinced of the change. Cisco Systems Inc has been at the forefront of the fight against infringement lawsuits and has not seen a drop in new suits in recent months, said General Counsel Mark Chandler. Cisco will continue to push for laws to stop warrantless lawsuits, Chandler said. Others see the need diminishing. Big tech companies distinguish between their own intellectual property, which they fiercely protect, and those of their adversaries, which they often dismiss as broadly worded and vague, allowing holders to sue all manner of defendants. The big tech companies note that the patent acquisition companies they label as trolls generally make no products but are solely in the business of buying patents and litigating to enforce them. The putative trolls see a different world. They buy patents from inventors and each other, creating a marketplace that checks big tech companies’ sway, and rely ultimately on a fair arbiter: courts. This can provide vital protection for investors’ ideas, said Matt Vella, CEO of Acacia Research Corp, which contracts with owners to license their patents to other companies. “I see it as a Robin Hood function,” he said. If the so-called trolls had a birth date, it would be the summer of 1994, when a federal appeals court explicitly allowed computer program patents for the first time. In the ensuing years, software patents exploded, covering topics from Wi-Fi to one-click shopping. So did patent lawsuits. Last year, more than 6,000 patent suits were filed, according to intellectual property analytics firm Lex Machina. A 2013 White House report said “trolls” were responsible for 60 percent of suits, up from 29 percent in 2010. Congress struck the first blow against these high-volume plaintiffs in an overhaul of the patent system. Starting in 2012, companies accused of infringement could ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to invalidate patents used in litigation. The reviews are much cheaper and faster than court. The reviews proved popular — and devastating for many patent owners. As of June, the patent office was invalidating some or all of challenged patents’ claims at a rate of 80 to 90 percent, depending on the type of review. Then, in June of this year, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a basic idea — not normally eligible for a patent — does not become patent-worthy if run on a computer. That case, Alice vs. CLS Bank, has made it easier still to quash software patents, and at least 13 lower court rulings since then have done just that. New federal patent lawsuits last month were down 40 percent from the previous year, to 329 cases, data from Lex Machina show. Defendants are also fighting longer, driving up costs for the acquisition companies. In 2004, the median time it took for a case that didn’t settle was 467 days. By 2013, that had reached 673 days, according to Lex Machina. Intellectual Ventures, one of the largest private patent buyers, laid off over 20 percent of its workforce this year. The company began with backing from big tech companies who saw it as an ally, but some longtime investors including Apple and Intel declined to participate in its latest funding round. Intellectual Ventures declined to comment. A survey of private patent deals compiled by brokerage IPOfferings, found the average price of a patent was $165,000 in the second quarter of 2014, down from $375,000 in 2012. Some patents have withstood challenges under the new legal rules, however. Marathon Patent Group announced last month that the U.S. government rejected a request by ARM Holdings to invalidate a Marathon patent. Marathon is trading up 28 percent since mid-June. Michael Friedman, managing director at IP strategy firm Ocean Tomo, said patents on widely used technology owned by companies like IBM, Microsoft and Qualcomm, are still in a strong position to seek licenses. But some companies whose business model depends on successful litigation have seen their stock slide since Alice, the 2014 Supreme Court case. InterDigital has fallen over 5 percent and Acacia Research Corp is down over 9 percent. (See graphic: link.reuters.com/rej23w) Just three weeks after Alice was decided, an Acacia Research subsidiary felt its reach when a federal appeals court backed the revocation of a patent on digital image processing, used to sue over 30 tech firms. Acacia is appealing and said that in general, its other patents will not be impacted by Alice in the same way, since few deal with the kinds of software methods Alice puts at risk. Still, Vella, Acacia’s CEO, said, said his company sensed the changing legal landscape and is shifting its strategy, away from one-patent cases to challenges based on several patents.

375,QCOM,"Qualcomm sees more China trouble, faces probes in U.S., Europe","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) warned on Wednesday that an antitrust investigation and problems collecting royalties could harm its business in China next year and it also disclosed new regulatory investigations in the United States and Europe. China’s expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm’s opportunities have been clouded by an 11-month-old antitrust investigation there. Wall Street is worried. Qualcomm could face a fine of more than $1 billion in China as a result of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) investigation, and the company could be forced to make concessions that would hurt its highly profitable business of charging royalties on phones that use its patents. Qualcomm also said it faces a new probe by the European Commission about rebates and other financial incentives in the sale of its chips. Another preliminary investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission concerns a potential breach of licensing terms, the company said. On Wednesday, Qualcomm’s shares slid about 6 percent at $72.50 in extended trading from a $77.20 close on the Nasdaq. “We’re continuing to cooperate with the NDRC. We’ve continued to meet with them regularly, exchange some ideas for potential ways to resolve it,” Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said in a telephone interview. “But we don’t have an ability to update in terms of expectations and timing.” Qualcomm has also been struggling to collect licensing revenue from some device makers in China, including local manufacturers the U.S. chipmaker has done little or no business with in the past. Any concessions on royalties that Qualcomm is forced to make in China could spread to manufacturers in other countries, some investors said. “What people are most worried about is the ability to fence in this issue to Chinese vendors if there’s a reduced royalty rate, or does it spread to other geographies,” Standard Life portfolio manager Brian Fox said.  Qualcomm said it was difficult to predict the outcome of the U.S. and European investigations.  The European probe is separate from a four-year-old complaint to the European Commission from a subsidiary of Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) over alleged patent-related incentives and exclusionary pricing by Qualcomm. Qualcomm forecast revenue for fiscal 2015 of between $26.8 billion and $28.8 billion. Analysts on average expected $28.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also expects non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2015 to be between $5.05 and $5.35. Analysts on average expected $5.58. The chipmaker reported revenue of $6.69 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, ended Sept. 28, up 3 percent from the year-ago period. Analysts on average had expected $7.016 billion.

385,QCOM,UPDATE 1-Samsung Elec fires back at Nvidia with chip patents lawsuit,"* Nvidia sued Samsung, Qualcomm for patent infringement in Sept * Samsung says will defend intellectual property rights   (Updates with comments from Samsung, background) SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  has accused Nvidia Corp of infringing several of its chip-related patents and for making false claims about its products, counter-suing after Nvidia filed a suit against the Korean company in September. Samsung Electronics, which filed a lawsuit in a U.S. federal court on Nov. 4, is seeking damages for deliberate infringement of several technical patents, including a few that govern the way semiconductors buffer and use data. The South Korean firm, the world’s largest smartphone maker, also accuses Nvidia of false advertising when it says its “Shield” tablet sports the world’s fastest mobile processor, the Tegra. Samsung Electronics cites benchmarking studies performed by researchers at Primate Labs as proving that claim false. “We are pursuing necessary legal measures to defend our intellectual property rights and to ensure our continued growth in the IT industry,” Samsung Electronics said in an emailed statement. Samsung’s lawsuit came after Nvidia accused the Asian company and rival Qualcomm Inc of infringing patents on its graphics-processing unit (GPU). Nvidia vies with Qualcomm in the business of providing chips for smartphones and tablets. The U.S. chipmaker said in September that Qualcomm and Samsung had used Nvidia’s patented technologies without a license in Samsung’s mobile devices, including the just-launched Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge. “We’ll review and respond to these new claims against us, and look forward to presenting our case on how Nvidia GPU patents are being used without a license,” Nvidia said in a statement on Tuesday. Nvidia also pointed to a benchmarking study that supported its claim that the Tegra was the fastest mobile processor on the market.

386,QCOM,Little-known Taiwanese chip designer spawns low-priced smartphone boom,"TAIPEI, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Chips from Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc  were mostly passed over by the big phone brands a decade ago, with the likes of Nokia and Motorola commanding legions of in-house engineers who could advise on electronics and circuitry. Fast-forward to the age of the smartphone. The market is heaving with Chinese smartphone makers out to grab share from Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd with low-priced handsets. Sparking the boom in budget smartphones is MediaTek, now a $23 billion go-to chip designer favoured by margin-conscious phone makers. MediaTek pioneered bundling low-cost chips with recommendations on hardware such as lenses and speakers. This “system-on-chip” approach saves phone makers the cost of finding and testing parts to match the chips they buy. That in turn allows them to cut prices and, in the past year, seize 10 percentage points of market share from leader Samsung. Thanks in large part to system-on-chip, the average price of a smartphone should fall to $267 by 2018 from $314 now, showed data from researcher IDC. That compared with a U.S. starting price of $749 for the latest Apple iPhone 6 Plus. MediaTek says system-on-chip has won it the patronage of every phone brand bar Samsung and Apple. It helped low-priced smartphone maker Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd become the industry’s No.3 in just three years, and is tipped for similar success with Google Inc’s Android One in India. “You can think about MediaTek as having a franchise business model, like McDonald’s,” Chief Financial Officer David Ku told Reuters. “McDonald’s gives you all the equipment you need, and the initial cost for you is lower.” MediaTek’s system-on-chip strategy has helped the company’s market value rise 125 percent to T$715.8 billion ($23.39 billion) in less than three years. The strategy involves collaborating with almost 200 Chinese component makers and handset assemblers to supply MediaTek’s smartphone customers with parts compatible with its chips. MediaTek built up its supplier network in the feature phone era. At that time, it says, larger rivals sold chips to big phone makers which would employ thousands of engineers to find and test components such as screens for the chips to operate. “They weren’t really interested in doing business with MediaTek,” Ku said of phone makers. To differentiate, MediaTek began recommending hardware for its chips and targeting companies with limited means of sourcing and testing components independently. That lowered the barrier to enter the phone business, reduced costs and helped handsets reach the market quicker. “The smartphone ecosystem compared with the feature phone ecosystem is very similar, if not the same,” said Ku. “It’s all well-connected pipes. It doesn’t matter what product you pump in.” MediaTek adds reference designs to basic chip architecture, enabling components to work together. It contracts fabs - or chip factories - to make the chips, which it sells to phone makers along with a list of compatible sensors, microphones and other hardware. It is the list that saves customers money, helping them make smartphones more affordable - particularly in emerging markets such as China, which accounts for 70 to 80 percent of MediaTek sales. Thrifty handset buyers have helped MediaTek sales rise at least 40 percent each month this year, culminating in October’s 56 percent. For the full year, it estimates sales of 350 million smartphone “chipsets” from just 10 million in 2011. That would amount to 30 percent of the global market, showed Reuters calculations. Fubon Research analyst Carlos Peng estimated nearer 50 percent when excluding chipsets from the likes of Qualcomm Inc and Samsung that are primarily destined for high-priced smartphones. MediaTek’s sales spurt is largely due to “revolutionary” growth in the value of silicon per handset in function-heavy smartphones versus their far simpler feature phone predecessors, said analyst Rick Hsu at Daiwa Capital Markets in Taipei. “It was a virtually 100 percent increase in silicon value,” Hsu said. “It spurred demand for a lot of peripheral chips.” Growth is unlikely to be as marked in the ongoing transition to fourth-generation Long-Term Evolution (4G LTE) connectivity. MediaTek may even struggle with the emergence of 4G in China as it trails Qualcomm in the technology, analysts say. “The first couple of years of LTE could be very much like the early days of 3G (in 2008-2010), or when MediaTek had to play ‘catch-up’,” Yuanta Securities analyst George Chang wrote in a research note. That “usually leads to pricing erosion.”  ($1 = 30.5970 Taiwan dollar)   (Editing by Miyoung Kim and Christopher Cushing)",11162014,http://www.reuters.com/article/mediatek-mobilephone/little-known-taiwanese-chip-designer-spawns-low-priced-smartphone-boom-idUSL3N0T023Z20141116
387,QCOM,Qualcomm CEO more cautious on future revenue growth,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc on Wednesday gave a more conservative five-year outlook than in the past as it faces an antitrust probe in China and consumers there and in other developing countries buy lower-priced smartphones. China’s expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm’s opportunities have been clouded by a year-old antitrust investigation there and troubles collecting royalty payments from device makers. The company expects its revenue to rise 8 percent to 10 percent annually over the next five years and for earnings per share to grow faster than revenue. In the past, Qualcomm has had a five-year target of double-digit annual growth in earnings per share and revenue.  Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf told analysts at the company’s annual investor day that the troubles in China were hurting the QTL royalty business, which provides most of Qualcomm’s profits. “On QTL, the short story is that the underlying market continues to grow,” Mollenkopf said. “We are not participating in it right now to the degree we would like to, but once we resolve China, we think we’ll continue to grow in that area.” Mollenkopf also said Qualcomm was adapting its technology to develop processors for data centers, a market dominated by Intel Corp. Applied Micro Circuits recently introduced “microserver” chips based on ARM Holdings Plc technology that is widely used in smartphones, and Advanced Micro Devices is working on similar processors. “The high-end design point for high-end smartphones, the evolution of the laptop and tablet, really are starting to merge with what would be feasible to put into the data center,” Mollenkopf said. Qualcomm’s overall revenue rose 6.5 percent in fiscal 2014, far below growth rates of about 30 percent in recent years. Analysts expect 5 percent growth for 2015, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Also on Wednesday, Qualcomm said customers were testing its fifth-generation LTE modem chip, which has improved upload and download speeds, and that it would probably be commercially available next year. Qualcomm’s stock was down 1.7 percent at $70.79 in afternoon trading.

China’s expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm’s opportunities have been clouded by a year-old antitrust investigation there and troubles collecting royalty payments from device makers. The company expects its revenue to rise 8 percent to 10 percent annually over the next five years and for earnings per share to grow faster than revenue. In the past, Qualcomm has had a five-year target of double-digit annual growth in earnings per share and revenue. Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf told analysts at the company’s annual investor day that the troubles in China were hurting the QTL royalty business, which provides most of Qualcomm’s profits. “On QTL, the short story is that the underlying market continues to grow,” Mollenkopf said. “We are not participating in it right now to the degree we would like to, but once we resolve China, we think we’ll continue to grow in that area.” Mollenkopf also said Qualcomm was adapting its technology to develop processors for data centers, a market dominated by Intel Corp. Applied Micro Circuits recently introduced “microserver” chips based on ARM Holdings Plc technology that is widely used in smartphones, and Advanced Micro Devices  is working on similar processors. “The high-end design point for high-end smartphones, the evolution of the laptop and tablet, really are starting to merge with what would be feasible to put into the data center,” Mollenkopf said. Qualcomm’s overall revenue rose 6.5 percent in fiscal 2014, far below growth rates of about 30 percent in recent years. Analysts expect 5 percent growth for 2015, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Also on Wednesday, Qualcomm said customers were testing its fifth-generation LTE modem chip, which has improved upload and download speeds, and that it would probably be commercially available next year. Qualcomm’s stock was down 1.7 percent at $70.79 in afternoon trading.

393,QCOM,China Premier says Qualcomm's 'opportunities greater than challenges',"WUZHEN China (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc’s (QCOM.O) opportunities in China will be far greater than its challenges, Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday as the U.S. mobile chipmaker prepares to face a possible record fine for antitrust violations in the country.  Speaking at the World Internet Conference on Thursday with Qualcomm Executive Chairman Paul Jacobs, Li said he believed Qualcomm would resolve the issue with the Chinese authorities. He emphasized, however, the necessity for a “level playing field” for tech companies in China. The anti-monopoly regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), is investigating Qualcomm’s local subsidiary after it said in February the U.S. chipmaker was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards, allegations which could see it hit with record fines of more than $1 billion. Qualcomm’s Jacobs said the company was having “difficult discussions” with the regulator to find a “win-win solution”. Western business lobbies have criticized the Qualcomm investigation, along with a spate of recent antitrust probes into foreign companies in China, as part of a new wave of protectionism driven by the Chinese leadership. Chinese officials have said their investigations have targeted both domestic and foreign companies equally. Qualcomm earned 49 percent of its global revenue in China, or $12.29 billion for the year ended September 29.  In recent months, Qualcomm has sought to deepen its presence in China by transferring technology to domestic firms and investing in next-generation chipsets. In July, the San Diego-based company said it was partnering with Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (0981.HK), one of China’s biggest chipset makers, to manufacture Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors.

Analysts had expected more details on how Broadcom would return cash to shareholders after deciding in June to exit its money-losing cellular baseband chip business.  In a press release, Broadcom said it raised its 2015 quarterly dividend 17 percent to 14 cents per share, and it also announced a $1 billion stock buyback authorization for next year.

398,QCOM,"As Qualcomm decision looms, U.S. presses China on antitrust policy","BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama pressed China’s Xi Jinping during recent talks on the use of Chinese antitrust policy to limit royalty fees for foreign companies, an issue at the heart of a probe into U.S. mobile chipset maker Qualcomm Inc. The move by Obama to admonish China against applying its anti-monopoly law to benefit Chinese firms using foreign companies’ technology will be a key test of how much influence he can wield on these issues as Qualcomm’s case nears conclusion. “The United States government is concerned that China is using numerous mechanisms, including anti-monopoly law, to lower the value of foreign-owned patents and benefit Chinese firms employing foreign technology,” Patrick Ventrell, White House National Security Council spokesman told Reuters. “President Obama raised these concerns about the enforcement of China’s anti-monopoly law directly with President Xi when they met in Beijing last month.” At least 30 foreign firms, including San Diego-based Qualcomm, have come under the scrutiny of China’s 2008 anti-monopoly law, which some critics say is being used to unfairly target non-Chinese companies. China’s efforts to expand high-speed 4G networks is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm’s prospects have been hampered by the National Development and Reform Commission’s (NDRC) 13-month investigation into the firm. Two sources familiar with the discussions said Obama did not directly mention the company’s name, though Qualcomm is the only major ongoing antitrust case in China involving a U.S. company and royalty fees. An imminent decision in the case could force the company to pay fines potentially exceeding $1 billion and require concessions that would hurt its highly profitable business of charging licensing fees on phone chipsets that use its patents. It is unusual for specific commercial cases to be raised at the presidential level, underscoring the importance Washington places on China’s investigation. That the controversy over antitrust practices has been elevated to the level of presidential talks shows how the issue has become a centrepiece of commercial frictions between the world’s two largest economies. “I will not speculate on how the U.S. might react to any hypothetical outcome of a specific case,” Ventrell, from the White House, said. Obama’s comments to Xi mirrored those in a letter sent earlier this year by U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang, who is set to meet U.S. officials in Chicago this week to discuss commercial ties. The letter said using antitrust policy to lower royalty rates would not be in the interest of Chinese consumers or in the interest of the joint economic relationship, the sources said. Obama’s warnings on the royalties issue raise questions about how Washington will respond if the NDRC requires Qualcomm to significantly lower the rates that its Chinese customers pay to license its chipsets. “Having raised the issue directly with President Xi, and with his Treasury Secretary having taken the unprecedented step of raising a competition policy enforcement issue with his counterpart, President Obama’s credibility is now clearly at stake on this case,” said one of the sources on condition of anonymity. Leading international business lobbies have raised alarm over China’s antitrust investigations, including complaints they are motivated by Chinese industrial policy goals. China’s regulators have said their enforcement is fair and transparent. A Qualcomm settlement is likely to include the imposition of fines, a significant reduction of licensing fees the company charges Chinese handset manufacturers for phones sold domestically, and the termination of cross-licensing arrangements the company imposes on the manufacturers using its chipsets, according to people familiar with the case. Qualcomm earned about half of its global revenue of $26.5 billion in China for the fiscal year ended Sept. 28, with a large chunk of profit coming from higher-margin royalties earned from the company’s licensing arm. Analysts have said Chinese regulators are likely concerned about whether Qualcomm is licensing its chipset patents on a non-discriminatory basis. A Qualcomm representative declined to comment on the presidential talks. Kenneth Jarrett, President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai and a former U.S. diplomat, said some Americans might credit Obama for the effort, but there can be no guarantee his request will be received favourably. “Thus, for the U.S., there needs to be an assessment that presidential intervention will have a meaningful impact,” Jarrett told Reuters. “As for China’s leaders, if there is no consequence to ignoring the request, they might take that as a sign of presidential weakness,” Jarrett said.",12162014,http://www.reuters.com/article/qualcomm-china-antitrust/as-qualcomm-decision-looms-u-s-presses-china-on-antitrust-policy-idUSL1N0U00LH20141216

The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the country’s anti-monopoly regulator which launched a probe of the San Diego-based company 13 months ago, said the case would be settled lawfully, according to an online statement. The notice cited Xu Kunlin, director general of NDRC’s anti-monopoly bureau. The NDRC also said it had completed its seventh round of discussions with Qualcomm President Derek Aberle and his team earlier this month. Qualcomm will continue to cooperate with the regulator to reach a settlement, the NDRC statement said. A company spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment. The regulator provided no indication as to when discussions with the U.S. chipmaker would resume. The NDRC said in February that Qualcomm was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards. An imminent decision in the case is expected to force the company to pay fines potentially exceeding $1 billion and require concessions that would hurt its highly profitable business of charging licensing fees on phone chipsets that use its patents.

The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the country’s anti-monopoly regulator which launched a probe of the San Diego-based company 13 months ago, said the case would be settled lawfully, according to an online statement. The notice cited Xu Kunlin, director general of NDRC’s anti-monopoly bureau. The NDRC also said it had completed its seventh round of discussions with Qualcomm President Derek Aberle and his team earlier this month. Qualcomm will continue to cooperate with the regulator to reach a settlement, the NDRC statement said. A company spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment. The regulator provided no indication as to when discussions with the U.S. chipmaker would resume. The NDRC said in February that Qualcomm was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards. An imminent decision in the case is expected to force the company to pay fines potentially exceeding $1 billion and require concessions that would hurt its highly profitable business of charging licensing fees on phone chipsets that use its patents. The NDRC said in August that Qualcomm had expressed its willingness to improve and correct pricing issues. At least 30 foreign firms, including Qualcomm, have come under the scrutiny of China’s 2008 anti-monopoly law, which some critics say is being used to unfairly target non-Chinese companies. U.S. President Barack Obama pressed his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping during talks in November on the use of Chinese antitrust policy to limit royalty fees for foreign companies. While Western business lobbies had criticized China’s use of its antitrust law earlier this year, the elevation of the controversy to the level of presidential talks indicated that it had become a centerpiece of commercial friction between the world’s two largest economies. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told Qualcomm Executive Chairman Paul Jacobs last month that opportunities in China remained far greater than the challenges, in a meeting on the sidelines of the World Internet Conference.

406,QCOM,"For Qualcomm, China settlement may be just the beginning","SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING (Reuters) - The settlement of China’s antitrust probe into Qualcomm Inc is likely to intensify global scrutiny of the firm’s highly profitable patent licensing business, and may even call into question its worldwide contracts with smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung. China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is moving to wrap up its 13-month investigation into the U.S. chipmaker as soon as possible, the regulator said in a statement on Friday, bringing to an end one of the most high profile of a slew of such investigations by Beijing into western firms. Any deal is likely to include a record-breaking fine, as well as changes to how Qualcomm licenses its technology to handset makers in China, according to industry sources and local press reports. That could weaken the firm’s prized technology-licensing business across the global smartphone industry by increasing pressure from regulators in other countries. Anti-trust probes in Europe and by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may be related to China’s investigation, Qualcomm has said. “It’s not an overstatement to say they’re under attack,” said Thomas Cotter, a patent expert and professor at the University of Minnesota Law School. “Nobody knows how it will play out but the fact that there is an FTC investigation tells you something.” Qualcomm declined to comment. Qualcomm is the top patent holder for cellphone technology, including many that form industry standards like CDMA and LTE. Charging royalties based on the cellphones’ selling prices, even those made with competitors’ chips, provided more than half of its $8 billion net income in 2014. As growth tapers in developed markets, the smartphone industry has turned to China, where the rollout of LTE technology is driving demand, and where the majority of the world’s smartphones are also manufactured. The NDRC, one of China’s anti-trust regulators, has said it suspects Qualcomm of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards. Qualcomm is expected by industry sources to agree to changes in how it charges royalties on cellphones sold in China, which will hurt its bottom line in its fastest-growing and most significant market. Qualcomm earned about half of its global revenue of $26.5 billion in China for the fiscal year ended Sept. 28. An agreement to lower royalty rates charged by Qualcomm on phones sold in China could affect its contractual relationships not just with local manufacturers such as Huawei, Lenovo, ZTE and Xiaomi Inc, but also with bigger global players that make and sell phones in China, such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics, said patent lawyers consulted by Reuters. At a meeting with analysts in November, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle did not directly answer a question about when the chipmaker’s largest licensees’ contracts would be due for renegotiation, or how those renegotiations would be affected by potential concessions Qualcomm could make in China. “If Qualcomm comes to an agreement with China’s government to materially reduce its royalty rates, then what happens with their agreements with LG, Samsung and Apple?” said Ascendiant Capital analyst Cody Acree. “It becomes a snowball that’s really hard to see the end to.” The China probe is the latest anti-trust investigation faced by Qualcomm, which was hit with a $20 million fine in South Korea in 2009 and was forced to renegotiate licensing agreements with Nokia and others by the European Commission in 2007. Recent decisions by Supreme Court judges making it harder to enforce software patents, as well as the possibility of a renewed push in Washington for patent reform, now have the San Diego company on the defensive at home, some patent experts believe. The FTC’s probe concerns patents on technology used in industry standards and might require Qualcomm to change its licensing practices, according to a company filing. “Qualcomm has more problems than just in China,” said Donald Merino, who advises companies on patents in Asia. “They have a problem in the US as well because the U.S. is devaluing the patent system.”",12292014,http://www.reuters.com/article/china-qualcomm/for-qualcomm-china-settlement-may-be-just-the-beginning-idUSL1N0UD0ES20141229

The constellation, which is will cost between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, is intended to provide high-speed Internet and telephone services worldwide. OneWeb’s spacecraft will weigh less than 300 pounds (136 kg) and be positioned in orbits roughly 750 miles (1,207 km) above the Earth. The company already has been allotted use of a part of the radio spectrum for Internet services. “The OneWeb system will extend the networks of mobile operators globally, enabling them to provide coverage to rural and remote areas,” the company said in a statement. OneWeb intends to partner with local operators to provide Internet access. “Imagine the possibilities for the 3 billion people in hard to reach areas who are currently not connected,” Branson said in a statement. “We are pleased to join Virgin as an initial investor, and we look forward to helping fund initial technical feasibility work for the satellite system,” added Qualcomm Executive Chairman Paul Jacobs. Wyler declined to disclose how much London-based Virgin and California-based Qualcomm are investing in OneWeb. Branson and Jacobs will join OneWeb’s board of directors.

The San Diego, California, company also warned that “challenges” with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China, where Qualcomm has been disappointed with growth that has fallen short of expectations. The chipmaker said in a statement on Wednesday it expects fiscal 2015 revenue between $26.0 billion and $28.0 billion, down from a previous estimate of between $26.8 billion and $28.8 billion. It now expects non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2015 between $4.75 and $5.05, compared to a previous range of $5.05 to $5.35. Top smartphone maker Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) decided not to use the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor for its next flagship Galaxy S smartphone after the chip overheated during testing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. Samsung had declined to comment on the report.   Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf told analysts on a conference call that the Snapdragon 810 performed well and is on track to be used in 60 devices. Samsung designs and makes its own line of smartphone processors, the Exynos, but the Korean company in the past has depended on Qualcomm’s chips for many of its smartphones. “Qualcomm has a lot of market share but they have some customers with scale to do their own silicon, and it looks like that’s happening,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. “This may be a trend.” Qualcomm said “product challenges” with a chip in China have created an opening for smaller competitors. “We have already addressed many of the initial product challenges in order to support early customer device launches in these tiers and are continuing to further enhance the performance of this chip,” Mollenkopf said. China’s expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm’s opportunities have been clouded by a year-old antitrust investigation there and troubles collecting royalty payments from device makers. The company said it resolved a dispute with a major licensee in China but that the timing and impact of a resolution of the National Development and Reform Commission’s (NDRC) investigation remain uncertain.

The S&P; 500 hit a session high in the afternoon when nine out of 10 of the index’s sectors turned positive. It had fallen as much as 0.65 percent earlier. The confluence of low oil prices and a strong dollar, which is hurting some companies, is distracting investors from what is actually an average earnings season, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. “This is the first time we’ve had a quarter we’ve had to deal with both dynamics in this business cycle,” said Hogan.    “We’re looking at the big household names that put out disappointing numbers this week and we’re putting undue influence on that.” Shares in Chinese internet giant Alibaba Group  dropped 9 percent to $89.46 after revenue missed expectations, which also pushed down shares in part-owner Yahoo. “The growth story of China is called into question” by the Alibaba results, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

Supporting stocks, data showed weekly applications for unemployment insurance fell to their lowest in almost 15 years, adding to bullish signals on the labor market. Investors also continued to digest Wednesday’s Federal Reserve statement, which reiterated confidence in the U.S. economy but referred to international developments, making some investors worry that rates could rise later than expected. “The clearer the Fed wants to be the more it spooks the markets,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark. “The statement yesterday was confusing for markets. They (the Fed) put sentences in there for everyone.” Coach Inc shares rose 6 percent to $38.71 after the handbag maker posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit.

424,QCOM,Qualcomm to pay $975 million to resolve China antitrust dispute,"SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) has agreed to pay China a fine of $975 million, the largest in the country’s corporate history, ending a 14-month government investigation into anti-competitive practices. The deal also requires Qualcomm to lower its royalty rates on patents used in China, likely helping Chinese smartphone makers like Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd [XTC.UL] and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. It removes a major source of concern among Qualcomm investors, sending shares of the U.S. chipmaker up 1.6 percent to $68.18 in after-hours trading.     China’s expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm’s opportunities have been clouded by the antitrust investigation, which has also contributed to troubles collecting royalty payments from device makers. Qualcomm said in a statement on Monday it would not contest the China’s National Development and Reform Commission’s (NDRC) finding that Qualcomm violated an antitrust law.  Asked whether the resolution in China could affect the outcome of ongoing antitrust probes into Qualcomm in Europe and the United States, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said, “We fully respect their authority, but we don’t believe it’s likely that other agencies will necessarily meet similar conclusions.”The U.S. chipmaker also cut its full-year earnings estimate because of the fine, which Qualcomm said would cost it about 58 cents per share, but it raised the lower end of its revenue forecast slightly.  “It removes a significant source of uncertainly from our business and really positions our licensing group to really participate in the full growth of the wireless market in China,” Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf told Reuters in a phone interview. “It’s something we’re happy is over.” Discussions in Beijing over one of the most contentious cases under China’s 2008 anti-monopoly law had intensified in recent weeks, culminating in meetings between Qualcomm senior executives and the NDRC on Friday.  Under the terms of the agreement, Qualcomm will offer licenses to its current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents - widely used by Chinese device makers - separately from other patents.  For companies opting for the new agreement, which applies to phones sold for use in China, Qualcomm will calculate royalties based on 65 percent of the selling price of phones, instead of on the whole price.  Some on Wall Street have speculated that even limited concessions made to Qualcomm’s licensing business in China could affect the technology company’s licensing deals in other countries. “That’s the first time I’ve ever seen them in writing agree to that and it begs the question of why 65 percent is the right number in China and it’s not the right number everywhere,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. As a result of the fine, Qualcomm said it now expects full-year earnings per share of between $3.56 and $3.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with its prior forecast of $4.04 to $4.34. It raised its fiscal 2015 revenue forecast to a range of $26.3 billion to $28 billion, slightly raising the lower end of its last forecast of $26 billion to $28 billion.  Excluding the cost of the fine and other one-time items, Qualcomm forecast earnings of $4.85 to $5.05 per share, raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $4.75 to $5.05. On that basis, analysts had expected $4.96 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

429,QCOM,"Amid mobile slump, Samsung needs more outside customers for its chips and panels","SEOUL (Reuters) - As Samsung Electronics Co Ltd sells fewer of its own smartphones, the South Korean group’s components businesses are under pressure to pick up the slack and secure external customers for chips and display panels, including putting these in rival mobile devices.  Samsung Display has begun supplying organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels to Chinese smartphone makers Lenovo, Coolpad, Oppo Electronics and Vivo Electronics. And the subsidiary says it’s on the lookout for more clients, aiming to have half its total revenue by 2017 from sales to outside customers, up from just over a third in 2013. Industry officials estimate that external clients account for around a fifth of Samsung Display’s sales of smaller smartphone and tablet panels compared to about 50 percent for large panels for TVs, underscoring a need for more mobile clients. “Samsung Display’s desire to grow overseas sales wasn’t as strong when Samsung Electronics’ Galaxy S devices were selling well, but now it’s trying to avoid being too over-reliant on a single client,” a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  Samsung’s systems chips business is also trying to grow its customer base following a weak 2014. Some analysts say the business lost more than $1 billion last year on declining sales of Galaxy smartphones and the loss of a contract to supply the processor for Apple Inc’s iPhone 6. Samsung’s next Galaxy S smartphone is widely expected to be powered by its own Exynos processor chips after Qualcomm Inc acknowledged that a key customer won’t use its Snapdragon mobile chip in a flagship device.   Samsung has declined to comment on that, but another individual familiar with the matter said the proportion of next-generation Galaxy S phones powered by Exynos chips will likely increase from previous versions.   A successful launch of the new device could help win more external orders, and bolster profits. Samsung said late last month it was in talks with third-party customers about supplying its Exynos mobile processors.   “Some of Samsung’s components businesses and other affiliates were too dependent on the captive (in-house) market,” said IM Investment analyst Lee Min-hee. “There’s been a general shift in direction, with the businesses looking to make external sales and diversify the customer base.”  Samsung’s mobile profits for October-December dropped 64 percent from a year earlier, as Galaxy S5 sales disappointed and rivals like China’s Xiaomi Inc [XTC.UL] became increasingly competitive. Analysts don’t expect any smartphone turnaround as margins remain squeezed.   Nomura and other brokerages, though, have raised their 2015 earnings forecasts for Samsung, betting on improved contributions from component sales. As smartphone competition heats up, Samsung should benefit from better demand for components such as chips and panels. The system chip business in particular is expected to be a catalyst. Local media reports and analysts say Samsung is likely to win back the Apple contract and supply the majority of mobile processors for the next iPhone. Display sales, too, should provide an additional boost this year as the business expands its external customer base. Daewoo Securities tips 2015 operating profit to more than double to 1.7 trillion won ($1.55 billion) from last year. “We’re starting to hear talk that Samsung’s annual profit could actually increase this year, contrary to the market consensus before the fourth-quarter results were announced, and I think that will be the case as well,” said Park Jung-hoon, a fund manager at HDC Asset Management, which holds Samsung shares.

Samsung said late last month it was in talks with third-party customers about supplying its Exynos mobile processors. “Some of Samsung’s components businesses and other affiliates were too dependent on the captive (in-house) market,” said IM Investment analyst Lee Min-hee. “There’s been a general shift in direction, with the businesses looking to make external sales and diversify the customer base.” Samsung’s mobile profits for October-December dropped 64 percent from a year earlier, as Galaxy S5 sales disappointed and rivals like China’s Xiaomi Inc became increasingly competitive. Analysts don’t expect any smartphone turnaround as margins remain squeezed. Nomura and other brokerages, though, have raised their 2015 earnings forecasts for Samsung, betting on improved contributions from component sales. As smartphone competition heats up, Samsung should benefit from better demand for components such as chips and panels. The system chip business in particular is expected to be a catalyst. Local media reports and analysts say Samsung is likely to win back the Apple contract and supply the majority of mobile processors for the next iPhone. Display sales, too, should provide an additional boost this year as the business expands its external customer base.

434,QCOM,"With antitrust deal done, Qualcomm still faces China challenges","SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING (Reuters) - Even after agreeing to pay a record near-$1 billion fine in China for antitrust violations,  U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc faces big challenges in its most important market. As low-cost, low-margin Chinese smartphone manufacturers such as Xiaomi Inc and Huawei Technologies  push into other developing markets, they are driving down average handset prices - bad news for San Diego-based Qualcomm, which collects royalties based on the handset’s value. Qualcomm could see its margins slip, eroding its profits, as firms like Xiaomi and Huawei push their budget devices into markets such as India and Latin America. “You’ve got all these Chinese companies - like Xiaomi, Huawei and Lenovo - that want to go global and take share from Samsung Electronics, HTC and presumably even Apple, but they’re going to do it at much lower price points,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. While sales of high-end devices like Apple’s iPhone remain robust - and generate hefty profits for Qualcomm - the average selling prices for smartphones in developing countries will fall to $102 by 2018 from $135 last year, predicts IDC. In the United States, smartphones often sell for more than $600 without a contract. Qualcomm, a long-time leader in wireless chip technology, is also under increasing competition from Taiwan’s MediaTek  and a handful of small Chinese chipmakers that specialize in making chips for low-priced phones. Qualcomm has led the industry with LTE technology, giving it a major advantage in the recent roll-out of the advanced technology in China. But Intel, Marvell, MediaTek and HiSilicon, a unit of Huawei, are making inroads. In the second quarter of last year, Qualcomm’s global share of LTE baseband chips dipped to 89 percent from 95 percent a year before, lshihargely due to the success of emerging Chinese competitors, said StrategyAnalytics analyst Sravan Kundojjala. Last month, Qualcomm cut its annual revenue outlook partly because a major customer - reported to be Samsung - chose not to use Qualcomm’s newest processor in its next top-tier phone. Qualcomm also said it expected increased competition in China in medium and high-end devices, a part of the market it has traditionally dominated. Huawei, which sold about 75 million handsets in 2014, uses its own HiSilicon processor for its flagship Ascend models.

435,QCOM,Qualcomm to pay $975 mln to resolve China antitrust dispute,"SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc has agreed to pay a fine of $975 million, the largest in China’s corporate history, ending a 14-month government investigation into anti-competitive practices. The deal - the details of which were first reported by Reuters on Monday - also requires Qualcomm to lower its royalty rates on patents used in China, likely helping local smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. Qualcomm said the agreement removes a major source of concern for its investors, sending shares of the San Diego-based chipmaker up 2.8 percent to $69 in after-hours trading. China’s expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm’s opportunities have been clouded by the antitrust probe, which has also contributed to problems in collecting royalty payments from device makers. Qualcomm said in a statement on Monday it would not contest the National Development and Reform Commission’s (NDRC) finding that it violated an antitrust law. Asked whether the resolution in China could affect the outcome of ongoing antitrust probes into Qualcomm in Europe and the United States, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said, “We fully respect their authority, but we don’t believe it’s likely that other agencies will necessarily meet similar conclusions.” The U.S. firm cut its full-year earnings estimate, putting the cost of the fine at about 58 cents per share, but it raised the lower end of its revenue forecast slightly. “It removes a significant source of uncertainly from our business and positions our licensing group to really participate in the full growth of the wireless market in China,” CEO Steve Mollenkopf said in a phone interview. “It’s something we’re happy is over.” Discussions in Beijing over one of the most contentious cases under China’s 2008 anti-monopoly law had intensified in recent weeks, culminating in meetings between Qualcomm senior executives and the NDRC on Friday. Xu Kunlin, head of the NDRC’s anti-monopoly bureau, said the $975 million fine - equal to 8 percent of Qualcomm’s 2013 sales in China - was less than the 10 percent of sales maximum allowed under Chinese law because Qualcomm fully cooperated with investigators. “Issuing the fine was not our primary purpose,” Xu told reporters on Tuesday, according to a Sina.com live-blog of his remarks. “Our purpose was to restore orderly, free-market competition. Qualcomm’s practices had stifled innovation.” Under the terms of the agreement, Qualcomm will offer licenses to its current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents, widely used by Chinese device makers, separately from other patents. For companies opting for the new agreement, which applies to phones sold for use in China, Qualcomm will calculate royalties based on 65 percent of the phone’s selling price, instead of on the whole price. Some on Wall Street have speculated that even limited concessions made to Qualcomm’s licensing business in China could affect the technology company’s licensing deals elsewhere. “That’s the first time I’ve ever seen them in writing agree to that and it begs the question of why 65 percent is the right number in China and it’s not the right number everywhere,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. As a result of the fine, Qualcomm said it now expects full-year earnings per share of $3.56-$3.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with a prior forecast of $4.04-$4.34. It raised its fiscal 2015 revenue forecast to $26.3-$28 billion, slightly raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $26-$28 billion. Excluding the cost of the fine and other one-time items, Qualcomm forecast earnings of $4.85-$5.05 per share, raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $4.75-$5.05. On that basis, analysts had expected $4.96 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Qualcomm is one of several overseas companies, including Microsoft Corp, to come under investigation in China for allegedly anti-competitive practises.

436,QCOM,Breakingviews: China pulls its punches with Qualcomm settlement,"HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China has held back with its Qualcomm settlement. The country’s antitrust watchdogs hit the U.S. chipmaker with a $975 million fine on Feb. 9 and forced it to lower patent fees. That’s helpful for local smartphone makers that rely on Qualcomm’s third and fourth generation mobile technology. Yet the resolution stopped short of explicitly curbing the tech giant’s dominance in the country. Big as China is, it can’t yet afford to shut out foreign technology. The one-off fine may be the largest in China’s corporate history, but the $117 billion tech group can afford to take the hit: Qualcomm is debt-free and held $32 billion worth of cash and securities at the end of December. But Beijing’s order for Qualcomm to price its royalties based on 65 percent of the selling price of a phone, rather than the whole price, will leave a bruise. Assuming 30 percent of the company’s China revenue in the last fiscal year comes from patents - in line with Qualcomm’s global ratio - a 35 percent reduction in royalties collected would have slashed the group’s revenue last year by $1.4 billion. Yet China’s antitrust watchdogs have left some leeway for Qualcomm to play tough with its customers. Unlike in Japan or South Korea, Beijing did not explicitly ban the company from “cross-licensing” - where Qualcomm requires clients to make their patents freely available to the chipmaker and its other customers - or from bundling chip sales with license agreements. Rather, Qualcomm has committed to negotiating with Chinese companies “in good faith”. The lack of detail raises the risk Chinese regulators will flex their interpretation of “good faith”, but there’s scope for Qualcomm to retain its dominance and market share. A likely explanation for the relative lenience is China’s reliance on foreign technology. The country has been aggressively ramping up next generation mobile networks: shipments of 4G smartphones in China will hit 422 million by 2017, up from 152 million last year according to IDC. But more than 90 percent of chips are imported, which means even more reliance on foreign companies for expanding 4G networks. Beijing’s regulators may have a lot of weight, but Qualcomm is still very much in the game. - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm announced that it has reached a resolution with China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) on Feb. 9, ending a 14-month investigation into anti-competitive practices. The NDRC is China’s top economic planning body and also regulates prices and market dominance under China’s anti-monopoly law. - Under the agreement, Qualcomm will pay China a fine of $975 million for violating China’s anti-monopoly law and modify some of its business practices in a “rectification plan”. Specifically, the company will change the way it charges royalties from smartphone manufacturers for its third and fourth generation cellular technology. Qualcomm has also committed to negotiating its licensing and chip sales agreements with Chinese manufacturers fairly and reasonably. - Qualcomm raised its forecast revenue for fiscal 2015 to a range of $26.3 billion to $28 billion, slightly raising the lower end of its last forecast of $26 billion to $28 billion, as a result of the agreement. - Qualcomm reported revenue of $7.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, a 7 percent increase from the same period last year on Jan. 29.

439,QCOM,"Amid mobile slump, Samsung needs more outside customers for chips, panels","SEOUL (Reuters) - As Samsung Electronics Co Ltd sells fewer of its own smartphones, the South Korean group’s components businesses are under pressure to pick up the slack and secure external customers for chips and display panels, including putting these in rival mobile devices.  Samsung Display has begun supplying organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels to Chinese smartphone makers Lenovo, Coolpad, Oppo Electronics and Vivo Electronics. And the subsidiary says it’s on the lookout for more clients, aiming to have half its total revenue by 2017 from sales to outside customers, up from just over a third in 2013. Industry officials estimate that external clients account for around a fifth of Samsung Display’s sales of smaller smartphone and tablet panels compared to about 50 percent for large panels for TVs, underscoring a need for more mobile clients. “Samsung Display’s desire to grow overseas sales wasn’t as strong when Samsung Electronics’ Galaxy S devices were selling well, but now it’s trying to avoid being too over-reliant on a single client,” a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  Samsung’s systems chips business is also trying to grow its customer base following a weak 2014. Some analysts say the business lost more than $1 billion last year on declining sales of Galaxy smartphones and the loss of a contract to supply the processor for Apple Inc’s iPhone 6. Samsung’s next Galaxy S smartphone is widely expected to be powered by its own Exynos processor chips after Qualcomm Inc acknowledged that a key customer won’t use its Snapdragon mobile chip in a flagship device. Samsung has declined to comment on that, but another individual familiar with the matter said the proportion of next-generation Galaxy S phones powered by Exynos chips will likely increase from previous versions.   A successful launch of the new device could help win more external orders, and bolster profits. Samsung said late last month it was in talks with third-party customers about supplying its Exynos mobile processors. “Some of Samsung’s components businesses and other affiliates were too dependent on the captive (in-house) market,” said IM Investment analyst Lee Min-hee. “There’s been a general shift in direction, with the businesses looking to make external sales and diversify the customer base.”  Samsung’s mobile profits for October-December dropped 64 percent from a year earlier, as Galaxy S5 sales disappointed and rivals like China’s Xiaomi Inc [XTC.UL] became increasingly competitive. Analysts don’t expect any smartphone turnaround as margins remain squeezed. Nomura and other brokerages, though, have raised their 2015 earnings forecasts for Samsung, betting on improved contributions from component sales. As smartphone competition heats up, Samsung should benefit from better demand for components such as chips and panels. The system chip business in particular is expected to be a catalyst.

440,QCOM,"UPDATE 1-Amid mobile slump, Samsung needs more outside customers for chips, panels","(Adds link to TV clip) By Se Young Lee SEOUL, Feb 10 (Reuters) - As Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  sells fewer of its own smartphones, the South Korean group’s components businesses are under pressure to pick up the slack and secure external customers for chips and display panels, including putting these in rival mobile devices. Samsung Display has begun supplying organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels to Chinese smartphone makers Lenovo , Coolpad, Oppo Electronics and Vivo Electronics. And the subsidiary says it’s on the lookout for more clients, aiming to have half its total revenue by 2017 from sales to outside customers, up from just over a third in 2013. Industry officials estimate that external clients account for around a fifth of Samsung Display’s sales of smaller smartphone and tablet panels compared to about 50 percent for large panels for TVs, underscoring a need for more mobile clients. “Samsung Display’s desire to grow overseas sales wasn’t as strong when Samsung Electronics’ Galaxy S devices were selling well, but now it’s trying to avoid being too over-reliant on a single client,” a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Samsung’s systems chips business is also trying to grow its customer base following a weak 2014. Some analysts say the business lost more than $1 billion last year on declining sales of Galaxy smartphones and the loss of a contract to supply the processor for Apple Inc’s iPhone 6. Samsung’s next Galaxy S smartphone is widely expected to be powered by its own Exynos processor chips after Qualcomm Inc  acknowledged that a key customer won’t use its Snapdragon mobile chip in a flagship device. Samsung has declined to comment on that, but another individual familiar with the matter said the proportion of next-generation Galaxy S phones powered by Exynos chips will likely increase from previous versions. A successful launch of the new device could help win more external orders, and bolster profits. Samsung said late last month it was in talks with third-party customers about supplying its Exynos mobile processors. “Some of Samsung’s components businesses and other affiliates were too dependent on the captive (in-house) market,” said IM Investment analyst Lee Min-hee. “There’s been a general shift in direction, with the businesses looking to make external sales and diversify the customer base.” Samsung’s mobile profits for October-December dropped 64 percent from a year earlier, as Galaxy S5 sales disappointed and rivals like China’s Xiaomi Inc became increasingly competitive. Analysts don’t expect any smartphone turnaround as margins remain squeezed. Nomura and other brokerages, though, have raised their 2015 earnings forecasts for Samsung, betting on improved contributions from component sales. As smartphone competition heats up, Samsung should benefit from better demand for components such as chips and panels. The system chip business in particular is expected to be a catalyst. Local media reports and analysts say Samsung is likely to win back the Apple contract and supply the majority of mobile processors for the next iPhone. Display sales, too, should provide an additional boost this year as the business expands its external customer base.

441,QCOM,Qualcomm to pay $975 million to resolve China antitrust dispute,"SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc has agreed to pay a fine of $975 million, the largest in China’s corporate history, ending a 14-month government investigation into anti-competitive practices. The deal - the details of which were first reported by Reuters on Monday - also requires Qualcomm to lower its royalty rates on patents used in China, likely helping local smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd [XTC.UL] and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL].  Qualcomm said the agreement removes a major source of concern for its investors, sending shares of the San Diego-based chipmaker up 2.8 percent to $69 in after-hours trading. China’s expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm’s opportunities have been clouded by the antitrust probe, which has also contributed to problems in collecting royalty payments from device makers. Qualcomm said in a statement on Monday it would not contest the National Development and Reform Commission’s (NDRC) finding that it violated an antitrust law.  Asked whether the resolution in China could affect the outcome of ongoing antitrust probes into Qualcomm in Europe and the United States, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said, “We fully respect their authority, but we don’t believe it’s likely that other agencies will necessarily meet similar conclusions.” The U.S. firm cut its full-year earnings estimate, putting the cost of the fine at about 58 cents per share, but it raised the lower end of its revenue forecast slightly. “It removes a significant source of uncertainly from our business and positions our licensing group to really participate in the full growth of the wireless market in China,” CEO Steve Mollenkopf said in a phone interview. “It’s something we’re happy is over.” Discussions in Beijing over one of the most contentious cases under China’s 2008 anti-monopoly law had intensified in recent weeks, culminating in meetings between Qualcomm senior executives and the NDRC on Friday. Xu Kunlin, head of the NDRC’s anti-monopoly bureau, said the $975 million fine - equal to 8 percent of Qualcomm’s 2013 sales in China - was less than the 10 percent of sales maximum allowed under Chinese law because Qualcomm fully cooperated with investigators. “Issuing the fine was not our primary purpose,” Xu told reporters on Tuesday, according to a Sina.com live-blog of his remarks. “Our purpose was to restore orderly, free-market competition. Qualcomm’s practices had stifled innovation.” Under the terms of the agreement, Qualcomm will offer licenses to its current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents, widely used by Chinese device makers, separately from other patents. For companies opting for the new agreement, which applies to phones sold for use in China, Qualcomm will calculate royalties based on 65 percent of the phone’s selling price, instead of on the whole price.  Some on Wall Street have speculated that even limited concessions made to Qualcomm’s licensing business in China could affect the technology company’s licensing deals elsewhere. “That’s the first time I’ve ever seen them in writing agree to that and it begs the question of why 65 percent is the right number in China and it’s not the right number everywhere,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. As a result of the fine, Qualcomm said it now expects full-year earnings per share of $3.56-$3.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with a prior forecast of $4.04-$4.34. It raised its fiscal 2015 revenue forecast to $26.3-$28 billion, slightly raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $26-$28 billion. Excluding the cost of the fine and other one-time items, Qualcomm forecast earnings of $4.85-$5.05 per share, raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $4.75-$5.05. On that basis, analysts had expected $4.96 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Qualcomm is one of several overseas companies, including Microsoft Corp, to come under investigation in China for allegedly anti-competitive practises.

The People’s Bank of China made clear on Tuesday it was ready to fight any downturn in the world’s second-largest economy, but added it would avoid “pumping out” too much cash. The comments reinforced expectations that more policy easing is on the cards. Such a view has helped fuel a stock market surge of nearly 30 percent in the last few months, though the rally has shown signs of flagging in recent weeks as more firms issue profit warnings. “We’re seeing a technical rebound as expectations of further policy support help stabilise the market,” said Shen Zhengyang, analyst at Northeast Securities. “But we don’t see fresh capital flowing in as the market doesn’t guarantee red envelopes ahead of the Lunar New Year,” he added, referring to the customary gifts of cash in red packets for the holiday. The CSI300 index ended the morning session up 0.6 percent at 3,426.22 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index  was up 0.2 percent. But Hong Kong shares fell, with the Hang Seng index  down 0.8 percent and the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index  marginally weaker. Trading volumes in Shanghai remained thin, after hitting a fresh three-month low on Tuesday, as many investors await clues on whether the economy is bottoming out. Although the market expects fresh monetary easing measures  - China International Capital Corp forecast another interest rate reduction and three reserve ratio cuts ahead - analysts said they are aimed at bolstering the economy, rather than the stock market. In a sign of waning interest in stocks, the number of new trading accounts opened last week totalled 384,800, down nearly 20 percent from the previous week, according to the China Securities Journal. Software and telecom stocks climbed on Wednesday, as investors bet the $1 billion anti-trust fine China slapped on U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc would benefit domestic rivals.

The person, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, declined to elaborate further. South Korea’s Maeil Business newspaper, without citing direct sources, reported that the commission will look into whether Qualcomm is abusing its dominant market position. As part of its investigation, the commission plans to send inquiries to domestic smartphone makers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd as well as Qualcomm competitors like Intel Corp, the newspaper said.  Qualcomm, the Fair Trade Commission and Samsung Electronics  declined to comment. Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Qualcomm is also dealing with antitrust probes in Europe and the United States. In their investigation of Qualcomm, Chinese antitrust officials had met with their South Korean counterparts, Reuters reported in August.

446,QCOM,Qualcomm deal sparks China smartphone patent skirmishes,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Last summer, lawyers from Chinese telecoms gear maker ZTE Corp began writing to half a dozen local handset makers it believed used its patents. Its message was simple: it’s time to pay up. ZTE’s efforts to collect patent royalties - months ahead of Qualcomm Inc’s China antitrust settlement this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter - shows how that deal has already changed the way China’s booming smartphone industry does business. As anticipated by ZTE, a key term in the settlement dissolved Qualcomm’s cross-licensing agreements in China that had given smaller Qualcomm customers free access to the patent portfolios of more established Qualcomm customers. The settlement has allowed wireless patent holders like ZTE and Huawei Technologies to seek royalties, while introducing a new risk of litigation to China’s younger handset industry at a time when domestic patent law is gaining traction. “For the first time, the settlement is forcing domestic manufacturers to recognize the value of IP (intellectual property) and consider how to use it strategically, which companies do in the West,” said Wang Yanhui, secretary general of the Mobile China Alliance, an industry consortium. “That’s the real significance of the (Qualcomm) settlement.” The competitive dynamics are particularly complex in China, the world’s biggest smartphone manufacturer and consumer, as large Chinese telecom equipment makers that hold many essential patents for wireless technology also compete in the phone market against younger, nimbler manufacturers. The settlement could prove tricky for companies like Xiaomi Inc, a 4-year-old Beijing-based smartphone maker whose weak patent position has proved a major vulnerability. In December, a court in India temporarily halted its shipments there after Swedish telecom firm Ericsson complained Xiaomi had not been paying its royalties. Although Xiaomi has been reported by Chinese media to be one of the handset makers now targeted by ZTE’s lawyers, both companies declined to discuss the issue. But in response to questions from Reuters, Bin Lin, Xiaomi’s president, said he expects Xiaomi to only attract more patent threats and litigation from rivals in the future, as does any young firm that enjoys explosive growth. “This is true of any company, not just Chinese companies,” Bin said, adding Xiaomi filed 2,000 patents last year and hopes to apply for double that number this year. “We’ve been focusing on building up our own IP. It’s going to take some time.” ZTE declined to discuss its patent negotiations with other firms, but said in a statement, echoed separately by Huawei, that the Qualcomm settlement “is positive for the development and protection of intellectual property rights in China, and will help promote fair competition for technology innovators.” Between 2007-13, ZTE and Huawei filed for nearly 34,000 patents each, Thomson Reuters data show. The two Shenzhen-based companies have applied for more international patents than the rest of the top-10 Chinese companies combined, and their filing activity dwarfs that of leading Internet firms Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Seeing big gains through enforcing its patent rights, ZTE executives recently directed a major U.S. shareholder to consult industry analysts about the positive financial impact of chasing royalties, said an individual with knowledge of the matter. “They’re taking this extremely seriously,” said the person, who requested anonymity to speak about a private issue. Other observers said legal jostling will intensify, but there will not likely be an immediate eruption of high-profile court battles. “It would be extremely costly and messy for ZTE to take Xiaomi to court, especially as a Beijing company with ties to power,” said Wang, the industry group head.  The increase in smartphone industry patent tussles comes as the intellectual property legal system steadily matures in China, where the government has sought to shed a copycat reputation and push cutting-edge innovation. In 2008, the State Council, China’s cabinet, issued guidelines prioritizing stronger IP protection and passed a major revision of patent law the following year. A Thomson Reuters analysis shows the number of patent infringement cases has more than tripled since 2006. At the end of last year, the government established a specialized court in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to hear intellectual property cases. The result, says Georgia Chiu, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells that specializes in technology patent law, is that “companies are starting to build up more confidence that the government is creating a better environment.” Meph Jia Gui, a lawyer at Global Law Office, said removing Qualcomm’s “umbrella” could drive many smaller mobile firms out of the market as they will face rising costs of litigation, buying patents and basic research. “In the long run, the removal of such a ‘free licensing dinner’ will force them to invest more in patent research,” Gui said.

451,QCOM,"Honeywell, OneWeb partner to offer satellite internet to aircraft","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc said on Monday it has teamed up with satellite internet startup OneWeb Ltd to expand the high-speed data services it offers to aircraft. OneWeb, whose investors include Richard Branson’s Virgin Group and Qualcomm Inc, plans to build a network of 648 low-orbit satellites capable of beaming fast internet around the world starting in 2019. Honeywell will use OneWeb’s bandwidth to provide aircraft services such as streaming maintenance data from engines and other equipment to the ground, transmitting weather and navigation data to pilots and supplying fast internet connections to passengers. The system also could stream black box flight data or cockpit video, ideas regulators are discussing, Honeywell said. Honeywell already supplies some services through satellite providers such as Iridium Communications Inc and Inmarsat Plc. But the faster speeds and low latency that OneWeb promises - at least 50 megabits per second per aircraft, and possibly much more - could in theory increase Honeywell’s market by three to five times, Carl Esposito, vice president of marketing and product management at Honeywell Aerospace, said in an interview.     “It’s a big opportunity,” he said. Because of the high bandwidth, “it really is transformational across the entire aircraft.”  The deal does not rule out or alter other partnerships. “It is very complementary to the solutions we’re already providing,” he said. Honeywell will also sell equipment that connects the aircraft to the satellite.  Honeywell says the agreement will allow it to target a wider range of aircraft, including smaller business and military planes, along with commercial jetliners. OneWeb says its system will be capable of providing 10 terabits of data per second, and much of that bandwidth will go to ground-based users in developing countries seeking internet access. Aircraft add another, potentially lucrative market, although the prices of OneWeb and Honeywell’s services have not been set.  OneWeb does not see a threat from other technology companies that provide global broadband such as Facebook Inc, Google Inc and SpaceX. “There’s an insane appetite for bandwidth,” Chief Executive Officer Greg Wyler said. “We’re going to make a dent in it with our system. But we’re not going to complete it.” OneWeb plans to start launching its small satellites in 2017, placing them about 750 miles above Earth.  The satellites will weigh 275 pounds (125 kilograms) and will be built with a partner. The satellite and launch partners have not been announced.

453,QCOM,Qualcomm seeks to pave road to marriage of cars and smartphones,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc, a maker of smartphone chips and software, unveiled on Monday fourth-generation LTE modems that will enable cars to stay better-connected wirelessly to cloud-based services via the Web.  Cars using the new technology should be on the market within a few years’ time. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X12 and X5 modems are designed to be embedded in cars and work with owners’ mobile devices to access a variety of Internet services, from streaming music to vehicle diagnostics. Cars are becoming a key battleground for technology industry giants, including Google Inc and Apple Inc, as they seek to develop a market where drivers will be online while on the road. “These modems will give carmakers and consumers an in-car experience that rivals the best smartphones,” said Kanwalinder Singh, senior vice president of business development for Qualcomm Technologies. “Consumer expectations of the experience inside the car are being driven by their experiences with their smartphones.” Singh said the new modems are faster and will support advanced telematics and infotainment systems being developed for cars that could hit the market in the next two to three years. Automakers and third-party service providers like the “ubiquitous connectivity” - the ability to stay connected to the Internet - offered by embedded modems.  The technology means, among other things, that dealerships can alert customers to when service is needed or if a part needs repair. In some cases, software can be upgraded over the air while the vehicle is parked overnight in a garage. Insurance companies would also be able to offer vehicle owners a “good driving” discount, if they agree to have their driving habits monitored wirelessly and transmitted over the in-vehicle modem. “The marriage of the smartphone and the car will be the next thing,” Singh said. In the future, mobile devices such as phones and tablets will be fully integrated with modems and software already embedded in the vehicle, he said. That means owners will be able to access a wider variety of apps and services, and their cars will be able to communicate wirelessly with other vehicles - a technology known as V2V - to help avoid potential accidents and traffic jams.

Cars using the new technology should be on the market within a few years’ time. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X12 and X5 modems are designed to be embedded in cars and work with owners’ mobile devices to access a variety of Internet services, from streaming music to vehicle diagnostics. Cars are becoming a key battleground for technology industry giants, including Google Inc and Apple Inc, as they seek to develop a market where drivers will be online while on the road. “These modems will give carmakers and consumers an in-car experience that rivals the best smartphones,” said Kanwalinder Singh, senior vice president of business development for Qualcomm Technologies. “Consumer expectations of the experience inside the car are being driven by their experiences with their smartphones.” Singh said the new modems are faster and will support advanced telematics and infotainment systems being developed for cars that could hit the market in the next two to three years. Automakers and third-party service providers like the “ubiquitous connectivity” - the ability to stay connected to the Internet - offered by embedded modems. The technology means, among other things, that dealerships can alert customers to when service is needed or if a part needs repair. In some cases, software can be upgraded over the air while the vehicle is parked overnight in a garage. Insurance companies would also be able to offer vehicle owners a “good driving” discount, if they agree to have their driving habits monitored wirelessly and transmitted over the in-vehicle modem. “The marriage of the smartphone and the car will be the next thing,” Singh said. In the future, mobile devices such as phones and tablets will be fully integrated with modems and software already embedded in the vehicle, he said. That means owners will be able to access a wider variety of apps and services, and their cars will be able to communicate wirelessly with other vehicles - a technology known as V2V - to help avoid potential accidents and traffic jams.

463,QCOM,Teardown of new Samsung Galaxy smartphone suggests deeper loss for Qualcomm,"SEOUL/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd used more of its own chips to power the new Galaxy S6 smartphone than it did for the predecessor S5, according to an early teardown report, in a blow to U.S. chip supplier Qualcomm Inc.  Samsung is not only using its own Exynos mobile processor, as had been widely reported, but also decided to rely on its in-house semiconductor business to source other parts, including the modem and power management integrated circuit chips, Ottawa-based consultancy Chipworks said in a web posting dated April 2. Samsung is counting on its new flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 edge phones to help revive earnings momentum after a disappointing 2014. Strong sales of system chips such as its Exynos processor could also help boost earnings, analysts and investors say. The Galaxy S6 also comes with Samsung’s Shannon modem chip, U.S. phone carrier AT&T; said on its website. “It’s pretty clear if they’re using Shannon for the modem for AT&T; that they’re trying to use all-Samsung silicon,” said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. “With their market share going down they’re under pressure to increase profit margins.” The findings suggest a deeper loss of business for Qualcomm in the new generation of Samsung’s flagship handsets than anticipated previously. Teardown reports of the predecessor Galaxy S5, released last year, showed the U.S. chipmaker supplied several components that Samsung has supplanted with its own this year, based on the phone Chipworks investigated.   Qualcomm said in January that a key customer declined to use its new Snapdragon processor in an upcoming flagship phone presumed to be Samsung’s Galaxy S6. But it had been unclear whether Samsung would drop Qualcomm’s modem chips as well.  Qualcomm is the industry leader in LTE, the most advanced modem technology, but Samsung, Intel, MediaTek and others have developing their own offerings.

466,QCOM,"UPDATE 2-Samsung expects record Galaxy shipments, S6 edge shortage","* Seeks to resolve supply issues for curved model quickly * Says could use Qualcomm chips in future products * Plans new wearable devices   (Adds comments from executives, analysts, background) By Se Young Lee SEOUL, April 9 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  expects record shipments for its new Galaxy S6 smartphones and said it will struggle to meet demand for the curved-edged version due to production constraints, adding to hopes for a turnaround in mobile sales. The S6 models are widely expected to sell briskly following a string of positive reviews, boosting prospects for an earnings recovery in 2015. This week, the company estimated its January-March operating profit to be its highest in three quarters, which analysts said was partly because Samsung put its own chips in the new phones. Samsung expects the flat screen S6 to sell more than the higher-margin S6 edge - priced about $120 more in South Korea - but mobile chief J.K. Shin said at a media event on Thursday the firm won’t be able to keep up with demand for the latter model in the near term because the curved screens are harder to manufacture. “Some carriers are switching existing orders to get more of the S6 edge, and it looks like demand for the model will exceed supply throughout this year,” said HMC Investment analyst Greg Roh. “That means average selling price will fall at a slower rate, which will have a positive impact on Samsung overall.” Samsung has not disclosed its shipment record for a handset. Analysts regard the Galaxy S3 as its best-selling model overall, though they estimate the Galaxy S4 to have done better in its initial year, when a model is most profitable. Nomura estimated that Samsung sold 80 million S3s in three years from its 2012 launch, and 43 million S4s from the model’s April 2013 launch to the end of that year. Some analysts say Samsung could ship 50 million or more S6 phones this year. Samsung’s Shin also said the South Korean electronics maker is preparing a variety of wearable devices, including a new version of its Gear smartwatch, but did not give specifics. Arch-rival Apple Inc is due to roll out its much-anticipated smartwatch on April 24. Shin acknowledged that Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from U.S.-based Qualcomm Inc. Samsung previously relied heavily on Qualcomm chips for its flagship phones, but recent reports based on dismantling Samsung’s handsets showed the firm replaced many Qualcomm chips with its own. Shin said the companies remain close partners. “We have to use the best engines to make our products competitive, which is why we opted to use our own chips,” Shin said. “But we may very well end up using products from Qualcomm again in the next Galaxy phone.” The new Galaxy devices go on sale in 20 countries on Friday.

467,QCOM,Wall St. declines as worries about earnings deepen,"(Reuters) - U.S. stocks dipped on Monday as fears increased that the strong dollar and lower oil prices will hurt U.S. first-quarter earnings. Nine of the 10 S&P; 500 sectors fell, led by a 1.1 percent decline in S&P; industrials. Shares of General Electric Co dropped 3.1 percent to $27.63 after rallying on Friday, when the company said it may return more than $90 billion to investors through 2018. Shares of 3M Co were down 0.7 percent at $165.84. The dollar was last up 0.1 percent against a basket of major currencies after hitting a peak of 99.99, its highest in four weeks. A stronger dollar tends to hurt profits for U.S. multinationals. U.S. crude oil prices edged higher, but their  sharp decline since last year has weighed on energy companies’ results. Corporate earnings kick into high gear this week. Estimates for first-quarter S&P; 500 results have fallen sharply since Jan. 1, with earnings for the period expected to have declined 2.9 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. “There is some trepidation about what the earnings announcements are going to look like, and so investors are cautious,” said John Carey, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston. “Most people are thinking earnings are going to be weak due the strong dollar, lower oil prices and sluggish consumer spending due to the winter weather. But we’ll see.” Among the companies expected to report this week are GE, Intel Corp and Johnson & Johnson, whose shares fell 1.5 percent to $100.55 on Monday. Several big banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co  and Bank of America Corp , also are due to report. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 80.61 points, or 0.45 percent, to 17,977.04; the S&P; 500 dropped 9.63 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,092.43, and the Nasdaq Composite eased 7.73 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,988.25. The Nasdaq briefly traded above 5,000, within 110 points of its all-time intraday high. In post-market trading, shares of Norfolk Southern Corp  fell 3.8 percent to $100.94 after the railroad gave a disappointing outlook.

469,QCOM,Jana Partners pressing Qualcomm to spin off chip business,"(Reuters) - Hedge fund Jana Partners said on Monday that Qualcomm Inc’s chip business was “essentially worthless” at current valuations and pressed the company to spin it off from its patent-licensing business to “restore investor confidence.” Jana also wants Qualcomm to cut costs, accelerate a share buyback, improve disclosures and refresh its board, the New York-based firm said in a quarterly letter to investors. “We believe that the board and management recognize the need to address its historical underperformance and improve investor perceptions of the company,” Jana said. While the buyback is a good step, Qualcomm needs to do more, including considering strategic deals, Jana said. Jana, which has investments totaling about $11 billion, said it owned about 4.4 million Qualcomm shares after investing about $2 billion in the company.

Qualcomm’s chip business is facing intense competition in a crowded smartphone-chip market. Earlier this year, longtime customer Samsung Electronics Co opted to use an internally developed processor for its new Galaxy S6 smartphone rather than Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon mobile chip. Qualcomm’s chips business has also been facing regulatory scrutiny in China. The company agreed to pay a fine of $975 million in February, ending a 14-month Chinese government investigation into anti-competitive practices. “Qualcomm has been accused of bundling, that is giving you a kickback on the chip if you pay them for royalties or vice versa, which is not considered a good way to do business in most countries,” Charter Equity Research analyst Edward Snyder said. Qualcomm’s shares were marginally down at $68.99 in afternoon trading.

477,QCOM,UPDATE 1-BlackRock's Fink tells S&P; 500 firms to think long-term,"(Adds investor reaction to Fink letter) By Jessica Toonkel NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc chief Larry Fink has asked the top executives of the 500 largest publicly listed U.S. companies urging them to take a long-term approach to create value for shareholders or risk losing his firm’s support. In a letter to the chief executive officers of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, Fink asked the companies to avoid short-term pressures created by the increasing activist shareholder activity of recent years. “It is critical ... to understand that corporate leaders’ duty of care and loyalty is not to every investor or trader who owns their companies’ shares at any moment in time, but to the company and its long term owners,” Fink wrote in the letter, dated March 31. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager. At the end of 2014, it had $4.65 trillion of assets under management. In 2014, dividends and buybacks in the United States totaled $900 billion, the highest ever, according to the letter. Through March, buyback authorizations totaled $257 billion, the fastest start to any year on record, according to Birinyi Associates. Many market analysts expect that a rise in interest rates will not derail the buyback boom bolstering stocks. The company made Fink’s letter available to Reuters after The New York Times first reported on the document on Monday evening, ahead of the company’s scheduled release of first-quarter results on Thursday. Given the low interest rate environment, such moves “send a discouraging message about a company’s ability to use its resources wisely and develop a coherent plan to create value over the long-term,” Fink wrote Corporate boards should act as “the first line of defense” against short-term pressures.” In the last two years, activists have taken positions in some of the largest U.S. corporations seeking larger share repurchases, divestitures or other corporate action. The companies targeted included Apple Inc, General Motors Co, DuPont and Qualcomm Inc. Hank Smith, chief investment officer of Haverford Trust Co, which has $8.2 billion in assets under management, disagrees with Fink and believes most activists now are more long-term than the corporate raiders of the 1980s. “I think the majority of activist investors today are really investors and are not going into this to slash and burn,” Smith told Reuters in an interview Tuesday afternoon. For example, Smith applauded Nelson Peltz’ Trian Fund Management LP for taking a long-term approach with its campaign against the management of chemicals and agricultural company DuPont. Trian is pushing the company’s board to be more accountable and argues it should be split in two. The fund is pushing for four seats on DuPont’s board. “I think Trian represents a positive influence,” he said. Smith also disagrees with Fink that dividends are a sign  companies are thinking short-term. “Dividends are the mother’s milk of returns to investors,” said Smith, who only invests in companies that pay them. “Dividend increases are the most tangible statement management can make about the firm’s fundamentals and future prospects.” For its part, BlackRock has revised its proxy guidelines to highlight it expects board members to protect shareholders against short-term thinking. Firms that have a long-term strategy to create shareholder value, as well as credible metrics to assess performance, will have BlackRock’s support during periods of underperformance. “In such cases, we will take action to ensure that the owners’ interest are effectively served,” he wrote. Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles and known as the Warren Buffett of bonds, shared Fink’s sentiments. “In a number of cases, in the tech area among the most prominent of the examples, is where you ought to be reinvesting in the business,” he said. “There’s too much catering to quarterly earnings engineering slash activist shareholders.”    (Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan.

The world’s largest contract chip manufacturer booked T$79 billion ($2.54 billion) for January-March, compared with the T$77.8 billion average estimate of 22 analysts polled by Reuters. The company also reported a quarterly revenue rise of 49.8 percent, as devices from watches to washing machines require more chips. Shares of TSMC closed up 2.8 percent ahead of the earnings release, versus a 1.2 percent rise in the overall TAIEX  index. Company-watchers are skittish about the firm’s future as competition intensifies to produce the smallest, most energy-efficient chips against rivals Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  and Intel Corp. Most agree TSMC lost orders to Samsung to produce chips for Apple’s next-generation iPhone, likely due out this year. Estimates for TSMC’s share in the next iteration of the hot-selling gadget range from 30 percent to 50 percent. Samsung also last week said it opted for its own chips for its latest flagship phone over chips from Qualcomm Inc, which contracts a large share of its production to TSMC. Declining prices for smartphones worldwide may also drive handset makers to contract smaller players Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp and hometown rival United Microelectronics Corp who offer more competitive prices for less-advanced technology, analysts say.

But with A1/A+ ratings, no debt outstanding and some US$32bn of cash on hand, Qualcomm is highly unlikely to take heed - and investors are expected to shrug off Jana’s complaints as well. “Qualcomm is a US$113bn company,” said Matt Duch, senior portfolio manager at Calvert Investments. “So I’m sure the (buy-side) response is: they are too big for Jana to really influence management decisions.” Jana is widely seen as the biggest and toughest of all hedge fund activists, and typically its involvement would spell nothing but trouble for a company. Moreover, its gripes about Qualcomm’s recent performance are understandable. Qualcomm shares have slumped almost 9% year-to-date, and the company is facing intense competition from the likes of Samsung, MediaTek and Intel. “We believe that the board and management recognise the need to address its historical underperformance and improve investor perceptions of the company,” Jana said this week, calling Qualcomm’s chip business “essentially worthless” at current valuations. But with its strong ratings and lack of debt, Qualcomm has the ability to issue tens of billions of dollars of bonds for shareholder-friendly actions - and still remain single A rated with cash to spare. “As a bondholder you’re always concerned that a company may pursue more aggressive financial policies to boost shareholder returns,” said Scott Kimball, portfolio manager at Taplin, Canida & Habacht. “But an inaugural issuance in the A rated technology bucket by a company with no debt outstanding would appeal to a wide audience.” With demand for high-quality corporates increasing with every drop in government bond yields worldwide, investors are more willing to accept bonds that mitigate risks with covenants. “In this market, Qualcomm could structure the bond issuance with strong covenants (change of control language, limitations on leverage and subordination) and enough credit spread to overcome the Jana Partners overhang,” said Kimball. “In fact, one could argue that debt with heavy covenants limits Jana’s flexibility.” Jana is hardly alone when it comes to activism, which has skyrocketed in the US since the credit crisis. With large piles of offshore cash, tech companies like Qualcomm and Apple - which bowed to pressure with its first-ever bond for a share buyback two years ago - are regular targets. According to Moody’s, tech companies were the target of 20% of all such activism in 2014. And the ratings agency said there had been 55 cases across 14 non-financial industry sectors by early April, versus 43 in the same period in 2014. Qualcomm would be one of the last of the tech giants to bite the bullet and put debt on its balance sheet to pay for shareholder-friendly actions, and the market is gearing up for a bond deal as large as US$10bn. While there is no official mandate yet, expectations are that deal will surface soon after the company announces earnings on April 22. A bond would help finance a US$15bn share buyback plan announced by the company in March, about two-thirds of which it aims to do this year. Some analysts say Qualcomm could easily issue up to US$20bn and still keep a low single A rating. And the investment-grade bond market has proven time and again that it can absorb mammoth deals in one fell swoop - even for lower rated issuers like Actavis, which sold US$21bn across 10 tranches in March. Actavis is rated Baa3/BBB-/BBB-. “While we originally thought management would take leverage up to 1.0x, indicating a US$10bn issuance, we think that with activist pressure, Qualcomm may end up with closer to US$20bn of debt over time,” said Erin Lyons, technology analyst at CreditSights. “At this level, Qualcomm could hold onto a low single A rating, given it would still have a sizeable net cash position.” ",4172015,http://www.reuters.com/article/qualcomm-bond/hedge-fund-pressure-unlikely-to-block-qualcomm-bond-idUSL2N0XA1NI20150417

To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at . Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT) Week Ahead A slew of Dow 30 companies report results in the week: Chemicals conglomerate DuPont, industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp and property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies Inc on Tuesday; planemaker Boeing Co, beverage maker Coca-Cola Co and McDonald’s Corp on Wednesday; and diversified manufacturer 3M Co, Procter & Gamble and Microsoft Corp on Thursday. While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc’s first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald’s new CEO, is charged with reviving the company’s falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M’s first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy. Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google’s future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again. Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street’s expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world’s largest social network’s business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets. Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company’s next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram. Investors will be looking out for the company’s outlook for the remainder of 2015. On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices. On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines. Analysts and investors will be looking out for any details on the tax-free sale of its Alibaba shares. General Motors Co reports first-quarter results before the market opens on Thursday. Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before. On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts’ average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer’s flagship smartphone. Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from Qualcomm. The chipmaker had also warned that “challenges” with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China. Qualcomm recently came under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners to spin off its chip business from its patent-licensing business. Credit Suisse reports earnings for the first three months of 2015 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Friday the Swiss bank will ask shareholders to sign off in a symbolic vote on executive pay for 2014, when Credit Suisse became the largest bank in decades to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes. Investors will focus on existing home sales on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 3.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. Also, data for new home sales is expected to be released on Thursday. On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department releases data for durable goods. Starbucks Corp reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. Starbucks is one of the restaurant industry’s top performers, but investors and analysts worry that its streak of red-hot growth is coming to an end. The company has a variety of plans in place to boost sales (adding booze, smoothies, more lunch and dinner options, improving and expanding tea selections and testing delivery) and investors will be looking for proof that those are working. On Tuesday, Yum Brands Inc will report its first-quarter results. Yum’s China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from the latest food scandal in its biggest market. Analysts say the company is suffering from “brand fatigue” in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is slated to announce results for the first quarter on Tuesday. Chipotle is still having problems finding pork suppliers to replace the one it suspended for running afoul of its animal welfare rules. The company says customers have simply switched to other meats and that it isn’t losing sales - but investors will be on alert for any signs of a slowdown. Drugmaker Biogen Inc is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Friday, driven by strong sales of its top-selling oral MS drug, Tecfidera, which has seen burgeoning sales since its launch in 2013. Biogen, which leads the United States multiple sclerosis market with five drugs for the condition, recently reported promising data for its Alzheimer’s drug. Investors will also be looking for commentary on Tecfider’s growth expectations, and potential for competition, as well as the longer-acting MS injectable Plegridy. AbbVie Inc, whose planned $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics Inc is meant to lessen the company’s dependence on its blockbuster Humira arthritis drug, is expected to report sharply higher earnings and sales for the first quarter on Thursday, fueled by Humira’s continuing growth and sales of the company’s recently approved Viekira Pak treatment for hepatitis C. Investors will be keen for details on sales prospects for Viekira Pak, given steep price discounts AbbVie has given to compete with Gilead Science Inc’s potent treatments for the liver disease. Eli Lilly and Co is expected to report higher first-quarter earnings on Thursday as the Indianapolis drugmaker begins to recover from patent expirations that slashed demand for its biggest products. The company is well positioned to deliver a promised return to profit growth this year, helped by new treatments for cancer and diabetes and growing sales of its animal health brands. Abbott Laboratories will report its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Recovering sales of Abbott Laboratories’ infant formulas, following costly recalls in Asia, and improving performance of the company’s branded generic medicines, are expected to drive quarterly earnings growth despite the negative impact of the stronger dollar. Ebay Inc is expected to report results for the first quarter largely in line with Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. The company has seen strong growth in payments business as well as its non-auction e-commerce business. Analysts expect that the company will continue to benefit from the rise in demand for mobile devices, as consumers increasingly use their smart phones and tablets to shop online. Investors will look for details on the company’s plans for the spinoff of PayPal scheduled for the second half of 2015. On Thursday, Dow Chemical Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit due to a stronger dollar and a slowdown in its agricultural business. The company last month said it would offload a bulk of its low-margin bleach and vinyl-related business to Olin in a $5 billion. Investors will be looking for further comments on the company’s cost-saving plans. Johnson Controls Inc, the auto parts supplier and maker of climate control systems for buildings, is expected to report higher second-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by higher sales in its seating and interiors business as auto sales and production rose in the first quarter. The company’s buildings efficiency business, which provides air conditioning equipment and building management services, is also expected to report higher revenue as U.S. office vacancy rate declined to its lowest level since the third quarter to 2009. Investors will be looking for comments on Johnson Controls’ business focus and outlook following the sale of its workplace solutions business to CBRE Group. Pentagon’s No. 1 arms supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, reports first-quarter results on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin has been focusing on increasing sales to commercial customers in United States as well as international governments to make up for pressures from tight U.S. defense spending. Lockheed gets 17 percent of its revenue from international markets and 1 percent from U.S. commercial customers. Investors will be looking to see if Lockheed still expects U.S. military spending to meaningfully pick up this year. Weapons maker Raytheon Co has increased exposure to international markets, which account for about 27 percent of its total sales, as U.S. defense spending remains tight. The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system forecast disappointing 2015 revenue in January as domestic orders remained weak. When the company will report its first-quarter results on Thursday, investors will be looking for an update on a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that Raytheon expected to win in the first quarter. On Tuesday, Omnicom Group Inc, the No. 1 U.S. advertising company, is expected to report first-quarter results largely in-line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Omnicom had warned that a strong dollar would hit revenue this year. Omnicom, whose clients include Apple, McDonald’s and Adidas, gets a little less than half of its revenue from outside the United States. On Friday, Interpublic Group of Companies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ average estimate according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company’s previous quarter was helped by higher ad spending by businesses in the United States. On Tuesday, chipmaker Broadcom Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect the company’s connectivity business to sequentially decline as it comes off a strong Apple-driven fourth quarter. Analysts will be looking for the company to provide outlook for the quarter ending June. On Wednesday, data storage company EMC Corp is expected to report first-quarter profit and revenue below analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had in January forecast a lower-than-expected profit for 2015 and said it would cut jobs. The company, which earns nearly half of its revenue from international markets, is expected to be hurt by a strong dollar. Analysts say enterprise storage demand has been mixed in quarter which may hurt EMC. Virtualization software maker VMware Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ estimate on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, hurt by a stronger dollar. More than 48 percent of VMware’s revenue comes from outside the United States. Analysts at Wells Fargo estimate a negative impact of 3-4 percent from foreign currency on license revenue growth. Programmable chip maker Xilinx Inc will report fourth-quarter results after markets close on Wednesday. The company, which dominates the programmable chip market along with Altera Corp, is expected to report profit and revenue that are largely in line with analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will look for updates on sales to the broadcast, consumer and automotive end market and sales to communications and data center customers. PulteGroup Inc’s first-quarter results are expected to be released on Thursday. Coming on the heels of larger peer D.R. Horton’s second-quarter results on Wednesday, PulteGroup’s results are expected to provide further evidence of a strong spring selling season this year, suggesting that a slowdown in housing starts in the first three months did not point to underlying weakness in the U.S. housing market. Steelmaker Nucor Corp will report first-quarter results on Thursday. Nucor has been struggling with lower selling prices due to high levels of imports. Declining oil prices have also led to excess inventory in Nucor’s pipe and tube business. Analysts will be looking for comments on inventory, steel demand and overcapacity in its steel mills business. On Thursday, Patterson-UTI Energy Inc, the second-largest land driller in North America, is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit as weak oil prices weigh on drilling activity. Patterson, which halved its rig construction program for this year, had warned that 2015 would be “challenging,” having received indications that customers could terminate a number of longer-term contracts early. Investors will be looking for updates on further cost saving measures and commentary on contracts and dayrates for its 16 new high-tech Apex rigs, which analysts believe could help the driller boost cash margins this year. Contract driller Nabors Industries Ltd, which is merging with C&J; Energy, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as drilling activity continues to be hurt by the fall in oil prices. The company has already warned of weak activity and pricing pressure in its international operations. Investors will be looking for updates on any job cuts and the company’s plans to idle rigs in an oversupplied market. On Tuesday, coal miner Arch Coal Inc is expected to report a ninth straight quarterly loss and on Thursday, coal miner Peabody Energy Corp is expected to report a wider first-quarter loss due to continued weakness in coal prices. Kimberly-Clark Corp, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, is expected to report better-than-expected first-quarter sales, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, helped by growing demand in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and South Africa. However, higher input costs and a stronger dollar could have hurt profit. The company said in February it would transfer pension obligations to two insurers to reduce risk and will take a charge in the second quarter. It had also warned of an 8-9 percent drop in 2015 sales hurt by the dollar and weak demand for core products such as Huggies diapers. Investors will be looking for any updates on forecast on Tuesday. Hershey Co, the maker of Hershey’s Kisses and Reese’s peanut butter cups, has been struggling with high cocoa and dairy costs and intense competition from rivals such as Mondelez and Mars. To tackle growing competition, the company has been pouring money in advertisements and promotions, but this is expected to hurt its full-year earnings per share by 2 percentage points. It has also tried to diversify and add a new stream of revenue by acquiring jerky maker Krave Pure Foods Inc in January, marking its first foray into meat snacks. When the company will report its first-quarter profit on Thursday, investors will be looking out for comments on whether the company will make more acquisitions in the meat and bakery snacks category, which are becoming more popular than candy, and the effect of the strong dollar on its outlook. Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc will report its first-quarter results on Thursday. Investors will be looking at how much Boston’s record snowfall hurt results at Dunkin Brands, whose Dunkin’ Donuts shops are concentrated in the U.S. northeast. Experts say the impact could be meaningful. Under Armour Inc, a sports apparel and footwear maker, is expected to report profit and sales for the first quarter in line with analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect Under Armour to continue its 19-quarter streak of reporting more than 20 percent growth in revenue, helped by expanded offerings in sport and outdoor clothing, strong demand for its Speedform Apollo running shoes, new launches in basketball footwear and sponsorship deals. The company is also expected to benefit from investments in its fast-growing digital platform and from the acquisitions of fitness tracking apps Endomondo and MyFitnessPal. When the company will report on Tuesday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and color on the performance of new launches in footwear. Hanesbrands Inc, the innerwear and apparel maker is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts are projecting first-quarter sales growth of more than 15 percent as the company benefits from higher sales of sport and gym clothing at department stores, and the acquisition of DBApparel and Maidenform Brands. When the company reports on Thursday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and more color on the company’s recent acquisition of college logo clothing maker Knights Apparel. Ingersoll-Rand Plc, the maker of Trane air conditioners and Thermo King refrigeration units, is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by growth in global industrial and construction markets. Investors will be looking for the impact of a strong dollar on the company’s industrial business, which has a higher proportion of revenue coming from outside the United States. Investors will also be looking for an update on how much the weakness in oil prices has hurt the company’s newly acquired centrifugal compression business. Xerox Corp, which has been shifting its focus to IT services from making printers and copiers, is expected to report first-quarter revenue that is slightly below analysts’ estimate on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Xerox had cut its profit forecast for 2015 for the second time after reporting its sixth-consecutive drop in revenue last quarter. In December, the company agreed to sell its IT outsourcing arm to Atos. Teck Resources Ltd, Canada’s largest diversified miner, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as prices for both copper and steel-making coal remain depressed amid a fall in demand. The company in March denied media reports that it was in talks to merge with Chilean copper producer Antofagasta. Teck CEO also refuted speculations of a possible merger with HudBay Minerals or an acquisition of Zaldivar, a copper mine owned by Barrick Gold. Teck said in February it might reduce its dividend in July if the industry-wide production cuts fail to boost coal prices. Investors will be interested in any comments of a possible merger or acquisition and demand for steel-making coal. Car seat maker Lear Corp is expected to report higher first-quarter profit on Friday helped by strong demand in North America and a rise in vehicle production. Some analysts expect Lear to benefit from cheaper commodity prices and report higher margins. Investors will look for Lear’s comments on Mercato Capital seeking a split of the auto parts suppliers businesses. Investment bank and asset manager Lazard Ltd reports first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Lazard is expected to benefit from a jump in corporate dealmaking, which should have boosted its M&A; advisory business. Globally, deals worth $811.8 billion were announced in the first quarter, up 21 percent, compared to a year earlier. Among them, Lazard advised on the merger of Heinz-Kraft and the sale of Serbia’s state-operated Telekom Srbija. However, analysts expect lower-than-anticipated deal completions to weigh on the company’s quarterly revenue. Lazard has been focusing more on asset management to be less reliant on financial advisory fees. AutoNation Inc, the largest U.S. car dealer chain, reports first-quarter results on Wednesday. Investors will be watching margins on new car sales, any potential expansion moves and for any concerns about U.S. consumer spending going forward. On Thursday, Qlik Technologies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on higher demand for its data analytics software. The company had forecast full-year adjusted profit below analysts’ average estimate and its revenue forecast was also largely below Wall Street estimates. Touchscreen chipmaker Synaptics Inc is expected to report third-quarter profit below analysts’ estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on weak demand from smartphone makers. Analysts have said that certain Samsung designs that have come out recently are not using Synaptics touch IC products. Online music streaming service provider Pandora Media Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts’ average estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company is expected to benefit from stronger listening hours and its gradual move into automobiles, where more than half of all radio listening occurs in the U.S. Investors will look for updates on user and local ad growth. On Wednesday, specialty mattress maker Select Comfort Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts’ average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, halting a run of four straight quarters where sales beat expectations. Investors will be looking out for the company’s Sleep Number mattress sales as well as for any changes in full-year outlook. The company provided 2015 profit forecast below estimates in February. On Friday, Apigee Corp, which develops software to manage web applications, is expected to raise up to $92 million in its IPO, valuing the company at about $523.8 million at the higher end of its IPO price range. The company’s software platform allows businesses to design and deploy application programming interfaces (API) to link its core IT systems with data used by customers, others. The company primarily offers application interface management and predictive analysis services. On Tuesday, Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver will present the annual federal budget for the fiscal year that began on April 1, the last budget before the general election scheduled for October. He has promised a balanced budget and has pledged to introduce balanced budget legislation as well. The Conservative government has already introduced a package of tax cuts and family benefits, and infrastructure spending, that has soaked up much of the anticipated surplus. A decline in oil prices has cut much of the remaining room for maneuver. Prime Minister Stephen Harper has ruled out major stimulus spending, arguing that despite cheap oil the economy was still growing. On Thursday Mexico’s national statistics office will release economic activity data for February, after the gauge expanded in January on a pickup in services and agriculture while industry sank. Also on Thursday, Mexico will release annual inflation data for the first half of April, after the indicator picked up to 3.14 in March, reaching just above the central bank’s 3 percent target. Retail sales data released on Friday will reveal how the gauge fared in February, after it rose at its fastest pace in over a year in January. Monday, April 20 International Business Machines Corp is expected to report lower revenue for the 12th straight quarter, as it exits unprofitable businesses and attempts to move into cloud-focused areas, away from its traditional hardware and consulting services foundation. Net profit for the first quarter is expected to rise slightly. Morgan Stanley is expected to report a rise in first-quarter earnings. The company’s institutional securities business now depends more on equities trading business, rather than fixed income trading. Rival Goldman Sachs’s strong performance in stock trading in the first quarter puts the spotlight on Morgan Stanley. The bank has also been focusing more on its wealth management business. It is trying to squeeze more revenue out of its major businesses by getting wealth clients to use investment banking and trading services. Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, who helped execute a sweeping cost-cutting strategy across several business lines at the bank, will step down to join Google as its finance chief next month. Halliburton Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit, hurt by soft drilling activity. Oil producers have significantly scaled back spending amid weak oil prices. However, cost cuts and continued strength in the Middle East and Asia are expected to help the oilfield services provider minimize the effects of the oil downturn. The company has said it would cut more than 6,000 jobs and investors will seek details about any further cost cuts, especially after Schlumberger cut 11,000 more jobs. Halliburton is looking to complete its $35 billion-acquisition of smaller rival Baker Hughes, which is expected to report its own first-quarter results on Tuesday. Investors will want to know about more potential asset sales after Halliburton said earlier it would sell three businesses to pave the way for regulatory clearance for the deal. Investors will also look to see if the deal will help it better cope with pricing pressure from oil producers. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, the world’s second-largest cruise operator by revenue, is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales below analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had forecast revenue below expectations, citing a strong dollar and weak pricing in the Caribbean. Investors will be looking out for any changes in full-year forecast and comments on the Caribbean market, as well as updates on expansion in Europe and Asia. Toymaker Hasbro Inc will report first-quarter results before the bell. The sequels of “Jurassic Park” and “The Avengers” in first half of 2015 and the new “Star Wars” movie in December are expected to boost Hasbro’s sales this year and keep it growing at a faster pace than larger rival Mattel Inc’s.

483,QCOM,Qualcomm to tap Samsung Elec to make new mobile processors - report,"SEOUL, April 21 (Reuters) - U.S. chip maker Qualcomm Inc  plans to have its next-generation Snapdragon 820 mobile processors manufactured by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , tech news website Re/code reported, citing unnamed sources. The move comes after Samsung opted to use its own Exynos processors for the recently launched flagship Galaxy S6 devices instead of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810, prompting the U.S. firm to cut is financial outlook for the year. Samsung and Qualcomm declined to comment on Re/code’s report. The report, dated April 20, did not say whether Qualcomm was looking at other manufacturers for the 820 processor besides Samsung. The report suggests gathering momentum for Samsung’s system chips business, which investors and analysts expect will swing to profit this year. That could be negative for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), which analysts say has gotten the bulk of Qualcomm’s orders for high-end chips. Samsung’s 14-nanometer manufacturing technology gives the firm an edge over rivals such as TSMC, as smaller chips are more energy-efficient and deliver better performance. Investors and analysts say the superior technology will lead to more outside orders for Samsung’s contract manufacturing business and further boost earnings. Media reports say Samsung will make processors for Apple Inc’s new iPhones expected to launch later this year, and the firm also recently added Nvidia Corp as a contract manufacturing client.

484,QCOM,Qualcomm forecast misses as customer loss hurts mobile chip sales,"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc forecast current-quarter revenue and profit below analysts’ expectations, saying the loss of a key customer and delays in product launches by some smartphone makers would hurt sales of its flagship Snapdragon chips. Shares of the company, which also reported a 46 percent drop in second-quarter profit, were down about 2 percent in extended trading on Wednesday. Earlier this year, longtime customer Samsung Electronics Co opted to use an internally developed processor for its new Galaxy S6 smartphone and Note rather than Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon mobile chip. The company also cut its full-year revenue and profit forecast for the second time, citing lower sales of Snapdragon chips. “I think the recovery of the (chipset) business, given the loss of share at Samsung, will take time,” Topeka Capital Markets analyst Suji Desilva said, adding that a recovery was unlikely in the near term. Most of Qualcomm’s revenue comes from selling baseband chips, which enable phones to communicate with carrier networks, but a majority of its profit comes from licensing patents for its CDMA cellphone technology. Hedge fund Jana Partners has been putting pressure on the company to spin off the chip business from its highly profitable patent-licensing business. Lst week, the fund said Qualcomm’s chip business was “essentially worthless” at current valuations. On a post-earnings conference call, the company said it had hired an “outside expert” to review the cost structure of its chip business in order to drive growth. Qualcomm’s high-margin licensing business has also had its fair share of problems. The company agreed in February to pay a fine of $975 million, the largest in China’s corporate history, to settle a long-standing antitrust probe by the government. Much of the decline in Qualcomm’s profit for the second quarter was due to the settlement, which also requires the company to lower its royalty rates on patents used in China. The company forecast an adjusted profit of 85 cents-$1 per share and revenue of $5.4 billion-$6.2 billion for the third quarter. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.14 per share and revenue of $6.50 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned $1.40 per share. Revenue rose 8.3 percent to $6.89 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.33 per share and revenue of $6.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

485,QCOM,UPDATE 2-Qualcomm forecast misses as customer loss hurts mobile chip sales,"(Adds details, analyst comment, details from conference call) By Lehar Maan and Kshitiz Goliya April 22 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc forecast current-quarter revenue and profit below analysts’ expectations, saying the loss of a key customer and delays in product launches by some smartphone makers would hurt sales of its flagship Snapdragon chips. Shares of the company, which also reported a 46 percent drop in second-quarter profit, were down about 2 percent in extended trading on Wednesday. Earlier this year, longtime customer Samsung Electronics Co  opted to use an internally developed processor for its new Galaxy S6 smartphone and Note rather than Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon mobile chip. The company also cut its full-year revenue and profit forecast for the second time, citing lower sales of Snapdragon chips. “I think the recovery of the (chipset) business, given the loss of share at Samsung, will take time,” Topeka Capital Markets analyst Suji Desilva said, adding that a recovery was unlikely in the near term. Most of Qualcomm’s revenue comes from selling baseband chips, which enable phones to communicate with carrier networks, but a majority of its profit comes from licensing patents for its CDMA cellphone technology. Hedge fund Jana Partners has been putting pressure on the company to spin off the chip business from its highly profitable patent-licensing business. Lst week, the fund said Qualcomm’s chip business was “essentially worthless” at current valuations. On a post-earnings conference call, the company said it had hired an “outside expert” to review the cost structure of its chip business in order to drive growth. Qualcomm’s high-margin licensing business has also had its fair share of problems. The company agreed in February to pay a fine of $975 million, the largest in China’s corporate history, to settle a long-standing antitrust probe by the government. Much of the decline in Qualcomm’s profit for the second quarter was due to the settlement, which also requires the company to lower its royalty rates on patents used in China. The company forecast an adjusted profit of 85 cents-$1 per share and revenue of $5.4 billion-$6.2 billion for the third quarter. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.14 per share and revenue of $6.50 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned $1.40 per share. Revenue rose 8.3 percent to $6.89 billion. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.33 per share and revenue of $6.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Hwang Won-chul, a director at the Korea Fair Trade Commission, told Reuters that Oracle also requires customers to pay for maintenance services for all Oracle software being used instead of being able to pick and choose which software the customers want maintenance services for. “We have not decided on whether there will be any sanctions against Oracle,” the official said, adding that a final ruling will likely come in June or July. The Oracle probe comes as the South Korean regulator investigates U.S. chip maker Qualcomm Inc over whether the company abused its dominant market position in the country. The commission has not divulged additional details on that investigation. Oracle could not be immediately reached for comment.

488,QCOM,"GE ties up with Qualcomm, Apple in new lighting business bet","(Reuters) - General Electric Co on Monday announced collaborations with Qualcomm Inc and Apple Inc as it uses digital technology and the growing appetite for data to reinvigorate its 130-year-old lighting business. With chipmaker Qualcomm, GE is offering retailers a way to connect with shoppers’ smartphones through technology embedded in LED light bulbs, the company said. One use of the “indoor positioning” technology could be to transmit customized coupons to shoppers depending on their store location. GE also said it will produce an LED bulb compatible with Apple’s yet-to-launch connected-device platform HomeKit. The bulb can change colors to align with the natural rhythms of the body. The tie-ups underscore GE’s plans to dive into the emerging and increasingly competitive market for connected lighting that integrates with smart devices. While GE sees an opportunity in selling energy-efficient LED bulbs, it will seek to use sensors and other technology embedded in LEDs to the advantage of consumers, businesses and cities, said Beth Comstock, who leads GE Business Innovations. Services offered by GE stand to provide revenue that could offset pressure should the LED bulb business become more commoditized. “There’s now a data stream from light that is going to create opportunity to be more productive,” said Comstock, in her first interview about the lighting strategy since September, when the unit became part of GE’s innovations division. GE itself is undergoing a sweeping overhaul, jettisoning the bulk of its finance division to focus on big-ticket industrial products such as jet engines and power turbines. Some analysts have speculated the U.S. conglomerate will divest lighting after deciding last year to sell its appliances segment and moves by Siemens and Philips to hive off lighting units. GE Lighting totaled about $2.5 billion in revenue last year, 2.3 percent of the company’s overall industrial sales. Comstock said lighting fits smoothly with GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt’s desire to marry software and analytics with GE’s various industrial equipment, which GE calls the “Industrial Internet.” “LEDs plus software, it helps GE continue its Industrial Internet expansion and I think the lighting business has a big role in GE’s future because of that,” Comstock said. Along with traditional lighting manufacturers, the “intelligent lighting” market is drawing companies that manage other building controls such as Honeywell, and start-ups focused on lighting controls, according to Jesse Foote, analyst at Navigant Research. “There are so many kinds of companies getting into the space,” Foote said.

500,QCOM,"Avago, Broadcom deal could put pressure on Qualcomm","(Reuters) - Avago Technologies Ltd’s (AVGO.O) $37 billion deal to buy chipmaker Broadcom  Corp BRCM.O creates new competitive challenges for Qualcomm and may force the world’s largest mobile chip maker to radically rethink its own strategy. Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), which has dominated the market for connectivity chips on smartphones, has been looking to extend its reach into data centers and network infrastructure, but may find its way blocked by an enlarged competitor combining Avago’s strength in storage and Broadcom’s power in networking. “Qualcomm has aspirations of moving into Intel’s data center processor incumbency that the Avago storage and now enterprise networking (from Broadcom) capability directly overlays,” said Drexel Hamilton analyst Richard Whittington.  That could result in Qualcomm creating some sort of partnership with Intel Corp (INTC.O), he said, to combat the reach of the new company. Wall Street analysts generally cheered the deal on Thursday, despite some fretting about price, saying Broadcom’s strength  in wireless networking, WiFi and Bluetooth chips is a good complement to Avago’s presence in industrial and wired devices. That presents a challenge to Qualcomm, which finds itself in a tough spot in the maturing microprocessor business, as smartphone makers such as Samsung (005930.KS), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Huawei (002502.SZ) put more effort into producing their own chips. Now a Avago/Broadcom tie-up - which will take the name of Broadcom - potentially gives handset makers another viable supplier, giving them more leverage and putting even more pressure on Qualcomm, said IDC analyst Mario Morales. “The other material impact will come from the adjacencies that Qualcomm is trying to enter now, the data center, infrastructure and the consumer area,” he added. “We see a lot of synergy in the technology they (Avago) are buying.” Qualcomm has hinted that it is looking at new areas.  “I think there’s going to be a tremendous amount of growth in computing and resources dedicated to supporting the cloud,” Qualcomm chief executive Steve Mollenkopf said at last year’s Consumer Electronics Show. “We look at that as an opportunity for a company like ours.” The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment on its strategic plans in response to the Broadcom deal on Thursday. Avago/Broadcom is just the latest in a wave of heavyweight mergers and acquisitions reshaping the chip industry.  NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) unveiled a deal in March to buy smaller peer Freescale Semiconductor Ltd FSL.N. In the same month, Reuters reported that Intel was in talks to buy chipmaker Altera Corp (ALTR.O), which many investors expect to result in a deal soon. That backdrop of consolidation may force Qualcomm’s hand. “Either divest themselves of the business that they are in that is in direct competition with Broadcom - and now Avago - or find a way to grow their presence,” said Chris Geier, partner-in-charge of Sikich Investment Banking, assessing Qualcomm’s options. “They are going to have to do one or the other. The status quo for them at this point won’t work.” ",5282015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-broadcom-m-a-qualcomm-analysis/avago-broadcom-deal-could-put-pressure-on-qualcomm-idUSKBN0OD2YC20150528

504,QCOM,Ex-Qualcomm exec gets one-and-a-half years in prison for insider trades,"(Reuters) - A former high-ranking executive at semiconductor maker Qualcomm Inc was sentenced on Friday to a year and a half in prison and fined $500,000 for masterminding a three-year insider trading scheme.  Jing Wang, formerly Qualcomm’s president of global business operations, made hundreds of thousands of dollars in illicit profits from buying shares of Qualcomm and another company based on knowledge gained in his elevated position, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.  Wang, 52, of Del Mar, California, pleaded guilty in July last year to charges of insider trading, money laundering and obstruction of justice in connection with his scheme. According to the Justice Department, Wang admitted to three separate insider trades using a brokerage account in the British Virgin Islands. In early 2010, he bought about $277,000 worth of Qualcomm stock, with prior knowledge that the company planned to increase its dividend and repurchase stock. In December 2010, he bought stock of chipmaker Atheros with the knowledge that Qualcomm planned to make an offer to purchase the company.  A few weeks after that, he told his stockbroker, Gary Yin, to sell the Atheros stock and purchase Qualcomm stock, just one day before the company announced record earnings.   Wang pleaded guilty to money laundering for transferring his illegal proceeds between entities he controlled in the British Virgin Islands, and also admitted to obstructing justice by concocting a plan whereby he and stockbroker Yin would blame Wang’s brother Bing Wang, who lived in rural China, for the insider trading scheme. Yin pleaded guilty to conspiring to obstruct justice and launder money, and is scheduled to be sentenced on July 17.  Wang’s sentence was imposed by U.S. District Judge William Q. Hayes of the Southern District of California.

507,QCOM,Qualcomm has no plans to spin off chip business at present: chairman,"SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc has no plans to spin off its chips business at present, Executive Chairman Paul Jacobs said on Tuesday, despite recent investor pressure to do so amid intensifying industry competition.  Hedge fund Jana Partners said in April Qualcomm should spin off the chip business from its patent-licensing business to improve shareholder value, calling the chip business “essentially worthless”. “We’ve had that discussion for a long time, many years the board has looked at it but we still think the synergies of having the businesses together outweighs the dissynergies,” Jacobs told Reuters on the sidelines of an American Chamber of Commerce event in Seoul.  Jacobs said, however, that the company is always evaluating its options and that the situation could change in the future.

508,QCOM,China economic uncertainty a potential risk for U.S. chipmakers,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tumbling markets and economic uncertainty in China pose a risk to major chipmakers such as Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) that derive a big portion of their sales from the world’s second-largest economy. Consumer electronics giant Apple Inc (AAPL.O) could also be vulnerable - 17 percent of the company’s overall revenue last fiscal year came from China, and in the most recent quarter it sold more iPhones in the country than in the United States for the first time. But the slowing pace of China’s economic growth - on top of already weakening demand for mobile devices - could deliver a particularly tough blow to chipmakers, analysts said.  “When you have waning demand hitting at the same time (as the stock market uncertainty), it just makes that industry that much more difficult,” said Christopher Rolland, a senior equity analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. Beijing took steps during the weekend to revive shares following a 30 percent slide in its stock market since mid-June, which raised investors’ concerns about the stability of the Chinese economy. Among the companies with the biggest exposure to China are Qualcomm and fellow chipmaker Broadcom Corp BRCM.O, which depend on China for 50 percent and 24 percent of their overall revenue, respectively.  Qualcomm declined to comment ahead of its earnings announcement, and a Broadcom representative was not immediately available to comment. Apple declined to comment.  China’s stock market stumble comes as the chip sector was already facing a tough year. Research firm Gartner said it is downgrading its assessment of worldwide semiconductor sales, which it had initially expected to reach $354 billion this year, a 4 percent increase from 2014, although it has not yet released its new assessment. However, the situation may not be as dire as the revenue numbers indicate. Exposure to China may be smaller than the companies’ reports suggest, according to Cody Acree, an analyst for Ascendiant Capital Markets.  For instance, Cirrus Logic Inc (CRUS.O), which supplies integrated circuits for audio and automotive applications, reports that it made nearly 80 percent of its revenue in China last year.  But the company said the number represents where its products are manufactured and not necessarily the end-market where products are sold. The company said it did not currently see any impact on its business.

510,QCOM,Qualcomm faces EU antitrust probes over tactics to block rivals,"BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators are investigating whether one of the world’s biggest chipmakers, Qualcomm, uses illegal tactics to shut out rivals, six years after slapping a record 1 billion euro ($1.09 billion) fine on Intel for a similar offense. Qualcomm has been feeling the heat from regulators in Europe, the United States, China, Japan and South Korea in recent years in relation to its licensing model and the power of its patents in mobile networks and communications devices. The U.S. company agreed in February to pay a fine of $975 million to end a 14-month investigation by the Chinese government into anti-competitive practices.  The European Commission said on Thursday it was launching twin probes into the San Diego-based chip designer which center on its control of baseband components used in most of the world’s smartphones, including Apple iPhones. One investigation will look into whether Qualcomm offered financial incentives to customers for baseband chips that form the core of the latest 4G phones and tablets, on condition that they bought exclusively or almost exclusively from Qualcomm. The second will look at whether Qualcomm engaged in “predatory pricing” by charging at less than cost with a view to forcing competitors out of the market.  The second probe was triggered by a complaint from British phone software maker Icera, which later was acquired by Nvidia Corp in a bid to enter the market for smartphone chips and compete with Qualcomm.  “We are launching these investigations because we want to be sure that high-tech suppliers can compete on the merits of their products,” European Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said in a statement. “Many customers use electronic devices, such as a mobile phone or a tablet, and we want to ensure that they ultimately get value for money.” Qualcomm, which faces a fine of up to 10 percent of its global  turnover if found guilty of breaching EU rules, said it was disappointed to hear of the new EU investigations. “We have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with the Commission, and we continue to believe that any concerns are without merit,” it said in a statement. The Commission is expected to seek information from Intel, Broadcom, Marvell, MediaTek, Renesas and the former ST-Ericsson joint venture as part of its investigations. As recently as 2009, the market for mobile baseband chips was teaming with competitors, but many established names have since quit. The components are key to allowing the latest 4G phones to ship data at high speeds without sapping batteries.  Texas Instruments, Broadcom, Freescale and ST-Ericsson have all exited this specific category in recent years to focus on other sectors.  Graphics chip maker Nvidia, which paid $367 million in 2011 to acquire Icera, acknowledged in May that it had failed to make inroads into the market and that it would wind down its Icera business, if it could not find a buyer. More than 500 jobs, mostly in Britain and France, could be lost. Nvidia declined to comment on the EU investigations. In 2009 the EU closed, without taking further action, a two-year antitrust probe into whether Qualcomm charged unreasonably high royalties for technology that was an integral part of global 3G phone standards.

521,QCOM,"Qualcomm slashes jobs and costs, says may split itself up","(Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) said it may break itself up as it delivered its third profit warning this year and announced plans to slash jobs and spending in the face of rising competition. The company said it would reduce costs by about $1.4 billion, cut about 4,500 full-time staff, or 15 percent of its workforce, and boost capital returns to shareholders. Qualcomm shares fell 1.8 percent to $63.05 in after-market trading on Wednesday. The stock has lost a fifth of its value in a year. The move comes after hedge fund Jana Partners called for Qualcomm to spin off its chip business from its highly profitable patent-licensing income, among other changes the activist asked for. “We decided we were going to take a fresh look at the corporate structure of the company,” Qualcomm president Derek Aberle said in an interview, adding that the chipmaker has reviewed its options twice already in the past decade.  “The environment is constantly changing so the analysis  done earlier may not be valid anymore, so it’s in that context that we’re taking a look at it again now,” Aberle said. The company said it expected to complete its strategic review by the end of the year and also agreed to add three new board members in cooperation with the activist. For the review, Qualcomm is being advised by investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Evercore Partners Inc (EVR.N), according to people familiar with the matter. Qualcomm’s Aberle added that M&A; in the semiconductor industry is at a “heightened level.”  Semiconductor dealmaking has reached $79.7 billion so far this year, the highest level since 2000.  Qualcomm makes software and chips used in smartphones, tablets and gaming devices and is known for its Snapdragon processor used in high-end smartphones made by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), HTC Corp (2498.TW) and ZTE Corp (000063.SZ). It faces intense competition from Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc (2454.TW) and a handful of small Chinese companies that specialize in making chips for low-priced phones. This year, Samsung said it would use its own processor for the new Galaxy S6 smartphone instead of Snapdragon. Qualcomm agreed in February to pay a fine of $975 million to the Chinese government’s National Development and Reform Commission for anti-competitive practices.. The company cut both its full-year revenue forecast and the outlook for its semiconductor business.

522,QCOM,"UPDATE 5-Qualcomm slashes jobs and costs, says may split itself up","* Says will cut costs by about $1.4 billion * To cut about 15 percent of workforce, or 4,500 jobs * Lowers full-year forecast for third time this year   (Adds quotes from interview with company president) By Lehar Maan and Liana B. Baker July 22 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc said it may break itself up as it delivered its third profit warning this year and announced plans to slash jobs and spending in the face of rising competition. The company said it would reduce costs by about $1.4 billion, cut about 4,500 full-time staff, or 15 percent of its workforce, and boost capital returns to shareholders. Qualcomm shares fell 1.8 percent to $63.05 in after-market trading on Wednesday. The stock has lost a fifth of its value in a year. The move comes after hedge fund Jana Partners called for Qualcomm to spin off its chip business from its highly profitable patent-licensing income, among other changes the activist asked for. “We decided we were going to take a fresh look at the corporate structure of the company,” Qualcomm president Derek Aberle said in an interview, adding that the chipmaker has reviewed its options twice already in the past decade. “The environment is constantly changing so the analysis  done earlier may not be valid anymore, so it’s in that context that we’re taking a look at it again now,” Aberle said. The company said it expected to complete its strategic review by the end of the year and also agreed to add three new board members in cooperation with the activist. For the review, Qualcomm is being advised by investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Evercore Partners Inc , according to people familiar with the matter. Qualcomm’s Aberle added that M&A; in the semiconductor industry is at a “heightened level.” Semiconductor dealmaking has reached $79.7 billion so far this year, the highest level since 2000. Qualcomm makes software and chips used in smartphones, tablets and gaming devices and is known for its Snapdragon processor used in high-end smartphones made by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp and ZTE Corp . It faces intense competition from Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc  and a handful of small Chinese companies that specialize in making chips for low-priced phones. This year, Samsung said it would use its own processor for the new Galaxy S6 smartphone instead of Snapdragon. Qualcomm agreed in February to pay a fine of $975 million to the Chinese government’s National Development and Reform Commission for anti-competitive practices.. The company cut both its full-year revenue forecast and the outlook for its semiconductor business. Revenue fell 14.3 percent to $5.83 billion in the third quarter - the first quarterly fall in five years - and missed the average analyst estimate of $5.85 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

523,QCOM,"RPT-UPDATE 1-Qualcomm says may split itself, cut jobs","(Repeats to fix format) July 22 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc said it may break itself up as it delivered its third profit warning this year and announced plans to slash jobs and spending. The company said it would cut costs by about $1.4 billion and reduce its full-time workforce by 15 percent, in the face of strong competition from China and Taiwan. Qualcomm’s shares fell about 1 percent at $63.50 in after-market trading on Wednesday. The chipmaker, which has about 30,000 employees worldwide, also said it had agreed with Jana Partners to add two of the hedge fund’s nominees to Qualcomm’s board. Jana had been pushing for Qualcomm to spin off its chip business from its highly profitable patent-licensing business. Qualcomm also said it may return capital to shareholders. The company is facing intense competition from Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc and a handful of small Chinese companies that specialize in making chips for low-priced phones. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that Qualcomm was considering splitting itself up. Qualcomm, which makes software and chips used in smartphones, tablets and gaming devices, is known for its Snapdragon processor used in high-end smartphones made by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp and ZTE Corp.

Qualcomm said it would hire outside financial advisers for its strategic review, which it expected to complete by the end of the year. The Information website also reported on Monday that the chipmaker was preparing to lay off several thousand employees. Qualcomm cut its full-year revenue forecast to $24.5 billion-$25.5 billion from $25 billion-$27 billion and cut its adjusted profit forecast to $4.50-$4.70 per share from $4.60-$5.00 per share.

525,QCOM,$5.7 billion wiped off European tech shares after Apple outlook disappoints,"LONDON (Reuters) - Top European technology stocks shed nearly $6 billion of market value on Wednesday, with suppliers for Apple the top fallers after the tech giant’s revenue forecasts fell short of expectations. While the worst hit were the handful with 20-70 percent direct exposure, the whole sector suffered as investors cautioned against frothy valuations, with the STOXX Europe 600 tech index .SX8P trading well above its historical average. The European technology index lost 5.7 billion dollars of market capitalization, led lower by a 6.5 percent slump in Germany’s Dialog Semiconductors and a 5.1 percent fall in British-listed ARM Holdings ARM.L.  Apple orders accounted for around 70-75 percent of Dialog’s total revenue, industry experts said, while Apple accounted for 20-25 percent of ARM’s processor royalties last year. While Apple’s biggest suppliers, such as Intel (INTC.O) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O), are American, Apple is a large customer of many smaller European companies. Dialog, which makes chips for Apple, lost $287 million, while ARM, which licenses chip designs for use in Apple products, saw $1.7 billion knocked off its value. Dialog remains up 67 percent so far this year, and trades at valuations over 15 percent higher than its historical averages. “We have nothing against Apple, but expectations on that side of the market are a little bit too high and that the reason we now don’t have any Apple-related stocks,” said Anko Beldsnijder, managing director of MainFirst Asset Management. Austria’s Ams AG fell 2.9 percent. Its technology is used in the Apple watch, though in June a Swiss newspaper reported it would miss out on a valuable new Apple contract.  Shares in European companies with smaller direct exposure to Apple such as Infineon (IFXGn.DE) and STMicro (STM.PA) also fell by around 5 percent, with investors saying sentiment around technology stocks in general had turned negative. The STOXX Europe tech index trades at a price of 18.7 times its 12-month forward earnings, against a 10-year average of 16.2 times, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. It trades at a premium to every other sector apart from telecoms and healthcare stocks. Tech consultancy Gartner said in April it forecast a 4 percent rise in semiconductor sales worldwide in 2015 but warned that stronger dollar, excess inventories and end of PC upgrade cycle were seeing “mounting concerns”. ARM’s drop came as the chip-designer’s reported results that were broadly in line with expectations, saying that Apple’s outlook would not change its view of second half trading. Veronika Pechlaner, fund manager at Ashburton, said the resilience of royalties from Apple last quarter was a good sign, and that ARM had enough other diverse streams of revenue to withstand a slight Apple slowdown. “Looking at the share price now, we could be nearing a buying opportunity. We still like ARM in the longer term, even in the context of weaker Apple earnings, as there are lots of opportunities outside handheld devices,” Pechlaner said. She added that Dialog would be more sensitive to Apple sales, and that after today’s fall investors would reconsider their position in the stock in the coming days. “We still own it, it’s a question of whether we still want to continue to own it, whether we add to it here, or if the Apple concentration is a problem in the longer term. It’s definitely a stock to revisit after this.” ",7222015,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-europe-tech/5-7-billion-wiped-off-european-tech-shares-after-apple-outlook-disappoints-idUSKCN0PW1P120150722
526,QCOM,Qualcomm's potential break-up could lead to courtship with Intel,"(Reuters) - It could be a match made in heaven. Wall Street says Intel Corp is the best suitor for Qualcomm Inc’s chip unit, if the maker of Snapdragon mobile processors decides to break itself up. “The chip deal to end all chip deals,” says Cowen and Co analyst Timothy Arcuri, would give Intel’s smartphone chip making business a much-needed boost. It would also allow Intel to expand its footprint in the key Chinese market. Other suitors for Qualcomm’s chip business, valued at $30 billion-$40 billion, could include a consortium backed by the Chinese government and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Qualcomm said on Wednesday that it was weighing a possible separation of its two businesses, a move prompted by activist shareholder Jana Partners, which had a 1.7 percent stake in the company as of March 31. The maker of computing and communication chips for mobile devices has been losing ground to Asian rivals such as MediaTek Inc, whose cheaper versions have given them an edge in the price-conscious Asian market. Longtime customer Samsung’s decision to use its own chips in its flagship Galaxy S6 smartphone instead of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon has added to the company’s woes. A deal with Intel, which has its own foundries, will help Qualcomm cut costs and price its chips more competitively. “... This would catapult Intel into the leadership position and give it diversity away from PCs that it very much needs,” Ascendiant Capital Markets analyst Cody Acree said. Intel and Qualcomm declined to comment. Cowen’s Timothy Arcuri said the business could be worth about $20 per share — less than a third of Qualcomm’s current share price — and Intel could offer $25 per share.     But Arcuri and several other analysts are not sure a split makes sense in the first place. Qualcomm funnels licensing profits into the chip business and a possible split raises questions about the unit’s ability to sustain itself as an independent entity. “... We worry that the loss of its golden goose would seriously harm (the chip unit’s) ability to dramatically out-spend competitors on research and development,” Arcuri said. Drexel Hamilton analyst Richard Whittington said Qualcomm was unlikely to go through with the split, but if it did, Intel would be a good fit. “I can’t see how they can possibly segregate the two. Whatever short term gain is derived, would be more than made up with permanent loss of market share in ... two to three years,” he said, adding that Qualcomm could instead look to partner with Intel or smaller Chinese and Korean companies.

A Tsinghua Holdings spokeswoman confirmed Xu’s comments to the newspaper. Tsinghua Holdings, which is backed by Tsinghua University in Beijing, has emerged as a champion of Chinese technology in recent years as the country tries to shed its reliance on foreign industrial science. Its private equity subsidiary, Tsinghua Unigroup, is in talks to buy U.S. chipmaker Micro Technology Inc for $23 billion in what could be the biggest Chinese takeover of a U.S. company. Xu said in the interview that a certain proportion of the 30 billion yuan sum would come from government funding and its partners. Tsinghua Unigroup in February said it had received 10 billion yuan from the government to invest in chip companies. “Frankly, compared with global competitors, we are still three-to-five years behind in technology, especially in cutting-edge 4G and 5G products,” he said. “But if we don’t close the technology gap, we will never win.”   ($1 = 6.3232 Chinese yuan renminbi)   (Reporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Stephen Coates)",8122015,http://www.reuters.com/article/tsinghuaholdings-tech/chinas-tsinghua-to-invest-4-7-bln-in-mobile-chips-china-daily-idUSL5N10N00920150812

537,QCOM,Qualcomm president says splitting company may not create value,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc’s (QCOM.O) President Derek Aberle, under pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners to improve the licensing and chip design firm’s stock performance, on Thursday sounded a cautionary note about a potential breakup of the company. Stressing that the board and management do not expect to  complete a review of a possible split until the end of the year,  Aberle told Reuters that Qualcomm agrees with Jana that its stock is undervalued. Shares have fallen 25 percent over the past 12 months, whereas the S&P; 500 is down 2.25 percent.  Aberle said that investors calling for a split are taking a “sum of the parts” analysis and believe that Qualcomm’s two divisions  - its highly profitable licensing arm and its chips unit - would be valued more highly as independent companies.  “You have to step back and say why is that and would a separation actually solve whatever the underlying issues are that are creating the current valuation?,” he said. “You have to be careful that it’s not too simplistic an analysis.” The company’s current structure, Aberle said, also allows Qualcomm to leverage relationships with Chinese customers, since the chipmaker is well-positioned to help them expand to other countries.  At the same time, Aberle acknowledged that having both a chips and licensing division has at times created conflicts with customers, “but we manage it pretty well.”   Jana in April unleashed a public campaign to reform Qualcomm, calling its chip business “essentially worthless” at current valuations and pressing the company to spin it off or pursue strategic mergers or acquisitions. Aberle said that when Qualcomm was approached by Jana, the hedge fund which owned $2 billion in stock did not pressure it to pursue a breakup but rather wanted them to review a split as one option to unlock value.  It is also working on adding a third independent board member, whom Aberle declined to name. Qualcomm has already added two new board members in cooperation with Jana. “A lot of the things (Jana) put on the table were very consistent with things we’d already been talking to our shareholders about and already been planning for a long time,” Aberle said.

539,QCOM,China woes hurt chipmaker Qualcomm's profit forecast,"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) forecast first-quarter profit way below analysts’ expectations as the chipmaker struggles against fierce competition from Chinese and Taiwanese rivals, and faces delays in closing new licensing agreements in China. The company’s shares fell nearly 6 percent in extended trading on Wednesday. Qualcomm’s agreements with two major Chinese customers are taking longer than anticipated, Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said on a conference call.  President Derek Aberle said some Chinese customers were “improperly withholding” royalties on Qualcomm’s patents by changing the way they report sales.  The company, which got half of its fiscal 2014 revenue from Chinese customers, said it expected the issue to be resolved once the new agreements were completed.  Qualcomm is in the middle of a strategic review after hedge fund Jana Partners urged it to separate its chip unit from its highly profitable patent-licensing business.  The company has also announced job cuts and other cost-cutting steps in the face of stiff competition, which is likely to intensify as chipmakers consolidate to meet demand for cheaper semiconductors and to diversify their portfolios.  Qualcomm said on Wednesday that demand for the new version of its flagship Snapdragon mobile chips was stronger than it had expected in the fourth quarter.  The company was hurt earlier this year by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd’s (005930.KS) decision to use an internally developed processor, instead of the Snapdragon chips, in its Galaxy S6 smartphones.  Samsung had not ruled out using Qualcomm’s chips in the future and media reported last month that the South Korean company’s Galaxy S7 phones for the U.S. and China markets were expected to use Snapdragon 820 chips.

547,QCOM,"Qualcomm decides against breakup, says current structure best","(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc has decided not to split into separate chipmaking and technology licensing businesses, concluding a six-month strategic review instigated by hedge fund Jana Partners. San Diego-based Qualcomm, the biggest maker of chips used in mobile phones, said on Tuesday its current structure offered unique strategic benefits that cannot be replicated. Qualcomm, whose earnings have slumped by more than 40 percent in each of the last three quarters, said it had “a focused plan” in place that it believed would drive growth. Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf did not elaborate. The company has also said all along that its existing structure allowed it to leverage relationships with Chinese customers, which are expanding quickly into other countries. Jana, which owned about 28.6 million Qualcomm shares as of Sept. 30, is comfortable with Qualcomm’s decision and supportive of the board’s efforts, people familiar with the matter said. Qualcomm said business in the current quarter was stronger than expected as 3G and 4G device shipments were helping its licensing business and cost cuts were taking hold. The chipmaker said it now expected earnings per share for the quarter to be at or modestly above the high end of its forecast range. The company had forecast earnings of 80-90 cents per share for the quarter. The technology licensing business has driven Qualcomm’s profits for years, thanks to the royalties it collects on the chip-technology developed by its chipmaking unit. “I think it’s better that they didn’t split. I’m happy about that,” Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said. Qualcomm can continue to outsource hardware manufacturing  without having to go through a split, he said. Some analysts expressed surprise that Qualcomm did not come up with any value-boosting plans. “We have a hard time believing that keeping the status quo will help the stock rebound,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long wrote in a note. Qualcomm’s shares, which have fallen almost 40 percent this year, were up 3.3 percent at $47.39 in late morning trading. The special committee that carried out the review included two members nominated by Jana, which unleashed a public campaign to reform Qualcomm in April. Mollenkopf, on an analysts’ call, said acquisitions were  considered as part of the review. Chipmakers have raced to merge this year as they seek to meet demand for cheaper chips and to diversify their offerings to adapt to new trends such as the “Internet of Things.” Feinseth said Qualcomm should also join the fray, buying, for example, Apple supplier Skyworks Solutions Inc.

550,QCOM,Samsung Electronics to produce new Qualcomm chips in blow to TSMC,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc said on Thursday Samsung Electronics Co Ltd will become the sole manufacturer of its new flagship mobile chip, a major boost for the South Korean tech giant as it vies for deals with bigger rival TSMC. The deal, which some analysts estimate is worth over $1 billion, comes as Samsung, a major Apple Inc supplier, is heading into another profit drop this year due to slowing demand for consumer electronics and components. “This is very significant because never before has Qualcomm used foundries other than TSMC to make high-end chipsets,” Maybank Kim Eng analyst Warren Lau said. Samsung could gain more than $1 billion in revenue from the Snapdragon 820 orders at its Taiwanese rival’s expense, he said. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), which has counted Qualcomm as its top customer, said on Thursday it expected falling demand in high-end smartphones in the current quarter after posting a better than expected quarterly profit. Qualcomm said in a separate e-mail statement to Reuters that Samsung was the sole manufacturer for the new Snapdragon 820 mobile processors. Though Qualcomm’s order alone will not rejuvenate Samsung’s earnings, the deal suggests gathering momentum in the Korean firm’s efforts to grow its foundry business to diversify its revenue stream.  The firm is relying more on components such as chips and displays as rivals Apple and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] undercut sales and margins of the world’s top smartphone maker.  TSMC dwarfs Samsung’s foundry business in terms of revenue, but the two firms are competing fiercely for orders from high-end customers including Apple Inc. Samsung’s 14-nanometre technology has helped the firm gain ground against TSMC and pick up new clients.  Maybank Kim Eng’s Lau said Qualcomm would likely increase orders to Samsung for other Snapdragon chips that would launch later this year, and it would be a key client once the South Korean firm started mass production based on the 10-nanometre technology under development. Qualcomm’s orders could also attract more customers away from TSMC to Samsung, he said.  Smaller chips reduce power consumption, improve performance and lower costs by allowing more to fit on a single wafer. Samsung said the Snapdragon 820 used its 14-nanometre manufacturing process, which it also used to make its own Exynos processors.

The company, whose customers include Apple Inc, said it expected its mobile chip shipments to fall by 16-25 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. Qualcomm also expects 3G and 4G device shipments to decline by 4-14 percent, hurting its licensing revenue.  The chipmaker’s weak outlook comes a day after Apple forecast its first quarterly revenue drop in 13 years and reported the slowest-ever rise in iPhone shipments as the critical Chinese market shows signs of weakness. Qualcomm shares fell 3 percent in extended trading on Wednesday.  The company trimmed its estimates for “premium tier shipments” due to “slower than expected sell-through at a large” customer, it said on a post-earnings conference call.   Qualcomm’s mobile chip shipments fell 10 percent in the first quarter, pulling down its equipment and services revenue by 21.6 percent.  Revenue from licensing declined 10.4 percent.  “I think on licensing it’s getting really fuzzy; they’re not suggesting any upside to licensing, which I think is what people really wanted to see before getting excited in the stock again,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told Reuters.  Qualcomm said in December it had decided not to split its slowing chipmaking business from its technology licensing business. Qualcomm forecast an adjusted profit of 90 cents to $1.00 per share for the second quarter, below the average analyst estimate of $1.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Revenue from licensing declined 10.4 percent.  “I think on licensing it’s getting really fuzzy; they’re not suggesting any upside to licensing, which I think is what people really wanted to see before getting excited in the stock again,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon told Reuters.  Qualcomm said in December it had decided not to split its slowing chipmaking business from its technology licensing business. Qualcomm forecast an adjusted profit of 90 cents to $1.00 per share for the second quarter, below the average analyst estimate of $1.01, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its revenue forecast of $4.9 billion-$5.7 billion was also largely below analysts’ expectations of $5.68 billion.  The net income attributable to Qualcomm fell 24 percent to $1.50 billion, or 99 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 27. (1.usa.gov/1OQ64UT) Excluding items, the company earned 97 cents per share, topping the average analyst estimate of 90 cents, as it aggressively slashed costs.  Revenue fell 18.7 percent to $5.78 billion. Qualcomm shares were trading at $47.07 after the bell. Up to Wednesday’s close, the stock had lost a third of its value in the past 12 months.

559,QCOM,U.S. fines Qualcomm for hiring relatives of China officials -SEC,"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc has agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle charges it violated U.S. anti-bribery laws by hiring relatives of Chinese officials to obtain business, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Tuesday. The Chinese officials related to Qualcomm’s new hires were deciding whether to select the company’s mobile technology products amid growing competition in the global telecommunications market, the SEC said. The conduct, which included offering jobs to some individuals who fell short of hiring standards at the San Diego-based telecommunications company, occurred between 2002 and 2012, the SEC said. Qualcomm, which neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s findings, had previously disclosed the SEC probe, the company said in a statement. Qualcomm has taken additional steps to enhance its existing internal controls and procedures, it said. The case is part of an SEC crackdown involving the hiring of “princelings,” the term used in Asia to refer to the children or younger relatives of China’s political leaders or top executives at state-owned enterprises. The practice could potentially violate U.S. anti-bribery laws. HSBC , Europe’s biggest lender, disclosed on Feb. 22 that the SEC was also investigating its hiring practices in Asia. The SEC had also opened a probe into JPMorgan  in 2013 regarding the hiring of princelings. Improper hiring by Qualcomm included a situation in 2010, when a manager at a Chinese state-owned telecommunications company asked Qualcomm employees to find an internship at Qualcomm for her daughter. A Qualcomm employee noted the girl’s parents gave “great help” for Qualcomm’s business development, the SEC said in a settlement. In another instance, Qualcomm gave financial support to the son of an executive at another state-owned company through a $75,000 research grant to an American university where he studied. The measure allowed the son to renew his student visa and retain his position in a PhD program. The Chinese executive’s son was later a Qualcomm intern and then permanently employed, despite being deemed a “no hire” after company interviews. A Qualcomm executive later personally loaned the employee $70,000 to buy a home. Qualcomm now closely monitors employment referrals to determine if candidates have relationships with employees of state-owned entities or government, the company said. It applies a stricter scrutiny to avoid potential future anti-bribery law risks, the company said. The SEC also found that Qualcomm provided gifts, travel, and entertainment to try to influence officials at government-owned telecom companies in China. Qualcomm lacked sufficient internal controls to detect those payments and misrepresented them in the company’s books and records as legitimate business expenses, the SEC said.",3012016,http://www.reuters.com/article/qualcomm-corruption/u-s-fines-qualcomm-for-hiring-relatives-of-china-officials-sec-idUSL2N1691LY

568,QCOM,Qualcomm profit forecast misses estimates as chip shipments drop,"(Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) forecast third-quarter profit below analysts estimates as it expects to ship fewer chips, including those for smartphones, its biggest business. The company’s shares dropped 3 percent to $50.50 in after market trading on Wednesday, having earlier oscillated between slight gains and losses. Qualcomm, whose customers include Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), said it expects chip shipments to fall 13-22 percent to 175-195 million in the current quarter. The company said it expects 3G and 4G device shipments increase to 8 percent at the midpoint in this quarter, lower than its previous estimate of about 10 percent growth. Besides slowing smartphone sales, Qualcomm is also being squeezed by competitors making chips that rival its own in price and performance, and the likes of Samsung and Apple increasingly making their own components for smartphones. Qualcomm said it expects to earn between 90 cents and $1.00 per share in the third quarter. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Research firm Gartner expects global smartphone sales to grow in single digits in percentage terms for the first time ever this year, while Apple in January also forecast its first revenue drop in 13 years. The uncertainty in the smartphone business seemed to show in the company’s third-quarter revenue forecast of $5.2-$6.0 billion, which implies revenue could be between 11 percent lower and 3 percent higher than the year-ago quarter. However, while Qualcomm’s chip business is the bigger contributor to revenue, the San Diego-based company’s business of licensing its chip technology is the bigger driver of profit. But here too the company has faced delays in closing licensing agreements in China, its biggest market. Qualcomm, which has recently signed new deals with several companies including Lenovo, said on Wednesday it was still in talks with key Chinese smartphone makers to sign agreements. Revenue at Qualcomm’s chipmaking division and its licensing business fell, 25 percent and 12 percent respectively, in the latest quarter, dragging down total revenue for the fourth quarter in a row. However, the 19.5 percent drop, to $5.55 billion, in the three months ended March 27, was less than the nearly 23 percent drop analysts were expecting.

577,QCOM,Qualcomm files complaint in China court against smartphone maker Meizu,"June 24 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc has filed a complaint in a Chinese court against smartphone maker Meizu Technology Co after the tech giant said it was unable to reach a licensing accord with one of the top 10 handset suppliers in its biggest market. The filing by San Diego-based Qualcomm, submitted to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday, is the first legal action by Qualcomm as it seeks to uphold terms of its landmark 2015 anti-trust settlement with China’s economic policy panel, the National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC). Qualcomm agreed to pay a fine of $975 million in the settlement, the largest in China’s corporate history. The complaint against Meizu asks the court to affirm that Qualcomm’s terms for a patent license agreement complies with China’s anti-monopoly law and the company’s fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory licensing obligations under its 2015 remediation agreement with the NDRC, the company said. Reuters could not immediately contact officials at Meizu for comment. Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, said in a telephone interview that the firm has negotiated extensively and in good faith with Meizu to sign a patent license agreement consistent with the terms of the rectification plan submitted by Qualcomm to, and accepted by the NDRC. “There’s no question that Qualcomm’s intellectual property has been used and we have not been properly paid,” Rosenberg said. He said Qualcomm was not focused on damages, but on leveling the playing field for everyone in China. Meizu, located in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, was China’s eighth-biggest smartphone maker in 2015, shipping 24.82 million devices for the year, according to IDC data. China is Qualcomm’s most important market, making up 53 percent of global revenue of $25.28 billion for the fiscal year ended Sept. 27, with a large chunk of profit coming from higher-margin royalties earned from the company’s licensing arm. As part of its 2015 settlement with the NRDC, Qualcomm agreed to a plan that modified its business practices in China. The company has since signed more than 100 Chinese handset manufacturers to licensing agreements under the new terms, but has said it continues to struggle with a handful of key original equipment manufacturers. “We remain in active discussions with the few key Chinese OEMs that have not yet signed and believe we are making progress in those discussions,” Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said on a telephone conference call in April. Qualcomm has also been seeking to deepen its presence in the Chinese market by transferring technology and investing in next-generation chip manufacturing.

583,QCOM,Strong demand from China buoys Qualcomm forecast,"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc forecast current-quarter profit largely above market estimates as it sees strong demand for its mobile chips in China and expects to sign more licensing deals. Shares of the company, which also posted a better-than-expected third-quarter profit, rose about 7 percent in extended trading on Wednesday. “We are seeing incremental demand for our lower-tier chip sets in China versus our prior expectations,” Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said on a call with analysts.

Qualcomm expects to launch Snapdragon 821, an advanced and a faster version of Snapdragon 820, which powers Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge smartphones. “I think it is pretty straightforward...Samsung is back as their customer and...more people in China are ready to pay to license their technology...so it looks like the company is well positioned for the coming quarters,” said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy. The company said it expects fiscal year revenue in its high-margin licensing business to be between $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion. The chipmaker’s next big bet is the fast next-generation 5G technology, a wireless service that is expected to be 100 times faster than the current 4G networks. The company said it now expects to gain traction in the 5G technology by 2018-2019. U.S. regulators last week paved way to open spectrum for the 5G wireless service. The San Diego-based chipmaker said it expected to earn $1.05 to $1.15 per share in the fourth quarter, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $1.08, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also forecast revenue between $5.4 billion and $6.2 billion. Analysts were expecting about $5.73 billion. The company, which has been struggling with slowing smartphone sales and stiff competition from Chinese and Taiwanese rivals, reported its first revenue rise in five quarters. Revenue rose to $6.04 billion quarter ended June 26 from $5.83 billion a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.16 cents per share, compared with analysts estimate of 97 cents.

The deal would help diversify Qualcomm’s business and make it a bigger supplier to the automotive industry. Talks are in the early stages and NXP may entertain other offers, should they emerge, according to one of the sources.   An agreement with Qualcomm could be struck in the next two to three months, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported news of the talks.  Representatives for Netherlands-based NXP and San Diego-based Qualcomm declined to comment.  NXP shares rose 16.9 percent to close at $96.12 on Thursday, while Qualcomm’s rose 6.3 percent to $67.45.  NXP closed a nearly $12 billion deal to buy U.S.-based Freescale Semiconductor last December, creating the world’s top maker of automotive electronics and doubling the percentage of its auto-related revenue to 40 percent. It could also attract interest from other large semiconductor companies such as Broadcom and Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O), analysts have said.  Qualcomm, which supplies Android smartphone makers and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), has been dealing with slowing smartphone sales and stiff competition from Chinese and Taiwanese rivals. Qualcomm has so far sat out the transformative consolidation sweeping the industry, which has seen mega-deals such as Avago (AVGO.O)  buying Broadcom for $37 billion last year.  Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from chip sales but most of its profit comes from wireless patents it licenses to the mobile industry. It explored a plan to break up its chip business from its patent licensing unit after pressure from activist investor Jana Partners but decided to remain whole.  Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said that the deal would give Qualcomm a roadmap for the next decade while moving away from a maturing handset market and toward the faster growing opportunity in automotives.  Qualcomm was ranked third in terms of revenue among global semiconductor companies in 2015, while NXP ranked No. 7, according to research firm IHS.  RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said the potential deal would be accretive to Qualcomm, which could also use offshore cash. “Assuming a reasonable valuation is paid, this would be an attractive acquisition for Qualcomm and a good use of $30 billion in cash Qualcomm currently has on their balance sheet,” Daryanani said.

Elliott said in a filing Thursday it had initiated a dialogue with the board of directors after taking a roughly $200 million stake in the company. Elliott’s broad range of investments across the tech industry are overseen by portfolio manager Jesse Cohn, who also leads its private equity investing arm, Evergreen, based in Menlo Park, California.

With the deal, Qualcomm is taking a big bet on the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), which enables everyday objects such as fridges and cars to communicate with each other. “The pace of innovation in automobile and IoT will increase dramatically and I think we look at it as a tremendous opportunity,” Qualcomm Chief Executive Steven Mollenkopf said on a conference call. By 2020, some 21 billion IoT devices will be in use worldwide, up from fewer than 5 billion last year, research firm Gartner has estimated. Qualcomm sat out the transformative consolidation that has swept the chip industry recently.  The deal announced on Thursday tops Avago’s $37 billion acquisition of Broadcom (AVGO.O) last year. The equity value of Qualcomm’s offer is $37.88 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on the company’s fully diluted shares as of Oct. 2. Including debt, the deal is worth roughly $47 billion. Qualcomm’s shares were up 4.9 percent at $71.55 in afternoon trading. The $110 per share cash offer represents a premium of 11.5 percent to NXP’s Wednesday close. NXP’s shares, which had risen 20 percent since reports of a potential deal emerged on Sept. 29, were marginally higher at $99.24.   Qualcomm said it expected the deal to clear regulatory scrutiny, given the complimentary nature of the two businesses. Needham & Co analyst Rajvindra Gill said there was not much overlap in products or end-markets between the two companies. “There’s been a lot of semiconductor M&A; activity in the last two years and I haven’t seen one deal that has been delayed because of regulatory hurdles at this point,” Gill added. The combined entity would have annual revenue of more than $30 billion. NXP, based in the Netherlands, became the world’s biggest maker of automotive electronics after it bought U.S.-based Freescale Semiconductor for about $12 billion last December. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have committed financing for the deal, which is expected to close by the end of 2017. The deal is structured to use offshore cash flow in a tax-efficient manner to rapidly reduce leverage, Qualcomm said. The company said it expected the deal to generate $500 million in cost savings annually within two years of closing. Goldman Sachs and Evercore were financial advisers to Qualcomm, while Centerview Partners LLC advised its board. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP; Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP and Allen & Overy LLP were legal counsel to Qualcomm. Qatalyst Partners, Barclays and Credit Suisse were financial advisers to NXP and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP and De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek provided legal advice.

620,QCOM,UPDATE 1-UK misses out in end-of-year recovery for M&A; deals,"LONDON (Reuters) - The value of merger and acquisition deals between UK companies has plunged 62 percent to a 30-year low since the country’s vote to leave the European Union, according to Thomson Reuters data. Domestic deals in Britain since the June 23 referendum have totaled just $1 billion the data shows.  Foreign purchases of British firms have also slumped 69 percent, according to the figures, despite a sharply weaker pound. That stands in contrast to a burst of dealmaking in the United States and the rest of Europe, which has lifted bankers’ hopes for a Christmas fee bonanza after an otherwise mediocre year for M&A; globally.  AT&T;’s (T.N)’s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner (TWX.N), Qualcomm’s (QCOM.O) $38.5 billion buy of Dutch chip  maker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) and GE Oil & Gas’s $32 billion merger with Baker Hughes BHI.N are expected to earn bankers advising on these deals $475.91 million in fees, data compiled by Thomson Reuters and Freeman & Co show.   Those deals, announced in the past month, have pushed global fees earned from completed mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) to stand at $21 billion so far this year, down 7 percent on the same period in 2015. Last year was a record year for dealmaking globally with several large deals involving UK-listed companies, like Anheuser-Busch Inbev’s (ABI.BR) $110.3 billion acquisition of SABMiller and Shell’s (RDSa.L) $53 billion takeover of BG Group.      Softbank’s (9984.T) $30.7 billion acquisition of UK-based chip designer ARM Holdings in July had sparked hopes among bankers that the fall in sterling might lead to more deals, but few others have materialized so far.     Goldman Sachs remains the biggest earner globally according to Thomson Reuters. But the stand-out performer has been pure advisory firm Lazard (LAZ.N), which is the top fee-earner in Europe so far this year. If it retains that position by the end of 2016 it will be the first time in the 15 years that the data has been collated that it has clinched the top spot.  Lazard advised Tyco International on its $16.5 billion merger with Johnson Controls and also worked with ARM Holdings on the Softbank deal. Globally, Lazard ranked fourth both in terms of fees from completed deals and the number of announced deals so far this year, challenging large American bulge bracket banks which also get M&A; credit for lending money to their clients.  Companies over the past few years have increasingly turned to so-called “boutique” pure advisory firms which are seen as more independent in their advice than universal lending banks.  Another pure-play advisory firm, Rothschild (ROTH.PA), ranked number two for European fees and number six globally, the data showed. Among the bulge bracket firms, UBS is set for a record year after advising Swiss chemical firm Syngenta on its $43 billion deal with Chemchina. The Swiss bank ranks at number two for announced deals so far this year in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), just behind Goldman Sachs.  But its European rival Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), which is in the middle of a strategic overhaul as it risks a multi-billion fine from U.S. regulator, has been struggling, falling from sixth to tenth globally on announced deals so far this year, the data showed.

629,QCOM,"Microsoft, Qualcomm back Israel's Team8 cybersecurity firm","TEL AVIV (Reuters) - The venture arms of Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O) have invested in Team8, an Israeli creator of cybersecurity start-ups, as big multinational companies get behind Israel’s burgeoning cyber industry in the face of growing threats. Team8, which also announced on Monday a strategic partnership with Citi (C.N) to help develop its products, said the most recent investment brings its total raised to more than $92 million. Its other investors are Cisco, AT&T;, Accenture, Nokia, Singapore’s Temasek, Japan’s Mitsui, Bessemer Venture Partners, Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors and Marker LLC. While the number of attempted cyber attacks was 20,000 a week two or three years ago, that figure had now risen to 600,000-700,000, said Yoram Yaacovi, general manger of Microsoft Israel’s development center.  Israel has some 450 cyber start-ups, which receive 20 percent of global investment in the sector. Although the need for security is growing quickly, the proliferation of start-ups means that several companies compete in every subsector. “A large part of companies created won’t get to the finish line,” Nadav Zafrir, Team8 chief executive and former commander of the Israeli army’s technology and intelligence unit 8200, told a news conference.  He said he believes Team8’s strong partners and its plan to build a portfolio of different technologies gives it an edge. Team8 confirmed that Microsoft had been an investor since last June.  “The expectation of our investors is to build independent companies that will lead their sectors,” he said. Israel has a well established high tech industry, using skills of workers trained in the military and intelligence sectors. Tax breaks and government funding have encouraged start-ups, and also drawn in entrepreneurs from abroad. Launched in 2014, Team8 employs 180 people in Israel, the United States, Britain and Singapore and plans to hire 100 more workers in 2017. Two companies it created are Illusive Networks, which uses deception technology to detect attacks and has been installed at banks and retailers, and Claroty, which secures critical infrastructure sites such as oil and gas fields. Details of two more companies it has set up will be announced this year, Zafrir said.

631,QCOM,U.S. antitrust agency sues Qualcomm over patent licensing,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday, accusing the company of using “anticompetitive” tactics to maintain its monopoly on a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. The FTC, which works with the Justice Department to enforce antitrust law, said that San Diego-based Qualcomm used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers and to weaken competitors. Qualcomm said in a statement that it would “vigorously contest” the complaint and denied FTC allegations that it threatened to withhold chips in order to collect unreasonable licensing fees. Qualcomm shares fell 4 percent to $64.19 on Tuesday. The complaint is likely the agency’s last major action under current Democratic Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, who will step down Feb. 10, and comes just days before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Friday. Trump is expected to name Republican Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen as acting FTC chairwoman and will fill three vacancies that will reshape the agency. Ramirez and fellow Democrat Terrell McSweeny voted to approve the complaint but Ohlhausen dissented, saying that the lawsuit was based on a “flawed legal theory ... that lacks economic and evidentiary support.” In its complaint, the FTC said the patents that Qualcomm sought to license are standard essential patents, which means that the industry uses them widely and they are supposed to be licensed on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The FTC complaint also accused Qualcomm of refusing to license some standard essential patents to rival chipmakers, and of entering into an exclusive deal with Apple Inc. “Qualcomm’s customers have accepted elevated royalties and other license terms that do not reflect an assessment of terms that a court or other neutral arbiter would determine to be fair and reasonable,” the FTC said in its complaint. The FTC asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose to order Qualcomm to end these practices. For its part, Qualcomm accused the FTC of a last-minute dash to court. “This is an extremely disappointing decision to rush to file a complaint on the eve of Chairwoman Ramirez’s departure and the transition to a new administration,” Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm general counsel, said in a statement. “We look forward to defending our business in federal court, where we are confident we will prevail.” The company has faced a series of antitrust rulings and investigations from regulators across the globe. South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Qualcomm Inc 1.03 trillion won ($854 million) in December for what it called unfair practices in patent licensing, a decision the U.S. chipmaker said it will challenge in court. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals.",1172017,http://www.reuters.com/article/qualcomm-antitrust-lawsuit-ftc/u-s-antitrust-agency-sues-qualcomm-over-patent-licensing-idUSL1N1F721J

Qualcomm said in a statement that it would “vigorously contest” the complaint and denied FTC allegations that it threatened to withhold chips in order to collect unreasonable licensing fees. Qualcomm shares fell 4 percent to $64.19 on Tuesday. The complaint is likely the agency’s last major action under current Democratic Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, who will step down Feb. 10, and comes just days before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Friday. Trump is expected to name Republican Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen as acting FTC chairwoman and will fill three vacancies that will reshape the agency. Ramirez and fellow Democrat Terrell McSweeny voted to approve the complaint but Ohlhausen dissented, saying that the lawsuit was based on a “flawed legal theory ... that lacks economic and evidentiary support.” In its complaint, the FTC said the patents that Qualcomm sought to license are standard essential patents, which means that the industry uses them widely and they are supposed to be licensed on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. The FTC complaint also accused Qualcomm of refusing to license some standard essential patents to rival chipmakers, and of entering into an exclusive deal with Apple Inc. “Qualcomm’s customers have accepted elevated royalties and other license terms that do not reflect an assessment of terms that a court or other neutral arbiter would determine to be fair and reasonable,” the FTC said in its complaint.  The FTC asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Jose to order Qualcomm to end these practices.  For its part, Qualcomm accused the FTC of a last-minute dash to court.  “This is an extremely disappointing decision to rush to file a complaint on the eve of Chairwoman Ramirez’s departure and the transition to a new administration,” Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm general counsel, said in a statement. “We look forward to defending our business in federal court, where we are confident we will prevail.” The company has faced a series of antitrust rulings and investigations from regulators across the globe. South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Qualcomm Inc 1.03 trillion won ($854 million) in December for what it called unfair practices in patent licensing, a decision the U.S. chipmaker said it will challenge in court. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China following a 14-month probe, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals.

639,QCOM,Apple files $1 billion lawsuit against chip supplier Qualcomm,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc filed a $1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the U.S. government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones.  Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for “modem” chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm’s $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission. “If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm’s release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused,” Apple said in its lawsuit. In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple’s claims “baseless.” “Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm’s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information,” Rosenberg said in the statement. “We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple’s practices and a robust examination of the merits.” Qualcomm’s stock closed 2.4 percent lower at $62.88 on the news. Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on “reasonable” terms. In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips. It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a “no license, no chip” policy. In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said. The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices. In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint. Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple’s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel’s shares closed up 1 percent at $36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced. Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7. Qualcomm “has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time,” Rasgon said.

646,QCOM,"With new class action, phone and tablet buyers add to Qualcomm’s woes","(Reuters) - Every day seems to bring new troubles for Qualcomm, the chip maker accused last week by Apple and the Federal Trade Commission of abusing its monopoly on a key broadband processor used in cellphones and tablets. Wednesday’s headache: an antitrust class action by consumers who bought devices containing the Qualcomm processors.  The complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco by Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, says a class of potentially millions of consumers overpaid for devices because Qualcomm’s market domination forced manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung to pay inflated prices for essential Qualcomm technology. The manufacturers, in turn, passed the overcharges along to purchasers of the devices, according to the complaint.  That sort of damages claim by indirect purchasers – as end-use consumers are known in antitrust parlance – was squelched by the U.S. Supreme Court back in 1977 in Illinois Brick v. Illinois. In Illinois Brick the justices said that consumers at the end of a supply chain tainted by monopolistic overcharging can’t bring federal antitrust claims against the monopolist because (to oversimplify) it’s too hard to figure out what portion of the final cost of the product is attributable to antitrust violations.  So how do Qualcomm purchasers plan to get around Illinois Brick?  By taking advantage of California’s Cartwright Act, which allows indirect purchasers to recover money damages. If you look at the complaint against Qualcomm, you’ll see that it asserts only a claim for injunctive relief under the federal Sherman Act. The suit asks for treble damages under California state law, which is similar to laws in two dozen other states that allow consumers to recover for monopoly-generated overcharges. According to Jeff Friedman, one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers leading the Qualcomm case, mainstream economic theory holds that manufacturers pass overcharges down the supply line so consumers end up bearing almost the entire brunt of illegal costs. The Qualcomm complaint asserts that “the entire overcharge for the cellular devices was passed on to the members of the proposed class.”  Friedman pointed in an email to several antitrust class actions in which consumers have obtained damages despite Illinois Brick, including suits over optical disk drives, lithium ion batteries and milk. In the vast antitrust litigation against the illegal cartel that inflated the cost of liquid crystal display screens, indirect purchasers who bought televisions, computers and other products recovered more than $1 billion after U.S. District Judge Susan Illston of San Francisco refused to dismiss their claims under Illinois Brick.  Even in antitrust litigation over dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, defendants agreed to pay more than $200 million to end-use consumers – and that was after U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton of Oakland dismissed indirect purchaser claims. (An appeals was under way when the case settled.) Plaintiffs' lawyer Steve Berman said in an email that Judge Hamilton’s dismissal ruling was an outlier.  As Hagens Berman tells it, there only one catch for consumers who bought phones and tablets with allegedly overpriced Qualcomm processors: Only those who live in states with antitrust statutes like California’s Cartwright Act, known as “repealer laws,” can recover damages in the class action. “No repealer, no recovery,” Berman said, although Friedman added that the firm persuaded a federal judge in at least one case that a state repealer law should apply nationwide.  I left a phone message requesting comment on the consumer suit with a Qualcomm representative but didn’t hear back. The company has previously denied allegations by Apple and the FTC, insisting that it did not abuse the standard-setting process to overcharge for its technology.",1252017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-otc-qualcomm/with-new-class-action-phone-and-tablet-buyers-add-to-qualcomms-woes-idUSKBN1592KO

652,QCOM,"As regulators waver, Apple takes on Qualcomm in courts","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc’s new legal assault on Qualcomm in the United States and China reflects its conclusion that regulators are unlikely to put an end to what it considers the chip maker’s unfair business practices, analysts said. Apple (AAPL.O) has long objected to Qualcomm’s practice of charging for the “modem” chips that help phones use wireless networks data plans and its demands for a license fee based on the total price of the phones. Qualcomm (QCOM.O) was the original inventor of a number of key wireless technologies. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm over the practice on Jan. 17. But earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump named FTC Commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen to head the regulatory agency. Ohlhausen had vigorously opposed the FTC’s lawsuit.  “[W]e have a hard time seeing the case go forward with the dissenting FTC commissioner slated to become the head of the FTC,” Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday. “If the FTC abandons its case, it certainly would not be helpful to Apple, but we would guess that Apple will probably still try to push the issue.” In the Qualcomm case, Ohlhausen broke her usual practice of not commenting on her dissenting votes, saying the lawsuit was “based on a flawed legal theory ... that lacks economic and evidentiary support” and “fails to allege that Qualcomm charges more than a reasonable royalty.”  The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In its U.S lawsuit, filed on Jan. 20, Cupertino, California-based Apple alleges Qualcomm withheld $1 billion in rebates and other payments owed to Apple as a result of a Korean Fair Trade Commission investigation into the San Diego-based chip maker. That probe led to a $853 million fine for Qualcomm but no demand for changes to its business model. “For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with,” Apple said in a statement the same day it filed the lawsuit. But the intent of the suit is to challenge Qualcomm’s full-device royalty model. “They’re very clearly trying to attack the business model - that’s crystal clear,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein.

653,QCOM,"As regulators waver, Apple takes on Qualcomm in courts","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc’s new legal assault on Qualcomm in the United States and China reflects its conclusion that regulators are unlikely to put an end to what it considers the chip maker’s unfair business practices, analysts said. Apple has long objected to Qualcomm’s practice of charging for the “modem” chips that help phones use wireless networks data plans and its demands for a license fee based on the total price of the phones. Qualcomm was the original inventor of a number of key wireless technologies. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm over the practice on Jan. 17. But earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump named FTC Commissioner Maureen K. Ohlhausen to head the regulatory agency. Ohlhausen had vigorously opposed the FTC’s lawsuit. “ e have a hard time seeing the case go forward with the dissenting FTC commissioner slated to become the head of the FTC,” Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday. “If the FTC abandons its case, it certainly would not be helpful to Apple, but we would guess that Apple will probably still try to push the issue.” In the Qualcomm case, Ohlhausen broke her usual practice of not commenting on her dissenting votes, saying the lawsuit was “based on a flawed legal theory ... that lacks economic and evidentiary support” and “fails to allege that Qualcomm charges more than a reasonable royalty.” The FTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In its U.S lawsuit, filed on Jan. 20, Cupertino, California-based Apple alleges Qualcomm withheld $1 billion in rebates and other payments owed to Apple as a result of a Korean Fair Trade Commission investigation into the San Diego-based chip maker. That probe led to a $853 million fine for Qualcomm but no demand for changes to its business model. “For many years Qualcomm has unfairly insisted on charging royalties for technologies they have nothing to do with,” Apple said in a statement the same day it filed the lawsuit. But the intent of the suit is to challenge Qualcomm’s full-device royalty model. “They’re very clearly trying to attack the business model - that’s crystal clear,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein.

Qualcomm fell 5.4 percent to $53.82 after the chipmaker reported a lower-than-expected rise in quarterly revenue. The post-election rally roared back to life this week following solid earnings and optimism over U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-growth initiatives, catapulting the Dow above the historic mark. Trump’s business-friendly decisions since taking office on Friday include signing executive orders to reduce regulatory burden on domestic manufacturers and clearing the way for the construction of two oil pipelines. Investors have also cheered largely positive fourth-quarter earnings, which are expected to show growth of 7 percent, their biggest increase in two years. “So far the new administration has brought a pro-business approach and everyone is excited about that. But it’s not simple to get Congress and the House to agree on changes to the tax plan and regulation,” said Phil Blancato, chief executive of Ladenberg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. “We have seen relatively decent earnings and if we can hold that and if we get sales growth of over 3 percent then we’ll get a market that will grow higher.” Revenue for S&P; 500 companies in the fourth quarter is estimated to have risen 4.2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At 12:43 p.m. ET (1743 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 25.64 points, or 0.13 percent, at 20,094.15. The S&P; 500 was down 2.5 points, or 0.10 percent, at 2,295.87, after hitting a record high of 2300.99. The Nasdaq Composite was down 2.47 points, or 0.04 percent, at 5,653.87. It had hit a record high of 5669.61 just after the open. Eight of the 11 major S&P; 500 sectors were lower, with the utilities index’s 0.39 percent fall leading the decliners. Royal Caribbean Cruises jumped 8.3 percent to $95.05 after it forecast higher-than-expected adjusted earnings for 2017. Whirlpool fell 8.2 percent to $174.38 after the world’s largest maker of home appliances posted a quarterly profit that came in below expectations. Intel, Alphabet, Microsoft and coffee chain Starbucks are scheduled to report results after market close. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,642 to 1,215. On the Nasdaq, 1,761 issues fell and 1,018 advanced. The S&P; 500 index showed 63 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 125 new highs and 11 new lows.

The company’s shares were down 3.8 percent at $54.75 in aftermarket trading. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Apple Inc have sued Qualcomm accusing it of resorting to “anticompetitive” tactics to maintain a monopoly over chips used in smartphone. Apple also filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in Beijing on Wednesday, alleging that the chip supplier abused its clout and is seeking 1 billion yuan ($145.32 million) in damages. Qualcomm executives firmly defended the company’s licensing model on its quarterly conference call, and said its revenue forecast did not include any impact from the dispute with Apple. “Apple’s attack on Qualcomm’s business model is not only an attack on Qualcomm, but also an attack on the smartphone competition that Qualcomm’s business model enables,” the company’s president Derek Aberle said. Qualcomm said it expects to continue to supply to Apple during the dispute, and that the company’s contracts with the iPhone maker’s suppliers were still valid. South Korea’s antitrust regulator, The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC), fined Qualcomm 1.03 trillion won in December for what it called unfair business practices in patent licensing and modem chip sales.     The company said on Wednesday the latest quarter included an $868 million charge related to the KFTC investigation. The company’s licensing business generates royalties earned through the licensing of wireless patents to the mobile industry. Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, with the two accounting for 40 percent of its 2016 annual revenue.

662,QCOM,UPDATE 2-SoftBank expects to gain from Trump's promised deregulation,"TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp’s (9984.T) CEO Masayoshi Son said on Wednesday the Japanese firm should benefit from President Donald Trump’s promised deregulation of the American economy and that he is keeping his options open about U.S. telecoms unit Sprint (S.N).  SoftBank, a telecommunications and technology behemoth that holds a 29.9 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA.N), was among the first major foreign corporations to promise U.S. investments and jobs after the November presidential election. Billionaire Son pledged a $50 billion investment and 50,000 new jobs in the United States after meeting Trump in early December. “President Trump has promised to ease various regulations and that should make it easier to do business,” Son said at a press briefing in Tokyo following the release of SoftBank’s quarterly results. Son didn’t specify what deregulation promised by Trump would benefit his company. His investment pledge in December had revived speculation that telecoms firm Sprint, 83 percent owned by SoftBank, might rekindle merger talks with T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) that had died under pressure from U.S. regulators. Asked at Wednesday’s briefing about a renewed merger bid with T-mobile, Son said: “Three years ago, I was so eager to buy T-Mobile. But now, I have many options. Sprint can be profitable on its own. Keeping Sprint separate is also an option.” Some of Son’s $50 billion U.S. investment commitment could come from a giant tech fund backed by Saudi Arabia that SoftBank announced in October. As the telecoms services markets mature, Son wants to transform SoftBank into a company with cutting-edge tech investments, or what he calls the “Berkshire Hathaway of the tech industry”. SoftBank expects to invest over the next five years at least $25 billion in the $100 billion tech fund, which would be one of the world’s largest private equity investors and a potential kingpin in the technology industry. “We are preparing to launch a fund that would be far larger than all venture capitals combined,” Son said on Wednesday, adding it will own 20 percent to 40 percent of the companies it invests as top shareholder. Son declined to give details about the fund’s operations because of a “quiet period” ahead of the launch. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has revealed plans to invest $1 billion in the fund. Foxconn (2317.TW) of Taiwan, Oracle (ORCL.N) founder Larry Ellison’s family office and chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM.O) are said to be intending to invest in the fund.. Asked about Trump’s travel ban, Son said he wanted to refrain from making comments about “political matters”. SoftBank’s October-December operating profit soared 71 percent to 295.7 billion yen ($2.63 billion), beating a Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate of 246.30 billion yen. SmartEstimates give greater weight to recent forecasts by top-rated analysts. Sprint trimmed its quarterly loss as the No. 4 U.S. wireless carrier added more subscribers than Wall Street expected. This was the first full quarter since SoftBank completed a $32 billion acquisition of Britain’s most valuable technology company ARM, but SoftBank’s earnings are still highly dependent on Sprint and the performance of the domestic telecommunications business.

667,QCOM,"China's ZTE pleads guilty, settles U.S. sanctions case for nearly $900 million","NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp has agreed to plead guilty and pay nearly $900 million in a U.S. sanctions case, drawing a line under a damaging scandal that had threatened its cut off its supply chain. While the fine was larger than expected, ZTE, also a major smartphone maker, reported robust underlying earnings for 2016 and was upbeat in estimates for the first quarter. That and the resolution of the case helped its Hong Kong-listed shares surge 6 percent. A five-year investigation found ZTE conspired to evade U.S. embargoes by buying U.S. components, incorporating them into ZTE equipment and illegally shipping them to Iran. In addition, it was charged in connection with 283 shipments of telecommunications equipment to North Korea.  “ZTE Corporation not only violated export controls that keep sensitive American technology out of the hands of hostile regimes like Iran’s, they lied ... about their illegal acts,” U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. ZTE relies on U.S. suppliers for 25 percent to 30 percent of its components, many of which are key to its goods. It purchases about $2.6 billion worth of components a year from U.S. firms, according to a company spokesman. Qualcomm, Microsoft and Intel are among its suppliers. “ZTE acknowledges the mistakes it made, takes responsibility for them, and remains committed to positive change in the company,” ZTE Chief Executive Zhao Xianming said in a statement. The company agreed to a seven-year suspended denial of export privileges, which could be activated if there are further violations, as well as three years of probation, a compliance and ethics program, and a corporate monitor. It also agreed to an additional penalty of $300 million that will be suspended during the seven-year term on the condition the company complies with requirements in the agreement.  When asked about the ZTE case, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said relevant departments of the government would continue to pay attention as to whether Chinese firms were receiving fair treatment. “The Chinese government consistently opposes foreign governments putting unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies. At the same time, we have always asked our companies to operate legally abroad,” he told a news conference without elaborating. Tim O’Toole, a Washington D.C.-based lawyer with Miller & Chevalier specializing in sanction cases, said U.S. court documents suggest ZTE’s attempts to obstruct the investigation were the main reason for a penalty significantly higher than in similar cases. “What seems really important to U.S. regulators is whether a company or individual after the investigation starts is seen to continue to evade the sanctions and also obstruct the investigation,” he said. The investigation, spearheaded by the U.S. Department of Commerce, followed reports by Reuters in 2012 that ZTE had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of the best-known U.S. technology companies to Iran’s largest telecoms carrier. Last year, the Commerce Department released internal documents showing senior ZTE executives instructing the company to carry out a project for dodging export controls in Iran, North Korea, Syria, Sudan and Cuba. ZTE has replaced executives allegedly involved, including naming a new president.    The company said on Wednesday it slid to a preliminary net loss of 2.36 billion yuan ($342 million) in 2016, its first loss in four years, due to the settlement.  But without the fine, it would have logged 3.8 billion yuan in profit, 18 percent higher than a year earlier. That was better than expected, as was a preliminary estimate for the first-quarter net profit rising between 21 and 31 percent, said Cindy Lam, an analyst with UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. The settlement includes a $661 million penalty to Commerce; $430 million in combined criminal fines and forfeiture; and $101 million paid to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The action marks OFAC’s largest-ever settlement with a non-financial entity.    The Commerce Department will recommend ZTE be removed from a  list of entities that U.S. firms cannot supply without a license if it lives up to its deal and a court approves its agreement with the Justice Department. First placed on the list in March 2016, it has continued to do business with U.S. suppliers under a temporary general license that has been extended several times, with the latest reprieve expiring March 29. The company’s guilty pleas, which must be approved by a judge, will take place in U.S. District Court in Texas.

668,QCOM,U.S. tech sanctions will rattle China's firewall,"HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China has been giving fair warning. Telecoms equipment maker ZTE has agreed to plead guilty for violating U.S. export controls. The charges could have been more severe and the $892 million fine is manageable for the $9 billion company. More powerful is the message: the new U.S. administration is prepared to take action against corporate giants to rein in troublesome nations. The plea caps a five-year probe into the Shenzhen-based group over its business dealings with Iran and North Korea. Following a 2012 Reuters report, U.S. agencies have been investigating ZTE for selling telecommunications equipment with American technology to countries under U.S. economic sanctions. One year ago, the Commerce Department briefly banned all stateside firms from selling to the Chinese company, which relies on U.S. suppliers like Qualcomm and Intel for up to 30 percent of its components. ZTE will now plead guilty to unlawful export - shipping goods to countries without proper licenses - as well as lying about it. And it will be placed on an embarrassingly tight leash. It will agree to a three-year probation period and a seven-year suspended “denial of export privileges”. That means if ZTE does not meet certain conditions over this period, or further violates U.S. export laws, regulators could remove the suspension and deal a potentially lethal blow to ZTE’s supply chain.  The financial hit is not so bad. On Wednesday, ZTE estimated a full-year net loss of 2.4 billion yuan ($342 million) for 2016 after taking into account the fines. But it is already forecasting nearly a 32 percent year-on-year jump in net profit for the three months to March. The company’s Hong Kong shares rose as much as 8 percent on the news of the fine and its earnings. Relief is justified because the outcome could have been worse: French bank BNP Paribas was slapped with a mega $8.9 billion fine in 2014 for breaching similar U.S. sanctions. Still, after North Korea’s recent provocations, including firing four ballistic missiles toward Japan this week, now is opportune time for the United States to remind distant neighbours just how far its reach can go.

The company agreed to a seven-year suspended denial of export privileges, which could be activated if there are further violations, as well as three years of probation, a compliance and ethics program, and a corporate monitor. It also agreed to an additional penalty of $300 million that will be suspended during the seven-year term on the condition the company complies with requirements in the agreement.  When asked about the ZTE case, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said relevant departments of the government would continue to pay attention as to whether Chinese firms were receiving fair treatment. “The Chinese government consistently opposes foreign governments putting unilateral sanctions on Chinese companies. At the same time, we have always asked our companies to operate legally abroad,” he told a news conference without elaborating. Tim O’Toole, a Washington D.C.-based lawyer with Miller & Chevalier specializing in sanction cases, said U.S. court documents suggest ZTE’s attempts to obstruct the investigation were the main reason for a penalty significantly higher than in similar cases. “What seems really important to U.S. regulators is whether a company or individual after the investigation starts is seen to continue to evade the sanctions and also obstruct the investigation,” he said. The investigation, spearheaded by the U.S. Department of Commerce, followed reports by Reuters in 2012 that ZTE had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of the best-known U.S. technology companies to Iran’s largest telecoms carrier. Last year, the Commerce Department released internal documents showing senior ZTE executives instructing the company to carry out a project for dodging export controls in Iran, North Korea, Syria, Sudan and Cuba. ZTE has replaced executives allegedly involved, including naming a new president.    The company said on Wednesday it slid to a preliminary net loss of 2.36 billion yuan ($342 million) in 2016, its first loss in four years, due to the settlement.  But without the fine, it would have logged 3.8 billion yuan in profit, 18 percent higher than a year earlier. That was better than expected, as was a preliminary estimate for the first-quarter net profit rising between 21 and 31 percent, said Cindy Lam, an analyst with UOB Kay Hian in Hong Kong. The settlement includes a $661 million penalty to Commerce; $430 million in combined criminal fines and forfeiture; and $101 million paid to the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The action marks OFAC’s largest-ever settlement with a non-financial entity.    The Commerce Department will recommend ZTE be removed from a  list of entities that U.S. firms cannot supply without a license if it lives up to its deal and a court approves its agreement with the Justice Department. First placed on the list in March 2016, it has continued to do business with U.S. suppliers under a temporary general license that has been extended several times, with the latest reprieve expiring March 29. The company’s guilty pleas, which must be approved by a judge, will take place in U.S. District Court in Texas.

671,QCOM,Mobileye deal to fuel investment in late-stage Israeli start-ups,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Intel’s $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye  has catapulted Israeli hi-tech into the global league, and is likely to stimulate investment in the sector’s other late-stage startups, where funds are most needed. Fundraising in late-stage startups - more mature firms that are already selling products rather than just the bright but unexploited ideas of entrepreneurs - has begun to increase. According to the Israel Venture Capital (IVC) Research Center, it rose to $2.9 billion in 2016 from $2.4 billion in 2015 as investors search for a higher yield on their investments. Venture capitalists believe the U.S. semiconductor giant’s purchase last week of Mobileye, which specializes in technology for driverless cars, should accelerate the trend. “A concern over the years has been that compared to the U.S., Israel cannot produce outsized returns,” said Adam Fisher, a partner who manages the Israel office for California-based venture capital fund Bessemer. “Mobileye is a perfect example of how a big business can be built in Israel and how a large corporate will not hesitate to pay a strategic premium for the business despite its location.” The price was about 21 times Mobileye’s expected 2017 revenue, or more than six times more expensive than the semiconductor industry’s three-year deal average. Until recently, many Israeli tech firms failed to grow enough to stay independent. Global companies, keen to tap into the skills of workers trained in the military and intelligence sectors, often bought them before they floated on the share market or when they were still small-cap stocks on the Nasdaq exchange. This was the case with Waze, the Israeli map app, which Google bought in 2013 for $1.15 billion. That same year, Wix, an Israeli startup which helps people build websites, made its market debut on New York’s Nasdaq, raising $127 million seven years after the company was founded.     Only a few, such as cyber security firm Check Point Software Technologies, which has a market valuation of almost $18 billion, have succeeded in remaining independent. Defense tech specialists such as Elbit Systems are largely off limits to foreign investors for Israeli national security reasons.     Michael Eisenberg, a partner at the Aleph VC, said the Mobileye sale signaled to late-stage financiers that they can expect much more significant returns on their investments. “It’s an accelerant and a belief that there is no glass ceiling for Israeli companies,” said Eisenberg, who also manages the portfolio of U.S. VC Benchmark in Israel. Autotalks, a provider of vehicle-to-vehicle communication for improving road safety, said on Wednesday it raised $30 million in late-stage funding from investors including Samsung’s Catalyst Fund, bringing to $70 million its total raised to date. Venture capitalists typically seek returns of 3-10 times their overall investment over time, with those investing at an early stage expecting a higher multiple than at the later stage.  Long known as the “startup nation”, Israel is maturing into  a “scale-up nation”, said Steven Schoenfeld, founder of BlueStar Indexes, which develops indexes and exchange traded-funds (ETF) that track Israeli stocks. However, Israelis are largely missing out on their own success as local institutions shy away from investing in technology companies, especially those listed abroad. Israeli institutions, which are typically conservative, tend to stick with indexes and benchmarks from the Tel Aviv exchange, he said.     Mobileye now accounts for 16 percent of BlueStar’s Israeli technology index. The ETF that tracks the index has gained 13.8 percent so far this year to an all-time high, while the Nasdaq is up 9.6 percent.     Schoenfeld pointed to software provider Amdocs and Wix as examples of other companies “going the distance” by staying independent for longer. Cyber security firm CyberArk, which is traded on Nasdaq, is another with strong growth potential.         Mobileye understood it could grow only so much on its own. The company has expanded rapidly in the two years since its New York share offering into mapping, systems building and intelligence of driving.  “All of these take time to build and time to get resources and Intel already has these resources,” said Mobileye co-founder Amnon Shasuha. “If we want to ... be the key player in autonomous driving, we need to think about it as an industry and not as a product.”     With more than 200 startups Israel is a growing center for automotive technology. Last year startups in the sector raised $681 million, nearly double the amount in 2015, according to the IVC.     Due to Mobileye, car manufacturers and their suppliers have been “making the pilgrimage” to Israel for the last several years and met with other startups, Fisher said.    The sector is already enjoying robust pricing for M&A; and the Mobileye deal will continue that, he said.     Potential acquirers “will more likely be the traditional tech companies that have a declared interest in the automotive sector rather than car companies themselves, but the latter wouldn’t surprise me either,” Fisher said.     Bessemer has invested in depth sensor technology company Oryx Vision as well as Otonomo, which developed a connected car data exchange, and Vayyar, a provider of 3D imaging sensors.     Argus Cyber Security, which has raised $30 million and collaborates with Qualcomm, is linking the automotive sector with another of Israel’s most vibrant sectors - cyber security - helping to prevent connected cars from being hacked.     The Mobileye deal, said Argus CEO Ofer Ben-Noon, could accelerate his company’s growth. “There is no doubt there will be more investments in Israel for automotive, and a lot more M&A;,” he said.    Car makers General Motors, Daimler, Volvo and Honda have all opened research and development centers in Israel.    Josh Kram, senior director for Middle East Affairs at theU.S. Chamber of Commerce, noted that about 300 American companies have R&D; centers in Israel, including Intel.     “Now they are moving into the autonomous space and purchasing Mobileye has catapulted them to the next level,” he said. “It’s a win-win for both companies.”  ",3222017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-tech-israel/mobileye-deal-to-fuel-investment-in-late-stage-israeli-start-ups-idUSKBN16T29E

Apple had filed the lawsuit accusing Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. The lawsuit came days after the U.S. government accused the chipmaker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones. “It (Apple) has launched a global attack on Qualcomm and is attempting to use its enormous market power to coerce unfair and unreasonable license terms from Qualcomm,” the chipmaker said in a statement on Monday. Qualcomm filed counterclaims to Apple’s lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. The chipmaker said in the statement that Apple interfered in its agreements with licensees that manufacture iPhones and iPads. Qualcomm also said Apple threatened it in an attempt to prevent it from making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones, and misrepresented performance differences between iPhones using Qualcomm modems and those using competitor-supplied modems.

U.S.-listed shares of BlackBerry were up 17.8 percent at $9.07 in heavy trading, while they were also up 17 percent at C$12.03 in Toronto.  Qualcomm’s shares were down about 2 percent at $54.20. The dispute started in 2016 following Qualcomm’s agreement to cap certain royalties applied to payments made by BlackBerry under a licensing deal. Qualcomm said on Wednesday it does not agree with the decision of the arbitration panel, but the payment is binding and not appealable.

684,QCOM,UPDATE 2-Qualcomm to pay BlackBerry $814.9 mln to settle royalties dispute,"(Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc said on Wednesday it was asked to refund Canada’s BlackBerry Ltd $814.9 million in an arbitration over royalties for certain past sales. U.S.-listed shares of BlackBerry were up 17.8 percent at $9.07 in heavy trading, while they were also up 17 percent at C$12.03 in Toronto.  Qualcomm’s shares were down about 2 percent at $54.20. The dispute started in 2016 following Qualcomm’s agreement to cap certain royalties applied to payments made by BlackBerry under a licensing deal. Qualcomm said on Wednesday it does not agree with the decision of the arbitration panel, but the payment is binding and not appealable. With BlackBerry planning to invest for growth in its software businesses, the arbitration award will strengthen the company’s balance sheet and increase the likelihood of acquisitions, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley wrote in a note.

689,QCOM,CORRECTED-Chipmaker Qualcomm's revenue falls 9.6 pct,"(Corrects date to March 26 from March 31 in second paragraph) April 19 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, reported 9.6 percent fall in quarterly revenue, hurt by an arbitration decision to pay Canada’s BlackBerry Ltd for previously received royalties. Net income attributable to the company fell to $749 million, or 50 cents per share, in the second quarter ended March 26, from $1.16 billion, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2ot17st) Revenue fell to $5.02 billion from $5.55 billion. The quarter included a $974 million reduction to revenue, or 48 cents per share, related to the BlackBerry arbitration decision, Qualcomm said on Wednesday. Qualcomm’s patent-licensing practices have come under increasing scrutiny from governments across the world, as well as its key customers. Apple Inc sued the chipmaker in January, accusing Qualcomm of overcharging for its chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm fired back at the iPhone maker last week, saying Apple had breached agreements with the firm.

692,QCOM,Global foundation launches value-based healthcare pilots,"(Reuters) - Key healthcare stakeholders, led by the World Economic Forum, plan pilot programs this year to show the value of a new model for healthcare that would track and pay for treatment based on how well it works rather than the volume of care. The first pilot, being set up in Atlanta, Georgia, will focus on treating heart failure. Signatories include Novartis AG, maker of heart failure drug Entresto, drugmaker Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, medical device maker Medtronic Plc, integrated health insurer/provider Kaiser Permanente, Qualcomm Inc’s health-data unit, and health officials from the Netherlands and Britain. Novartis’ sales of Entresto have disappointed as doctors hesitate to switch patients from older drugs and insurers push back on reimbursement for the $4,500-a-year drug. The company has conducted studies showing the drug’s impact on hospitalization and quality of life, and done deals where insurers cover it based on patient outcomes. The notion of linking healthcare decisions to value — and deliver better patient outcomes at lower cost — has been around for about a decade, but implementation has proven difficult. “Hospitals, primary care practices, the way people get paid — all of that has to be transformed,” said Harvard Business School Professor Michael Porter. “The push back is not on the ideas, it’s on implementation.” The WEF, a global foundation fostering cooperation between public and private sectors, is urging global leaders to focus on patient outcomes. “We believe that this is a model that should be adopted globally ... We plan on sticking with this for several years,” said Rick Valencia, president of Qualcomm Life. But questions remain about the U.S. government’s commitment to health reform. “Something of a political war is underway in healthcare,” Porter said. “The AMA (American Medical Association) has been a great supporter of the old system. The private insurance industry, although there are important exceptions, has also been holding this back — they are doing pretty well the way it is. They are making good margins.” He said the Trump administration has sent “mixed signals” about outcomes-based healthcare. “Medical device and pharmaceutical companies are starting to realize that if they don’t change the nature of healthcare, their prices will be cut,” Porter said. “If they want to make good profits ... they are going to have to prove that their drug actually lowers the overall cost of care.” Regional pilots are planned for The Netherlands, Singapore and China.

693,QCOM,Qualcomm warns of profit hit as Apple battle intensifies,"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc slashed its current-quarter profit and revenue forecasts on Friday, amid an escalating legal battle between the chipmaker and Apple Inc . Apple said it had decided to withhold royalty payments to its contract manufacturers until the dispute is resolved in court. The payments made by Apple to its contract manufacturers are, in turn, owed by the contractors to Qualcomm in royalties, according to the chipmaker’s licensing business model. The iPhone maker sued Qualcomm in January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, is a major supplier to Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm’s revenue in its latest fiscal year. “Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court,” an Apple spokesman said on Friday. Apple also noted it had been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years, but said Qualcomm had refused to negotiate “fair terms”. “Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade,” Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s general counsel, said in a statement. Qualcomm said it will not receive royalties from Apple’s contract manufacturers for sales during the quarter ended March 31, and that its forecast for the third fiscal quarter now excludes that revenue. “Even if one believed this was a worst case scenario (for Qualcomm), we struggle to see a resolution anytime soon as the parties entrench,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said. “We suspect this is going to continue to get uglier,” he added. Qualcomm now expects revenue of $4.8 billion-$5.6 billion for its third fiscal quarter, down from the $5.3 billion-$6.1 billion it had previously expected. The company lowered its forecast for current-quarter adjusted profit to 75-85 cents per share, from 90 cents-$1.15 per share. “(Apple’s) contract manufacturers may make some form of partial payment, but initial indications are that any payment would likely be insignificant,” Qualcomm said. Through Thursday, Qualcomm’s shares had fallen 17 percent since Apple’s lawsuit. The stock — the worst performer this year on the Philadelphia semiconductor index — was down 0.7 percent at $52.86 in midday trading.",4282017,http://www.reuters.com/article/apple-lawsuit-qualcomm/qualcomm-warns-of-profit-hit-as-apple-battle-intensifies-idUSL1N1I022X

709,QCOM,Qualcomm sues four Apple contract manufacturers,"(Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc filed a lawsuit against four Apple Inc contract manufacturers, including Foxconn Technology Group, for not paying royalties, as its legal battle with the iPhone maker intensifies. The other manufacturers listed in the filing by Qualcomm were Pegatron Corp, Wistron Corp and Compal Electronics Inc. Qualcomm said in its complaint that Apple had advised the contract manufacturers to withhold royalty payments and agreed to indemnify them against any damages resulting from the breach of their agreements with Qualcomm. In the complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Qualcomm did not disclose the quantum of royalty owed to it by the manufacturers. San Diego-based Qualcomm said last month that Apple had decided to withhold royalty payments to its contract manufacturers that are owed to the chipmaker, for sales made in the first quarter of 2017, until the dispute is resolved in court. “While not disputing their contractual obligations to pay for the use of Qualcomm’s inventions, the manufacturers say they must follow Apple’s instructions not to pay,” Qualcomm said on Wednesday. Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, added in the filing that Apple is trying to force the company to agree to a “unreasonable demand for a below-market direct license”. Apple reiterated that it had been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but the company has refused to negotiate fair terms. Qualcomm said it sought an order that would require the manufacturers to comply with their long-standing contractual obligations to the company, as well as declaratory relief and damages. Apple sued Qualcomm in January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. The chipmaker slashed its current-quarter profit and revenue forecasts last month, saying it excluded revenue receivable from the four contract manufacturers. Qualcomm is a major supplier to Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks. Foxconn Technology Group is the trading name of Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, the main assembler of Apple devices. Qualcomm’s shares were marginally lower at $55.82 in midday trading, while Apple’s shares fell 2.3 percent to $151.85.",5172017,http://www.reuters.com/article/apple-lawsuit-qualcomm/qualcomm-sues-four-apple-contract-manufacturers-idUSL2N1IJ1NA

715,QCOM,Qualcomm shows off wireless charging for electric vehicles,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc said on Thursday it had demonstrated how electric vehicles could be charged wirelessly while driving, a technology some believe will help accelerate the adoption of self-driving cars. The smartphone chipmaker said a so-called “dynamic charging” test took place on a test track in Versailles, France. It used two Renault Kangoo vehicles driving over embedded pads in the road that transferred a charge to the cars’ batteries at up to 20 kilowatts at highway speeds.    Experts believe that self-driving cars of tomorrow will be electric and require a way to charge themselves without human intervention.      Wireless charging is an important area of research for carmakers, their suppliers and start-ups like xChargepoint, WiTricity and HEVO Power.  Qualcomm, which supplies chips to Android phone makers and Apple Inc, is on track to become the leading supplier to the fast-growing automotive chips market given its pending $38 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors.  European Union regulators are to rule by June 9 on the deal, which would be the semiconductor industry’s biggest to date. Electric vehicle charging is one area where Qualcomm could grow as it strives to reduce its dependence on a cooling smartphone market.  Qualcomm Chief Executive Steven Mollenkopf has called automotive technology and Internet of Things - in which household objects like cars and refrigerators communicate - a “tremendous opportunity” for the company.

Wistron Corp (3231.TW) also said it had not received the relevant documents. Pegatron Corp (4938.TW) declined to comment, while Compal Electronics Inc (2324.TW) did not offer immediate comment. Last month, Qualcomm slashed its profit and revenue forecasts for the current quarter, saying it excluded revenue receivable from the four contract manufacturers. Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones, said in its filing that Apple is trying to force the company to agree to an “unreasonable demand for a below-market direct license”.  Apple reiterated that it had been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years but the company has refused to negotiate fair terms. Qualcomm’s shares fell 1 percent to $55.36 on Wednesday  while Apple’s shares slid 3.4 percent to $150.25. Shares in the Taiwanese suppliers fell between 0.4 percent and 2 percent in early Thursday trade except for Compal which rose 1.5 percent.

722,QCOM,"UPDATE 1-BlackBerry climbs on hopes for growth in security, autos","TORONTO (Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd shares (BB.TO) BBRY.O surged to a four-year high in Toronto on Tuesday, extending a two-month rally spurred on by expectations for strong growth in the fast-expanding cyber security and automotive software markets.   The Canadian shares climbed as much as 9.4 percent to C$15.34. As of early afternoon, volume was at about 3 million shares, nearly triple the full-day three-month average.  The rally followed an announcement by Ford Motor Co (F.N) on Friday that the automaker planned to start updating software on its vehicles using a wireless system to enhance security based on BlackBerry technology.  BlackBerry’s U.S.-listed shares gained more than 9 percent on Monday, when Canada’s stock market was closed for a holiday. Ford’s Sync 3 interactive system for cars runs on BlackBerry’s QNX operating system, which is capable of delivering software updates “over the air.”  Some investors believe that Friday’s announcement from Ford is a sign that QNX will be more broadly adopted in the auto industry as other automakers start updating their cars using the relatively new over-the-air approach, analysts said. “BlackBerry is well positioned at the epicenter of this transformation,” CCS Insight analyst Nicholas McQuire told Reuters.  McQuire and other analysts also cited this month’s global “ransomware” attack, dubbed WannaCry, with helping to raise BlackBerry’s profile. BlackBerry shares have climbed more than 60 percent since they reported stronger-than-expected earnings on March 31, which reinforced expectations that the company is succeeding in re-inventing itself after the collapse of a smartphone business that was once the market leader.  The rally gained steam in mid-April on news that BlackBerry had won a binding arbitration forcing chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) to pay it back almost $1 billion. “This chunk of change from Qualcomm has really changed investor sentiment on BlackBerry,” said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley. Investors are betting that Chief Executive John Chen will use those funds to build up the company’s cyber security and automotive software efforts and possibly make acquisitions related to its relatively new Radar tracking business, Walkley said. Last week, an equity analyst with Macquarie reported that BlackBerry was working with two luxury automakers to develop a security service that would remotely scan vehicles for computer viruses. The company does not break out cyber security revenue, though Walkley said it accounts for only a small percentage of its business, which remains focused on managing secure connections to mobile devices.

Technology stocks have been enjoying a record-setting rally, helped largely by a recent string of strong quarterly earnings. The S&P; 500 technology index has risen 18.5 percent this year and is on track to register its best yearly performance since 2014. However, the index tumbled 2.7 percent on Friday, sparked by a sharp drop in Apple shares amid reports that the company is using slower modems in upcoming iPhones, compared with its rivals. Shares of the world’s most valuable publicly-listed company were off 2.34 percent to $145.59 in heavy premarket trading on Monday. Closely watched technology stocks, including those of Microsoft, Facebook, Netflix and Alphabet, were also in the red. “We’re starting to question valuations of technology (stocks) at these levels and investors are trying to jockey their way around this thought process,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Wall Street’s major indexes hit all-time highs on Friday, driven by banks and energy stocks but those gains were offset by the tech selloff later in the day. Dow e-minis were down 18 points, or 0.08 percent, at 8:26 a.m. ET (1226 GMT), with 13,576 contracts changing hands. S&P; 500 e-minis were down 4 points, or 0.16 percent, with 143,151 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 51.25 points, or 0.89 percent, on volume of 34,454 contracts Investors are likely to be on the sidelines ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting starting Tuesday, where traders see a 94 percent chance for an interest rate hike. Shares of General Electric rose 3 percent to $28.81 after the company said Jeff Immelt would retire as chief executive and would be replaced by John Flannery, the head of GE healthcare, ending a years-long succession plan. Shares of Apple suppliers, including Qualcomm, Skyworks Solutions and Micron Tech, were off between 0.6-2.12 percent.

The S&P; 500 technology index has risen 18.5 percent this year and is on track for its best yearly performance since 2014. * Apple suffered its worst drop in 14 months on Friday, sparking a selloff in technology stocks amid news of using slower modems in upcoming iPhones. Shares of the world’s most valuable listed company fell 2 percent to $145.97 in heavy premarket trading on Monday. * Big technology names such as Mircosoft, Facebook , Netflix and Alphabet were in the red. * Shares of Apple suppliers, including Qualcomm, Skyworks Solutions and Micron Tech, also took a hit. * However, a 1.2 percent rise in oil prices may cushion the blow on the major indexes from the tech selloff. * Investors are also likely to be on the sidelines ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting starting Tuesday, where traders see a 94 percent chance for an interest rate hike. * Shares of General Electric rose 2.7 percent to $28.70 after the company said Jeff Immelt would retire as chief executive and would be replaced by John Flannery, the head of GE healthcare, ending a years-long succession plan. * Coherus BioSciences tumbled 25 percent to $15.50 after the FDA denied the approval of its biosimilar for Amgen Neulasta, which fights infections in cancer patients.

740,QCOM,CORRECTED-Born-again BlackBerry: Canadian icon hopes to ride trucks to growth," BOLTON, Ontario (Reuters) - A visit to trucking firm Titanium Transportation helps explain why BlackBerry’s stock is once again a darling in Canadian markets, having soared 70 percent in two months.  Nestled in an industrial area some 50 kilometers north of Toronto, the trucker is an early adopter of a new BlackBerry fleet-tracking service known as Radar, which uses $400 boxes to collect and transmit information on movement, temperature and physical contents of Titanium’s 1,300 truck trailers.  Efficiency gains tied to Radar should allow Titanium to get maximum utilization of its fleet, positioning it to cut the number of trailers by five percent and also reduce labor costs, company executive Marilyn Daniel told Reuters.  “Time is everything in our world,” she said. “Being able to tell a driver where exactly a trailer is as opposed to having a driver search through a yard for sometimes hours has been a definite improvement.”  Radar is emblematic of BlackBerry Chief Executive John Chen’s strategy for turning around the Canadian icon, by steering the company away from consumer electronics and back to its roots of selling products to businesses.  Beyond Radar, BlackBerry is also betting on other types of software for industrial customers. It is leveraging its QNX subsidiary’s software foothold deep inside car infotainment consoles to expand into self-driving technology, while promoting its cyber-security software and services to thwart increased threats from hacking.  BlackBerry’s stock rallied after it showed signs of progress in quarterly earnings results at the end of March, followed by news in April of a nearly $1 billion cash windfall from arbitration with Qualcomm expected to fund future investments in growth. That comes in the face of an expected revenue decline to below $1 billion this year for the first time since 2004. At its smartphone peak, BlackBerry had annual sales of $20 billion.  Among the recent BlackBerry bulls are institutional investors such as Nokota Management, which took a new position with almost 4.8 million shares in the first quarter, and Oppenheimer Funds, which added 3.3 million more shares to its existing 4 million share stake, according to U.S. securities filings.  Iridian Asset Management and Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management, two of BlackBerry’s biggest shareholders, each raised their stakes by around a quarter as of the end of March.  Nokota did not respond to requests for comment, while the others all declined to discuss their stakes in BlackBerry.  The strategy is not without risks. BlackBerry faces challenges entering the telematics market, where analysts say rivals include Omnitracs, Teletrac Navman [VCRCPM.UL], Tomtom NV, Trimble Inc and U.S. telecommunications giant Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon last year paid some $2.4 billion to buy GPS vehicle tracking firm Fleetmatics Group Plc.  Radar “is not a unique and earth-shattering product,” said Nicholas Farhi, a partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants who advises companies on optimizing logistics operations.  That’s why some investors advise caution, saying it is too soon to figure out how to properly value the new BlackBerry offerings.  “It’s not the type of situation you can justify from a valuation standpoint,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which manages more than $1.5 billion and exited the stock a decade ago, when BlackBerry phones were still dominant. “It is all about hope and promise.”  And yet hope and promise among BlackBerry investors were hard to come by in the aftermath of Apple and Samsung walking away with the consumer hand-held phone business.  Since taking the company’s helm in 2013 to attempt a turnaround, Chen has turned to technology products used inside automobiles and corporate cyber security services, in addition to targeting the gritty trucking industry with Radar.  He also bolstered the company’s ability to manage rival devices in the workforce - still the single largest contributor to sales - with the purchase of rival Good Technology in 2015. And he outsourced production of handsets last year, meaning the company receives a cut from any devices sold by its partners rather than carrying the risk and revenue on its own books.  With Radar, BlackBerry enables customers to track trailers across country, and drivers can quickly locate vacant trailers scattered across vast parking lots. Previously, where drivers had to walk around those lots, banging on trailers in search of a hollow sound indicating it was empty.  BlackBerry charges $10 to $20 per month for every trailer connected to Radar, a product that an analyst at investment bank Macquarie says could play a pivotal role in a more than doubling of BlackBerry’s sales by 2020.  Sandeep Chennakeshu, president of the BlackBerry Technology Solutions unit that oversees Radar, told Reuters that large package delivery firms and big carriers of lumber and home goods are among the more than 50 companies testing it.  “It really depends on us convincing our customers to try our solution,” he said. “Once they try it, we’re very confident they’ll see the benefit.”  BlackBerry says that it is targeting some 16 million to 20 million trailers, chassis, vans, refrigerated units and piece of construction equipment for the Radar service, with a new variant on the hardware due to launch later this year.  On its last earnings call, the company named Trailer Wizards, a Canadian trailer rental and storage company with 25,000 trailers, as its third Radar customer.  AT&T will supply needed cellular connections for Radar in North America, and a second carrier is lined up to provide such services when it expands to Europe and Asia, Chennakeshu said.  The company expands Radar’s functionality with quarterly updates. The next one will tell customers if a trailer is a quarter, half or three-quarters full and improve integration with warehouse inventory management systems, he said.  The Radar boxes can send alerts when a trailer door is opened, its internal temperature goes beyond a set range, has been emptied or travels through a specific geography, features which Chennakeshu said are attractive for tightly-regulated movers including pharmaceutical companies.  Raymond James analyst Steven Li forecasts that 8 million trailers will be equipped with Radar by fiscal 2020, generating annual revenue of $80 million.  Macquarie analyst Gus Papageorgiou is even more bullish, saying combined hardware sales and subscription fees could hit $540 million in fiscal 2020.  “The best is yet to come for BlackBerry,” said Paul Rivett, president of Fairfax Financial, the company’s second largest shareholder and owner of BlackBerry debt that can be converted into shares at $10 a piece in late 2020.  “Its future earnings growth as a software company is only starting to be understood,” said Rivett.

743,QCOM,Apple tells court Qualcomm chip licenses are invalid,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc broadened a legal attack on Qualcomm Inc, arguing to a U.S. federal court that license agreements that secure the chip maker a cut of every iPhone manufactured were invalid. If successful, Apple’s attack would undermine a core tenet of Qualcomm’s business model. Apple sued San Diego-based Qualcomm in January, saying the chip maker improperly withheld $1 billion in rebates because Apple helped Korean regulators investigate Qualcomm. Apple’s initial lawsuit was a relatively narrow one focused on whether it violated a contract with Qualcomm by helping regulators that were investigating Qualcomm’s business practices. But the new filing expands Apple’s claims and seeks to stop Qualcomm’s longstanding business model using a legal theory based on a ruling last month. The U.S. Supreme Court made it harder for manufacturers and drug companies to control how their products are used or resold, ruling in May against printer company Lexmark International Inc in a patent dispute over another company’s resale of its used ink cartridges. In a Tuesday brief seen by Reuters, Apple took aim at Qualcomm’s practice of requiring customers to sign patent license agreements before purchasing chips, known in the industry as “no license, no chips”. The license allows Qualcomm to take a percentage of the overall selling price for iPhone in exchange for supplying the modem chips that let phones connect to cellular data networks. Apple argued that the ruling involving Lexmark showed that Qualcomm was entitled to only “one reward” for its intellectual property and products.  Qualcomm should be allowed to charge for either a patent license or a chip, but not both, Apple argued. Apple wants to be able to buy chips without signing the license agreement that forces it to pay a part of the overall iPhone sale price. Apple also asked the court to stop lawsuits that Qualcomm had filed against Foxconn Technology Group and three other contract makers that assemble the iPhone on Apple’s behalf and are the formal buyers of Qualcomm’s chip, as is standard in the electronics industry.

The FTC sued Qualcomm in January, alleging the company  engaged in anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly on the chips that let cell phones connect to mobile data networks.] The FTC highlighted Qualcomm’s “no license, no chips” policy under which the San Diego company refuses to sell chips unless customers also sign a patent license agreement and pay Qualcomm fees. Qualcomm refused to grant licenses to its rivals in order to keep a monopoly, the FTC alleged. Qualcomm asked Koh to throw out the case, arguing that even if all the FTC’s allegations were true, they would not amount to wrongdoing.  Qualcomm, the largest independent maker of chips used in smartphones, is a major supplier to Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) for modem chips that connect phones to wireless networks. Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), which are not parties to the case, filed briefs opposing Qualcomm’s attempt to the have the case dismissed.  Koh rejected Qualcomm’s arguments, ruling that the FTC had “adequately alleged” anticompetitive behavior. “We look forward to further proceedings in which we will be able to develop a more accurate factual record,” Qualcomm’s Rosenberg said in the statement.  Separately, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion in January. Last week, Apple argued Qualcomm’s chip licenses are invalid under a ruling last month from the U.S. Supreme Court. Apple’s contract manufacturers such as Foxconn stopped paying Qualcomm as that case proceeds, which in turn prompted Qualcomm to sue the contract manufacturers. In addition to the complaint from the FTC, Qualcomm has faced a series of antitrust rulings and investigations from regulators across the globe, including China and South Korea. The FTC’s case is No. 5:17-cv-00220 in the Northern District of California.

752,QCOM,Factbox: EU hits Google with record $2.7 billion fine,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission handed down a record 2.42 billion euro  ($2.73 billion) fine to Alphabet (GOOGL.O) unit Google on Tuesday for breaching EU antitrust rules after a seven-year investigation prompted by complaints from both sides of the Atlantic. The following is a summary of the EU decision and Google’s other regulatory issues. The fine represents 3 percent of Alphabet/Google’s turnover in 2016. The biggest sanction prior to that was U.S. chipmaker Intel’s (INTC.O) 1.06 billion euro fine in 2009. The Commission found that Google had systematically given prominent placement in searches to its own comparison shopping service and demoted those of rivals in search results.  The Commission wants the company to stop that, or face additional non-compliance payments of five percent of Alphabet’s average daily global turnover. The action came after a seven-year long investigation prompted by scores of complaints from rivals such as U.S. consumer review website Yelp (YELP.N), TripAdvisor (TRIP.O), UK price comparison site Foundem, News Corp (NWSA.O) and lobbying group FairSearch. Google may choose to appeal in EU courts, but Intel, the previous antitrust fine record holder, has waited seven years for a final judgment on its appeal. Google remains under Commission investigation in two other cases. These concern its Android mobile operating system, where the company is charged with “requiring and incentivising” manufacturers to prioritize its apps and web services, and Google’s “AdSense for Search” platform, allegedly used to restrict search ads from rivals. Google and other US-based internet companies face increasing scrutiny and regulation from the EU regarding user privacy and data storage, most recently on messaging, email and voice services. The EU largely expects greater cooperation from tech companies on cyber security and counter-terrorism. Last week’s European Council Summit called for the industry to step up efforts to remove extremist content and disrupt communication support for terrorist acts.  On Monday, Facebook , Google’s YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft responded with the announcement of a Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism. The Commission has a number of ongoing cases involving technology giants, notably Qualcomm which was accused in 2015 of using financial incentives and predatory pricing to force out competition. In early June, the Commission opened an additional investigation into Qualcomm’s $38 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors.

757,QCOM,"Qualcomm accuses Apple of infringing six patents in iPhone, iPad","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc will ask the U.S. International Trade Commission to bar Apple Inc from selling some iPhones and iPads in the United States that use chips made by competitor Intel Corp on the grounds that the devices infringe on six Qualcomm patents. In a request that would broaden its legal battle with Apple, San Diego-based Qualcomm said it will ask the U.S. ITC to ban imports of the infringing Apple devices. A related lawsuit was filed in federal court in California on Thursday to request monetary damages. Qualcomm, which also supplies chips to Apple, said the six patents help devices perform well without draining the battery. Apple referred reporters to its earlier comments on the dispute with Qualcomm, which accuse Qualcomm of unfairly imposing what Apple calls a “tax” on Apple devices using Qualcomm chips. In its complaint to the ITC, Qualcomm asked the body to ban “iPhones that use cellular baseband processors other than those supplied by Qualcomm’s affiliates.” Qualcomm did not name Intel, but Intel began supplying chips for some iPhones starting with the iPhone 7. Qualcomm has not alleged that Intel chips violate its patents but claims that the way Apple implements them in the iPhone does. Intel declined comment. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said ITC cases typically take 16 months to conclude and the case was unlikely to affect Apple’s 10th anniversary iPhone launch expected this fall. “I doubt this puts a lot of immediate pressure on Apple,” Rasgon said. There has been long-running tension between Qualcomm and Apple over Qualcomm’s practice of taking a cut of the total price of the phone in exchange for “modem” chips that help phones use wireless networks data plans. The ITC is a popular venue for patent disputes because it handles cases relatively quickly and can more easily bar an infringing product from the U.S. market than federal courts. Animosity between the two companies burst into the open in January, when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm and accused it of using “anticompetitive” tactics to maintain its monopoly on a key semiconductor used in mobile phones. The FTC, which enforces antitrust law along with the Justice Department, said that Qualcomm used its dominant position as a supplier of certain chips to impose “onerous” supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers and to weaken competitors. Days later, Apple sued Qualcomm for $1 billion, accusing it of overcharging for chips and withholding promised rebates because of Apple’s discussions with South Korea’s antitrust regulators in their probe of Qualcomm.

Apple told its contract manufacturers to withhold license payments from Qualcomm while the dispute played out, which prompted Qualcomm to sue them in May. “Despite Apple’s claims against Qualcomm, Apple suppliers remain contractually obligated to pay royalties to Qualcomm under their license agreements with us, including for sales of iPhones to Apple,” Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said of the dispute on the company’s conference call in April. Much of the language in the contractors’ allegations mirror Apple’s objections to Qualcomm’s business model. A senior Apple official confirmed that the company is helping to fund the contractors’ legal defense as part of an indemnification agreement among the firms. Apple has also formally joined the contractor case as a defendant. The lost license revenue from Apple has been a hit to Qualcomm’s sales. Analysts expect $5.2 billion in revenue for the June quarter, down from $6 billion a year earlier.

774,QCOM,UPDATE 1-Tech group sides with Apple in Qualcomm's iPhone ban dispute,"(Reuters) - A group representing major technology companies has aligned itself against Qualcomm Inc in its legal dispute with Apple Inc by calling on regulators to reject Qualcomm’s bid to ban the import of iPhones. A lobbying group that represents Alphabet Inc’s Google, Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc filed comments with the U.S. International Trade Commission.  They argued that barring Apple from importing foreign-assembled iPhones that use Intel Corp chips - as Qualcomm has requested - would cause “significant shocks to supply” for phones and would hurt consumers. Qualcomm declined to comment. Intel and Apple rival Samsung are members of the group, called the Computer & Communications Industry Association. Apple is not a member of the group.  “If the ITC were to grant this exclusion order, it would help Qualcomm use its monopoly power for further leverage against Apple and allow them to drive up prices on consumer devices,” Ed Black, the CEO of the group, said in a statement. “What’s at stake here is certainly the availability of iPhones and other smartphones at better prices.” Qualcomm supplies so-called modem chips to Apple, which help iPhones and iPads connect to cellular data networks. The two have been locked in a sprawling legal battle in which Apple has objected to Qualcomm’s business model of requiring customers to sign patent license agreements before buying chips. In turn, Qualcomm has accused Apple of directing its contract manufacturers like Foxconn to withhold license payments in a bid to hurt Qualcomm. The conflict has taken a toll on Qualcomm’s profit outlook.  Earlier this month, Qualcomm sued Apple on separate allegations that Apple infringed six patents around making iPhones work better without draining the battery. Simultaneously, Qualcomm filed a complaint with the U.S. ITC seeking to ban iPhones that use chips “other than those supplied by Qualcomm affiliates.” Apple began using Intel chips in the iPhone 7.

777,QCOM,US STOCKS-Wall St flat as home improvement retailers get Amazoned,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks ended little changed on Wall Street on Thursday as a deal between Sears and Amazon weighed on home improvement retailers while gains in Microsoft helped buoy the Nasdaq. Retailers and appliance makers fell after Sears (SHLD.O) said it would sell its Kenmore home appliances on Amazon (AMZN.O) and integrate the brand’s smart gadgets with the online giant’s Alexa digital assistant. Sears was up 10.6 percent at $9.60 and Amazon shares rose 0.2 percent. Home Depot (HD.N) fell 4.1 percent, shaving off 40 points from the Dow and weighing the most on the S&P; 500. Retailers Lowes (LOW.N) and Best Buy (BBY.N), as well as appliance maker Whirlpool (WHR.N), were down between 3.9 and 5.6 percent. “I think a lot of earnings (beats) are due to the low-interest-rate environment. Once you see a tick up in rates, the earnings are going to be affected. But right now, it looks like it’s going to continue. Earnings overall are very strong,” said Anthony Conroy, president at Abel Noser in New York. Microsoft (MSFT.O) shares rose 0.9 percent in after-hours trading to $74.89 after it reported a quarterly profit that more than doubled, helped by a tax benefit and strong growth in its cloud business. Overall earnings continue to beat expectations and major indexes closed Thursday at or near all-time highs. Analysts are estimating an 8.6 percent rise in second-quarter earnings and a 4.6 percent increase in revenue for the S&P; 500 companies from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 28.97 points, or 0.13 percent, to close at 21,611.78, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 0.38 point, or 0.02 percent, to 2,473.45 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 4.96 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,390.00. Despite the market’s continued attention on business-friendly signs out of Washington, stocks did not react to the White House’s announcement it had withdrawn or removed from consideration more than 800 proposed regulations that were never finalized during the Obama administration. “It’s not going to make things any better, it just won’t make them worse,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. “I see no tangible evidence that these regulation pullbacks have helped the economy one iota.” T-Mobile (TMUS.O) gained as much as 3.3 percent after the wireless carrier’s quarterly results topped analysts’ estimates, but reversed course in the afternoon and closed down 1.4 percent at $61.12. Verizon (VZ.N) rose 1.8 percent and AT&T; (T.N) added 1.1 percent. Qualcomm (QCOM.O) fell 4.9 percent after the chipmaker’s forecast missed estimates and several Apple (AAPL.O) suppliers filed a lawsuit accusing Qualcomm of taking additional licensing money over the assemblage of iPhones. Property and casualty insurer Travelers (TRV.N) closed down 1.5 percent after reporting a drop in quarterly profit. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.14-to-1 ratio favored advancers. About 5.92 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.35 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

778,QCOM,Fingerprint Cards says teams up with Qualcomm as Q2 profit misses forecasts,"STOCKHOLM, July 21 (Reuters) - Swedish biometric firm Fingerprint Cards (FPC) said on Friday it had struck a deal to include its sensors in several Qualcomm products, after posting second-quarter earnings below market forecasts. The fingerprint sensor maker has warned on profits three times since the end of 2016, eroding confidence in the company, which - combined with sector oversupply and weakened demand from smartphone makers - has dented shares. FPC said in Friday’s report that the industry-wide inventory build-up of sensors, which had a negative impact on second quarter results, was now back to normal. “We have continued to secure important orders which will result in increasing market shares with some major customers,” CEO Christian Fredrikson said in a statement. In a separate statement FPC said its technology would be included in low- and mid-tier Snapdragon mobile platforms from Qualcomm. The company posted an operating profit of 72 million Swedish crowns ($8.75 million), lower than the 155 million seen by analysts in a Reuters poll, and sharply down from 710 million in the year-ago quarter. The gross margin, excluding provisions for an obsolescence reserve, remained at 42 percent. FPC scrapped its full-year guidance and stopped giving forecasts in March, after warning first-quarter revenues would decline by more than 50 percent due to weakened demand and inventory build-up. FPC’s customers are mainly Chinese smartphone makers such as Huawei and Oppo. It made its big breakthrough in 2015 as demand for fingerprint sensors in smartphones and tablets soared.

792,QCOM,Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,"LONDON (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week, and the Reuters stories related to them. 1/ JAW-JAW, SELL-SELL  An unnerving war of words between Washington and Pyongyang has pushed the cost of insuring South Korean debt against default to its highest in 1-1/2 years and the expected volatility of the Korean won is creeping higher. Gauges of market risk have been rising but are far off their peaks as the expectation still is that diplomacy would prevail and prevent a nuclear conflict. But investors are increasingly jittery and some are wondering what other threats to the benign environment in markets may be lurking below the radar. (Graphic: Korean markets reaction to U.S.-North Korea tensions reut.rs/2hPtW3Z) Immediate winners as tension ratcheted higher over the Korean peninsula were U.S. defense industry stocks. Raytheon, maker of the Patriot anti-missile system notched up an 8 percent gain for the month on the day of President Trump’s “fire and fury” warning, slightly outperforming Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon’s No. 1 weapons supplier.

793,QCOM,Qualcomm outlines impact of dispute with Apple after SEC request,"(Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc on Monday disclosed further details about the impact of an ongoing dispute with Apple Inc, responding to questions from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips used in smartphones,  said revenue in its CDMA technology business from modem sales for iPhones may continue to decline, in part depending on the extent of Apple’s utilization of rivals’ modems and the mix of the various versions that are sold.  Apple's dual sourcing does not impact the licensing revenue since licensing revenue from Apple products are not dependent upon whether such products include Qualcomm's chipsets, the company said in a regulatory filing. (bit.ly/2vC9aYP)  Qualcomm said it would give further details on the impact of Apple’s dual-sourcing model on product revenue, licensing revenue and profitability in its upcoming quarterly filing. Apple, which is using Intel Corp’s broadband modem chips in the iPhone 7, and Qualcomm are locked in a sprawling legal battle, with the iPad maker objecting to Qualcomm’s business model of requiring customers to sign patent license agreements before buying chips.  Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm’s revenue in fiscal 2016. The U.S. International Trade Commission agreed in August to look into a patent infringement complaint filed against Apple by Qualcomm in July, where it sought a bar on Apple selling some iPhones and iPads in the United States.

795,QCOM,GRAPHIC-Take Five: World markets themes for the week ahead,"(Repeats item moved on Friday; no change to text) LONDON, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week, and the Reuters stories related to them. 1/ JAW-JAW, SELL-SELL An unnerving war of words between Washington and Pyongyang has pushed the cost of insuring South Korean debt against default to its highest in 1 1/2 years and the expected volatility of the Korean won is creeping higher. Gauges of market risk have been rising but are far off their peaks as the expectation still is that diplomacy will prevail and prevent a nuclear conflict. But investors are increasingly jittery and some are wondering what other threats to the benign environment in markets may be lurking below the radar. North Korea warns of nuclear war; Trump says weapons ‘locked and loaded’ In Asia financial markets, the fear indicators still send a buy signal Trump stumps South Korean markets more than any missile tests Immediate winners as tension ratcheted higher over the Korean peninsula were U.S. defence industry stocks. Raytheon, maker of the Patriot anti-missile system, notched up an 8 percent gain for the month on the day of President Trump’s “fire and fury” warning, slightly outperforming Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon’s No. 1 weapons supplier. Overall, defence stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are up about 4.3 percent, more than twice the gains of the wider index. BUZZ-U.S. defense stocks fire up after Trump warns North Korea Lack of real-world testing raises doubts on U.S. missile defenses The dollar’s nearly 9 percent fall this year has exposed a stark divergence of fortunes between U.S. companies with high international sales and those that rely on domestic revenues.

800,QCOM,South Korean court rejects Qualcomm's request to suspend antitrust body's order,"SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean court on Monday rejected Qualcomm Inc’s (QCOM.O) request to suspend an order by the country’s antitrust agency to take corrective action on the way it licenses patents. In December, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fined Qualcomm 1.03 trillion won ($912.34 million) for what it called unfair business practices in patent licensing and modem chip sales. The regulator also ordered the U.S. firm to negotiate in good faith with rival chipmakers on patent licensing, and renegotiate chip supply agreements with mobile phone makers if requested. If the order is upheld, such measures would affect Qualcomm’s dealings with major tech firms including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. Qualcomm subsequently filed two lawsuits with the Seoul High Court, one calling for the nullification of the regulator’s decision and another seeking the suspension of the corrective order until a ruling on the first is made. The court turned down the suspension request because it did not believe the regulator’s order would pose a risk of “irreparable damage” to Qualcomm, a spokeswoman told Reuters. The court has not yet made a ruling on the first lawsuit calling for the cancellation of the regulator’s decision. A spokeswoman at Qualcomm’s South Korean’s unit did not have any immediate comment.

806,QCOM,"Apple lawsuits against Qualcomm can proceed, U.S. judge rules","(Reuters) - Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) 11 foreign lawsuits against Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) can proceed while the company’s dispute plays out in the United States, a U.S. federal judge in San Diego ruled Sept. 7. Qualcomm and Apple are facing off in federal court over Qualcomm’s licensing for modem chips, which provide mobile data connectivity to devices like the iPhone. Because those chips have become a standard across the mobile phone industry, Qualcomm is required to license them on fair terms. Apple has alleged that Qualcomm is charging unfair prices for the technology and is engaging in anticompetitive practices. Qualcomm, for its part, has said that it provided fair terms for the parts of technology where it is obligated to do so and that it is within its rights to determine pricing on patents that are not bound by the standards rules. Qualcomm had sought what is known as an “anti-suit” injunction against Apple, seeking to temporarily halt 11 separate lawsuits against Qualcomm and its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Japan, China and Taiwan over many of the same pricing and practices issues as the U.S. case. But Judge Gonzalo Curiel ruled against Qualcomm and said Apple could proceed with those actions while the U.S. case plays out. “Apple’s declarations make evident that it has sought to challenge Qualcomm’s patent licensing practices and anticompetitive conduct territory by territory,” Curiel wrote. “While Qualcomm may object to this litigation strategy as duplicative, the Court will not conclude that Apple’s exercise of its rights under foreign laws is vexatious.” Christine Trimble, vice president of public affairs at Qualcomm, said in a statement, “While we are disappointed by today’s rulings, we recognize that the motions involved high procedural hurdles.”  Apple praised the ruling.       “We are pleased the federal court in San Diego decided Qualcomm must establish the fair value of its technology and defend its business practices in court before forcing Apple and others to pay exorbitant and unfair rates, which amount to a tax on our own inventions,” Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said in a statement. Qualcomm has also brought an action against Apple before the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban imports of some iPhones. Qualcomm filed a separate civil lawsuit accusing Apple of infringing the patents at issue in that action. Qualcomm also faces an antitrust complaint from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Meantime, four of Apple’s contract manufacturers sued Qualcomm on antitrust allegations, and Apple joined that lawsuit.

But Judge Gonzalo Curiel ruled against Qualcomm and said Apple could proceed with those actions while the U.S. case plays out. “Apple’s declarations make evident that it has sought to challenge Qualcomm’s patent licensing practices and anticompetitive conduct territory by territory,” Curiel wrote. “While Qualcomm may object to this litigation strategy as duplicative, the Court will not conclude that Apple’s exercise of its rights under foreign laws is vexatious.” Christine Trimble, vice president of public affairs at Qualcomm, said in a statement, “While we are disappointed by today’s rulings, we recognize that the motions involved high procedural hurdles.”  Apple praised the ruling.       “We are pleased the federal court in San Diego decided Qualcomm must establish the fair value of its technology and defend its business practices in court before forcing Apple and others to pay exorbitant and unfair rates, which amount to a tax on our own inventions,” Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said in a statement. Qualcomm has also brought an action against Apple before the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban imports of some iPhones. Qualcomm filed a separate civil lawsuit accusing Apple of infringing the patents at issue in that action. Qualcomm also faces an antitrust complaint from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Meantime, four of Apple’s contract manufacturers sued Qualcomm on antitrust allegations, and Apple joined that lawsuit.

810,QCOM,UPDATE 1-5G phones to go mainstream in key markets in 2019 - Qualcomm CEO,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The first 5G phones ready to meet next-generation mobile standards will be available for the mass market in 2019 - a year ahead of most predictions - in several Asian countries and the United States, Qualcomm’s CEO said on Thursday.  Steven Mollenkopf, chief executive of the world’s top maker of smartphone chips, said in an interview that rising consumer and business demands were forcing the industry to accelerate its previous 2020 timeline to upgrade to new networks and devices. “You will see it (5G) in real devices, on the shelf, in 2019. And if I were to answer that same question a year ago, I would have said 2020”, Mollenkopf said in an interview on the sidelines of the Frankfurt Motor Show. Commercialisation of 5G is vital to the fortunes of makers of network equipment gear such as Huawei [HWT.UL], Nokia and Ericsson, as well as device makers like Samsung Electronics and Apple by enabling demand for new features and equipment upgrades.  Moving to new networks promises to enable new mobile services and even whole new business models, but could pose challenges for industries unable to invest in upgrades. Unlike the prior upgrades of cellular standards 2G in the early 1990s, 3G just around the millennium and 4G in 2010, 5G standards will deliver not just faster phone or computer data but link up cars, machines, cargo and crop equipment to the Internet. The Qualcomm executive said South Korea, Japan and the United States all now had several network operators in each market preparing mainstream network launches in 2019, with China likely to join this early wave rather than hanging behind. “I think you will see the typical first movers - Korea, Japan and the United States,” he said referring to the history of 3G and 4G cellular network upgrades, when South Korea and Japan moved first and the United States quickly followed. “You will see robust demand in all of those locations, meaning that there are multiple operators wanting to be first and not be left behind. (Most) will have a different deployment strategy or goal,” he said, fuelling competition for new users. China, far and away the world’s largest market for phones, has traditionally lagged behind these early adopters, but Mollenkopf said they are likely to join the first movers to 5G. “What we are seeing in China is a real desire not to be a follower and to launch with everyone else. That’s new this time.” “From a geopolitical perspective, certain regions of the world just don’t want to be late to that game,” he said. The Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, in February 2018 are expected to be the first widespread public showcase for 5G services.

812,QCOM,Autoliv lifts shares with plans to split into two listed companies,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden’s Autoliv (ALIVsdb.ST) (ALV.N) said it planned to split into two listed companies, with one focused on high-tech safety gear to capture the rapid growth toward self-driving vehicles, lifting its shares on Thursday. Autoliv is the biggest player by far in the market for safety gear such as airbags and seatbelts which generate the bulk of its earnings. It has yet to reach a dominant position in new fields such as radar, visions systems and driver assistance software that are key for development of self-driving cars. The company believes both businesses are undervalued and hopes the split will make them more appealing to investors. “A reason to do this is to clarify the potential in these businesses,” Autoliv Chief Executive Jan Carlson told Reuters. “To show the strength of possibly the world’s strongest product portfolio in electronics as well as the strong development we have in passive safety.” Investors have been putting pressure on car makers and their suppliers to more clearly identify the growth parts of their businesses, areas such as automated driving, electrification and digital technology. Delphi Automotive (DLPH.N), another major auto supplier, recently announced plans to separate into two entities - one dedicated to internal combustion technology and the other focused on electrification and automation. Autoliv said its listing could happen in about a year, but added that while that was the company’s intention, it was not ruling out alternatives. Analysts at Jefferies noted in a research note the  consolidation opportunities in the electronics business. Autoliv’s Stockholm-listed shares (ALIVsdb.ST) jumped as much as 12 percent and were up 10.5 percent at 1323 GMT. “The split will clearly help to bring the true value of Autoliv’s excellent market positions and strong product offering to the surface,” said John Hernander of Nordea, the firm’s fifth largest shareholder. Autoliv has seen major market share gains on order intake in its traditional, passive safety business over the past two years following the collapse of Japanese rival Takata. But the auto industry’s long lead times have meant that Autoliv is only now starting to reap the full benefits of those business wins, while strong orders in its electronics business will only gradually filter through into sales in coming years.  Extra spending needed to deliver the influx of orders in recent years and technology investments needed have weighed on the stock, while worries have mounted over slower growth in the global car market. Autoliv’s U.S.-listed shares (ALV.N) are flat so far this year, lagging a 16 percent rise in the Dow Jones U.S. Automobiles & Parts Index .DJUSAP. Global carmakers and electronics firms such as Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) are racing to develop the emerging technology of autonomous vehicles. In electronics, Autoliv’s recent tie-ups include a joint venture with Geely-owned Volvo Cars, and partnerships with chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA.O), as well as Velodyne over LiDar technology.     The company said it expected sales to top $12 billion in 2019 while analysts are on average forecasting sales of $11.9 billion in 2019, Thomson Reuters data shows. It also gave sales and profit forecasts for the separate entities for 2020, giving further upside to consensus forecasts, according to Jefferies.

Adams, who will also be senior vice president of legal and global security, will report to Chief Executive Tim Cook, the company said.  Before joining Honeywell in 2003, Adams was an attorney with Sidley Austin LLP in New York. Earlier, she had served as a clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and for Stephen Breyer, who was then an appeals court judge but later was appointed to the Supreme Court. Sewell, who has been Apple’s general counsel since 2009, will retire at the end of the year, the company said. Sewell, who came to Apple from Intel Corp (INTC.O), guided Apple through its massive patent infringement lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) over design patents for the original iPhone, a case that is still simmering nearly six years after it was filed and eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court. A U.S. appeals court is currently working to decide the final amount of damages Samsung owes Apple. In taking the legal reins at Apple, Adams will take over a wide-ranging dispute with Qualcomm over how that chipmaker licenses its technology to Apple. At the heart of the dispute is Qualcomm’s long-held practice of charging a percentage of the total price of iPhones and other Apple devices as a licensing fee for its mobile connectivity patent portfolio. Apple has sued Qualcomm over that practice in U.S. civil courts as well as 11 foreign jurisdictions.    Qualcomm has brought an action against Apple before the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban imports of some iPhones.

822,QCOM,NVIDIA unveils next-generation platform for fully autonomous cars,"LONDON (Reuters) - Silicon Valley graphics chipmaker NVIDIA unveiled on Tuesday the first computer chips for developing fully autonomous vehicles and said it had more than 25 customers working to build a new class of driverless cars, robotaxis and long-haul trucks. Deutsche Post DHL Group, the world’s largest mail and logistics company, and ZF [ZFF.UL], a top automotive parts supplier, plan to deploy a fleet of autonomous delivery trucks based on the new chips, starting in 2019, NVIDIA said. The third generation of NVIDIA’s Drive PX automotive line, code-named Pegasus, is a multi-chip platform the size of car license plates with datacenter-class processing power.  Pegasus can handle 320 trillion operations per second, representing roughly a 13-fold increase over the calculating power of the current PX 2 line.  A single NVIDIA Xavier-class processor can be used for level 3 semi-autonomous driving, while a combination of multiple mobile and graphics processors would run level 5 full-scale driverless cars, the company said.  A level 5 vehicle is capable of navigating roads without any driver input and in its purest form would have no steering wheel or brakes. A level 3 car still needs a steering wheel and a driver who can take over if the car encounters a problem, while level 4 promises driverless features in dedicated lanes.   This dramatic improvement is a pre-condition for developing and testing future autonomous cars, experts said.  Shares of Nvidia were indicated 3.8 percent higher in pre-market U.S. trading at $192.37. The high-flying stock has gained 80 percent this year. “NVIDIA is one step ahead. But you can be sure you can expect (rival chipmakers) Intel, NXP and Renesas not to be too far behind,” said Luca De Ambroggi, principal automotive electronics analyst with industry market research firm IHS Markit.  U.S. computer chip giant Intel and its Mobileye automotive unit are working with German carmaker BMW and U.S. auto supplier Delphi on their own autonomous driving platform due out in 2021.  NXP has agreed to be acquired by Qualcomm to form the world’s largest auto electronics supplier. Japanese chipmaker Renesas is a has a strong presence in microcontrollers used to run key car functions. NVIDIA’s automotive director Danny Shapiro said in an interview that many of the first 25 customers using the Pegasus platform would focus on robotaxis, which will be built without steering wheels or brakes and used only on dedicated routes. Bigger name automakers will announce vehicles running on Pegasus at their own product launches in coming months, he said. The Pegasus line will be available by the middle of 2018 for automakers to begin developing vehicles and testing software algorithms needed to control future driverless cars, NVIDIA executives told a developers’ conference in Munich on Tuesday.   The deal between Deutsche Post, ZF and NVIDIA will include future Deutsche Post StreetScooter delivery trucks. In Munich, the three partners are showcasing a prototype StreetScooter running NVIDIA Drive PX chips used to control sensors including six cameras, one radar and one lidar, or 3D laser camera. Initial use cases will be for logistics vehicles on private roads within freight centers or for long-haul trucking in dedicated lanes, Shapiro said: “They are not replacing the drivers, but making the drivers more efficient and safer”. For its current generation Drive PX2, NVIDIA has said it has 225 customers, including car and truck makers, Tier 1 auto suppliers, high-definition mapping companies, start-ups and research institutions. These customers can make use of PX2-class software when they upgrade to Pegasus chips, NVIDIA said.  These could encompass existing customers Tesla, including its latest Model 3. Others include Volkswagen’s  (VOWG_p.DE) Audi A8, the first car to use Level 3 semi-autonomous driving features, Toyota Motor’s next-generation autonomous cars and Geely’s Volvo business.  De Ambroggi said NVIDIA’s Pegasus automotive platform was the first with the processing power for automakers to begin developing truly autonomous vehicles, which could be upgraded with software improvements ahead of actual roadway deployments.  But the analyst stressed that while Pegasus could find its way into mass-produced robotaxis running in defined lanes, these early fully-autonomous chips would likely only allow carmakers to develop prototypes ready for the driverless era. Regulations, road-testing, nagging safety concerns - and questions about how power-intensive the new data-hungry chip platform will be - are likely to mean truly driverless cars for personal use won’t arrive until at least 2025, he said.

These customers can make use of PX2-class software when they upgrade to Pegasus chips, NVIDIA said. These could encompass existing customers Tesla, including its latest Model 3. Others include Volkswagen’s Audi A8, the first car to use Level 3 semi-autonomous driving features, Toyota Motor’s next-generation autonomous cars and Geely’s Volvo business. De Ambroggi said NVIDIA’s Pegasus automotive chips were the first chips with the processing power for automakers to begin developing truly autonomous vehicles, which could be upgraded with software improvements ahead of actual roadway deployments. But the analyst stressed that while such chips could find their way into mass-produced robotaxis running in defined lanes, these early fully-autonomous chips would likely only allow carmakers to develop prototypes ready for the driverless era. Regulations, road-testing, nagging safety concerns - and questions about how power-intensive the new data-hungry chips will be - are likely to mean truly driverless cars for personal use won’t arrive until at least 2025, he said.

825,QCOM,Taiwan fines Qualcomm $774 million for antitrust violations,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) faces an antitrust fine in Taiwan, the latest in a years-long streak of regulatory setbacks to its business model that comes as it also fights U.S. regulators and iPhone maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in court over many of the same legal issues. The Taiwan Fair Trade Commission said on Wednesday it would fine Qualcomm T$23.4 billion ($774.14 million) for anti-trust violations of its chip technology. The Commission said in a Chinese-language statement that Qualcomm had a monopoly over the chip market for several so-called modem technologies, which provide wireless data connectivity for mobile phones, and refused to license its technology to other industry players. In Taiwan, Qualcomm is required to submit a progress report on the matter every six months to the Commission on negotiations with related parties. In a statement, Qualcomm said it disagreed with the decision. Once the final decision is issued in the coming weeks, Qualcomm said it will challenge the decision in court. “The fine bears no rational relationship to the amount of Qualcomm’s revenues or activities in Taiwan, and Qualcomm will appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it,” Qualcomm said. The Taiwanese decision is the latest challenge to Qualcomm’s business model, which involves selling chips and also licensing a suite of patents related to how those chips are put into a phone to provide mobile data to the device. While the regulatory and legal attacks differ in some details, a key theme is the allegation that Qualcomm uses its dominant position in the market for modem chips to charge unfair royalty rates for its patents.  Last December, Korean regulators fined Qualcomm $854 million for violating its competition laws, a ruling that followed an $975 million fine from Chinese regulators in 2015. European regulators have also expressed antitrust concerns over Qualcomm’s $38 billion bid to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O). The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also suing Qualcomm over its licensing practices. Those regulatory challenges are playing out as Apple is waging a global legal battle on Qualcomm’s long-held practice of charging a percentage of the total price of iPhones and other Apple devices as a licensing fee for its patents.  After those lawsuits were filed, Qualcomm brought an action against Apple before the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban imports of some iPhones. Qualcomm filed a separate civil lawsuit accusing Apple of infringing the patents at issue in that action.

834,QCOM,Patently tough: Long road ahead for Qualcomm in China case against Apple,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc wants to hit Apple Inc where it hurts most: iPhone sales in China - one of its biggest global markets where most of its flagship smartphones are made. The U.S. chipmaker’s legal gambit to ban sales and manufacturing of iPhones could cripple global supply of Apple’s most important product, legal experts say, but many believe Qualcomm faces a stiff battle to get there.  Instead, Qualcomm may be looking to frustrate the tech giant through a lengthy legal fight that could last years in China as it seeks to gain leverage in the firms’ global standoff over royalty payments it demands, intellectual property lawyers said. Qualcomm said this week it had filed the suits in Beijing’s intellectual property court, claiming patent infringement against Apple. If successful Apple could be blocked from selling or manufacturing some iPhones in China. The two firms are fighting on multiple fronts around the globe from the United States to Europe and Asia, but the China case is particularly thorny because the iPhone is almost entirely made in the country by contract manufacturer Foxconn. “Effectively - if they get an injunction - you would have a worldwide injunction that would block (Apple) exports from China,” said Erick Robinson, director of patent litigation for Beijing East IP and a former director of patents for Qualcomm. “China is still unpredictable and Apple has a ton to lose.” Apple has antitrust suits against Qualcomm in the United States as well as nearly a dozen in the United Kingdom, Japan, China and Taiwan alleging that Qualcomm is charging unfair prices for its technology.  In return, Qualcomm is seeking injunctions against Apple in the United States with complaints to the International Trade Commission as well as filing complaints in Germany. Now it has set it sights on China. But putting Apple away in China is a tough act, lawyers said.  Apple suppliers employ hundreds of thousands of people in China, so authorities may be wary of hitting jobs with a ban on production. More to the point, lawyers said it was unlikely either firm would allow the case to get to an injunction, speculating that  Qualcomm’s main aim was to increase its leverage over Apple at the negotiating table over any final settlement. A Shanghai-based intellectual property lawyer said it would take “a year or two” to get to the point where the threat of injunction was imminent, but that eventually it would get “too close for comfort”.  “The consequences are just dire if (an injunction) were to actually happen, the lawyer, who asked not to be named because Qualcomm and Apple were clients of his firm, said.  “That is very significant leverage Qualcomm would have over Apple.”  The chipmaker has not made public which iPhone models would be included, but Christine Trimble, a spokeswoman for Qualcomm, said it would cover the iPhone 7. The patents include power savings technologies and Apple’s Force Touch feature in newer iPhones.      “The patents we’re asserting in these complaints are non-cellular wireless technologies that Apple uses in its iPhones,” Trimble told Reuters. “The patents are a few examples of the many Qualcomm technologies that Apple is using without paying Qualcomm.” Apple, which has said previously it pays fair and reasonable rates for the patents it uses, said Qualcomm’s claim is “meritless.” “Regulators around the world have found Qualcomm guilty of abusing their position for years. This claim is meritless and, like their other courtroom maneuvers, we believe this latest legal effort will fail,” said a Apple spokeswoman in Shanghai. Chinese regulators fined Qualcomm $975 million in 2015 over antitrust violations. Taiwan’s Fair Trade Commission said last week it would fine the firm $774 million over similar issues. Lawyers said Apple would likely file more unfair competition or anti-trust cases against Qualcomm in Chinese courts, or seek to get the relevant patents invalidated by the Chinese patent office. The iPhone maker could also seek to have the patent cases held up by the Beijing IP court while the patent invalidation decision was being made. The cases would then go through a series of hearings at the Beijing court before any injunction. “Given the known circumstances and the parties, an injunction is unlikely to be forthcoming in this type of situation,” said Elliot Papageorgiou, head of intellectual property at Clyde & Co China. Last year, a Beijing court banned Apple’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models, saying they were too similar in design to the Shenzhen Baili 100C smartphone. The ruling was overturned this year in favor of Apple. Injunction requests, often used to boost leverage in negotiations, have not proved hugely effective in patent litigations, however. By the time a court makes a ruling on such cases, the products involved in the suit often become outdated and defending firms introduce new models that do not use disputed patents.    “The reality is both parties should get together and avoid mutually assured destruction,” said Beijing-based Robinson, who estimated it would be 18 months before any potential injunction. “Apple has been giving Qualcomm trouble in the United States and in China; Qualcomm has the patent portfolio to completely block the manufacturing chain for Apple if that’s what they want to do.” ",10172017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-qualcomm-china-analysis/patently-tough-long-road-ahead-for-qualcomm-in-china-case-against-apple-idUSKBN1CM1A0

846,QCOM,"Demand for modem, IoT chips helps Qualcomm top estimates","(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc’s fourth-quarter profit and revenue beat market expectations as strength in its smartphone chips business was complemented by demand for chips used in automobiles and for the Internet of Things (IoT). Qualcomm, which has been fighting a legal battle on many fronts with Apple Inc, said revenue from areas other than smartphones was more than $3 billion in its latest fiscal year, up more than 25 percent from last year. Revenue from Qualcomm’s chip unit, which supplies both Android smartphone makers and Apple, rose 13 percent in the latest quarter. Licensing revenue, which includes royalties mostly from Apple, sank 36 percent. Reuters reported earlier this week that Apple would drop the Qualcomm’s chips altogether from its iPhones and iPads from next year, the latest salvo in a longstanding dispute between the two companies. Apple sued Qualcomm in January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and of refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Qualcomm also sued some Apple contract manufacturers in April over royalty payments and is trying to ban the sale of iPhones in China. “We really try to compartmentalize our engagement with Apple ... (and) we do have a lot of engagement with the company and we do speak in our engage on a daily basis with them across multiple areas,” Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf told analysts on a conference call. Qualcomm continues to exclude from its forecast revenue related to the sale of Apple products by the iPhone maker’s contract manufacturers as well as the another licensee in dispute. It forecast current-quarter revenue of $5.5 billion to $6.3 billion and adjusted earnings of 88 cents to 95 cents per share. Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.90 billion and a profit of 90 cents per share, per Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While Qualcomm and Apple would be better off with each other, Qualcomm will do just fine even if that’s not the case, Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead said. Qualcomm also reported better-than expected profit and sales for the fourth quarter, despite earnings tumbling nearly 90 percent due to a $778 million charge related to a fine imposed by the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission for anti-trust violations. The company' adjusted earnings of 92 cents per share beat estimates of 81 cents. Revenue fell 4.5 percent to $5.91 billion, but topped estimates of $5.80 billion.

848,QCOM,"Qualcomm, JMC seek to exit Alphabet-backed New York WiFi project -sources","SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc and private equity firm JMC Capital Partners are looking to sell their stakes in a joint venture that operates more than 1,300 free WiFi kiosks fashioned from old phone booths around New York City, according to people familiar with the matter. The move is the latest twist in the project overseen by Daniel Doctoroff, former chief executive of news and data provider Bloomberg LP and former deputy mayor of New York City. He now runs Sidewalk Labs, an urban development unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc. Doctoroff is chairman of a Sidewalk Labs subsidiary that is the top investor in the joint venture. Qualcomm and JMC are working with an investment bank to explore the sale of their stakes in CityBridge, the venture that is behind the LinkNYC WiFi project, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Qualcomm is seeking to exit the venture because it views it as non-core, while the private equity firm JMC is aiming to generate a profitable return on its investment, the people said. Qualcomm and Sidewalk Labs declined to comment. JMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for New York City’s Information Technology & Telecommunications Department said in a statement that the city would have to approve any changes and so far “nothing has been presented to us. Any decision we make has to center around continuing the success of the program and ensuring New Yorkers’ best interests are met.” LinkNYC emerged in 2014 as part of a 12-year contract with New York City to replace 7,500 payphone stands and was expected to generate $500 million in revenue for the city’s coffers. LinkNYC said on Wednesday that since they launched in 2016 more than 2.7 million people had registered to use the kiosks, which also have phone charging stations and free calling services. Qualcomm and JMC each invested about $25 million into the joint venture in 2014, the sources said. Another $50 million came from an outdoor advertising company and a software firm that were later bought by Sidewalk Labs and merged under the name Intersection. LinkNYC kiosks generate revenue through ad sales. Sidewalk Labs, which already owns more half of the joint venture through Intersection, could be a potential acquirer of the stakes, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Sidewalk Labs declined to comment on its potential interest. Large wireless carriers such as Verizon Communications and AT&T; could potentially be good partners as well in the joint venture, according to the sources. Verizon and AT&T; could not immediately be reached for comment. Sidewalk Labs’ Intersection expanded its network of Internet kiosks to London in June, turning on the first of 1,000 expected to be installed with Britain broadband provider BT and a local advertising firm. On Wednesday, Sidewalk Labs announced plans to open 100 kiosks in Philadelphia without any business partners starting next year. (Reporting by Liana B.

856,QCOM,UPDATE 5-Broadcom plans record tech deal with Qualcomm bid -sources,"(Reuters) - Communications chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) is planning to unveil a bid for smartphone chip supplier Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) by Monday, three sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, an attempt to create a roughly $200-billion company through the biggest technology acquisition ever. A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.  The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.  Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.  “It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.  Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California. Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago. The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources. Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported. Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips. Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.  The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets. Intel shares fell 1.6 percent to $46.34.  Broadcom is considering a cash and stock offer of about $70 a share, Bloomberg reported earlier. bloom.bg/2h8pnlS Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of  Brocade Communications Systems Inc BRCD.O while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP.    Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.  Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.  Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources. Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones. Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device. Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.  Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said. Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney. Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights. “These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that   asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal. Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues. Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California. Broadcom plans to complete that change before completing any Qualcomm deal, avoiding scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, according to one of the sources.

860,QCOM,Broadcom plans record tech deal with Qualcomm bid: sources,"(Reuters) - Communications chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) is planning to unveil a bid for smartphone chip supplier Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) by Monday, three sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, an attempt to create a roughly $200-billion company through the biggest technology acquisition ever. A tie-up would combine two of the largest makers of wireless communications chips for mobile phones and raises the stakes for Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has been diversifying into smartphone technology from its stronghold in computers.  The value of Broadcom’s bid has not been decided, though an offer in the range of around $70 to $80 per share is being contemplated, one of the sources said. At $70 a share, an offer would value Qualcomm at $103 billion.  Qualcomm is not aware of the details of Broadcom’s bid, and it is far from certain whether it will entertain this deal, the sources said.  “It’s a smart move that would make Broadcom into a tech juggernaut,” said GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives.  Qualcomm declined to comment, while Broadcom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The bid comes as Broadcom plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore. U.S. President Donald Trump commented on the move on Thursday at a White House event where Chief Executive Hock Tan cited Republican tax efforts. It is currently incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California. Broadcom’s acquisition would be the most ambitious move by Tan, who has turned a small, scrappy chipmaker into a $100-billion company with a string of deals, since he took the helm a decade ago. The proposal comes as Qualcomm is trying to close its pending $38-billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O). NXP is one of the largest makers of chips for vehicles and expanding into self-driving technology, and Broadcom also is open to acquiring NXP, according to one of the sources. Antitrust officials, who also would have to approve a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, are still considering Qualcomm’s purchase of NXP. Activist investor Elliott Management Corp has taken a large stake in NXP and has been pushing for Qualcomm to pay a higher price for the company, Reuters has reported. Qualcomm, an early pioneer in mobile phone chips, supplies so-called modem chips to phone makers such as Apple, Samsung and LG that help the phones connect to wireless data networks. Broadcom is also a major supplier to many of the same companies for Wi-Fi chips. Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chips are essentially a commodity and priced much lower than the modem chips.  The only other major supplier of high-end chips is Intel Corp (INTC.O), which supplies about half of the modem chips in Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPhones. Purchasing Qualcomm would give Broadcom a much more lucrative line of business in the mobile phone markets. Intel shares fell 1.6 percent to $46.34.  Broadcom is considering a cash and stock offer of about $70 a share, Bloomberg reported earlier. bloom.bg/2h8pnlS Broadcom is looking to complete its $5.5 billion purchase of  Brocade Communications Systems Inc BRCD.O while Qualcomm is in the process of closing its deal for NXP.    Shares of Qualcomm jumped 12.7 percent to $61.81, while Broadcom’s stock climbed nearly 6 percent to $273.63 on Friday afternoon. Shares of NXP fell 2 percent and Brocade slipped 2.6 percent.  Shares of Broadcom have rallied this year while Qualcomm has fallen, making the target more vulnerable. The forward price-to-earnings ratio for Broadcom recently stood at 14.6, slightly above its 13.5 average. Qualcomm’s recent forward PE of 15.4 was well below its 25.9 average.  Broadcom is working with five financing banks to offer a significant cash component for its bid, according to one of the sources. Qualcomm faces a multinational legal battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O) over Qualcomm’s licensing terms to Apple and Apple is considering dropping Qualcomm chips from its phones. Qualcomm sells chips but also licenses a patent portfolio of related technologies. It requires customers like Apple and Samsung to license its patents if they use its chips, typically asking for a percentage of the price of the final device. Apple has objected to that practice, however, and it has a closer relationship with Broadcom than with Qualcomm. If Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm’s patent portfolio and change the licensing, it could have far-reaching effects on the mobile phone industry.  Qualcomm and Broadcom have patent portfolios in wireless communications that are largely adjacent to each other, with Qualcomm covering mobile data networks and Broadcom covering WiFi and Bluetooth, experts said. Adjacent products are often cheaper when offered by one company, according to standard economic theory, which could be good for phone makers and potentially incline regulators toward allowing the deal, said Henry C. Su, a former Federal Trade Commission trial attorney. Antitrust concerns over a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal also may be muted because the companies have few areas of overlap beyond Wi-Fi solutions for wireless routers, Bluetooth drivers and some RF semiconductors, said Rob Lineback, a research analyst at IC Insights. “These companies are leaders in those areas but there are other companies supplying them,” said Lineback, who added that   asset sales in those areas, if needed to address antitrust concerns, would not affect the value of the deal. Kevin Krewell, principal analyst at Tirias Research, said that the deal would still make sense for Broadcom and Qualcomm if divestitures were needed to address antitrust issues. Broadcom may be able to skip review by regulators concerned about foreign ownership of U.S. assets, since it is moving its headquarters to California. Broadcom plans to complete that change before completing any Qualcomm deal, avoiding scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, according to one of the sources.

861,QCOM,"Broadcom bids $103 billion for Qualcomm, open to going hostile","(Reuters) - Chip maker Broadcom Ltd made an unsolicited $103 billion bid for Qualcomm Inc on Monday, setting the stage for a takeover battle that could reshape the industry at the heart of mobile phone hardware. Qualcomm said it would review the proposal but the San Diego-based company is inclined to reject the bid as too low and fraught with risk that regulators may reject it or take too long to approve it, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, who turned a small,  chipmaker into a $100-billion company based in Singapore and the United States, told Reuters he would not rule out a proxy fight to convince shareholders to replace the board and accept the offer.  “We are well advised and know what our options are, and we have not eliminated any of those options,” said Tan, who has pulled off a string of deals over the past decade. “We have a very strong desire to work with Qualcomm to reach a mutually beneficial deal.” A combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year. It would raise the stakes for Intel Corp, which has been diversifying from its stronghold in computers into smartphone technology by supplying modem chips to Apple Inc. Qualcomm shareholders, who have watched their investment sour over the past year in the face of a patent dispute with Apple, would get $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom stock in a deal, according to Broadcom’s proposal. Including debt, the transaction is worth $130 billion. “Now it’s a game of high-stakes poker for both sides,” said GBH Insight analyst Daniel Ives, who believes bullish investors were hoping for $75 to $80 per share. The offer represents a premium of 27.6 percent to Qualcomm’s closing price of $54.84 on Thursday. Shares of Qualcomm, whose chips allow phones to connect to wireless data networks, traded above $70 as recently as December 2016 and topped $80 in 2014. They rose 1.1 percent to $62.52, suggesting skepticism a deal would happen.  Broadcom shares rose 1.4 percent to $277.52 after touching a record of $281.80. Any deal struck between the two companies would face intense regulatory scrutiny, especially in China, which is home to expanding rivals. Chinese ambitions to buy U.S. chipmakers have been thwarted by U.S. regulators. Qualcomm sells modem chips that allow phones to send data as well as communications chips for automobiles that handle “infotainment” systems and wireless electric vehicle charging.  Qualcomm provides chips to carrier networks to deliver broadband and mobile data and is also in the process of closing a $38 billion bid for automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV that it made last year. Broadcom, Qualcomm and NXP together would have control over modems, Wi-Fi, GPS and near-field communications chips, a strong position that could concern customers such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd because of the bargaining power such a combined company could have to raise prices. However, a combined company would also likely have a lower cost base and the flexibility to cut prices. Herbert Hovenkamp, who teaches antitrust at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, said that U.S. regulators would try to ensure the deal would not lead to higher chip prices. “Based on what I’ve seen, it seems unlikely to me that there’s a basis for a challenge (to stop the deal),” he said. Tan added that if Broadcom acquires Qualcomm which in turn has acquired NXP, the combined company’s net debt could be in the range of $90 billion. Broadcom said BofA Merrill Lynch, Citi, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have advised that they are confident that they will be able to arrange the necessary financing for the proposed transaction. Broadcom also could spin out Qualcomm’s licensing arm, QTL, to get regulatory approval and funding for the deal, raising as much at $25 billion from a sale, Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah suggested. Broadcom had $5.25 billion in cash and cash equivalent as of July 30. Qualcomm had $35.03 billion in cash as of Sept. 24. Broadcom also got a commitment letter for $5 billion in financing from private equity Silver Lake Partners, an existing Broadcom investor. Qualcomm stock has fallen this year because of a patent fight with Apple, which could quit using Qualcomm chips in its phones, and concerns that it may have to raise its bid for a NXP. If Broadcom decides to make a hostile bid, Qualcomm’s governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 10-member board by a Dec. 7 nomination deadline. Two Qualcomm directors, Anthony Vinciquerra and Mark McLaughlin, have been aligned with activist hedge fund Jana Partners LLC, which pushed for a shakeup of the company two years ago. Jeffrey Henderson, another Qualcomm board director, was added last year as a compromise candidate. Apple, as a key customer, could play a key role. Analysts say that if Broadcom can salvage the Apple relationship, it would sharply increase potential returns from the takeover. Tan also has a history of cutting costs at acquired companies, and Charter Equity analyst Ed Snyder predicted Tan would cut away waste at Qualcomm. Broadcom plans to move its headquarters solely to the United States, which would allow it to avoid review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign ownership of U.S. assets.

862,QCOM,GLOBAL MARKETS-Oil surges to over two-year peak; Wall St climbs to record highs,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices surged to their highest since July 2015 on Monday as Saudi Arabia’s crown prince cemented his power with a crackdown on corruption, while shares worldwide were little changed and key currencies stayed in tight ranges. U.S. crude CLc1 broke above $56 a barrel for the first time in more than two years as Mohammed bin Salman’s clampdown on graft led to arrests of royals, ministers and investors, including prominent billionaire investor Alwaleed bin Talal. Brent crude futures LCOc1 were trading about 3.5 percent higher at $64.23 a barrel by 4:30 p.m. ET. Prince Mohammed’s reforms include a plan to list parts of state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco next year, with higher oil prices seen as beneficial for the market capitalization of the future listed company. The crackdown spurred concerns of Middle Eastern money pulling out of global financial markets.

870,QCOM,"Bargaining chip? China seen closely scrutinizing Qualcomm, Broadcom deal","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A potential mega-merger between chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) and U.S. rival Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) is likely to face stern scrutiny in China, antitrust lawyers say, amid a strategic push by Beijing into semiconductors. Broadcom made an unsolicited $103 billion bid for Qualcomm on Monday, aimed at creating a $200-billion-plus behemoth that could reshape the industry at the heart of mobile phone hardware. But Chinese regulatory approval could be a hold-up. Beijing and Washington have sparred over technology deals, including in chips, with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) knocking back a number of takeovers involving Chinese firms this year. The thorny topic is likely to come up when U.S. President Donald Trump visits China this week - with Qualcomm executives in tow. The merger would face a lengthy review from the anti-monopoly unit of China’s commerce ministry, due to strategic concerns, the huge size of the deal and because Qualcomm has come under fire before in the country over competition concerns. “This is a critical industry for China and Qualcomm has been fined by the Ministry of Commerce (Mofcom) before so it’s on its radar,” said Wendy Yan, Shanghai-based partner at law firm Faegre Baker Daniels. Qualcomm agreed to pay a record fine of $975 million in China in 2015 to end a probe into anti-competitive practices related to so-called “double dipping” by billing Chinese customers patent royalty fees in addition to charging for the chips. China is making a major push to develop its own semiconductor industry under local champions such as Tsinghua Unigroup and Fujian Grand Chip Investment  to help cut reliance on global operators including Qualcomm, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and Intel Corp (INTC.O). Beijing’s push adds a political edge to the case. “(Mofcom) will consider industry security for the whole country, as the semi-conductor industry has strategic importance to China,” a second Shanghai-based antitrust lawyer said, asking not to be named because Qualcomm was a client of his firm. China chipmaker rivals could also raise concerns about the deal, he added, putting pressure on Mofcom’s Anti-Monopoly Bureau to act. The most likely outcome would be restrictions on the deal rather than it being blocked, he said. Firms pursuing major takeovers must notify China before closing a deal if the merging companies’ combined global turnover in the previous year exceeded 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) or their combined China income exceeds 2 billion yuan - both easily hit in this case. Mofcom did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. The Shanghai-based antitrust lawyer said the size and complexity of the deal - and potential sensitivities - meant it would likely have to go through all three phases of Mofcom’s merger approval, on paper a 180-day process. While Broadcom and Qualcomm have little overlap, the firms are looking to complete a $5.5 billion purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc BRCD.O and a $38 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) respectively. Mofcom approved the Brocade acquisition with conditions earlier this year with after a five-month investigation. Qualcomm declined to comment. “We expect China, as with other countries, will welcome this deal as a solution to the double-dipping issue, and will find there are no significant issues beyond this,” a Broadcom spokeswoman said, referring to the patent charging issue. Last week, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said the company would move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore, citing Trump’s efforts to improve business conditions and reforming tax. Trump praised the move, calling Broadcom “one of the really great, great companies.” “Mofcom will be motivated by the government to look very closely not just from a competition perspective but also from a broader industrial policy perspective,” said another Beijing-based antitrust lawyer involved in similar transactions. The lawyer, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Beijing had been making a big push in the area including with deals to buy international firms - some successfully and some which had hit obstruction. “You should expect Mofcom will take a very, very close look at this transaction,” he said. Mofcom has been flexing its muscle more on global deals over the last few years, lawyers say, including putting restrictions on a deal between Dow Chemical and DuPont earlier this year. However, blocking deals outright was a rare step for Mofcom, especially when Chinese companies were not directly involved, several Chinese lawyers said. Instead, the firms may be asked to sell certain business units or make pledges to Chinese partners as conditions for it going ahead. “This case will be subject to more scrutiny from the Chinese authorities (than normal),” said Faegre Baker Daniels’ Yan. “I think it’s quite likely the deal will be subject to some restrictions from Mofcom.”   ",11072017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom-china-analysis/bargaining-chip-china-seen-closely-scrutinizing-qualcomm-broadcom-deal-idUSKBN1D706H
871,QCOM,UPDATE 1-Japan royalties help to drive profits higher for TowerJazz,"* TowerJazz forecast gets muted reception * Shares had risen by three quarters this year * Boosted by revenue from partnerships (Adds comments from CEO, analyst, details, share reaction) By Tova Cohen TEL AVIV, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Royalty payments from a joint venture in Japan with Panasonic helped boost quarterly net profit at Israeli chip manufacturer TowerJazz but shares fell on Tuesday after the fourth-quarter revenue forecast failed to inspire. TowerJazz, which specializes in analog chips used in cars, medical sensors and power management, reported third-quarter net profit of $55 million, up from $51 million a year earlier, as revenue rose 9 percent to $355 million. It was forecast to earn $49 million on revenue of $355 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. TowerJazz predicts fourth-quarter revenue will rise about 5 percent to $358 million, although it cautioned the figure could be in a range of 5 percent higher or lower than that. “The fourth quarter of 2016 was an exceptional quarter so it’s difficult to say this is a slowdown in our growth rate,” Chief Executive Russell Ellwanger told Reuters. “We can say that the market remains strong.” The $358 million revenue estimate was in line with analysts’ forecasts but failed to provide fresh momentum to shares which have surged 74 percent this year on Nasdaq. The stock slipped 3 percent in afternoon trade in Tel Aviv. “The shares were at a record high and since there was no surprise in the forecast beyond the consensus, investors took profits,” said one analyst in Tel Aviv. Full-year revenue is expected to rise 11 percent to $1.39 billion. Rather than building or buying factories at huge cost, TowerJazz’s strategy is to look for plants with idle capacity. It takes up that capacity while striking supply deals and offering other incentives such as a cut of profits and technical know-how. When asked how TowerJazz could be affected by the $103 billion bid by its customer Broadcom for Qualcomm, Ellwanger said in the past such consolidation has opened up opportunities for the company. As revenue at TowerJazz’s joint venture with Panasonic continues to grow, it reached a profitability level in the third quarter entailing royalty payments to both companies. TowerJazz said this, combined with improved revenue, accounted for the forecast-beating profit. In its latest partnership deal, TowerJazz is linking up with Tacoma Semiconductor Technology to establish a plant in China. It will not invest any money but will provide technological expertise in exchange for half the annual capacity. China is the company’s fastest growing region, Ellwanger said. “There’s no question things are happening in China,” he said, noting the company received an $18 million cash payment from Tacoma in the quarter - boosting quarterly free cash flow to a record $62 million - though a definitive agreement has yet to be signed. Ellwanger said he expects the signing of such an agreement by the first quarter of 2018, which would trigger more milestone payments.

874,QCOM,Breakingviews - Apple has deciding vote in Broadcom-Qualcomm deal,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Apple may anoint the winner of Broadcom’s $105 billion bid for Qualcomm. A dispute over iPhone royalties left the U.S. chipmaker vulnerable to an opportunistic offer from its acquisitive rival. Settling could preserve Qualcomm’s independence – but it all depends on whether Apple thinks a bigger Broadcom would be slavishly devoted to the handset maker, or just surlier. Qualcomm and Apple came to blows over royalties the chipmaker collects on mobile gadgets, most of which use its technologies. The actual payments aren’t disclosed, but analysts generally peg them at about $10 per phone. When Apple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm and told its suppliers to stop paying these fees earlier this year, it helped push Qualcomm’s share price down by $10 per share, in subsequent months, to the $54.84 at which it traded last Thursday, the day before Broadcom’s interest was reported. Settling might make the $70-per-share bid less compelling. Analysts project Apple should sell around 250 million phones next year. If it agreed a lower rate of, say, $7.50 per phone, with a post-tax margin of 85 percent, that would yield almost $1.6 billion in profit. Put this on a multiple of 10, and that’s worth about $16 billion – or roughly $11 per share. And that’s before any catch-up payments for previously withheld sums that Qualcomm might be able to claw back. Should Apple play along? It depends who the $905 billion smartphone maker thinks is a more malleable counterpart. Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan is open to renegotiating the Qualcomm contract should it prevail, according to people familiar with its thinking. The promise of $3 billion in annual cost savings from the merger more than defrays the opportunity cost of giving Apple a good deal. Winning the good graces of boss Tim Cook might also result in additional chip sales to the tech giant. Whatever Tan says, though, his priority is likely to be maximizing the returns on his new acquisition. A big motivation for acquiring rivals is usually gaining heft over customers, and Broadcom already derives over 10 percent of its revenue from Apple. Furthermore, the lengthy antitrust process for a Broadcom-Qualcomm merger means it might be a year before Tan could negotiate properly anyway. The maker may prefer its serfs smaller and more squeezable.",11092017,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-apple-has-deciding-vote-in-broadcom-qualcomm-deal-idUSKBN1D92LZ

879,QCOM,LPC: Lenders to embrace a record Broadcom bridge loan,"NEW YORK, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Banks are eager to open their wallets for what could be the biggest syndicated loan financing ever for an investment-grade acquisition, if chipmaker Broadcom’s unsolicited US$103bn bid to buy Qualcomm is accepted. With lending to back high-quality mergers and acquisitions down 18% this year from the same 10 months last year, bankers said they hope this deal comes to fruition and sets the stage for more dealflow. Five banks - Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley - told Broadcom they are “highly confident” they can arrange the funds needed for a takeover that is valued at US$130bn including debt. Broadcom is rated BBB- by S&P; and Baa2 by Moody’s. This tactic, often used for large hostile takeovers, allows borrowers to avoid paying fees on funds committed by banks to a huge deal that may not take place. Banks do not immediately tie up their balance sheets, while signaling to markets that financing will be there if the deal is approved. “We’ve been talking about when the first US$100bn deal is going to come for a while,” said one banker, adding there is plenty of demand to accommodate a funding of this size. “The attractiveness of something like this is the fees you get on the bonds.” Specific financing plans for the deal are not yet clear. If there is an initial bridge loan of around US$100bn, upfront fees to arranging banks would be at least US$100m - and possibly much more, according to Freeman Consulting Services. If roughly US$100bn of investment-grade bonds are issued later, banks would earn an additional US$400m to US$600m in underwriting fees. Asked about the risks of underwriting a jumbo bridge at a time of potential geopolitical upheaval, the head of investment banking at one of the banks involved said: “Yes, there are idiosyncratic risks out there, but the markets feel pretty good. If it were a Single B rated deal it would be a different story, but we are confident about providing a bridge for a deal like this at the moment.” The bridge financing is likely to exceed the record US$75bn loan that backed Belgium-based global brewer AB InBev’s takeover of SABMiller in 2015. Verizon Communications’ US$61bn bridge loan in 2013 to acquire the stake in Verizon Wireless it didn’t already own from Vodafone is the second-biggest such deal globally and the largest US bridge loan. German drug and chemical company Bayer backed its takeover of US seed company Monsanto with a US$57bn bridge loan, the third-biggest loan. “The questions are how long will banks hold the risk on their books, how fast can banks de-risk and how big of a bond deal can you do in a single gulp?” the first banker said. “The biggest single gulp has been Verizon’s US$49bn bonds, and the market is clearly more robust now than it was then.” The high-grade corporate bond market saw its busiest October issuance ever, at US$131bn, while dealer inventories were at their highest since July 2014. Such a large new bond issue would likely become part of indexes that investors use as benchmarks, and investors as a result would need to add exposure, several bankers said. “We haven’t heard how much they’re going to raise, but obviously it will be very big numbers and it will be interesting to see what ratings emerge,” a third banker said. “My guess is that the debt will be priced to move.” Along with bonds, permanent financing is likely to include short-dated term loans of varied maturities, helping assure rating agencies of the merged company’s deleveraging plans, this banker said. Broadcom told Reuters that it would not rule out a proxy fight to push this merger, which is seen reshaping the industry at the core of mobile phone hardware. In addition to the initial bank group’s highly confident letters, Silver Lake Partners committed to provide Broadcom with US$5bn of convertible debt financing. Without US tax reform one year into the Trump administration, mergers have mostly been by companies seeking growth by buying complementary businesses while expecting little regulatory push-back. Earlier in the year, two major proposed health insurance mergers – Aetna with Humana and Cigna with Anthem – were scrapped by separate antitrust rulings. The US Department of Justice is now pushing AT&T; to shed key assets to satisfy antitrust concerns, clouding the timing of the deal’s close. As some mergers drag on, and US tax policy debates escalate, attention strongly shifts to Broadcom. “All eyes are on Broadcom,” said the third banker. “This deal might persuade other companies to redouble efforts or take a fresh look at something they might have shelved because of tax and other uncertainties in Washington.” ",11102017,http://www.reuters.com/article/broadcom-bankerseager/lpc-lenders-to-embrace-a-record-broadcom-bridge-loan-idUSL1N1NG0UQ

Broadcom said it would seek to engage with Qualcomm’s board and management, adding that it had received positive feedback from key customers and stockholders.  “We continue to believe our proposal represents the most attractive, value-enhancing alternative available to Qualcomm stockholders and we are encouraged by their reaction,” the company said. Both companies count Apple among their top customers. Analysts have said a deal between the two would help Qualcomm settle its legal battle with the iPhone maker as Broadcom has a closer relationship with Apple. Broadcom made an unsolicited bid last week to buy Qualcomm in an effort to become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year. Analysts said Broadcom can now raise its bid, go for a proxy fight or launch a hostile exchange offer. “Qualcomm’s ‘thanks, but no thanks’ response to the unsolicited bid by Broadcom isn’t surprising and we would be surprised if at this point, Broadcom didn’t move forward with a proxy fight,” Loop Capital analyst Betsy Van Hees told Reuters. If Broadcom makes a hostile bid, Qualcomm’s governance rules would allow the rival to submit its own slate for the entire 11-member board by the Dec. 8 nomination deadline. The easiest option, however, would be to talk to Qualcomm’s board and agree on a higher price. “We are well-advised and know what our options are, and we have not eliminated any of those options,” Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan told Reuters last week.          The right price for Qualcomm could be between $80 and $85 per share, and Broadcom could go up to $90, Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland told Reuters. Any deal would face scrutiny from the antitrust regulators as the combined company would own the high-end WiFi business globally, analysts said. Regulators are already scrutinizing Qualcomm’s $38-billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV. Broadcom has indicated it is willing to buy Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal. Qualcomm now needs to convince investors that they can create more shareholder value independently, Raymond James analyst Chris Caso said.

888,QCOM,Qualcomm draws up plans to rebuff Broadcom's $103 billion offer: sources,"(Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) is making preparations to reject rival Broadcom Ltd’s (AVGO.O) $103 billion bid as early as this week, four people familiar with the matter said on Sunday, setting the stage for one of the biggest-ever takeover battles. Qualcomm’s board of directors could meet as early as Sunday to review the unsolicited acquisition offer and decide on its strategy, the sources said. The preparations for the board meeting indicate that Qualcomm is poised to rebuff the bid as insufficient as early as Monday, although it may decide to spend a few more days this week to prepare its full response to Broadcom, the sources added.  Qualcomm Chief Executive Steven Mollenkopf has spent the past few days soliciting feedback from Qualcomm shareholders, and feels that Broadcom’s $70-per-share bid undervalues the company and does not price in the uncertainty associated with getting the deal approved by regulators, according to the sources. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, who said earlier this month he would redomicile his company to the United States from Singapore, has stated he is open to launching a takeover battle. The sources said Broadcom was preparing to submit a slate of directors by Qualcomm’s Dec. 8 nomination deadline. That would allow Qualcomm shareholders to vote to replace the company’s board and force it to engage with Broadcom. Broadcom has also been deliberating the possibility of raising its bid for Qualcomm, including through more debt financing, some of the sources said, although it was not clear when Broadcom would choose to make such a move.  The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Qualcomm and Broadcom did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Qualcomm provides chips to carrier networks to deliver broadband and mobile data. It is engaged in a patent infringement dispute with Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and is also trying to close its $38 billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) after signing a deal in October 2016. Broadcom has indicated it is willing to acquire Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal. NXP shares have been trading above Qualcomm’s offer price, as many NXP shareholders, including hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, have been holding out for a better price. Qualcomm does not plan to significantly raise its price for NXP as a defensive strategy to make its acquisition by Broadcom more expensive, according to one of the sources.

SenseTime and Qualcomm had announced a strategic tie last month to collaborate on AI, which will see SenseTime’s proprietary algorithms deployed in smart devices. Qualcomm, in a statement, confirmed the investment in SenseTime. The two firms did not disclose the size of the investment.  Reuters reported earlier in November that SenseTime plans to raise about $500 million in a new funding round, in what would be the biggest ever such fundraising by an AI startup. The fundraising will value SenseTime at about $2 billion and has drawn interest from prospective investors, including Singapore state investor Temasek [TEM.UL], the report said. The startup is one of several AI facial recognition firms in Greater China that are rapidly raising capital from local and foreign investors amid a multibillion dollar global drive to develop advanced facial recognition technology.  It raised $410 million in July in a funding round led by its main backer, Chinese buyout firm CDH Investments, and China’s state-backed fund Sailing Capital. SenseTime is developing technology that employs AI to quickly identify and analyze identities using cameras, and has been used in limited tests by Chinese authorities to track and capture suspects in public spaces such as airports and festivals.  The startup, which is based between Beijing and Hong Kong, counts 40 local Chinese governments as clients. It is seeking to expand overseas, including possible plans for an ASEAN headquarters in Singapore. Qualcomm said earlier this month it signed $12 billion worth of deals with three Chinese mobile handset makers on the sidelines of a state visit to Beijing by U.S. President Donald Trump.

The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) “is expected to clear Qualcomm’s acquisition of NXP imminently,” the source said.      “The European Commission is expected to follow soon.”     The JFTC did not respond to emailed requests for comments sent during out of office hours. The EU competition enforcer, which has set a March 15 deadline to rule on the deal, declined to comment while Qualcomm was not available for comment. Qualcomm, which supplies chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple (AAPL.O), wants to become the leading supplier to the fast-growing automotive chips market via the NXP purchase, the biggest-ever in the semiconductor industry.      To address competition concerns, the company has agreed not to purchase NXP’s standard essential patents and not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP’s near field communication (NFC) patents except for defensive purposes.  It also offered an interoperability pledge which will allow rival products to function with NXP’s products.    NXP co-invented NFC chips which enable mobile phones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data.     Qualcomm will make incremental changes to concessions offered to the EU authority last month, the person said.  A similar proposal was also proposed to the JFTC.      Broadcom made its move last week in an effort to become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year. Qualcomm has dismissed the offer, saying it undervalues the company.      Broadcom, Qualcomm and NXP together would have control over modems, Wi-Fi, GPS and near-field communications chips, a strong position that could concern customers such as Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) because of the bargaining power such a combined company could have to raise prices.  However, a combined company would also likely have a lower cost base and the flexibility to cut prices.

902,QCOM,Broadcom eyes big changes for Qualcomm's patent practices,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As part of its $103 billion bid to buy Qualcomm Inc, Broadcom Ltd has hinted that it would make big changes to Qualcomm’s patent licensing business, a major cash-cow for the company but a source of bitter conflict with regulators and key customers including Apple Inc. But Broadcom has given few details about how it would go about revising Qualcomm’s practices. Qualcomm has so far rejected Broadcom’s takeover offer, saying the offer undervalued the company and would face regulatory hurdles.  Patent licenses accounted for some $5.1 billion in pre-tax profits for Qualcomm in its fiscal 2017, compared with $2.7 billion in pre-tax profits for its chip business that brings in two and a half times more revenue. Thus, Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan would need to carefully pair any changes to the program with cost cuts elsewhere, with Qualcomm’s annual $5.5 billion research and development budget seen as a prime target by analysts. If Broadcom is successful in buying Qualcomm, a source familiar with the matter said that Broadcom would try to maintain the economics of the licensing business by adjusting the pricing structure between the licensing and chip selling businesses. It would also attempt to renegotiate contracts with major customers, the source said.  Broadcom is eager to appease big customers like Apple, whose support is needed to overcome antitrust hurdles. While customers often look askance at consolidation among their suppliers, Broadcom has said it offers a possible solution to a conflict that has led to a regulatory crackdown, lawsuits with Apple and also has prompted others to cease paying licensing fees.  At the center of the conflict is Qualcomm’s practice of requiring mobile phone makers to pay a license fee on its intellectual property in addition to what they pay for its chips. Qualcomm invented a number of foundational technologies for mobile communications. In legal complaints, Apple has called Qualcomm’s approach “double dipping.” Qualcomm has repeatedly rejected the notion that its patent practices are anticompetitive and maintains that its chip business and patent business are run separately.  A Broadcom spokeswoman told Reuters in early November that it believes that regulators around the world will “welcome this deal as a solution to the double-dipping issue.” Tan said in an interview earlier this month that he believes Broadcom “can be very constructive in resolving these issues and resetting relationships. We would not have embarked on this offer if we were not confident that our common key customers would not embrace it.” Broadcom declined to comment further. Analysts said there are three possibilities for Broadcom to resolve Qualcomm’s licensing issues: sell or spin off the licensing unit, shift to a model that charges a flat fee, and simply charge more for chips, using the patents as leverage.  The simplest option for Broadcom would be to spin off Qualcomm’s licensing division to financial buyers or Qualcomm shareholders, but its valuation would be hard to gauge. Revenue from the unit has declined from $7.9 billion in 2015 to $6.4 billion in Qualcomm’s fiscal 2017, largely thanks to Apple’s and another customer’s suspension of payments.  If the licensing unit remains within Qualcomm, one possibility is that Qualcomm would ditch its unpopular practice of charging a percentage of the selling price of a phone in favor of a flat per-device fee, Cowen and Co analyst Karl Ackerman said in a research note.  The most likely course of action, according to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, is for Broadcom to end the practice of asking handset makers to pay licensing fees and instead to ask them to pay a little more for chips. At the same time, Broadcom would lock in long-term supply agreements, using Qualcomm’s patent portfolio as leverage, Rasgon said. But such a move could result in lower overall prices for customers like Apple. Rasgon estimates that Apple pays about $15 for Qualcomm’s chips and another $10 per device in licensing fees, for a total of about $25 per phone. Broadcom could simply charge between $18 and $20 for the chips. “It’s a completely different model of how to run Qualcomm,” Rasgon said. “(Broadcom’s CEO Tan) is essentially saying, ‘You guys are wrong - the licensing revenue is never coming back,’” he said. Apple declined to comment. But the company has shown that it is willing to settle its patent disputes for the right price, often with an upfront payment and then ongoing royalties. Earlier this year, Apple settled with Nokia Oyj, handing over a $2 billion upfront cash payment and undisclosed ongoing payments over several years.  Rasgon estimates that one way or another Qualcomm will lose about $2.5 billion per year in royalty revenues from Apple.

903,QCOM,Broadcom considering sweetened Qualcomm bid: sources,"(Reuters) - Chipmaker Broadcom Ltd is considering raising its offer to buy rival Qualcomm Inc by offering more of its own stock, following consultation with several of Qualcomm’s top shareholders, according to people familiar with the matter.  While the timing of the new offer is uncertain, Broadcom’s bid preparations indicate that it is planning to apply pressure on Qualcomm to engage in negotiations by offering more to its shareholders, in addition to threatening to replace its board of directors.  Broadcom’s Chief Executive Hock Tan has stated he is open to launching a takeover battle and sources have previously said the company is preparing to submit a slate of directors by Qualcomm’s Dec. 8 nomination deadline. Qualcomm shareholders that want the company to engage in deal talks with Broadcom will be able to vote for that slate at a March 6 shareholder meeting. Broadcom has offered to pay $103 billion for Qualcomm, made up of $60 per share in cash and $10 per share of its own stock. Raising the offer by adding more of its shares would avoid Broadcom having to raise more debt and further pressure its credit rating, the sources said. Qualcomm’s shareholders have indicated to Broadcom they expect at least $80 per share in order for Qualcomm to be sold, the sources said. Broadcom’s board has not yet decided on the level of any new offer, the sources added. Broadcom has made several requests for a meeting with Qualcomm since it unveiled its offer on Nov. 6, the sources said. However, Qualcomm has so far rejected these meeting requests, the sources added. Broadcom had not approached Qualcomm in the weeks prior to announcing its offer, according to the sources. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Qualcomm and Broadcom declined to comment. Qualcomm shares jumped after the news of the possible sweetened offer and were up more than 2 percent at $68.05 in late afternoon trading. Broadcom shares were down 0.3 percent at $275.82. Qualcomm invented a number of technologies underlying mobile communications and also sells chips used in cellphones and other devices. It is engaged in a patent infringement dispute with Apple Inc, and is also trying to close its $38 billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV after signing a deal in October 2016. Broadcom has indicated it is willing to acquire Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal. NXP shares have been trading above Qualcomm’s offer price, as many NXP shareholders, including hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, have been holding out for a better price. Qualcomm does not need to decide to raise its offer for NXP until that deal receives antitrust clearance from all the regulators reviewing the deal around the world.

The move by the European Commission is part of a broader push to set new rules for internet-connected devices for cars, home automation and energy devices and not just for computers and smartphones. The issue, in which trillions of dollars in sales are at stake, has pitted Qualcomm, Ericsson, Nokia (NOKIA.HE) and other patent owners against users such as Apple, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler (DAIGn.DE). World No. 1 smartphone chip designer Qualcomm and Ericsson, use a patent fee model which predominates in the tech industry with royalties based on how much value a technology adds to a product. Apple, Google (GOOGL.O) and others in Silicon Valley have criticized the model, saying fixed fees are fairer. The Commission’s latest draft no longer has the phrase “licensing for all”, the sources said, a victory for Qualcomm as it removes the obligation on patent holders to provide patent license to all companies asking for them. A key sentence in an earlier proposal has also been deleted, people said. The sentence said that right holders could not unilaterally set prices according to the way in which a patent is used. The Commission did not respond to a request for comment. The non-binding guidelines could provide a basis for future EU rules.

908,QCOM,Apple accuses Qualcomm of patent infringement in countersuit,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Wednesday filed a countersuit against Qualcomm Inc, alleging that Qualcomm’s Snapdragon mobile phone chips that power a wide variety of Android-based devices infringe on Apple’s patents, the latest development in a long-running dispute. Qualcomm in July accused Apple of infringing several patents related to helping mobile phones get better battery life. Apple has denied the claims that it violated Qualcomm’s battery life patents and alleged that Qualcomm’s patents were invalid, a common move in such cases.  But on Wednesday, in a filing in U.S. District Court in San Diego, Apple revised its answer to Qualcomm’s complaint with accusations of its own. Apple alleges it owns at least eight battery life patents that Qualcomm has violated.  The Apple patents involve ensuring each part of a phone’s processor draws only the minimum power needed, turning off parts of the processor when they are not needed and making sleep and wake functions work better. In its filing, Apple alleges that Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 800 and 820 processors, which power phones from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Alphabet Inc’s Google’s Pixel phones, infringe on those patents. Samsung and Google are not named in Apple’s counterclaims. “Apple began seeking those patents years before Qualcomm began seeking the patents it asserts against Apple in this case,” the company wrote in its complaint. Apple said it is seeking unspecified damages from San Diego-based Qualcomm. Qualcomm filed its patent infringement lawsuit at the same time it filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission seeking to ban the import of Apple iPhones that use competing Intel Corp chips because of the alleged patent violations. The dispute between Apple and Qualcomm over patents is part of a wide-ranging legal war between the two companies. In January, Apple sued Qualcomm for nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebates that Qualcomm allegedly withheld from Apple. In a related suit, Qualcomm sued the contract manufacturers that make Apple’s phones, but Apple joined in to defend them.  Separately, Qualcomm is facing a lawsuit from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over many of the same pricing practices Apple names in its complaints.

918,QCOM,Broadcom set to unveil challenge to Qualcomm's board: sources,"(Reuters) - Chipmaker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) will take its first formal step on Monday toward a hostile bid to take over Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), unveiling nominees whom Qualcomm shareholders can vote on to replace the U.S. semiconductor company’s board of directors, according to people familiar with the matter. Broadcom’s move comes after Qualcomm rejected its $103 billion cash-and-stock bid last month. Qualcomm shareholders who want the company to engage in sale talks will be able to vote on Broadcom’s board director slate on March 6. Broadcom has lined up nine men and two women as board director nominees, many of whom have considerable experience in the technology sector, the sources said on Sunday. Private equity firm Silver Lake, an investor in Broadcom, has helped with the effort to recruit the nominees, the sources added. Broadcom will not be unveiling any new offer for Qualcomm on Monday, the sources said. It has been considering an improved bid, and will likely present it by March based on the reception its board director slate receives from Qualcomm shareholders, the sources added. Reuters reported last month that Broadcom was considering raising its offer by offering more of its own stock. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Broadcom and Qualcomm declined to comment. The board director slate that Broadcom puts forward will be heavily scrutinized, because its nominees will not just be asked to put Qualcomm up for sale, but will have to oversee the company until a deal with Broadcom closes.  Broadcom has said regulators may take a year to approve an acquisition of Qualcomm, while Qualcomm has countered that the regulatory review process globally could last much longer and is fraught with risks. Qualcomm is also engaged in a patent infringement dispute with Apple Inc (AAPL.O). Unless that legal spat is resolved in the next few months, Broadcom’s board director nominees will have to oversee the resolution of that issue as well.  Qualcomm is also trying to close its $38 billion acquisition of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) after signing a deal in October 2016. Broadcom has indicated it is willing to acquire Qualcomm irrespective of whether it closes the NXP deal. NXP shares have been trading above Qualcomm’s $110-per-share offer price, as many NXP shareholders, including hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, have been holding out for a better price. The spread has tightened, however, in the past month. NXP shares ended trading on Friday at $114.78.

921,QCOM,"Qualcomm adds security, battery life features to phone chips","(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc on Wednesday revealed new security and battery life features on its latest Snapdragon 845 mobile phone processor, a chip that customarily powers high-end Android-based phones from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and others. The chips are increasingly important to Qualcomm’s financial picture while its patent licensing business is under attack from Apple Inc. Qualcomm’s latest chip features a range of improvements to help it deal with artificial intelligence tasks like recognizing and categorizing images, Keith Kressin, a senior vice president at the company, told Reuters in an interview. For the first time, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chip also features physically separate processor called a “Secure Processing Unit” for storing information like fingerprints and iris scans, similar to technology found on Apple’s iPhone. Previous Qualcomm chips had a “trusted zone” that was not physically separate from the rest of the processor. “With biometric identification on the rise, it was important to take (security) to the next level,” Kressin said. The company tweaked various parts of the chip for so-called machine learning applications. While that includes things consumers might notice like image recognition, it also includes behind-the-scenes improvements. For example, the chip will help ensure that a user’s fingers do not accidentally register as taps when gripping the sides of an edge-to-edge display. Kressin said the chip will also help phones register touch screen inputs when wet. That is a critical improvement because even though many top phone models from Samsung and others are now water resistant, they are difficult to operate with water on the screen. The newest Snapdragon also has features aimed at virtual and augmented reality headsets. One feature called “Adreno foveation” will let the edges of a headset screen operate at lower resolutions while the center of the screen is sharper, similar to how human peripheral vision is fuzzier than central vision. The technique can save battery live, Kressin said. Qualcomm does not disclose revenue figures for its Snapdragon chips. But they are an increasingly important part of its business because its lucrative patent licensing business is under attack in a series of legal actions from Apple. Qualcomm is also facing a $103 billion takeover bid from Broadcom Ltd, which earlier this week said it would nominate a slate of directors to Qualcomm’s board.

TSMC in September said it would build a semiconductor fabrication plant (fab) in Taiwan dedicated to 3 nanometre (nm) technology. It did not say when the project will begin or end. “This fab could cost upwards of $20 billion and represents TSMC’s commitment to drive technology forward,” Co-Chief Executive Mark Liu, who will succeed Morris Chang as chairman next year, said at the firm’s supply chain management forum. Liu also identified growth areas as artificial intelligence and fifth-generation mobile communication networks (5G), the chips for which TSMC is already offering. “Current 5G development progress points to 2019 as the year of volume deployment,” Liu said. Liu said development of 5 nm technology is on schedule and that TSMC expected “risk” production in the first half of 2019 at a fab for which construction will begin early next year. Separately, wafer output at TSMC’s first factory in China, which is under construction, will begin in May.

931,QCOM,Broadcom profit beats as Qualcomm takeover fight intensifies,"(Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and boosted its dividend by 72 percent, days after the chipmaker took its $103 billion bid for Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) hostile. Shares of Broadcom rose 5 percent in extended trading after the company also forecast first-quarter revenue largely above analysts’ estimates. The company said on Monday it planned to field a slate of 11 nominees to Qualcomm’s board, its first formal move towards a hostile bid for the U.S. chipmaker. Broadcom’s move came after Qualcomm rejected its $70 per share bid, saying the offer undervalued the company and would face regulatory hurdles. However, Broadcom’s chief financial officer, Thomas Krause, appeared confident of overcoming regulatory hurdles. “After having had initial meetings with certain relevant antitrust authorities, we remain confident that any regulatory requirement necessary to complete the combination will be met in a timely manner,” Krause said in a post-earnings call.   A combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world this year. Broadcom’s wireless business has been a strong performer as soaring sales of Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhone and Android smartphones drive demand for its WiFi and Bluetooth chips. The business far outperformed its wired infrastructure unit, which makes chips for set-top boxes and cable modems, with a 33.4 percent rise in sales and accounted for much of its fourth-quarter profit. Excluding items, the company earned $4.59 per share in the quarter ended Oct. 29, easily beating analysts’ expectations of $4.52 per share.  Net revenue rose to $4.84 billion, slightly above the $4.83 billion analysts had estimated. The company also forecast current-quarter revenue of $5.30 billion, plus or minus $75 million, helped by its acquisition of network gear maker Brocade Communications Systems. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $4.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Broadcom also raised its quarterly dividend to $1.75 per share from $1.02.

932,QCOM,Elliott says chipmaker NXP worth 23 percent more than Qualcomm's offer,"(Reuters) - Activist investor Elliott Management Corp said on Monday NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) is worth about 23 percent more than Qualcomm Inc’s (QCOM.O) $38-billion offer to buy the chipmaker. Elliott, which has a stake of about 6 percent in NXP, said NXP was worth $135 per share on an intrinsic standalone basis, compared with Qualcomm’s offer of $110 made in October 2016. NXP shares were up 0.6 percent at $116 in morning trading, while Qualcomm’s shares were up about 1 percent at $64.87. Elliott, a New York-based hedge fund, said Qualcomm’s offer had taken advantage of NXP’s depressed stock price last year and has acted as a ceiling on its valuation. “We believe NXP’s prospects are bright. Approximately half of NXP’s revenue is exposed to exciting growth engines of the semiconductor market – automotive and industrial,” Elliott said in a letter to other NXP shareholders. Qualcomm replied saying it believed the agreed-upon price of $110 is full and fair, and that it remained fully committed to closing the acquisition.  “Elliott’s value assertion for NXP is unsupportable and is clearly nothing more than an attempt to advance its own self-serving agenda,” Qualcomm said in a statement. Elliott said it has retained UBS to conduct a financial analysis on NXP and that it would share the report with other shareholders. NXP’s shares have been trading above Qualcomm’s offer price since Aug. 4 when Elliott indicated it was pushing for a higher price. Besides trying to convince NXP investors of the planned acquisition, Qualcomm has also toiled to win regulatory approval and has offered certain concessions to address concerns the deal would hamper competition in the market. Since it offered to buy NXP, Qualcomm itself has been the target of an acquisition approach from Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O), but it rejected the $103-billion offer last month. Broadcom had indicated it was willing to acquire Qualcomm, for $70 per share, irrespective of whether it closed the NXP deal.

Broadcom had indicated it was willing to acquire Qualcomm, for $70 per share, irrespective of whether it closed the NXP deal. Acquiring NXP would make Qualcomm the leading chip supplier to the fast-growing automotive market.

939,QCOM,U.S. syndicated lending topples records in 2017,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A late-year burst of mergers and an unrelenting push by companies to cut borrowing costs propelled US syndicated loan issuance to a record high this year, with pending corporate tax rate cuts seen motivating fast-paced lending at least into early 2018.  A corporate tax rate cut to 21% from 35% under a new US tax system, as well as the potential to relax or repeal US leveraged lending guidelines, likely will keep stoking corporate acquisitions and leveraged buyouts, bankers and attorneys said. US syndicated lending reached an all-time high of US$2.41trn as of December 19, jumping 24% above US$1.94trn in the same period last year and 13% above the previous full-year record of US$2.14trn set in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters LPC. “At the moment, the markets are open and can absorb very large financings,” said Robert Kilcullen, managing director, corporate advisory at MUFG.  “Outside of a few sectors,  I don’t think there’s anything that’s going to give a buyer pause to think that the bank lending market is not going to be there,” he said. Leveraged lending to highly indebted companies leaped 62% to about a record US$1.33trn from US$821.4bn in the same period last year. The prior high was US$1.13trn for full-year 2013.  Repricing and refinancing represented two-thirds of the volume as borrowers locked in more favorable terms before interest rates increase further. Most deals met with ardent investor demand. The year began with extremely sluggish lending for new deals, as the markets endured several failed attempts by the Trump administration to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, two large health insurance mergers being scrapped in April due to antitrust rulings and hesitation to push ahead with acquisitions if tax relief was on its way. The pace picked up as the year progressed, when it became clear that tax reform was a longer-term prospect. Companies looking to expand in a slow-growing economy did so by buying corporations with complementary businesses. In recent weeks, the tax debate heated up as did M&A; activity. Congress is voting Tuesday on the biggest overhaul of the US tax system in more than 30 years, paving the way for President Donald Trump to sign the bill into law as early as Wednesday. Lending to high-grade companies slipped 7% this year to US$802.8bn from US$864.8bn for the same period last year, but has sharply increased in recent months. As corporate tax rates are sliced and companies can more cheaply access cash stockpiles held overseas, mergers could keep ramping up, bankers and attorneys said. Borrowing costs remain advantageous and investor appetite remains ardent, should companies seek new financing to back acquisitions. Leveraged financings this year included office supplies retailer Staples Inc’s US$2.9bn term loan backing Sycamore Partners’ buyout of the Staples delivery business, and a US$1.85bn credit facility backing US internet security company DigiCert’s purchase of Symantec’s web certification business. Prominent investment-grade loans included the US$13.7bn bridge loan for Amazon.com’s purchase of upscale grocer Whole Foods Markets, shaking up the food supply chain business and promising more tie-ups altering delivery models in arenas including pharmaceuticals. “Every smart Wall Street firm is thinking about the merger of technology and retail, so that’s a big topic around consolidation,” a senior banker said. And in the final month of the year, US$49bn of loans funded the cash portion of US drugstore operator CVS Health Corp’s purchase of health insurer Aetna Inc. The CVS loans, the second-largest new acquisition loan financing on record, could be dwarfed if Broadcom Ltd’s hostile bid to buy US chipmaker Qualcomm for US$103bn is successful. “Outside of a few pockets, including retail, fundamentals have been very strong throughout the year and were getting stronger over the course of the year,” said Adam Brown, senior portfolio manager and co-head of high yield at Macquarie Investment Management, Americas. “We’ve been hearing management teams talk with a lot of confidence about their business and forward looking outlook,” he said. Whether 2018 repeats this year’s record total lending depends in large part on tax policy ripple effects. “If companies are more easily able to access cash trapped overseas, investment grade companies will have a reduced appetite for issuing debt in the US when they can simply utilize the cash that’s overseas,” said Steven Oh, global head of credit and fixed income at PineBridge Investments. On the leveraged side, limits on interest deductibility could increase costs for highly indebted companies, increasing their chance of defaulting in an economic downturn, Moody’s Investors Service said last week. Still, most businesses expect gains from capital spending deductibility and newly lowered tax rates could offset the interest deduction hit, bankers said.

947,QCOM,CEOs go M&A; hunting as booming markets unleash dealmaking spirits,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions had another strong year in 2017, reaching their third highest annual level since the 2008 financial crisis, as CEOs were emboldened by buoyant markets to pursue transformative deals, even when their targets resisted. Companies negotiated large deals this year even before they had certainty that U.S. tax reforms advocated by President Donald Trump’s Republican party would become law, as economic growth around the world, including in Europe, accelerated. Setting 2017 apart was the willingness of potential acquirers to approach their targets unsolicited. In some instances, as with chipmaker Broadcom Ltd’s $103 billion cash-and-stock bid to take over peer Qualcomm Inc, the target companies refused to engage in talks. “In cases where companies have been sold, close to 80 percent of them were initiated by the buyer approaching the seller as opposed to companies who decided to sell,” said Michael Carr, global co-head of mergers & acquisitions at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “Some of this is driven by buyers who believe they will not face competition, which encourages them to aggressively pressure their targets confidentially with the implied threat that they will go public,” Carr added. Unsolicited takeover approaches helped push global M&A; to $3.54 trillion in 2017, roughly in line with last year’s $3.59 trillion, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data. The peak M&A; year since 2008 was 2015, when M&A; totaled $4.22 trillion. The dealmaking environment has been favorable in the last three years due to the availability of cheap debt financing and high CEO confidence. Geopolitical turmoil, including a potential confrontation over North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and faltering negotiations to form a coalition government in Germany, failed to dampen M&A; spirits. “Geopolitical uncertainty has had relatively little impact on our deals pipeline this year,” said Cyrus Kapadia, vice chairman of investment banking at Lazard Ltd. “Boards are supportive of deal-making where there is clear strategic rationale, and even in Britain, where Brexit is causing some uncertainty, companies are still pursuing large-scale deals to enhance organic growth,” he added. EUROPE, ASIA-PACIFIC M&A; UP A 16 percent year-on-year drop in M&A; in the United States to $1.4 trillion was offset on a global basis by a 16 percent rise in M&A; in Europe to $856 billion and an 11 percent rise in Asia-Pacific M&A; to $912 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Among this year’s biggest acquisitions were U.S. drugstore chain operator CVS Health Corp’s $69 billion agreement to buy health insurer Aetna Inc; Walt Disney Co’s $52 billion deal to buy film and television businesses from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc; and aerospace supplier United Technologies Corp’s $30 billion agreement to buy avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc. Many of these deals had stock as part of the purchase price, with acquirers emboldened to use their own shares as currency given their high stock market valuations, as opposed to offering just cash. “We are seeing a stock component becoming a bigger portion of the offers being made, perhaps because the deals are bigger and transformative, and acquirers are looking to offer targets additional upside in these transactions,” said Stephen Arcano, an M&A; partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.  Private equity-backed M&A; activity totaled $322.6 billion globally in 2017, a 27 percent increase compared to last year, as more buyout firms sought to put money they have raised from their investors to work. Dealmakers say the prospect of the U.S. tax overhaul has so far had little influence on deal negotiations. “If you are an acquirer, you are likely modeling a deal  where the synergies and the incremental value of combining is what is driving your purchase price and your premium, not an assumption on the underlying tax rate,” said Chris Ventresca, global M&A; co-head at ‎JPMorgan Chase & Co. “If you are considering selling the entire company, as long as the buyer is willing to pay your price, you take the certainty of crystallizing a premium now with some ability to participate in tax reform upside via buyer stock,” Ventresca added. Companies may decide to allocate more of their cash to M&A; in 2018 following the implementation of the U.S. tax changes, however. “U.S. companies with lots of cash trapped overseas can now more easily put capital to work in the M&A; market, while Europeans may try to take advantage of favorable tax policies to do more deals in the United States,” said Dietrich Becker, co-head of European advisory at Perella Weinberg Partners LP.

950,QCOM,UPDATE 2-BlackBerry surges on deal with Baidu for self-driving cars,"(Reuters) - BlackBerry Ltd (BB.TO) and Chinese internet search firm Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) on Wednesday signed a deal to jointly develop self-driving vehicle technology, sending BlackBerry’s Toronto-listed shares up 13 percent to a four-year high. The deal follows similar agreements with firms including Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), Denso (6902.T) and Aptiv Plc (APTV.N) to develop autonomous-driving technology with BlackBerry’s QNX software, which are expected to start generating revenue in 2019.  Investors and analysts are closely watching what comes of those agreements amid expectations that QNX could become a key technology in the burgeoning self-driving vehicle industry, serving as the operating system for computer chips used to run self-driving vehicles. QNX will be the operating system for Apollo, a platform for self-driving vehicles that Baidu announced in April and has billed as the “Android” of the autonomous driving industry.  “The opportunity is global, it’s for a very large market and I think it’s a very solid win for BlackBerry,” said CIBC Capital Markets analyst Todd Coupland. Apollo has since signed up several major automakers, including Ford Motor Co (F.N), Hyundai Motor Group (005380.KS) and several Chinese carmakers. QNX has long been used to run car infotainment consoles. BlackBerry has recently developed the software to run sophisticated computer chips for autos that manage multiple safety-critical systems. BlackBerry shares rose 13 percent in Toronto to C$16.95, their sharpest one-day gain since April and highest close since March 2013. The two companies said they will also integrate Baidu’s CarLife, a leading smartphone integration software for connected cars in China, its conversational AI system and high definition maps with BlackBerry’s infotainment platform.

956,QCOM,BlackBerry launches cybersecurity software for self-driving cars,"(Reuters) - Canadian software maker BlackBerry Ltd on Monday launched a new cybersecurity software, which identifies vulnerabilities in programs used in self-driving cars. The product, called Blackberry Jarvis, is being marketed first to automakers - a group of customers the former smartphone maker is hoping will power its turnaround efforts - but could also have applications in healthcare and industrial automation. BlackBerry said it was offering Jarvis on a pay-as-you-go basis. Once initiated, automakers will have online access to Jarvis and can scan files at every stage of software development, the company said. Last year, the global “ransomware” attack, dubbed WannaCry, helped raise awareness of BlackBerry’s security software business, which is largely focused on managing secure connections to mobile devices.     BlackBerry said it had already tested Jarvis with automaker Tata Motors’ Jaguar Land Rover unit, whose chief executive said Jarvis reduced the time needed to assess code from 30 days to seven minutes.  BlackBerry in September announced it would partner with auto supplier Delphi Automotive Plc on a software operating system for self-driving cars. Earlier this month BlackBerry and Chinese internet search firm Baidu Inc signed a deal to jointly develop self-driving vehicle technology. BlackBerry has also recently signed automotive-related deals with chipmaker Qualcomm, auto supplier Denso and Ford Motor Co.

957,QCOM,"Qualcomm raises profit forecast, may buy back stock if bid for NXP fails","(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), the U.S. chipmaker fending off a hostile bid by Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O), raised its profit forecast on Tuesday and said it might use funds to buy back stock if its $38 billion bid to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) fails. It was the first time Qualcomm raised the buyback as an alternative to buying NXP, as the deal faces strong opposition from NXP shareholders. “With tax reform, we are well positioned to complete a large stock buyback that will deliver essentially the same level of accretion to Qualcomm stockholders as if we had closed NXP,” Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer George Davis said in a webcast. “Our preference is to close NXP, but not at all costs.” Under legislation approved by U.S. lawmakers in December, U.S. companies may repatriate overseas cash at a 15.5 percent tax rate compared to the standard 35 percent rate. This has prompted companies such as Qualcomm to think about tapping overseas cash in new ways. Qualcomm shares closed 4.38 percent higher to $68.25. Broadcom’s offer, unveiled on Nov. 6, valued Qualcomm at $70 per share. NXP closed at $119.40, above the $110 Qualcomm bid. Bank of Montreal analyst Tim Long said in a research note that he was encouraged by Qualcomm’s “more aggressive stance,” but believed that 5G technology would take longer than expected to materalize, making the company’s 2019 targets more difficult to achieve. Qualcomm is trying to show investors that Broadcom’s $103 billion cash-and-stock offer significantly undervalues the company.  Qualcomm forecast adjusted per share profit of $6.75 to $7.50 in 2019, on revenue of $35 billion to $37 billion. Analysts on average expected a profit of $3.79 per share on revenue of $23.59 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company plans to achieve its new profit target through a new $1 billion cost reduction plan and by resolving current licensing disputes, including with Apple Inc (AAPL.O). The $1 billion cost plan contrasts with Broadcom’s proposed $3 billion in annual cost cuts at Qualcomm.

958,QCOM,"UPDATE 3-Qualcomm raises profit forecast, may buy back stock if bid for NXP fails","(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), the U.S. chipmaker fending off a hostile bid by Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O), raised its profit forecast on Tuesday and said it might use funds to buy back stock if its $38 billion bid to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) fails. It was the first time Qualcomm raised the buyback as an alternative to buying NXP, as the deal faces strong opposition from NXP shareholders. “With tax reform, we are well positioned to complete a large stock buyback that will deliver essentially the same level of accretion to Qualcomm stockholders as if we had closed NXP,” Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer George Davis said in a webcast. “Our preference is to close NXP, but not at all costs.” Under legislation approved by U.S. lawmakers in December, U.S. companies may repatriate overseas cash at a 15.5 percent tax rate compared to the standard 35 percent rate. This has prompted companies such as Qualcomm to think about tapping overseas cash in new ways. Qualcomm shares closed 4.38 percent higher to $68.25. Broadcom’s offer, unveiled on Nov. 6, valued Qualcomm at $70 per share. NXP closed at $119.40, above the $110 Qualcomm bid. Bank of Montreal analyst Tim Long said in a research note that he was encouraged by Qualcomm’s “more aggressive stance,” but believed that 5G technology would take longer than expected to materalize, making the company’s 2019 targets more difficult to achieve. Qualcomm is trying to show investors that Broadcom’s $103 billion cash-and-stock offer significantly undervalues the company.  Qualcomm forecast adjusted per share profit of $6.75 to $7.50 in 2019, on revenue of $35 billion to $37 billion. Analysts on average expected a profit of $3.79 per share on revenue of $23.59 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company plans to achieve its new profit target through a new $1 billion cost reduction plan and by resolving current licensing disputes, including with Apple Inc (AAPL.O). The $1 billion cost plan contrasts with Broadcom’s proposed $3 billion in annual cost cuts at Qualcomm.

965,QCOM,UPDATE 3-FTC investigating Broadcom for antitrust practices,"(Reuters) - The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating whether chipmaker Broadcom Ltd engaged in anticompetitive tactics in negotiations with customers, the company said on Wednesday. The investigation comes as Broadcom pursues a hostile takeover of Qualcomm  in a $103 billion deal. Since the FTC would likely review any merger for anticompetitive practices, the current probe could make regulatory approval more challenging.  Broadcom was recently issued subpoenas that seek an extensive amount of information, according to the Wall Street Journal, which was the first to report the probe on Wednesday. The focus of the concern has been that Broadcom has changed some contracts to require customers to buy a percentage of its production of items rather than a certain number, the paper reported. “This FTC review is immaterial to our business, does not relate to wireless and has no impact on our proposal to acquire Qualcomm,” Broadcom said in a statement. Broadcom shares were up slightly on Wednesday afternoon, trading at $265.81. The FTC, which investigates actions that might break antitrust law, declined to comment. Chipmaker Qualcomm is fending off a takeover bid by Broadcom. In November, it rejected Broadcom’s $103 billion cash-and-stock bid, saying it dramatically undervalued the company. In December, Qualcomm rejected Broadcom’s 11 director nominees. U.S. antitrust regulators will likely take a close look at any deal since a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm would become the dominant supplier of chips used in the 1.5 billion or so smartphones expected to be sold around the world. It would raise the stakes for Intel Corp , which has been diversifying from its stronghold in computers into smartphone technology by supplying modem chips to Apple Inc .

Qualcomm said the European Union clearance, along with approval earlier on Thursday from the Korea Fair Trade Commission, meant it now had eight of nine approvals, with just China remaining. It said it was optimistic that would come soon. Qualcomm, which supplies chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple (AAPL.O), is set to become the leading supplier to the fast-growing automotive chip market following the deal, the largest-ever in the semiconductor industry The European Commission, which oversees competition policy in the 28-nation EU, said in a statement on Thursday it had identified a number of competition concerns that had led to an in-depth investigation, but was now satisfied with the deal. “We use our smartphones for many different things and now also more and more as mobile wallets, to pay for public transport or make other secure payments,” said European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager “With this decision, we ensure that Qualcomm’s takeover of NXP will not prevent consumers from continuing to enjoy the benefits of these innovative technologies at competitive prices.” The EU’s concerns had included the interoperability of the merged group’s chips with rivals’ products and significant intellectual property related to NFC (near-field communication) technology.

971,QCOM,UPDATE 2-TSMC forecasts record 2018 revenue on cryptocurrency boom,"* TSMC expects 2018 revenue to climb 10-15 percent * Q4 net profit edges down 0.9 percent, just below record level * Q4 revenue up 5.9 percent from a year ago (Recasts, adds comment from earnings call) By Jess Macy Yu TAIPEI, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) expects a boom in the cryptocurrency market to drive up demand for high-end chips and help it post a record revenue this year, outweighing softening sales to smartphone vendors. TSMC’s outlook highlights a trend of chip makers benefiting from new technology, such as blockchain, cloud computing, self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, that require powerful processing power and low energy-consumption. Cryptocurrency is the latest entry on this list of revenue drivers. “The urge to mine cryptocurrency is very strong, and the incentive of course depends on the price of cryptocurrency,” TSMC Chairman Morris Chang said at an earnings conference on Thursday, after the company earlier reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. “Demand right now or for the last year has been very strong, and we expect it to continue to be strong ... I believe that we will both satisfy our customers and we will not be too optimistic,” Chang added. TSMC expects revenue to grow between 10-15 percent this year, versus a modest 3.1-percent growth in 2017, after factoring in flat demand from mobile customers. TSMC, which is a key supplier for Apple, Qualcomm Inc and Nvidia Corp, posted a net profit of T$99.29 billion ($3.36 billion) for the quarter ended December, just 0.9 percent less than a year ago. But this was slightly ahead of an average forecast of T$97.78 billion drawn from 20 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose to $9.2 billion, in line with the company’s guidance and up 5.9 percent from a year ago. Apart from cryptocurrency-related demand, results were also aided by a major smartphone release, TSMC’s co-CEO, C.C. Wei, said. Analysts said he was referring to Apple’s delayed launch of iPhone X in early November. Revenue at TSMC’s computer segment surged 25 percent in the quarter, while its communications business, which generates nearly 60 percent of the company’s total sales, logged a 2 percent decline. High performance computing will register the strongest growth this year, thanks to demand for graphics chips and high-performance chips used to mine cryptocurrencies, said co-CEO Mark Liu who is set to take over from retiring Chang in June as chairman. Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that use encryption techniques for security and can be traded. Mining consumes large quantities of energy and needs chips with a lot of processing power to solve complex math puzzles to validate transactions. Cryptocurrencies saw a dramatic run-up in 2017 as an explosion in so-called initial coin offerings - digital, token-based fundraising rounds - drove demand. But there has been a reversal of fortunes this year amid concerns global coordination on how to regulate the sector will accelerate. TSMC’s market value increased by 38 percent over the past year to $212 billion, partly due to the cryptocurrency wave. Prior to the earnings announcement on Thursday, shares in TSMC closed up 2.7 percent, versus a 0.6 percent rise in the wider market. For the current quarter, usually a slower period for the tech sector, TSMC sees revenue at $8.4 billion to $8.5 billion.

The FTC review is part of a process under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act to scrutinize potentially anti-competitive mergers. The vast majority of deals reviewed by the FTC and the Department of Justice are allowed to proceed after the first preliminary review, according to the FTC’s website. However, if a second request is issued, companies must provide more information to the FTC. As part of its defense against Broadcom, Qualcomm has argued that any deal faces a long antitrust review. Broadcom said that it had anticipated the second request as a normal part of the regulatory approval process.  “This signifies that Broadcom is moving into the next stage of the U.S. antitrust review process,” Broadcom said in a statement.  Deals that get a second FTC request for information often do so because of their complexity and size, and a potential acquisition of Qualcomm by Broadcom could still subsequently be approved, according to sources who asked not to be named because the matter is private. Reuters reported on the second request earlier on Friday. Qualcomm declined to comment, while the FTC did not respond to a request for comment. Broadcom said this week that a separate FTC review of its client relationships is immaterial to its operations, does not relate to its wireless business and has no impact on its proposal to acquire Qualcomm. Broadcom has said it is very confident it can complete the Qualcomm deal within 12 months of signing an agreement, while Qualcomm has said that the regulatory review processes required around the world would take much longer.  A deal that Qualcomm has in the works, its proposed $38 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, was approved by EU antitrust regulators this week. Only China has yet to approve this deal, something expected in the next two weeks, according to one of the sources. The NXP deal still faces an uncertain future because some NXP shareholders have asked for Qualcomm to raise its offer. Broadcom has offered to pay $60 per share in cash and $10 per share of its own stock for Qualcomm. To put pressure on Qualcomm, Broadcom has put forward 11 board director nominees to replace Qualcomm’s board. Qualcomm shareholders are scheduled to vote on these directors in March.

The NXP deal still faces an uncertain future because some NXP shareholders have asked for Qualcomm to raise its offer. Broadcom has offered to pay $60 per share in cash and $10 per share of its own stock for Qualcomm. To put pressure on Qualcomm, Broadcom has put forward 11 board director nominees to replace Qualcomm’s board. Qualcomm shareholders are scheduled to vote on these directors in March.

983,QCOM,EU fines chipmaker Qualcomm $1.2 billion over exclusivity deal with Apple,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc was hit with a 997 million euro ($1.23 billion) fine by European Union antitrust regulators on Wednesday for paying Apple Inc to use only its chips, blocking out rivals such as Intel Corp . The EU decision is the latest in a series by global regulators that have amounted to billions of dollars in fines and require changes in Qualcomm business. The contract at issue with Apple is no longer in force, and Qualcomm already faces more competition from Intel and other rivals. Still, the EU decision could make Qualcomm more vulnerable to chipmaker Broadcom Ltd’s $103 billion hostile bid, since Broadcom argues it can smooth rocky relations with customers such as Apple.. Qualcomm said it would appeal the decision immediately. The European Commission said its investigation, launched in 2015, covered the period from 2011 to 2016 and took into account Qualcomm’s market dominance in LTE baseband chipsets, which enable rapid mobile broadband connections. “Qualcomm paid billions of U.S. dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rivals. These payments were not just reductions in price – they were made on the condition that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm’s baseband chipsets in all its iPhones and iPads,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. “This meant that no rival could effectively challenge Qualcomm in this market, no matter how good their products were,” she said. The fine represented 4.9 percent of Qualcomm’s 2017 turnover, the Commission said. Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement that the company believed its agreement with Apple did not violate EU rules. “We have a strong case for judicial review and we will immediately commence that process,” he said.  Qualcomm’s shares were down 1.35 percent at $67.42 in midday trade, and analysts saw the fine as good for Broadcom’s approach. “While Qualcomm believes they are in a temporary (albeit perfect) storm of customer and regulatory issues, Broadcom believes that the current problems are a harbinger of further headwinds to come,” Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein, said in a note to clients Wednesday. “And this latest finding continues to support the idea that regulators remain unhappy with the current state of affairs.” Despite levying fines, EU antitrust regulators recently cleared Qualcomm’s $38 billion bid to buy NXP Semiconductors. Chinese regulators still need to approve the deal, and some NXP shareholders want a higher price. Qualcomm is required to post a bond for the fine while the appeal unfolds, which will likely result in a charge for the current quarter. When hit with fines in the past, such as $774 million levy last year from Taiwanese regulators, Qualcomm took a charge as it appealed. Vestager told a news conference there would be no repercussions for Apple in the case. EU antitrust regulators have come under pressure after European judges sent a case against U.S. chipmaker Intel back to an EU court for an appeal. Intel was fined 1 billion euros in 2009 for paying computer makers to buy most of their chips from them. Google has also appealed against a record 2.4 billion euro fine for giving prominent placements in searches to its shopping service and demoting rival offerings. This is the Commission’s first decision on market abuse since the Intel ruling last September. Vestager said the ruling had given guidance on how to prove its case. “We have carefully examined the ruling and the evidence in our case to make sure that our decision fully complies with the guidance given by the court,” she said. Apple and Qualcomm are meanwhile locked in a wide-ranging legal battle over Qualcomm’s business practices, which started a year ago with Apple suing Qualcomm for nearly $1 billion in patent royalty rebates that the chipmaker allegedly withheld from the phone maker. Other regulators, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, are also investigating Qualcomm’s dealings with Apple. The EU competition enforcer is expected to rule in the coming months against Qualcomm in another case involving British phone software maker Icera, which was later acquired by Nvidia Corp, a person familiar with the matter has told Reuters. In that case, Qualcomm is accused of selling chipsets below cost to drive out Icera - a practice known as predatory pricing.

Qualcomm alleged that Apple demanded the discount as an “incentive” to do business with Qualcomm. In a separate lawsuit filed in January 2017 by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission against Qualcomm, regulators alleged that Qualcomm’s agreement was a “de facto” exclusivity arrangement that violated antitrust rules. The FTC said the chipmaker could cut off Apple’s incentive payments and even require a refund of past payments if Apple tapped a different supplier. Qualcomm has denied the FTC’s allegations.

The first payment is part of 60 installments that Qualcomm will have to fork out for the fine totaling T$23.4 billion the commission slapped on the chipmaker for the violations, the regulator told a news conference. As part of the agreement, the chipmaker will make monthly payments over the next five years to pay off the fine, the commission said. Earlier, the commission said Qualcomm had a monopoly over the chip market for several so-called modem technologies, which provide wireless data connectivity for mobile phones, and refused to license its technology to other industry players. Qualcomm’s fine is the latest in a years-long streak of regulatory setbacks to its business model that comes as it also fights U.S. regulators and iPhone maker Apple Inc in court over many of the same legal issues.  In December 2016, South Korean regulators fined Qualcomm $854 million for violating its competition laws, a ruling that followed a $975 million fine from Chinese regulators in 2015.

Qualcomm, the world’s biggest supplier of mobile phone chips, said it has amended its patent licensing Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, the world’s No. 1 mobile handset maker. The news came just before Qualcomm released its fiscal first-quarter earnings, which were weighed down by its wide-ranging legal dispute with Apple and a weak sales outlook for smart phones sales in China. As part of the patent agreement, Qualcomm said Samsung would also withdraw its interventions in Qualcomm’s appeal of a Korean Fair Trade decision in the Seoul High Court. Separately, Samsung and Qualcomm said they extended their strategic relationship and would expand efforts to collaborate around 5G, the next generation of mobile data networks. The deal to end hostilities stands out because Qualcomm’s at times contentious dealings with its customers have become a focal point in Broadcom’s takeover effort. Broadcom’s leaders argue they can boost Qualcomm’s value by taking over the San Diego-based company and resolving some of its disputes with customers.  Terms of the Samsung deal are also important. Qualcomm has two business lines, one that sells chips and another that charges licensing fees to handset makers like Apple and Samsung based on a cut of the selling price of their phones. The device licensing has been the focus of many of Qualcomm’s regulatory and customer disputes, with Apple calling it an unjust “tax.” Broadcom’s leaders have hinted they might modify it. On Qualcomm’s earnings call, Alex Rogers, head of the company’s licensing division, told investors Samsung would still pay royalties on handset sales, rather than combining the royalty agreement with its chip purchases. A Qualcomm spokesman declined to elaborate on the specifics of the Samsung deal, an amendment to a 2009 agreement under which Samsung paid $1.3 billion upfront and then an ongoing rate that many analysts believed was different - and possibly lower - than what other device makers paid. But in getting Samsung to drop its regulatory action and come back to the negotiating table, Qualcomm is hoping to show it can patch things up with customers without Broadcom’s help. “We remain open to finding a path to resolution and back to collaboration with Apple,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf said on the investor call.

1000,QCOM,Qualcomm profit beats estimates but weak China mobile sales weigh on outlook,"(Reuters) - Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc’s profit and revenue beat expectations as demand surged for its chips used in smartphones and cars, but an earnings forecast for the current quarter fell below analysts’ estimates due to tepid mobile sales in China. China’s smartphone market in 2017 was weaker than expected with 4G handset shipments down 11 percent, according to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.  “Performance of the current quarter is weighed down by Apple and China,” Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy said. “If there wasn’t the Broadcom bid the stock might be down 5 percent instead ... I don’t think investors are focused really on the near term operating results or even guidance at this point,” he said. Shares of the company were marginally lower in late trade. The company’s CDMA technologies unit, its largest business, saw a 13 percent rise in revenue to $4.65 billion in the first quarter ended Dec. 24. But licensing revenue dropped 28 percent to $1.30 billion, weighed down by a dispute with Apple Inc. Apple sued Qualcomm last January, accusing it of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. “We remain open to finding a path to resolution (with Apple),” Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said on a call with analysts. The company forecast second-quarter revenue of $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share of 65 cents to 75 cents, below analysts’ estimates for revenue of $5.58 billion and earnings of 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In the first quarter, Qualcomm posted a net loss of $5.95 billion due to a $6 billion charge for new U.S. tax laws and a $868 million charge for a fine imposed by the Korea Fair Trade Commission. Excluding items, Qualcomm earned 98 cents per share, topping analysts’ average estimate of 91 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 1.2 percent to $6.07 billion and exceeded estimates of $5.93 billion. Qualcomm is in the midst of closing its long-pending $38-billion deal to buy automotive chip maker NXP Semiconductors. In November, it rebuffed a $103-billion takeover bid by Broadcom Ltd.

1002,QCOM,UPDATE 6-Broadcom unveils $121 bln 'best and final' offer for Qualcomm,"(Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd made a $121 billion “best and final offer” on Monday to acquire Qualcomm Inc, ratcheting up pressure on its U.S. semiconductor peer to engage in talks on what would be the biggest ever technology acquisition.  The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices. Qualcomm responded that its board of directors would review the latest offer, and declined to comment further until then. Broadcom’s new $82 per share offer included $60 in cash and $22 in Broadcom stock. Its first offer, of $70 per share, in November comprised $60 in cash and $10 in stock. The increased stock component would subject the deal to a Broadcom shareholder vote. Reuters first reported on Broadcom’s new offer on Sunday. Qualcomm shares fell 4.3 percent to $63.20 at mid-afternoon on doubts about the deal’s prospects, as well a KGI Securities report that said Apple might drop the chipmaker in favor of Intel Corp to supply modem chips for its next-generation iPhones. Broadcom shares edged up 0.2 percent to $235.77. “Qualcomm and its board now have a tough decision, as this is a compelling offer in our opinion,” said analyst Daniel Ives of GBH Insights. Singapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. Qualcomm primarily licenses its technology for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology. Qualcomm is locked in a patent dispute with Apple over its licensing agreements. “Qualcomm got where it did in the last 30 years with a business model hinging on intellectual property licensing that is, at this day and age, not sustainable. You can sell products, as Broadcom does, very successfully, and generate a very good return for your shareholders,” Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan said in an interview. In a presentation issued on its website, Broadcom criticized Qualcomm’s management team, led by its CEO Steve Mollenkopf, for its total shareholder returns of negative 7 percent since 2005, while the wider semiconductor index has returned 106 percent. In January, Qualcomm announced an ambitious 2019 profit target predicated on a new $1 billion cost reduction plan and resolving licensing disputes, including with Apple. Broadcom said there was no reason to believe Qualcomm’s latest initiative would be successful. Broadcom also announced concessions to address Qualcomm’s concerns that their combination could take more than 18 months to secure regulatory approval, and that divestitures demanded by antitrust watchdogs could be financially burdensome. Broadcom said it was willing pay Qualcomm a “ticking fee” if the transaction is not completed within its target of 12 months after any definitive agreement. It would also pay a significant “reverse termination fee” if regulators scuttle the deal. Broadcom’s antitrust counsel, Daniel Wall of Latham & Watkins LLP, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that Broadcom was willing to sell two Qualcomm businesses to resolve any antitrust problems. These are its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones. “There is no antitrust issue. The overlap is very limited in this transaction. People talk about us making even more commitments on the regulatory front, like adding hell-or-high water provisions, which are not a very well defined legal standard, and we chose not to include it because it would not add much incremental certainty,” said Tan. Broadcom said on Monday its improved offer was premised on either Qualcomm acquiring NXP Semiconductors NV on the current disclosed terms of $110 per share in cash, or the $38 billion transaction being terminated. NXP shareholders, led by activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, are resisting the deal, pushing for Qualcomm to raise its offer. NXP shares were trading at $119.16 on Monday afternoon, indicating investors were expecting a sweeter deal. Qualcomm’s proposed acquisition of NXP was approved by European Union antitrust regulators last month. Qualcomm expects China’s blessing later this month, at which point it has to decide whether it would raise its offer. At Qualcomm’s March 6 shareholder meeting, Broadcom plans to nominate a slate of directors to replace Qualcomm’s board. That remains the company’s focus unless Qualcomm agrees to negotiate, Tan said. When asked, he did not exclude the option of launching a direct offer for Qualcomm shares. “We are going all the way to Qualcomm’s shareholder meeting of March 6,” Tan said.

1003,QCOM,Qualcomm shares fall as reports say Apple may scrap its chips,"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc’s (QCOM.O) shares fell 3 percent on Monday after two brokerages said Apple Inc (AAPL.O) might drop the chipmaker in favor of Intel Corp (INTC.O) as the supplier for modem chips in its next generation of iPhones. Qualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years but the relationship turned sour last year when Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. In a detailed note citing extensive channel checks with chip suppliers, brokerage Nomura Instinet said it anticipated that Apple would drop Qualcomm in favor of a handful of other suppliers, as it seeks to reduce materials costs for iPhones. Nomura said it believed Apple would source all of its thin modems - half of which are currently supplied by Qualcomm - from Intel. Intel shares were up 1.4 percent at $46.81. The world’s biggest PC chipmaker was a late entrant into the market for mobile chips, but has recently been pushing aggressively into the space. “There is speculation that Apple might drop Qualcomm altogether for its next generation phones and I think that’s part of the reason the stock is down today,” said Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research. Qualcomm issued a revenue forecast last week that missed estimates. It said the forecast already included the assumption that Apple could drop its chips for future products. Apple will save more than $100 million in the next iPhone cycle by moving to cheaper Intel modem chips, Nomura analyst Romit Shah said. Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O), which is trying to acquire Qualcomm, will likely lose some $400 million worth of sales of Apple parts in the second half of the year to Qorvo Inc (QRVO.O), Shah added. The reports came as Broadcom on Monday sweetened its bid to buy Qualcomm to more than $121 billion from an earlier $103 billion. Qualcomm was hit with a $1.23 billion fine by European Union antitrust regulators last month for paying Apple to use only its chips, blocking out rivals such as Intel. Intel began supplying modem chips to Apple from the iPhone 7 onwards. Reuters reported in October that Apple had designed iPhones and iPads that would drop chips supplied by Qualcomm. reut.rs/2nNkkGC Analysts at KGI Securities said Intel's modem chips were less expensive than Qualcomm chips and also met Apple's standards, according to Apple news website 9to5Mac. bit.ly/2FKdoBB Sector analysts have said in the past that Intel may not be as well prepared for 5G networking as Qualcomm, and that iPhones with Qualcomm chips have performed better than models running on Intel chips. KGI Securities did not rule out a return by Qualcomm to the supply chain, perhaps in the form of concessions in the patent lawsuit settlement. Apple and Intel declined to comment. Qualcomm did not immediately responded to a request for comment.

1005,QCOM,"Exclusive: Broadcom to raise Qualcomm bid in push for talks, sources say","(Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) plans to unveil a new approximately $120 billion offer for Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) on Monday, aiming to ratchet up pressure on its U.S. semiconductor peer to engage in negotiations, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.  The move comes ahead of a Qualcomm shareholder meeting scheduled for March 6, when Broadcom is seeking to replace Qualcomm’s board of directors by nominating its own slate for election.  Broadcom is scheduled to meet with its advisers later on Sunday to finalize an offer that values Qualcomm between $80 and $82 per share, two of the sources said. Broadcom’s previous $70 per share offer consisted of $60 per share in cash and $10 per share in stock.  Broadcom also plans to offer Qualcomm a higher-than-usual breakup fee in the event regulators thwart the deal, according to the sources. Typically, such break-up fees equate to approximately 3 percent to 4 percent of a deal’s size.  The sources cautioned that Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan may decide to significantly change the terms at the last minute. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Broadcom and Qualcomm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Broadcom has said it is very confident a deal can be completed within 12 months of signing an agreement. Qualcomm counters that the regulatory review processes required around the world would take more than 18 months and be fraught with risks. Qualcomm provides chips to mobile carrier networks to deliver broadband and data, making it an attractive acquisition target for Broadcom, which hopes to expand its offerings in so-called 5G wireless technology.  Qualcomm has argued to its shareholders that Broadcom’s hostile bid is aimed at acquiring the company on the cheap. Qualcomm reported quarterly profit and revenues last week that beat analysts’ expectations as demand surged for its chips used in smartphones and cars. However, its forecast was below estimates due to tepid mobile phone sales in China. Qualcomm is engaged in a patent infringement dispute with Apple Inc (AAPL.O). Qualcomm has said the litigation is necessary in order to defend is licensing programs. Qualcomm is also trying to clinch an acquisition of its own, proposing to buy NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) for $38 billion. The deal was approved by European Union antitrust regulators last month, and only China has yet to approve it. Qualcomm expects the government’s blessing later this month. The NXP deal still faces an uncertain future as some of its shareholders, including activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, have asked Qualcomm to raise its offer. Qualcomm is expected to make a decision later this month.

1021,QCOM,"UPDATE 3-Qualcomm rejects Broadcom's revised buyout offer, proposes meeting","(Adds Broadcom CEO comment and details including breakup fee and ticking fee from Broadcom letter) By Greg Roumeliotis and Diane Bartz Feb 8 (Reuters) - U.S. semiconductor company Qualcomm Inc on Thursday rejected Broadcom Ltd’s revised $121 billion buyout offer, but proposed meeting its peer to see whether they can address what it called the bid’s “serious deficiencies in value and certainty.” Qualcomm’s response attempts to strike a balance between continued resistance of Broadcom’s takeover attempt and heeding the calls of some Qualcomm shareholders, who urged the company in recent days to engage with its rival in case it can clinch an attractive deal. Broadcom said it proposed to meet by this weekend, but Qualcomm was not willing to meet until Tuesday, after the two companies’ respective meetings with proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS. “We hope that your willingness to meet with us reflects Qualcomm’s genuine intent to reach an agreement with respect to our February 5 proposal,” Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told Qualcomm Executive Chairman Paul Jacobs in a letter published by Broadcom. Broadcom said its latest offer was “best and final” and that it had strong Qualcomm stockholder support. Qualcomm had rejected Broadcom’s first unsolicited $103 billion acquisition offer in November, without engaging further. In response, Broadcom nominated a slate of directors to replace Qualcomm’s board. Qualcomm shareholders are scheduled to vote on these nominations at a March 6 meeting. Qualcomm said Broadcom’s latest $82 per share offer, comprising $60 per share in cash and $22 per share in stock, “materially undervalues” Qualcomm and falls short of the firm regulatory commitment it would demand given the significant antitrust risks involved. Qualcomm shares were up 1.1 percent at $63.12 in after-hours trading on Thursday. Broadcom shares were up 1 percent at $232.00. Broadcom has promised to pay a breakup fee of $8 billion in the event regulators thwart the deal, as well as a “ticking” fee of 6 percent per year on the cash portion of the consideration if the deal takes more than 12 months to close. Qualcomm argued on Thursday this would not compensate Qualcomm if several large customers were to walk away or infringe their licensing agreements. It believes Broadcom needs to offer a “hell-or-high-water” legal commitment to complete the deal irrespective of divestitures that antitrust watchdogs around the world may require. “If you are not willing to agree to do whatever is necessary to ensure a transaction closes, we will need you to be extremely clear and specific about exactly what actions you would refuse to take, so that we can properly evaluate the risk to Qualcomm’s shareholders,” Qualcomm’s Jacobs wrote to Broadcom’s Tan in a letter published by Qualcomm. Qualcomm also said in its statement that Broadcom’s plan to address antitrust concerns by selling two Qualcomm businesses, its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones, was inadequate to allay concerns that the deal would not win regulatory approval. Qualcomm added that the regulatory approval process could take longer than 18 months and disrupt Qualcomm during a period of explosive innovation in the industry that includes the development of 5G mobile phones, autonomous driving and the expanding use of computerized gadgets from refrigerators to thermostats. The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices. Singapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. Qualcomm primarily licenses its technology for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology. Broadcom said on Monday its improved offer was premised on either Qualcomm acquiring NXP Semiconductors NV at the current disclosed terms of $110 per share in cash, or the $38 billion transaction being terminated. NXP shareholders, led by activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp, are resisting the deal, pushing for Qualcomm to raise its offer. NXP shares closed at $115.94 on Thursday, indicating investors were expecting a sweeter deal. Qualcomm’s proposed acquisition of NXP was approved by European Union antitrust regulators last month. Qualcomm expects China’s blessing as early as this month, at which point it has to decide whether it would raise its offer.

1032,QCOM,Broadcom scales back Qualcomm board challenge to simple majority,"(Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) cut the number of board seats it was trying to win at Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) to six from 11 on Tuesday, saying this would let Qualcomm shareholders push the U.S. chip maker toward a sale while ensuring continuity. The move came following Singapore-based Broadcom’s meeting with proxy advisory firm ISS on Monday and concern from some Qualcomm shareholders that replacing the company’s entire 11-member board could create uncertainty during the time it would take to complete a combination of the two companies. The move on board seats comes a day ahead of planned talks between the semiconductor companies to discuss Broadcom’s $121 billion cash-and-stock acquisition offer, which will be their first such discussion. Broadcom said the change would let Qualcomm stockholders direct a simple majority of the board to negotiate a deal while also ensuring that the remaining five directors who are familiar with the company continue to oversee it. Broadcom’s six nominees are Samih Elhage, David Golden, Veronica Hagen, Julie Hill, John Kispert and Harry You. The company said it would withdraw its offer if it was not accepted by Qualcomm’s executives or unless its six nominees were elected at Qualcomm’s shareholder meeting scheduled for March 6.  Qualcomm offered no comment. The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) use their market dominance to negotiate down chip prices. Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily licenses its technology for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology. The difference in their business models has led to Qualcomm raising concerns that its licensing agreements with customers could be upended should a deal with Broadcom be announced. It has warned that regulators could take more than 18 months to approve the deal, and may never do so. Broadcom has countered it believes it can complete the deal in 12 months. Qualcomm has been a supplier of components to Apple for years, but the relationship soured last year when Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refused to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple and Qualcomm are now locked in a bitter legal dispute. Broadcom raised its cash-and-stock offer last week to $82 per share from $70, and made other concessions. They include offering to pay Qualcomm an $8 billion breakup fee should antitrust regulators block the deal. Qualcomm rejected the revised offer, as it did the first bid, saying the proposal undervalued the company and fell well short of commitments on regulatory issues.

The outcome of the meeting will determine whether Qualcomm, which has resisted Broadcom’s takeover approach since November, will engage in negotiations or continue to defend itself by rallying its shareholders, who are scheduled to vote on March 6 on replacing the majority of its board with Broadcom nominees. Neither side commented on what transpired in the two-hour meeting. Qualcomm said in its statement its board would meet to determine its next steps. Broadcom’s top executives left the meeting with the impression that their Qualcomm counterparts listened to them but did not engage, according to sources familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because it was private. The meeting came after Qualcomm rejected Broadcom’s revised cash-and-stock bid of $82 per share last week and said the new offer still undervalued it and fell well short of the firm commitments on regulatory issues it expected. Qualcomm had said it would take the meeting to allow Broadcom to explain how it would attempt to bridge the gaps in both value and deal certainty and to better understand the issues that remained unaddressed in its proposal.  Qualcomm said last week that Broadcom’s plan to address antitrust concerns by selling two Qualcomm businesses, its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones, was inadequate to allay concerns that the deal would not win regulatory approval.

Qualcomm’s response raises the stakes in a battle over what would be the technology sector’s largest-ever acquisition. The two companies have less than three weeks to negotiate a potential deal until Qualcomm shareholders are asked to vote on a challenge by Broadcom to Qualcomm’s board of directors. Qualcomm has been seeking to walk a fine line between resisting Broadcom’s acquisition approach, which it says undervalues it and is fraught with regulatory risks, and demonstrating to its shareholders and proxy advisory firms that it is willing to engage to secure a better deal if possible. “While the current Broadcom proposal is unacceptable, our board is intensely focused on maximizing value for Qualcomm stockholders, whether through executing on its growth strategy or by selling the company,” Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs wrote to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan on Friday in a letter released by Qualcomm. Broadcom offered no immediate comment. Qualcomm shares were up 0.4 percent at $65.60, significantly below Broadcom’s latest $82 per share cash-and-stock offer. Broadcom shares were down 0.8 percent at $249.89. Qualcomm’s meeting with Broadcom on Feb. 14 was the first time the two companies met to discuss a potential combination since Broadcom unveiled its unsolicited bid last November. As part of the takeover battle, Broadcom is asking Qualcomm shareholders to back its effort to replace a majority of Qualcomm’s board of directors in a vote scheduled for March 6. It has called its latest bid its best and final offer. “While it sounds like the parties remain very far apart on the specifics (price, risk mitigation, etc), actual negotiations (with an understanding of opening positions) do appear to have kicked off, and Qualcomm is at least contemplating the bare possibility that they might get sold,” analyst Stacy Rasgon at Bernstein said.  In the meeting this week, Singapore-based Broadcom was willing to make certain divestitures to satisfy antitrust regulators, but was still resistant to “other commitments that could be expected” to be required by government regulatory bodies, Qualcomm said. Broadcom has already said it is willing to sell two Qualcomm businesses to resolve any antitrust problems. These are its Wi-Fi networking processors and RF Front End chips for mobile phones. In the meeting, Broadcom agreed to divest if needed its own Wi-Fi business, instead of Qualcomm’s, a source familiar with the confidential details of the meeting said. Broadcom also wanted Qualcomm to include in the merger agreement that Qualcomm will refrain from lawsuits related to licensing while the deal is being reviewed by regulators, according to the source. Qualcomm did not agree to that. Qualcomm reiterated that Broadcom’s promised breakup fee of $8 billion in the event regulators thwart the deal did not come close to compensating for risks related to the deal.

Qualcomm has been seeking to walk a fine line between resisting Broadcom’s acquisition approach, which it says undervalues it and is fraught with regulatory risks, and demonstrating to shareholders and proxy advisory firms such as ISS that it is willing to engage to secure a better deal if possible. In a report published late on Friday, ISS recommended to Qualcomm shareholders that they vote for four out of the six board director nominees that Broadcom has put forward for election at Qualcomm’s shareholder meeting on March 6. While this recommendation would fall short of Broadcom’s nominees winning a majority on Qualcomm’s 11-member board, ISS said such a vote by Qualcomm shareholders would offer a reasonable path to a negotiated deal that would deliver value. “The tenor of (Qualcomm’s) engagement leading up to the present raises questions as to whether the incumbent (Qualcomm) board is committed to playing its part in attempting to maximize the offer,” ISS said in its report. Broadcom first unveiled an unsolicited $70 per share cash-and-stock offer in November, which Qualcomm rejected. It raised its offer to $82 per share in cash and stock on Feb. 5 and offered other concessions, including paying an $8 billion breakup fee in the event regulators thwart the deal, which would be the technology sector’s largest-ever acquisition. ISS said it did not recommend voting for all six Broadcom nominees because Qualcomm’s board would then be less inclined to drive a hard bargain with Broadcom in deal negotiations.      ISS recommended that Broadcom nominees Samih Elhage, Julie Hill, John Kispert and Harry You should be elected as Qualcomm board directors. Qualcomm on Friday called a Feb. 14 meeting with Broadcom constructive and opened the door to more talks, but continued to reject the proposed deal.  As of Saturday afternoon, no new meeting between the two companies had been scheduled, according to people familiar with the matter.

ISS added, however, that the offer seemed to represent a reasonable starting point for negotiations. Even though both companies “have adopted strategies that do not lend themselves to fluid negotiations,” a deal between them is possible, ISS said. It suggested that Qualcomm shareholders could gain greater exposure to the deal’s potential upside if they were to receive more of the combined company.  ISS also said it appeared more likely than not that Broadcom and Qualcomm, with their collective experience and resources, can find a reasonable path to regulatory approval, despite Qualcomm’s current concerns about antitrust risk.  Qualcomm is currently seeking to complete a $38 billion deal to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV, which is still pending regulatory approval.

ISS said in its report that Qualcomm could negotiate provisions with Broadcom to close the NXP deal at a mutually agreed price, which would provide Qualcomm with the “next-best safety net of diversification” in the event the deal with Broadcom falls through.  China’s MOFCOM is the only regulator globally required to approve the Qualcomm-NXP deal that has yet to do so. With the start of the Chinese New Year public holiday this week, Qualcomm may now delay its decision on raising its offer for NXP until after the March 6 Qualcomm shareholder meeting.

1046,QCOM,Qualcomm deals blow to Broadcom's bid with sweetened NXP deal,"(Reuters) - U.S. semiconductor company Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) on Tuesday unveiled a sweetened $44 billion agreement to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O), its most defiant move in its defense against a hostile $121 billion bid from Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O). The new deal puts pressure on Broadcom to decide if it will stick with a stipulation in its bid that Qualcomm does not raise its offer for NXP. It could strengthen Qualcomm’s defenses because it allows its shareholders to better assess the standalone value of Qualcomm as an alternative to a deal with Broadcom. Qualcomm shares fell 1.3 percent to $63.99, significantly below Broadcom’s latest $82 per share cash-and-stock offer unveiled on Feb. 5, as investors saw the new NXP deal as increasing the chances of Qualcomm repelling Broadcom. Broadcom said on Tuesday it was evaluating its options in response to Qualcomm’s move and noted that the revised price for NXP was well beyond what Qualcomm has repeatedly characterized as “full and fair.” It called the new deal a transfer of value from Qualcomm shareholders to NXP shareholders. In an interview with Reuters, Qualcomm’s presiding board director Tom Horton argued that the revised deal with NXP represented value for Qualcomm shareholders irrespective of the outcome of the takeover battle with Broadcom. “It makes Qualcomm stronger and more profitable and diversified if there is no deal with Broadcom, and if we do decide to pursue a sale the same is true, more value would accrue to the Qualcomm shareholders,” Horton said. Qualcomm raised its offer for NXP from $110 to $127.50 per share in cash. In exchange, it received binding agreements from nine NXP stockholders that collectively own more than 28 percent of NXP’s outstanding shares to support the deal. These include hedge funds Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd and Soroban Capital Partners LP, which had spearheaded opposition to the NXP deal. NXP’s shares rose 6 percent to $125.56. The stock had traded above the original offer price for nearly seven months, reflecting expectations among investors that Qualcomm’s offer would be raised. NXP shareholders have to tender their shares in an offer that is currently set to expire on March 5, though Qualcomm has repeatedly pushed back this deadline as it awaits clearance from China’s MOFCOM, the only regulator globally needed to approved the deal that has yet to do so. The Chinese New Year holiday this month has delayed this review. Under the new terms agreed with NXP’s board, the deal with Qualcomm is contingent on 70 percent of NXP’s shares being tendered, instead of the 80 percent threshold required in the earlier agreement signed in October 2016. Once this threshold is reached, Qualcomm can take over the entire company through a “second-step” transaction mechanism. The new NXP deal came less than a week after Broadcom and Qualcomm executives met face-to-face for the first time to discuss the differences between the two sides. Qualcomm called the meeting constructive but reiterated it had several concerns over price and regulatory risk. The acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm to expand in the fast-growing market for chips used in automobiles and reduce its dependence on the competitive smartphone market. The takeover battle between Qualcomm and Broadcom is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) use their market dominance to negotiate lower chip prices. Singapore-based Broadcom is mainly a manufacturer whose connectivity chips are used in products ranging from mobile phones to servers. San Diego-based Qualcomm primarily outsources the manufacturing of its chips which are used for the delivery of broadband and data, a business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology. To put pressure on Qualcomm, Broadcom has put forward six nominees up for election at Qualcomm’s March 6 shareholder meeting to replace the majority of the company’s eleven-member board of directors.  Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis on Tuesday recommended Qualcomm shareholders vote for all six director nominees Broadcom has put forward.  Last week, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) had recommended for the election of four Broadcom nominees. While this recommendation would fall short of Broadcom’s nominees winning a majority on Qualcomm’s board, ISS said such a vote by Qualcomm shareholders would offer a reasonable path to a negotiated deal that would deliver value. “ISS and Glass Lewis only influence a minority of our shareholders. They belie the fact that the Qualcomm board is doing everything it can in the furtherance of the interests of its shareholders. The ISS and Glass Lewis reports are also dated because they came out before certainty was secured on the NXP deal,” Horton said.

1055,QCOM,Broadcom cuts Qualcomm offer to $117 billion after new NXP deal,"(Reuters) - Microchip maker Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) cut its bid for Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) on Wednesday by 4 percent to $117 billion as it objected to Qualcomm’s decision to raise its own bid for NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) to $44 billion. Qualcomm responded that Broadcom had made “an inadequate offer even worse,” setting up a showdown on March 6, when Qualcomm shareholders are scheduled to elect an 11-member board and decide whether to hand control to a slate of six nominees put forward by Broadcom. A tie-up between Broadcom and Qualcomm would be the biggest technology acquisition ever. The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) use their market dominance to negotiate lower chip prices. Broadcom said that Qualcomm’s raised bid would amount to overpaying for NXP and cut its own bid as a result. “Qualcomm’s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders,” Broadcom said in its statement on Wednesday. The moves raise the chances that Qualcomm will buy NXP and lowered the chances of a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, CFRA Research analyst Scott Kessler wrote. Broadcom also criticized Qualcomm on Wednesday for not liaising with it before raising its NXP bid, as proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc had recommended. Qualcomm on Wednesday defended the value of the NXP deal, which it argued would expand Qualcomm’s markets and offer cost savings, and said Broadcom had refused to engage in discussions on the value of Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. The deal with Broadcom continued to face a “highly uncertain path to regulatory approvals,” Qualcomm added. Qualcomm shares were trading down 0.5 percent at $63.53 on Wednesday afternoon in New York, while Broadcom shares were up 1.2 percent at $252.69.  Qualcomm raised its offer for NXP from $110 to $127.50 per share in cash on Tuesday.  In exchange, it received binding agreements from nine NXP stockholders that collectively own more than 28 percent of NXP’s outstanding shares to support the deal. These include hedge funds Elliott Advisors (UK) Ltd and Soroban Capital Partners LP, which had pushed for a higher price.  Broadcom’s latest $82 per share cash-and-stock offer for Qualcomm was contingent on it buying NXP at its earlier offered price of $110 per share. Broadcom said on Wednesday that if the NXP deal goes ahead at $127.50, it will reduce the cash portion of its bid for Qualcomm by $3 per share.  Qualcomm is contractually obligated to complete the NXP deal, so that acquisition could fall apart only if too few NXP shareholders support the tender offer or if China’s MOFCOM, the only relevant regulator that has yet to approve the deal, blocks it.  Under the new terms agreed with NXP’s board, the deal with Qualcomm is contingent on 70 percent of NXP’s shares being tendered, instead of the 80 percent threshold required in the earlier agreement signed in October 2016.

NXP shares were trading at $125.70 on Wednesday, close to the new deal price, indicating that most investors think the acquisition will go through.

1059,QCOM,"Temenos agrees 1.4 billion pounds deal for Fidessa, activist Elliott enters","ZURICH (Reuters) - Temenos agreed a 1.4 billion pound ($1.96 billion) takeover of British software peer Fidessa Group on Wednesday, whose shares traded above the offer price after activist investor Elliott Capital Advisors disclosed a stake. The two companies announced advanced takeover talks a day earlier as Swiss Temenos looked to add Fidessa’s equities trading technology to expand its customer base in the financial services industry. Fidessa shareholders would get 35.67 pounds for each share in the all-cash deal, expected to be completed in the first half of 2018. The British company’s investors will also get a combined final and special dividend of 79.7 pence for 2017. The price represented a premium of roughly 36.9 percent on Fidessa’s opening price of 26.05 pounds per share on Feb. 16. Temenos shares slipped 0.6 percent by 1045 GMT, while Fidessa’s stock hit a high of 37.45 pounds before easing to 36.85 pounds.  As Temenos is proposing to buy Fidessa by way of a scheme of arrangement, Fidessa needs the backing of 75 percent of its shareholders for the deal to go through. Activist investor Elliott Capital Advisors disclosed a 4.8715 percent stake in Fidessa on Wednesday. It declined to comment on its intentions. Elliott has become active in Britain and has used its involvement in takeover targets to extract a higher price from buyers.  It was among investment firms that forced Belgium-based brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev to raise its offer for rival beer business SABMiller in 2016, a $110 billion deal that was the UK’s biggest corporate takeover.  It also has the equivalent of 7.1 percent in NXP Semiconductors [NXPSM.UL], which was the subject of a sweetened $44 billion offer from U.S. peer Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday in exchange for agreements from nine NXP stockholders, including Elliott.  Temenos said it is borrowing up to 1.43 billion pounds to pay for its biggest ever acquisition and would later raise cash on the capital markets to reduce its debt. It declined to comment on the size of the capital raising.  Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Andreas Mueller estimated it could look to raise $400 million to $450 million. The deal “will accelerate both companies’ complementary growth strategies in banking and capital markets and will enable us to cross-sell into our existing client bases and capture a greater share of the IT and software spend of banks especially as they move to the cloud”, Temenos Chairman Andreas Andreades said in a statement.  The enlarged company would have had revenues of more than $1.2 billion in 2017, and a core profit margin of 32.3 percent, which Temenos said it expected to increase to 37 percent after annual savings of $60 million were achieved. Temenos said it expected the deal to be earnings accretive in 2018, and boost earnings per share in the mid-teen percentage range from 2019 onwards. Andreades said software in the capital markets industry was  highly fragmented and dominated by older systems, creating an opportunity for the combined company’s offering.

1060,QCOM,"UPDATE 2-Temenos agrees 1.4 bln stg deal for Fidessa, activist Elliott enters","ZURICH (Reuters) - Temenos agreed a 1.4 billion pound ($1.96 billion) takeover of British software peer Fidessa Group on Wednesday, whose shares traded above the offer price after activist investor Elliott Capital Advisors disclosed a stake. The two companies announced advanced takeover talks a day earlier as Swiss Temenos looked to add Fidessa’s equities trading technology to expand its customer base in the financial services industry. Fidessa shareholders would get 35.67 pounds for each share in the all-cash deal, expected to be completed in the first half of 2018. The British company’s investors will also get a combined final and special dividend of 79.7 pence for 2017. The price represented a premium of roughly 36.9 percent on Fidessa’s opening price of 26.05 pounds per share on Feb. 16. Temenos shares slipped 0.6 percent by 1045 GMT, while Fidessa’s stock hit a high of 37.45 pounds before easing to 36.85 pounds.  As Temenos is proposing to buy Fidessa by way of a scheme of arrangement, Fidessa needs the backing of 75 percent of its shareholders for the deal to go through. Activist investor Elliott Capital Advisors disclosed a 4.8715 percent stake in Fidessa on Wednesday. It declined to comment on its intentions. Elliott has become active in Britain and has used its involvement in takeover targets to extract a higher price from buyers.  It was among investment firms that forced Belgium-based brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev to raise its offer for rival beer business SABMiller in 2016, a $110 billion deal that was the UK’s biggest corporate takeover.  It also has the equivalent of 7.1 percent in NXP Semiconductors [NXPSM.UL], which was the subject of a sweetened $44 billion offer from U.S. peer Qualcomm Inc on Tuesday in exchange for agreements from nine NXP stockholders, including Elliott.  Temenos said it is borrowing up to 1.43 billion pounds to pay for its biggest ever acquisition and would later raise cash on the capital markets to reduce its debt. It declined to comment on the size of the capital raising.  Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Andreas Mueller estimated it could look to raise $400 million to $450 million. The deal “will accelerate both companies’ complementary growth strategies in banking and capital markets and will enable us to cross-sell into our existing client bases and capture a greater share of the IT and software spend of banks especially as they move to the cloud”, Temenos Chairman Andreas Andreades said in a statement.  The enlarged company would have had revenues of more than $1.2 billion in 2017, and a core profit margin of 32.3 percent, which Temenos said it expected to increase to 37 percent after annual savings of $60 million were achieved. Temenos said it expected the deal to be earnings accretive in 2018, and boost earnings per share in the mid-teen percentage range from 2019 onwards. Andreades said software in the capital markets industry was  highly fragmented and dominated by older systems, creating an opportunity for the combined company’s offering. Financial institutions spent an estimated $14 billion on capital markets software in 2018, with $3 billion going to third party vendors like Temenos. Such total spend is expected to grow by 8 percent per year, the company said. “The synergies, which are higher than we expected, and the increase in sales and increase in adjusted earnings from the first year are positive aspects,” said ZKB’s Mueller.  “The industrial logic is clear.

1063,QCOM,Broadcom calls Qualcomm's offer for price talks 'engagement theater',"(Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) on Monday called a proposal by U.S. semiconductor peer Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) for a new meeting to negotiate an increase to Broadcom’s $117 billion acquisition offer “engagement theater” aimed at dodging a takeover battle. Broadcom’s statement came after Qualcomm said earlier on Monday that all of Broadcom’s previous offers - which would represent the largest technology deal on record - materially undervalued it, but that it wanted to negotiate further. Broadcom accused Qualcomm of feigning engagement in the companies’ two meetings earlier this month. It also said Qualcomm has refused to confirm that it will hold its previously scheduled stockholder vote on March 6. Broadcom has put forward six nominees for election to Qualcomm’s 11-member board as a way to force deal negotiations with Qualcomm. “Broadcom does not believe that the process outlined by Qualcomm today is designed to lead to a prompt agreement,” Broadcom said in a statement. Qualcomm responded by denying it was considering moving the date of its annual shareholder meeting. The company added in a statement that it had no intention of delaying the meeting, and said it had made that clear in talks with Broadcom on Friday. “The ball is in Broadcom’s court to let us know whether it is willing to engage with us,” Qualcomm said.  In a letter to Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs on Monday proposed a new meeting focused on price as soon as convenient for both parties.  While the two companies have not yet resolved their disagreements on how to address potential antitrust hurdles, Qualcomm said they had made progress on that front. “If the discussion is truly coming down to price alone, then we would call this progress,” said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) use their market dominance to negotiate lower chip prices. Broadcom cut its bid last week by 4 percent to $117 billion after Qualcomm’s decision to raise its own bid for NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) to $44 billion. Qualcomm’s shares rose 5.8 percent to close Monday’s trading at $66.98, still well below Broadcom’s latest cash-and-stock offer of $79 per share. Qualcomm also softened its approach to Broadcom’s commitments on regulatory approval for the deal, saying the path forward did not require a “hell or high water” commitment to sell any assets that the regulators require. Qualcomm, however, urged the Singapore-based chipmaker to provide more clarity regarding its plans for Qualcomm’s licensing business, which Broadcom has been unwilling to reveal. It also offered to sign a confidentiality agreement so both companies can carry out due diligence on one another. “We are willing to jointly select a law firm with antitrust expertise that you would fully brief on your licensing plans,” Qualcomm said. In a meeting with Broadcom on Friday, Qualcomm proposed a reverse termination fee of 9 percent of enterprise value if Broadcom fails to win regulatory approvals. Broadcom had previously proposed a $8 billion breakup fee. The company was not immediately available for comment.

Powell will face questions from both houses of the U.S. Congress in a semi-annual testimony starting on Tuesday, his first major set piece since he took over from Janet Yellen earlier this month. His testimony comes at a time when investors have been anxious about the pace of rate hikes, which have weighed on equity markets globally. Investors are hoping that Powell will keep the U.S. central bank on a steady course of monetary tightening. “There’s some talk of him (Powell) being a little more open to tolerating inflation running above the 2 percent target. The focus will be to see if he is indeed open to that and the rationale behind it,” said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K; Investment Management. The Fed said on Friday it expected economic growth to remain steady and saw no serious risks on the horizon that might pause its planned pace of rate hikes. The week is heavy on data, with a report on personal consumption expenditure, the Fed’s favorite gauge of inflation, expected on Thursday. At 9:34 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.82 percent to 25,518.53. The S&P; 500 gained 0.65 percent to 2,7565.18 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.73 percent at 7,390.81. The indexes have posted gains in the past two weeks. All 11 major S&P; sectors were higher, led by a 0.81 percent gain in the technology index. Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet were up between 0.99 percent and 1.2 percent. Berkshire Hathaway rose 1.8 percent after Warren Buffett said his conglomerate, which is sitting on $116 billion of cash, is “more inclined” to repurchase stock than pay dividends as a means to use excess cash. Qualcomm shares rose 1.6 percent after the chipmaker urged Broadcom to enter into price negotiations on its $117 billion offer for the company. Broadcom was down about 0.7 percent.

Wrapping up the move from Singapore and redomiciling in the United States relatively quickly could remove a roadblock to the proposed deal by calming concerns at the inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which has the power to stop deals that could harm national security. Broadcom said in November that it would return to the United States but did not say when the move would happen. Broadcom shareholders will vote on the proposal by May 6, after which it must be confirmed by a judge. Once that happens, which is expected in early to mid-May, the redomiciling can happen quickly, according to a source familiar with the matter. The entire process is likely to be wrapped up as soon as mid-May, the source added. Broadcom was a U.S. company until it was bought in 2016 by Singapore’s Avago, which decided to use the name Broadcom.  Despite Broadcom’s plans to move back to the United States, CFIUS has already shown an interest in the proposed transaction  because Broadcom has proposed six directors for Qualcomm’s 11-member board. The vote on that slate is set for Tuesday. Broadcom has argued that CFIUS’ concern is unwarranted since it does not control the directors that it proposed. “Broadcom could not and will not control the Qualcomm board - the essential basis for CFIUS jurisdiction - in the event some or all of the independent, Broadcom-nominated directors are elected,” the company said in a statement on Friday. It also reiterated it was confident it would be able to win regulatory approval for a deal to buy Qualcomm within approximately 12 months of reaching an agreement. Qualcomm has argued that Broadcom’s $117 billion offer undervalues the company. Broadcom has accused Qualcomm of failing to negotiate seriously, saying they were involved in “engagement theater.” ",3022018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-return-to-the-u-s-could-be-complete-in-mid-may-sources-idUSKCN1GE2Z3

The vote on that slate is set for Tuesday. Broadcom has argued that CFIUS’ concern is unwarranted since it does not control the directors that it proposed. “Broadcom could not and will not control the Qualcomm board - the essential basis for CFIUS jurisdiction - in the event some or all of the independent, Broadcom-nominated directors are elected,” the company said in a statement on Friday. It also reiterated it was confident it would be able to win regulatory approval for a deal to buy Qualcomm within approximately 12 months of reaching an agreement. Qualcomm has argued that Broadcom’s $117 billion offer undervalues the company. Broadcom has accused Qualcomm of failing to negotiate seriously, saying they were involved in “engagement theater.” ",3022018,http://www.reuters.com/article/qualcomm-ma-broadcom/broadcom-return-to-the-u-s-could-be-complete-in-mid-may-sources-idUSL2N1QK1B4
1079,QCOM,Republican lawmakers back review of Broadcom's Qualcomm bid,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican lawmakers on Monday backed a U.S. panel’s decision to delay semiconductor firm Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) shareholder meeting to allow for a more extensive review of Broadcom Ltd’s (AVGO.O) takeover bid. “I’m glad they’re taking a closer look at it. Qualcomm is a leader in 5G technology, which is going to be the new standard in the future,” said Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, who had pushed for further review. Saying China and other countries “have been incredibly aggressive and strategic,” Cornyn told reporters outside the Senate that a hostile takeover of the chipmaker by a foreign company would be a cause for concern. Broadcom is based in Singapore. “I support the idea that the committee on foreign investment takes a close look at that to see that American interests are protected,” he said. Senator Tom Cotton, a vocal Republican voice on foreign policy, also said he backed further review. “Qualcomm’s work is too important to our national security to let it fall into the hands of a foreign company — and in a hostile takeover no less,” Cotton said in a statement. The U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) on Sunday ordered Qualcomm to delay its March 8 shareholder meeting, an unprecedented move that cast new doubt on Broadcom’s $117 billion bid for its U.S. semiconductor peer.

1086,QCOM,Breakingviews - U.S. simplifies Qualcomm decision by complex means,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Washington has waded into Broadcom’s effort to buy rival chipmaker Qualcomm for $117 billion. America’s foreign-investment watchdog has told Qualcomm to delay by 30 days its annual shareholder meeting, previously set for Tuesday. The agenda includes director elections that could give board control to nominees of Singapore-based Broadcom. It’s a surprising twist in an already tangled situation. But it may remove a big unknown from the equation. Broadcom is blaming its target, saying Qualcomm sought a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and didn’t tell its shareholders or its suitor. If true, it counts as one of the sneakier ways to fend off a hostile takeover. Still, the U.S. Treasury-led CFIUS makes its own decisions. While the committee’s latest pre-emptive move is highly unusual, it’s not illogical. Having decamped to Singapore in search of lower taxes, Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan has promised to return his acquisitive $100 billion firm to the United States. That process could be completed in a few months, but for now Tan’s company is foreign, and it’s trying to make a big purchase in an important technology sector – one where U.S. lawmakers have made no secret of their intensifying sensitivities. CFIUS national-security reviews usually come after mergers are agreed. In this case, though, the uncommon circumstances may explain the early action. Broadcom has proposed six directors for Qualcomm’s 11-person board. Key proxy advisers have backed at least some of Broadcom’s slate, and that means the Singapore group’s nominees could end up controlling the U.S. company’s board – before any takeover is agreed by the two firms or their shareholders. Qualcomm gave Broadcom’s initial offer in November the cold shoulder but is now engaged in discussions, although not whole-heartedly. It’s also motivated to secure the last remaining antitrust approval for its own planned $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors. Getting that deal in the bag would boost its stand-alone outlook, and CFIUS’s intervention buys more time. If Broadcom is prepared to wait rather than walk away, though, the calculus for Qualcomm’s shareholders will become simpler. There are many other obstacles to a merger, including potential antitrust concerns in Washington and elsewhere. If a decision is now delayed until Broadcom’s domicile is no longer a sticking point, that will at least remove one uncertainty.",3052018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-breakingviews/breakingviews-u-s-simplifies-qualcomm-decision-by-complex-means-idUSKBN1GH2FX

1089,QCOM,UPDATE 4-U.S. sees national security risk from Broadcom's Qualcomm deal,"(Reuters) - A U.S. government national security panel has identified potential risks that warrant a full investigation of Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd’s (AVGO.O) $117 billion bid for chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), a senior U.S. Treasury official said in a letter to the companies on Monday. Shares of Qualcomm slid 3 percent on growing investor concern that such government scrutiny, unusual for a deal that has not yet been agreed, would scupper any takeover by Broadcom.  Some of the U.S. government’s concerns relate to risks associated with Broadcom’s relationships with foreign entities, Aimen Mir, the Treasury’s deputy assistant secretary for investment security, said in the letter, without identifying who those parties might be. The letter, dated March 5, was made public by Qualcomm on Tuesday. (bit.ly/2FtCesY) The U.S. government’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ordered a national security review of Broadcom’s proposed deal on Sunday in an unusual move that prompted Qualcomm to delay a March 6 shareholder meeting. The letter said that, as with every investigation, the review will consider the potential risk of an unnamed “actor” working through Broadcom to hurt U.S. national security, adding that the bulk of CFIUS’ concerns were classified. CFIUS, made up of representatives from the Departments of Defense, State, Justice, Treasury, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security, assesses proposed foreign deals to purchase U.S. assets to ensure they do not harm national security. The inter-agency body, led by the Treasury, rarely looks at mergers before companies have clinched an agreement, highlighting the urgency of U.S. concerns about safeguarding semiconductor technology. The review of the Broadcom deal illustrates the U.S. government’s expanding focus on the competitiveness of the national semiconductor industry as China advances, regulatory experts said.          The U.S. government is concerned that Chinese companies, including the big network equipment and mobile phone maker Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], will take advantage of any openings to take the lead in the next generation mobile phone networks known as 5G. “A shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative security consequences for the United States,” Mir’s letter said. Broadcom said in a statement it was cooperating with CFIUS. “There can be no question that an American Broadcom-Qualcomm combination will provide far more resources for investments and development to that end.” Broadcom said last year it plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore.  A source familiar with CFIUS’ thinking told Reuters on Monday that if Broadcom acquired Qualcomm, the U.S. military had concerns that within 10 years “there would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that’s essentially Huawei.” Huawei has been forging closer commercial ties with big telecom operators across Europe and Asia, putting the company in prime position to lead the global race for 5G networks despite U.S. concerns. Its has a dominant position in China, which is set to become the world’s biggest 5G market by far, but has also made inroads in the rest of world to compete with rivals such as Ericsson and Nokia in several lucrative markets, including countries that are longstanding U.S. allies.

Trump reiterated his plan to slap hefty import tariffs on steel and aluminum saying “trade wars aren’t so bad” even as lawmakers such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stepped up calls to scrap the proposal. Earlier in the day strategists said some investors were beginning to bet Trump would not follow through on the proposal, which they saw as a negotiating tactic in trade talks. But gains were limited by the uncertainty throughout the day. “The market doesn’t want to hear the uncertainty, the market wants to hear one way or another,” said Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. “If our worst fears are confirmed ... the market should have even greater losses than what we saw last week. Likewise if it seems we’re not going to have a trade war the market should go higher.” Jonathan Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders Investment Management in New York, said there are “no winners in a trade war.” “The market is basically grasping for straws around what the (tariff) policy is going to be. Based on the action we saw today it’s hoping it doesn’t turn into a trade war,” he said. Investors were also eyeing news that North Korea was open to the possibility of talks with the United States on denuclearization. “North Korea helps around the margin,” said Mackay. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.36 points, or 0.04 percent, to close at 24,884.12, the S&P; 500 gained 7.18 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,728.12 and the Nasdaq Composite added 41.30 points, or 0.56 percent, to 7,372.01. Most of the S&P;’s 11 sectors rose, with the materials index leading the gainers with a 1.1 percent increase as investors in that sector bet against a trade war, according to Independent Advisor Alliance’s Zaccarelli. Utilities was the biggest faller, with a 1.4 percent drop. Among the bigger movers of the day, Target fell 4.5 percent after the big-box retailer reported lower-than-expected profit for the holiday quarter. Qualcomm dropped 2.9 percent after a U.S. government national security panel said it identified potential risks that warrant a full investigation of Broadcom Ltd’s $117-billion bid for the chipmaker. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.87-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

By 2 p.m. ET all three indices had settled to trade flat or slightly higher on the day after a volatile morning marked chiefly by news that North Korea was open to the possibility of talks with the United States on denuclearization. “The President has followed through many other times, investors are waiting for the next one to come from him to give a firmer indication of which way he’s going to truly head,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “I think the market’s split at the moment on it,” The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded flat at 24,874.46. The S&P; 500 rose 0.13 percent to 2,724.62 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.35 percent to 7,356.09. Among bigger movers, shares in Target fell 5.6 percent after the big-box retailer reported lower-than-expected profit for the holiday quarter. Qualcomm dropped more than 3 percent after a U.S. government national security panel said it identified potential risks that warrant a full investigation of Broadcom Ltd’s $117 billion bid for the chipmaker. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,701 to 1,098. On the Nasdaq, 1,692 issues rose and 1,144 fell. “There’s a big narrative saying I’m going to be risk neutral and so the markets are going to oscillate,” said Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management in Monument, Colorado.

1096,QCOM,Exclusive: Secretive U.S. security panel discussing Broadcom's Qualcomm bid - sources,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A national security panel that can stop mergers that could harm U.S. security has begun looking at Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom Ltd’s plan to take over rival Qualcomm Inc, according to three sources familiar with the matter. CFIUS, an opaque inter-agency panel, has been in touch with at least one of the companies in the proposed merger, one source said, and met last month to discuss the potential merger of the two big semiconductor companies, according to two sources familiar with the matter.     Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday to have the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, officially review the proposed transaction before a key shareholder vote expected on March 6, according to a letter seen by Reuters. The pre-deal discussions by CFIUS — which are extremely rare — suggest Broadcom’s plans to move its headquarters to the United States before it completes its proposed purchase of Qualcomm may not be enough to sidestep a national security review that could threaten the deal.  Part of CFIUS’ current concern, which is echoed in Cornyn’s letter, could lie in the fact that Broadcom has failed to strike a deal with Qualcomm and has resorted to what is essentially a hostile takeover by putting forward a slate of six Broadcom nominees for Qualcomm’s 11-member board.  If the six are elected on March 6, the vote would give control of Qualcomm to Broadcom’s nominees. That would happen before a CFIUS review or antitrust review is complete.  “I urge CFIUS to promptly review Broadcom’s proposed acquisition of control of Qualcomm’s board, and to act prior to the March 6 Qualcomm meeting to address any national security concerns that may be identified,” Cornyn wrote to Secretary Mnuchin, according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. A spokesman for CFIUS declined to comment. Representatives for Cornyn did not respond to requests for comment. Broadcom said in a statement Tuesday that it plans to move from Singapore to the United States, following receipt of approvals expected by May 6, and once again be a U.S. corporation. “We remain confident in our ability to complete a transaction with Qualcomm within approximately 12 months following the signing of a definitive agreement,” Broadcom said. A CFIUS review in itself does not mean a deal will be halted. CFIUS, under former President Barack Obama and current President Donald Trump, has soured on high tech deals, particularly involving semiconductors, or involving sensitive information about American citizens. Microprocessor expert Linley Gwennap, of the Linley Group, said that Qualcomm had world-leading chips in several areas.  “Qualcomm is a crown jewel of the American semiconductor industry,” he said. “I would think that CFIUS would be very protective of that. ... Singapore is nominally a friendly country but it still seems dangerous for that level of technology to go overseas.” Broadcom, which is based in Singapore, struggled to win CFIUS approval to buy Brocade Communications Systems late last year. In the end, that approval came just weeks after Broadcom CEO Hock Tan announced in an Oval Office ceremony with Trump that Broadcom would return its headquarters to the United States. Lawyers who take deals to CFIUS and know how the panel thinks said that it was unusual, if not unprecedented, for a company to move to the United States to avoid CFIUS scrutiny. But they also said that the strategy could work. “Broadcom could very well establish its position as a U.S. person,” one expert said privately to protect business relationships. “Would CFIUS want to look at it? They would want to be comfortable that Broadcom is actually a U.S. person within the meaning of the statute.” Others cautioned that CFIUS could also look at the make-up of Broadcom’s board and who the major shareholders are as a way to determine if control of the company resides outside the United States.

1097,QCOM,U.S. panel says concerns over Broadcom deal warrant full investigation -Treasury,"March 6 (Reuters) - A U.S. government security panel has identified potential security concerns that warrant a full investigation of Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd’s $117 billion bid for chipmaker Qualcomm Inc, a senior U.S. Treasury official said in a letter to the companies on Monday. Some of the concerns relate to risks associated with Broadcom's relationships with third party foreign entities, Aimen N. Mir, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Investment Security said in the letter, dated March 5 and released by Qualcomm on Tuesday. (bit.ly/2FtCesY) He said the bulk of the concerns identified by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which on Sunday asked for time to examine the deal, were classified. A source familiar with CFIUS’ thinking told Reuters on Monday that if the deal was completed, the U.S. military was concerned that within 10 years, “there would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that’s essentially Huawei.” (Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru)",3062018,http://www.reuters.com/article/qualcomm-ma-broadcom/u-s-panel-says-concerns-over-broadcom-deal-warrant-full-investigation-treasury-idUSL4N1QO4FF
1098,QCOM,RPT-Qualcomm takeover battle intervention shows U.S. security panel's expanding reach,"(Repeats story first published on March 5, no change to text) By Greg Roumeliotis March 5 (Reuters) - A U.S. national security panel’s unusual decision to review Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd’s $117 billion hostile bid for smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm Ltd illustrates an expanding focus on the competitiveness of the U.S. semiconductor industry amid advances by China, regulatory experts said. The secretive panel, called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), has scuppered several attempts by Chinese technology companies to acquire U.S. chipmakers in the last 12 months over concerns about the transfer of potentially sensitive technology. Broadcom is not a Chinese company, and has pledged to move its domicile from Singapore to the United States, arguing this will makes its acquisition of Qualcomm not covered by CFIUS. However, many of Qualcomm’s rivals, including Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, are Chinese. Huawei is forging closer commercial ties with big telecommunication operators across Asia, the Americas and Europe, putting the company in prime position to lead the global race for wireless 5G networks, despite U.S. allegations it poses a security threat. CFIUS views Qualcomm as a prized U.S. asset in the development of 5G wireless technology, which allows for the transmission of data at very fast speeds. It wants to make sure Qualcomm does not lose its status as a dominant player in wireless chip technology, according to a source familiar with the panel’s thinking. As a result, Broadcom’s business plan for Qualcomm, including any divestitures it plans in order to appease antitrust regulators, will be scrutinized by CFIUS, lawyers who advised companies on their CFIUS applications said. “This shows how indirect exposure to China is a frequent, but under-noticed, source of perceived national security risk,” said Mario Mancuso, a former CFIUS member who is now a partner at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP. CFIUS’ stance has toughened as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to pressure China to help tackle North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and be more accommodative on trade and foreign exchange issues. Unfilled political vacancies in several government departments and agencies have also made it harder for CFIUS to approve deals. Canyon Bridge Capital Partners LLC, a U.S.-based private equity firm funded by the Chinese government, saw its $1.3 billion acquisition of U.S. chipmaker Lattice Semiconductor Corp collapse last year after it was blocked by CFIUS, a rejection subsequently upheld by Trump. Last month, U.S. semiconductor testing company Xcerra Corp said CFIUS had blocked its $580 million sale to a Chinese state-backed semiconductor investment fund. Reuters reported last week that CFIUS had begun looking at Broadcom’s bid as pressure grew from politicians, including senior Republican U.S. Senator John Cornyn. “Qualcomm is a leader in 5G technology, which is going to be the new standard in the future. And, as we’ve seen, some of our international rivals, like China, have been incredibly aggressive and strategic,” Cornyn said on Monday. He has proposed legislation to tighten CFIUS’ scrutiny of deals. CFIUS’ intervention was unusual in that the panel typically reviews signed deals. However, Qualcomm has been resisting Broadcom’s overtures, prompting the latter to nominate six directors to Qualcomm’s 11-member board at its shareholder meeting. CFIUS on Sunday ordered Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, which was scheduled for Tuesday, for a month. Qualcomm filed a voluntary request for CFIUS to review Broadcom’s bid on Jan. 29. CFIUS rules allow a company facing an unsolicited takeover bid to request a CFIUS review, so that its board of directors can better assess the regulatory risk of a deal. “The rules say that one party alone could approach CFIUS and for a review,” said McDermott Will & Emery LLP regulatory lawyer David Levine. Such circumstances are few and far between. Miner Rio Tinto Plc asked CFIUS for a review in 2008 after facing a hostile  $150 billion bid by BHP Billiton Ltd, according to a source familiar with the matter. CFIUS allowed the bid, but BHP subsequently walked away from the deal in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Broadcom struggled to win CFIUS approval to buy Brocade Communications Systems late last year. In the end, that approval came just weeks after Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan announced in an Oval Office ceremony with Trump that Broadcom would bring its headquarters to the United States.

1099,QCOM,Broadcom bid for Qualcomm: The saga so far,"(Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) sought again to soothe U.S. security concerns around its bid for chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) on Wednesday, saying it would stick with investments aimed at maintaining the United States’ leadership in 5G technology. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a national security panel that can stop mergers that could harm U.S. security, in an unusual move, stepped into Singapore-based Broadcom’s hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm this week, citing a number of concerns on the development of the next generation of mobile networks and technology. CFIUS delayed a shareholder meeting that had threatened to hand Broadcom control of the Qualcomm board and, among other things, said lower R&D; spending would weaken U.S.-based Qualcomm against Chinese companies. Here are the important events that have taken place since Broadcom made its first bid to buy Qualcomm: March 6, 2018 CFIUS identified potential risks that warrant a full investigation of Broadcom’s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm, a senior U.S. Treasury official said in a letter to the companies. Some of the U.S. government’s concerns relate to risks associated with Broadcom’s relationships with foreign entities, Aimen Mir, the Treasury’s deputy assistant secretary for investment security, said in the letter, without identifying who those parties might be. The letter, dated March 5, was made public by Qualcomm on Tuesday. Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm is in talks to settle a patent dispute with China’s Huawei Technologies Co HWT.UL and could reach an agreement in the coming weeks, citing people familiar with the matter.  March 5, 2018 Broadcom said the decision by CFIUS to review the deal was the result of secret moves made by Qualcomm on Jan. 29 to encourage an investigation into the offer. Qualcomm said in a statement that it was delaying its 2018 annual meeting to April 5 as a result of the CFIUS order. Separately, Qualcomm, which is awaiting China’s MOFCOM approval for the $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O), extended the tender offer to March 9 from March 5. March 4, 2018 The U.S. government ordered the national security review of Broadcom Ltd’s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm that prompted Qualcomm to delay its March 6 shareholder meeting. March 2, 2018 Broadcom, seeking to buy rival Qualcomm, was planning to complete its move back to the United States by mid-May, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Wrapping up the move from Singapore and redomiciling in the United States relatively quickly could remove a roadblock to Broadcom’s proposed deal by calming concerns at the national security panel, CFIUS. Feb. 27, 2018 CFIUS began looking at Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom’s plan to take over rival Qualcomm, Reuters reported, citing three sources familiar with the matter.         Feb. 26, 2018 Qualcomm appears to warm to Broadcom’s advances by saying the sides have grown closer on regulatory issues and called for talks on price after Broadcom’s latest $117 billion offer. The war of words continued, however, as Broadcom called its U.S. semiconductor peer’s proposal to negotiate a higher price “engagement theater”.     Feb. 21, 2018 Broadcom cut its bid for Qualcomm by $3 to $79 per share after Qualcomm raises its offer for NXP Semiconductors. Feb. 20, 2018 Qualcomm deals a blow to Broadcom’s raised bid by increasing its offer for NXP Semiconductors to $127.50 per share in cash from $110. Feb. 14, 2018 Representatives of Broadcom and Qualcomm meet for the first time to discuss a potential combination; Qualcomm later calls the meeting “constructive”. Feb. 13, 2018 Broadcom scales back its challenge to Qualcomm’s board by cutting the number of board seats it was trying to win to six from 11, following a meeting with proxy advisory firm ISS. Feb. 8, 2018 Qualcomm rejects Broadcom’s revised buyout offer of $121 bln, but proposes meeting to address the bid’s “serious deficiencies in value and certainty”. Feb. 5, 2018 Broadcom raises its offer for Qualcomm to $82 per share from $70 per share, calling the bid its “best and final offer”. The revised offer is contingent on either Qualcomm acquiring NXP Semiconductors for $38 billion or the NXP deal being terminated.

1102,QCOM,U.S. sees national security risk from Broadcom's Qualcomm deal,"(Reuters) - A U.S. government national security panel has identified potential risks that warrant a full investigation of Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd’s (AVGO.O) $117 billion bid for chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), a senior U.S. Treasury official said in a letter to the companies on Monday. Shares of Qualcomm slid 3 percent on growing investor concern that such government scrutiny, unusual for a deal that has not yet been agreed, would scupper any takeover by Broadcom.  Some of the U.S. government’s concerns relate to risks associated with Broadcom’s relationships with foreign entities, Aimen Mir, the Treasury’s deputy assistant secretary for investment security, said in the letter, without identifying who those parties might be. The letter, dated March 5, was made public by Qualcomm on Tuesday. (bit.ly/2FtCesY) The U.S. government’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ordered a national security review of Broadcom’s proposed deal on Sunday in an unusual move that prompted Qualcomm to delay a March 6 shareholder meeting. The letter said that, as with every investigation, the review will consider the potential risk of an unnamed “actor” working through Broadcom to hurt U.S. national security, adding that the bulk of CFIUS’ concerns were classified. CFIUS, made up of representatives from the Departments of Defense, State, Justice, Treasury, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security, assesses proposed foreign deals to purchase U.S. assets to ensure they do not harm national security. The inter-agency body, led by the Treasury, rarely looks at mergers before companies have clinched an agreement, highlighting the urgency of U.S. concerns about safeguarding semiconductor technology. The review of the Broadcom deal illustrates the U.S. government’s expanding focus on the competitiveness of the national semiconductor industry as China advances, regulatory experts said.          The U.S. government is concerned that Chinese companies, including the big network equipment and mobile phone maker Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], will take advantage of any openings to take the lead in the next generation mobile phone networks known as 5G. “A shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative security consequences for the United States,” Mir’s letter said. Broadcom said in a statement it was cooperating with CFIUS. “There can be no question that an American Broadcom-Qualcomm combination will provide far more resources for investments and development to that end.” Broadcom said last year it plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore.  A source familiar with CFIUS’ thinking told Reuters on Monday that if Broadcom acquired Qualcomm, the U.S. military had concerns that within 10 years “there would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that’s essentially Huawei.” Huawei has been forging closer commercial ties with big telecom operators across Europe and Asia, putting the company in prime position to lead the global race for 5G networks despite U.S. concerns. Its has a dominant position in China, which is set to become the world’s biggest 5G market by far, but has also made inroads in the rest of world to compete with rivals such as Ericsson and Nokia in several lucrative markets, including countries that are longstanding U.S. allies.

1108,QCOM,"Broadcom promises on security, Qualcomm revamps board","(Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) has promised not to sell critical national security assets to foreign buyers if its deal to buy chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) is approved, another effort by the Singapore-based firm to appease U.S. security concerns. Separately, Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) said it discontinued the role of executive chairman and named a new non-executive chairman as it seeks to curry favor with shareholders ahead of a proxy fight with Broadcom now slated for April 5. Qualcomm also said Tom Horton would continue as its lead director. Horton has been a member of the company’s board since December 2008, having previously served as chairman and chief executive officer of American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O). Broadcom’s $117 billion bid for Qualcomm has warped into a complex fight over regulatory approvals, security nerves about China’s influence on global mobile networks and the best way forward financially for one of the world’s dominant chipmakers. In an open letter to the U.S. Congress on Friday, Broadcom promised to invest $3 billion in research and engineering and $6 billion in manufacturing in the United States annually. It did not say how those numbers compared with current spending by the two companies. Broadcom spent about $3.3 billion in 2017 on research and development and $2.7 billion in 2016, while Qualcomm’s R&D; investment was significantly higher with about $5.5 billion in 2017 and $5.2 billion in the year before that. Qualcomm’s annual shareholder meeting, now slated for April 5, was postponed by 30 days after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) this week ordered a national security review of the takeover. The U.S. government has raised concerns that Chinese companies, including the big network equipment and mobile phone maker Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], will take advantage of any openings to take the lead in the next generation mobile phone networks known as 5G. “Broadcom will not sell any critical national security assets to any foreign companies,” the letter said. “Of course, any dispositions of assets to foreign buyers would be themselves subject to CFIUS review.” ",3092018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom/broadcom-promises-on-security-qualcomm-revamps-board-idUSKCN1GL1N0

1117,QCOM,"Dow, S&P; weighed down by tariffs while tech boosts Nasdaq","NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P; 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped on Monday as the U.S. tariffs signed into law last week by President Donald Trump weighed on industrials, though gains in tech stocks boosted the Nasdaq. Shares of companies such as Boeing Co (BA.N), down 2.9 percent, and Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), down 2.4 percent, have been under pressure as Trump’s protectionist stance on steel and aluminum imports could increase costs and hamper sales abroad. Boeing and Caterpillar were the biggest decliners on the Dow. Trump last week softened his stance on tariffs by exempting Canada and Mexico, and negotiations were ongoing as the European Union and Japan also seek exemptions. “The big multinational, industrial companies of the world are all taking a hit on the concern that they will be the targets of reprisal sanctions,” said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin. Concerns about possible fallout from the tariffs largely supplanted optimism, based upon the modest wage growth numbers from Friday’s employment report, that the Federal Reserve would stick to its projected three interest-rate increases in 2018. Still, those numbers indicate a positive outlook for stocks despite today’s losses, said Anwiti Bahuguna, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle in Boston. “We’ve seen stable, modest wage growth, nothing that should be considered harmful for equity markets,” she said. “Growth stocks are doing well. It’s pretty much a continuation of last year’s rally, whereas the Dow has all sorts of other companies that may not be growth-oriented.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 157.13 points, or 0.62 percent, to 25,178.61, the S&P; 500 .SPX lost 3.55 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,783.02 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 27.52 points, or 0.36 percent, to 7,588.33. Even with the session's losses, the S&P; 500 is just 3.1 percent below record highs hit on Jan. 26, while the Nasdaq .IXIC has recovered its losses from last month's sell-off. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was lifted in part by further signs of official disapproval of Broadcom Ltd’s (AVGO.O) $117 billion bid for U.S. graphics chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O).  The U.S. Treasury said in a letter to Singapore-based Broadcom that it had confirmed national security concerns about the bid and that the company had not given sufficient notice of its plans to redomicile in the United States.  Broadcom gained 3.6 percent while shares in Qualcomm were flat.  Shares of Micron Technology (MU.O) rose 8.8 percent to $59.37 after analysts at Nomura raised their target for the stock to $100.  Oclaro (OCLR.O) jumped 27.5 percent after laser and optical fiber specialist Lumentum Holdings (LITE.O) said it would buy the optical components producer for $1.7 billion. Lumentum’s shares rose 4.4 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P; 500 posted 61 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 211 new highs and 24 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.52 billion shares, compared to the 7.2 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Broadcom’s $117 billion offer to buy California-based Qualcomm is being reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) for potential national security threats.

1122,QCOM,Trump makes investment banking fees uncertain again,"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s dramatic intervention in Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd’s (AVGO.O) $117 billion hostile bid for U.S. semiconductor peer Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) is the latest reminder to investment bankers not to take lucrative fees on transformative mergers for granted under his administration. Seven investment banks that were backing Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm, the largest acquisition ever attempted in the technology sector, stand to lose out on fees as a result of Trump’s order on Monday prohibiting the deal due to national security concerns. “Bankers will be skeptical about cross-border deals that involve technology or data that could have implications for national security or for America’s competitive position in key industries,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. Broadcom has disclosed its financial advisers as Moelis & Co M.S, Citigroup (C.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp BAML.N, Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N). They stood to receive an estimated $135 million if the deal had gone ahead, according to Freeman Consulting Services.  This is not the first time Trump’s administration has put investment banking fees in jeopardy. The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop AT&T; Inc (T.N), from buying HBO and CNN owner Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) for $85 billion, citing antitrust concerns. If that deal closes, AT&T;’s adviser, Perella Weinberg Partners, will receive an estimated $80 million, Freeman said, while Time Warner’s advisers, Allen & Co, Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), will receive $140 million, according to regulatory filings. To be sure, the Trump administration’s overall track record is not hostile to mergers. Deal activity continues to be robust, with U.S. merger and acquisition volumes reaching $389 billion so far this year, compared with $236.5 billion in the same period a year ago, as companies have been emboldened by U.S. tax reform to pursue big deals.  What is more, banks typically do receive some small portion of the full fees if deals fall through. In the case of Broadcom, the banks could now receive an estimated $20 million, according to Freeman.  However, the high-profile dealmaking casualties illustrate how Trump’s pro-business rhetoric has not always translated into smooth sailing for the regulatory approval of deals.    Investment bankers’ nerves are about to be tested further, as more transformative deals make their way through the regulatory review process. Walt Disney Co’s (DIS.N) $52.4 billion acquisition of assets from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O), CVS Health Corp’s (CVS.N) $69 billion deal to buy health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) and U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp’s (CI.N) $52 billion agreement to buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O) will be subjected to intense regulatory scrutiny later this year.

1124,QCOM,President Trump halts Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday blocked microchip maker Broadcom Ltd’s(AVGO.O) proposed takeover of Qualcomm Inc(QCOM.O) on national security grounds, ending what would have been the technology industry’s biggest deal ever amid concerns that it would give China the upper hand in mobile communications. The presidential order reflected a calculation that the United States’ lead in creating technology and setting standards for the next generation of mobile cell phone communications would be lost to China if Singapore-based Broadcom took over San Diego-based Qualcomm, according to a White House official. Qualcomm has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to China’s Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] in the sector, making Qualcomm a prized asset.  Qualcomm had earlier rebuffed Broadcom’s $117 billion bid, which was under investigation by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a multi-agency panel led by the Treasury Department that reviews the national security implications of acquisitions of U.S. corporations by foreign companies. In a letter on March 5, CFIUS said it was investigating whether Broadcom would starve Qualcomm of research dollars that would allow it to compete and also cited the risk of Broadcom’s relationship with “third party foreign entities.” While it did not identify those entities, the letter repeatedly described Qualcomm as the leading company in so-called 5G technology development and standard setting. “A shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States,” CFIUS said. “While the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover.” A White House official on Monday confirmed that the national security concerns related to the risks of Broadcom’s relationship with third party foreign entities. A source familiar with CFIUS’ thinking had said that, if the deal was completed, the U.S. military was concerned that within 10 years, “there would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that’s essentially Huawei, and then the American carriers would have no choice. They would just have to buy Huawei (equipment).” Huawei has been forging closer commercial ties with big telecom operators across Europe and Asia, putting it in prime position to lead the global race for 5G networks despite U.S. concerns. Huawei has a dominant position in China, which is set to become the world’s biggest 5G market by far, and has also made inroads in the rest of world to compete with rivals such as Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and Nokia (NOKIA.HE) in several lucrative markets, including countries that are longstanding U.S. allies. Qualcomm is also a major player in 5G, estimated to have 15 percent of 5G-essential patents in the world, compared with 11 percent for Nokia and 10 percent for all of China, according to a Jefferies report citing LexInnova research. Many smartphone makers are counting on Qualcomm to deliver its 5G chipset on time in late 2018 to roll out their 5G phones in 2019. Shares of Broadcom rose less than 1.0 percent to $264.10 in after-hours trade while Qualcomm fell 4.3 percent to $60.14. Broadcom said it was reviewing the presidential order. “Broadcom strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns,” it said in a statement in response to the decision.  Qualcomm, which had delayed its annual shareholder meeting during the CFIUS review, set the new date for March 23. The move by Trump to kill the deal comes only months after the U.S. president himself stood next to Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan at the White House, announcing the company’s decision to move its headquarters to the United States and calling it “one of the really great, great companies.”  This is the fifth time a U.S. president has blocked a deal based on CFIUS objections and the second deal Trump has stopped since assuming office slightly over a year ago.  “The proposed takeover of Qualcomm by the Purchaser (Broadcom) is prohibited, and any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover, whether effected directly or indirectly, is also prohibited,” the presidential order released on Monday said. The order cited “credible evidence” that led Trump to believe that Broadcom’s taking control of Qualcomm “might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.” Broadcom had struggled to complete its proposed deal to buy Qualcomm, which had cited several concerns including the price offered and potential antitrust hurdles. The presidential decision to block the deal cannot be appealed. However, it is not clear what rules Broadcom would have to follow if it goes ahead with announced plans to move its headquarters to the United States. Companies may challenge CFIUS’s jurisdiction in court but may not challenge the inter-agency panel’s national security findings, a CFIUS expert said. If Broadcom decides to press on with its effort to buy Qualcomm, it would be wise to drop the matter for now while the company quietly wraps up its move to the United States, a second CFIUS expert said.

1125,QCOM,UPDATE 9-President Trump halts Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday blocked microchip maker Broadcom Ltd’s(AVGO.O) proposed takeover of Qualcomm Inc(QCOM.O) on national security grounds, ending what would have been the technology industry’s biggest deal ever amid concerns that it would give China the upper hand in mobile communications. The presidential order reflected a calculation that the United States’ lead in creating technology and setting standards for the next generation of mobile cell phone communications would be lost to China if Singapore-based Broadcom took over San Diego-based Qualcomm, according to a White House official. Qualcomm has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to China’s Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] in the sector, making Qualcomm a prized asset.  Qualcomm had earlier rebuffed Broadcom’s $117 billion bid, which was under investigation by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a multi-agency panel led by the Treasury Department that reviews the national security implications of acquisitions of U.S. corporations by foreign companies. In a letter on March 5, CFIUS said it was investigating whether Broadcom would starve Qualcomm of research dollars that would allow it to compete and also cited the risk of Broadcom’s relationship with “third party foreign entities.” While it did not identify those entities, the letter repeatedly described Qualcomm as the leading company in so-called 5G technology development and standard setting. “A shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States,” CFIUS said. “While the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover.” A White House official on Monday confirmed that the national security concerns related to the risks of Broadcom’s relationship with third party foreign entities. A source familiar with CFIUS’ thinking had said that, if the deal was completed, the U.S. military was concerned that within 10 years, “there would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that’s essentially Huawei, and then the American carriers would have no choice. They would just have to buy Huawei (equipment).” Huawei has been forging closer commercial ties with big telecom operators across Europe and Asia, putting it in prime position to lead the global race for 5G networks despite U.S. concerns. Huawei has a dominant position in China, which is set to become the world’s biggest 5G market by far, and has also made inroads in the rest of world to compete with rivals such as Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and Nokia (NOKIA.HE) in several lucrative markets, including countries that are longstanding U.S. allies. Qualcomm is also a major player in 5G, estimated to have 15 percent of 5G-essential patents in the world, compared with 11 percent for Nokia and 10 percent for all of China, according to a Jefferies report citing LexInnova research. Many smartphone makers are counting on Qualcomm to deliver its 5G chipset on time in late 2018 to roll out their 5G phones in 2019. Shares of Broadcom rose less than 1.0 percent to $264.10 in after-hours trade while Qualcomm fell 4.3 percent to $60.14. Broadcom said it was reviewing the presidential order. “Broadcom strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns,” it said in a statement in response to the decision.  Qualcomm, which had delayed its annual shareholder meeting during the CFIUS review, set the new date for March 23.

1127,QCOM,Broadcom ends bid for Qualcomm after President Trump nixes deal,"(Reuters) - Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd withdrew its $117 billion bid to acquire Qualcomm Inc on Wednesday, two days after U.S. President Donald Trump blocked the attempt citing national security concerns. The company said it has also withdrawn its slate of independent director nominees for Qualcomm’s annual shareholder meeting. Broadcom, however, expects to continue with its plan to redomicile to the United States. “Although we are disappointed with this outcome, Broadcom will comply with the order,” the chipmaker said. Sources had told Reuters on Tuesday that Broadcom was ready to scrap its bid for Qualcomm. Broadcom’s board met late on Tuesday to formalize plans to move its base to the United States, at a cost of about $500 million a year under a higher tax rate, the sources said. Being based in the United States as opposed to Singapore should make it easier for Broadcom to make acquisitions of U.S. companies without falling under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Shares of Broadcom were untraded, while those of Qualcomm were up marginally before the opening bell.

1128,QCOM,Timeline: Broadcom-Qualcomm saga comes to an abrupt end,"(Reuters) - Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd withdrew its $117 billion bid to acquire Qualcomm Inc on Wednesday, two days after U.S. President Donald Trump blocked the attempt, citing national security concerns. The company said it has also withdrawn its slate of independent director nominees for Qualcomm’s annual shareholder meeting. Broadcom expects to continue with its plan to redomicile to the United States. Here are the important developments that have taken place since Broadcom made its first bid to buy Qualcomm: March 13 - A dozen banks that signed on to provide a record $100 billion bridge loan to back Broadcom’s planned $117 billion takeover of Qualcomm will earn starkly less than planned for extending credit to the chipmaker after President Trump blocked the deal over national security concerns. - Senator Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate, praised Trump’s decision, calling China’s trade practices “rapacious.” - Broadcom, led by dynamic Chief Executive Hock Tan, is unlikely to put the brakes on an acquisition spree after its $117 billion bid for Qualcomm Inc was blocked by President Trump on national security grounds. That was the immediate reaction from Wall Street’s tech sector analysts to Trump’s surprise intervention to block what would have been the biggest ever tech merger. March 12 - President Trump signed an order to halt the deal on concerns that a takeover of Qualcomm by the Singapore-based company would erode the United States’ lead in mobile technology and give China the upper hand. - Broadcom violated an order from a national security panel in a bid to push for a merger with Qualcomm, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a letter. The letter said that Broadcom “took a series of actions in violation” of a previous order from Treasury. - Broadcom said it expects to redomicile to the United States by April 3. March 9 - Microchip maker Intel Corp responded to a news report that it is considering a possible bid for Broadcom by saying that it is focused on integrating previous acquisitions, raising doubt over the idea. The Wall Street Journal reported that Intel’s competitive concern about Broadcom’s attempt to buy Qualcomm had led it to consider a range of acquisitions in response, including a bid for Broadcom. - A U.S. national security panel ordered Broadcom to provide it with five business days’ notice before taking any action toward redomiciling to the United States, a regulatory filing revealed. The previously undisclosed requirement shows that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies for potential national security risks, is aware that its jurisdiction could be contested if Broadcom redomiciles to the United States. - Broadcom promised not to sell critical national security assets to foreign buyers if its deal for Qualcomm is approved, another effort by the firm to appease U.S. security concerns. Separately, Qualcomm said it discontinued the role of executive chairman and named a new non-executive chairman. March 7 Broadcom sought again to soothe U.S. security concerns around its bid for Qualcomm, saying it would stick with investments aimed at maintaining the United States’ leadership in 5G technology. CFIUS, in an unusual move, stepped into Broadcom’s hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm this week, citing a number of concerns on the development of the next generation of mobile networks and technology. March 6 CFIUS identified potential risks that warrant a full investigation of Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm, a senior U.S. Treasury official said in a letter to the companies. Some of the U.S. government’s concerns relate to risks associated with Broadcom’s relationships with foreign entities, Aimen Mir, the Treasury’s deputy assistant secretary for investment security, said in the letter, without identifying who those parties might be. The letter was dated March 5 and made public by Qualcomm. Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported that Qualcomm is in talks to settle a patent dispute with China’s Huawei Technologies Co and could reach an agreement in the coming weeks, citing people familiar with the matter.  March 5 Broadcom said the decision by CFIUS to review the deal was the result of secret moves made by Qualcomm on Jan. 29 to encourage an investigation into the offer. Qualcomm said it was delaying its 2018 annual meeting to April 5 as a result of the CFIUS order. Separately, Qualcomm, which is awaiting China’s MOFCOM approval for the $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors NV, extended the tender offer to March 9 from March 5. March 4 The U.S. government ordered the national security review of Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm that prompted Qualcomm to delay its March 6 shareholder meeting. March 2 Broadcom was planning to complete its move back to the United States by mid-May, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Wrapping up the move from Singapore and redomiciling in the United States relatively quickly could remove a roadblock to Broadcom’s proposed deal by calming concerns at the national security panel, CFIUS. Feb. 27 CFIUS began looking at Broadcom’s plan to take over Qualcomm, Reuters reported, citing three sources familiar with the matter.         Feb. 26 Qualcomm appears to warm to Broadcom’s advances by saying the sides have grown closer on regulatory issues and called for talks on price after Broadcom’s latest $117 billion offer. The war of words continued, however, as Broadcom called its U.S. semiconductor peer’s proposal to negotiate a higher price “engagement theater”.     Feb. 21 Broadcom cut its bid for Qualcomm by $3 to $79 per share after Qualcomm raises its offer for NXP Semiconductors. Feb. 20 Qualcomm deals a blow to Broadcom’s raised bid by increasing its offer for NXP Semiconductors to $127.50 per share in cash from $110. Feb. 14 Representatives of Broadcom and Qualcomm meet for the first time to discuss a potential combination; Qualcomm later calls the meeting “constructive”. Feb. 13 Broadcom scales back its challenge to Qualcomm’s board by cutting the number of board seats it was trying to win to six from 11, following a meeting with proxy advisory firm ISS. Feb. 8 Qualcomm rejects Broadcom’s revised buyout offer of $121 bln, but proposes meeting to address the bid’s “serious deficiencies in value and certainty”. Feb. 5 Broadcom raises its offer for Qualcomm to $82 per share from $70 per share, calling the bid its “best and final offer”. The revised offer is contingent on either Qualcomm acquiring NXP Semiconductors for $38 billion or the NXP deal being terminated. Jan. 17 The Federal Trade Commission investigates whether Broadcom engaged in anticompetitive tactics in negotiations with customers, casting further doubts on regulatory approval for potential deals. Dec. 22, 2017 Qualcomm rejects Broadcom and private equity firm Silver Lake Partners’ 11 director nominees, setting the stage for a proxy battle.

Also helping the sentiment was a faster-than-expected growth in China’s factory activity in the first two months of the year, which boosted commodity prices and oil prices. China strong growth comes at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports. “China came out with a better news than what was expected,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth. “The market is still trying to weigh concerns about tariffs on one hand and understanding how the President acts and how he speaks openly and comes up with a different policy in the end.” The S&P; 500 and the Dow closed 0.6 percent lower on Tuesday after Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and appointed CIA Director Mike Pompeo as replacement. Market sentiment took a hit early last week after the President announced plan to levy tariffs on steel and aluminum import. Retail sales fell for a third straight month in February as households cut back on purchases of motor vehicles and other big-ticket items. Another set showed U.S. producer prices increased slightly more than expected in February, but a gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services rose 0.4 percent last month, matching January’s gain. The reports follow Tuesday’s consumer prices data that pointed to annual U.S. core inflation steady at 1.8 percent, cementing investors expectations that the Federal Reserve would not raise rates more than three times in 2018. “I’m not thinking that positive futures will end up in a positive day,” said Pavlik.

1133,QCOM,"Broadcom to end bid for Qualcomm, keeps plan to move to U.S.: sources","(Reuters) - Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) is planning to scrap its bid for Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), after U.S. President Donald Trump blocked the chipmaker’s proposed acquisition on national security grounds earlier this week, although it will press on with its plan to move its base to the United States, according to sources familiar with the matter. Broadcom’s board was meeting on Tuesday night to formalize its plans and it could make an announcement as soon as Wednesday, the two sources added. The company will also drop its challenge to Qualcomm’s board, the people added. Broadcom will continue with its plan to redomicile to the United States, a move that will cost it about $500 million a year under a higher tax rate, the sources added.  Being based in the United States as opposed to Singapore will allow Broadcom to make what it believes will be acquisitions of U.S. companies that will not fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns. Broadcom and Qualcomm could not be immediately reached for comment. Trump signed an order late on Monday to halt what would have been the biggest-ever technology deal on concerns that a takeover of Qualcomm by the Singapore-based company would erode the United States’ lead in mobile technology and give China the upper hand. The deal, spearheaded by CEO Hock Tan, would have created the world’s No. 3 semiconductor company with a leading market share in smartphones, car electronics and industrial internet devices.  Analysts said Broadcom can still build heft through smaller deals. And it could have an easier time buying U.S. targets if it goes through with plans to redomicilie in the United States.  Tan has already turned Avago, a small chipmaker with a market value of $3.5 billion in 2009, into a more than $100 billion company.  Tan bought California-based companies Broadcom for $37 billion in a leveraged deal in 2015 and Brocade Communications in a $5.5 billion deal two years later.  San Diego-based Qualcomm evolved from a U.S. military aerospace contractor to become the dominant player in wireless radio technology over the past two decades, with its chips used in half of all smartphones.  It fended off antitrust concerns around the globe over its intellectual property strategies, taking the biggest share of wireless royalties in the 3G and 4G eras and getting a head start on next decade’s 5G era, which promises to embed wireless connections in cars, factories, homes and cities.  Broadcom now has ample firepower for smaller deals, with about $11 billion in cash and the potential to generate nearly $9 billion in annual free cash flow, analysts estimate.  CFIUS, which raised concerns about the Qualcomm deal with Trump, listed the highly leveraged nature of Broadcom’s bid for its larger rival as a major concern coupled with the risk of the U.S. losing mobile technology leadership.   Broadcom had planned since last year to relocate its legal headquarters to the United States, avoiding the need for a CFIUS review. “If Broadcom completes its redomiciling in the U.S. in a way that extinguishes any non-U.S. ownership or control, then I think they can open the door to many, if not all, acquisitions ... they would effectively no longer be subject to a CFIUS-initiated review or investigation,” said Guillermo Christensen, a lawyer who works on CFIUS issues at Brown Rudnick in Washington. “But that really hinges on completely severing the foreign ownership connection,” he said.

1134,QCOM,"UPDATE 3-Broadcom to end bid for Qualcomm, keeps plan to move to U.S. -sources","(Reuters) - Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) is planning to scrap its bid for Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), after U.S. President Donald Trump blocked the chipmaker’s proposed acquisition on national security grounds earlier this week, although it will press on with its plan to move its base to the United States, according to sources familiar with the matter. Broadcom’s board was meeting on Tuesday night to formalize its plans and it could make an announcement as soon as Wednesday, the two sources added. The company will also drop its challenge to Qualcomm’s board, the people added. Broadcom will continue with its plan to redomicile to the United States, a move that will cost it about $500 million a year under a higher tax rate, the sources added.  Being based in the United States as opposed to Singapore will allow Broadcom to make what it believes will be acquisitions of U.S. companies that will not fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals for potential national security concerns. Broadcom and Qualcomm could not be immediately reached for comment. Trump signed an order late on Monday to halt what would have been the biggest-ever technology deal on concerns that a takeover of Qualcomm by the Singapore-based company would erode the United States’ lead in mobile technology and give China the upper hand. The deal, spearheaded by CEO Hock Tan, would have created the world’s No. 3 semiconductor company with a leading market share in smartphones, car electronics and industrial internet devices.  Analysts said Broadcom can still build heft through smaller deals. And it could have an easier time buying U.S. targets if it goes through with plans to redomicilie in the United States.  Tan has already turned Avago, a small chipmaker with a market value of $3.5 billion in 2009, into a more than $100 billion company.  Tan bought California-based companies Broadcom for $37 billion in a leveraged deal in 2015 and Brocade Communications in a $5.5 billion deal two years later.  San Diego-based Qualcomm evolved from a U.S. military aerospace contractor to become the dominant player in wireless radio technology over the past two decades, with its chips used in half of all smartphones.  It fended off antitrust concerns around the globe over its intellectual property strategies, taking the biggest share of wireless royalties in the 3G and 4G eras and getting a head start on next decade’s 5G era, which promises to embed wireless connections in cars, factories, homes and cities.  Broadcom now has ample firepower for smaller deals, with about $11 billion in cash and the potential to generate nearly $9 billion in annual free cash flow, analysts estimate.  CFIUS, which raised concerns about the Qualcomm deal with Trump, listed the highly leveraged nature of Broadcom’s bid for its larger rival as a major concern coupled with the risk of the U.S. losing mobile technology leadership.

1135,QCOM,UPDATE 1-Former Qualcomm chairman explores long-shot bid for U.S. chip maker -sources,"(Reuters) - Former Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) Chairman Paul Jacobs has informed its board of directors that he will seek to partner with investment firms to make an offer for the U.S. semiconductor company, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Jacobs’ attempt to put together an offer comes just a few days after Qualcomm fended off a $117 billion hostile bid from Singapore-based rival Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) thanks to an order by U.S. President Donald Trump prohibiting the deal due to national security concerns.  Qualcomm does not view Jacobs’ attempt to put together a buyout bid as credible, the sources said. Jacobs has held talks with several investment firms, including SoftBank Group Corp’s (9984.T) Vision Fund, but has so far been unable to secure the necessary financing, the three sources added. Jacobs is attempting to put together the largest leveraged buyout of all time, three times as large as the $45 billion buyout of Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings, which ended in bankruptcy.  Even if SoftBank, a Japanese telecommunications group with technology investments around the world, wanted to join Jacobs’ bid, it could face conflicts given its ownership of British chip designer ARM Holdings Plc, the sources said. Adding to the potential conflicts, Qualcomm is an investor in the Vision Fund. SoftBank’s deals are also subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the U.S. national security panel that also objected to Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Qualcomm declined to comment, while Jacobs and SoftBank could not be immediately reached for comment. The Financial Times first reported on Jacob’s buyout efforts earlier on Thursday. Jacobs, who still sits on Qualcomm’s board, was stripped of his title of executive chairman earlier this month when Jeffrey Henderson, another Qualcomm director, was named non-executive chairman. While Jacobs shared the view of Qualcomm’s board that Broadcom’s bid undervalued the company and was fraught with regulatory risks, many on Qualcomm’s board blamed him for the dissatisfaction of some Qualcomm’s shareholders with the company’s handling of Broadcom’s bid, according to the sources. Jacobs, whose father Irwin co-founded Qualcomm, is up for re-election as board director, alongside other Qualcomm nominees, at the company’s shareholder meeting on March 23. Proxy advisory firm ISS on Wednesday recommended to Qualcomm shareholders that they vote for Broadcom’s four nominees on Qualcomm’s 11-person board, even though their nominations have been withdrawn, as a form of protest. Given that Qualcomm’s board director slate faces no competition, the re-election of Qualcomm’s board directors is assured. However, limited support for Qualcomm’s nominees could put pressure on Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf, who was criticized by some investors for inviting CFIUS to review Broadcom’s bid, to make changes to the company’s strategy.

1136,QCOM,"With Qualcomm behind it, Broadcom looks to smaller deals","(Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) on Thursday said it was likely to pursue smaller acquisitions of chipmakers after its failed hostile takeover bid to acquire rival Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and said that its smart phone chip business would see a drop in demand this quarter from a North American customer and an increase from South Korea. Most analysts believe that the North American customer is Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which made up a fifth of Broadcom revenue last year, and the Korean customer is Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), which is ramping up production of its recently announced Galaxy S9 smart phone.  Broadcom results beat expectations days after U.S. President Donald Trump blocked its $117 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm on national security concerns. The company scrapped the offer on Wednesday. Singapore-based Broadcom, however, said it would continue with its plans to redomicile to the United States, fueling expectations that the company would likely scout for smaller targets. “Qualcomm was clearly a unique and very large acquisition opportunity,” Chief Financial Officer Tom Krause told investors on a conference call. “Given the maturity of the industry, the consolidation it is seeing and our relative size now, our future acquisitions are much more likely to be funded with cash available on our balance sheet and without the need to flex the balance sheet.” Broadcom’s shares were down 1.2 percent at $264.50 in extended trading on Thursday. “Typically, Broadcom has to make acquisitions to drive the earnings,” said Summit Insight Group analyst Kinngai Chan. “If the company is able to make two or three medium-size acquisitions, then I think the stock will move up again.” But Broadcom officials were still publicly smarting over the loss of the Qualcomm deal. Krause said he was “touched” by an Institutional Shareholder Services report Wednesday encouraging Qualcomm shareholders to cast protest ballots for Broadcom’s director nominees. Krause said Broadcom believes that “based on the vote tally as of today, the 11 Qualcomm nominees are only garnering between 15 percent to 16 percent of the outstanding shares, not necessarily something to celebrate on San Diego.” Qualcomm declined to comment on Krause’s comments. Broadcom, whose WiFi chips are found in Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) iPhone and most Android phones, was eyeing Qualcomm’s core baseband chips and license business that would significantly benefit from the rollout of 5G wireless technology. Broadcom said first-quarter smart phone results were driven by an increase in orders from a “North American smartphone customer,” which most analysts believe is Apple Inc (AAPL.O), which released its flagship iPhone X later than normal last year, pushing production into the early part of this year. CEO Hock Tan said that customer’s business was expected to “trend down sharply” in the second quarter, partially offset at Broadcom by more business for a “next-generation flagship [phone] from a large Korean smartphone customer.” Net income attributable to ordinary shares surged to $6.23 billion, or $14.62 per share, in the first quarter ended Feb. 4, from $239 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier.  The company, which announced a quarterly interim dividend of $1.75 per share, said it recorded a gain of $5.79 billion due to the recently enacted U.S. tax law. Excluding items, the company earned $5.12 per share.  Net revenue rose to $5.33 billion from $4.14 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $5.05 per share and revenue of $5.32 billion.

1141,QCOM,What is 5G and who are the major players?,"LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has blocked microchip maker Broadcom Ltd’s (AVGO.O) $117 billion takeover of rival Qualcomm (QCOM.O) amid concerns that it would give China the upper hand in the next generation of mobile communications, or 5G. Below are some facts about 5G and major players. 5G networks, now in the final testing stage, will rely on denser arrays of small antennas and the cloud to offer data speeds up to 50 or 100 times faster than current 4G networks and serve as critical infrastructure for a range of industries. Deals to start building mass-market 5G networks are still largely a year away, but by 2025, 1.2 billion people are set to have access to 5G networks - a third of them in China, according to the global wireless trade group GSMA. Moving to new networks promises to enable new mobile services and even whole new business models, but could pose challenges for countries and industries unprepared to invest in the transition. Unlike the upgrades of cellular standards 2G in the early 1990s, 3G around the millennium and 4G in 2010, 5G standards will deliver not just faster phone and computer data but also help connect up cars, machines, cargo and crop equipment. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets acquisitions of U.S. corporations by foreign companies, said the Broadcom takeover risked weakening Qualcomm, which would boost China over the United States in the 5G race. Acquiring Qualcomm would represent the jewel in the crown of Broadcom’s portfolio of communications chips, which supply wi-fi, power management, video and other features in smartphones alongside Qualcomm’s core baseband chips - radio modems that wirelessly connect phones to networks. The concern is that a takeover by Singapore-based Broadcom could see the firm cut research and development spending by Qualcomm or hive off strategically important parts of the company to other buyers, including in China, U.S. officials and analysts have said. 5G promises to open up the clubby world of telecom equipment by creating openings for a far wider range of players in hardware, software and semiconductors, many of them from Asia, increasing the dependence of Silicon Valley on foreign players. Before the new technology becomes a reality for consumers, two transitions need to take place. Mobile operators have to upgrade their networks with 5G gear made by the likes of Huawei [HWT.UL] and ZTE 0000630.SZ of China, Sweden’s Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and Finland’s Nokia (NOKIA.HE). And phone makers need to make handsets with built-in 5G radios ready to hook up to networks.  Qualcomm (QCOM.O) is the dominant player in smartphone communications chips, making half of all core baseband radio chips in smartphones. It is one of the last big U.S. technology companies with a major role in mobile communications hardware.  Most other baseband chips come from Asia: MediaTek (2454.TW) of Taiwan holds about one quarter of the market, while Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Huawei [HWT.UL] - two big smartphone makers - develop chips for their own devices. Huawei does through a subsidiary known as HiSilicon.   Its dominant position in 5G comes from its mastery of two areas: getting its patents adopted in what are known as standards and then selling the chip designs that work with those standards. The standards are set by a global body to ensure all phones work across different mobile networks, and whoever’s essential patents end up making it into the standard stands to reap huge royalty licensing revenue streams. Qualcomm has landed a number of these foundational patents, which means that both handset makers and telecommunications gear makers will have to pay it licensing fees.  It dominated standards setting in 3G and 4G wireless and looks set to top the list of patent holders heading into the 5G cycle. Huawei, Nokia, Ericsson and others are also vying to amass 5G patents, which has helped spur complex cross-licensing agreements like the deal struck late last year Nokia and Huawei around handsets.

1143,QCOM,Balancing act: Chip giant Qualcomm caught between Washington and Beijing,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), blocked this week from a takeover bid amid national security fears, was already walking a Pacific tightrope: it has government and defense contracts in America, but two-thirds of its revenue comes from China.  U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday halted microchip maker Broadcom Ltd’s (AVGO.O) $117 billion takeover of Qualcomm over concerns it would give China the upper hand in the next generation of mobile communications, forcing the Singapore-based firm to drop its bid.  The move illustrated the awkward position of Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego. In the United States, it has government and defense contracts and is seen as a “trusted” supplier. In China, it has its most lucrative market, thanks to patent licensing fees it receives there from smartphone vendors including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Samsung (005930.KS) and Xiaomi. (GRAPHIC: Broadcom, Qualcomm global footprint - tmsnrt.rs/2FIS93)  On top of that, China, the United States and Europe are racing to develop the next generation of wireless data network, called 5G, for mobile phones and increasingly connected devices. Whoever controls the technology will gain a potential strategic advantage, and the U.S. government does not want to have to rely on Chinese-made gear. The result is a delicate balancing act to navigate trade disputes and political tensions between Beijing and Washington that could irk policymakers and regulators on both sides, hurting business and deals. “We see ourselves as part of the China semiconductor system,” Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm President told Reuters at a Beijing event in January. “It’s very clear that 5G is important to the United States of America. It’s important for China.” Qualcomm is still waiting for Chinese approval of its proposed $44 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O) and trying to mend its relationship with Chinese customers after paying a fine of nearly $1 billion for anti-competitive practices in 2015. The company is helping Chinese firms ZTE and China Mobile develop 5G technology and is involved in China’s 5G standard development trials. It has similar partnerships in the U.S. and Europe. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which vets acquisitions of U.S. corporations by foreign companies, said the Broadcom takeover risked weakening Qualcomm, which would boost China in the 5G race. A Broadcom takeover could see the company cut research and development spending by Qualcomm or sell strategically important parts of the company to other buyers, including those in China, officials and analysts said. As such concerns emerged, Broadcom immediately jumped into action, pledging to invest in Qualcomm’s 5G technology and accelerate its move to the United States. But the plan didn’t go down well with CFIUS. The clash marked a sharp fall from grace for Broadcom, whose chief executive, Hock Tan, Trump welcomed to the White House last year to announce a plan to move its headquarters to the United States. At the time, Trump called it “one of the really great, great companies.”  Led by Tan, a Harvard-educated Malaysian entrepreneur, Broadcom grew largely through acquisitions. Tan is an aggressive dealmaker and built the $100 billion chip giant up from a business worth just $3.5 billion in 2009. Until the Qualcomm bid, its biggest deal had been the $37 billion acquisition of Irvine, California-based Broadcom, where the company, called Avago Technologies at the time, got its current name. Qualcomm executives acknowledge the tricky relationship the firm has in China, especially with local companies like Huawei, which is spearheading China’s 5G push. “Our relationship with Huawei is complex; I don’t know if there’s a good word for it,” Amon said in Beijing in January, adding that the company was a big supplier to Huawei while also being a competitor with Huawei’s semiconductor business. Although Huawei is in a strong position to supply 5G network equipment to carriers in many large markets - with the notable exception of the United States - it still has to license some technologies from Qualcomm, which owns more 5G patents than any other company in the world.  Keeping Chinese relationships on track is key for Qualcomm as domestic smartphone makers like Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi gain prominence and as broader U.S.-China trade tensions rise. Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors, two people who had discussed the issue with the Trump administration told Reuters. “I would imagine relationships that we have in China, and probably the symbiosis of that relationship, it will play a very strong role with the (Chinese) regulators’ view of the future of Qualcomm,” Amon said in January.  And the Broadcom takeover case highlights a growing risk for U.S. companies in China. “It’s an unenviable position because they are pretty dependent on China,” said Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China and North Asia at risk consultancy Control Risks, referring to Qualcomm. “They are an extreme case but as more and more sectors become effectively considered ‘strategic’ from a comprehensive national security perspective, more and more companies are facing this kind of squeeze between the U.S. and China.” (GRAPHIC: Global tech M&A; - tmsnrt.rs/2zjPc9A) ",3152018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-m-a-broadcom-china/balancing-act-chip-giant-qualcomm-caught-between-washington-and-beijing-idUSKCN1GR0M0

And the Broadcom takeover case highlights a growing risk for U.S. companies in China. “It’s an unenviable position because they are pretty dependent on China,” said Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China and North Asia at risk consultancy Control Risks, referring to Qualcomm. “They are an extreme case but as more and more sectors become effectively considered ‘strategic’ from a comprehensive national security perspective, more and more companies are facing this kind of squeeze between the U.S. and China.” (GRAPHIC: Global tech M&A; - tmsnrt.rs/2zjPc9A) ",3152018,http://www.reuters.com/article/qualcomm-ma-broadcom-china/balancing-act-chip-giant-qualcomm-caught-between-washington-and-beijing-idUSL3N1QW4GC
1145,QCOM,Former Qualcomm chairman Jacobs to exit board of directors,"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) on Friday said former executive chairman Paul Jacobs would not be renominated for the U.S. semiconductor company’s board after Jacobs disclosed his intention to pursue a long-shot acquisition of the firm.  Jacobs, the former chief executive of the world’s largest mobile chipmaker and the son of its co-founder, said in a separate statement that it was “unfortunate and disappointing” that his fellow board members were “attempting to remove me from the board at this time.” The board decision comes just days after U.S. President Donald Trump blocked a $117 billion hostile bid from Singapore-based rival Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) to acquire Qualcomm, citing national security concerns.    Jacobs supported Qualcomm’s resistance to Broadcom’s bid, but he increasingly clashed with other members of the San Diego-based company’s board, including Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf, over how Qualcomm defended itself, according to people familiar with the matter. Qualcomm said in a statement that its board of directors met on Friday and decided that Jacobs would not be nominated for re-election at its annual meeting on March 23, and that the board would shrink to 10 members from 11. The company did not give specific reasons for the decision but said it wanted to stay independent and continue with its business plans. Mollenkopf has outlined a plan to cut more than $1 billion in costs and boost profits to more than $7 per share by 2019 by resolving disputes with customers such as Apple (AAPL.O). In his statement, Jacobs said he believed that Qualcomm could strengthen itself in the global chip business by going private. “There are clear merits to exploring a path to take the company private in order to maximize the company’s long-term performance, deliver superior value to all stockholders, and bolster a critical contributor to American technology,” Jacobs said. Jacobs’ attempt this week to put together an offer to acquire Qualcomm by reaching out to investment firms including SoftBank Group Corp’s (9984.T) Vision Fund was a result of his disaffection, the sources said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Qualcomm shares rose less than 1 percent to $61.15 in after hours trading following the decision on Friday, giving the company a market capitalization of around $90 billion. Without an existing company as acquirer, Jacobs is attempting to put together the largest leveraged buyout of all time, three times as large as the 2007 $45 billion buyout of Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings, which ended in bankruptcy. Jacobs holds about 1.3 million shares of Qualcomm, less than 0.1 percent of outstanding shares, according to Qualcomm’s security filings. Even if SoftBank, a Japanese telecommunications group with technology investments around the world, wanted to join Jacobs’ bid, it could face conflicts given its ownership of British chip designer ARM Holdings Plc, sources said on Thursday. Given that Qualcomm’s board director slate faces no competition, the re-election of Qualcomm’s nominees is assured. However, limited support for Qualcomm’s directors could put pressure on Mollenkopf.

1151,QCOM,Former Qualcomm chairman explores long-shot bid for U.S. chip maker: sources,"(Reuters) - Former Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) Chairman Paul Jacobs has informed its board of directors that he will seek to partner with investment firms to make an offer for the U.S. semiconductor company, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Jacobs’ attempt to put together an offer comes just a few days after Qualcomm fended off a $117 billion hostile bid from Singapore-based rival Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) thanks to an order by U.S. President Donald Trump prohibiting the deal due to national security concerns.  Qualcomm does not view Jacobs’ attempt to put together a buyout bid as credible, the sources said. Jacobs has held talks with several investment firms, including SoftBank Group Corp’s (9984.T) Vision Fund, but has so far been unable to secure the necessary financing, the three sources added. Jacobs is attempting to put together the largest leveraged buyout of all time, three times as large as the $45 billion buyout of Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings, which ended in bankruptcy.  Even if SoftBank, a Japanese telecommunications group with technology investments around the world, wanted to join Jacobs’ bid, it could face conflicts given its ownership of British chip designer ARM Holdings Plc, the sources said. Adding to the potential conflicts, Qualcomm is an investor in the Vision Fund. SoftBank’s deals are also subject to review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the U.S. national security panel that also objected to Broadcom’s bid for Qualcomm. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Qualcomm declined to comment, while Jacobs and SoftBank could not be immediately reached for comment. The Financial Times first reported on Jacob’s buyout efforts earlier on Thursday. Jacobs, who still sits on Qualcomm’s board, was stripped of his title of executive chairman earlier this month when Jeffrey Henderson, another Qualcomm director, was named non-executive chairman. While Jacobs shared the view of Qualcomm’s board that Broadcom’s bid undervalued the company and was fraught with regulatory risks, many on Qualcomm’s board blamed him for the dissatisfaction of some Qualcomm’s shareholders with the company’s handling of Broadcom’s bid, according to the sources. Jacobs, whose father Irwin co-founded Qualcomm, is up for re-election as board director, alongside other Qualcomm nominees, at the company’s shareholder meeting on March 23. Proxy advisory firm ISS on Wednesday recommended to Qualcomm shareholders that they vote for Broadcom’s four nominees on Qualcomm’s 11-person board, even though their nominations have been withdrawn, as a form of protest. Given that Qualcomm’s board director slate faces no competition, the re-election of Qualcomm’s board directors is assured. However, limited support for Qualcomm’s nominees could put pressure on Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf, who was criticized by some investors for inviting CFIUS to review Broadcom’s bid, to make changes to the company’s strategy.

1152,QCOM,SoftBank could relist British chip designer ARM - FT,"(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp could relist ARM Holdings, the British chip designer it bought two years ago, according to a senior executive at the Japanese conglomerate, the Financial Times reported on Monday. Yoshimitsu Goto, a senior corporate officer at SoftBank, suggested to investors that an initial public offering could be a potential exit strategy for an investment fund that SoftBank launched last year, the FT reported. The $93 billion Vision Fund, backed by Saudi Arabia’s main sovereign wealth fund and companies including Apple and Qualcomm, is set to acquire a 25 percent stake in ARM, the report added. SoftBank did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.

1153,QCOM,Qualcomm re-elects board of directors with tepid support,"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) re-elected its board of directors on Friday with weak support from shareholders, who grilled the U.S. chipmaker over its strategy following its successful defense against a $117-billion hostile bid from Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O). Qualcomm has been under pressure to defend its decision to take Broadcom’s bid to a U.S. national security panel for review. This resulted in U.S. President Donald Trump blocking the deal earlier this month over concerns the acquisition would set the United States back in its race against China to develop 5G wireless technology. The re-election of Qualcomm’s directors was not in doubt on Friday given that Trump had ordered Broadcom to drop its challenge to Qualcomm’s board and withdraw its nominees. However, the investor support the Qualcomm directors received was lower than in most cases where directors run for election unopposed.  Some of the directors were elected with more than 50 percent of the vote. The rest, including Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf, received support in the range of 40 percent to 50 percent, according to sources familiar with preliminary results of the shareholder vote.  “Anything below 80 percent to 90 percent of votes cast is kind of questionable, 40 percent is very questionable. (Trump)has created some breathing room for Qualcomm. Hopefully, they will use it wisely and improve both their Board and company,” said Kevin McManus, vice president and director of proxy services for Egan-Jones Proxy Services.  Ahead of Friday’s meeting, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc, a shareholder advisory firm, had urged investors to lodge protest votes for Broadcom’s withdrawn board nominees, even though they would not be counted under the company’s rules. Mollenkopf told investors following the company’s rejection of Broadcom’s bid that he could achieve earnings per share of $6.75 to $7.50 in fiscal 2019, through a number of measures, including a $1-billion cost reduction program and the resolution of licensing disputes, including with Apple Inc (AAPL.O).  One shareholder at the meeting asked whether Qualcomm planned to return some or all of its offshore cash to shareholders “who have seen the shares go up to $80 and now is at $55” but “have been faithful. How about a little of that (cash)?” Qualcomm CFO George Davis said the company’s offshore cash was already earmarked for use in the company’s $44-billion acquisition of chip maker NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI.O), which is pending clearance from Chinese regulator MOFCOM. “That doesn’t sound close to $80,” the shareholder responded. Davis pointed to the company’s earnings goal for its fiscal 2019. “That probably sounds more like $80,” Davis said.  Qualcomm last week said its board would shrink to 10 directors from 11 because former chairman Paul Jacobs, the son of Qualcomm’s co-founder, would not be renominated for the board after disclosing his intention to pursue a long-shot bid to take the company private. Qualcomm shares closed down 1.9 percent on Friday at  $53.66. NXP shares ended down 0.7 percent at $120.19, their lowest level since Qualcomm revised its NXP bid last week, amid investor concerns that China will block the deal.  In response to a shareholder question about MOFCOM’s delay in approving the NXP deal, Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm’s legal chief, said that Qualcomm had been “actively engaged” with Chinese regulators “as recently as this week.”  Mollenkopf said he believed the company would close the NXP deal on schedule and noted he was headed to China for a conference immediately after the shareholder meeting. But in response to separate shareholder question about U.S.-China relations, he said Qualcomm has little visibility into broader trends between the two nations. “This is a little bit of uncharted territory for all of us,” Mollenkopf said. “We have developed a strong China-friendly, U.S.-friendly business model.” On Friday, Broadcom said its shareholders had voted to redomicile the company from Singapore to the United States. The company is hoping this will make its future acquisitions exempt from reviews from the U.S. security panel, known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. However, Trump’s order prohibiting a Broadcom bid for Qualcomm continues to apply even after the redomiciling to the United States.

Broadcom, which was a U.S. company until it was bought in 2016 by Singapore’s Avago, had announced its plan to redomicile on Nov. 2, days before making its first offer for Qualcomm.

The fundraising comes during a government push to make China an international leader in artificial intelligence (AI) by 2025, by which time it aims to grow core AI industries’ value to 400 billion yuan ($63.33 billion). SenseTime raised $600 million in its series-C funding round having attracted investors including Chinese e-commerce company Suning.Com Co Ltd and Singapore state fund Temasek Holdings (Private) Ltd [TEM.UL], it said in a statement on Monday. The company did not disclose its valuation, but said it is now the world’s most valuable AI platform. It also said it set a world record for the amount raised in a single funding round by an AI firm. SenseTime was valued at $1.5 billion in July after it raised $410 million in its series-B funding round, led by China’s CDH Investments and state-backed fund Sailing Capital. The two people who disclosed the current valuation declined to be identified as the matter was private. A SenseTime spokeswoman declined to comment on the valuation as the firm has moved into the series-C+ round of fundraising.

1169,QCOM,Qualcomm to refile China antitrust application for $44 billion NXP takeover: sources,"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM.O) will refile as early as Monday an application with the Chinese government to clear its $44 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O), sources said, giving regulators more time to decide on the deal and averting a collapse.  The San Diego-based firm withdrew its earlier antitrust application on Saturday at the request of China’s commerce ministry, just days before the regulator’s April 17 deadline to decide on the transaction expires, the sources said. Clinching the NXP takeover, the world’s biggest in the semiconductor sector, is crucial to Qualcomm, which is seeking to diversify its customer base and become the leading chip supplier to the fast-growing automotive market.  The U.S. chipmaker has already received approval from eight of nine required global regulators to finalize the acquisition, with Chinese clearance the only one pending. By refiling, Qualcomm will provide the Ministry of Commerce (Mofcom) potentially with another six-month window to review its application. It will be the second time Qualcomm would be refiling its antitrust application with Mofcom. Analysts, however, said a decision by Mofcom on the deal is unlikely to come before trade and investment tensions between China and the United States are resolved.  “Qualcomm is going to have to wait for Washington and Beijing to resolve their differences before this deal is going to move forward,” said Erick Robinson, director of patent litigation and licensing at Beijing East IP.      Earlier this month, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump proposed $50 billion worth of tariffs on some 1,300 industrial, technology, transport and medical products to force changes in Beijing’s intellectual property practices. Beijing immediately responded with a list of proposed duties of $50 billion on key American imports. China’s isn’t blocking the deal, “but they are holding it hostage”, said Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China and North Asia at risk consultancy Control Risks, adding he had heard about Qualcomm’s application withdrawal and planned refiling. Qualcomm was facing the “perfect storm” for a U.S. company in China, he added. “It’s at the heart of everything: there’s a national security angle, there’s a competitive and Chinese industrial policy angle - so it’s caught up in all the trade war stuff.” Qualcomm declined to comment. Mofcom didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.     Antitrust concerns were believed to have been raised during the most recent round of discussions, but Qualcomm’s position was these were unfounded and not related to the deal, the sources said. Qualcomm is understood to have offered a series of guarantees to Mofcom to assure that NXP customers wouldn’t need to also purchase Qualcomm licenses. The U.S. chipmaker, which initially announced its bid for the Dutch semiconductor company in October 2016, said in February that it was raising its bid to $127.50 per share, valuing NXP at $44 billion. That sweetener came weeks before Trump, citing national security, ordered rival Broadcom Ltd (AVGO.O) to halt its proposed $117 billion buyout of Qualcomm.‍​     Shares in Qualcomm have dropped about 13 percent since the start of the year, while NXP stock has shed about 3 percent over the same period.

1172,QCOM,U.S. strike on China's ZTE another blow for Qualcomm,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - A move by the United States to ban American firms selling components to the Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp will also hit a target closer to home: Qualcomm Inc, a U.S. company that is a major supplier of chips for ZTE’s phones. The U.S. Department of Commerce slapped a seven-year ban on sales to ZTE on Monday for breaking terms of an agreement reached last year after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran.  Caught in the crossfire is Qualcomm, whose products account for the lion’s share of chips inside ZTE smartphones. The Chinese company shipped an estimated 46.4 million phones last year, according to IHS Markit. “If you look at ZTE it sells around 45 million smartphones per year globally, and almost half of them have Qualcomm chips,” said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Research. “So if you look at an average of 25 dollars per chip set that’s close to half a billion dollars in revenue.” Canalys, a technology consultancy, estimate that a higher 65 percent of ZTE phones contain Qualcomm chips. Loss of business could be just the start for the U.S. company, which had sales of $22 billion last year. As Washington and Beijing square off with threats of tariffs and trade barriers, Qualcomm is a clear target for retaliation. Technology is the crux of the tensions.  China wants to boost domestic champions like Huawei, which also makes chips. The United States, meanwhile, concerned about China’s growing might, has shot down Chinese technology deals overseas, citing national security concerns. That puts Qualcomm, which makes the bulk of its sales in China, in an awkward position. “Domestically there are competing attitudes: for someone like Huawei, Qualcomm is the enemy,” said Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China and North Asia at Control Risks. “But for many smaller Chinese phone makers they are actually very dependent on Qualcomm.” Qualcomm, which has government and defense contracts at home, is closely tied to the United States government; it is also grappling with regulator approval in China for a $44 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors. It may, ironically, get hit by the ZTE issues more in the United States than in China. ZTE, while China’s second-largest telecommunication equipment maker, has dropped out of the top ten in terms of domestic smartphone sales in recent years, according to Canalys, as rivals such as Huawei, OPPO, Vivo and Xiaomi have surged. But in the United States it is the fourth largest smartphone vendor after iPhone maker Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics of South Korea. ZTE held 11.2 percent of the U.S. market last year, according to data from the consultancy Canalys. Its phones in the United States use chip sets and processors from Qualcomm, according to company specifications on its U.S. website, which showed all its “signature” phones using Qualcomm chip sets such as Snapdragon 820 and Snapdragon 617. “Most carriers want Qualcomm chip sets in the United States, so basically they are in deep trouble,” said Shah, referring to ZTE. He estimated the United States at close to one fourth of the company’s handset business. “They’d be losing one of their biggest markets.” Qualcomm was not immediately available for comment. The ZTE issue could create a triple threat for Qualcomm: the loss of an important customer, rivals bolstered as they step in to fill the vacuum, and a potential hit as China looks to retaliate against the United States. China’s commerce ministry said Tuesday that it will closely monitor the ZTE case and be prepared to take action to protect the interests of Chinese firms. The impact of the trade war is already being felt. Qualcomm withdrew, and plans to refile, an antitrust application for its pivotal NXP deal on Saturday at the request of China’s commerce ministry, sources told Reuters. Qualcomm’s shares dropped 1.7 percent on Monday. Smaller U.S. optical components firms such as the ZTE supplier Acacia Communications fell more steeply. Counterpoint’s Shah said ZTE could now look to rivals like Samsung, Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc or China’s Spreadtrum for alternative chips. Huawei on Tuesday repeated a long-held policy of not selling its Kirin chips to outside parties.      Shah added, however, that ZTE phones might need expensive redesigns and other chips wouldn’t have the same level of performance: “Either way the costs will be high for ZTE.” ",4172018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-zte-qualcomm-analysis/u-s-strike-on-chinas-zte-another-blow-for-qualcomm-idUSKBN1HO0XT
1173,QCOM,Factbox: U.S. bans sales to major Chinese telco equipment vendor ZTE,"(Reuters) - The United States has banned American firms from selling parts to China’s ZTE Corp for seven years, a potentially devastating move for the telecoms equipment maker and exacerbating tensions between the world’s two largest economies. Below are key facts about ZTE:     ZTE, China’s second-largest telecom equipment maker, is publicly traded but its largest shareholder is a Chinese state-backed enterprise. The firm, set up in 1985, is 30.34 percent owned by Zhongxingxin, which was formed by three shareholders that include a subsidiary of state-owned research institute China Aerospace Electronics Technology Research Institute, and state-owned technology firm Aerospace Guangyu. ZTE has shares listed in Shenzhen and Hong Kong and has a market capitalization of $19.62 billion. On Tuesday, both the Hong Kong and Shenzhen-listed shares were suspended. In 2017, ZTE agreed to plead guilty and pay nearly $900 million in a U.S. sanctions case after a five-year probe found the company conspired to evade U.S. embargoes by buying U.S. components, incorporating them into ZTE equipment and illegally shipping them to Iran. The company agreed to a seven-year suspended denial of export privileges, activated upon any further violations. Yin Yimin Yin has been chairman and executive director of ZTE since 2017. He previously served as the company’s president from 2004 to 2010, and also led ZTE Capital and Zhongxingxin.     Zhao Xianming Zhao has been president and executive director since 2017. He joined the company in 1998 and later led the firm’s research and development group before being promoted to chief technology officer in 2015. He served as chairman of the company from 2016 to 2017, a role he handed over to Yin. In the year ended December 2017, ZTE reported 4.57 billion yuan ($727.53 million) in net profit, compared with a net loss of 2.36 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 7.5 percent to 108.8 billion yuan. The Chinese market generated 62 billion yuan of revenue, or roughly 57 percent of the total. Excluding China, Asia contributed 14.5 percent, followed by Africa on 3.5 percent. Europe, the Americas and Oceania contributed 25 percent to total revenue. The telecoms network business is ZTE’s biggest source of revenue, earning 63.8 billion yuan last year, or 59 percent of the total, while its consumer business, which includes smartphones, generated 32 percent. Government and corporate clients contributed 9 percent. ZTE is China’s second-largest telecoms equipment maker after Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and one of the world’s leading network gear providers, competing with Sweden’s Ericsson and Finland’s Nokia. In smartphones, ZTE, once one of China’s top smartphone sellers, shipped 44.9 million units last year, becoming the 9th largest vendor globally, according to research firm Counterpoint. In recent years, it has lost ground to home rivals such as Huawei, OPPO and Vivo in China. In the United States, it is ranked the fourth-largest smartphone seller after Apple Inc, Samsung and LG Electronics Inc, according to Canalys. Major suppliers include chipmakers such as U.S.-based Qualcomm Inc, South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Taiwan’s Mediatek Inc, as well as optical component firms such as Acacia Communications Inc, Lumentum Holdings Inc, Finisar Corp and Oclaro Inc. In its annual report, ZTE said it had bought goods worth 3.17 billion yuan from its largest supplier, which accounted for 5.5 percent of its supplies. Purchases made from ZTE’s five largest suppliers amounted to 10.61 billion yuan, or 18.3 percent of its total supplies. ZTE owns nearly half of Nubia Technology Co Ltd, one of its five largest suppliers. It did not identify the other four. ZTE employed 74,773 employees in 2017. R&D; personnel accounted for 38.7 percent of the total workforce.  Its annual R&D; expenditure is equivalent to more than 10 percent of its sales revenue, as it operates 20 R&D; centers in China, the United States, Sweden, France, Japan and Canada. ZTE had patent assets of over 69,000 items as of end-2017.

1178,QCOM,TSMC's smartphone warning points squarely at Apple: analysts,"(Reuters) - Shares in Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and its suppliers fell on Thursday after a raft of analysts read a prediction of softer smartphone sales from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW) as driven chiefly by concern about demand for iPhones. TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple supplier, revised its full-year revenue target to the low end of its earlier forecast. “Apple represents nearly 20 percent of TSMC’s revenue so the outlook potentially points to weaker-than-anticipated iPhone demand,” Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell told Reuters. Others, some asking not to be quoted, said baldly that the warning was “exactly” about Apple. Mizuho Securities USA said in a client note that its checks continue to point to soft demand for iPhone X, the Cupertino-based firm’s tenth anniversary phone released last November, in addition to a steady fall in iPhone 8 and 8 Plus orders. Apple’s shares were last down 2.5 percent and were the biggest drag on the tech-heavy Nasdaq index. Shares of Apple suppliers including Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Qorvo Inc (QRVO.O), Skyworks Solutions Inc (SWKS.O) and Broadcom Inc (AVGO.O) fell by 2 percent to 5 percent. “Until the new iPhones in the Fall start driving the production food chain in Q3, mobile’s going to be weak,” Elazar Advisors analyst Chaim Siegel said. TSMC, also a supplier to Qualcomm and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), said it expects growth this year of 5 percent for the global semiconductor industry, weaker than an earlier forecast of 5-7 percent. Data provider TrendForce had earlier estimated 2018 global smartphone production at around 1.5 billion units, 2.8 percent up on 2017 but down from a previously expected 5 percent. TSMC on Thursday estimated 8 percent growth for contract chipmakers, compared with its previous forecast of 9-10 percent. U.S.-listed shares of TSMC (TSM.N) were down 6 percent, while other chip equipment makers such as Applied Materials Inc (AMAT.O) and Lam Research Corp (LRCX.O) fell about 5 percent and ASML Holding NV (ASML.O) lost 3.6 percent. Another big industry bellwether, chip equipment maker Lam Research, said on Wednesday its shipments missed consensus estimates for the first time in five years.

1179,QCOM,TSMC trims full-year revenue estimate on weaker smartphone demand,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW), the world’s largest contract chipmaker, revised its full-year revenue target to the low end of its earlier forecast due to softer demand for smartphones and uncertainty in cryptocurrency mining market. Revenue for 2018 is likely to grow 10 percent rather than the earlier forecast of 10-15 percent, Co-Chief Executive C.C. Wei told an earnings briefing. “The China market started to pick up in smartphones, but TSMC’s smartphone segment, which is very high end, was softer,” Wei said. The comments come after industry data showed worldwide smartphone shipment volumes shrank for the first time last year, with high-end brands coming under increasing competition from the likes of low-cost Chinese vendor Xiaomi. TSMC said it expects growth this year of 5 percent for the global semiconductor industry, weaker than an earlier forecast of 5-7 percent, and 8 percent for contract chipmakers, rather than its previous forecast of 9-10 percent. It also said it expects high-performance computing chips to make up 40 percent of the company’s growth over the next five years, from an initial estimate of 25 percent. The chips are used in such quick-growing fields as artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency mining and blockchain. For January-March, the supplier to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) reported a 2.5 percent rise in net profit at T$89.8 billion ($3.1 billion) - in line with market estimates and a record for the first quarter. For the second quarter, TSMC sees revenue in a range of $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion, 10.5 to 12 percent higher than a year earlier. Analysts said second-quarter risks for TSMC include an intensifying trade war between the United States and China, where many of its biggest clients are located. In addition, demand for cryptocurrency-related chips could slow due to increased regulatory scrutiny of the sector as well as price volatility that has seen miners switch to lower-powered chips. TSMC President Mark Liu said he expected minimal impact from a U.S. ban on American companies selling parts to China’s ZTE Corp (0763.HK), a maker of telecommunications equipment and smartphones reprimanded for failing to fully comply with U.S. regulators. “We think the effect is very, very minimal. Currently we are studying the impact on ZTE suppliers but at first glance, we have a very wide customer base, so ZTE, depending on where its suppliers are from ... we being everyone’s foundry, we have a very wide spread ... the impact is minimal,” Liu said. The firm also said it would add $1 billion to its capital spending target this year, bringing the range to $11.5 billion to $12 billion. Prior to the earnings announcement, shares in TSMC closed up 2.7 percent versus a 1 percent rise in the wider market .TWII. The stock has risen around 6 percent so far this year.

Qualcomm had submitted a remedy plan to resolve competition issues, but an initial investigation found these to be insufficient, said ministry spokesman Gao Feng. “This deal will have significant influence in the industry and might have a negative impact on competition,” he said. “Qualcomm’s plan could not easily solve the problems relating to market competition.” China will review the deal “in a fair manner”, he added.  The comments came as some fear that China might use its approval of the deal as a bargaining chip in trade negotiation with the United States. Qualcomm refiled an application with the Chinese government on Monday, seeking clearance for its $44 billion takeover of NXP, giving regulators more time to decide on the deal and avert  its collapse.

1187,QCOM,Qualcomm chip sales indicate some smartphone strength,"(Reuters) - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc’s (QCOM.O) quarterly profit and revenue topped Wall Street forecasts, suggesting that a slowdown in the global smartphone business might be less severe than feared after a string of weak forecasts from suppliers. The results announced in Qualcomm’s smartphone chip business contrasted to those from major mobile phone components makers in Asia, including TSMC (2330.TW) and SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS), which have warned of slower growth in their smartphone chip divisions. While revenue from Qualcomm’s chips division - its largest - rose 6 percent in the three months ended March 25, revenue from the licensing business plunged 44 percent, reflecting the withholding of revenue in a high-profile patent battle with Apple Inc (AAPL.O). Despite the strong quarter for chip sales, the company does see some signs of weakness.  It forecast growth of about 5 percent in modern mobile handsets for the remainder of the year, which is lower than anticipated. Handset prices, however, are higher than expected.  “Qualcomm posted solid results, but its guidance pointed to a softer handset market, particularly in China,” said Moody’s Senior Vice President Rick Lane. Qualcomm also is waiting for Chinese regulators to consider its application to buy chipmaker NXP, a deal that Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf expects to go through. If it does not, Qualcomm plans to use the cash dedicated to the deal for a share buy-back. The deal was held up by diplomatic concerns between countries, rather than Qualcomm-specific concerns, he said. The biggest spat is over a U.S. ban on exports to China’s ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) after it was caught exporting to Iran. Qualcomm said it expects the loss of business with ZTE to lower its profits by 3 cents per share next quarter, though executives also suggested that other smart phone makers that it also does business with may make up for that lost revenue in the longer term. The results come as San Diego-based Qualcomm tries to convince shareholders it can boost earnings by cutting annual costs by $1 billion and resolving the Apple dispute. Qualcomm on Wednesday forecast current-quarter revenue of between $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, and adjusted earnings of 65 to 75 cents per share. Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.32 billion and earnings of 75 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Qualcomm’s quarterly net income fell to $363 million, or 24 cents per share, from $749 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Qualcomm earned 80 cents per share, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of 70 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 4.9 percent to $5.26 billion, topping expectations of $5.19 billion. Qualcomm shares rose 1 percent to $50.25 in after-hours trading on Wednesday. The sentiment also appeared to help boost other chipmakers in after-hours trading, with memory chipmaker Micron Technology (MU.O) up 1 percent to $48.12 after the announcement.

1192,QCOM,Exclusive: Chip wars - China closing in on second $19 billion semiconductor fund: sources,"HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s state-backed semiconductor fund is near to closing a 120 billion yuan ($18.98 billion)investment round for a second fund to support the domestic chip sector and help cut reliance on imports amid a bruising trade standoff with the United States. The National Integrated Circuitry Investment Fund, also known as the “Big Fund”, is close to announcing the establishment of a new fund that will focus on boosting local chip production and technologies, according to three people with knowledge of the plans. Reuters reported this month that Chinese officials were planning to accelerate the development of the domestic chip market, spooked by trade tensions and U.S. sanctions on ZTE Corp (000063.SZ)(0763.HK), a local telecoms equipment firm, that has underscored China’s heavy reliance on imported chips. China’s industry ministry on Wednesday said the fund was raising its second investment round and that it welcomed foreign institutions to take part, without giving details. The fund, which raised around $22 billion in its first outing, has been a target for U.S. politicians concerned that Chinese firms could challenge chip giants in the United States like Qualcomm Corp (QCOM.O), a big supplier to Chinese firms. China is still heavily reliant on imported chips, however, despite making the sector a priority under a push by President Xi Jinping to boost China’s own high-tech sectors, from robotics to electric cars. That reliance became apparent after the United States slapped a 7-year ban this month on sales of products – including chips – to ZTE, which Washington said had violated an agreement reached after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran. ZTE, which uses chips from Qualcomm in many of its phones, has said the ban could threaten its survival. The second fund had been in the pipeline since before recent trade issues and the ZTE case, the people said, but added that Beijing now plans to invest more in the sector overall because of the rising trade tensions. All three asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the National Integrated Circuitry Investment Fund did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CDB Capital Corp will be the main manager for both the first and second funds, and will invest in the new round, according to one of the people with direct knowledge. Potential investors in the second fund include local government-backed funds and state-owned enterprises, the person said. Calls to CDB Capital, the investment arm of China Development Bank, went unanswered on Thursday. The firm did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment. A fourth person said the new fund would focus on three areas: memory chips, integrated circuit design and compound semiconductors such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride. China is hoping to develop local chip technology following the blocking of several high-profile deals for foreign chip firms in the United States and Europe over national security concerns. Some earlier estimates have said the second semiconductor fund would raise between 150-200 billion yuan. The sources said this was off the mark and that people were often prone to overestimating the size of the fund to “make it sound scary”.    The United States Trade Representative referenced China’s semiconductor roadmap, which includes national funding, in a report that authorized U.S. President Donald Trump to levy up to $100 billion in tariffs against China. The Big Fund has previously invested in some 50 companies in the chip industry, including Hong Kong-listed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (0981.HK) and Yangtze Memory Technologies, a 3D NAND flash chip maker.

1193,QCOM,RPT-ZTE tells suppliers China trade row may be factor in U.S. ban - source,"(Repeats story first published late Wednesday; no change to text) By Karen Freifeld NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters) - China’s ZTE Corp held a conference call on Wednesday with major suppliers, during which a company representative suggested the trade dispute with Beijing may have been a factor in last week’s U.S. order banning American firms from selling goods to the smartphone maker, according to a person familiar with the call. The Commerce Department last week banned American firms from doing business with ZTE after the company violated an agreement reached after it was caught selling U.S. goods to Iran despite U.S. sanctions. The ZTE representative on the call said it would be naive to think the ban was ordered in “a vacuum” and was assumed to be connected to the U.S.-China trade war, the person said. The U.S. has threatened to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to warn that it would retaliate if Washington pushes ahead. The U.S. also has taken actions aimed at reducing access to the U.S. by ZTE and Chinese tech company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd amid allegations the companies could be using their technology to spy on Americans. In response to a Reuters request for comment, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said late Wednesday that the order was “a law enforcement matter unrelated to broader trade policy,” according to a statement provided by a spokesman. The conference call took place between ZTE and more than a dozen members of the Semiconductor Industry Association, the person said. “It was a factual update on what happened, what they’ve done since the order was put in place, and what they’re doing to remedy the situation,” a Semiconductor Industry Association spokesman said. “There was no discussion of helping ZTE advocate before the U.S. government.” U.S. companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE’s equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks. Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc, which is one of ZTE’s top suppliers, said on Wednesday the loss of ZTE’s business will hurt its third quarter earnings. Canalys, a technology consultancy, estimated that 65 percent of ZTE phones contain Qualcomm chips. It is not known whether a Qualcomm representative was on the ZTE call and the company declined to comment. A ZTE spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Aside from Qualcomm, ZTE’s other major business partners include Alphabet Inc’s Google, Texas Instruments Inc and GlobalFoundries. ZTE also sent a letter to its business partners on Wednesday, explaining why it believes the seven-year ban was a “drastic action” out of proportion to its misconduct. According to a copy of the letter obtained by Reuters, ZTE said the order should be “very concerning to all,” since it took effect without warning to the industry, without waiting for the results of an independent internal investigation due at the end of the month, and without recognition for all the improvements in its export compliance program. ZTE invested over $50 million in 2017 in improving its compliance program and planned to increase that spending this year, the letter says. The Commerce Department ban was ignited when ZTE admitted in March that while it had fired four senior employees, it had not disciplined or reduced bonuses to 35 others when it said it had. In the letter, ZTE said that once it confirmed the employee bonuses were not reduced and reprimands not completed, it disclosed the information and took “immediate remedial action.” The order “sends the wrong message” to other companies who may be considering settling with the Commerce Department over export control issues, ZTE said. It said it was committed to complying with the order and U.S. export control regulations “while seeking a resolution to the matter on all available fronts and with the support of many of our business partners.” (Reporting by Karen Freifeld in New York and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Chris Sanders & Shri Navaratnam)",4262018,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-zte/rpt-zte-tells-suppliers-china-trade-row-may-be-factor-in-u-s-ban-source-idUSL1N1S305E

1195,QCOM,Qualcomm easing licensing terms in bid to strike deals,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc’s earnings call on Wednesday showed just how far the company is willing to go to preserve one of its core business practices of taking a cut of the selling price of phones. The San Diego-based chipmaker posted quarterly profit and revenue that topped Wall Street forecasts, suggesting that a slowdown in the global smartphone business might be less severe than feared after a string of weak forecasts from other industry suppliers. But Qualcomm’s other line of business - licensing a trove of patents that help make smart phones work - has traditionally driven most of its profits. And that business has dropped sharply over the past year, as revenue attributable to Apple Inc iPhones is withheld amid a legal dispute.  Qualcomm gave two indications on Wednesday it was prepared to accept lower revenue in exchange for maintaining the business structure and avoiding future customer disputes. Most Qualcomm licensing revenue is calculated as a percentage of the selling price of a smartphone. That so-called device-level licensing model has been at the center of regulatory disputes in China, Korea and the United States and also in its disputes with Apple.  On Wednesday, Qualcomm said it would cap the phone price that is the basis of the revenue calculation at $400. More expensive phones, which can sell for $1,000, would still be treated as $400 for the purpose of the Qualcomm license fee. That move follows a Qualcomm decision in November to license some patents that are required for connecting to so-called 5G networks, the next generation of mobile data networks, at a rate of 3.25 percent. The net effect is that Qualcomm keeps its device-level licensing model and likely accepts less revenue, said Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan.  “It’s cheaper for most people,” Chan said. “What Qualcomm is trying to do is ... get everyone to sign a licensing agreement with them so they don’t have to worry too much.” When Qualcomm executives were asked directly by an analyst on the post-earnings conference call whether the company would receive less revenue from 5G patents, they disputed the notion.  “We’re not getting paid less for it,” said Alex Rogers, Qualcomm’s licensing chief. “I think the best way to think about this is building a foundation for long-term stability” for Qualcomm’s licensing business. Chan said that a recent deal with Samsung Electronics Co Ltd also appeared to show that the rate was lower. In February, Qualcomm said it had amended a 2009 Samsung agreement with a new licensing rate as part of a deal to settle a regulatory dispute in Korea. Qualcomm cut its licensing forecast by $300 million for the third quarter and Chief Financial Officer George Davis said just under half of the change was due to changes in arrangements with Samsung and other moves. That, said Chan, indicated a cheaper deal for Samsung. Samsung mentioned the late-January cross-licensing deal amendment with Qualcomm in earnings call on Thursday Asian time, but said it could not reveal any monetary figures due to confidential agreement. Samsung said that “the effect will be limited to future revenue, and there were no one-off reversals of provisioning (during the first quarter).” ",4262018,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-licensing/qualcomm-easing-licensing-terms-in-bid-to-strike-deals-idUSKBN1HX08K

1197,QCOM,REFILE-ZTE tells suppliers China trade row may be factor in U.S. ban - source,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - China’s ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) held a conference call on Wednesday with major suppliers, during which a company representative suggested the trade dispute with Beijing may have been a factor in last week’s U.S. order banning American firms from selling goods to the smartphone maker, according to a person familiar with the call. The Commerce Department last week banned American firms from doing business with ZTE after the company violated an agreement reached after it was caught selling U.S. goods to Iran despite U.S. sanctions. The ZTE representative on the call said it would be naive to think the ban was ordered in “a vacuum” and was assumed to be connected to the U.S.-China trade war, the person said. The U.S. has threatened to impose tariffs on up to $150 billion of Chinese imports, prompting Beijing to warn that it would retaliate if Washington pushes ahead. The U.S. also has taken actions aimed at reducing access to the U.S. by ZTE and Chinese tech company Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] amid allegations the companies could be using their technology to spy on Americans. In response to a Reuters request for comment, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said late Wednesday that the order was “a law enforcement matter unrelated to broader trade policy,” according to a statement provided by a spokesman. The conference call took place between ZTE and more than a dozen members of the Semiconductor Industry Association, the person said. “It was a factual update on what happened, what they’ve done since the order was put in place, and what they’re doing to remedy the situation,” a Semiconductor Industry Association spokesman said. “There was no discussion of helping ZTE advocate before the U.S. government.”  U.S. companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE’s equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks. Chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), which is one of ZTE’s top suppliers, said on Wednesday the loss of ZTE’s business will hurt its third quarter earnings. Canalys, a technology consultancy, estimated that 65 percent of ZTE phones contain Qualcomm chips.  It is not known whether a Qualcomm representative was on the ZTE call and the company declined to comment. A ZTE spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Aside from Qualcomm, ZTE’s other major business partners include Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O) and GlobalFoundries [CSMF.UL].

1200,QCOM,"Qualcomm's patent deals aim to ease Apple, regulator tensions, exec says","(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc has broadened its use of a lower-cost licensing model for the next generation of mobile data networks, a move that could help in contentious talks with two customers including iPhone maker Apple Inc, the wireless tech company’s patent licensing chief said on Monday. The patent business traditionally has supplied much of Qualcomm’s profit but has also spurred conflict with Apple, Samsung Electronics Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd as well as regulators in China, South Korea and the United States.  New deals could lower the licensing rate that Qualcomm receives while making the business more dependable if regulators view the terms favourably and two major customers - Apple and a company widely believed to be Huawei - resolve their disputes and resume paying Qualcomm. “It’s a good context for dealing with the two licensee issues we have now,” Alex Rogers, the head of Qualcomm’s licensing division, told Reuters in an interview, naming Apple but leaving Huawei unnamed as is the company’s policy when a dispute hasn’t become public through a court proceeding. Rogers did not comment directly on the likelihood of resolving either customer dispute. Apple and Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Qualcomm sells chips for mobile phones but has a second, much older business licensing technology for wireless networks. The licensing business has generated global controversy and resulted in billions of dollars in regulatory fines, some of which remain on appeal. Handset makers can licence one of two sets of Qualcomm patents: The full suite that costs makers about 5 percent of the cost of a handset or a smaller set of so-called “standard essential patents” for 3.25 percent, which includes only the  patents needed for gear to work on mobile data networks. In the past, most of Qualcomm’s customers licensed both sets of patents to avoid lawsuits. But Qualcomm has been defusing tensions by making it easier for customers to licence just the smaller, lower-cost set of standard patents and by adding patents for the next generation 5G wireless network to the suite at no additional cost.  That essentially extends a 2015 settlement with China’s chief antitrust regulator. Qualcomm began to licence only its standard patents for 3G and 4G networks to Chinese handset makers for a rate of 3.25 percent. More than 100 device makers have signed on for such deals. “We have not lowered the rate. What we’re doing is including more technology, more (intellectual property) in the offering without increasing the price,” Rogers added. Qualcomm also announced last week that it would assess its patent fees against only the first $400 (£291) of a phone’s net selling price. Rogers said the previous price cap was $500, a figure that was well known among industry insiders but that Qualcomm did not make public.  “What we’re doing here is creating a foundation for stability going forward,” Rogers said, describing Qualcomm’s 5G licensing moves as “regulator friendly”. The question now is whether more handset makers will opt for Qualcomm’s lower-cost standard patents rather than its pricier full portfolio. “What we perceive here is there will be more of a mix than there was in the past of companies opting for (standard essential patents) only,” Rogers said. “How much more, depends on each individual company.” While Qualcomm has made no public disclosures about the status of talks with the two major customers in licence disputes, the company’s approach to licensing patents for upcoming 5G networks will look different than its initial approaches for 3G and 4G networks of years past. “Both of those issues (disputes) are essentially now being handled within the framework of the current programme we’re offering,” Rogers said.

1204,QCOM,Qualcomm to depose Apple services chief Eddy Cue,"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc can depose Apple Inc’s services chief Eddy Cue in addition to Chief Executive Tim Cook, a magistrate judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California ruled on Friday, part of the chipmaker’s effort to determine whether Apple worked with Samsung to focus regulatory scrutiny on Qualcomm. The access to Cue is important because Qualcomm alleges talks between executives at Apple and its rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd were central to its decision to cut off Apple from a stream of nearly $1 billion in licensing rebate payments.  Apple sued Qualcomm early last year, contesting the San Diego-based chipmaker’s licensing practices and asking for those rebate payments back. Qualcomm then sued Apple for patent infringement in several countries. As part of the disputes, Qualcomm is also seeking to ban the import of some iPhones it believes are violating its patents. In the lawsuit in Southern California filed by Apple, Qualcomm has alleged that at a conference in Idaho in 2015, a top Apple executive encouraged Samsung to “get aggressive” in asking South Korean antitrust regulators to pursue action against the chipmaker.  Cook and Cue are regular attendees of a media mogul conference held each year in Sun Valley, Idaho. The Apple executive in question, Qualcomm alleged, explained that a regulatory ruling on Samsung’s home turf would be Samsung’s “best chance” to force Qualcomm to change its licensing practices. Qualcomm did not name the Apple executive cited in its filings. However, the conversation between Apple and Samsung is important because Qualcomm alleges it amounted to Apple “wrongfully inducing” a regulatory action against Qualcomm. Qualcomm said such a move violated a cooperation agreement it had with Apple and that it stopped sending rebate payments to Apple because of that and other violations of the agreement. Apple has argued in court filings that it cooperated with requests from regulators and that Qualcomm improperly retaliated against it for doing so.  Though Qualcomm is known as a chipmaker, its profit has been driven by a patent licensing business. Some of Qualcomm’s practices caused conflicts with customers such as Apple and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], as well as with regulators in China, Korea and the United States.

1208,QCOM,RPT-UPDATE 1-U.S. to reveal winners of drone program that has attracted top companies,"(Reuters) - Major technology and aerospace companies including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and Airbus SE (AIR.PA) are vying to take part in a new slate of drone tests the United States is set to announce on Wednesday, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The wide interest in the U.S. initiative, launched by President Donald Trump last year, underscores the desire of a broad range of companies to have a say in how the fledgling industry is regulated and ultimately win authority to operate drones for everything from package delivery to crop inspection. The pilot program will allow a much larger range of tests than are generally permitted by federal aviation regulators,  including flying drones at night, over people and beyond an operator’s line of sight. The U.S. Transportation Department said it will announce 10 winning state, local or tribal governments to host the experiments on Wednesday. The governments in turn have partnered with companies who will play a role in the tests. Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, who is up for re-election in November, said in a press release the city of Reno was named one of the winners. The city is partnered with Nevada-based Flirtey, a company that has worked on delivering defibrillators by drone, as well as pizza for Domino’s. At least 200 companies spanning 149 applications are vying to be part of the program, a U.S. official said. Many major U.S. companies are part of the winning submissions. Winners include projects focused on package delivery, environmental monitoring, precision agriculture, pipeline oversight and integrating drones near airports, the U.S. official said.   Companies such as Boeing Co (BA.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) have also expressed interest in the program, sources said, though it was unclear whether they had joined applications and what they would be testing. Amazon declined to comment. Airbus, Intel and Qualcomm confirmed they on one or more applications, with Airbus noting it is interested in topics like risk analysis for airspace management. Qualcomm hopes to test network connectivity along with partners Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T; Inc. Raytheon Co (RTN.N) said it had not applied but was in talks with partners who have. Other companies did not immediately answer requests for comment. Changes to U.S. policy that result from the tests are not expected for some time. Package delivery, which can be particularly complex, might not take place until later on during the program. Earl Lawrence, who directs the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s unmanned aircraft systems integration office, told a Senate panel on Tuesday that many of the other projects “could go forward under the FAA’s existing rules, including with waivers where appropriate.” He said after “the 10 selections for the pilot program are announced, the FAA will be reaching out to other applicants, as well as interested state and local authorities, to provide additional information on how to operationalize their proposed projects.” The FAA is also working on proposed regulations to ensure the safety of drones and their integration into U.S. airspace.  The initiative is significant for the United States, which has lagged other countries in drone operations for fear of air crashes. That had pushed companies like Amazon to experiment overseas. In the United Kingdom, the world’s largest online retailer already sends some packages by drone. It completed its first such mission in late 2016, taking 13 minutes from click to delivery.
